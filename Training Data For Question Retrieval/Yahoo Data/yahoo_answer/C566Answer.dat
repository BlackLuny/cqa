JN6LWA6Oaa	Well, yeah I think so I mean if your doing it before having breakfast and you still like half asleep as opposed to the evening when you have eaten well and are pumped, I do it at 6:00pm.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Everyone's body is different, so it's perfectly normal.|`|3pO9RO8Taa	This depends, but I'll try and give you a couple of ideas. First off, it is very important that you take the time before any workout to warm up and stretch. This will increase the blood flow to your muscles and will get your cardiovascular system prepared to handle any sort of workout. Also, if you are lifting when you first wake up, it is important to eat some carbohydrates that will enter your bloodstream in a short period of time because while you sleep your body is burning energy and you are essentially fasting for 6-8 hours. Many people experience fatigue in the morning. <br>  I hope this will help you<br>  <br>  Edit: I will also add that I am like you and have more strength in the evening. I mostly attribute this to my body being warm and loose at this point. When I wake up in the morning I am often stiff and it takes a little time for me to wake up. Hot showers help me a lot.|`|hapZbqwuaa	That goes contrary to popular belief. Certainly most people, myself included feel most energized in the morning, which is why its the most recommended time for workouts. Because of stresses, work, the food we eat and the general modern lifestyle most people are burnt out by evening and plop down in front of the tv or can't wait for bed. In your case one would have to assess your lifestyle, what you eat, your stresses, attitude and so on. I am sure all these combined will provide the answer.|`|cWgfavyTaa	lol<br>  im the opposite but you do make a point<br>  i guess i can test it out and do back on sat. when i go at 8am and see if im weaker..but i dont think so|`|c2IqfXVfaa	I totally think the same thing.<br>  <br>  I'm a runner & I train so much better in the evening. Like 6-7pm. But starting later than 8-8.30pm isn't good for me.<br>  <br>  I guess you're just not a morning person...|`|Oj9TQXAHaa	I am a similar case. I'm actually a runner and find that my highest energy levels are in the evening and poorest in the morning.<br>  <br>  It may have something to do with circadian rhythms (the body's natural time cycles) and I'm sure diet plays a big part too.|`|kSwnlZ7Qaa	that normal many people does not like doing anything in the morning but in the evening they have strength
YXlIg3f5aa	it's just part of being a girl.<br>  it happens randomly.<br>  don't worry too much.<br>  (:|`|d28ed6e6ffd2770c91461a1986db486daa	Not bad. Mine hurt randomly too - they get tender and sore when im taking my bra off etc. Even though im not pregnant and when my periods over! It might be more comfortable to wear a bra for a bit as ive found out keeping them close to your body rates more on the comfort meter xD<br>  <br>  maybe try taking some painkillers if it gets too bad but for me, usually a bra keeps it in check!<br>  x|`|zgQZJUHwaa	You're fine girl<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|LbQ4gBS6aa	nope its normal. :)<br>  mine do it every now and then<br>  it sucks but its a part of being a girl :)|`|fwrfIxIaaa	rub them better

suJHlb8Raa	When you have wet dreams, it's all in your head. As you sleep, you dream of sexy things that makes you sexually aroused. This results to having an orgasm, but you won't feel it. The only thing that you'll know next morning is that semen is all over.|`|XAkLPdhqaa	My wet dreams have all been in my head, I don't subconsciously touch myself. I do physically *** during my hot dream and when I wake up I'm a sticky mess.|`|9wojIiiWaa	i actualy wake up at the very last second to experience the wet dream which is amazing but then u can see the mess ur making :S... but ur just getting aroused to the point of ejaculation|`|yXhczMyjaa	You can have a wet dream and never wake up, or you can wake up during the orgasm. Sometimes you might be touching yourself, but that isn't required, as the body is doing the work and making the prostrate eject the excess semen. I remember waking up two times at the tail end of a wet dream. Both times I did not touch myself, and I did definitely feel the orgasms. Friends have told me that they did find themselves touching themselves during wet dreams. Each person is different and I suppose no two wet dreams are exactly the same. If you happen to wake up during a wet dream, then you get a freebie ***. If not, you might just have a mess to clean up later.
hqFTWFc9aa	Some of the basic home teeth whitening tip or methods of teeth whitening, used by people around the world are as follows:<br>  <br>  1. Application of a paste of lemon juice and salt in the yellowish tint of the teeth is a wonderful way of eradicating that dull color of the teeth.<br>  <br>  2. Rubbing the inner white part of an orange peel in the discolored teeth gives a lovely white shine.<br>  <br>  3. Regular use of paste of bi-carbonate of soda with water removes the surface stain from the teeth.<br>  <br>  4. Dried and powdered Bay leaves combined with dried orange peel also acts as an excellent whitener.<br>  <br>  All these home teeth whitening methods when done regularly can give an excellent result.|`|xBgKqAPHaa	i use a product called Maximum Teeth Whitening . You order it over the internet and for like $30 AUD you get 2 syringes of the whitening gell stuff, instruction booklet and a moulding thing for your teeth and instructions on how to do it.

YCmvBc05aa	If you are really serious about closing the gap, then find out why you have the gap to begin with. <br>  <br>  Most of the time it is because of the thick, fibrous labial frenum.<br>  <br>  Just getting the braces or invisalign will correct it ONLY TEMPORARILY.<br>  <br>  What you REALLY need to do is get a Frenectomy done followed by the Orthodontic Treatment (braces or invisalign) and then use the retainer. <br>  <br>  Get a consultation done first to see if that is the case.<br>  <br>  Good luck !!|`|RzorQUi8aa	no invisalign wont work, get bonding, $500, instant result and reversible|`|AA12239461	Invisalign braces WILL be able to fix gaps in MOST cases but not all. Best get it checked by an othodontist. It can be complicated but a clear brace will probably work and you would also have the opportunity to correct and other slight misalignments in your teeth at the same time,<br>  <br>  Since the braces are clear nobody will know you're straightening your teeth. THere are other options which may be quicker such as bondings etc but they are false teeth essentially, whereas the clear braces will actually move your teeth to the correct position. You may have to wear a retainer at night for years afterwards to stop your teeth moving back very gradually (depends how old u r - if u r young u wont)<br>  <br>  There's some good info at invisalign.com and there's an independdent site at www.clear-braces.org where you can hear from people who have used them<br>  <br>  good luck|`|C2qx8WhEaa	The gap between your upper front teeth is called a Diastema.There are many ways of having this closed.<br>  Your dentist could either place white fillings on the gap facing surfaces of the 2 teeth provided its possible to do so without making the teeth look too wide or unnatural or he could place 2 veneers on these teeth and achieve the same results.<br>  Braces(fixed or removable) can achieve the same but are more expensive and time consuming.<br>  Unless you have other teeth that require also correction in position,i wouldn't recommend invisalign mainly because of cost implications.|`|5d0506fe6f86fded69f53c9e28c5f779aa	Depending on the size of the gap Invisalign could work. I have the same issue and am getting Invisalign. I start my treatment in 2 days and cannot wait to get rid of the gap between my teeth!<br>  <br>  I took some pictures of what my teeth are like now. You could take a look and see if I have a similar gap or not. I go into detail on what my orthodontists recommendations were too, how long they would take and how much each option cost. I ultimately went with Invisalign because they are highly undetectable and I have read about many positive results.<br>  <br>  Below is the blog I'm keeping on my Invisalign experience where you can see some 'before' pictures.

AA11020187	If you decide to write a TV show, please make sure you use correct grammar, as your question doesn’t make sense. Are you asking if "epithelial atypia" is affected by cancer? The answer is no, not when it was examined.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	It has not been effectively proved yes or no. It depends on it being where? Esophageal, etc etc. Debate as far as I can see is still out there.<br>  You could try the Doctor's Show on TV and ask the question via email or phone they may have an answer.

GXiCrhVYaa	Welcome to the club.<br>  <br>  I ordered a "free trial" from Acai Berry Supreme. Later, I noticed an additional $29.95 added to my credit card from that company and had to complain to the company to get a refund. On my credit card bill, the company was listed with a tel no. That is how I got their tel. no. I called them up and had to threaten them with "Your company is all over the internet as a scam" before they agreed to remove the charge. Later they started shipping me more bottles and trying to charge me for them. I called them up again and this time I had backing from my credit card company.<br>  <br>  Check you acai website VERY carefully and you might find their tel no. Call up your credit card company  NOW and explain  the situation to them. Keep copies of all your emails with the acai company.<br>  <br>  Finally, try this website: <a href="http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/reporting.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/re...</a><br>  <br>  For other websites, google "how to report a scam websites."<br>  <br>  BTW, don't feel like a fool. These scam companies are really slick. Good luck.
Zwpagpubaa	Not always.  Sometimes caffeine and your period (like mentioned above) can cause lumpy breasts.  Lumpy breasts are called fiborcystis disease.  They are just lumps not cancer.  It is best to have a mammogram to be 100% sure.|`|25u9sxfsaa	yeah, <br>  but u get lumps in your breasts around your period time, so its usually just that.
cku5S9WLaa	How about exercising and watching what you eat because as you say you feel less moody on the pill.|`|HY8zW1Rraa	a)  The pill is taking hormones a little bit at a time.  It has been calculated according to the day of the month - what type of hormone you need and how much.  <br>  <br>  b)  The injection is simply a big load of hormones at once so that your body "thinks" it is pregnant; you lose your period, gain weight like crazy.<br>  <br>  Any variation on the hormonal theme as in the above two choices drives me crazy!  Hormones are rubbish to your system no matter what people say.  I use the IUD but not the one infused with progesterone.  It has the same effect as hormonal choices a and b above.  Don't think getting your period to disappear is a good thing.  Like they say, "There ain't no free lunch" so there will be, somewhere along the line, a price to pay health wise.<br>  <br>  I got the progesterone-infused IUD 6 weeks after the birth of my daughter and within two days, my breast milk dried up.  I had it replaced with the ordinary IUD version, now I don't even know it's there; have no mood swings at all; weight is stable at 112lbs for years now.|`|Y1LTzXataa	I would say that the pill is better because there are different types of birth control pills. If you get side-effects from one, you can get your doctor to prescribe you a different one. I'm on the levonorgestrel pill and I have no side-effects|`|hObH0vGVaa	I don't think that this is really a question that anyone else can answer for you. Everyone's body reacts in a different way to different methods of contraception. <br>  <br>  I have heard (and experienced) both positive and negative things about both forms of contraception. If you like the injection why don't you go back to your doctor and explain what is going on. With the pill it is often the estrogen component of it that causes mood swings and there are multiple brands of the same product that all contain slightly different levels. Switching to a different brand might solve your problem. <br>  <br>  Just remember to give each one a few months trial as it often takes a while before any side effects are noticeable. <br>  <br>  Good luck and remember that it often takes a lot of trial and error before you find a contraceptive that works for you.|`|DskwNSPPaa	they both make you put on weight and both have hormones in so its what ever suits your body best i would say!
qeNrGoMsaa	Call an ambulance against his will. Someone needs to act responsible.<br>  If he is being stubborn he could be stubborn dead.

OR<br>  Bowel probs.<br>  <br>  Wait and see what the hospital says.|`|9a7b9b80f412db25e4cb8d6d8786a735aa	Hi, Does your dad's pain go into his back? and also when he has an attack can he not get comfortable no matter how he positions himself? Once his pain starts to subside does it subside quite quickly, if so he could be suffering from gall stones, the pain will be on one the right hand side of his stomach and it is terrible  i said it was like being in labour, but at least in labour you have something at the end of it all. I suffered for years with gall stones, undiagnosed because my doctor always said it was something else, Once a locum doctor diagnosed i was taken into hospital and my gall bladder was removed. Get your dad to go to the doctors because gall stones can be dangerous they block the bile duct that leads from the liver to the gall bladder. The only other thing i can think of that your dad could have would be stomach ulcers.  Either way your dad needs to go to the doctors.  If it is gall stones you can email me and i will tell your dad about my operation it was fantastic. Good Luck.|`|H4lJzYtkaa	Hi, it could be secondary to a stone probably somewhere in the urinary tract system (kidney, ureter, urinary bladder) or the gallbladder per se.  Some tests (Plain Film of the Abdomen, Ultrasound, IVP) would help determine its cause.  Tell your dad to see a doctor now.|`|KQpT68AKaa	Why is he so stubborn about going to the doctors? Surely, that is why they are there. There is no stigma attached to seeking advice on this matter. Could well be that some simple medication could sort out the problem. If the problem is more serious he needs to seek attention asap.

L0OyvCYkaa	???????|`|e4zcUQSUaa	Tinea Barbae (Barber's Itch) is actually an infection of the beard and the moustache area of the face.  It is most prevalent in adult males. (I guess you're not male so don't worry about it).<br>  <br>  It mostly affects farmers and is due to direct contact with an infected animal. It is rarely passed from one person to another.<br>  <br>  Symptoms include:<br>  - Presence of papules and crusts on the affected areas.<br>  - Hairs are broken next to the skin and may plug follicles.<br>  - Reddic lesions with pus on the chin, cheeks, and\or neck.<br>  <br>  Home Remedies:<br>  - Apply warm, moist washcloths or compresses to the affect area.<br>  - Try oatmeal lotion to help soothe itchy skin.<br>  - Avoid shaving irritated skin.  If it cannot be helped, use an electric razor rather than a blade, and apply a soothing after-shave lotion.

Or told me, "dude, avoid her... you'll be dodging a bullet."<br>  <br>  It really made me think, until finally, I said to myself, that isn't right. You can't just write a person off as "damaged goods," as "baggage." If that woman's son doesn't marry her, and everyone has that attitude, then is she to be alone for her whole life? That isn't right. He loves her, so he should be able to marry her.<br>  <br>  And then I got to thinking about my wife and I... we both have baggage, but is that how it's supposed to work?

Their arguments - some ill-informed, some plain vitriolic - have all rested on an implicit belief that "a bit of pot" simply does not cause this kind of aggression, this sort of abuse. Yes, they say, if this was a heroin addict, nicking your stereo, your jewellery and flogging it down the pub, that would be credible. And they're right, you don't need to flog a stereo for a spliff - it costs less than a pint. And anyway, cannabis makes you mellow - stoners are hippies, laid back, docile to a fault. We used to smoke it, they imply, and we just giggled.<br>  <br>  That was then. Skunk is GM cannabis. Evidence from the Forensic Science Service suggests that skunk cannabis (otherwise known as sinsemilla) is remarkably stronger than ever before. It is unquestionably different, definitely stronger. In skunk, the active ingredient, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), has been ramped up significantly. But perhaps more importantly, this has been achieved at the cost of another component of naturally occurring cannabis, CBD (cannabidiol). And some scientists are starting to think that CBD has antipsychotic properties - something to offset the THC in old-fashioned marijuana but absent in skunk. But hang on, says the commentariat, you don't see stoners getting violent, abusive. You just don't. And, I agree, anecdotally that feels true. But these are adults they're talking about (and most of them have dropped out, are not being told to get up and go to school at 8am every morning). What happens if you give this potent, psychoactive ingredient to young, still-forming brains? There probably isn't enough certain scientific evidence yet (how long did it take for Richard Doll to gain a following for his cranky smoking-causes-lung-cancer theories?) but the anecdotal evidence is colossal, alarming, unavoidable.<br>  "|`|803d7a60e642d4a568204ac15d119dd0aa	It's true, you'd have to be a doughnut to think drugs (even as mild as cannabis) are completely harmless. <br>  <br>  A friend of mine suffered badly with insomnia after smoking cannabis for about 3 years and my cousin was diagnosed with schizophrenia after 5 years of heavy drug abuse (mainly cannabis), doctors can't completely blame his mental issues on the cannabis but for us his family it was a change in his behaviour that led us to find out he had been smoking weed. He lives in a secure mental unit at the age of 21.|`|AA11809403	i haven't researched this. but i am guessing that those who experience marijuana psychosis were already on their way to psychosis - and it is just that any drug that effects the brain makes the early symptoms more obvious.<br>  <br>  <br>  so, yes, it MAY be real, but marijuana is not the actual cause.|`|4UQegWk0aa	It does exist.

I have felt very uncomfortable after smoking weed, but this tends to be when I am feeling anxious. Some nights I lay there stoned and struggle to relax so in a way it seems rather stupid to smoke weed when I feel anxious as it can make this sensation 10 times worse.<br>  <br>  I recon that weed just enhances the mood that you are in - therefore if stressed/anxious then the weed can intensify these feelings. My advice would be to smoke it in good company and don't let it control your life. <br>  <br>  A quote about weed I once read is that "weed should be the icing on the cake and not the cake itself".

(very fun to watch too lol ) my girlfriend comments on how seamlessly the pole connects and how well the grip is. she is thick so it supports her weight as well (the pole supports up to 220 lbs). this pole is very safe

iK3YYRaTaa	Here is a list of 2,480 foods. It has the Index and load of foods with carbs. This should be your bible for eating for life. No tricky carb. counting. Heres the website.<a href="http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm</a><br>  <br>  The glycemic index (GI) is a numerical system of measuring how much of a rise in circulating blood sugar a carbohydrate triggers–the higher the number, the greater the blood sugar response. So a low GI food will cause a small rise, while a high GI food will trigger a dramatic spike. A list of carbohydrates with their glycemic values is shown below. A GI is 70 or more is high, a GI of 56 to 69 inclusive is medium, and a GI of 55 or less is low.<br>  <br>  <br>  The glycemic load (GL) is a relatively new way to assess the impact of carbohydrate consumption that takes the glycemic index into account, but gives a fuller picture than does glycemic index alone. A GI value tells you only how rapidly a particular carbohydrate turns into sugar. It doesn't tell you how much of that carbohydrate is in a serving of a particular food. You need to know both things to understand a food's effect on blood sugar. That is where glycemic load comes in. The carbohydrate in watermelon, for example, has a high GI. But there isn't a lot of it, so watermelon's glycemic load is relatively low. A GL of 20 or more is high, a GL of 11 to 19 inclusive is medium, and a GL of 10 or less is low.<br>  <br>  <br>  Foods that have a low GL almost always have a low GI. Foods with an intermediate or high GL range from very low to very high GI.<br>  <br>  <br>  Both GI and GL are listed here. The GI is of foods based on the glucose index–where glucose is set to equal 100. The other is the glycemic load, which is the glycemic index divided by 100 multiplied by its available carbohydrate content (i.e. carbohydrates minus fiber) in grams. (The "Serve size (g)" column is the serving size in grams for calculating the glycemic load; for simplicity of presentation I have left out an intermediate column that shows the available carbohydrates in the stated serving sizes.) Take, watermelon as an example of calculating glycemic load. Its glycemic index is pretty high, about 72. According to the calculations by the people at the University of Sydney's Human Nutrition Unit, in a serving of 120 grams it has 6 grams of available carbohydrate per serving, so its glycemic load is pretty low, 72/100*6=4.32, rounded to 4.<br>  <br>  So now your search is over for what you can eat and not to eat.

1YdeUn1Caa	You make this too hard on yourself. Buy a pack of cigarettes. When a smoker goes out for a break Go out too. Light a cigarette too, but don't smoke it. Just let it sit and burn, and you do whatever you want, until it's finished. If someone ask you what you are doing, say you are taking a smoke break. When the cigarette is done, go back to work. <br>  God, do I have help you non smokers with everything? You whine all of the time, but yet us smokers have to bail you out. Now give us a break.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Take up smoking.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	I have always considered that to be unfair also.|`|b4f15f4dd5520347b3d29a388a0d45b2aa	Breaks above the statutory minimum are at the discretion of the employer.

In my opinion, smokers should get their smoking breaks taken off the rest of their breaks.<br>  <br>  Where I used to work, this didn't happen, and some smokers took their morning 15 minutes, 30 minutes for lunch, 15 minutes in the afternoon as well as 3 or 4 5 minutes smoke breaks.<br>  <br>  A group of us non smokers then started taking 5 minute 'not smoking breaks' Soon sorted that out.<br>  <br>  Check out www.direct.gov.uk for more info on break entitlements|`|2DLaybY7aa	And your question is???<br>  <br>  I guess you are complaining about smokers getting a break where you don't?<br>  Don't blame the smokers. The government is happy for smokers to puff as it ensures a nice constant flow of revenue into their coffers (the amount of duty it collects pretty well matches the amount of money it spends on the NHS annually actually).<br>  It is not a smokers fault that the government refuses to ban a substance that is both highly addictive and harmful for health. Smokers are no different to any other addict in respect that we need our regular fix, the only difference being that our drug of choice is legal in this country and doesn't effect our capability of performing our jobs,<br>  It was the government who brought the smoking in public places ban in, so a provision must be made to accommodate us poor addicts - ie. regular break to feed our cravings.<br>  OK, the smoker getting a break during their working day might rub you up the wrong way, but look at it this way - those break for a ciggie are slowly killing them. Wouldn't you rather be working and staying healthy than taking a break to shorten your life? Just be happy that you haven't got a long term addiction to a perfectly legal narcotic, and can take all those smoking breaks at the end of your life when we are already in the ground!|`|PTtKKOP2aa	I work for the nhs and that doesnt happen in the hospital i work in, if the smokers want a ciggy they go in their alloted break time they never get extra breaks
pqnEavSyaa	If the pain is in the upper back of the heel, it could be Achilles tendonitis, a condition that involves the inflammation of the Achilles tendon. The Achilles Tendon is the longest tendon in the body, and its main function is to connect the calf muscles to the heel bone behind the ankle joint.  When the calf muscles contract, they pull on the Achilles Tendon, causing your foot to point down and helping you rise on your toes. Achilles pain occurs just above the back of the heel. Sufferers of this condition also experience tightness in the calf muscles. The Achilles Tendon may be noticeably thickened and tender to the touch in this area.  Pain is present when walking, especially when pushing off on the toes.<br>  <br>  One of the most common causes for Achilles Tendonitis is the flattening of the arches also known as excessive pronation.  When the feet roll inwards and the lower leg is forced to rotate internally, it creates a tearing force on the calf muscles. Since the calf muscles are connected to the Achilles tendon, it turns out to be the 'weakest link' in the chain. The Achilles tendon ends up being overstretched, resulting in irritation and inflammation.<br>  <br>  Over-pronation can be corrected by using orthotic arch supports.

Orthodics can provide the support necessary to prevent the pain of plantar fascia. Each orthodic can be designed specifically to provide accupressure to exact places on the heel, taking weight shifts and pressure points into consideration.<br>  <br>  A podiatrist will take a mold of the foot and analyze the mold to ascertain the location of pressure points where additional support is specifically needed. The mold then gets sent off to an orthodic manufacturer.<br>  Benefits<br>  Wearing orthodics will provide heel pain relief but it may not be instant. While patients are first getting used to the feel of the new orthodics, they may still want to use an anti-inflammatory and ice the heel on occasion. Once the body adjusts to the orthodics, the heel pain will be relieved.<br>  <br>  Patients suffering from severe heel pain will find that once the heel pain is relieved, their overall physical health will feel significantly better. Heel pain can wear on a body, causing headaches and fatigue in addition to the serious heel pain. Heel pain relief will be the beginning of whole new feeling of well being.

There are many ways of getting this actually. It is improper cutting of the nail. The nail bends inwards or upwards depending on the angle with which it has been cut. Looking from the perspective of the owner, when cutting the nail, the cutting tool, such as scissors, are in an attitude where the lower blade is closer to the toe than the upper blade and that will cause the toenail to start growing from its base upwards. Vice versa, when the lower blade is farther than the upper blade, the toenail will turn inwards. The process is visible along the nail as it grows, appearing as a warp that advances towards the end of the nail. The upper corners turn more easily than the center end of the nail. As people cut their nails by holding the tool always in the same angle, they induce these conditions by accident, while as the nail turns closer to the skin, it becomes harder to fit the lower blade in the right attitude under the nail. When cutting a nail, important is not just the right angle, but also how short it is cut. A shorter cut will bend the nail more, unless the cut is even on both top and bottom of the nail.<br>  <br>  Causes include:<br>  <br>     1. Bad maintenance, including cutting the nail too short, rounded off at the tip or peeled off at the edges instead of being cut straight across[2]<br>     2. Ill-fitting shoes, as those that are too narrow or too short can cause bunching of the toes in the developmental stages of the foot (frequently in those under 21), causing the nail to curl and dig into the skin<br>     3. Trauma to the nail plate or toe, which can occur by stubbing the toenail, dropping things on the toe or going through the end of the shoes (as during sports or other vigorous activity), can cause the flesh to become injured and the nail to grow irregularly and press into the flesh<br>     4. Predisposition, such as abnormally shaped nail beds, nail deformities caused by diseases, or a genetic susceptibility to nail problems like ingrowth<br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment of ingrown nails ranges from soaking the afflicted area to surgery. The appropriate method is dictated by the severity of the condition. In nearly all cases, drainage of blood or watery discharge should mean a trip to the doctor, usually a podiatrist, a specialist trained explicitly to treat these conditions. Most practitioners agree that trying to outwait the condition is nearly always fruitless, as well as agonizing.|`|YDIZohC8aa	You prob. have an ingrown toe nail, this is where (usally caused my tight shoes) youcan try to clip it will include digging under the skin, or look up a foot doc.

fuphal1laa	I assume you are trying to loose weight, as you may know the body usually uses glucose to run most of its processes especially to power you brain, if the body is in a starvation state (there is not glucose available) it converts stored fat and muscle into ketone bodies (ketosis) and trys to use these to power the body systems. The theory is that if you have a low carbohydrate diet you can make the body use ketones and there fore burn more fat, but it is quite dangerous to your body, you will feel very tierd, your breath may smell of pear drops and you may digest you mucles which would be a bad thing. When you start eating normally again the weight will go straigh back on again.<br>  Unfortunatly the best way to loose weight is still exercise and a sensible balanced diet that will give you about 1500 calories a day.|`|cHiaawxYaa	Well when a diabetic stops taking medication i.e insulin, the body starts using stored fat for energy instead of the food they have just eaten, this is called Ketoacidiosis.<br>  So i'm guessing that ketosis means your body is actively breaking down the stored fat in your body whilst eating.<br>  Just a guess...|`|W6wamWLLaa	what the hecks ketosis?!|`|rBM87FVLaa	ketosis is a red herring.

Do you really want to change that? Being awake when he is awake might mean that you are able to spend more time together when he gets off work. <br>  <br>  If you do want to stay on a 'day time', more normal, schedule, then there are several tricks you could try. The suggestion to sleep in a different room, at least on the nights when your husband has to get up for work, is a good idea, imo. You might try changing the time you go to bed; go to bed later-you could even wait until your husband gets up, or maybe go to bed a bit earlier so you are in a different, deeper sleep cycle when he gets up. <br>  <br>  Try using some new sleep routines; use these routines when you first go to bed and then if you wake up also. Avoid television, avoid lights. Drink a small amount of something warm, like warm milk or chamomile tea. Use the bathroom, apply some soothing lotion (like Lavender lotion) then back to bed. Listen to soothing music or a book on cd, use guided imagery or breathing techniques to relax yourself. If you keep doing these things consistently you might be able to train yourself to fall back to sleep easily.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	Have you tried sleeping in a different room.

The site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking, and it's free.<br>  <br>  "It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you."|`|UIcItboeaa	You have 3 options: Nictoine replacement to helo you wean down how much nicotine you use (patches, gum, etc), blocking druga (chantif for example) or cold turkey. With NRT, you CANNOT smoke with it because you run the risk of nicotine overdose, but you will have the opion of gradually stepping down how mucn nicotine you get from, say, the patch, without getting the additives found in cigarettes. Chantix, you can smoke for the first week and then need to stop. It works by blocking pleasure receptors in the brain that normally would respond to smoking, thereby making it unappealing. Of note, this si also what leads some Chantix users to often end up feeling depressed because the body often cant determine what source of gratification its supposed to be denying.<br>  Cold turkey can be done, that's what I did. Its very important to know what kinds of things will trigger you to smoke (having a drink, coffee, driving, being around smokers) and coming up with plans for those times. Make sure to have gum with you, alternatie alcohalic drinks with non alcohalic drinks so your inhibtions arent lowered as quickly...theres tons fo things you can do.<br>  If you're interested in NRT, call 1-800-quit-now, almost every state has a smokers quitline, this si the national number, and most of them provide some sort of NRT. For example, I work for the NY state department of healths program as smoking cessation counselor and we usually can provide a 2 week starter kit. You can also buy all kinds of NRT over the counter if youre over 18 and generic brands work just as well as the name brands.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eWEqGHvJaa	One way is to chew nicotine gum between smokes.  Then there is always cutting out one at a time and then two and so on until you are not smoking any more.  Using the patches and gum are ways to stop.  I have never smoked but helped my mother quit.  Cutting back a little at a time is one of the best ways to quit. Other than that cold turkey is the other way that is used by a lot of smokers.  I hope this helps.  Good luck|`|sXfw3qxdaa	It's good that you are trying to stop! I would suggest nicotine patches because even though they contain nicotine, they are waaaay healthier than smokes. You can also cut them down slowly at your own pace. If you still feel like smoking, try sticking a pen in your mouth (that's what my half brother did). If you are still having trouble, you can always call a quitline.|`|iia5857maa	Your an addict  Bob, go to a twelve step.

There was a story about them on Yahoo about a week ago.  I've been smoking for 30 years and have tried everything to quit smoking without any success.  And I bought two packs of cigarettes today that cost me more than $12.  That’s just crazy!  So I will be ordering my electronic cigarette starter package this week and I'm very excited about it.  They simulate a real cigarette which none of the other quit smoking aids have done.  They come with a rechargeable battery, when you inhale, you get a burst of nicotine for that craving and it actually looks like you're blowing out smoke but it's a water vapor mist.  The tip of the cigarette even illuminates.  So you get the nicotine you crave, the hand and mouth fixation is covered and exhaling the vapor mist looks like smoke.  <br>  <br>  The beauty of it is you still get all the stuff you crave from smoking without all the negative side effects or harmful additives found in tobacco.  The starter kit comes with the electronic cigarette, battery, and five nicotine cartridges.  Each cartridge is supposed to be equal to 1-2 packs of cigarettes.  The kit is $79 and the cartridge refills are around $13 for a pack of five.  I will be ordering from the site below.

epBOAXUraa	I'm sorry about your gran.<br>  <br>  The reason for stroke occuring is primarily a blood clot in one of the blood vessels in the brain.  This clot stops blood & oxygen flowing to the areas of the brain and it can cause irreversible damage to the brain tissue.  The longer the clot remains, the more permanent the damage to the brain.<br>  <br>  By achieving medical help (and preferably the correct help ie stroke unit) rapidly, special medication can be administered to break up the clot and restore blood to the damaged area of the brain.  <br>  <br>  Some strokes happen during sleep and symtpoms are not recognised until the clot has been in situ for hours - therefore not everyone can obtain help as rapidly - thus affecting the success of medical treatment and decreasing the chances of a good recovery.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Phone 999 and ask for an ambulance which will take you to hospital where you join the queue.|`|uyQppMYLaa	I'm training to be a speech and ;language therapist, and am hoping to specialise in stroke patients. We were told that in hospital they can carry out an operation to relieve the pressure on the brain and to remove the blood clot that is blocking your blood vessels. They can give the brain the oxygen that it is starved of. Unfortunately unless it happens really quickly there is a high chance that the patient will still have brain damages and will need speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|237228346551130062ef1804a02852d1aa	It does depend on how old you are.  If your grandmother is elderley and has had 3 strokes, I can't see how they would not have tried to help her, although with her condition worsening with every stroke there maybe little they can do if they have tried all different kinds of medication.  Strokes are heredity and it may not matter how healthy you are they can still happen.  When someone have a stroke the ambulance will usually administer something to thin the blood and it is caused by a clot somewhere (usually in the brain).  If treated early enough a person with their first stroke can come out of it fairly well however someone who does not get treatment for over 5 hours or has more strokes tends to more slow to recover and therefore the side-effects are worse.  When the person is in hospital they try to find the place where the clot is by doing different scans and tests and further treatment may be needed.|`|PvAp83TWaa	How or what the emergency team do for stroke victim?<br>  <br>  In simple terms, TRY TO KEEP THEM ALIVE with as less complications or damage as possible.<br>  <br>  Here..

UIcItboeaa	Nicotine is out of the body for a pack a day smoker in 4-5 days. The most important thing you can do is to identify your triggers and plan for ways to address them. For example, if you smoke after a meal, get up from the table and find an activity to do away from where you would normally have that after dinner cigarette. Chew some gum, use some mouthwash to get the full feeling of food out of your mouth. Cinnamine and peppermint candies/gum work really well because you immediately get a new strong feeling to replace those of a smoke.<br>  Make sure to drink lots of water and stay hydrated, there are over 4000 chemicals in cigarettes and you need to start flushing out those toxins. Smoking tea is going to have its own issues, but I see where you're going with it.<br>  Make sure you have things to do with your hands if you find you have some challenging idle time- crossword puzzles, a household chore, exercise. While it seems like it lasts forever, the actual physical urge to smoke only lasts between 4 and 6 minutes.|`|JTQ84aLKaa	I was a heavy smoker from the age of 12.<br>  20 cigarettes a day as well as my pipe and cigars in the evening.<br>  <br>  One day I found myself without any tobacco in the house.

Like on an hour then get to one every other hour then every 2 hours then 3 then 4 & keep doing this til you notice you only are smoking one at 8am & noon & 4pm So if you only smoke 5 now stretch them out though out the day evenly...I hope this makes sense. I think doing this with food keep me from craving. Now I can even skip a snack but never a meal. Even if you end up smoking 3 cigs a day wouldn't that be better than a large amount so be patient but keep doing better as time goes on...If you have a bad day just say "that's ok, I am still healthier than I used to be" & work out your stress another way & get back on track.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	It depends on the individual and the extent of the addiction. Some can do it within two weeks others have to         do it gradually perhaps over 6 months. Best of Luck !

xfgVGqvXaa	Have you talked to your doctor about the best treatment for candida?  There are some diseases where patients tend to suffer an allergic reaction to the dying disease organisms, but candidiasis is not one of them.<br>  <br>  Candida is generally treated with anti-fungal drugs, not probiotics.  I can see the logic, that adding 'good bacteria' squeezes out yeast.  Unfortunately it seems not to work in practice, probably because you can never get rid of all the candida.<br>  <br>  I'd be interested to know how it goes, anyway (my email is pete@friendlyfrog.net).  I'd never heard of the candida spit test or threelac until today!
ozWi3TJlaa	It sounds like classic influenza symptoms.  If you can get to the doctor within the first 24 hours, they can give you tamiflu, which will make the symptoms last for less time.  Otherwise, you mostly just sleep it off and take in plenty of fluids.  I had it earlier in February and didn't feel right for almost a week, but I'm in my forties.  It takes longer, the older you get.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctor anyway, just to be sure.|`|lRSemsJGaa	Sounds like an infection maybe.

Does your heart rate stay up all the time, or only when you are hot.  This may be due to your temperature.  If you feel really worried can you ring the doctor and tell them it is urgent.  If you start vomiting or feeling more unwell I would do that.|`|EXV9Gvzzaa	Well, sometimes I get like that when I first get up. You may have slept the wrong way.

fZ3FXZMyaa	When I was younger around 11 years old, I would stare up in to the sun closing one eye and I would put my finger up to my face and count to three.  Bright lights also.  It was embarrassing, my mother would not like to take me out and made excuses for me.  Now I am 30 and the eye that I would stare at the lights with makes things look darker.  I had a lot of psych problems but was never checked.  I got a job and at 21 got into therapy.  While I have a cousin who has autism, I had OCD.  I really feel for your brother.  It takes will power not to look, I know this will sound bad but try to get him to do something else a distraction and continue with the sunglasses so there will be less damage to the eyes.|`|AA11809403	it is probably a light seizure.<br>  i have had this experience - i turn away from bright lights, even if they don't flicker.|`|NPMKqJlMaa	take him to a doc cos this could be very serious.. he can even become blind if he keeps on staring the "SUN"!!! take him to a doctor...|`|xTvI7Qo3aa	i dont think the problem is with his eyes ive seen autistic ppl that sit (or stand) and pass there hands in front of their eyes quickly causing a strobe effect  which may be a similar manifestation of autism might suggest getting him some Photogrey glasses  that adjust themselves to the ambient light  ..and btw staring into the sun can cause serious and permanent eye damage the phrase "stop that or youll go blind" comes to mind..|`|hEJ5GCPCaa	that is pretty strange idk how old u or he is but tell ur mom or try and get somehelp if it bothers u and him that much

After that it gets tough to put on weight (for skinny people like you and I) and a gainer is just so convenient, though expensive.  I do enjoy my cytogainer, but I don't have it that often since it's kinda expensive.  Bodybuilding.com has 6lb tubs for 38 bucks though and GNC does price matching.  I'll be on my 2nd little tub because I want to find a flavor that I really like.

s2jyGuJ4aa	Don't listen to the other two answers above: they are not sourced and rather harsh diagnoses that most likely step beyond the contributor's credentials.  First off, the panic/anxiety disorder could have played a part into his problem.  Once a person continually has such a disorder, they will begin to fear whatever illicits the anxiety response.<br>  <br>  Perfectionism is a great example of this:  If he has placed tremendous time and energy into being "perfect" then he obviously has some underlying fear of being inferior by being "imperfect."  This is what's called a "Cognitive Disortion" and can be worked on in therapy sessions with a counselor or psychologist that is trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.<br>  <br>  Moving on, anyone who suffers from perfectionism (as I once did) will struggle with his or her self-esteem.  He is constantly uncomfortable with himself because he cannot measure up with his "ideal self."  This pattern of thinking is very unrealistic and unrational and can lead to many of the problems that you and him are experiencing.<br>  <br>  Since he has low self-esteem, he distorts the reality that people need time to themselves; instead, he sees it as if you want to leave him.<br>  <br>  The best thing is that you recognize that your husband is a good guy with a good heart.  You can help him by having him talk with a therapist (preferrably a psychologist that does Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and by having him work out these perfectionistic notions with the therapist.<br>  <br>  He will get better, once he becomes comfortable with himself enough to seek therapy.|`|V1ptCwtIaa	compulsive psychotic disorder|`|AA11809403	it all fits with the childhood you describe.  i have some of it myself.<br>  <br>  you might look up SCHIZOID ( which is not the same as schizophrenic.)   several of his behaviors fit that, which also fits with his childhood.

UL3XOKJxaa	I always suggest that you brush to remove any remaining material from the teeth, which would be immediately after removing the strips.
LCHnUuS6aa	It depends.  If the scars were caused by dangerous conditions or faulty equipment (e.g. a test tube exploding in a lesson because of faulty materials or insufficient supervision) then you could possibly sue the school.  If you tripped in the playground, or another kid injured you, then probably not.  Get your parents to consult a lawyer.  Many law firms offer free short appointments to discuss personal injury claims and whether or not they are worth pursuing.|`|PFCfKKtSaa	i don't think so. It doesn't sound like it's done any serious damage. but the main reason, how did it happen? how exactly were the school involved in it, besides the fact of you being there at the time?<br>  <br>  you need much more information besides saying you have a few cuts on your face for a question like this.|`|81cc676a9f6480a6140de7b2b4ae739eaa	Yes you can...<br>  just go to court and have your proof

F32uPjAraa	Yes you are eating too much. Your food is not leaking out, that is the problem. Your belly button is growing deeper, and deeper. If you keep eating at this rate by the time you are forty, your belly button will be four feet deep, and producing enough lint to manufacture an Akubra hat every three weeks. Since the introduction of the calicivirus into Australia, and the subsequent death of billions of rabbits, Akubra has had to resort to importing rabbit lint to manufacture their hats. So you have a potential wealth factory in you belly. Keep up the good work.|`|KrpnKhFTaa	yes, lint monsters usually bed down at night in your belly button...(if you're an inny) ...the "cotton" you see is probably taken from the blanket ...they use it for bedding.|`|00BBp75kaa	Relax! It's belly button lint. This phenomenon seems to be more common with guys. Navel lint is made mostly of stray fibers from clothing, fabrics (towels), mixed with some dead skin cells and strands of body hair. Body hair also helps transport the lint into the belly button area. The lint is pretty harmless, but you can get rid of it if you want to.<br>  <br>  Here's a tip for clean out your belly button:<br>  1) Lay down<br>  2) Pour some baby oil onto your belly button<br>  3) Wait a few minutes<br>  4) Swish a q-tip around to absorb the oil<br>  5) Use as many q-tips to gently scrape out any "dirt/lint"<br>  6) Repeat this process as many times and as often as you'd like<br>  <br>  It's not possible for your food to just start leaking out through your belly button, so don't worry. Again, the stomach is NOT connected to the belly button. The belly button is just evidence that we were nurtured by our mothers during their pregnant stage. A growing fetus/baby in a woman's uterus requires oxygen and nutrients. Oxygenated blood and nutrients are absorbed by the fetus via the umbilical cord (the bellybutton is the remnant of where this cord was cut off after we were born). :)|`|dZ8y8KwHaa	Maybe, but it could also be the lint monsters. They roam at night and stuff your belly buttons full of lint and cotton.|`|Mrkchaemaa	cool

People who withdraw from nicotine often get constipated, get stomach ache and suffer from flatulence!<br>  <br>  Good news is, though, that if you do decide to stop all together the symptoms will go away (although this might take a few weeks - but it will eventually stop).<br>  <br>  Discussion between people withdrawing from nicotine about the side effects can be found on many forums such as this: <a href="http://www.nosmokingday.org.uk/forum/showthread.php?t=7056&highlight=fart" rel="nofollow">http://www.nosmokingday.org.uk/forum/sho...</a><br>  <br>  I had terrible stomach problems while smoking, to the point where I was diagnosed as having suspected IBS - then when I stopped (after 16 years as a heavy smoker) my stomach problems started to clear up.<br>  <br>  Please don't think I'm a nagging ex-smoker! I'm not suggesting you quit, just confirming that your stomach pains could well be the result of nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine is an incredibly powerful drug and it really does weird things to your body.<br>  <br>  On a final note - even if you think nicotine withdrawal could be responsible for your health problems, please still get it checked out with your doctor, just to make sure there is no underlying cause.<br>  <br>  And if you ever decide to stop smoking and want a friendly place to discuss your symptoms openly where no one will laugh at you - do have a look at this forum: <a href="http://www.nosmokingday.org.uk/forum/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nosmokingday.org.uk/forum/</a> Everyone on it is non-judgemental, for me it's worked better than getting nicotine patches or having hypnotherapy etc... and, best of all, it's completely free!<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon.|`|sOCLwxnFaa	yeah cos ur body will be used to taking it so much

In very rare cases, it could take up to 6 months for someone to test positive.  (That would only occur if the person already had a weakened immune system prior to HIV infection.)

5Jn9DOwcaa	In an advanced world and many of those people in this world are overrweight, there actually //are// "magic pills"...like Acai Berry and stuff but I recommend you don't use that stuff. It's obviously unhealthy. <br>  If you need some help, I know of this website:<br>  www.caloriecount.com<br>  I go on it every now and then and it's helpful. <br>  <br>  You see, everyone's body is different. Some people lose weight quickly, other don't. Weight loss also depends on your metabolism. Know what that it? Well, if you don't, it's something in your body that burns all the calories you eat. Some bodies burn calories really fast, some burn rather slowly. When you consume many calories, your metabolism speeds up and burns more calories! Which comes to a conlusion:<br>  Low Calorie diets DON'T work. <br>  In addition to 3 main meals, have some snacks inbetween to boost your metabolism so that you will keep burning calories throughout the entire day.<br>  <br>  You need to have a moderation of everything everyday.Yes, even chocolate. :) There are no "bad" foods--that's something important you neeed to get in your head. You should have no less that 1200 calories per day....if you go to that website I reccomended, there are all kinds of tools that tell you how many calories you should consume per day and how many (approx.) burn. <br>  Here's a fact: 90% of weight loss depends on diet, 10% depends on how much you excersise.<br>  Look up on trustfull sites and in books what types of foods should you eat (once again, caloriecount.com will probably help you with that)<br>  --Ok, so you got the whole nutrition thing, right?<br>  Now it's time for excersise.<br>  To get to a point of weight loss, you need to do 3-4 cardio workouts per week, each one being about 20-30 minutes long. Heard of cardio? Cardio workouts are any activity that gets your heart really pumping. Running, jogging, swimming, dancing, jumproping and more. <br>  <br>  That's all the basics, you can research more on the web/in books. <br>  It will take time before you lose weight, losing more than 2 pounds a week is unhealthy, so don't crazy with weightloss. And remember to eat ;) we don't want you going anorexic or something else as horrible.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps...and sorry it was so long :D<br>  <br>  P.S. If you //do// sign up for calorie count (it's free, by the way), you can look for me as 'bjarmstrong' if you want to ask me any questions or something. Good luck :)|`|k6jYiE2Caa	Go to GYM and burn all your unwanted muscles.

KL1Y5FeHaa	Hey. My hair is like that. It is because the hair is much more thicker there. What I do is to try and trim the hair down a bit and then put some body scrub on that area (body shop scrub is great) and try and flatten out that area as much as possible with your other hand, this will make it easier to glide the blade over. Try and start right at the top and work your way downwards, so you are only doing the hairs that you can really see well first and only doing a small section at a time. Or. You could try the NADS hair in shower hair removal, they have a new one for private areas. I have never tried it but I heard it is very effective.|`|4UQegWk0aa	You need to use more product to make it easier. Either more shaving creme or shaving oil can work too.<br>  <br>  EDIT - In response to your second query, the shaving oil is used instead of shaving creme and it makes the razor glide easier, and conditions the skin at the same time. I don't know if it will work, but it is worth a try, right? You can buy it at chemists and supermarkets.|`|H93JbQS0aa	Please use wax i have used it for long time and its brilliant!! it brings hair back less and small and very soft, and it takes longer than shaving any day!<br>   Good luck!|`|cr2KKT6Naa	landing strip. lol..... best to just trim it you dont need to be shaving that. your not a  baby.|`|hObH0vGVaa	I think you might be shaving to close to the skin. <br>  Remember that pubic hair is very coarse and will not comply as well as leg hair. <br>  <br>  Try shaving from the top to the bottom. It won't give you as close a shave and will take you longer but it will also prevent you shaving off the tops of the bumps on your skin (where the hair follicles come out) this will also help prevent ingrown hairs. <br>  <br>  Make sure your razor is sharp and i have also found doing this towards the end of your shower helps as the hairs have had a chance to soften up by then.|`|WVuU8bqwaa	I use hair conditioner to shave down there..

If so, the padding may return with strict adherence to gluten-free diet and a general improvement of your health<br>  <br>  Look at the websites below for help, especially the first, which has a "safe" and a "forbidden" foods list. Some of the other sites sell gluten-free foods. Also, Betty Hagman wrote several gluten-free cook books. Some of the recipes are amazingly good. Most of them are only very good. ; )<br>  <br>  Finally, two general recommendations. First, pick up "Living Gluten-Free For Dummies" by Donna Korn. It will help a lot.

I would probably see a lawyer though because I wouldn't want to leave anything out.|`|MYRm9nMbaa	There are a variety of software titles available to assist with these documents. The laws of which vary from state to state. I personally would not feel comfortable drafting such documents in an on line format, due to the risk of privacy exposure. The software titles can be an excellent resource. They will typically guide you through the process step-by-step. However, you should still consult a qualified attorney to, at least, review and notarize your final documents. Contact your states bar association for a referral if you need one.|`|t8SlZ2gtaa	There are lots of websites that deal with making a will (some are free, some ask for a fee)  I googled will kits and got heaps of information about making a will online.

mdumRghhaa	Ok, the most effective treatment for bipolar are mood stabilisers. The mood stabilisers that are FDA approved are lithium, valproic acid, carbamazepine and lamotrigine. Lithium is the best out of these but also the most toxic - you need regular blood tests to make sure it isn't destroying your body. Valproic acid is very effective (I was on it for a year) but it can give you a tremor in your hands and it is very socially awkward to have your hands shake all the time.<br>  <br>  Some gentler drugs are antipsychotics. Chlorpromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone. Olanzapine is the best in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Some really good drugs are the benzodiazepines - lorazepam, diazepam, temazepam, etc. And these are fantastic at controlling anger and anxiety. HOWEVER they are highly addictive and very risky. Valium is another word for diazepam - how many people have you read about going to rehab for valium addiction?<br>  <br>  In short bipolar is a powerful disorder and therefore needs powerful drugs to treat it - there's no "easy answer." Hope this helps - feel free to email me if you have any further questions.<br>  <br>  Dan|`|AA10834046	This is a problem that needs a professional opinion.

Really, you can probably figure out for yourself which will be the least painful by trying them on and seeing which hurts the least. <br>  <br>  Lots of aloe lotion on that sunburn will help make it feel better quicker, and also make your bra strap rub less.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Try a camisole w/built in bra.

Constipation and straining to go to the loo can cause it too as this can cause anal fissures, small cracks or splits in the anal wall although there can be pain associated with this. If you've been having it for a while I would seek the Doc's advise just to rule out bowel problems like colitis which is inflammation, or stomach problems, as you're quite young I wouldn't worry unduly but get some advise sooner rather than later just to put your mind at rest it can be something as easy as being advised to eating more roughage in your diet.

After you have washed your hair, take a cup of warm water and stir in three tablespoons of vinegar. Apply this to your hair, making sure the solution reaches your itchy scalp, and let is set for a few minutes. Then, rinse your hair as normal.<br>  <br>  The vinegar will help remove residue that's left on your scalp from shampoo, conditioners and hair products. It will also cleanse your scalp and help heal any scratches you've made with your fingernails. This homemade treatment will also restore the natural pH balance to your hair and scalp|`|aMELFGh0aa	I've read online that the best over the counter cure for an itchy scalp is any shampoo that moisturizes. First, I would suggest that you make an appointment with a dermatologist, then I would suggest that you go to a drugstore and get an over the counter shampoo that will heavily moisturize your skin. (You might look for one meant to treat psoriasis.) You really should see a doctor though, because if you have a serious skin problem a doctor can prescribe medicine to help control it. Hope this helps.|`|mkyFiylSaa	try medicated shampoo like vosene|`|AjdaezeTaa	try organic shampoo/soaps..|`|OyBuEpOTaa	You don't mention any flakes on your scalp.

bEVhDE9Raa	yes:)<br>  hey im a veggie:) and infact, contrary to what people think, being a vegetarian is really healthy<br>  so for example, from red meat, you mostly get protien and iron<br>  and from white meats you mostly get protien, iron and zinc.<br>  if youre giving them up, the best veggie sources of protien are: legumes (dried beans), nuts and seeds, dairy, cereals, grains, fruit, vegetables and eggs if youre still eating them.<br>  the best sources of iron are: chick peas, bran flakes, spinich (i know...!!!), black beans (the best), black treacle, muesli, dried figs (hehe) and dried apricots<br>  and zinc: chickpeas, baked beans, pumpkin seeds, muesli, chedder cheese, tahini paste, fruit yogurt and bread.<br>  i have a really restricted diet because im quite fussy but i get most of my nutrients from cereal. i know its unexpected, but some cereal brands add extra vitamins and iron and you can get upto about 80% of your reccommended daily allowance of these nutrients from one bowl!<br>  good luck, being veggie is kind to your stomach and to animals xxx|`|AA11344263	I'm a pesco vegetarian! :)<br>  You can still be healthy when you're a vegetarian.

Anyway, I also suggest that you don't become a full vegetarian, but it is your choice. <br>  For me, I still eat dairy products especially milk because I'm still growing. I also eat yogurt because it helps my digestive system. I try to avoid chocolate and cheese as best as I can. Greens also have tons of vitamins and so does fruits. When you're snacking, it would be awesome if you substitute your normal snacks to fruits. Fruits have valuable nutrition such as fibers, potassium and other valuable vitamins.

This is because the body perceives a period of fasting as an emergency, and so now your body will try to prepare itself for the next emergency.<br>  <br>  I'm no expert on recovering from such a long a fast, but I'd guess that your best path is probably just to gradually increase your intake so as not to shock your system - gently let your body know that things are back to normal... and then keep them normal!<br>  <br>  Consulting a nutritionist would not be a bad idea, either.|`|PFFcjBHEaa	continue not eating...

yuBvxt55aa	Very simple you only have to do a blood test and see a dermatologist. At your age, unless your hormones are very strong, this is not a teenage kind of thing anymore. Some people have acne during their entire life but it can be treated in a way you do not see it. If I read your question I get the feeling that you got to deep in the problem, i mean in your mind. Why do you have a dull haircut? Change it! Glasses can be beautiful and if you really take care for yourself you would have been to a dermatologist already 4 years ago. Good luck, kind regards from the Netherlands|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	My wife is almost 50 and has been having breakouts around her chin area lately that she calls "adult acne". First of all, be sure to keep your hands away from those areas because that will actually make it worse. She says to use a good mild exfoliating scrub and put a small amount of a clay face masque on the broken out area until it dries, then wash off. These things have helped her. If it continues you may need to see a Dermatologist for help. It could be a hormone imbalance, what you eat or other things a Dr can help you with. People of all ages have bouts with breakouts so don't feel so bad.

AA11151166	Even if they are identical down to the DNA, there are external factors that might have an effect here. Yep, there is always a chance that they'll have their periods around the same time seeing as most of those external factors will be the same, but the same day will be a coincidence.  I have identical twin daughters who are not that age yet, but so far they have reached all the various milestones days and weeks apart, including the loss of their first teeth.  <br>  <br>  It does sound like they are getting close to that time though, so it won't be long.|`|AA11569882	Not exactly the same day, they could start just a month apart though, or they could be a whole year apart.

25f9a2c75c4db980c3d9c8f7f8a1383aaa	Yes, epilepsy can have a very negative effect on sleep.  Is your epilepsy well controlled during the day?  There may be some medication issues your doctor will need to work.  I have done sleep studies on several individuals with epilepsy, and have seen seizures during sleep, which do wake the person up and disrupt sleep.  It is also entirely possible you have a sleep disorder separately from the seizures.  Only way to be sure would be to have a sleep study done.  I've done these for five years and can tell you that while they're a bit annoying due to having to sleep with wires taped to you, they're really not that terrible and no part of it hurts.  If things are going on that are preventing you from getting good sleep, it would only benefit you to find out what's going on so that it can be treated appropriately.  Good Luck, and you can email me if you have questions.<br>  <br>  Edit-  Sleep apnea is a breathing disorder while you are sleeping.  Check out the National Sleep Foundation's website (<a href="http://www.sleepfoundation.org/site/c.huIXKjM0IxF/b.2417141/k.27D9/Home_of_the_Sleep_in_America_Poll.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.sleepfoundation.org/site/c.hu...</a> for more thorough info on sleep disorders.  If your father has it, there is a chance you do as well.  One of the risk factors is airway anatomy, and that is one of the things that is decided by genetics.  do you snore?  Feel tired during the day?  Again, hon, a sleep study would answer all of those things.|`|PvAp83TWaa	If you have had epilepsy, then GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR!|`|6BdbwSIlaa	i had the exact feeling from time to time, it was so damn scary for the first time when i was about 16-17 yo, and now  nearly 6 years passed and the problem lingers in my head... i don't think i have epilepsy, as mine [my problem] just happens when i'm asleep and not when i'm awake.... it doesn't matter  what time it is.. it happens when i'm sleep even in 3:00pm ..... it has a very strange and annoying feeling just like you described + i hear voices like a girl whispering my name into my ear and then suddenly i wake up... and the following day i commonly have headaches and feeling tired.... i my self didn't understand the reason of it. in fact as long as it doesn't hurt so much, i'll live with it and some how its interesting for me to feel different from other people...<br>  <br>  oh i was about to forget to say that my brother also has similar experiences....<br>  <br>  in addition : it happens mostly when i'm physically tired of something... like driving too much ore something....<br>  <br>  if you like to communicate further, you can contact me via email. let me know of your experiences if you don't mind....|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	I worked with TWO people that had epilepsy. Both also had sleep disorders. One was an insomniac (couldn't sleep) and I couldn't remember the issue for the other one. Both of their solutions were to sleep in a completely dark room, no lights, no sounds, no clocks or anything tell time. <br>  I don't know if this would be the same for you or not, but yes, it's probably directly related to epilepsy.|`|TxqjBQleaa	It's interesting that you have seen doctors and had tests yet there seems to be no sort of diagnosis. If they genuinely thought you had epilepsy then medication would have been introduced by now. You really need to have a proper chat with your doctor and get them to explain it to you more clearly.<br>  <br>  To find out more about sleep apnoea see this: <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Sleep-apnoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx?url=Pages/what-is-it.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Sleep-apnoe...</a><br>  <br>  But what I find most interesting is that there has been no mention of sleep paralysis. I'm not a doctor but studied neurobiology to degree level and now work in healthcare - and your symptoms sound more like this to me. Have a look at <a href="http://www.spis.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spis.org.uk/</a><br>  <br>  In simple terms, people with sleep paralysis sometimes wake in the night but their body is a bit 'behind' and is still paralysed (this happens while you sleep - it's perfectly normal). You will get a sensation of being awake but being unable to move, no matter how hard you try. The result can be that you eventually thrash around and shout out as your body regains movement. It can be very scary, but is perfectly harmless. It has also been suggested that this is the cause behind most 'alien abduction' stories - people feel they are pinned to their beds and unable to move.<br>  <br>  I've suffered with sleep paralysis for years. It's easier once you realise what it is - when you wake you learn to just chill until you get movement back in your body.<br>  <br>  This isn't a definitive answer and you definitely need to speak to your doctor again - but why not ask them about sleep paralysis too?<br>  <br>  Hope it gets sorted soon...

Veit7Oa2aa	2 lbs a week if you pull it off will be a very healthy way to keep it off but you need to do it properly.<br>  <br>  It is a good start and you are on the right track however you need to eat more calories. The average calorific intake for a woman is 2000 Kcals per day and to be honest to lose weight healthily you need to cut out 500 calories a day. Any more and you will probably go into starvation mode which will actually make your body stock pile what little calories you take in.<br>  <br>  Especially for dinner you need something more substantial, like a chicken breast and veg etc. Plus any bread is pretty bad. Other than that you look like your doing ok, perhaps have soup for lunch instead of another cereal.<br>  <br>  One thing i find that helps too is don't be super strict as you will not keep it up, you have to give yourself small treats now and again (btw SMALL treats not like a whole tub of ice cream lol) but obviously maintain most of your will power.<br>  <br>  Believe you can do it and you will. Keep up the exercise !!!

Most varieties don't contain whole grains, or if they do, it's after the refined stuff. They also contain things like partially hydrogenated oils, corn syrup, HFCS and other artificial stuff. Yet, thanks to a slick marketing campaign, Kellogg's advertises the Special K stuff as healthy. Eh.<br>  <br>  If the soup is canned it will likely be laden with sodium and other preservatives. I would have a nice lean protein like beans or tofu, veggie burger, etc. with the broccoli (frozen and put in hot water long enough to thaw) as a side dish-- more flavor and more nutrients.<br>  <br>  I've looked at All Bran cereal and they also contain things like HFCS that I don't consider healthy. Also, I eat enough fruits, veggies and whole grains that I don't think I need extra bran like that in my life.<br>  <br>  My "diet" is nothing but whole, natural foods. No animal or animal products, but plenty of whole grains, fruits, veggies, beans, etc. No enriched flour, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated oils, hydrogenated oils or anything else that looks fake. <br>  <br>  Somebody said no snacking. I disagree. I do snack. Sure, it's real foods, but I'll do things like have an apple and peanut butter in the afternoon just because it's there. Or before dinner, while it's cooking, I'll have a handful of peanuts or a slice of all-natural whole wheat bread as a snack. Sometimes, I'll have a slice of bread (with Smart Balance light) while my vegetable water is heating, just to have something to nibble. (Or I'll clean the kitchen while the water is heating.) I see nothing wrong with snacking, as long as it's not junk.|`|NPRGIV0daa	YES. this will definitely help! you're are on the right track FOR SURE. sticking to it might be hard, but you can KNOW that this will work. good luck!|`|KAnEq8Laaa	You're not eating nearly enough calories, especially if you intend to exercise 30 minutes every day. What is going to happen, and I hereby offer to lay any money you like on it, is that you will be pleased and amazed in your first couple weeks on the diet because you will lose a few pounds very quickly, and then you will become disheartened and discouraged after that when your metabolism slows down and you stop losing, and possibly start gaining, weight. With the tiny amount of calories you are consuming here, your body is going to react as though it is starving, and will do so more quickly because of the exercise. I recommend a more moderate approach, namely, finding out your BMR, finding out your particular calorie requirements based on your age, height, current weight, activity level, and goals, and sticking with them. I have attached a link to a calculator that has helped me lose 25% of my body weight. Good luck to you.|`|f1lpdiNEaa	I think you should be eating a bit more than that, especially for breakfast. A cereal bar is just full of sugar and has no goodness it in. Swap it for a fibrous cereal like porridge or bran and have some fruit in it or with it or a glass of fresh juice.<br>  <br>  Then for lunch you can try things like salads, homemade vegetable soups, wholemeal sandwiches with a healthy filling and salad. Followed by fruit or low fat yogurt.<br>  <br>  Then for the evenings alternate your meals, cook lean meat/fish with vegetables if you're not vegetarian. You should be able to avoid snacks if you eat 3 or 4 sensible meals during the day.

LLDJI2suaa	Although you can't go back in time to stop what they have done you still have control over your future. If you don't want to go and see anyone about this problem that you have then you need to learn to open up to people once again. Now that you are older people tend to talk to only the ones they know, you have to go out and about and just start conversations with people. Find a good hang out place or two and talk to people. Don't let your past run your life when you can choose to see the good that is out there. You have to learn to take chances and not be shy towards people. Keep a positive attitude and move forward. If you run into someone you don't like, well there are billions of other people out there and they're not all the same.

MYRm9nMbaa	If you are thinking about a Heart Attack (MI), they can be extremely painful. However, if you are thinking about just a slowing respiration and heart rate, I personally did not find it at all painful. It was a bit frightening, as I was aware of what was happening to me. In late 2003, while hospitalized, the doctors treated me for pain with a combination of codeine and demerol, which I am allergic to. They continued to administer these medications even after I told them I was having a reaction. My heart rate dropped and my blood pressure was so low that the BP cuff couldn't even register a reading. I flatlined for 6.8 seconds. I noticed a flurry of activity in the room and actually had a flashback to something from my childhood and was unable to speak or move. But never experienced any pain.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	My Dad said his pain and sadness all went away until they brought him back for the third time.

Some people die in their sleep which seems to me like a peaceful, gentle way to go while others suffer long chronic illnesses which are in themselves painful. I think in many cases letting go of this life may be much less painful than the suffering they are feeling alive. You seem to be describing a possible heart attack & yes that can be painful. I was in a head on car collision & almost died. The pain was terrible but the pain was due to my massive injuries. From what I believe, it would have been a relief to die at that moment, but I'm glad I survived now.

Most of the time some patients do feel pain before the arrest, especially if it is a heart attack. Pain radiates down the jaw and arm and their chest will feel heavy and some have pain.

After the arrest the patient will stop moving. <br>  <br>  I believe the body knows when it is dieing and the good Lord above will put our mind in a state where we won't feel any pain. <br>  <br>  However, patients, who are resuscitated, do experience pain because  defibulation or CPR was preformed and intubation..|`|6BdbwSIlaa	it depends on how you die.... for example : i cut my finger and and my blood runs out and there were no one to help me. the last thing i remember was myself trying squeeze the wounded finger and then just nothing.. i just opened my eyes seeing my brother slapping my face, splashing water and trying to wake me up... now what I'm trying to say is that at that moment my heart wasn't stopped completely it was just pumping more slowly and that means i was alive but there were not really any pain that i can tell ( just coolness ) in fact i was unconscious, so i believe dying in this way is painless, because it happens in less than a second... as i would be dead if my brother wouldn't found me in bathroom... <br>  <br>  i don't have any idea about heart attacks but heard it gets painful moments before attack...|`|VgWJ8yvwaa	A death from heart failure is painless.

But what does this have to do wit diabetes?|`|AA11434633	The correct term is azoospermia and, as has already been intimated, it means that there is a complete absence of sperm in the ejaculate, or a virtual zero sperm count.<br>  <br>  There are no signs and symptoms that you would notice.  It's not like there's a difference in consistency of your semen, or a change of colour, or anything like that.<br>  <br>  The test for azoospermia would be carried out by a fertility clinic, where a sample of your semen would be examined under a microscope.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid there's no home test kit that could reliably give you a diagnosis of azoospermia.

CJvHQl5vaa	Good for you for planning way ahead instead of starting to think about it two weeks before the formal!<br>  <br>  For weight loss, you should work up to 40-60 minutes per day 4-5 times per week of aerobic exercise.  Aerobic exercise is dancing, walking, jogging, elliptical trainer, treadmill, biking, etc.  That will help burn fat and keep your metabolism up.  You don't have to do the 60 minutes all at once.  You could divide it up into 20 minute sections, say one before you start your day, a walk at lunch and a workout in the evening.<br>  <br>  Then, 2-3 times per week you want to do toning exercises that will build muscle.  Pilates, toning videotapes, yoga, working with weights, etc will tone you up.  Try a little bit of everything and see what works for you!<br>  <br>  Finally, address the diet situation.  You have a choice here:  You can do a sensible diet program like Weight Watchers, Sparkpeople.com or South Beach, which both have online resources you can use, or you can just track your calories for a few days to see what you are eating, and then start cutting out on the unhealthy foods.<br>  <br>  Another eating option is going to see a nutritionist.  Your doctor can refer you.  That would be your idea if your health insurance can cover it or you can afford it out of pocket.<br>  <br>  You have plenty of time to take the weight off.  Good luck!|`|jckyPstEaa	If you can swim, then swimming is good for you to reduce weight or may be you can run about 30 minutes in the park, or walk about 1 hour. If you do daily or five days a week.

hLaorsZjaa	Fruit can be seen as a fuel, but for body building you need to raise your protein intake to match your activities.  This can be accomplished cheaply by eating beans and legumes.<br>  <br>  In addition to rehydrating your body after exercise, fruit juices do contain a moderate amount of vitamins and minerals, but you're best eating the whole fruit.  <br>  <br>  All fruits contain fructose (depends on the fruit) which is a natural supply of energy and can be quickly digested and converted by the body to fuel exercise, or to help recovery afterwards.|`|mlPGe8rdaa	it sounds revulting, but im almost certain raw eggs, either the whites, yolks or both dramatically help you with body building.<br>  <br>  probably bananas because they contain carbs, and spinache.<br>  <br>  not entirely sure, although i thought youd be interrested to hear about the eggs, try it, i guess cooking them is ok too.|`|0fygxRHLaa	dingleberry|`|NPMKqJlMaa	there's only one juice that i know will explode ur muscles is the "Juice"<br>  <br>  steroids|`|c2DWd8zHaa	Carrot juice is especially good.

It is full of sugar and it is quite harmful, in huge quantities, to the teeth. It has in fact as much sugar if not more than ordinary soft drinks. In addition the juice without the remainder of the fruit contains no roughage which is beneficial to the bowel for the purpose of remaining regular. So I suppose moderate fruit juice intake is allowed...but to just rely on it's benefits...is foolish
N3t7uv1saa	If the tonsillitis is caused from a streptococcal infection, and it sounds like that is the case because of the white dots, it can indeed, cause valvular heart disease.  The bacteria can "seed" (implant themselves) in the valve leaflets and continue to grow.  This can develop into a "vegetation" like growth and interfere with the function of the valve.  Not in three days, however.  But, if you have recurrent white spots and more pain, see a Dr. soon so that they can kill this nasty bacteria.|`|xwZV9jgPaa	Any infection can lead to worse problems if left untreated. I'd think 3 days tho is a little too soon to start freaking out that it transferred to your heart. Have you been taking a lot of aspirin?

There could be other reasons for the chest pains.|`|PvAp83TWaa	Tonsiitis is usually caused by a streptoccocal infection.<br>  <br>  These strep bacteria can lead to Rheumatoid heart disease.<br>  <br>  You may wanna google it up.

KAnEq8Laaa	The efficacy of the "after 6 diet" or "6 p.m. diet" or however you wish to call it, is debatable. The reason for this is, that you can easily eat say, 5000 calories before noon if you like, and nothing after 6 that day, and you will, naturally, gain weight. That's an exaggerated example, of course, but you get my point. The notion of the 6 o'clock diet is that, since you are obviously not moving very much, if at all, while you are sleeping, that your body hangs on to calories more easily, and thus you gain weight. Therefore, you eat what you like for breakfast and lunch, a tiny dinner, and nothing after 6 p.m. Well, if it is your habit to have a huge dinner, and you cut that out, and do nothing else, odds are, you will lose weight. Likewise, the over-indulgence of calories that I mentioned earlier can be a real bullet to the foot. Add to this that there is a lot of research showing that the metabolism is kept up by having frequent, small meals, every three hours or so, or a total of 5 or 6 small meals a day. Thus, even if your last meal is at 11 o'clock at night, you're keeping your body burning calories, and will lose weight. <br>  <br>  The 6 p.m. diet is something I've heard of, and some former colleagues of mine had tried it, with no success. They also tried the "cabbage soup" diet, which should give you some indication of their powers of discernment. In any case, what has worked for me is getting to know and understand my BMR, my BMI, how many calories my body actually needs, and what is appropriate and sufficient exercise. I have lost over 50 pounds this way, and it wasn't rocket science. I would read up on the pros and cons of any diet you are interested in, and if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Good luck to you.

ems2NJ46aa	this happens to me when i have too much sugar, caffeine or alcohol before i sleep, try cutting down on these and don't have any in the evenings and see if it helps :)  this means cutting out sodas/coke/tea/coffee/red bull (or other caffinated drinks)/alcohol/junk food/sugary snacks - all of these things will put your body on edge and stop you sleeping.  cut them out for a while and see if it helps, it seriously effects my sleep if i have too much of this stuff, i can't stop thinking, my mind wont close down properly and i wake up more tired than when i went to bed.  <br>  <br>  instead have something like a banana before you sleep - it contains tryptophan which will help you sleep and will also give your blood sugars a boost. you could also try a snack like peanut butter (with low sugar) on wholemeal bread before you sleep, or as a midnight snack if you're findind it hard to sleep.|`|9YM0whxLaa	you need to go to a phycologist and see if they can perscibe you some depression meds<br>  thats how my fiance was feeeling before he went on his meds<br>  it may not work right away...<br>  but it will<br>  <br>  dont give up <br>  things will get wayy betterrrr!!!!!<br>  =]|`|c89d6971b68010f6683d6e2b1920cc43aa	you could be depressed. you should go to your local mental health facility to be checked out. you could just be under a lot of stress right now|`|s2jyGuJ4aa	You have just rebounded from a period in your life that has beseiged you: puberty.

YX93lq4daa	Be safe and stay away from all chemicals mostly found in personal care products. I have always gotten red blotched, itchy, and irritated skin. About 3 years ago it started getting worse. It was at that time I decided to switch over to all organic products. I have had very good luck. I use castile soap for body wash. A castile soap base with some herbs for a foaming face wash. I have found that flower water works great for a toner. ACV, pure witch hazel, and herbs also work well. I use a french green clay for a face mask. As a moisturizer I use emu oil mixed with herbs. For the body if needed I use coconut oil or raw shea butter. It is also pretty easy to make your own toothpaste. The products I get are high quality but cheap. Since you only have to use a small amount, I save a lot of money.<br>  <br>  *If you are looking to stay away from those chemicals or all chemicals in general, you need to read the label of everything you buy.

Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first - main anxiety post] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|s2jyGuJ4aa	You are not experiencing panic attacks, you are experiencing anxiety---possibly an anxiety disorder.

I have a three year old daughter who has to take a lot of meds due to lung issues, and some days it can be next to impossible to get all of it in her!<br>  <br>  I could be wrong, but I don't think Zantac comes in chewables.  It does come in liquid form (tastes pretty bad), and I think it also comes in granules that can be dissolved in water.  We actually switched my daughter to Prevacid Solutabs at about 12 months, and these work great, probably even better than than the Zantac only without all the drama.  At only 3, she can't swallow pills yet, so we dissolve them in a drink of her choice.  They must not be too bad because when it is getting close to time to take it, she often reminds me, "Mommy, belly hurts, need my meds please."<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Have you done your research there too? Seeing if there is enough market to sustain you? Esp. a market whose consumers may be spending a ton of money on drugs?

I strongly suggest consulting small business people in your area.<br>  <br>  If you go ahead, I'm not sure you can or should "disguise" it. But I'd think locating it in a small building with other medical related services would give it a balance of "camouflage" in that it wouldn't have a sign at the front screaming "AIDS", yet having people enter and leave the building who may be at various stages of illness wouldn't look that unusual.<br>  <br>  As I said, I'm not sure it's a strong business idea, though socially, it sounds pretty good.

Some people can be asymptomatic for a life time.  Which means you could have caught it many many years before you ever met your boyfriend and it is in your system.  It is obviously in its latent period.  The latent period can last a lifetime.  If this is the case, you need to watch having kids.  It can be passed to newborn babies.

78c8fa42f10a6b4d6fa9d689c34f530daa	Sunburn and heat stroke are two health risks from hot, sunny days.  <br>  <br>  SUNBURN:  It is best to avoid sunburn by staying out of the sun.  The sun's rays damage the skin, over time causing changes that are commonly attributed to old age, such as wrinkling, sagging, and brown spots.  The incidence of skin cancer is also directly related to the amount of sun and sunburn a person has had in their lifetime.  Wearing sunscreen is not entirely effective in preventing these changes.  For that reason, a person who needs to be in the sun ought to stay covered up as much as possible.  Wear hats and loose fabrics that breathe and allow air circulation yet block the sun.  The best sunscreens to use are those containing chemicals that actually create a barrier to the sun's rays, such as zinc oxide.  <br>  <br>  A sunburn is a first degree burn and should be treated with the same first aid that one would give to a first degree burn.  For some reason, the fresh juice from the leaf of an aloe plant is soothing and helps heal the burn.  Soothing lotions can help with moisturizing the damaged skin.  A sunburn also damages the skin's ability to protect the body, so a person with a severe sunburn will notice that he feels hot or cold more easily.  <br>  <br>  As it first tries to heal itself, the body will send extra blood and defenses to the damaged skin, giving it a red appearance.  The skin itself will be painful, but the inflammation also contributes to discomfort.  Oral anti-inflammatories such as aspirin or ibuprofen will help with the inflammation.  A person with severe sunburn should also drink lots of fluid because the skin will dehydrate much more easily.    <br>  <br>  The main issue is to stabilize the skin, keep the body from getting too cold or hot, and then to protect the skin while it heals.  It will take a few weeks for the skin underneath to grow and the dead (sunburned) skin will eventually peel off.  As it is peeling, the old skin will feel itchy but it should not be scratched as it does serve to protect the new skin growing underneath.  If a sunburn is severe enough to cause blistering, a physician or nurse should be consulted both for the short term and to reduce the changes of scarring later.  <br>  <br>  HEAT STROKE: Heat stroke also results when a person is outside in the sun for too long.  When a person who is out in the sun begins to feel a bit weak and perhaps nauseous, this is likely to be heat exhaustion.  Mere "heat exhaustion" turns into "heat stroke" when the body's internal engine goes out of control.  What starts out as a bit of overheating turns into a cycle where the body gets hotter and hotter.  The person can actually die if not treated.  <br>  <br>  To avoid heat exhaustion and heat stroke, it is very important that a person in a hot environment drink lots of fluid.  Headache, thirst, feeling weak or tired are all danger signs that should be heeded; get out of the sun and drink lots of fluid to give the body what it needs to keep its temperature regulated.  <br>  <br>  Sun exposure is another contributing factor to heat stroke.  The sun is a source of heat, and also sunburn damages the skin's ability to regulate body temperature.  A person in danger of heat stroke must be moved out of the sun and away from the source of heat.  There is a good reason that people in hot climates usually have a tradition of afternoon siestas or of having quiet time in the shade during the "heat of the day".  <br>  <br>  Many people do not realize that headache is a sign of heat exhaustion.  At the first sign of headache during hot weather, a person should respond by asking themselves, "have I drunk enough lately?" <br>  Thirst is not a reliable indicator at all of whether a person is drinking enough fluid.  If a person is not peeing every two hours, then they are not drinking enough fluid.  Another danger sign is if a person stops sweating.  This means their body is not getting enough fluid and that the body is trying to conserve fluid by stopping the flow of sweat.  On a very hot day in a very hot climate, a person ought to think in terms of drinking at least a gallon of water during the course of a full day.  Many people from northern climates are not used to this, do not realize that thirst is not a reliable indicator of fluid needs, and get heat stroke.  <br>  <br>  Once a person's body temperature regulating mechanism is out of order, it will not necessarily correct itself.  Imagine that it's as if the internal fire begins to rage out of control all on its own.  The person's body temperature will continue to rise because the body has lost the resources to bring it back down to normal (a person with heat stroke will feel hot to the touch and may appear flushed in their skin).  <br>  <br>  Heat stroke is a medical emergency and can result in death, so the person should be carried to a hospital if possible.  In the meantime, for mild cases, first aid for heat stroke involves physically cooling the body by external means.  The person will not "feel" like drinking but they should dr

If you eat any very cold or hot food afterwards, it might cause the medicine to react differently in your body and not work to full effect or something of the like.

3ccD7M04aa	My husband tried the standard techniques: keggel exercises, meditation, masturbating right before, but he just found them boring to do and ineffective (maybe because he got bored and gave up before seeing results).<br>  This Worked for my husband:<br>  buy yourself a realistic vagina (I recommend the Mimi at www.Passion8Girls.com->online shopping->just for him), lube it up and you'll have a much more intense experience than using your hand. This will allow you to practice your control and get used to the feeling of a vagina without embarrassing yourself. Don't worry, you'll overcome it (sorry, no pun intended it). You can also try desensitizing cream or lotion like Stay Hard (it's also in the just for him section)... it's even flavored strawberry.<br>  Hope that helps. :)|`|ddf97263e4bac13f02a3db67a26b8d53aa	squeze|`|6TSwoU3yaa	The safest answer is already given in a couple of the responses.  Masturbate an hour or so before you intend to have sex.  This will take the edge off your sexual need and allow you to concentrate properly on your partner when you are having sex.  <br>  <br>  Sex, by the way, is not self-gratification.  It is a mutual sharing of respect and honour.|`|cAy1SI9vaa	Psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, guilt, depression, low self-esteem, and fear of sexual failure cause are the major factors of such type of problem.

The trick is for you or your partner to apply light pressure just below the head of the penis for about 20 seconds and then let go. Once the urge to ejaculate has passed, you can go on having sex, repeating this technique as necessary. If you get this technique down right you can eventually learn to delay ejaculation with the squeeze and even to gain a sort of control over ejaculation without it. However, the squeeze requires the cooperation of both partners. Also, premature ejaculation often returns, and additional therapy may be needed.|`|aAcjC22gaa	Some studies suggest the holding technique can be dangerous so I would'nt really play with that.

AA11492002	you know she may be anemic and be iron deficient... do you serve lots of greens? Greens (not salad) like collard greens. a telltale sign this is anemia is she get headaches or light headed the week before her period. <br>  <br>  If she is vegetarian she needs vitamin and iron supplements, that would solve the light headed issue. seeing specks of green light is a mystery...  I would get a referral to an ophthalmologist (an eye doctor) not an optometrist (the glasses dude)... and get a dye test to make sure there are no serious issues with her eyes.

YcO46wKTaa	This could be asthma in which case you need to go to the doctor. Asthma can be triggered by different things. Next time this happens, try to breathe out, but not too far or you will be in trouble, if when you breathe out deep you wheeze, then this is asthma. What is happening is your lungs are filled with mucus and its not that you cant breathe in its that you cant breathe out, so your lungs arent emptying so when you try to breathe in there is no space for any air and it feels like your lungs just wont expend and there is something blocking you from breathing. Try this and if this sounds familiar then go to A & E. immediately! asthma can be a killer and you may be having an attack.|`|G23PtaZRaa	No I don't believe its an anxiety attack because this happens to me often and I have also had an anxiety attack before and they were different.

Anti depressants can reduce your seizure threshold but any other mood stabilizer should actually treat your epilepsy. Ask him About Lamictal (lamotragine). Also a benzo would not increase your seizures either and would go a long way towards helping the panic and anxiety......... Maybe the Seroquel is just not the drug for you (it was horrible for me, I got really depressed and just wanted to sleep all day). Do talk to your doc about trying something else. If he reallyl says EVERYTHING else would be bad for your epilepsy he is full of crap.

cku5S9WLaa	Okay. Go and volunteer. You will not get paid but you will get tons of experience and it will show your potential employer how much you love to work. You can say you have depression but you are working through it by keeping yourself busy. And you can sign up to a lot of temp agencies as well. They will help find a temporary job for you while you look for something more permanant.|`|UVdviQMPaa	Mental health is not a subject to discuss with an employer. You know you are limited so start small and let it grow .If you are on welfare then do volunteer work at first. Let those kind of people direct you to a part time job. Continue more education and try to keep plans organized. Your day needs to be on paper . Check the list twice a day. Some days I need a list of to do just to motivate myself. I know the  better chances will come your way .|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You will need an answer for your gaps in employment, but do not give bouts of depression as the reason. You have no obligation to divulge private areas of your life. This will be the first time I've  advised people not to tell the truth but in your case I think it will be necessary. There are a variety of reasons you could give that would be perfectly acceptable in an interview...........your mother has a chronic disease and often needs someone to stay with her so you would have to leave your job to be her caretaker, you received a small inheritance so you decided to travel and only work when the inheritance money was getting low now you're tired of traveling and all the money has been spent so you're ready to work full time, you were sick (with some disease which is curable) so they won't think you'll always be out sick, you lived with a gf who was very well off and there was no need for you to work..you get the idea. You will find that working will boost your self esteem, help you to not dwell on the depression and give you pride in yourself. Not to mention your financial situation. The best of luck to you.|`|8e996db3a0184f500d484a653afc7569aa	You sound quite motivated to me? And it looks like you really want to get back into work.<br>  <br>  Why don't you apply for part time work to start with. Once you're back into the swing of things you could look at increasing hours or going for a full time job.<br>  <br>  I think the trick is to be honest about your medical past  The employers who knock you back are probably the ones to avoid anyway but in my experience, an honest upfront person at interview is a rare occurrence, and a good sign of a top employee.<br>  <br>  All the best N, and good luck.|`|ROWSzTknaa	I'm in the same position as you. Huge gaps in my resume because of my mental health problems. Try doing a resume with your work experience without the dates. During an interview explain that in your past you had to take some personal time but now your excited to return to the workforce or even explain it in your cover letter if you feel you may be nervous discussing it in person. Think positive! Focus on what you can offer this employer. Review your skills and go to the interview with a positive attitude.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	sounds familiar..  i went to see my psychologist last week and i'm 28.. and she asked me my previous work history...  i rattled of a shameful amount...  i work part time now.. and have for the past 5 years .. and i also get part pension..  because i have severe anxiety disorder..   but she still made me feel like crap...  u could always tell a smalllll little white lie and tell them u were looking after a sick relative or something..  and doing a course or something might help.. good luck

I eat when I'm bored too. My question for you is that do you really throw up afterwards, or do you just get the sensation to, but never actually threw up.

But overall I would just to see a doctor either way just in case.|`|sRlqwm0Jaa	Yeah this happens to me too. Especially if you eat right before you go to bed.  You probably eat too fast and when you lie down your stomach is trying to digest the food you've eaten.. but it's hard to either because you didn't chew it well enough or you've just eaten too much. and plus when you lie down it's difficult for your stomach to digest it well.<br>  <br>  So try not to eat two hours before you go to bed. it's hard on the stomach!|`|JVzwHwx6aa	NO its not normal.you have to eat just three meals aday so this is a really good diet that helped me alot.The diet it cann't get easier than these: you have a list of aliments from witch you can chose for breakfast and lunch, as well as same choices and solutions for dinner; also you have a list with banned aliments. You are not allowed to eat sweets, salt, popcorn, biscuits or other aliments that you eat when you are getting bored. <br>  <br>  <br>  Breakfast choices<br>     Make sure you have breakfast every day. Drink a cup of coffee or tea (black tea, green tea or medicinal plants tea). Chose only one fruit from each list, only one protein aliment and one with carbohydrates. You can mix them freely; very important is to not eat more then one.<br>  <br>  Fruits: (chose one from the list): <br>  1 banana; <br>  1 apple; <br>  1 grapefruit; <br>  2 kiwi fruits; <br>  80 g of pineapple; <br>  80 g of strawberries, raspberries; <br>  Proteins: <br>  2 spoons of simple yogurt, without fat; <br>  A mug of milk; <br>  A boiled egg; <br>  3 slices of bacon; <br>  85 g of tuna; <br>  75 g of white cheese; <br>  40 g of peanuts without salt; <br>  Carbohydrates: <br>  1 slice of bread; <br>  5 spoons of muesli, without sugar; <br>  2 biscuits; <br>  5 spoons of cereals with fruits without sugar; <br>  Lunch:<br>     Just as breakfast, but this time you can choose two aliments from the fruits and vegetables list, one from protein list and one from carbohydrates list. Try to combine them as different as you can.<br>  <br>  Fruits and vegetables: 80 g of carrots, cabbage, broccoli, tomatoes, spinach, grapes, pineapple, apple, orange. Proteins (just one) <br>  100 g of fish (mackerel, salmon, crap); <br>  100 g of red meat; <br>  150 g of chicken; <br>  1 big egg; <br>  100 g of cheese without fat; <br>  Carbohydrates: <br>  100 g of spaghetti; <br>  1 big potato; <br>  2 slices of bread; <br>  125 g of boiled been or soybean; <br>  Dinner:<br>     You can eat 3 portions of fruits or vegetables listed. From proteins, you can eat only one aliment cooked at the grill or microwave and one from carbohydrate list. You are not allowed to use oil or sauce. Drink as much water is possible and take long walks. You are not allowed:<br>  <br>     Sugar - represent an important risk factor. After few days without sweets, you will no longer feel the need to eat them. Don't putt sugar or honey in your coffee or tea, and never touch the chocolate.<br>  <br>     Alcohol represents calories that you don't need.<br>  <br>     Salt - maintains water in the tissues, so try to avoid it at list one week. Also salt is not good for your hart or kidneys.
ZRxdTn2Laa	I've never had a baby tooth pulled. But they don't have roots, and the roots are what make the extraction of teeth painful.

dpgXzMenaa	I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|7iIh5QmOaa	same thing masterbate and masterbating are same thing. and yes girls masterbate too. everyone does. it natural. who ever told you girls dont lied. we all go through that stage and some use different terms. but either way you say it, it all means the same thing honey.|`|JCELn3Lpaa	Of course the can! In fact women have more intense orgasm for longer than men can. Just get experimental with your shower head.|`|ltGDSbYEaa	you just have to rub your clit on get juices from your vagina to keep it wet an if you have a got to pee feeling keep it up your just going to squirt|`|d774Gd1jaa	who ever told you that lied!!!

cmhDgruqaa	last year i ripped off all of my nail and it bled and it will stop just rap it up and it will get better it took 3 months for mine to grow back|`|ssZM1me6aa	You need to apply pressure to it for about 30 sec.(Yes it may hurt a little) but this helps stop the bleeding...If It keeps bleeding then i suggest you go to the E.R.(emergency room)|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	Have you tried to keep firm pressure on it for the whole 30 mins?<br>  If after 30 mins of firm pressure, it still bleeds, then yes, go to urgent care.<br>  <br>  To apply firm pressure, I would wrap the finger with many tight layer off paper towel. Make it thick and somewhat tight. Then wrap this with any kind of tape, tightly (not enough to cut off your finger's circulation).<br>  If it bleeds through this, go to the urgent care.|`|yQl4fiJAaa	i would suggest the hospital yea
3ctL64O4aa	Meals will be off putting because you were making them so small before so your stomach will be used to this.<br>  <br>  Coley x|`|KWwW7N49aa	I am on a fat-free kind of diet but I don't deny myself.  I find it very easy to prepare wholesome meals.  Eat lots of brown and black bread (fiber), lots of fruits and veggies.  Last night I prepared a skinless chicken breast, stir-fried with green peppers, onions and mushrooms. I added brown rice and used a stir-fry mix.  Turned out good.  Also you can buy squash and zucchini along with diced tomatoes, add onions and put a little cheddar cheese or Parmesan and pop that baby in the oven for a nice veggie casserole.  Cut up some potatoes and use olive oil on them and put in the oven. For lunch make a nice tuna fish sandwich with lettuce and tomato and wheat or multi-grain bread with your soup.  You just need to spice it up a bit.  Oh and I have dessert.  Try the Mango or Peach sorbets.  Ummm so good. Again you are counting calories but I am counting fat and they both keep the weight off.  Don't forget your 30-minute walk each day. Good luck.
xmibEEdcaa	You're having anxiety attacks. Lots of people think they're having a heart attack when they first experience one. An anxiety attack can be a very scary experience.<br>  <br>  I'd ask your parents to make you a doctor's appointment. Just "willing yourself to relax" is unlikely to stop the problem once you're having full-blown anxiety attacks. Your brain can get into a kind of a rut where it continues to make your body react as if you're in real physical danger, no matter how much you know consciously that this isn't the case. Once it becomes a pattern, it's unlikely that you'll be able to just wish it away.<br>  <br>  If you were an adult, I'd advise that you talk to a doctor about going on an anti-anxiety medication for a little while, but I don't know if those medications are a good idea for someone your age. Your doctor would know that better than I would. Talking to someone like a therapist or a counsellor to try to determine where that anxiety came from in the first place might also help you to convince your body that it really doesn't need to react so strongly in certain situations.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Anxiety attacks....happen around your age. Social and emotional stress would trigger it. Relax and have fun at this time in your life..but remember, don't take it too serious, it's not permanent.

There is no cure, but it can be controlled. At your age, you'll never grow out of it, but its called eczema. (pronounced eggs-zee-ma). It is extremely itchy, especially when it first develops, but you need to talk to your doctor so they can recommend a topical skin cream to control it. It's really not as bad as it sounds. AND DON'T TRUST MY JUDGEMENT-SEE YOUR DERMATOLOGIST.
KUVRekuZaa	While I agree with others that you should arrange to see a doctor, or at least ( if in the U.K.) get advice from NHS direct immediate pain relief:<br>  <br>  Hot water bottle wrapped in a t-shirt held against the ear is very comforting.<br>  <br>  Take Iburophen 2 x 200mg - take paracetamol as well 2 X 200 mg but tale these 2 hours after the Ibuprophen. Then after 4 hours more Ibuprofen, after 6 hours more paracetomol etc ......<br>  <br>  I am not convinced of the wisdom of putting oil, or anything else in the ear unless the doctor says so.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	lie in a hot bath and let the water flow into your ear, take two paracetamol and two ibuprofen with hot lemonade|`|7NDg1wjQaa	Take a wet Q tip and rub it to see if its just the wax that's building up and then go see a doctor to find out if you should get some kind of ear drops for it.|`|4bH6L9JSaa	Right, now when you do this it feels reeeeeeeeally weird.<br>  but put a couple of drops of oil in your ear and lay on ur side. this will wash out the wax from your ear. then do the other ear.<br>  <br>  you should feel better after. it doesn't hurt one bit, it just feels weird.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	Go to the doctor!!  You can end up with hearing loss if your ear infection gets bad enough!
yKE9lU00aa	That sounds great, I guess you must be in your prime time (30-35) I hope you are enjoying it though not just doing it to do it? If you climax you will feel relaxed and probably won't want to continue right away, joining in with your partner's rest time too, thus  enjoying it. If you don't climax then yeah you should have all the energy in the world to go on (if you like your partner a lot that is).  I suppose you just trying to climax too.|`|mCXXoMO8aa	thats simple, he is doing all the work.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	all guys are like that. they exert alot of energy during sex, more so than women. So typically a guys passes out and the woman is awake and hyper. It happens ot my husband and I all the time|`|4uike3ARaa	Maybe because you're wearing the poor guy out? <br>  Is he doing most of the 'work,' so to speak? That could also explain it.<br>  I never thought that I would say it, but I once had a lover who was so, er, insatiable, that I remember saying, "What? AGAIN??? You've got to be kidding."<br>  She wasn't.
cHErAjV7aa	No
D165sgXJaa	I will put some references in but want to pass on what worked for me.  I had hives/urticaria for 10 years triggered by cold, pressure, vibration.  They went away when I went on a gluten free diet.  Gluten is found in wheat, rye and barley products.  Maybe 10 percent of urticaria cases are caused by this.  First get tested for celiac disease with a blood test by your doctor before you go on a trial gluten free diet.  IF that is negative, try a gluten free diet for 2-3 months to see if you have nonceliac gluten intolerance or an allergy to gluten or wheat.  <br>  <br>  A good way to do a trial is to eat fresh fruit and vegetables, non processed meats, cheese, eggs.  Stay away from commercial sauces and gravies.  Add in potatoes and rice for starches.  If that works then you can learn more about coping with a gluten free diet and reading labels and proceed.  My hives ended about 6 weeks into a gluten free diet.<br>  <br>  If I can you anymore, contact me through here. -- Good luck!!

tDxNQYb7aa	Get all 4 done with at once.  I got it done last year when I was 14 and I will say that it sucks.  I didn't vomit or anything but I felt like crap for the first 4 days.  Your mouth swells and it does hurt a lot unless you take the percocet or vicodin or whatever the doctor prescribes.  I know those have been known to cause vomiting.  It is a fairly painful process and you can hardly eat anything for the first 4 days.  It would just be torture to have to deal with it twice.  Get it all done and you will be glad its over.|`|O71xlcG3aa	No do it in one!  You don't want to have to go through that twice!  Just follow the doctors orders and you won't get sick.

pUpUkX14aa	Protein per se won't give you muscle size and growth without working out.  Whey protein has been recognized as one of the best for taking after a workout.  <br>  <br>  Casein protein found in milk products is also good source of protein but you shouldn't take it after a workout. Egg whites are an excellent source of protein also.<br>  <br>  The thing you should remember is that if you are working out you need to be taking in enough protein to sustain muscle growth.  I can't answer how much you need without a lot more information.  If you are working out hard several days a week then just multiply your weight by 2 and take that many grams in protein a day.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	I use Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard I heard it's good and I have no complaints.

mINKANlAaa	i think you should go to a doctor and get yourself checked out. better safe than sorry is what i always say..
AA10350894	No, because you are intelligent enough to be able to resist the urge to drink, aren't you?|`|Mm4U4VpBaa	No your fine. Alcoholics can't imagine going a day without a drink and drink all the time haha
q7z7Ni3Daa	Smoking can cause leg pains because it affects the circulation of your blood. It makes the blood vessels smaller, which is why many smokers actually die of heart disease rather than cancer.
mdV0oXATaa	Not entirely, alcohol goes into your blood, <br>  <br>  To cleanse your system and filter your blood, your kidneys must work extra hard and thus need more water to flush out the body. If you dont drink, you could risk the chance of gout or kidney stones becuase of the build up of uric acid<br>  <br>  This is why alcholics have a higher chance of kidney and liver disease.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	You need to drink equal amounts of water to alcohol.|`|AA10563860	No.  it is said that alcohol stimulates your kidneys to produce urine.<br>  Yes, you should drink water during or after your drink in excess.|`|h2CuFTRfaa	after drinking alcohol turns into sugar in your blood stream.|`|JWNzoksmaa	dehydration is the word you're looking for....and yes alcohol dehydrates you.|`|AEJFCUOOaa	yes this is right|`|ebcW0plBaa	No ,<br>  after u drink alcohol ur brain stop making sucrous  that y u drunk.
ULTRJJ6waa	Hi. Yes this is normal. Thyroid problems cause irregular periods, especially if your thyroid levels are not right. A simple blood test will tell you if your levels are off. I'd let the doctor know what's going on, just to be safe.

qlar3cVMaa	The larger side of average (34C is the average), but it's really a proportion thing. You see these tiny, 20-inch waisted girls always talking about their set of Ds, and yes, they look painfully large, but someone who is a 36 may be a perfect fit. Put simply, cup size is a letter in the alphabet in correlation with the measurement of the biggest part of the breast minus that of  under the arms (For example, if you're 36 inches around the armpits, and 40 on the boobies, making a four-inch difference, you'd be a 36 D, just as someone who is 28 under the arms and 32 up there would be a D28)|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Depends on age, weight and height. Its probably biggish, but actually around the average size if you take all women into account.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	They are big.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	it all depends on your body. i mean if you are short and petite then they might look big on you, but if you are tall and curvy then they might be normal for your body.|`|PDYiwb3Raa	It's big because AA is the smallest ( known ) cup size. And as you go down the alphabet the sizes get bigger with the letter.|`|e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	You would need a microscope to see them, obviously ;o)<br>  <br>  No - that's big of course... wonder what went through your mind when you posted that question!|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	quite big but a chubby lady too|`|v30TPwUtaa	...I hate you so much.<br>  You think 36D is small?<br>  I'm an effin 28A!

Generally you would need to be more aware of what you are doing and take notice your behavior when you start your bad habit, then the next time you can recognise it before it happens and put a stop to it.  Breaking the habit may require a bit of time since it has been part of your patterns for years, so have patience.  good luck!|`|dgm1UTadaa	Some suggestions:<br>  -Write 200 pleasurable reasons why you want to get rid of the habit.<br>  -Find some subliminal CDs that you can listen to ( I kick my smoking habit years ago by listening to such CDs).<br>  -Write down what will it cause you if you do not change ( the pain).|`|43Mti3Sbaa	This will seem weird, but they have a thing called whipping therapy, and it helps stop every addiction, or habit you could possibly think of.

O8h39Se2aa	Using nasal spray won't clear up a runny nose. Nasal sprays clear up infections, such as sinus infections, which CAUSE the running nose, but won't necessarily make it go away. Blow your nose often and get some fresh air to breath in new and clean air that can help the stuffiness.|`|Z5ereta1aa	ugh i have the same problem during the winter!<br>  <br>  ask your doctor for Nasonex.

5jf5tcMnaa	Most likely, once the bacteria got to the nerve, the pulp would die and the tooth would abscess.  that is pus would collect at the tip of the roots, because it is acidic, it eats away at the bone at the tip of the tooth.  This causes swelling and pain.  <br>  Most likely it would eat through the bone plate of the jaw, and cause your gums to swell up into what people like to call a gum boil.  <br>  It could also track another way, ending up causing a swelling in your throat that could compromise your breathing, or it could go to your brain.  This would obviously not be good for ya!

8asG4WCwaa	What kind of doctor? What tests did the doctor actually have done? DIfferent tests look at different potential causes. <br>  <br>  Average blood sugar level over a 90 period shows on an A1c.  Reactive hypoglycemia to sugary foods would show on a glucose tolerance test.  Hyperinsulinemia, or too much insulin (which would cause low blood sugar) would show (I believe) on a C-peptide test.  Hypoglucagonaemia, too little glucoagon (which could cause some cases of low blood sugar) would show on whatever test that is (can't think of it right now). TSH and/or T3/T4 would show thyroid problems (certainly hyperthyroidism could account for some cases of low blood sugar).  Even digestive problems of various kinds could account for difficulties getting adequate glucose and other nutrients from food.<br>  <br>  You should discuss your concerns with the doctor, or get a second or third opinion (like with a specialist if the first doctor is a general practitioner or pediatrician).  Try an endocrinologist.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	It is the cookies and candy that are causing your low sugar problems.<br>  <br>  My sis is Hypo, also a school bus driver. She goes to bed in 30 minutes with migraine if she has any desserts at all. She never eats Carbohydrate rich foods any more prefering to remain sane with a near normal glucose level.<br>  <br>  The sugars you ate caused you to go to a normal level then crash hard faster than most people do.<br>  <br>  Try livin the low carb way! No breads, pastas, cereals, rices, etc, also no starchy root veggies, soft sweet fruits, very little milk product. Eat mostly protein rich foods and green leafy salad stuffs for a few weeks and I think you will feel much better.
dRvL6iNaaa	honestly speaking you shouldn't be depressed and no teen helplines for you,coz u don't need 'em ok.The only person who can help you is u yourself. don't change yourself and just because ur sister has more friends then you, doesn't mean that ur not better than her, there are many things you r better at for wich your sister envies you. and plz dont cut yourself  u probably  are a beautiful girl with a very beautiful personality cutting youself will only give you scars and nothing else other than blood, but thats a different thing. the bottom line is you need to change your social cirlce to people who are right for you. and i got to agree with what the other guyz said that high school drama is nothing to worry about.|`|1oBilGHuaa	Please make an appointment to speak to the guidance counselor at your school.

You could try that - just phone up and make an appointment - but I don't really know how the medical system works in America (assuming you're american) so you maybe have to pay or something? Idk.

You could do damage and what if you cut one good time and cant stop the bleeding?<br>  ~If you are depressed like that, you should consult your school guidance counselor, or even a mentor in the school if you can not talk to your family. Things like this should not be handled alone. That sounds like part of your depression, lonely feeling. The bf thing, oh well, yes it hurts, but boys are like buses... you miss one, there will be another one coming. <br>  ~Friends will come and go. At your age me and my friends you could not pry us apart, but Im 24 now, and dont talk to any of them now. We went different ways.<br>  ~My step sisters are twins, and I felt just like you. They did everything better... or so I thought. They had the spotlight, and I was the "bad" child. As we got older, I saw they just had different ways than me, and I was better at certain things. So what your sister is "better" at Im sure you are even "better" in something else. Pick up a hobby that will give you the spotlight more. Become more outgoing. Dont change who you are, but things you do. Try to speak up around friends, offer things to do on a weekend or something. Just be yourself, and sooner or later things will get better. I promise.|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	i have the same issue only i'm a freshman<br>  <br>  i experience a lot of drama with my friends and the guy i like... my friends HATE him but we like each other so much... so i'm caught in the middle there. I am in a group of friends and i go to an all girls school which causes much more drama. <br>  <br>  for me, cutting myself was something i just did as a habit. i told people it was a cry for help but my cousin brought it up "if you were cutting yourself as a cry for help, why do you hide it?" I aslo had a drug problem and would take a lot of pills... a lot of caffeine pills, sometimes tylenol or advil, and cocaine (it ate my wallet). <br>  <br>  I did feel i had a lot of issues with my parents... my father was very abusive and my mother had enough stress with my father. With all the tension  between them, they never had the time for me. they were cranky when i talkked to them but when i opened up to my mother when she was alone, everything changed. Now that my father is out of the picture, everything is better and I see a guidance counsellor at school and a psychiatrist outside of school. <br>  <br>  talk to your guidance counsellor. it really helps to get your feeligs out and have someone to talk to in complete confidentiality. Do your parents know you cut? My mom is aware of my cutting and she really helped me and supported me when I decided to stop. Then there was trichotillomania which i recently stopped, again i got a lot of support from my mother. <br>  <br>  Talk to a psychiatrist and if you don't know anyone, just get a refferal from your doctor. <br>  <br>  I'm just one year younger than you, so there can't be a HUGE difference. I know exactly where your coming from and i've even experienced abuse from my father, i've been to court many times and i had to watch so many people get hurt.

But it wasn't until I got a little older that I realized it was probably just hormones. You're still young, so it's probably that the crazy amount of hormones racing through you right now plus the added stress of growing up and figuring out who you are equals thinking you're depressed and losing your mind.<br>  <br>  I know when I was in middle school, like 13 or 14, me and all my friends thought we were depressed and would hate our lives and cut ourselves (not together...that'd be kinda weird) but in retrospect, a lot of it was just being dramatic cause it's what teenagers do. The best solution would be to adjust your frame of reference. Instead of focusing on the negative drama in your life, find something positive to do instead. Maybe join a club or play a sport.<br>  <br>  Really the best thing to do is wait it out. It may seem like dyadic drama is the biggest thing in your life right now but in a few years it won't even matter. I'd start thinking about college and such because A) it'll take your mind off of it B) the more college options you have, the more likely you can get out of town and start over somewhere else. It's a win-win.<br>  <br>  And something I wish I'd known when I was in your situation: You have a lot more control over the drama in your life than you think. It's so much easier to walk away from a stressful situation with your friends than you'd imagine. Just don't make them out to be more important in the long run than they really are, and stop cutting yourself. It's awkward down the road when you've grown up and moved on but you still have the scars for people to look at. I know when people see mine and ask about them I don't even know what to say. It's definitely the biggest regret I have.<br>  <br>  But most importantly, be happy. You're the only person that can make yourself really be happy. You have a lot of life ahead of you so don't waste it all being sad!|`|ObjkHsz8aa	sweetie, i went through the exact same thing when i was your exact age! i know exactly how you feel.  And honestly, right now is the hardest time of your life. People are mean, stress of everyday life seems unbareable, and it feels like you are spriraling downwards.  <br>  I ended up keeping it in until i turned to drugs. That was a mistake. it ended up mixing with the chemical embalance i had to begin with. Which caused the depression to get a lot worse! <br>  So, after my life escalated into a huge blow-up (we won't go into specifics about that!) My parents had me talk to a therapist. She helped me through things. I was able to voice everything i was feeling to a person i could relate to. who wouldn't judge me. She didn't give me advice. She helped me sort out my thoughts. Then i realized, all the answers were in that blurry head of mine!  After i got slightly older, and my hormones were starting to settle from being in overdrive, my life started to make sense again!!<br>  Try not to let everything bother you so much. Just breathe....<br>  High School sucks!! it feels like an eternity to you just being there. But you're surrounded by a lot of people with their own set of problems.  Why do you think they make so many problems for others?!<br>  And please, promise me you won't cut yourself anymore.  I did it a few times...well, a good many times.  It makes you feel better at the time. it's like you're creating a hole in your body for your emotions to escape out of. i get it! but honestly, it doesn't help anything in the long run. you just have nasty scars :(  But in actuality, the reason you feel better instantly is bc you release endorphins in your brain.  Endorphins are also released when you're in love, from chocolate, or when you excercise.<br>  But i want you to know that you're not the only one who's felt this way. it's a natural thing! Your body is out of control right now. But i'm here for you. i've been there and done that!  Just know that this will pass.  High school is only a small part of your life.  I graduated in '03 and i feel like that was a different life to me now! and it was only 5 years ago! (almost 6...wow...time flies!<br>  I'm hear for you, baby girl! you can get through this if i did.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps- there are several online questions you can answer. i don't know which is the best one. Just look up Depression Tests. But don't put too much confidence in them. After all, they're only around 10 questions!|`|WwxXUeDCaa	Many teenagers feel that people don't understand--sometimes that is a normal "growing pain". But based on your personal description, I do think that you may be depressed, and for that condition to be evaluated, professional help is indicated. The kind of isolation, and dejection you feel are a few of the many symptoms of depression, which is one of the most common mental health problems, and is quite treatable. There is a variety of treatments for depression ranging from medication to cognitive -behavioral techniques to holistic mind-body therapies to energy medicine to group therapy, among others.<br>  <br>  If you can't talk to your parents about your troubles, perhaps you could talk to the school counselor or a clergy person. Those adults could help to bridge the gap by educating and engaging your parents in a positive way.<br>  <br>  Because you are cutting, which is a maladaptive coping mechanism, that basically avoids the underlying issues and feelings, it can become addictive, which presents a whole other set of challenges to overcome. Early detection and intervention bode the best for a successful recovery.<br>  <br>  I think you are very brave and smart to try to get help for yourself now.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|hDmmoxWCaa	Hey, i am sorry to hear  about this. But from reading what your wrote, you do seem  depressed. High school is a big part of somebody's life, it can effect the peroson you could be in life, if you let some things effect you. What you got to understand is that high school is such a SMALL part in life, it really is like a little peble on a huge beach. Its such a small part in life, you have a whole beach to explore ( meaning life) <br>       Cutting yourself is not a good way of handling things. You should not hurt yourself. I think in my opinion you need to find someone to talk to who you are close with, wheather its  family or a freind your close with. But you should find someone you can talk to whats bothering you. Holding all these things inside is not good  for your health. Dont hold these issues inside. <br>   Mabey talk to your parents about maybe getting a psychologist. They do help, alot of people see them. Just because you see one does not mean your crazy. Thats far from the truth. People see them for a lot of issues. anything from dealing with a death of a loved one, relationship problems  and even problems within yourself. They do listen and its confidential. I think you should check into that. it helps..<br>  <br>  remeber family is always gonna be there for you, no matter what. I know sometimes  things can be stressful. I would  know, but you and hold these things in. Stop cutting yourself.. thats not good.|`|nEv5HqDsaa	Hun, dont be so harsh on urself. Every kid goes thru the "emo" stage, life is never always just rainbows and butterflies. It's effed up ur best friend is dating ur ex bf, but that just shows shes nowhere near best friend status, drop her. if ur other friend is mad at u for no reason, just know that she's still a kid herself. When I was ur age I had a lot of drama too, unncessary ones, but as u grow older people become less immature and everything gets better. <br>  But stop cutting urself, it doesnt solve anything. Speak with a school counsellor if ur that depressed. Take care
QsbB6vkoaa	i think ( not sure though) that you uterus is getting ready to carry a child. i mean a lot of different stuff happens to our body and most of the time we have no idea. if it's not that maybe you should best wait for your tests and you might find out that this happens to a lot of people.<br>  good luck
yrChf3iBaa	Hi, <br>  <br>  I was a flight attendant for 9 years and I never heard of concussions being a risk when flying as a passenger. If your doctor cleared you to fly, that is a good indicator that things should be fine. Nonetheless, upon boarding the flight, I would let the flight attendants know about your concern. This way, if anything was to happen to you in-flight, they will know to give this information to any medical staff who may help you. It will also allow you to have some peace of mind, as anxiety is likely a worse state than being concussed when flying. ;)
bQ4RAi07aa	Lay back cross one leg over the other and pull into the chest area. As for the mermaid play around with the angle untill untill you can feel that hip pain we all know and love! from there just hold it for a minute or so, do 3 or 4 sets and always try to increase the stretch. Hope this helps.

This will lead to stress build up and eventually make you ill.<br>  <br>  I am surprised you haven't mentioned any involvement from Social Services or a support group?  If she has not been assessed by SS, I advise that you make arrangements for this even if your mother refuses.<br>  <br>  We could spend all day talking about the complexities of your mothers illness, but to be fair, this issue is about you.  You yourself need to be able to see that her illness makes her behave in such a destructive way, and you also need to be able to switch your feelings towards her from anxiety and anger, to understanding and maybe this in itself will help your stress levels?<br>  <br>  Be honest with your family and tell them how hard it is for you.  If they care about you then they will understand.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.|`|dgm1UTadaa	You can try to cook up a story and telling your mum about another similar incident which happen to your friend.<br>  Then relate to her what happened ( that is telling her what she is doing to you and your family and the ill effects but using your friend as a third party).<br>  Eventually your friend left her mum as the mum makes no effort to change.<br>  Bottom line, if your mum cannot change, the best course is to leave her.<br>  Here is the danger...if you do not find a solution, you may take on this similar behavior and when you have kids, the cycle repeats.<br>  Best course of action is to seek professional help.|`|v811KD7raa	sounds like all of you would benefit from her having a support worker to help out a few hours a day so that you and your dad get some respite.  cant you get the doctor to get someone to carry out a needs and risk assessment and then draw up a care plan?<br>  <br>  if not, you need to try to get her to see that her behaviour is destructive, to get her to see that patterns of behaviour that alienate family members are bad, and so changes in her behaviour and attitude are needed, including her attitude to the idea that youre entitled to a life and a boyfriend of your choosing|`|HdvdSu8Waa	I understand this situation is distressing for you, and that because it has been going on for so long, you feel worn down.<br>  <br>  You are right to hold onto your independence and boyfriend - to assure your stability.<br>  <br>  Your mum does have a mental health problem - joining her will not help you, or help you to help your mum. Be clear about that.<br>  <br>  Accept you have limits. Know your limits. Allot just so much time each day / week to your mum. When that is done, understand you do not have to commit more time to coping with what amounts to an almost impossible situation - you cannot cure her, or change her.<br>  <br>  Yes, be supportive - help your dad.<br>  But avoid getting dragged into guilt trips laid on you, and blame games started by your mum and continued by others who have not bothered to find out your side of the story. <br>  <br>  Yes, it hurts when affections do not rest with you - but don't cut yourself up over people who judge you unfairly. Better to influence them keeping a safe distance.<br>  <br>  Don't be distracted - your mum gave you a life - so live your life. She has no right to try and take your life away. Love your mum, but don't love her too much. You have a good head on your shoulders, so you will cope - I just know you will.|`|jQBM2AGkaa	My best friend is in a similar situation. Unfortunately, I don't think there's much anyone can tell you that will help you get out of this situation - the only thing that can happen is, ultimately, you find the strength to stand up for yourself. I don't mean that in a horrible way; much the opposite, I'm saying that there's no-one here who can claim to know the answer because they don't know you, or your family.<br>   My advice would be to invest in what makes you happy - your boyfriend, and not risk losing him by giving your loyalty to the people who make you unhappy. If your mother won't have your boyfriend in the house for special occasions, spend them with him. She's controlling you, and she knows it. Once you take away that control, you can bet that she'll become scared enough to compromise. <br>   It's horrible to be in the middle like this, especially when it's your family, because you feel like blood is thicker than water and you can't abandon them. But you deserve your happiness and you don't deserve the way it sounds like you're treated by them. You've more than repaid them for bringing you up by the way you've cared for them over the years... so don't let them bully you with that.<br>  <br>  To put it bluntly, the only way you'll get out of this is by taking a stand. Otherwise it will never change. I really hope you manage to sort things out! Good luck. x
YiY9Yd2Jaa	You need protein but not things like a steak that take several hours to digest. Look for faster sources of easily digestible high protein foods. Not knowing your tastes or your budget I can't really recommend, but I will often have a fresh prawn (shrimp) and cheese omelet along with a milk drink made from fresh milk with sufficient milk powder to make twice the quantity again. It makes a pretty good thickshake when whipped with some fruit or flavouring. I make it up in the mornings and keep a large jug in the refrigerator. The prawn omelet takes less than two or three minutes to make - is tasty and digests easily. You can also use things like tuna or salmon - (I prefer smoked) in an omelet.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	If you are trying to put on muscle then you should drink a protein shake or drink milk like the last guy said pretty soon after you work out.  However, you shouldn't actually lose protein when you work out unless you are very very underweight and have not got enough fat and carbs for your body to burn, so I don't know what he's talking about there.<br>  If you want to lose weight then you should eat about an hour before you work out but not again for at least another couple of hours after you've worked out, there's some complicated reason for this involving insulin but I can't remember what it is.<br>  Eat plenty of complex carbs like wholemeal bread, veg and fruit|`|AwpSwwcfaa	If you are strength training (weights and such) you should eat something with a high amount of protien about 15 minutes after your work out. Something such as a protien shake, a low carb protien bar, cheese, chicken, handful of nuts or a spoonful of peanut butter, etc... It is very important that your muscles get the extra protien to help repair themselves and to give you the shape that you are looking for!<br>  <br>  If you are working out doing aerobics or cardio you shouldn't eat anything until about an hour after you work out and with that you can eat any type of snack that is high in protien, low in carbs, fat and calories! That way your body uses stored fat to burn energy rather than the fat from the food that you are eating!<br>  <br>  Thats the best advice I can give... Hope it helps!|`|zRlKNCcSaa	you should eat within 20 minutes of working out<br>  protein is a good thing to eat because you lose a lot when you work out<br>  <br>  this is going to sound so weird but the best drink to have after is not a protein shake or a meal replacement but a glass of chocolate milk.. yes chocolate... it replenishes a lot<br>  <br>  also you should drink a bottle of water 1 hour before your work out and hydrate at night as well... at least 2 bottles or glasses an evening<br>  <br>  good luck!
AStIzKtxaa	To incorporate running into your exercise regimen, I would begin with a ten minute jogging warm-up, followed by some light stretching.  You don't want to expend too much energy on your warm up, as you will need the energy for the lift and run that lie ahead.  After you break a minor sweat, I would then move on to whatever weight training routine you typically perform.  <br>  <br>  The trick is to find an equilibrium in your running, that is, you don't want to run too much and you don't want to run too little.  For example, the ten minute jogging warm up I recommended is not sufficient for your goal.<br>  <br>  Too little running won't give you the results you want, meaning you may continue to put on more muscle, but you won't see results in building muscle definition. <br>  <br>  Last spring I ran 8-10 miles a day and tried to weight train on top of that.  No matter how many calories I consumed, I still could not keep the weight from melting off me.  I burned off calories, fat and, unfortunately muscle.  I began to look skeletal and erased any muscle gains I would have normally experienced through weight training.<br>  <br>  Based off of my experience last spring I would recommend that when you are finished with your weight training, go for no more than a 2-3 mile jog, followed by a cool down walk and some deep stretching.  <br>  <br>  Pay attention to your body, and make sure if you start running that you stay hydrated throughout the day. Also make sure to consume plenty of calories from carbs and protein (you know best what your body needs), and you should not notice a decrease in muscle mass, but you will see an increase in definition. <br>  <br>  P.S., I've found green tea and Korean red ginseng to be helpful supplements when training.  Maybe you should check them out as well.|`|FmGcin0Raa	Yes, I do! If you have a treadmill, jog whilst carrying weights and gently swaying you're arms no more than usual. After a good solid 30 minutes jogging 5 days a week (at a reasonable speed, say 5-6mph) you will have longer endurance, making you able to run for longer, if not faster as well. <br>  <br>  The weights will work on you're arms simultaneously, and although it may not feel like much at first, 30 mins of weights in hand is quite strenuous. <br>  <br>  Last thing: you should find the 30 minutes easier after a few weeks, so try running for 35 mintues with slightly heavier weights and so on..|`|CCpUkt4Raa	the best thing to do is to do at least 10min of running before your work out (at your own past). this will really help you out and as long as you keep it up you'll be noticing improvements ;D|`|bQbaGIuPaa	running is... faster then walking!|`|OSXAPmrcaa	go to that blog and scroll one down to the running guide.<br>  <br>  Here's a 10-week beginner's plan to get you started on your walk/run program. I suggest running/walking every Monday , Wednesday , Friday and Saturday at least 4x a week.

34a008185ae3cdb2fe7e67d0b5a0a4aaaa	Well, i have been drinking hot green tea daily at work for at least the last 2 years.  I have over all lost 30 lbs- BUT throughout all of this time i was on weight watchers, and had massive lung surgery to remove a tumor.  I decided to start drinking green tea as a replacement to diet soda and the normal crap that i drink throughout the day. (i had a diet soda revelation after surgery)  It gets more water in me and i feel like im doing something better for myself.  So, i wouldnt say the tea actually made me lose the weight, but it went hand in hand with the other healthy changes i made.  So if you drink soda then i can see replacing it with tea can do you good.|`|3ctL64O4aa	No That is true, the stuff in the tea breaks down the food therefore helps you to digest it.

Self harming is like an addiction. I used to self harm and havnt since I met my boyfriend over a year ago but I still get urges to do it. Just let her know that you are there for her. You are both going through the same thing so you can help each other out. Self harming isnt the answer for anything as I came to realise so I would advise you to stop doing that too. You will know what to say to her tomorrow when you meet up, as you both start to talk about it, all your emotions will spill out and you will both be there for each other. Thats what friends are for. I hope you both feel better soon! Good luck! :)

lHPLbQI9aa	There's a lot of info on google that may go into more detail. The basic theory is that back when our bodies evolved, when food may not always be plentiful all the time (before storing surplus and freezing and other great inventions), your body would do its best to protect itself it lean times. When you start eating a lot less food like on a normal diet, your body may react by slowing your metabolism down so that you do not require as many calories for normal activity - sometimes called "starvation mode". The extreme case in nature is animals that hibernate during lean times.<br>  <br>  The idea behind calorie shifting is that you eat a reduced number of calories, but that you vary the number of calories you eat each day, and also which meals are your larger meals, so that your body never goes into starvation mode. Exactly how many calories you eat, or how you vary them seems to depend on the diet.<br>  <br>  For a good free resource to learn a little bit more about how the body works and how it related to weight management, I'd recommend taking a look at "The Hacker's Diet <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/." rel="nofollow">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/.</a> It's a good basic start that will help you understand more about what other diets are trying to do.
5UaVp256aa	<a href="http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/" rel="nofollow">http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/</a> is a new approach on quitting. The site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking, and it's free.<br>  <br>  "It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you."|`|K2dNndE2aa	I just saw an article on Yahoo that had really good tips of helping you quit. I'll try to find it for you but all I can remember is "Don't do it alone--quit with someone, or have someone hold you accountable for smoking" and "Don't go cold turkey, and use like gum or the patch then gradually wean yourself off nicotine"<br>  <br>  EDIT: well here's this, I didn't find the yahoo article, you can try looking for it though if you want...<br>  <a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_10_13X_Guide_for_Quitting_Smoking.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/conten...</a>|`|QT0qTFyAaa	I've been on the patch for 10 days now and haven't had a cigarette since I started. I have had some terrible urges to smoke, but I won't do it. I suck on a pretzel rod because it feels like your puffing on a smoke. I also keep a straw in the car to put in my mouth when I drive.<br>  <br>  I also started working out 2 months ago when i got laid off. Now I am increasing my running. I am up to 1.5 miles already. I want to be able to run 3 miles.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	none of those things really work. You have to just decide your gonna do it and quite cold turkey. If you try to ween yourself off by patches or whatever means you will still have the nicotine in your system. The sooner the nicotine is out of your system the less you will crave them. Thy to avoid the places you use to smoke. Like if you smoke in a chair on your porch or something. Don't sit on the porch because you will start craving it. I also suggest keeping your self as busy as possible. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Michelle|`|rh5vbol9aa	Its really very good idea.<br>  Just for you an advise: The bulgarians has a very effective and harmless medicine. Its origin is natural.

Contact the American Lung Association, Ohio quit line and www.way 2 quit.com.  Try doing what we call the 4 D's when you get the urge to smoke.<br>  Delay, Do Something Else, Deep Breath, Drink Water<br>  Delaying smoking by doing something else will hep the craving to pass.  The craving will pass in a few minutes.  Deep breathing gets more oxygen into your lungs an body and drink plenty of water to help flush toxins out o your body..  Keep healthy snacks near by, such as fresh fruits , pop corn, high fiber and whole grains.  Get plenty of rest and make sure you have daily physical activity, this increases the same "good feeling" you got when you smoked.   Hope this is helpful and good luck on your journey to be smoke free.

Keep your friend in your prayers.|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	When someone is sad for no reason and depressed without any cause, it's usually time for them to go to a psychiatrist, as you suggested. There's really no other way for you to help him, as you're not a trained psychiatrist and you can't force him to go.|`|ZDdUSL2Naa	There doesnt always have to be a specific trigger to cause depression, it can simply just be a feeling usually caused by a chemical imbalance. He should probably see his doctor to see if he could maybe prescribe him something or advise him to change something in his life. There are also great homoeopathic remedies for depression if he doesnt want to be out on pills. I think he should definitely seek medical advise anyway! I hope this helps a little! :)|`|yl0ZXf0Maa	When I became depressed last year, I really had nothing to be depressed about. I had lots of friends, great grades, loved my new school and was generally having a great time.<br>  But it was the things in the past that had effected me, I have always been the most cheery one among my friends, no one understood how I could become depressed, neither did I.<br>  <br>  It was only when I went to see a psychiatrist that I realized things that had happened in the past had made me feel so sad about myself and the things around me. In High School I was bullied and the typical out cast, I have always had issues with my weight and used to find it hard to socialize. I recommend you try and persuade your friend into speaking to a professional, ask him to try it and remind him that if he doesn't like it, then he can stop. <br>  <br>  Also he may feel down because he has a negative outlook on life, this can happen without realizing it as such. He may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, or even reading books that try and help you gain a positive outlook.<br>  <br>  Keep trying to help him, with out exerting too much pressure. If he is too scared to see a psychiatrist on his own, go with him for the first session, I did this with a friend, they realized that it wasn't so bad, and since then they have gone on their own and feel a hundred times better!

AA11388527	I rather doubt that a high school student would have HIV infection, any hepatitis or anything serious you need to worry about.  I see no evidence that you're a hypochondriac but you may be a germophobe.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I believe you are definetly hypochondriac and also OCD.  While you should be concerned about HIV, you can't make yourself crazy.  Exchange of bodily fluids, sharing contaminated needles, contaminated blood transfusions.  This is how you get HIV.  However, you can get many other things like the common cold, flu, strep throat from the scenarios you describe.  If this guy put your pen in his mouth, slobbering all over it and then came toward you with it to scratch you, why didn't you get up and tell him to knock it off!  At the very least, you could get an infection.  You should carry those little wipes you use to sterilize your hands.  Use them before eating if you can't get to bathroom to wash.  Also, tell this guy in no uncertain terms not to touch you with his saliva, blood, etc.  (I did read your previous question).  He sounds like he needs to have some consequences as the result of his behaviors.  Warn him that you will not put up with his nonsense anymore and let him know you will report his very immature behaviors (even for an 8th grader) to the teacher, dean/principal, whoever is in charge of your school. These behaviors should not be tolerated, not because of HIV so much but because of spreading other illnesses unnecessarily.

AA10118929	Depends how bad your initial break was.  If it is just a fracture, the cast is just keeping you from doing further damage.  However if the bone is actually a full fledged break and you had pins put in your leg.  You may want to have it looked at.  If the pain subsides them more than likely you will be fine.  You should decorate your cast all up and perhaps they will notice you more and watch where they are going.  You should have hit them over the head with your crutches.<br>  <br>  Try some casttoos for your cast and I hope you feel better:<br>  <a href="http://orthotape.com/casttoo.asp" rel="nofollow">http://orthotape.com/casttoo.asp</a>|`|1a500f4a1ff001d472b35d6b9566fe53aa	Will the high school you go to let you take time off for a broken leg? <br>  Will the boys get expelled from school for making you and the other girls fall down and get hurt? If you can you need time off of school to let your leg heal. Don't worry if you have to go back to the hospital a few times so the doctor knows how you are doing. Are you taking any medicine for your broken leg? for the pain? Prayer always works when you need a healing from Jesus. When I was in a car accident I got a broken arm. I went for physical therapy after the accident. I saw a bone specialist once a week. The doctor took x-rays and thought there was no way I could be healed. When I went to church and got prayer, then went back to the doctor for another x-ray when he checked the charts the bone in my arm had healed over. Miracles can happen if only you believe.|`|jPA0CA7aaa	girl i know how you feel,i went there so often the knew my name whenever they first saw me,anyway since you are the one paying them you have the right to go down there whenever there is an emergency and if the act like butt holes you have the right to report them!!!|`|fQyFFEg5aa	just go to the damn hospital their paid enough to look and take care of you anyways!!|`|ZphvM2Rpaa	I would definitely do something because it may not heal correctly if  you don't do anything and it hurts. I'm not an expert on that but I know that you should probably do something about it if it hurts and that happened. Hope everythings okay!|`|EyP4d90Paa	Yes, you should go to the hospital. Explain what happened and that you are having increased pain since the most recent incident.|`|A57Qjaszaa	go home and rest...<br>  I don't think it's surprising that your leg hurts after that, so just rest it...<br>  if it still hurts after 24 hours maybe ring your GP, hospital or NHS Direct and see if they think you need to be seen...<br>  Good luck|`|22Oy1qp0aa	What? If you leg seems broken of course you go to the hospital! Duh! Who cares if they know you go there often...|`|qnU1HS1aaa	Uh... go to the hospital. duh.|`|6QmDm8iwaa	awwww its pathetic how they dont let you use any elevators and if they dont have any then they should put some in. i will never understand the school system|`|LtZ064eoaa	go to the hospital it's for your health and your cause so what if they have something to say besides it's their job to help and heal the ill if they don't like it they should change their job!

Rarely will a circumcision be necessary.<br>  You need to do some stretching exercises, ideally in the bath/shower, every day for a few weeks.

You might be able to stretch the phimotic band a tad, but if it's really bad, you may need some minor surgery to correct the problem, and I'm not talking a circumcision here.  The doc can actually cut the phimotic band.  If it's really a bad case of phimosis, then circumcision is your only help.

Maybe you should check out an online website like sparkteens.com.. i use them every week to help me lose weight. Weight Watchers is my thang, but hun, keep your head up. you are still growing. I dont like being the fat girl in class either. Find an "exercize" buddy.. a friend that is willing to go jogging/walking with you! I use my friend brittney.. she may walk slow, but its better than being alone. Its good that you do volleyball! Keep your head up girl! <br>       Just so we're clear, that acai berry crap doesnt really work. It's cancer causing chemicals-pills.

That's the first thing you need to do, find out how overweight you are. To be halthy you should get to that point and maybe a little more to have some room. Of course being 12 you could still grow so don't be too worried about getting that exact number. It is going to take a long time though. I have a plan to lose 10 lbs by THE END of summer, because trust me it's much easier to lose weight in summer when you have school and stress. You have to cut down which you already did and when you get exersize, really push yourself, and if you're not getting sweating it's not good enough. You should get exersize at least an hour a day. You can ride bikes or play sports and make up outdoor games with friends and make sure it's fun so it doesn't feel like work. Just getting outside will make you feel so much better. And don't try to lose 20 lbs in 3 months or less, it won't happen...make it more realistic, i know it's hard because when I was your age I was 120 and feeling fat, but the older you get the more you know about being healthy! Now I like my body,although I have days I can't find anything to wear because I feel like I look fat in everything but I just want to be healthy, it's much more important and it's gonna take time to lose 20 lbs, a long time. Just try to not gain weight and get exersize and eat good foods and wait a couple years and then try to lose it because it will be easier then when you know more.|`|7F6qIdJqaa	You should ask for a nutritionists help to make sure you're getting good foods with nutrients to help your young body grow healthy.<br>  <br>  Knock off the pop-diet or regular and snack foods. Try to get raw veggies and fruit in your diet. If you eat a lot of low sugar-fat foods before you hang out with your friends, candy and McDonalds won't be so tempting.<br>  <br>  And by the way..at your age girls tend to be a little bit over weight before their body matures.|`|DuFUWSLoaa	Some foods that will help are things like having salads for lunch, maybe a little caesar salad.   However, to make things easier, if you go to a fast food restaurant, try to avoid the fries.  The fries are the worst.  But, if you're in the mood for them, just get one and split it with your parents.  Also, I don't know why your parents won't put you in a club because of your weight (I'm from USA so that kind of sounds wierd, no offense).  Howver, for more advanced info, just google it.|`|f42d8b7e66c90b1ca20d54971e939d3caa	I know someone who lost weight eating tuna with rice for breakfast lunch and dinner of course they exercised often as well.The rice is packed with the carbs for energy while not being fatning and the tuna is packed with protein as well.<br>  <br>  The person i know lost like 80 pounds real fast just do that and workout.<br>  <br>  Im not a doctor so im not suggesting this but i have seen this work so its up to you but its probably best to consult a doctor first.<br>  <br>  Free stuff for searching the net<br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=374732" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a>|`|x691c210aa	Kids your age shouldn't be concerned about weight. Just eat healthy. If you are comfortable with who you are everything will work out. <br>  <br>  People tend to get depressed/emotionally connected to weight, so much so that whenever they mess up on something they eat bad food for them and gain weight. Moral of story id that the more stressed out about your weight, the more you'll be unhappy and eat unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Just try to be healthy and be concerned with you own self image, don't worry about others
qV8Vz36Iaa	I think it would be best to get to root cause of any problem rather than medicate it with prescription or herbal solutions. Please consult with a specialist about this. You might talk to a good counselor about your feelings and potential treatment.<br>  <br>  However, it cannot hurt to look at your lifestyle and do what you can to improve it. I would start first with diet. Are you eating too much fat and sugar? Are you eating food additives that could contribute to allergic reaction? Are you getting proper nutrition? Are you having an adverse reaction to a prescription drug?<br>  <br>  I'd consider a low-fat vegan diet where you eliminate items like: Meat, Milk/Dairy(not tolerated by many), caffiene, salt, sugar, fructose, refined carbs, juices, soda, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, chemicals, MSG, and so on. Many people have negative reactions to commercial/convenience foods. You may be one of them.<br>  <br>  You should eat one teaspoon of good oil, but not much more. You should also eat beans, brown rice, whole wheat, whole fruits, and vegetables.<br>  <br>  If your MD approves and you are fit and healthy, you should work up to about 1 hour of aerobic exercise, five days per week. You must monitor your heart rate to keep it in a comfortable aerobic zone for the entire exercise period.<br>  <br>  There are efforts under way to reduce dosages of effective herbal remedies, so I would not count on any herb you can purchase in a store. However, many herbs like St. Johns Wort is effective when used appropriately.|`|SroGRBUDaa	I used it as well as aroma therepy, and both together calmed me right down.  There was a scent at the bath and body shop called tranquil sleep, that is the one I got, they dont have it anylonger but I am sure they have something similar if not better.  The St. Johns Wort was great though.  It just gave me an Aaaaaahhhhhhhh kind of feeling.  Like I had finally come to rest. The two together did the trick and I was a whole different person.|`|ho73OV9Uaa	i used it 2 years ago during my matric year and it helped me a bit but not a lot. my mom also used it during school and she loved it! it really worked for her, so its probably different with each person. i would definitely say give it a try. you should definitely see an improvement-- big or small..<br>  good luck!
jvJqmliBaa	i was in cross country and i also smoked...at first it didnt affect me at all ..but eventually i started noticing a difference..my advice would be to quit smoking so you can continue running|`|AA10450066	I would definitely stop all together now while you still can. If you want something to do when your out with friends I found a good substitute to be a swizzle stick or something like that. It'll give you the same "something to do with your hands" feeling that you get when smoking. That won't affect your lungs nor is it addictive as cigarettes are. In the long run not only will you always be sure of that second wind, but you'll be healthier too. Hope this helps. It sure helped me.

Your bloating could be from water retention, constipation, or a number of other things.|`|9iOHAC41aa	I wouldn't be to concerned with it, but it couldn't hurt to be sure. Just go buy a cheap little pregnancy test (because i don't care what anyone says, those ones from the dollar store work just the same as all the expensive high tech ones...those are the ones they use at the doctors anyways.)

There is such thing as pre-***, which can just as easily get you pregnant; therefor, the pulling out method doesn't work. He might as well have came in you. <br>  <br>  Considering you skipped a period just after this, it is a sign that you may indeed be pregnant. I suggest you go to the store and buy an at-home pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you aren't pregnant since it appears you are way under informed when it comes to pregnancy.|`|dPYotwUxaa	My Mother was like that, i think the Doctor said it was a "birth".

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Your period should start during the white pills, but necessarily on the first day.

t9Nw86Plaa	Did you start taking the pill at the right time (ie. during or immediately after your last period)? Starting the pill when you're mid-cycle can make your periods irregular... the best way to correct it is to stop taking the pill, have a complete pill-free cycle (use a different method of non-hormonal birth control, like condoms) and start taking the pills again at the correct time.<br>  <br>  If you started taking your pills at the right time, and have been taking them at the same time every day, then you'll just need to wait it out for a couple of months (VERY annoying, trust me I understand.. but in the long run it's better to give your body a chance to get used to this pill before ditching it and trying something new).<br>  <br>  Since you are taking quite a high-dose pill, it is likely that by giving it a couple of months, your body will settle down and your periods will become very light and infrequent (I'm on a very similar pill and only bleed once a year now... but the first couple of months were hell for me as well). <br>  <br>  I wouldn't change pills unless ABSOLUTELY necessary (ie. you go more than 6 months with this crazy bleeding) because a lower dose pill would only make you spot more often. Instead, if it's been a long time and your periods still aren't normal, I would stick with the pill but go back to the doctor and get her to check out other causes of irregular bleeding (ie. blood tests, ultrasounds, swabs, smears and other unpleasant but necessary things).|`|v30TPwUtaa	I learned that skipping pills can do that.|`|zDNRgpD1aa	it takes your body a while to get used to the pill. i have known people with the same problem it should go back to normal in a bit

If you find regular condoms fit too tight (either causing discomfort or breakage), you may want to experiment with large condoms. Large condoms may be longer, wider, or both.

QBFANhXaaa	This may sound weird, but you could be having painful gas. Try taking some beano or gas-x and see if it helps. <br>  <br>  This could be caused by a food allergy. Try to stop drinking dairy products and see if that helps. If it doesn't then try to stop eating wheat. If that doesn't help, then try to stop eating fructose. Dairy, wheat, and fructose are common food allergies which can cause painful gas. If changing your diet doesn't help, go back to the doctor.
u8CFwtyMaa	When you were born, your foreskin was attached to your glans to protect it. This usually becomes free before puberty, and at 14, your foreskin should have detached from the glans, so I assume the problem is that your foreskin is too tight to retract fully.<br>  You should be able to stretch it yourself, do it in the bath or shower, where the hot water will soften the skin. When your penis is soft, insert a clean finger under the foreskin, and stretch it gently - don't hurt yourself, or you may damage the skin.<br>  When you are erect, just pull the skin back gently, again don't do it so much that it hurts.<br>  If you do this daily, it should loosen up noticeably after a few weeks, just keep at it, and soon you'll be able to pull it all the way back, and wash under it.<br>  Pulling the skin back every time you pee will help, as will masturbating, but at 14, I don't suppose I need to tell you to do that!<br>  Hope this helps|`|a1pmr73vaa	No,your just not ready and not all belts are the same..wtf.|`|3EIZ9vkeaa	When your in the shower try to slowly pull back your foreskin and do it over a long time.

If you cannot do it like this then you must go to the doctors because it is important to clean underneat the foreskin as when you get older a lot of smegma forms, which is white stuff which looks like cottage cheese. This gives you an increased risk of infection and can also cause cancer.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	With some young guys it take a few years for them to be able to retract the foreskin over the head of their penis . Do not try to force as it can get stuck and sometimes split the skin <br>  However each day in the shower you can start to ease it back , and gradually it should become easier and comfortable to do this . In the end at around 17/18 if you are still having an issue with this you should ask the doctor for advice .

Being fourteen though it might be that your a late starter which could mean your penis hasn't "developed" fully yet. <br>  If by the time your, i'd say sixteen, THEN i'd go to docs because you might need to be circumcised. <br>  no big deal just an inconvenience really.<br>  <br>  (=|`|1ttID2PYaa	are you uncircumcised? if you are then ya you need to go see a doctor and see what is wrong. if not then i don't know what you are talking about|`|Ob1uAFOqaa	That ain't bad mate. just keep pulling the foreskin back further when your in the shower, and for gods sake, dont go to a doctor!! :D|`|gzpJsfT7aa	Just keep trying to get it out dont rush tho or you can rip the skin hot water all so help. good luck dude|`|H1qwIaP1aa	Its not supposed to come off.

Time to get past the denial and get on with reality.|`|7geLpG6Oaa	I'm so sorry. :( My grandma had lung cancer and underwent treatment for it. A yr. later she lost use of her arm and everyone thought she may have a had a stroke. My dad finally went to take her to see a doctor and they found out the lung cancer had spread to her brain. They did radiation treatment to try to shrink the tumors and thats all they could really do. When someone has multiple tumors there is a big risk for them to try to operate on all of them. And they really can't do anything about the stomach lining. I'm sorry that you are going through this.|`|AA10751264	There was a tv show a few years ago, called, Three's Company, Suzanne Sumers starred in that and she later got breast cancer and started some treatments and became cured, the cancer has never came back. I can't remember just what the alternative treatments were she chose but she is still promoting that,she was on Larry King live this past winter talking about how great it was  for her. Also, I would talk to the American Cancer Society, they may have some really good innovative ideas too. Good luck, God Bless.|`|7BaHGMEyaa	i doubt it doctors know what they're talking about and they would know of anything better and would of recommended it. I wouldn't recommend a really strong chemo as it probably wouldn't work and it makes you weak, vulnerable to infection, immune system doesn't work as well and so on. If i was you i'd spend quality time with your dad and make him happy. good luck and all my hope x
00IZYVjsaa	I have TMJ, and it sounds like that's what it is. You probably want to go to the dentist to be sure though, and they'll tell you for sure what to do. If it starts hurting, you'll want to go to the dentist, but it's usually nothing too terribly serious. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/tmj-disorders/DS00355/DSECTION=symptoms" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/tmj-dis...</a>|`|jvJqmliBaa	My fiance has severe TMJ..his jaw has gotten locked open and he couldnt shut his mouth..we had to take him to the ER so they could pop it back into place..Go talk to your dr and see if thats what you have..also if it bothers you, make sure to not chew gum, that could make it worse
LbDoNsQqaa	well the two things you gave could be true but you sadly could have artheritis its doubt ful get an x-ray done by your doc it might help|`|7NDg1wjQaa	Idk about the things that you have listed but you probably need to see a doctor to see if you broke it.|`|Z5V2yjSWaa	Well do you crack that finger a lot? it could be cuz of that and idk anything else sorry|`|sZ2LVd0faa	you might of broken it or done something to your tendons. get it checked out. hope it gets better x
UeWHGsqzaa	What you are describing sounds very much like a possible tendonitis. The area you are referring to contains both the anterior and posterior tibial tendons. While you may not recall specifically any trauma or injury, it is possible that you may have strained the area simply by applying pressure to the site during any movement. it is possible that you may have inadvertently injured the tendons this way. A doctor may recommend the best treatment for this: rest and the NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).|`|7NDg1wjQaa	You could have broke or sprained it.|`|Eh8Tb8bOaa	sprianed your leg|`|LbDoNsQqaa	you couldve pulled a muscle or just simply have lactic acid nothing too worrying

aiBOMU9kaa	With that high an Rx, you definately want, and need high index.<br>  <br>  Polycarb isn't really much good in Rx's over - 3.00<br>  <br>  The High index, ( a 1.67 ) would be perfect in your case. It is not only thinner than polycarb, but the optics are far superior.<br>  <br>  A polycarb lens in those powers would have so much chromatic aberration at the edges , they would drive you nuts. ( rainbow colors )|`|c65fb963b3da6c519b15451a2e627eecaa	If you decide on the high index, which I hope you do, go for the 1.67 or 1.70 high index.  And please make sure the optician measures for optical centers.|`|8f88988d153997a17a65bb17a47f9839aa	go for a full frame with 1.74 seiko lenses, it would come out nicely. <br>  <br>  Otherwise go for a glass 1.9 zeiss latern lenses.<br>  <br>  Oh.. with the poly lens, imagine this craccccccccck........ when you try and clean it with the wrong material or expose it to alcohol LOL
5iQO45ZNaa	i have braces too and the dentist recommended oral b vitality because when you get braces your gums tend to swell up a bit and this massages them so they don't swell.|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	get a Waterpik. those things are great for braces.|`|WjGX7URaaa	Any Tooth Brush is good really.|`|fQ881MwBaa	yes, use my dong. or you can try the colgate power spin|`|djgpu2qNaa	Oral-B Advance Power<br>  I would strongly recommend a WaterPik as well.
jdRKZe18aa	I would definately go back to the doctor.  Maybe you need an eye specialist and this doctor is missing something that is more complicated that he isn't technically able to see, notice or handle.<br>  Is he an optician, an optomitrist or the best choice, an opthalmologist?<br>  I know I have to see an opthalmologist for my specific eye issues - the other less educated eye doctors are fine if there is nothing out of the ordinary with your eyes - so maybe your doctor just isn't seeing a bigger problem or issue you have.  YOU shouldn't be having headaches like this.|`|CtgBMZewaa	omg, i had that too...after a few weeks i brought it back, found out they scured up the pupillary distance, and messed my glasses up...also i know anti-glare really helps headaches....

35cyAIdlaa	There is no real straight answer to your question but I'm gonna try. Well first of all germs are everywhere when ever you touch anything you pick up germs there is really nothing you can do about it. Usually when you touch something you pick up allot of germs and that is why they are so hard to get off because we haven't discovered a really effective non harmful way of removing them from you skin. You could wash your hands with rubbing alcohol but that would probably do more harm then good.
u8CFwtyMaa	I don't look my age, and my son had to carry his passport with him into his mid 20's.<br>  I know it's a pain when you're young, but don't knock it - you'll be grateful for it in 20years time.<br>  Hope this helps|`|yU2WHyvgaa	There's nothing wrong with that. in fact some people find it extremely cute.<br>  grow a beard or something if you want to look older|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	I know this sounds cliche, but you should be grateful that you look young. You look young because you still have a lot of baby fat on your face. You could be skinny and still have baby fat on your face. If I was you I wouldn't worry about it. As you get older you will lose that baby fat. I was the same way in high school up until I turned 21. Then my face started to thin out. Don't wish for your face too thin out too soon. After that happens you start to get wrinkles. Just be glad you have good genes that keep you looking young. <br>  <br>  BTW, if you want to lose the baby fat on your face just lose about 10 LBS through dieting or reducing your calories intake or even doing a lot of cardio exercises. However, I wouldn't recommend this if you want to keep your youthful appearance. <br>  <br>  I don't think you will get many negative comments in college. Most people are really self-absorbed and too busy to even notice other people.|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	Get over the insecurity and be thankful.

(I'm 20 and I still can't do that full beard thing.)  Get a tan.  A tan always helps.  I go tanning all the time.  If you're under 18 you gotta get consent from the parental units but it's no big deal.  Short hair.  When I was 17 I cut almost all my hair off and my sister said I could pass for 21.  I even had a little acne.  So the shorter your hair, the older you'll prolly look.|`|6eROUvT1aa	aww i have a baby face as well, i was in a shop earlier and the women who served me was asking me how school was she said i looked about 13, i'm 17 as well, so i know how you feel, no-one really comments on things like that so don't worry mate. good luck with college ;)|`|wQz9qybgaa	Okay my boyfriend had the same problem <br>  So what he did is he just started shaving his face which cut any hair that was there and then made it grow back and he just kept doing it, it takes some time so I would start now|`|SS5py9jIaa	Meah, don't worry about the little things.

AA10450066	Yes, it reduces the cramps, and about the tampon use with a tampon in why? There may be a possibility of the pressure of it causing big time problems. I wouldn't recommend it.
ufgv7oTjaa	Truth be told, any answer given here will just be personal opinion (I can give you my opinion if you'd like). There are many higher quality companies out there that are readily available and well priced... just make sure the company has a good rating with either the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or USP (U.S. Pharmacopoeia), as those are the main quality assurance organizations (USP is for the U.S., GMP is for the U.S. and worldwide).<br>  That being said, any good quality digestive enzyme complex that has at least a good 5 enzymes or more would be good. They typically should be taken before a meal or at least in the beginning of the meal. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|mSjglSI6aa	You should do both digestive enzymes and probiotics.  What we do is take an enzyme pill with each meal.  We also take a probiotic pill in the morning 15 minutes before eating.  We noticed improvement in those who were having digestive problems almost immediately.  <br>  <br>  The brand we prefer is Natural Factors.  The probiotic is called Protec.

Z5vvgPnOaa	If you have a fever then you probably have an infection. The fever is the body's way of fighting the infection. If you are feeling uncomfortable from the fever, you should take something like ibuprofen or paracetamol. <br>  <br>  SInce you have had a fever since Friday, I think you need to go to the doctor - you may have a bacterial infection which would require antibiotics. A fever from a viral infection should start to go away after about 4 days.

OsT64mqMaa	It is very unlikely it's a disease or anything wrong with you. He probably is a little big, he you are just stretching. It's normal, and it's going to cause little rips and bleeding.|`|dpgXzMenaa	It's probably either deep penetration when hitting your cervix at speed (this can cause very tiny tears and/or bleeding bruises) or not enough lubrication.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar).<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs" (how totally do you trust him with your life?).|`|1m769wGqaa	I think that before having sex with anyone  condom should be used. Now a days you can not trust anyone no matter how much you think you love them. Your health and body are too precious for you to loose over  night. Even if he pulls out before an orgasm you can still expose yourself to harmful diseases. <br>  <br>  however for the bleeding there are serveral things tat could have caused it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cervical dysplasia: Cervical dysplasia is precancerous changes of the epithelial cells that line the cervix. Risk increases with multiple sexual partners, sex before age 18, childbirth before age 16, or a past history of STDs. Treatment is usually cryosurgery or conisation.<br>  <br>  Chlamydia: A bacterial infection that is usually transmitted through sexual activity or contact with semen, vaginal fluid, or blood.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Gonorrhea: A usually sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacteria. Several pharmaceutical treatments are available.<br>  <br>  Vaginitis or Cervicitis: Inflammation or swelling and infection of the vagina or cervix. Treatment depends on the cause.<br>  <br>  Cervical polyps: Cervical polyps are smooth, red or purple, finger-like growths that grow out of the mucus layer of the cervix or the cervical canal. Cervical polyps are extremely fragile, extending out of the cervix, and easily and painlessly removed.<br>  <br>  Trichomoniasis: A usually sexually transmitted disease caused by protozoan. Can also be passed to newborns during vaginal birth by infected mothers. Although rare, transmission is also possible in tap water, hot tubs, urine, on toilet seats, and in swimming pools. May cause vaginitis.<br>  <br>  Vaginal Yeast Infection: An overgrowth of the normal fungi that inhabits the vaginal area. Common symptoms include itching, burning, and an odorless, white, cheese-like discharge.<br>  <br>  Endometritis or adenomyosis: Endometritis is defined by Dorland's Medical Dictionary, 27th Edition as an inflammation of the endometrium (the innermost layer of the uterus). Both conditions are associated with endometriosis. Adenomysis is when endometrial tissue attaches itself to the uterus, or another organ such as the ovaries, and grows outside of the uterus.<br>  <br>  Uterine polyps: Uterine polyps occur when the endometrium overgrows causing these protrusions into the uterus. It is extremely rare for these growths to grow in a way that is either benign or malignant. Women with uterine polyps frequently experience bleeding between periods (metrorrhagia), other symptoms includes vaginal bleeding after sex, spotting, menorrhagia, bleeding after menopause, and breakthrough bleeding during hormone therapy. Hysteroscopic-guided curettage is the preferred treatment, since the normal D&C is basically an unguided procedure that may miss many of the uterine polyps.<br>  <br>  Fibroid tumors: Uterine fibroid tumors are usually benign tumors. They are solid masses made of fibrous tissue. Fibroid tumors are rarely malignant. Symptoms of fibroid tumors vary among women, with some women never experiencing any symptoms at all. Women who can wait until menopause will see their fibroids shrink and disappear once their bodies stop producing estrogen. It's important that women with fibroids make sure they never take estrogen, in any form including birth control pills, since estrogen increases fibroid growth. Several treatments are currently available for uterine fibroid tumors from myomectomy and uterine artery embolization to the traditional hysterectomy.<br>  <br>  <br>  there are other causes as well, but these are the top reasons. The best thing you can do is see your GYN just to be sure.
XkmqZ07Daa	You need some more lean protein.Low fat cheese, lean turkey breast, chicken breast.|`|atn30lRPaa	try smaller meals more often more like snacks every 2 hours|`|w0ZDe89Laa	I don't see much of a difference in the two but I'd say eat the first one. You'll be happier eating good stuff that's good. But eat throughout the day if possible...it's much better to eat maybe 5 small meals than 3 big ones. eat 3 larger meals for typical breakfast, lunch, and dinner but take a little away from each and make 2 more smaller meals in between so all 5 are pretty even but you still have a bit of a line between the 3 meals and snack time.|`|cdaae96Yaa	The second one is healthier.|`|8MQZz17Baa	so, i do that sometimes too=/<br>  and hwat ive notcied is that if you drink something, you usually start to be less hungry. if you eat a larger lunch, and just suffer through that hunger for a few days, it usually goes away. chewing gum helps too=]|`|h2jCnfW8aa	okay for breakfast, you should either continue eating what you're eating, or eat some eggs, but only eggwhites.<br>  for lunch, you should probably eat a turkey breast sandwich w. lettuce, tomato, try not to use mayo. a sandwich i really like is turkey breast, a little salt and pepper, lettuce, roasted red peppers, onions if you want, and some balsamic vinegar instead of a dressing, because dressings are usually very fatty.<br>  for a snack, you should probably eat some fruit or a yogurt with granola, like you said.<br>  for dinner, a salad with chicken or salmon is good, try to use a thin dressing like balsamic vinaigrette or some sort of vinegar.<br>  for desert, DO NOT EAT FRUIT. fruit sits in your stomach as lard when you go to sleep. i recommend either eating nothing, or eating some very light cookies. if you're eating girl scout cookies, eat only 2-4.<br>  <br>  the best thing to do, to start off your day, would eat some fruit along with the oatmeal in the morning, so you can burn it off throughout the day. eating splenda IS NOT GOOD. you're better off using some natural cane sugar if you REALLY need to use a sweetener.

V0Vj564Jaa	is he checking for irritable bowel syndrome or irritable bowel disease? there is a difference. i have crohn's disease and i just had a ct scan done to be sure there were not any pockets of infection above my stricture(where they could not get the scope through with my colonoscopy). so i guess if there is actual infection or inflamation, then they would be able to see that with a ct scan.|`|3sriJtSkaa	yes and no, CT scans allow the doctor to see soft tisue, so any inflammation that is caused as a result of the IBS would show up as an abnormality in the tissue in that area. A CT scan won't "detect" IBS but it can let the doc see the really telltale symptoms that allow them to more confidently diagnose it.|`|4d30bae197e9f26ea7d5a4f3dbb92048aa	Doctors usually will do a colonoscopy to determine whether or not you have this disease.

Either your system is just finicky, or you got unlucky genetics, or any number of possible causes.<br>  <br>  However, your doctor will probably order some tests to make sure you don't have any bleeding in your bowel, you don't have an impaction or similar, and you don't have Crohn's or another more serious disorder.<br>  <br>  All I needed was an X-ray and a few quick, minimally invasive tests.

They really can't help of they do not know what is going on. Let them know what affect the bullying is having on you. <br>  <br>  Try not to 'back talk' (easier said than done - I know). Parents hate this. If you can show that you are listening to them they might make the time to listen to you. It is important to have a dialogue, where all views are aired.<br>  <br>  Tell your teachers you are being bullied. They have a responsibility for you whilst you are in the school and if bullying is going unnoticed it is quite clear they are not doing their jobs effectively.<br>  <br>  Talk to a friend - someone else's perspective might shed some light on possible solutions.<br>  <br>  Contact the Samaritans/Childline or other helplines.<br>  <br>  Killing yourself is so not the answer.<br>  <br>  Remember we all get frustrated sometimes and it is hard to put your pain into perspective but you really must. As much as no one can ever know how something really makes us feel, we must remember, there are so many people suffering a much worse fate than us.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you fgeel a little better.<br>  <br>  If none of the above work, go for a jog and use the anger that you feel to push yourself. <br>  <br>  Failing that - have a good cry!<br>  <br>  Good luck.xxx

Your vaginal labia are the way your genetics put you together. Not sure what you mean by a "Stretched vagina lip", but you labia are they way your are. <br>  Stop worrying.

mjC5XldXaa	Did he grind it down because it felt like you were hitting it too hard when you chewed on it?  It is possible that he could have taken too much off and now the tooth is shorter. It's not probable but is possible.  The bite is usually checked with a piece of carbon paper called articulating paper and this shows marks on the tooth when you bite down and chew around on your teeth.  The dentist tries to make the crown so the bite is even with the rest of the teeth.  If indeed he took too much off and you don't have the crown re-done, the tooth with the crown may grown in (erupt) some more over a period of time until it makes contact with the opposing teeth it bites against.|`|oDqdqLyNaa	Yeah it  could. I was having work done and I couldn't open bags of crisps with my front teeth any more as the mouth didn't close enough :)|`|30xRk9EUaa	haha yea
IMPvzBk1aa	Use normal saline to leanse the burns and apply triple antibiotic ointment.  Cover it with non stick gauze and continue repeating this until they heal over.|`|MyUi3Blyaa	It is a bad thing because the risk of infection increases. You need a good ointment for the pain and keep it as dry as possible to promote healing. It shouldn't hurt for more than a day or two.|`|AA10260921	It sounds like the burns might have blistered.<br>  It depends on the severity of the burns to distinguish how long the pain will last and whether it'll scar or not.<br>  <br>  If it persists for awhile, have a doctor take a look at it.
ItJzrvQ4aa	brewing yeast. It has a lot of vitamin B, too. It will make you gain<br>  weight in a week. Either buy at pharmacies, as supplement, or in any<br>  place which specializes in brewing. Three pills a day/three tablespoons a<br>  day - depends on the product, and you are there. Good for bones and<br>  hair as well.|`|nzxwvZx0aa	Try lifting weights. Rather than put on nasty fat, put on muscle and fill-out
se27sAUwaa	Try not to over stress b/c it's not going to help, if anything it will cause you to have an irregular cycle. Being very active can cause you to be irregular also. <br>  <br>  Normally girls don't get their period until they stop growing, or more accurately when they're hip bones "cap off". I had this same problem and after seeing my doctor she decided to give an xray to check on my pelvic area. Strangely enough we discovered I was capped off. They also ran a blood test to check for any imbalances, which I also had. Now the imbalance will def. mess up your period. At the time it wasn't too bad so I was prescribed birth control pills which regulated my hormones and thus induced my period. Also, if you have PCOS (Polycycstic ovarian syndrome) you can have irregular periods. In my opinion you should probably start on birth control, it can't hurt and you should be starting it once you get your period anyway; especially if you plan on being sexually active (whether mom knows it or not).<br>  <br>  So - basically, get your heiny over to your doctor and explain your situation. If she brushes it off then you need to explain that your very concerned about it and would feel better if he/she tried to find the cause. You're either not ready or imbalanced.|`|oVOaaEJnaa	I think the swimming and your size could be holding your periods back a bit but i'm sure you'll be fine soon. If your still worried in a few months and there is still no sign of them then go and see your doctor. If your developing fine in other areas then this is another reason not to worry.|`|kvIDcbBiaa	You should most certainly get this check out.  Being really thin can stop you from having your period. If you're a healthy weight, then exercising shouldn't stop it.  It could be an internal problem as well, like cysts.  For your well being, please look into this.|`|gYv1XUwzaa	Deary me, there is no need to worry. Irregular periods are sooo fricking common theres nothing to worry about. Its different for different girls. Ull get one soon|`|9MxlhuXzaa	Yes, swimming and exorcise can affect your period. I suggest you talk to a doctor about your concerns. They will be able to answer all of your questions.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	When I was about that age I missed mine for 3 months and then after that they were always irregular.

It's a normal to have an irregular period at first, but it's not normal to have missed it for 6 months|`|y2nC8BUGaa	you should ask your doctor about it.  15 is kind of old to be getting your first period.  You may need to go on birth control to regulate your period.  I had very irregular periods for the first 3 years and my doc had to put me on the pill to regulate it because she said if I don't get it on a regular schedule while I'm young I might never be able to get pregnant.  See your doctor and if they say you're fine you won't have to worry.|`|AA11364723	Yes, periods can be irregular when you first start, but you should still be getting one every month - just different lengths of time apart such as 28 days, 30 days, etc.  The fact that you haven't had one in 6 mos. is a concern.  Perhaps you should have your mom take you to the dr. just to make sure you're ok.  You may just be underweight.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	if you are very athletic, your periods will probably not be normal<br>  plus the fact that you are still young. periods take time to become regular. <br>  if your are worried, see a gyno. when i was a teen i had the same problem and they put me on birth control, which made my periods regular. you may want to check into that :)|`|BO28Mn8haa	well i guess in six months you would have noticed if you were pregnant... so maybe just talk to your doctor. why'd you wait six months to decide this was a problem?
08Vk3RtJaa	drink lots of water, and keep drinking it, this will thin out the mucus making it loose and easier to cough up and out, don't swallow it as this will make you feel nauseous.

We had to add this thickening stuff to her drink because if we didn't she'd choke and it'd go straight to her lungs...maybe that's a choice?  As far as wanting to take the pill; for one, the pills are VERY tiny you could get some applesauce or yogurt and get some on a spoon poke the pill in there and just "gump"...should work...if not they make a Nuva ring which is birth control but it's in you vagina and you change it every month, that way you dont have to take a pill...do whatever one your most comfortable with, but I think the yogurt/applesauce trick will work.  You could try that first and then if it doesn't work give a call back to your doctor and get the ring; they should have no problem with this.  Discuss both options to your doctor and see which one is right for you|`|3dT7f39maa	crush it up and eat it with some bread, I have G.A.D(general Anxiety Disorder) and one of the symtoms is not been able to swallow it properly, and thats what the doctor says to me, although some tablets are slow release, so they HAVE to be swallowed whole, just ask your doc.|`|BfgB6l8Qaa	Does it matter what size the tablet is because my sister is the same age as you and she is on the pill and the tablets are absalutley tiny and easy to swallow she says. If not, i hear that if you put your head facing the floor and swallow it with water like that it helps. But im not sure about that. Or put the tablet to the back of your tongue and drink alot of water. I hope this helps|`|J48UJBlsaa	im glad i found someone like me because im 16 and im sure u know the ibuprophen tablets the small ones....well i have to chew them up i cant even vut them in half...what am i gonna do whenver i get older?? and meat is the same way to...i have to chew it up until there is like nothing left...dont worry im the same way and i dont know what we can do :(|`|t1qfuTqqaa	I have found that sometimes putting a pill in either a spoonful of yogurt or applesauce can help with swallowing them.
qfSKgxDsaa	That definitely sounds like you're pregnant, go get another test.  If that one's neg. go see your doctor to get some medicine to help you feel better, and maybe get a pregnancy test done there, that one is for sure right!|`|Z4Y0tHOxaa	omg that was me a few weeks ago!!! like totally off my food, turned out that i was really anaemic, i mean i've been anaemic before, but nothing as bad as this. i had headaches, body weakness, soooooo dizzy, i thought i was dying!!! i'm a normal girl in england so how the hell can i be malnourished?! after taking alot of multi vitamins, i forced myself to eat for strength, mild outdoor exercise, and i deliberately overslept. and i cut out processed food, i think my body didn't like that artificial stuff. i feel so much better. <br>  <br>  i hope u feel better soon hun
08Vk3RtJaa	not that I know of, dementia is a progressive deterioration of brain function.  Many medications could have side effects that affect memory or cause confusion which may seem like dementia but these symptoms should cease with a change in medication.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, some medications can.  Especially in older people who may not be able to clear the meds from their system as quickly.|`|cQMWB6S0aa	ALL medications have some type of side effects.

08Vk3RtJaa	If your body is trying to fight an infection such as the flu it has to work hard and therefore rest is quite important.  If you are still participating in practice your body is putting all it's energy into your cheerleading and doesn't have the energy to fight the infection as well.  Be a bit kind to yourself and rest a bit, drink lots of water and eat small healthy meals, take any medication your doctor gave you.  Try to take it easy for about 3-5 days and you will give your body time to recover.|`|IeRO44RWaa	The flu can take a couple of weeks to get over. You really just need to rest, drink lots of water, get plenty of vitamin C, eat fruits and vegetables.
ZjhQ6PL8aa	It's tough to figure out your friends situation.  She either really is pregnant and is just starting to show or possibly has ascites.  The biggest cause of ascites is cirrhosis caused by alcohol.  There are many other things that can cause this though from a virus to heart failure.  My guess would be she should go see her personal doctor so they can run some blood/urine work on her.  While I don't personally think an ER is necessary this isn't really something I'd wait for to get worse, it's better to nip it in the bud now rather then wait and have worse problems.|`|F08HDRvraa	If she gets short of breath she should go to the hospital immediately.  Congestive heart failure can cause retention of fluid and swelling of the ankles, legs and stomach.  This can be a life threatening condition.

I suggest, if you can, you pick something simple to maintain like reading while tapping the page or humming, something which is physical which doesn't interfere with your inner reading voice.<br>  <br>  However, what would be easier is to seek help to combat your OCD, but I know that's easier said than done.|`|3sriJtSkaa	I have ADD and I would describe ADD as quite similar to what you're referring to as OCD. <br>  Get some adderall and I'm pretty sure it'll clear your "OCD" right up :-)

This is more for the safety of the computer itself because the fan that keeps the inside of the computer cool is located on the bottom. And if it's covered and not allowed to be filtered then it will back up in the computer itself and it will cause it to overheat and eventually the computer won't work anymore. That sucks! I use a laptop as well and for a long time I used to literally keep it on my lap and it used to get really hot. Now I use a cooler for my laptop which helps it to last long and work better. Health wise, it's known that if you keep a laptop anywhere on your body for to long of a time, blocking the fan and heating up the computer itself, will cause possible burns and damage to your skin! OUCH! So it's best to keep it off of you in general. But up to 30 minutes would be fine.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Laptops do not cause cancer!<br>  <br>  However, if you rest your laptop on your stomach or, oddly enough, in your lap, be sure that you do not block the vents!  The air must circulate freely to keep the electronics cool; this is very important!|`|y8HyP1bzaa	That's crazy.  In fact, I'm sitting here with my laptop on my lap right now!|`|EK3nwsAcaa	not that i know of however i dont think the internet connection will be too good for you|`|RKLFYS2Naa	omg..she's really psycho...look online..it says there is no chance of getting cancer whatsover...duh!
7GnY2RTDaa	haha im scared to turn 20 in a month!! I already have noticed small wrinkles in my forehead that definitely werent there a year ago and its freaking me out.<br>  <br>  I guess thats what Botox is for!!|`|WMR8hVlfaa	o.O<br>  <br>  25 is not old at all. I'll be 25 in less than four years and I'm not scared at all. I'm assuming you're pretty young, so 25 might seem like old to you.. but it isn't at all. Considering the average lifespan of a woman is 75 years, that's only a third of your life. And many women live much longer. I'm excited to see how my life unfolds. Hopefully by 25 I'll finally be out of school and actually starting a career!<br>  <br>  And if this has something to do with looks... all I can say is the sooner you let go of your shallow obsessions, the sooner you'll find happiness. Stop wearing makeup. Don't worry about wrinkles... they're proof that you have LIVED! It makes me so sad that some people go as far as to inject chemicals into themselves just so they can "stay young". You all look like robots.|`|sPT8ikgXaa	You are only as old as you think you are.  Trust me, when you get to 25, you are going to realize that you are not aging, and realize you are just beginning to have fun :)  25 is a good age.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Don't worry about it, we all get older every year, life does not stop at 25!<br>  (a little secret...just between you and me. I am more than twice that age..... and having a great time)<br>  Chill, relax and enjoy life!|`|HB3fDXeMaa	haha, I felt the exact same way when I turned 25 and now Im going to be 26 soon....what Ive learned is that there's nothing to worry about as long as you exercise and eat healthy, you can be biologically younger than 25 - its true there's a book about it. Plus, Ive learned that the difference between 25 and say 23 is really not much. You're responsibilities are pretty much the same in your twenties (unless you get married or have a kid or something). I find mid to late twenties is when you start to seriously want the big assets in life like a commited relationship/paid off debts/house/car/career.....and lots of travelling and stylish parties or clubs. Drinking to get stupid/messy/puke drunk has lost it je ne sais quoi type of fun a long time ago (at least for me and my friends) but drinking just enough to get silly with maybe a small hang over is always great :)|`|16763282a55581feffcd70f2d7521b79aa	Keep this in mind..... your not old until you reach 89 :) . But before then *at 21-25* your just *WE* are just maturing adults. So really there is nothing to be scared about unless you talked to a psychic that has a 100% success rate and said something terrible is going to happen to you when you turn 25??? If not then don't worry! lol|`|B6ioLtejaa	I wish I could be 25 again. I got so much poon tang back then...<br>  Anyhow I degress. It is all downhill after 25. Do yourself a favor and kill yourself now. I am now 28 and all I do is sit around the nursing home complaining about my arthritis and watching reruns of Matlock. Oh to be young again.<br>  Good Luck Granny.|`|3GawX2Y7aa	I've just turned 30 and am happier now than I've ever been, I enjoyed my 20's but you're still learning a lot, now at 30 I feel more mature, and secure in job, relationships etc but still not too old to have fun and party!!|`|bx4R7wagaa	nahhh...at 25 society begin to treat you more seriously and more profesional not like a inmature rebel,,,I'll be 22 this year and I feel super duper...|`|c89r4C9aaa	umm why would i be scared?

ZA5QTj3Zaa	There are different degrees of depression.  If someone is just starting to go into a downward cycle, they may be able to express this through words or actions.  I don't think it makes you more creative but if you already are, then it provides a lot of material for you to work with.  People, in general, tend to focus on the bad so it is easier to write about everything that is wrong then write about happy days.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't say creative people like to stay depressed, they might be more in tune with their emotions and be able to interpret what they are feeling and use it in their art instead of just getting over it and going on with their lives.<br>  <br>  Depressed people will find it hard to make connections with people and so will become distant and non-sociable.  So this may make people turn away from them.  Plus anger may arise from people always trying to do something about their depression when they really just want to be left alone.<br>  <br>  I think people who are insane are more creative.|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	People who are depressed are often very creative. For example, Vincent Van Gogh was thought to suffer from depression. <br>  <br>  I've found that many people say they lose their creativity when they lose the depression, but sometimes it's a price you have to pay. I used to write poetry when I was at my most depressed, but looking back at it, it wasn't very good anyway. I'd take the stable life I have now over a few more pages of depressed poetic junk<br>  <br>  Lastly: It's extremely common for someone who is depressed to think that nobody cares about them.|`|tHwK0gdFaa	Some people that are in creating... Like Artists, musicians, poets etc. need something to inspire them. Depression is a very deep feeling, when you are really depressed, not just upset, you start thinking in a different way. And everything you say, or think of is kind of a mirror image of real you. When you are depressed it's easier to put your soul on paper, or into music...|`|8rwxS60Eaa	It's a way to vent. To let your thoughts wander and sort of get it out of your system. People arent neccesarily more creative, they just need distraction.<br>  <br>  Also when theyre finished with a song or a drawing or whatever, its a comfort if it turned out alright. Like an accomplishment. <br>  Makes them feel a bit better about themselves aswell.|`|ems2NJ46aa	with depression i always felt empty and blank, i couldn't create because there was nothing inside me.  i definitely create much much better when i'm in good form :)

CoiXzwKHaa	Yes I got them and they r amazzzing!!<br>  I wanted a thin pad that absorbed the blood and the smell and this was it<br>  I felt so dry<br>  I got the overnight ones so they were even more obsorbent and they didn't leak during gym or gymnastics<br>  Don't worry about the price because it really pays off because now I don't have to ruin al of my undies and pants :)|`|I40iBJdHaa	they are AWESOME! try them! best pad i've ever tried and they are really thin|`|se27sAUwaa	Uhm.. Tampons are not "much better and cleaner". You are def. misinformed. Tampons should not be your only fem. product b/c you are more at risk for TSS (toxic shock syndrome). On top of that you should never wear tampons if you do not have your period and always change them every 4-8 hours or when leaking. Also, make sure you pick the appropriate absorbency. High absorbency tampons may be associated with an increased risk of TSS (as per FDA). Vaginal dryness and ulcerations can occur when women use a tampon that is too absorbent for their menstrual flow. (Ok - even I didn't know that, lol). Most women use tampons during they day and pads at night, which is reccomended. They advise you not to sleep with a tampon in b/c you may sleep more than 8 hours. <br>  <br>  And just think of this: Your menstural cycle is a cleansing cycle. Your body is shedding skin, blood, etc. You are putting a wadded up peice of cotton "up there" and completely blocking all that "stuff" from exiting your body. Which is exactly why the FDA tells you not to constantly wear tampons. Yes, used appropriately they can be safe and effective. BUT - if you are undereducated you could be doing your body harm without even knowing it. <br>  <br>  In aswer to your question... I don't know. LOLOL  You're really going to have to try out a few brands to see which is the best for you. Go online and check out some the brands your interested in. Most of the time you can get free samples sent to your home so you can try before you buy.|`|RqT3QFajaa	Yes They work very well. They have super absorbency and they are very thin with wings. I think you should try it because they are great. They have like little holes in them so they can absorb the blood, and te pad is thin and comfortable. You can't even feel it and you feel dry too.<br>  <br>  Try It!|`|NNwEuC8paa	Yeah they do. But tampons are much better! and cleaner!

xO1LQWbZaa	I've been in karate long enough to know broken ribs.  What I did, I went to the doctor, and he told me that I broke a rib.  It hurt when I inhaled, and moved.  I was 15 when that happened, now I'm 17, but I put ice packs and heat packs on and relaxed for a few weeks.  If he doesn't take a break and relax and let the break heal, it could make the healing process much more brutal and extremally painful anirreversiblele damage and possible healing thaisn'tnt how it's normal shape was.Unfortunatelyly, their is nothing that can be done really for ribs but to relax.  <br>  <br>  Hope your husband gets better!!  Good luck, and hope isn't too bad.|`|AA10260921	I think at this point he should be seen by a medical professional.<br>  He needs to have an X-Ray.|`|hBmafVYoaa	He needs to get an Xray. It's really important to do that,
GBG2hbQ4aa	The truth of all this is that the one person you can count on is yourself.  So you educate yourself in order to provide yourself with the best possible care.  <br>  <br>  I have had some heavy duty health problems, most of which did not show with any of the standard testing ....tests just come back 'within normal ranges'.  There are many physical problems that in fact do not show up on the tests available.  The tests themselves fall short....either they are not sensitive enough to measure the problem or they are not measuring what needs to be measured.  <br>  <br>  As for your fear that your doctors and the labs are out to get you....that would be your paranoia talking.  That your doctor has been unable to diagnose what is wrong simply means he does not have the knowledge base to figure it out.  More and more health problems are showing up that many doctors are unable to identify, let alone treat.  These health problems are coming from dietary and environmental toxins...areas most doctors are not trained in.  <br>  <br>  There are a handful of doctors around the country that are, in fact, educated in this area.  They practive what is called 'environmental medicine'.   I've worked with an environmental allergist....he's great.<br>  <br>  Check in your area for this type of physician.  If you cannot find a doctor in the yellow pages under environmental medicine, check with the local health food store to see if they happen to have a list of physicians.|`|afkygHMgaa	LOL find me somene who trusts the establishment and I will show you a liar.

lgPMTgbWaa	Often people who say so may be being selfish by calling someone so in pain to kill themselves selfish for not sticking around for them...just a thought.<br>  <br>  Yes, i suppose suicide is hard to justify, but only former suicidal people who have experienced another person's suicide can really make this decision, i think. It's easy to sit happily by a  computer screen and judge when one hasn't experienced such intense pain.<br>  <br>  Suicide is not cowardly. I saw this one sight that summed it up well...i think the person said something about how emotionally people are being weighed down, and if physically someone had weights constantly thrown on them, they would want to stand up but couldn't...or something like that, and it has nothing to do with character.<br>  <br>  Some theories, like the Theory of Positive Disintegration, have feeling suicidal as a...almost as a "step to enlightenment." Wiki has a nice article, since i probably am not making any sense....<br>  <br>  Suicide is a last resort. Most suicidal people feel utterly hopeless, like the world is completely empty and there is no reason to live...one COULD consider this selfish, but feelings are real, selfish or not.|`|C8u2jBu7aa	i do not quite say selfish, but i do say it is the action of a coward. my uncle did that, and i saw what it did to my family. thinking back, i may say selfish....|`|oiNkygNtaa	no its not selfish.|`|Z19gRYZwaa	Selfish in that they benefit from it and others are hurt, yes. Selfish in the sense that it makes the person who did it selfish, or is indicative of selfish intent, not necessarily. I can completely see how, having lost someone you love for a reason you don't understand, you would see it as the world's most selfish thing to do. However, I can personally guarantee that in terms of actual motivation, not all people who are suicidal are thinking only about themselves. Depression can make you believe things anyone else would find crazy. I think that If you genuinely believe that everyone around you hates you, that your existence causes nothing but harm to the people you care about, then suicide is not *motivated* by selfishness, despite being a selfish act. As orangerose said, I think you would have to have been on both sides to make a fair judgment.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	No as a person who tried to commit suicide at the age of 8 I know that I wasn't trying to end my life but to end the PAIN that I was in. I knew what death was I'd lost a brother to death already that wasn't what I wanted what I wanted was to end the pain I"ve been in.  The only way that I could think of to end the pain was to commit suicide that way I knew that the pain would end. So no I don't think of suicide as being selfish because I know that most people don't want to kill themselves but to end the pain.  There is a big difference that most people don't understand.|`|Vzzc6mATaa	When someone walks under a train the line has to be closed for two hours the one that hit them and all others nearby have to stop this can effect 100''s the driver may have to take time off to get over it. <br>  <br>  Seeing who jumped a roof dead in the street is not a nice thing to see<br>  <br>  Finding somone hanging  is somthing you never get over|`|TyiPJwsMaa	Yes it is.I don't think someone who does it realizes the amount of embarassment it can cause to the family.|`|teptsmeKaa	I personally do not believe that suicide is an intentionally selfish act.<br>  In a sense, yes it is a selfish act... taking your own life because you can't deal with the pain.<br>  Then again, it's only viewed selfish because everyone that is left behind from the person that died becomes sad/angry/upset. Everyone asks "Why?", so then again, maybe it's more selfish to think suicide is selfish.<br>  The person who kills themself is usually in so much dead end pain that they feel they cannot escape. Usually under the impression the world would be better off without them. Thus in their eyes being better for everyone else for them to stop burdening others, so then it wouldn't be selfish... But a last resort for peace of mind and for others.<br>  Even if that's not the case.<br>  Suicide isn't really selfish or unselfish in my opinion. It is an act drawn out by those with preceived unbearable pain. The last thing anyone feeling that way wants to be told, is that they are selfish.<br>  Is it really selfish to want the pain to stop after so long? <br>  Yes there are better ways people say, some people don't realise they have another way though. People should learn to be more empathic, and stop being selfish themselves.<br>  In suicide, everyone can be selfish.<br>  The person that attempted or did it, and the person that got mad or felt guilty the person tried or did it. They are both just as selfish.<br>  It's a matter of emotion and the individual.|`|3sriJtSkaa	yes. I think suicide is selfish. I have lost 3 people to suicide and here is probably the number one thing I would have said to them to convince them not to;<br>  <br>  Think of your mother, think of how much she went through to have you and love you and bring you thusfar through life. Imagine the pain she would feel at losing you and spending every day for the rest of ehr life thinking about what she could ahve done, how she could have helped and where she went wrong. Imagine her laying in bed every night crying herself to sleep at the thought of the amount of pain you must have been in to do something like that and then try to rationalize that ending your pain is more important. Tell me how you can possibly believe that your pain is worse that all the combined pain of every person who blames themself for having not known, or having not been able to stop you. <br>  If you look at it like that, yes, suicide is selfish. I look at it like that and I wish I could go back and slap some sense into the 3 I lost. <br>  <br>  either that or go back and fix them, and make them happy and ok again. <br>  <br>  but it doesn't really matter does it? I think most people that commit suicide realize that it's inherently selfish but the point is that by that time they have surpassed all coherent reason.|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	When you're depressed enough to commit suicide, you don't think about anything other than your pain. So in a sense, yes, suicide is very selfish although it's not usually consciously selfish.|`|69ArQ7s6aa	My mother has always told me that suicide was selfish for exactly the reason that you said.

lcuxD3qlaa	I’m a Vegetarian and I’m super thin, and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll ...and I have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  I bareeeely work out ....and I’ve never had a belly, big thighs, or big butt SO Listen k? I'm pretty much perfect; 5'2 96 pounds<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious!

Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!?

aa7925964a8d49ab0be321cad8a35d78aa	The LDL is in the moderate range. The important thing would be if your HDL is up as high as it should be. If it is then you are just borderline and fast foods are very good for raising your LDl. A study just came out showing that people living near a lot of fast food restaurants died earlier than those that didn't. So, there must be a reason. You can eat well at these places, it does cost more. The grilled chicken is about 3 times the dollar menu but it's worth it in the long run. Most of them now have menu's with the nutrition of the food they serve on them. Collect one from all the restaurants you go to and keep it in the car and highlight the good foods and only order those, it will make it easier to keep those numbers down and still allow you to be on the go. Also remember that there are good salad bars in grocery stores now and fruit and nuts and raisins and things like that will also keep your energy up while you are on the go. Good luck. Miss Mary|`|So7lXdBKaa	its your eating habits you eat all high fat and sodium foods and take no excerise|`|6NZeItMAaa	as you grow older you need to eat less or healthier.<br>  <br>  If you go on with those habits you are going to increase your cholesterol  so your should put more atention to what you eat.<br>  <br>   A healthy diet does not mean starvation or tasteless foods. Yet a corrective diet does not mean either starvation or the grim necessity of eating unpalatable foods<br>  <br>  You do not have to lose energy—good diet increases vigor. Neither does it mean a loss of energy or a sharp reduction in poundage, unless you are overweight, in which case the excess fat is melted off. In fact, if you adhere to the low-fat, low-cholesterol diet recommended, you will feel better; have more vigor, and firmer muscles than before. If you have a faulty fat metabolism, the diet may substantially prolong your life.
Z8qBgv8taa	I was around 14 or 15 I think. The thing is though if your flow is that heavy I would advise starting out with an ultra light tampon and a pad and move up in size from there to see what works for you.

She lost so much weight she got very sick, weak, to the point where all she could do was ask me "Am I fat?" Which is my point, you're not. Losing more weight right now is not an option. You should talk to a doctor about the proper weight you should be for your age and height, before you end up on a hospital bed asking passerby if you're fat and getting stares and people wondering "Why does she think that? She's skin and bones!"

xfgVGqvXaa	You may well find that the diazepam helps.  It's better known by its old trade name, Valium, by the way.<br>  <br>  Diazepam comes in 2mg, 5mg and 10mg tablets.  The advice to doctors is that they should start with the 2mg tablet and work upwards if necessary; your doctor seems to have done that.  Although 2mg didn't work for you last time, diazepam is a powerful drug that will work if you are given the right dose.  If someone is having a major crisis and arrives at a psychiatric unit in an incoherent state, they will often be given diazepam.  If it can work for someone like that, it can work for you.  The only problem is working out how much to give you, so you are relaxed but not stupefied.<br>  <br>  It will take fifteen minutes to an hour to take effect.<br>  <br>  There are some local anaesthetics that are absorbed through the gums.  I don't know what would happen if you used one of them before having your injection.  I suspect the needle might go too deep, so you would still feel it.  It could also make things difficult for the dentist, because he wouldn't be able to work out the right dose for the injection.  An example local anaesthetic is lidocaine hydrochloride ointment.  Supposedly you don't even need a prescription, so you could always go to a local chemist's shop and ask the pharmacist whether it would work.  If you try it, email me and tell me what you were told (pete@friendlyfrog.net).  I'm curious now!|`|1aT4rsjraa	I am terrified of the dentist too.  Try going to a sedation dentist.

ItCOMhYGaa	They will numb you up before they take anything out. Dont be afraid, doctors try their best not to hurt you. Just express your fear and ask for full anestesia, or some laughing gas. Or tell the doctor that when he is performing and your hurting, you simply raise your hand and that works as a single for him to go slower in whatever he is doing. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|elY5vkVyaa	Sounds like a root canal treatment; they drill very deep (all the way through the tooth) and cut the bad nerve and sterilise the area to kill the infection. It's hard to say what the chances of success are, sometimes it's as high as 80% and sometimes it's 50% or just 25%. Your dentist will tell you when he or she has had a better look.<br>  <br>  If you do lose your teeth there is the option of implants; they are very expensive (around ￡2000 to ￡3000 each in the UK) but a screw-in implant is permanent and indistinguishable from a real tooth. It's a lot of money but if you can afford it it's worth every penny.|`|8vC8dnvtaa	If they are screwed they will pull them out, front teeth come out easy so dont worry.  They may perform a root cannal and try and save the teeth.|`|tGEMwgyBaa	It sounds like you may have to get root canals on the teeth to save them or if they are really bad you may have to get them taken out. Root Canals sound bad but if you have a good dentist it won't hurt. They will numb you before they start, if you do feel something, tell the dentist and he will numb you some more. After the root canals they will have to crown you teeth so there will be no more further damage to the teeth. Worst case scenario is you have to have them pulled. Then once this is done you will need a flipper or partial made to replace the teeth that were taken out. This is a long process because they have to take impressions of your teeth before they take them out and then you have to have the teeth pulled, then if it's not an immediate partial, you have to wait for the surgery site to heal and then have the partial put in. Another way to go is to have a Bridge done instead of a partial, this is what I would do...its not removable like a partial and it looks more natural. Hopefully you only need the root canals and then the crowns. I know it sounds like a lot but you'll be o.k. either way...Good Luck and I hope this was helpful|`|yEu7nCtBaa	if you have to lose them that means the dentist will give you anaesthetic and take them out. i had four out not so long ago and it isn't as bad as it sounds. it doesn't hurt or anything. just remember the dentist knows best! don't be scared of him! good luck x x|`|FX68tBh6aa	They may put a needle, but  before they will numb it and it will fall out.

(Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|ad6YgqZlaa	you should probably get checked out for STD's|`|XsmPnMU4aa	Sounds to me like you have a leaky verchina.

Once you accept the quote you set up an appointment to be fitted for Invisalign. When that appointment is depends on how busy the orthodontist office is. From the time of the fitting they said it takes about 6 weeks to get them in to the office, when they get the Invisalign trays in they make another appointment with you where they give them to you, show you haw to use them and add any attachments to your teeth if necessary.<br>  <br>  I just got fitted for Invisalign for both my top and bottom teeth.

69ArQ7s6aa	You have legitimate health concerns and should not be embarrassed to consult a doctor or other medical professional. Describe your physical and emotional symptoms to them and they'll be able to help you. Perhaps you can discuss the insomnia and sleep paralysis first and once you have established a rapport with the doctor will be more comfortable discussing the emotional concerns.|`|r8Sme80raa	>"I really am embarrased to see a doctor..."<br>  <br>  So, what do you want?<br>  <br>  I guess it will have to get bad enough for you to seek out a professional.   If you end up in the emergency room imagine how "embarrassed" you'll be.   Then you'll have everyone's attention!|`|eO2rnf7yaa	People become doctors because they want to help people like you.  Tell your doctor.  Everything you are describing is something that calls for medical attention.  Psychotherapy might also be helpful.  I hope you will contact your physician.  <br>  <br>  There's a great book on depression and anxiety written by a psychiatrist.  The title is  "Feeling Good - The New Mood Therapy".  The author is David Burns,  M.D.  It makes a lot of sense, and I think it would be helpful to you.  Ask for it at your public library.  If you are embarrassed to ask about a book on depression, tell the librarian you are thinking of writing an essay on depression for school.   If your library does not own this book,  ask if it can be ordered.  It probably exists someplace in your library system,  and the librarian can figure out how to order it.  If you can't find it,  e-mail me for more information.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, anyone who can be a gymnast at all is someone who has some very powerful inner strength.  That does not mean that I think everything should be easy for you.  I actually mean that even when things are very difficult for you,  that I think you will be able to work your way through things.<br>  <br>  You probably used a coach to help you with gymnastics. Even though it may seem totally different,  I think you should approach your mental health problems the same way.  Get a proper "coach".  In this case the "coach" you need is called a doctor.    I hope you tell your doctor the problems your are having.   Be honest and straightforward.  Ask for a recommendation to a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist.<br>  <br>  I hope you'll ask for help.<br>  Remember that physicians and psychologists are required to keep things confidential.  What you tell that person will be kept private.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|3NjmcjfGaa	maybe you have bipolar disorder|`|izY3JNhqaa	It all has to do with Ascension which began on April 13, 2008 and will be completed by 12/21/2012.  IN the meantime just relax and try not to let things bother you since they are about to get a LOT worse.  <br>  <br>  Eat well ... take calcium, magnesium, zinc pills before bedtime for a relaxing sleep.  Eat raw almonds before bed for awesome dreams.  TRY to get out into nature and just relax with the rest of Nature and stop reading the papers or watching the news until you are strong enough again to handle it.  <br>  <br>  Just my humble opinion.  <br>  <br>  Peace|`|tgCuwPJ5aa	I can't give you much advice as to what to do about eating. I can tell you that everyone does it, and that it's normal. I was bulimic for about a year. I ate normally, and made up for it by spending 5 hours a day on the treadmill, and that's on a light day.<br>  <br>  I've had insomnia before. I don't know if it's making you have trouble sleeping, but trust me, these sorts of episodes are triggered by stress. So I'd recommend just not worrying about it, and just getting some sleep. <br>  <br>  I don't want to sound critical or hurtful, I'm just being blunt. You have a problem. I'm sorry if it's harsh, but with all those symptoms, this isn't something that's going to correct itself. I hate going to the doctor too, and I understand embarrassing and awkward problems. I have severe ADHD, and while not nearly as severe as your problems, i still feel weird going to the doctor and saying "um... i can't concentrate... and it's ruining my life." Doctors hear awkward stories all the time. A doctor has heard all sorts of things. "It burns when I pee." "My vagina feels wrong." Hell, i'm sure they've even heard "I hear voices."<br>  <br>  I know it sucks, but you should really consider going to the doctor. Not only will you feel better, but all of your problems might be symptoms of one serious issue. If it is, things like that can cause severe problems, but only if they're left unchecked. going to the doctor might actually save your life.|`|ZMl3Nvilaa	Im no expert or any thing but I would consider that you see a doctor.
tbbWp18taa	Well, when you play a lot of sports you tend to be a "late bloomer and start later. Trust me, you honestly do not want it.. I know girls say that all the time and i know from experience i didn't listen to them because i really wanted my period.. In all reality periods suck! But yeah, playing sports do cause periods to come later. Oh and if you want to get some more estrogen in your body (to make you period come sooner.. i did this and it worked: eat lots of peanuts, drink lots of milk, and eat soy.<br>  Good Luck|`|BK535teoaa	It depends on the person. Most people get it around the same time their mothers did. So you should maybe try asking her when she got hers. I have always been very skinny, however tall, and i got mine when i was 12.

I heard that being skinny or "underweight" can delay you period.(not saying you are underweight, exactly. Just that you weigh less than whatever "average" is. I did too, its okay.) I wouldn't worry too much about it, but if you do get worried, talk to someone you trust about it. :)  Good luck|`|QJHE3z1raa	Your body type has EVERYTHING to do with it.<br>  Since your super skinny your totally going to get it at 15-16.

I think it works all those muscle groups you named.  Pilates and power yoga also work well for that, I actually have experience with those.  Another thing you may be interested in if you want to use rolling hip movements to work out, is doing stripping for a workout.  I'm not suggesting a career change, but they have classes and DVDs.  I had a book called the S Factor, that was about stripping as a workout.  I tried it, it was a little fun but I didn't find it very effective, maybe because I didn't really get into it (I felt somewhat silly).  But maybe you'll like it, a lot of people do.|`|h3W9JnGBaa	Sure do BUT you must do it for more then 10 minutes and feel "burn"<br>  <br>  Do as many core (abs, stomach etc) exercises untill you cant do it anymore... <br>  <br>  For better results do it EVERY 2 Days and do your exercises for  20-30 minutes a day....<br>  <br>  so variations on exercises like planks and other core exercises (look on google) look for RESISTANCE CORE TRAINING<br>  <br>  If you good meaning you keep to it, you'll see results within months <br>  <br>  Hope it Helps|`|lAmNQBunaa	go to www.fitnessmagazine.com :)<br>  <br>  <br>  you'll find so much information and plenty of free workouts and meal plans and what not there :)

Not to mention everybody thinks medicating yourself to control your PA's is the best thing to do. Ever noticed how many drugs there are on the market today to treat anxiety and PA's? Now stop and think do you really want to put yourself through what can sometimes be a nightmare of the testing and trial and error it takes to find that drug that is just right for you? Some of those meds make you sick as a dog for weeks until your body "adapts" to it. Some even make your problems MUCH worse before they, if ever, make it better. Keep in mind, there are tons of different pills out there used to treat PA's. The number one pills on the market are always the ones whose founders pay the most for marketing. New drugs every year all to treat and age old condition. Very few are ever medical breakthroughs or advancements in medical science and technology. So if you want to guinea pig your body and well-being, go right ahead!<br>  <br>  I suffered alot from them after returning from Iraq. Docs dosed me with every pill under the sun to include highly addictive ones. I finally came across a VERY EFFECTIVE method of controlling them myself DRUG FREE.

I learned to distract myself and do just something to get my mind off of it.  Whether it was doing light housework or singing a song in my head.  After about 10-15 minutes it would pass.

BG8vMyZjaa	The auricle can be easily damaged. Because it is skin-covered cartilage, with only a thin padding of connective tissue, rough handling of the ear can cause enough swelling to jeopardize the blood-supply to its framework, the auricular cartilage. That entire cartilage framework is fed by a thin covering membrane called the perichondrium (meaning literally: around the cartilage). Any fluid from swelling or blood from injury that collects between the perichondrium and the underlying cartilage puts the cartilage in danger of being separated from its supply of nutrients. If portions of the cartilage starve and die, the ear never heals back into its normal shape. Instead, the cartilage becomes lumpy and distorted. Wrestler's Ear is one term used to describe the result, because wrestling is one of the most common ways such an injury occurs. Cauliflower ear is another name for the same condition, because the thickened auricle can resemble that vegetable.<br>  <br>  So if the swelling persists, and you experience any discomfort the best advice would be to see your doctor.|`|FQxbwbtlaa	try and leave it 4 a wil it mit b getin beter but if more pain call doctor and wher a plaster

It is a natural part of the digestive system flora, but must be balanced out by bacteria. Unfortunately, antibiotics kill off the bacteria that keep the candida in check. Once the candida is overgrown, it has a tendency to stay that way.<br>  Candida feeds off of sugars. Not just the simple ones from sweets, but also complex carbs, like wheat bread. Eating a lot of these will allow Candida to proliferate and spread down the path to infest your privates. Funnily enough, the lube is probably making this WORSE, since lube is often glycol-based.<br>  <br>  Candida isn't something most doctors will treat, though. There haven't been enough studies on it, and it's multisystematic, so it presents as dozens of different problems. To really get anywhere, if you think this is your problem, you'll have to speak to a naturalist.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the website I put in the source, and maybe run a google search of your own =].|`|PImvmP1paa	Or you may need to consider getting your partner treated for a yeast infection as well.|`|U8kLyWS1aa	Some peole just produce extra yeast.

dpgXzMenaa	I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when the woman is sexually aroused or when she's sweaty after exercise or having spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Do NOT add sweet things... sugar and vaginas are an unhealthy mix for the woman.  <br>  <br>  Why add anything at all?  It's an amazingly arousing and erotic smell and taste.|`|xmr7W8ndaa	It has been described as an 'ocean' smell - a bit salty.<br>  <br>  As long as the girl is healthy the odor will become a bit musky over the day.  It's not a bad smell, but musky.<br>  <br>  If the odor/taste bothers you - go to a good drug store and get "Wet" sugar free lubricant sold near the condoms.  This stuff has fruit flavors, wont stain the sheets, cleans up well with water and tastes good.  As a part of foreplay, put some on your fingers and tease/massage it into her folds and opening.<br>  <br>  My favorite is "Watermellon" because it is a light scent, but they have apple, cherry, grape and a few others.|`|AA10530965	mine doesnt smell like anything?? i mean absolutely nothing!!|`|brSfRLspaa	sweet n sour sauce|`|I40iBJdHaa	it's so hard to explain! it's more like, it usually has the same smell, but after at the end of the day the smell is just stronger, but that doesn't mean it's 'dirty'. and no chocolate syrup or honey! putting anything with sugar down there can cause infections.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Musky, salty or slightly sweaty.<br>  <br>  Most little boys, and unfortunately rather a lot of grown men, are led to believe the vagina and/or vulva smells of fish. A fishy smell is never normal and is actually caused by an infection.<br>  <br>  Also, as women have different levels of hormones than men, the vulva doesn't usually start to smell strongly for a good few days of not washing. Men need to wash more often because of their testosterone levels. Just a useless piece of info for you.
7f82uwjWaa	Well, that depends on the severity of the hit. If you were to press hard enough directly on your temple then you could knock yourself out, or  you could die by being hit very hard by, for example, a pellet gun or a paint ball. There is a major artery that runs there and flows blood from your heart to your brain. If you hit your temple, you can hit the artery. If you hit the artery, you can stop the blood flow to your brain. If your headache persists then you should set up an appointment  with your doctor to see if you damaged anything. Make sure to tell your doctor when, how, and the severity of your injury. Hope this helps, and that you are ok.|`|XF2vVY3Uaa	Get advice from your doctor. You may need to make an appointment.

It's thinking "Ok, your body is telling me that there is no food coming in, that must mean that there is no food around!" and the brain will initiate several defense mechanisms that will help you to survive without food even though you're trying to do something completely different. The main thing that the brain does is send out chemicals and signals throughout the body to tell the metabolism "Hey, slow down, there's not much food coming in, we need to conserve what food we have left to use for energy." So the metabolism slows down, making it the hardest thing to lose weight. The best way to lose weight is to get into the habit of "grazing" which means you eat little by little as the day goes on, replenishing what was eaten a few hours ago. The body will see the constant flow of small portioned food and start burning it at a moderate pace. With exercise, at least 25-30 minutes of cardio a day, at least 3 times a week, but no more than 5 times a week because exercising constantly can strain the body and not letting the body rest frequently throughout the week, won't let your muscles recover fully, thus not letting you get the results you want when exercising. Now grazing is the best diet anyone can work with because it's 6 small meals a day...I'm not talking about a handful of crackers and milk being a meal...I'm talking about breakfast: bowl of cereal with fiber, take a multi vitamin...3 hours later, snack: some fruit and maybe a smoothie or big glass of milk...3 hours later, lunch: something with protein; chicken etc...3 hours later, snack: treat yourself to what you like but not too much...3 hours later, dinner: again protein which is the best thing to lose weight; fish, chicken, beef, you pick...3 hours later, snack: something light but something you like...Don't eat anything late night when you know you're going to sleep soon even though you do burn more calories sleeping than watching T.V...Just stay active...You don't nesecarily need to graze every 3 hours if you have a hectic schedule...Just make sure to not eat until you're full...Just eat reasonably throughout the day...If you have a craving for something, most likely, your brain is confusing thirst with hunger...Drink a big glass of water when you have a craving and most likely after 10 minutes, the craving will go away...Good luck, it'll seem hard but after you get the hang of things, you'll find out, it just takes a little faith and patience...You don't have to eat anything you DON'T like, there are so many other alternatives than eating rabbit food (salads, which by the way, if you use iceberg lettuce, you're not gettin jack from it considering it has no nutritional value. Stick to romaine lettuce if you do.) that you can try in order to get the nutrients and vitamins without having to shove massive amount of lettuce down your throat...Multivitamins, smoothies, fruits, nuts, cereals etc...|`|ZLQ6X0oOaa	Trust me, i am not advertising but you have to look at Jason Vale (The Juice Master) His books are so good, i have 7 of them and the advice, motivation, juicing recipies etc are so so good, look at this link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.juicemaster.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.juicemaster.com/</a><br>  <br>  And this book is very motivational<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.juicemaster.com/product.php?id=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.juicemaster.com/product.php?i...</a>|`|mkA615Ataa	Go on amazon and order "paul mckenna's ~ I can make you thin".

xjazE0xmaa	I don't think you're asking whether you can glue the diamonds together.  I think you're asking whether the diamonds can be set to give the appearance of a larger diamond--right?  <br>  <br>  If so, the answer is yes.  Tell jewelers you want an "invisible setting."<br>  <br>  This popular and labor-intensive technique was developed in France two centuries ago and made famous at the end of the 20th century by Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. In the invisible setting the stones (typically square shaped diamonds – princess or emerald cut – for better fit) are set next to each other without any visible metal holding them in place. To ensure that the stones do not fall out, jewelers create small grooves in the pavilion of the stones, slightly below the crown. These grooves slip into a metal framework below the crown surface in a way that makes the frame invisible from above, creating the appearance of a solid surface of gemstones. In some sense, the result looks somewhat similar to the pavé technique. The invisible setting creates the illusion of larger diamonds, and the technique can be used to create the impression of a larger central stone (consisting of several smaller ones) or to accent a larger central gemstone.<br>  <br>  The invisible setting provides excellent protection of the diamonds from damage and wear and tear. It also is less likely to damage things that brush against the ring.<br>  <br>  The key disadvantage of this setting is the damage done to the diamonds when setting—jewelers have to cut the grooves in the diamonds, which diminishes the gemstones’ market value. This is only important if at some point the diamonds might be resold as loose diamonds.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.|`|AA12217110	Um, this is a Health & Well-being question how exactly?|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	No.  But you could have all the loose diamonds put into a new mounting, whether it's a new ring, necklace or whatever.|`|xZZD7LZ6aa	Yes and no.<br>  There are natural diamonds which are mined and cannot be altered. (Which is why they're so expensive) However, there are man-made diamonds which are cheaper and less exotic but aren't as detrimental to the environment. (Research the environmental impact mined diamonds have.)|`|GrBH30vfaa	not at all, you can trade them for a bigger one. you cannot put them in a pot and melt them, sorry :-)<br>  setting next to each other might give them the appearance of a bigger gem, it is commonly done by many jewelers|`|XF2vVY3Uaa	Then it wouldn't be natural. Try cash for gold.
ijLewIjnaa	Well, the doctors did say to give it some time and since that "some time" has passed, you should go back and tell them it's still as bad as before.  An x-ray would be a great idea...any solution, but the important thing is to have it checked out ASAP.  Tonight, I suggest you visit www.webmd.com and input all your symptoms so that they can give you the best diagnosis that they can.  Best of luck!  Lis|`|r1WXMccLaa	well if it hurts x ray

And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha<br>  <br>  MORE TIPS: <br>  <br>  chew gum - sugar free.

If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise.

28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	Pouch tobacco has more tar in it and you are more likely to smoke it without a filter, so they would be very bad for you but they do not contain the chemicals which is why they go out if you don't keep puffing on them. However taylor made's (pack cigarettes) as you say, are full of chemicals, but, they also have many harmful poisons in them, things you can't buy over the counter, so the choice is yours, die of lung Cancer from all the tar or heart attack/stroke from the chemicals and poisons.

A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars.

So eating less does not necessarily equate losing more weight. That said, one of the things to take into consideration with these "lose 10lbs in 10 days" diets is that often what's lost is water weight. Our bodies retain a lot of water, and eating or drinking certain things will cause you to retain more water whereas other things will cause you to retain less water. So okay, sure, maybe you would lose 10lbs in 10 days, but that might also be 10lbs for the entire month. Regardless, to lose weight in that manner and that quickly is incredibly unhealthy for your body. It puts a lot of strain on your heart and actually is likely to cause you other health issues.|`|8SRjELNBaa	You should eat normal, but just fewers calories, your metabolism will adjust so you don't gain it all back.|`|2ldEGsjwaa	let's try the syrup-lemon-cayenne "cleanse"let's  see if woks???|`|XChDnnbLaa	Ive been doing "8 minute abs"<br>  on youtube. look up fitforthesummer also on youtube and click on the account named that.

The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day<br>  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help. <br>  8 classes of water a day<br>  <br>  the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be. <br>  <br>  did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things.

W2z5dCrmaa	There are ways to keep the results that you gained and even progress. There are lots of way to use your own body weight like push ups, sit ups, crunches, chin-ups, wall leaning and resistance to gravity. squats, Crouching thigh and butt tightening...etc.<br>  <br>  You can do underhand chin ups, over hand chin ups, elbow spread chin ups. Can modify push ups the same, so you start to see how you are doing some of the same things but in a different way.<br>  <br>  Anything that works a muscle builds it.  <br>  <br>  All of these will continue to build you and keep you in form for when you get back. You will even pick up lots this way, especially in just starting like you are. <br>  <br>  Get an exercise ball as well, and that you can take anywhere. There are routines that instruct you how to work with it and get lots from it.<br>  <br>  Don't just quit and let yourself go Dude! Machines, weights, bars, and bells isn't all that there is... we just use those lots because they're handy. <br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|G4YfDQOiaa	for the two weeks you will not be going to the gym take up a jogging route and do it 3-4 times a week. in addition do some sit ups and push ups. it may not give you the same results as the gym but it will keep you losing fat and not gaining any more weight.|`|RMmh0aimaa	Your body has 'muscle memory' so getting back into shape will be much easier than it was the first time.<br>  <br>  However you can always do exercises at home that do not necessarily require weights to keep you toned while you are away.|`|SltEwVX7aa	yeah, it'll be like starting over.

Then when you are in, make yourself his #1 assistant. Believe me once you are in with the specialist he will always want you to be his assistant. Here are a few places that employee specialists:  Western Dental, Dental Associates, Access Dental, and any of your local big dental chains. I hope this was helpful.

vukRiS1Eaa	First off, congratulations for being brave enough to ask about this. It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!<br>  <br>  Masturbation is basically touching yourself in ways that feel good sexually. For girls it usually includes one or more orgasms, but not always--some girls just like the feeling and don't focus on having an orgasm every time. It's a great way to relieve stress, to enjoy fantasies and sexual feelings without any danger, and to learn about your body so that things feel even better when you do have sex. It's just like anything else--with practice, your body will learn what it likes and how to respond, and when you do something with someone else it will be even better!<br>  <br>  There's no one particular thing you have to do--everyone's different. Most girls get the most intense pleasure from rubbing their clit. Some like the feeling of penetration. Some have sensitive nipples and like rubbing them. Just explore and find out what you like.<br>  <br>  As for ways to do it, you have several options:<br>  <br>  1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!<br>  <br>  2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!<br>  <br>  3. Vibrator. No, you can't go out and buy one at your age from a sex shop. However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).<br>  <br>  <br>  Orgasms usually last for about 10-15 seconds. It's a peak of pleasure, when good feelings shoot through your whole body. Your muscles will contract and you will clench down there several times involuntaraly. Most people make some sort of noise, but it's not usually loud. I wouldn't worry about anyone hearing.<br>  <br>  You don't have to be a certain age to have an orgasm--if you're horny, you can have one!|`|PImvmP1paa	An orgasm is climax. <br>  <br>  It happens during masturbation and for 10% of most women when they're having sex. Meaning 90% of women do not experience climax, an orgasm, during sexual intercourse. <br>  <br>  Some, not all, women experience female ejaculation. <br>  <br>  When you have reached climax, the muscles from your butt hole to your clitoris tense up then relax. How many times your muscles tense up and then relax, depends on how good it feels.|`|tX21M00faa	It when your body goes into this trance and you start feeling this tingle first then it gets more and more intense until you seem to explode and then it slowly goes away in a wave like feeling. Some women can easily get an orgasm and some can't, it's genetic apparently, I read it in a magazine.|`|AA10201252	an orgasm is mainly when a female reaches her maximum pleasure when having sex , she ejaculates some kind of fluids from her body and these fluids r the reason u feel this amount of pleasure cause they keep storring in a small bag inside u and then suddenly explode out and that's when u feel the ORGASM|`|yIEVthXTaa	woman do not release fluid just feel great, usually from the friction of a pen.is going in and out|`|PIVWTdzOaa	an amazing feeling during sex|`|RkolHVfAaa	It is a burst of pleasure released after a period of Mastur Bation, both men and women have them.<br>  For Men: Rub thier pen is up and down until ejac ulation which is when they have their orgasm.<br>  Women: Explore their vag with a toy (finger, dil do) and run the clit until they have an orgasm.

I am assuming you mean Calories.  There's a difference between calories and Calories.  A Calorie is 1000 calories.  <br>  <br>  In order to burn 500 Calories in 2 hours, you would have to exert 2093400 Joules of energy in 2 hours.  <br>  <br>  That's 290.75 Joules per second.  <br>  <br>  That would kill you.|`|B12E4rYiaa	You would need to do intense cardio and if you cannot do it yet you can work on building the intensity. It's the intensity that burns fat and will also increase metabolism. You can even get to the point that you're burning fat while resting. It also helps to weight train because muscle burns fat.|`|UM9LlPWDaa	I exercise for at least 30mins every day and stop eating entire meals. I allow myself to still go to fast food restaurants occassionally but I get just the entree not the meal, and I cut out soda and other things high in sugar.

Vitamin C for example is important for the proper absorption of iron.<br>  <br>  Here are some foods that you can eat that will supply you with iron.  They are eggs, liver beef, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, almonds, avocados, beets, blackstrap molasses, dates, dulse, kelp, kidney and lima beans, lentils, millet, peaches, pears, pumpkins and watercress. <br>  <br>  You will obtain a wide variety of B vitamins from nut and seeds.

yFX0mdOhaa	The fat is going away, trust me... it just doesn't seem like it.  You lose weight proportionally, so even though your stomach may shrink, the body around it shrinks also (your chest, arms, legs) so even thinner, your stomach (or whatever problem area you might concentrate on) is still the same proportion to the rest of your body.  Unless you put on muscle, you will still notice the fat until you get closer to 10%.  I felt the same way... I kept losing weight, but didn't feel like I looked any different.  If you actually took before and after pictures, you would notice a slight differnece, but you still have to get closer to 10% to start getting the nice shape.|`|rRq8ndxFaa	You probably haven't been watching what you eat.  Getting fit doesn't mean eating less, in a lot of ways it means eating more. So, technically you should be eating 5-6 times a day and practicing portion control. If you are losing weight but not fat, it is muscle that you are losing which is a result of not eating enough or not eating the right things.|`|MSl6tMTvaa	run a lot and lie n the floor and try to pick your self up without using your hands sorta like sit ups it takes away unwanted fat from your stomach|`|dvevk1qbaa	you lost muscle....dont just cut back the fat...start working out more|`|IOVDAwmnaa	um it will, you just have to keep dropping weight, i guess.|`|z9nCUpaOaa	You've probably lost muscle.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	You are probably eating a more healthy diet but not exercising enough.

I stopped growing when I was around 16 too (I'm 6'2 though, lol)<br>  <br>  It is critically to have a healthy diet around middle school to the beginning of high school in order to grow taller (and the genes are important).

bcc8647434f2debeaef0e3a8f2b04b1baa	its possible you might get them off early, however your orthodontist is most likely not just looking @ the alignment of your teeth but also your bite. Once they are satisfied w/ both of those you'll get them off.  Just an extra, following your orthodontist inst.s and not breaking brackets off or missing appts will help you in this regard.  when you do that you set yourself back. :)|`|AA11263103	yes, since they don't know how fast your teeth are moving..

No matter what any one else who responds to this says, go to your doctor. Chances are that it's absolutely nothing, maybe you had a cold or you're having hormonal changes associated with your pregnancy, but either way this has the potential to be very serious and deserves better than an internet forum.|`|GUGghhItaa	What it sounds like is something that should not be happening.  Getting a diagnosis from people on Yahoo Answers is not the way to deal with this.  Get to a doctor, tell the doctor what is happening to you and then follow through on whatever the doctor recommends.  In fact if you are really smart you will get an opinion and then get a second one.

2YdNp2Ybaa	my opinion is your young and it will be your permanant adult teeth comming through quite late. it is rare but it can be treated when a tooth is growing in the palette bone of the mouth. it needs to grow a little more so thats plans can be made to move them. what they will probably do is make space using braces for your new teeth to move into...once the teeth are long enough and space is made they will attach a bracket on the new teeth aswell and run a thin wire (bracing wire) through them aswell. onve all the teeth are attached this way with the braces they will overtime form a perfect arch. <br>  <br>  for the pain you should take paracetamol with added dihydracodiene or a strong pain relief...make sure you seek professional advise from your dentist|`|tGEMwgyBaa	If the teeth you have in front are your permanent teeth, not your baby teeth, then you may have supernumerary teeth (extra teeth) growing behind your adult teeth. It's not very common but it is a possibility.

Then they glue these metal pieces to your teeth, one at a time, and then once they dry a wire is put through them to hold them all together and attached to the rings. Next they'll put on colored rubber bands(you choose colors) on the metal piece(bracket) so it attaches to the wire. It doesn't hurt at all to get them on, a little uncomfortable, maybe, but doesn't hurt.<br>  <br>  The next day your teeth will probably hurt really bad though(not to scare you, its tolerable). Since the braces are suddenly pulling your teeth in a different direction, hard, it'll feel sore and you'll constantly feel your teeth being pulled. It might be hard to eat, too. That only lasts for a few days at most though. When I first got mine on I couldn't close my teeth all the way, my back teeth wouldn't touch. That only lasted for a few days, until my teeth shifted. <br>  <br>  Each month when you go to get your rubber bands changed, the next day it might feel like your teeth are being pulled a little bit. It doesn't hurt that bad, and only lasts for a day at the most, and sometimes it doesn't even hurt. <br>  <br>  Your braces might cause irritation on the inside of your mouth, so make sure you get wax from the orthodontist. If you start to feel something irritating you, just put a piece of wax over the part of the braces until your mouth heals. Eventually you get used to braces and they don't hurt your mouth anymore. If you feel a wire poking through the rings to the side of your mouth, tell your orthodontist,  because they can just cut it so it doesn't bother you.<br>  <br>  They will tell you when you get them that you have to be careful what you eat. It's always a good idea to be careful, especially in the beginning not to bite into anything really sticky or chewy. Eventually once you get used to having braces you can take a bite into an apple or chew gum, but you have to be very careful not to break a bracket. You'll be able to tell when you break a bracket because it will feel loose and you might be able to move it around. The only thing holding it on is the rubber band, so you can take it off if it bothers you. Make sure you tell your orthodontist if you break one because they have to glue a new one on, or else its not helping you at all. Same thing if you break a wire, or if a ring comes loose. Tell them of any problems.<br>  <br>  Last thing, brushing and cleaning. When you get braces they'll tell you that you have to brush a certain way. Make sure you do this the best you can so you don't damage your teeth. You'll have to use a soft toothbrush to brush your teeth now, and flossing takes much longer, I barely do it anymore. Make sure you keep your teeth clean.|`|07qFHL6iaa	I don't remember exactly, but I think i remember it didn't hurt the first cuple of hours, but then it hurt REALLY bad for a cuple days.

Try to stretch during breaks, and bend and twist both ways every 15mins or so.<br>  <br>  Long-term use of NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like Tylenol, are the cause of about 25% of stomach ulcers. Yes they are bad for you. Some NSAIDS are enteric coated, meaning that they have a coating that protects them from dissolving in the stomach, but will release in the small intestine, preventing the ulcer formation. Ask your doctor about these, about physio and about getting a workplace assessment.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	When you go to the doctor they will ask about when the problem started and what things you have tried to relieve the pain.<br>  <br>  They will also ask something about your job to see if that gives clue as to what is causing the back pain.   Then after asking a few more questions they will send you for an x-ray or an MRI.<br>  <br>  They may at this time also prescribe something a bit stronger in the way of anti-inflammatory medication that can be of more help to you than the Tylenol.  Depending on what else is going on to cause this pain they may make a recommendation of having you try some muscle relaxers to see if that helps to ease some of the pain.
bEbkV69naa	Well, if you are trying to quit on your own it is possible but having a friend or someone to help you by giving moral support would be good as well. You don't seem to have much of a habit. You obviously want to stop and that is a huge plus toward success. You already realize one benefit of quitting (sports). Avoid the situations where you are prone to smoke. Also, substitute some positive activity(s) in place of the smoking urge. I doubt that your body has developed a strong addiction to nicotine based on the small amount that you currently smoke; but increasing from 3 to 6 was not a move in the positive direction, and you realize that. I believe your goal of quitting is very attainable; think of it like a competition---are you gonna let a little cigarette beat you!? (or 3 cigarettes)  Of course not! Whip their butts!!!   (lol)|`|cy8VEbuCaa	well yes it will be hard but that makes it all the better when you accomplish it.<br>  you have to fight and have tons of will power<br>  you especially don't wanna ruin sports you play because your activity just won't be as great as your potential. <br>  i know tons of people who quit smoking so of coarse you'll be able to do too.|`|tX21M00faa	Yes, you seem to be a social smoker.

They just get you to lay in the chair and they put(glue actually) each bracket on each tooth one at a time and then they put the wires in after that. It is a long procedure but it doesn't really hurt, althought you will find your teeth and gums will gradually becomes sore a couple days after and they will remain sore for about a week or two. You may feel a little pressure at times though when they are placing the brackets on your teeth.<br>  <br>  If you like to eat crunchy or tough things I suggest you eat those types of things before getting the braces on because for about a week or two you will have very sore teeth because of the constant pulling and pressure of the new wires. So for the time while your teeth are sore you will be eating soft things like pudding and stuff. <br>  <br>  Purple and blue are nice colors. DO NOT get red because it makes it look like your gums are bleeding. Trust me, they look awful. <br>  <br>  And also green ones make you look like you have lettuce or some other food left behind.<br>  <br>  And yellow ones don't look very good either because it makes you look like you don't brush your teeth. Yuck.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	1. Teeth move through the use of force. The force applied by the archwire pushes the tooth in a particular direction and a stress is created within the periodontal ligament. The modification of the periodontal blood supply[2] determines a biological response which leads to bone remodeling, where bone is created on one side by osteoblast cells and resorbed on the other side by osteoclasts.<br>  <br>  Two different kinds of bone resorption are possible. Direct resorption, starting from the lining cells of the alveolar bone, and indirect or retrograde resorption, where osteoclasts start their activity in the neighbour bone marrow. Indirect resorption takes place when the periodontal ligament has become(necrosis or hyalinization), for an excessive amount and duration of compressive stress. In this case the quantity of bone resorbed is larger than the quantity of newly formed bone (negative balance). Bone resorption only occurs in the compressed periodontal ligament. Another important phenomenon associated with tooth movement is bone deposition. Bone deposition occurs in the distracted periodontal ligament. Without bone deposition, the tooth will loosen and voids will occur distal to the direction of tooth movement.<br>  <br>  A tooth will usually move about a millimeter per month during orthodontic movement, but there is high individual variability. Orthodontic mechanics can vary in efficiency, thus explaining a wide range of response to orthodontic treatment.<br>  <br>  2.  Eat lots of sticky , sugary foods!!!<br>  <br>  3.  Purple and Pink perhaps would look wonderful on you!!|`|PwkYJoVgaa	get purple and blue! ha easy as that.|`|bT0bMxmfaa	Hurray for braces! :D<br>  <br>  (1) The procedure for braces is quite long.  I recommend you have a friend come with you or someone to talk to.  Or maybe a handheld game or iPod.  First, they clean out your teeth with water and I believe toothpaste (it depends on which orthodontist you visit) is used as well.  They will apply this bluish-liquid that tastes horrible to your teeth to sort of bleach them a bit so the dirt is removed (not sure about that part, but it tastes bad).  You might need to wait a few minutes so it sinks in.  Then, they apply glue to the bracket (metal square) and your teeth.  If the process is done all at once, (mines was done with the top first and the bottom on a separate day) it will take a while to dry.  But it's only about ten to twenty minutes tops, but if you get bored easily, a game/person to talk to would come in handy.  After the braces have dried, here comes the semi-painful part.  A wire is fit into your brackets & the rubber bands are placed in.  You might feel a bit of pain, but it'll wear off in several days, maybe a week.  Pretty long process, but I got through it and so will you!<br>  <br>  (2) Hm, I'd eat popcorn, apples, chips, corn, etc.  And wash it all down with soda!  I really wish I could do that again because when you have braces, you can't eat those things.  Well, you can try but they get stuck or the brackets fall off.  And soda can damage your teeth while the brackets are on your teeth.  So enjoy!<br>  <br>  (3) I think that blue & purple would fit you best because it's what you like.  Mostly, braces don't really matter about how you look like in them (you're going to have to wear them anyway, so it doesn't matter), so it's better to pick something you like.  And if you don't like them, you can always change them when you get them tightened.  Plus, you can do a purple/blue/purple/blue/purple/blue theme :D (hehe that's what I like to do!).  You can always change them for the seasons too (Christmas - green/red/green/red | Fourth of July - red/white/blue/red/white/blue).  Some orthodonists are very limited on colors, so if you get the ones you want, you're pretty lucky! (:<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck with your braces tomorrow!|`|OOsP9Kopaa	You get braces by them super gluing the metal bracket parts to your teeth, then they thread a wire though the brackets and hold it on with colored rubber bands. It's doesn't hurt really, just tastes bad. <br>  Make sure to brush and floss and mouth wash when you have them, or they will hurt when they need to be tightened.<br>  <br>  If your getting the normal braces with rubber bands you switch colors evey time you get them changed. I say get a color you think is pretty. Or go with the holidays (red and green for x-mas and stuff) But try to avoid light colors like white, they will stain really easy. I had white bands and ate mustard on a hot dog and they stained this really nasty yellow.<br>  <br>  Eat a BIG dinner. Braces don't hurt when they put them on but they do hurt till your teeth adjust. But just for a few days, week at the most. <br>  Eat popcorn, hard candy,gummy candy, peanuts, ANYTHING you won't be able to eat with braces. There will be times when you cheat and eat that stuff (every one does), but it is a pain to get it out of your <br>  braces.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|Baxqbf4oaa	1: What is the procedure for getting them?<br>  - They use a little mouth opener thing that stretches your mouth open, then they put the cement on your teeth and place the brackets. then they put on the wire, then the elastics.<br>   PUT ON ALOT OF CHAPSTICK BEFORE YOU GO IN CAUSE AFTER YOUR LIPS WILL BE REALLY DRY!<br>  <br>  2: My mom said tonight i can eat whatever i want. I know it's my opinion but i hate having to decide :P. So if you were me, what would you choose?<br>  - lol, Anything chewy you can get your hands on! Corn is hard to eat with braces! It's not that bad though.<br>  <br>  3: What color would fit me best? My fave color is purple but i also like blue.<br>  -Haha it doesn't matter, you could get purple and blue my friends got that and it looks good, you change it every month though.<br>  <br>  Also, Your teeth will hurt alot for 2-4 days when you get them on though!|`|ynFtyVKYaa	The procedure is they have to glue the braces on there the little squares that go on first it doesnt hurt then they are going to put the crowns on in the back it that part actually hurts because they stick a tool and have you bite down very hard to make sure its tight and in place then they will stick the bracets the wire through your braces you can barely feel it..You should eat gummy, sticky, peanuts etc. stuff like that because you wont be able to when you get braces also i think the color purple would look best on you|`|U7SnmcxYaa	they put metal on your teeth and tighten them? haha. <br>  if i were you id have tacos andddd<br>  youd look really nice in purple.<br>  btw your sooo pretty! *jelous*|`|u1qgyGFNaa	kkk|`|5HYbJmbcaa	Procedure<br>   <br>  A patient's teeth are prepared for application of braces.Orthodontic services may be provided by any licensed dentist trained in orthodontics. In North America most orthodontic treatment is done by orthodontists, dentists in diagnosis and treatment of malocclusions—malalignments of the teeth, jaws, or both. A dentist must complete 2–3 years of additional post-doctoral training to earn a specialty certificate in orthodontics. There are many general practitioners who also provide orthodontic services.<br>  <br>  The first step is to determine if braces are suitable for the patient. The doctor consults with the patient and inspects the teeth visually. If braces are appropriate, a records appointment is set up where X-rays, molds, and impressions are made. These records are analyzed to determine the problems and proper course of action. Typical treatment times vary from six months to two and a half years depending on the complexity and types of problems. Orthognathic surgery may be required in extreme cases.<br>  <br>  Teeth to be braced will have an applied to help the cement bond to the surface of the tooth. In most cases the teeth will be banded and then brackets will be added. A bracket will be applied with dental cement, and then cured with light until hardened. This process usually takes a few seconds per tooth. If required, orthodontic spacers may be inserted between the molars to make room for molar bands to be placed at a later date. Molar bands are required to ensure brackets will stick. Bands are also utilized when dental fillings or other dental work make securing a bracket to a tooth infeasible.<br>  <br>  An archwire will be threaded between the brackets and affixed with elastic or metal ligatures. Elastics are available in a wide variety of colors. Archwires are bent, shaped, and tightened frequently to achieve the desired results. Brackets with hooks can be placed, or hooks can be created and affixed to the archwire to affix the elastic to. The placement and configuration of the elastics will depend on the course of treatment and the individual patient. Elastics are made in different diameters, colors, sizes, and strengths.<br>  <br>  Modern orthodontics makes frequent use of nickel-titanium archwires and temperature-sensitive materials. When cold, the archwire is limp and flexible, easily threaded between brackets of any configuration. Once heated to body temperature, the archwire will stiffen and seek to retain its shape, creating constant light force on the teeth.<br>  <br>   <br>  Dental braces, with a transparent powerchain, removed after completion of treatment.In many cases there is insufficient space in the mouth for all the teeth to fit properly. There are two main procedures to make room in these cases. One is extraction: teeth are removed to create more space. The second is expansion: the palate or arch is made larger by using a palatal expander. Expanders can be used with both children and adults. Since the bones of adults are already fused, expanding the palate is not possible without surgery to unfuse them. An expander can be used on an adult without surgery, but to expand the dental arch, and not the palate.<br>  <br>  For some patients, Invisalign are a viable alternative to traditional braces. The Invisalign system uses a series of clear plastic trays to move teeth into their position over a length of time. While conventional braces are fixed to the patient's teeth, and are therefore always working, Invisalign trays are removable. Removing the trays results in a longer treatment time. The system is not recommended for more difficult cases, or for people whose last molars have yet to erupt.<br>  <br>  Each month or two, the braces must be adjusted. This helps shift the teeth into the correct position. When they get adjusted the orthodontist takes off the colored rubber bands keeping the wire in place. The wire is then taken out, and may be replaced or modified. When the wire has been placed back into the mouth, the patient may choose a color for the new rubber bands, which are then fixed to the metal brackets. The adjusting process may cause some discomfort, which is normal.<br>  <br>  Just eat whatever you normally eat, no big deal.<br>  <br>  For color, blue and purple look good on anyone. In my opinion, purple, because alot of people get blue.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I know my answer is looooonnnng.<br>  SARA|`|YhoUANPKaa	First, they clean your teeth.  Then they put this special glue on each tooth, then they stick a metal bracket on the tooth.  Then they slide a wire through each bracket, then they put the colored bands on the brackets.  The whole thing for me lasted about an hour.  Your mouth will feel kind of weird after they do the procedure, and a few hours later, your mouth will start to get sore.  You'll be in the most pain the following day, then it starts to get a little bettter.  You should get completely used to them after 1-2 weeks.<br>  <br>  I don't really care what you eat, but maybe you should eat something soft, like macarronni and cheese, so you can get used to eating soft stuff.<br>  <br>  I think that you should get a pattern of light yellow and blue.  Or light purple and blue :)|`|wlaEnkc9aa	Procedure, not much they just glue on the brackets and attach the wire, it won't hurt<br>  But after a couple of hours it will start to feel weird and when you go to bed it'll be hard to go to sleep. Eat right after you get them on a lot, because the longer you wait the worse it feels like you're eating rocks that are chewable EW. Also cold water helps me get over the weirdness. The weird feeling lasts a couple days but after the first day it gets better, the best day is the third the least pain when you eat.<br>  Eat everything :)<br>  Well you can get both, like a pattern blue, purple, blue etc. I think both would good on you.<br>  Braces don't hurt, the main thing is just adjusting to them that's why it's wierd for 3 days after they get tightened. You'll have great teeth later :)<br>  Oh I've also chewed gum although they tell you not to, nothing happens but once it kinda got stuck on my bracket, but I learned not to make it happen again :)|`|kFKgU3Vtaa	1. All you gotta do is open your mouth for like 30 mins. They glue the brackets to your teeth and adds wire to it. <br>  <br>  2. I dont know but this is a list of things you CANNOT eat:<br>  sticky foods: caramels, carameled apples, toffee, Now & laters, sugar daddies, sugar babies, tootsie rolls, starbursts, licorice, and gummy bears.<br>  <br>  Hard foods: nuts, popcorn, hard candy, corn on cob, doritos, jerky, , bagels, pizza crusts, hard pretzels, ice, apples, carrots (unless cooked or cut into small pieces)<br>  <br>  EAT MUCH LESS: candy, ice cream, cookies, foods with sugar, cake, and pie.<br>  <br>  DRINK MUCH LESS: soda pop, and drinks with sugar<br>  <br>  3. You should either get glow in the dark blue or purple. (you can change the color later.)<br>  <br>  if u have any questions just ask me. :)|`|RTRG3PIaaa	Braces huh? I have braces.<br>  1.* First the orthodontist cleans your teeth. Then they polish your teeth. after that they glue the brackets on.(the colored things). Then they open the brackets and place the wire on and close the brackets.<br>  *have you had those blue elastic thins yet? <br>  2. If I were you, I would eat the hard things that I like, for example; apples, chips, nougat. Because you wouldn't be having them for a week or so. But if you like lasagnane then your lucky.<br>  3.I think the colour that will suit you most would be purple. 2 colours are more expensive, but if you want get purple and blue. They are great together. I hope that answers everythin'! :D|`|pULDq0oSaa	oh that sucks that your getting them i had them once too. <br>  the procedure for getting them is they put these things in your mouth to keep your mouth open. next they take the mold of your mouth, that has the glue on it and put it on your teeth and leave it there and after they do that theydo it to the other half of your teeth. after that i think they fit the wire for your braces and tighten them and then they put the color on (purple i think u should go with). and oh before you go take advil or ibuprofin or sumthing bc its going to hurt like a hour later. so yeah i would eat whatever you like beacuse its going to hurt for a week or two after you get them on<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope that helps!|`|Omz3yoaAaa	they use three different types of glue to glue the brackets down with those glues, then they wait of it to dry, then the put the wires on. they hurt like hell. so eat really soft foods after you get them on, and if they give you wax use it to prevent cuts in your mouth, but also sometimes you will wake up with cut in your mouth. ask your orthodontist if they will give you purple and blue, they usually will. hope this helps :]|`|F0sfmZFnaa	1. Getting braces in no biggie at all...totally painless free. They simply put glue on each tooth that gets a bracket, put those brackets on, let them dry, then do the back teeth that they hook the wire on - this can be a tiny bit painful, since they may have to try different crowns to find the one that fits - some dentists make you bite down on something so the crown goes over your tooth, but there is very very very little pain involved. Then, they thread the wire through each bracket and you get your colors! :)<br>  <br>  2. SOMETHING CHEWY. Once you get braces, really sticky stuff like caramels, now and laters, gum, etc. are a big no-no. So if you really like that stuff, eat it NOW!! lol. And have some ice cream since ice cream is just good like that. <br>  <br>  3. I think any color will look good on you!! NEVER get yellow - your teeth will look yellow...and red looks evil. But I think purple will look best on you, actually.|`|yDHPupgJaa	well it brings back memories.<br>  PAIN! not to be mean or anything....but it hurts.<br>  I guess it depends on the doctor. <br>  <br>  They will make space between your teeth way way in the back....they will stick something metal-ish in there to hold the wire. Before they place the wire they will glue on the little square thing-es &&& then they place the wire over the metal squares. At the very end they put your rubber bands on. I started with black. But if you like purple you should mix it up (black & purple)<br>  <br>  ohhh & you should eat a lot because you wont be able to chew on anything for a while. Believe me. =/|`|pXtreShsaa	Chill There not that bad!!<br>  <br>  1. They put these things onyou mouth 2 hold it open. Then they use 2 glues and put little brackets on. Then they put the wires in and clip them ( they might put springs on). It only hurts a little bit you wont feel anything!!!!!!<br>  2. Carmel, Lollipops and CHEW TONS OF GUM!!! :)<br>  3.Dark Puple and light purple!!!!!!!!|`|AzME6jxNaa	1.First they glue brackets onto your teeth then they string them through so they o all the way through the front same with bottom and attach it to your back tooth.doesn't hurt too much<br>  2.Chinese food and alot of candy since they don't like for you to eat that<br>  3.i think blue would look fabulous|`|41wwraeXaa	1. they get glued to your teeth!<br>  2. Eat sticky stuff, and chew some gum because you will not be able to once you get your braces!<br>  3. The dentist can put on two different colors, so you can have blue and purple!|`|PNdtSrgZaa	k so i have braces!idk bout the food or color but take tylenol b4 u go! it hurts but only after u get them.  it dosent hurt.  all they do it clean off ur teeth and then glue on the brackets and make sure that they r in place with a little laser thing! good luck and every time they hurt or u dont like them think of how ur teeth wil look l8r!|`|0ez9nR5Gaa	They'll put these lip-stretchy things on. (Bring chap-stick!!) That is to hold your lips open and keep your teeth dry. They might put something in your mouth so nothing goes down your throat..<br>  It doesn't hurt, don't worry.<br>  <br>  Eat some caramel and toffee and gum!! :)|`|hHbEabPqaa	1: they just glue the brackets on, put the wire on, and tighten the brackets.<br>  <br>  2: gum, popcorn, M&Ms,<br>  <br>  3. i say purples good|`|HP4AGp9Uaa	well i've had my braces for 6 years and there not terrible. i eat everything so it doesnt really matter. but my braces break sometimes. maybe alternating purple and blue?!?|`|vzRwazI0aa	popcorn...|`|xdJJF6sdaa	It takes a while and your mouth get so dry because its open for so long. I don't remember it hurting when I got them on, but a few days after it hurts a little, and they tear open the insides of your lips, so you will need the wax that is sold at drug store's to put on them. Oh yeah I remember my lips being chapped. Carmex worked the best.<br>  <br>  When I had braces I ate whatever I wanted to but I also spent a lot more money getting them fixed because of some foods I ate. Corn is hard to eat, tacky candy like now and laters pulled one off before, gum is hard at first, and some others but those are all I remember.<br>  <br>  If you don't smoke or drink Coffee try to get the clear braces with clear bands.
tgCuwPJ5aa	While most people will say no, I bet most of those people are lying. I think everyone goes through a period like that eventually. I did in high school. Hell, just recently, I lost my job. My friend, rather than help me find a job and keep going to college, pulled strings and got his girlfriend of 2 months her third job rather than get me another one. My dog got an infected ear and it had to be amputated. My mother got a surgery that went wrong and now can't use her hands, and my grandmother had a "senior moment" where she sold about 100 acres of land in alabama to a cousin, who's a con artist, for a lump sum of $12,000; that's less than what she could have gotten PER ACRE for the land.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to one-up you, saying that my problems are worse. I believe that negativeness breeds negativeness. With the economy and the world the way it is, though, how can we NOT feel bad? The world is crap right now, there's no way around it. A lot of people are probably having similar problems, as well as similar thoughts.<br>  <br>  Yes, I've had thoughts about that before. I've wanted to do it, even. But I didn't, and in all honesty, I'm glad for it. If by losing your father you mean he's no longer with us, I doubt he'd want you to join him just because of it. I don't mean to be rude, but people die. It's a part of life. It's not fair, and I know that doesn't make it hurt less; I've lost people too. The feeling like your world has truly been smashed to pieces and roughly rearranged, going to bed feeling like you don't know yourself because of how things have changed. Then the realization that, while you have this wild dream in your head of how you wish things were, that you did actually have something like it before.<br>  <br>  Loss is a part of life, but remember, so is gain. No matter how corny or cliched it may sound, but things will get better. Unfortunately, by mere definition, things have to be at their worst before they start getting better. But I believe that, if you want to get a good idea of what kind of a person someone is, you should not look at what they hold dear, but how they react when they lose it. I've had days where I just didn't want to get out of bed so nothing bad would happen. That's no way to live. But rather than just not live at all, stand proud. You dont have to be happy about it. You don't even have to act like you're happy about it. <br>  <br>  Be strong. I can't promise that you'll have a happy life, but you're not gauranteed to have a sad one either. If you do stand strong though, if you refuse to let life get you down and out, you won't feel fine, but you will feel better. That I can promise you.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	I had at one point thought of suicide, yes. But it was for a different reason. I was getting really stressed out from school and at the time I thought I could never be a good student and be as good as all of the other kids.<br>  <br>  Oh my goodness. That is terrible. I am so sorry for what happened, I can't even imagine what you're going through right now. My deepest condolences.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you to see a psychologist or at least tell your mother or your siblings that you need help. Please do not kill yourself. You have soo much to live for and you have everything going for you in life. Do NOT do it.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mother and look for a doctor to help you. Do it as soon as you can, okay?<br>  <br>  I wish you the best. Stay positive.|`|nO7Ie91laa	yeah like right now....<br>  talk to a close friend or someone u can trust in school.<br>  but i learned that its not the right way out of it.<br>  if u really wanted to kill yourself u would not be asking this question, YOU WOULD BE DEAD|`|EFOP8Lxdaa	Yeah, when I'm really really steaming mad. Like, "I'll kill myself and then that'll show them!"<br>  <br>  But then I think, "Wouldn't it be better to grow up and be successful? Wouldn't that show them that even though they do things like that to me, I can still be a successful, happy person?"|`|OUo9J4i1aa	Yes we all have and was very tragic to hear about your Dad and best friend. Can I recommend you get some couciling? Is there someone you can speak to about your problems? I'm really worried.|`|hdSt1Q7Vaa	Yes in my early teens to my late teens. And I attempted it several times and felt stupid later.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	i'm 28 now.. and i would say that suicide has ran through my mind since i was 14 quite a few times..  last time would have been yesterday...  i hang on... just... for my gf and our chihuahua...|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and is never the answer. Losing family members and friends is very hard, but you have to think, would your dad or your friend want to see you kill yourself? I don't think so. I think they'd want to see you happy and thriving. <br>  <br>  Think of how you feel now about your dad and your friend dying, and realize that is how people who care about you would feel if you killed yourself. Just don't do it. It's not worth it.|`|s805oRF7aa	I used to think about committing suicide alot. but after my friend killed himself i got to see how everyone was effected. It wasn't only his friends it was everyone who was sad. and i got to see how my friends would react it hurts everyone and even though i miss my friend so much his dying taught me that I don't really want to die. It took him dying to make me realize that I am worth something.|`|H5tvzBoGaa	yeah, just about everybody does. bad crap happens fast and once it does everything else looks worse than it really is<br>  <br>  over half of college students have thought about it<br>  15% have seriously considered it<br>  and 5% have made an attempt.<br>  <br>  think about the kids that haven't even had the opportunity to go to college!|`|LiV3cu2eaa	I have never personally wanted to kill myself. But I have tried to put myself in the frame of mind of a person who would. I guess some people just feel they can't handle their life. I feel that way sometimes but not to the point of death. there's always a hope for brighter day. but i guess for some that day just doesn't come soon enough|`|4ie1yCnZaa	im sure everyone has at one point in time:) i dont ever want to try <br>  it and i dont think you should.....try dealing it with other ways like talking to friends, family members, or counseling. Becasue think about it, if you commit suicide,, think about all the other people you are hurting like family members and friends. It will be like an on going chain of like depression. I hope everything works out:)<br>  Sorry for the spelling:)|`|9kg4eeCIaa	Yes i had after alot of **** aswell, for two years or so thought intensly about it. im much better now, found genuine friends.<br>  <br>  So glad i didnt.|`|2NzsJU4Jaa	yes and not bothered with it but im sorta reconsidering.|`|lcRbG4Csaa	yeah but I just cut myself.....another piece of cheese cake.|`|iUQdPswkaa	I have tried many times to kill myself i have scars up both my arms<br>  and was on life support once PZ don't try this as your only hurting yourself you need to work out in your own head why you our feeling like this and try your best to deal with it the best way you can talking to someone can help at times but the only person that can help you right now is yourself this prob sounds hard as your head is prob all over the place keep friends near that way you wont be on your own<br>  but if thing get really hard here is a link that may help you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps xx|`|dab47577283a37a55ea29d50e0ddbb45aa	YES, i dont know if they were truly attempts but i even tried to kill myself. good thing i didn't, or else i wouldn't be here to leave this answer! but to just answer you question, yes i have thought about it. my advice dont try it, it sucks. if you do it, your ultimately being selfish. if you try and fail, then you feel even more worthless... try talking to ANYONE about it. a friend, family member, a professional, teacher, councilor... ANYONE just so you can get some emotion out. they might not go "poof your cured" but they will listen to you atleast.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. dont listen to Mina she's a fruit cake and cut and pasted that answer from another answer she gave, she's heartless and cold.... and i HATE the answers the she gives|`|tX40VG9Xaa	no, never consider it! <br>  if i were you, id just wait it out. sometimes it seems like someone threw your world into a blender and left you there, but you just have to wait until it gets better, because i promise it will. plus, do u think ur dad or friend would be happy with u at all if u commited suicide? no! <br>  please dont. truly|`|9wk2bIfTaa	Yeah, I've had the thought. When I was in middle school, I had gone through a really tough time, and almost every day I was thinking of ways to kill myself, to end the pain. For whoever calls you emo for that just tell them to **** off.|`|QCr26nZNaa	Every single day. Obsess over science, destroy God, determine that life is meaningless and everything dies no matter what great things we may accomplish, and in time, every molecule will be infinitely disbursed in the terribly lonely heat-death of the universe. Repeat.|`|RGevXgJ6aa	We all have thoughts to do so, but usually never commit suicide. Your duty to god is to live your life to the fullest. Stop thinking about the bad things in life, and think of the good things that have happened.|`|obMwEtXKaa	I have, only like 3% seriously though. You just need to focus on the people you have left and what it would do to them if you were gone.|`|87Ua8oUaaa	I did when is was in Middle School because I just didn't see a point in going through all the pain of living everyday.|`|qlgsyv2Laa	Nope never have never will|`|gb7f3e0Eaa	what kind of question is that/<br>  r u a emo freak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IwQynLjtaa	yeah...<br>  When I am really mad.<br>  But I will never do it!|`|B19ht03Jaa	no i havent.|`|t4BqZx0paa	i have, but i fail, i just cut my self when i get really sad or pissed|`|262RePZFaa	Yes. Please feel free to email me, I've thought through this a lot and found some very good motivations for living.<br>  <br>  No, time is the only way out of all of our pain. Death is the way out of feeling anything at all, good or bad. That, in my humble opinion, is not an improvement. Trust me on this. You can get past it, no matter how bleak it seems, it will hurt less with time. Talk to friends about it, your family is probably going through the same pain as well.<br>  <br>  Stay alive, I promise there are moments that are worth it. Appreciate every sunrise, enjoy life for the sake of the people you know who didn't get the chance to. There is no rush to join them, you will both small and epic moments of happiness on this earth. All you have to do is open your eyes.

qrGLcTh4aa	Try to brush your tongue and floss. Most of the bacteria in your mouth is on your tongue. The best you can brush as far back as you can. Hold your breath so you don't gag. Flossing is essential because if your packing food in between your teeth, if you don't floss it will decay in your mouth.|`|btRMWf5Taa	brush your tongue...<br>  also, another problem could be is that your stomach could be another cause of your breath smelling bad.|`|DXh2BlCraa	The first thing to do is make sure you have a good oral hygiene routine. Brush your teeth and tongue twice a day and floss once a day. Research has shown that people that floss do have better breath than people who do not floss. Flossing will help to remove trapped food particles and prevent them from becoming a breeding ground for bacteria.<br>  <br>  * If you have dry mouth you may be able to get an artificial saliva substitute from your dentist. If you have an allergy that is causing your dry mouth then it would pay to try to identify your allergen and work on avoiding that allergen.<br>  <br>  * Visit a dental hygienist regularly for a professional clean. You should have this done every six months to make sure of no plaque build up between teeth.<br>  <br>  * Minimize the food supply for bacteria. The bacteria that release foul smelling gas thrive on protein rich foods. Vegetarians who eat less protein foods have much less problems with bad breath.<br>  <br>  * Using mouthwashes too often can not always be that good for you as they contain chemicals, however you can use a mouthwash of baking soda dissolved in water daily without any risk. <br>  <br>  This is a natural remedy and is very safe to use daily and can help to keep the tongue clean and free from bacteria. Squeezed lemon into water can also be used daily as a gargle and will prevent bad breath from reoccurring.<br>  <br>  * Adding yoghurt to your diet on a regular basis, preferably daily, can help to cure your breath condition and prevent it reoccurring. Yoghurt contains good bacteria and has a very good overall benefit for your health.<br>  <br>  * Foods rich in zinc can also help to keep bacteria under control and prevent bad breath.<br>  <br>  All of these remedies are very good so if you have no luck with them there could be another cause that you will need to see your doctor to get diagnosed so that you can take the necessary steps to heal yourself and heal your bad breath.|`|8LISL0LOaa	Make a paste with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Brush your teeth with this paste at least twice a day. Baking soda eliminates odors and the peroxide kills bacteria.<br>  <br>  Combat odor Combat odor Take one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar BEFORE eating, to avoid bad breath after a meal.<br>  <br>  Drink Tea Drink Tea Drinking chamomile tea in the morning can help relieve the wretched “morning breath”.<br>  <br>  Take acidophilus and bifidus, otherwise known as probiotics. If you have persistent bad breath not caused by mouth odor, the culprit is likely your digestive tract. You probably have a yeast overgrowth in your stomach and intestines. You can find these in most health food stores and certain pharmacies.|`|joZFVMrOaa	chewing regular gum can make your breath worse in the long run<br>  because of the saliva you are producing more as you chew<br>  try mints<br>  or maybe its your teeth <br>  my sister had the same problem , she had a rotting tooth in the back of her mouth causing it|`|wtVSTuSuaa	Eat lots of raw garlic with horse radish and jalapeno peppers.

When you are going to need them, lay them out to thaw, it doesn't take  long to thaw, a couple of hours. I do this every week with my husband's lunch meat. Works great.

kLN5hx6paa	Well,<br>  <br>  There are alot of reasons that can cause a person to shake, I will explain a few reasons and explain what causes them and disapprove them.<br>  <br>  One: Some people are just like that, I knew a girl with nothing wrong with her that got the " shakes " as she called them. Its from going to hot and cold right away from example its summer and you walk into a cold house can cause it, If you shake when you do that well, then you know why.<br>  <br>  Two: Nerve damage, well this can be caused from getting hit, viruses, what have you. Well if you been checked out and you have no damage then this isn't a issue<br>  <br>  Three: Brain tumor, this one is a more rare one to have. Its kinda self - explanitory.<br>  <br>  Most likely one: Well your condition ( G6-PD ) since you wont have as much as body needs getting to your muscles, organs, etc. You will be shakey or have that " weak" feeling. My advice to you is make sure you stay on top of it so it doesn't get worst.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	low blood sugar makes you shake.  eat regular meals.  avoid food with high amounts of sugar.

59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	The problem is that you're under 18, so you can't get that kind of medical test done without your parent's permission.  Unless you're gong to declare yourself legally independent (through the courts--not a terribly easy process), you won't be able to do this.|`|TPLxJEkYaa	Whether you get the shot or get an x-ray, you'd probably have to go back to receive the results.  In either case, it really depends on how independent you are from your parents.  You'll probably need to have whatever health insurance card your parents have, if you live in a country like the US where healthcare is a fiasco like that.  I'd just call your family doctor and try to set up an appointment yourself.  You'd need to find your own way there, though, and all that jazz.  x-rays are also fairly expensive.<br>  <br>  It seems like it would be much easier to just have a conversation with you mom about why you'd like to stay on campus.|`|JtCiW6pKaa	hmm...I dont know for sure (depending on where you live) but I am 19 and I am able to get medical tests without my parents letting know. Since by law doctors cannot reveal any medical information to my (your) parents. But if you dont want them finding out at all, you'll have to pay for the test yourself (cash is best, hard to track) cause if you used your parents' insurance, say, they would find out. So basically pay for the test yourself and make sure that when they call for the results, that they ask for you and only talk to you.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little.|`|swTjhCznaa	TB=Tuberculosis??|`|jeZ1UJmLaa	Well you preatty much cant unless you have a few hundred dollars and your old enough to talk to a docter without your parents. but if you know somebody that is older then 18 that can help you. your screwed.|`|IjIcSNudaa	You can't you have to be 18.

769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	The presence of a white tongue coating is a common problem that can have a variety of causes. Sometimes white tongue coating is caused by the general buildup of dead skin cells. These cells may accumulate when the tongue isn't brushed regularly or under conditions of dehydration, particularly during the warm weather months when not enough water is being consumed.<br>  <br>  Another cause for a white tongue is oral thrush, caused by a fungus known as Candida. The presence of Candida, although not serious in and of itself, can indicate a weakened immune system. A tongue infection with Candida can occur after using antibiotics or steroid based medications. These medications cause thrush by allowing the fungus to overgrow on the tongue. <br>  <br>  Here's how to deal with a white tongue coating:<br>  <br>  Step 1) To distinguish an oral thrush infection from buildup of dead skin cells on the tongue, use a tongue depressor to gently scrape the white tongue coating. If the coating scrapes off and leaves a reddened area, it could be oral thrush. If you suspect oral thrush, contact your doctor. <br>  <br>  Step 2)  If the white tongue coating is due to a simple buildup of dead skin cells on the tongue, a thorough tongue cleaning can help the problem. To clean your tongue, apply a small amount of toothpaste to a soft toothbrush and use slow, brushing movements to brush the tongue moving from front to back with the toothbrush. You can also use a tongue scraper. When this is completed, rinse your mouth with warm water. <br>  <br>  Step3)  Now that you've removed the white tongue coating, you'll want to repeat this procedure every few days to ensure that the white tongue coating doesn't recur. It's also important to drink more water on a daily basis to help flush out any bacteria or debris that can collect in the grooves on the tongue. <br>  <br>  Step 4)  To prevent collection of more white debris on your tongue, rinse your mouth with a spoon of salt placed into a cup of warm water on a daily basis.|`|a1pmr73vaa	bactria and get a tongue scrapper bad!

UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.<br>  <br>  The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a>  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles. <br>  <br>  When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.<br>  <br>  You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/gainweight.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...</a>|`|cGnIZ7kfaa	well i guess you just have that body type where it goes to your belly. im sorry,  i know a girl who is like that but its much woirse, and she is very frustarted with it all the time.<br>  well you need to do muscle building exercise i assume. lots of swimming will give you shoulders.<br>  and pushups will help yoir chest.<br>  eat meat 3 times a week. make sure its kangaroo, thats the healthiest, yummiest, most environmentally friendly! <br>  good luck|`|QISIR2Ayaa	Right!

We use a condom during that window of ovulation.  So you have to find out what day of your cycle you ovulate.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take your temperature every day the moment you wake up before you get out of bed (that's your basal body temperature).  Graph your temp. every day on graph paper or in Excel.  When you see a dip, then a spike in temp, you'll know you've ovulated.  Your temp. will stay slightly elevated until your period.<br>  <br>  Also, put your finger up there and feel your cervix texture, height, and the differences in mucuos every day. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/ovulation-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/ovulat...</a><br>  <br>  This article explains the changes pretty vaguely, but it's a good overview.  <br>  <br>  I also use a little device called a saliva microscope (10 bucks on ebay).  Take your spit in the morning before you eat, drink, or brush your teeth and wipe it on the lens.  When it dries (I usually just check mine the next morning and note it on my graph paper) you can see random dots most of the time, but when you ovulate, you can see the saliva dry in a "ferning" pattern because of the increased estrogen levels in your body.<br>  <br>  By tracking changes for a couple of months, you can begin to learn when you ovulate and avoid unprotected sex around ovulation.  <br>  <br>  Obviously it isn't fool proof, because you might ovulate at different times every once in a while.  I found a lot of info on trying to conceive websites because these women want to know exactly when they're ovulating to increase their chances of pregnancy, but it helps to know if you want to avoid sex during that time too.  You'll have to research more, but this gives you a starting point at least!<br>  <br>  What ever you do DON'T EVER go on Depo Provera (injection).  I can testify to the horror stories myself because I took it for 3 years.  That's why I don't use chemicals either!!!  It's HORRIBLE!|`|dvevk1qbaa	yea....its called "pull out dummass" hehe<br>  <br>  or condoms and spermicide<br>  <br>  all pills are drugs, all of them have bad side effects<br>  <br>  its too bad that the side effects get down played so much.<br>  <br>  ((((((SERIOUS WARNING))))))) my friend who is 23 almost had a heart attack and could have died last yeat from taking the pill. she was a non smoker with NO history of health problems|`|8vbUOxjxaa	i dont take any. i know it is hard but me and my man try and not do it as much and use condoms or try and have sex right before and after having my period. it is completely stupid what i am doing, i am trying my best. but after i read all the neg side effects...like pages long, isaid what?? i couldnt believe my eyes. i say nay to that ****|`|5Vc1e0iPaa	I started with nuvaring a few months back and really like it.

Try it out and if you feel pain or pressure put it up and try again the next day.  You should be good for your concert.|`|MHzDbKy3aa	I'm pretty sure after a week or so the clots will be completely formed and set, and you won't be blowing them out, so you probably shouldn't have a problem. I'm just assuming though.

Take some midol or something else to deal with the cramping and just have a good time.
c3X2MyTAaa	Yes. When you are sexually excited your body becomes less sensitive. as an example, if you where to have a hurt wrist and u were to get sexually excited and had sex, or pleasured yourself, and you were to hit your wrist then you would feel less pain because your body is more focused on your "excitement".|`|ZJDQ1jTkaa	That's disgusting!

4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	I don't know anything about homeopathy, but I find that 5htp is excellent for depression and anxiety. Rhodiola Rosea is excellent for tiredness, stress and nervous exhaustion. Take the 5htp at night and the RR first thing in the morning. <br>  <br>  L-Theanine is good to help you calm down without causing sedation or tiredness. L-Theanine is found in green tea, but you can buy supplements. <br>  <br>  Magnesium is good for the functioning of the nervous system as is Vitamin B6. A lot of people are low in magnesium. Take a combined magnesium and calcium supplement if you can - take it at night. <br>  <br>  A good quality multivitamin/mineral may be helpful to you as stress can deplete the body of essential vitamins and minerals. <br>  <br>  Of course, get enough sleep, fresh air and exercise in addition to any supplements that you may choose to take. Avoid too much sugar and caffeine as well. Don't rely on caffeine to keep you awake to study - listen to your body and rest when you feel tired. <br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon.|`|AA11251285	I've been taking St. John's Wort and it's helping.<br>  Valerian might help you sleep better, but ONLY take it at night.<br>  Here are some good ideas:<br>  1. Do something that gets your heart rate up a bit like, walking, running, biking, and swimming.<br>  2.

If you READ the question you will SEE that this person has  been to the doctor already. They have been to a family doctor and are currently in Pain Management. You are a numb-skull. <br>  <br>  SECOND! Yahoo answers is here for a reason and that is to get help with any type of problem you may be having. Whether or not the person asking the question has been to the doctor not is not relevant. But the funny thing about this situation and your stupid idiotic comment is...THIS PERSON HAS BEEN THE DOCTOR MULTIPLE TIMES!!!!  Maybe the ask-er is looking for some advice from a person who may have been in a similar situation and has experienced similar symptoms...  <br>  <br>  I think it's ridiculous and RUDE of you to make these types of comments and what is more frustrating is you received 2 points for your stupid, ignorant, childish comment. You are sad and it's sad that you are a top contributor. Lame, Lame, Lame.

If it gets worse or starts to look scary go to the doctor and they can lance it to get out all of the infectious liquids.|`|rsigH7hkaa	Squeeze it with your knuckles to get any infection out, and continue to do what the other reply said :)
CuVnpxh3aa	It is very normal. Try sitting up more and when you have to stand up just stand for a short time, not long enough to get sick. Be sure to eat something light and get plenty of fluids. I would just walk to my kitchen then go back and sit down when I am sick so pick a short trip and walk there then back to sit down. Do it several times a day but rest between the walks so you don't get sick. Be sure to eat light, not enough to eat can cause you to feel ill when you stand as well. Hope you feel better soon.

Suck it up and get it finished.|`|UQYurvnYaa	you could ask the doctor or whatever and get it numbed before hand|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Try some Percogelsic right before you go to have it done.  Also and I don't know if you can use this or not, but there is this stuff called Ocean Potion and it has Lidocaine in it, it is actually for sunburn, but you might want to put some of that on it after it is done.  Lidocaine numbs the area, therefore it takes the sting out of the sunburn.
fqrE36YSaa	Anal sex for the first time is very painful. According to a friend of mine, she told me that she had problems going number 2 for few days. Also techinically, that area is only for exits and entrances. But according to some research, if you keep doing it, eventually everything will start to loosen up.|`|tpaoUt5Xaa	You did not indicate that you had Anal sex.

Often, people will go for years with these, wondering why they're tired all the time, thinking that they just need to get more sleep.  Other disorders, like hypothyroidism, can make you feel very lethargic and tired.<br>  <br>  So, I'd recommend talking to a doctor about it.

RjUWPz5daa	The best yogurt you can eat is homemade yogurt. Read about the health benefits of yogurt in this article. There's also one that has a recipe to make your own.  I've been doing it for a year now and would never go back to store bought yogurt.|`|bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	Try looking at "Kefir".<br>  <br>  Both kefir and yogurt are cultured milk products...<br>  <br>  ...but they contain different types of beneficial bacteria. Yogurt contains transient beneficial bacteria that keep the digestive system clean and provide food for the friendly bacteria that reside there. But kefir can actually colonize the intestinal tract, a feat that yogurt cannot match.<br>  <br>  Kefir contains several major strains of friendly bacteria not commonly found in yogurt, Lactobacillus Caucasus, Leuconostoc, Acetobacter species, and Streptococcus species.<br>  <br>  It also contains beneficial yeasts, such as Saccharomyces kefir and Torula kefir, which dominate, control and eliminate destructive pathogenic yeasts in the body. They do so by penetrating the mucosal lining where unhealthy yeast and bacteria reside, forming a virtual SWAT team that housecleans and strengthens the intestines. Hence, the body becomes more efficient in resisting such pathogens as E. coli and intestinal parasites.<br>  <br>  Kefir's active yeast and bacteria provide more nutritive value than yogurt by helping digest the foods that you eat and by keeping the colon environment clean and healthy.<br>  <br>  Because the curd size of kefir is smaller than yogurt, it is also easier to digest, which makes it a particularly excellent, nutritious food for babies, invalids and the elderly, as well as a remedy for digestive disorders.|`|h3W9JnGBaa	all of them are good for you but stay away from tubes and "kids" stuff like that<br>  <br>  fruits of course are great too and look for ANTI-OXIDANTS which boost immune system...<br>  <br>  and of course look for maybe lower fat, sodium and suger....

It also has wonderful effects on your skin.<br>  <br>  As I understand it, hyaluronic acid works by encouraging cells to reabsorb water.  I take it as a supplement on and off.  They also sell lotions that contain it.  It is pretty good in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Botox is a totally different thing and has many side effects...I would never do Botox!|`|yE2vM76naa	For several years I got botox for migraines (miracle stuff really, for headaches) though I'm too young to have creases in my forehead. I stopped getting it though because the surgeon was a little heavy handed with it once, and for several months everytime I laughed it looked like an animal bearing its teeth. Creepy. Also, I couldn't lift my head to do certain things....which was a real drag in say, yoga class.<br>  <br>  So I stopped, but it certainly did immobilize those muscles.|`|c0525648e7f1a8cbba7c650f4cec06ceaa	I don't know about hyaluronic, but botox is made from botulism!  The actresses who used to get it now have expressionless faces as they can't move their faces, so their careers are suffering.  It's also dangerous as if anything goes wrong it can mess up your face.
en9Xk0h2aa	Make targets of 5 lbs. So you have just over five little targets to aim for. Trust me, it's so much easier when you're focusing on small targets, rather than one huge target. You will give up if you focus on that two stone.<br>  <br>  Try to walk a mile a day. Two is even better. Just a nice, easy walk one day then the next walk more briskly. Alternate them each day. On the brisk walk you should have enough breath to talk, but too breathless to sing. That is the best speed for fat burning.<br>  <br>  As for meals, try to have porridge or cereal for breakfast, and for lunch and dinner have whatever you like, but only the size of your fist. Add on two handfuls of a mixed salad. No dressing obviously. Drink two litres of water throughout the day. Try to avoid fizzy drinks, even diet because they can make you crave sugar because of the chemicals.<br>  <br>  Snack on fruit, yoghurt and raw veg. And have a treat a day. Just a small chocolate bar like a Rocky or funsize bar won't hurt, and if you deny yourself food you crave you will binge on it. Trust me!<br>  <br>  That should do it! I'd like to lose a stone and five lbs so we can support each other, that is my weight loss plan, let's see if we can be slim for summer! Good luck.|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	My husband bought me some exercise DVDs a few years ago and I swear by them.  The first few work outs are the hardest but once you get over the first week you'll become addicted when you find how well you feel.  Also if you try to change your eating habits instead of telling yourself you're on a "diet" you have more of a chance of succeeding.  Don't deny yourself anything just don't over indulge and try to substitute for low fat stuff (this is definitely  case of the pot calling the kettle black, because once I start on something nice I find it really hard to stop!)  I have suffered bulimia and body dysmorphia disorder since I was a young teenager(I'm 30 now), so I'm all too familiar with feeling crap about my body.  Get an image of yourself in your mind of how you would like to look and accept that the weight won't come off by itself.  If only it did! If you want it to go then you have to do something for yourself.  It's a way to nurture yourself and show yourself some respect.  You deserve to feel good about yourself.  My 2 favourite DVDs are " Kates cardio combat"  and "The Hollywood Workout" The latter is a bit corny lead by 2 ultra fit American trainers, but it's really effective and the former is quite a quick boxercise type of thing with Kate Lawler.  It's really good and saved my life and my wedding day!!  Hope this helps and best of luck.  Remember you owe it to yourself to make yourself feel good! x|`|3AXlgGgUaa	Ohhh, i have lost 2 stone over the last year! Just the trick.<br>  <br>  Firstly - stop building it up to be this HUGE task... it isn't.

People that eat fat free foods tend to eat more then they normally would and usually it's the same amount of calories. If you eat the product with fat in it you wont be as hungry.

Bacteria are extracellular organisms that replicate by binary fission and belong to the prokaryotic kingdom. <br>   Most bacterial STDs are responsive to treatment with antibiotics, and are therefore considered "curable." However, remember that some bacterial STDs are not eradicated before they cause permanent physical damage. Also, bacteria have the ability to develop resistance to certain antibiotic therapies. Therefore, as with all STDs, prevention against bacterial STDs is the best strategy toward dealing with them. <br>   <br>  This section will discuss the four most prominent bacterial STDs: gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis and chancroid.

deYDbVDSaa	While there are many long scientific answers, it all comes down to two things:<br>  <br>  1. What you ate<br>  <br>  2. If you are sick<br>  <br>  Regarding #1, the bacteria that lives in your colon likes some foods better than others. If they get active, they can cause odors.<br>  <br>  If you are sick, your colon will not be working properly, and obviously that's not good for what's coming out.
FcbRUYExaa	You are stressed, just relax. Not to mention MOST people cannot remember their dreams. You will be able to imagine and think to yourself when you do not have all your thoughts jumbled up into one little space! And if after a week your head is still unable to concentrate on your own thoughts ideas imaginary places... you might want to consider asking your parents if there is anything can do! GOOD LUCK|`|6de52fda1c9609b3b48716e75756634faa	There are a lot of memory tricks out there.  I would keep a notebook with you.  if you are dreaming and you wake up and want to remember the dream -- write down what you remember -- do realize that when you dream you are deep in sleep and many people don't remember all the dreams they have.    Some of the memory tricks that you can do are: ACRONYMS (use each first letter from a group of words to form a new word); SENTENCES/ACROSTICS (use the first letter of each word you are trying to remember. Instead of making a new word, though, you use the letters to make a sentence);RHYMES & SONGS (.Rhymes and songs draw on your auditory memory and may be particularly useful for those who can learn tunes, songs, or poems easily);METHOD OF LOCI(What is essential is that you have a vivid visual memory of the path and objects along it. Once you have determined your path, imagine yourself walking along it, and identify specific landmarks that you will pass.);CHUNKING(creating "chunks" of numbers).;PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT ( repeating is still a great memory aid)|`|dcTo9eBgaa	are you eating the recommended amounts of nutrients?<br>  are you a druggie?<br>  are you getting enough sleep?<br>  drinking enough water?<br>  these could all be factors
XHdLQu9baa	As someone who has been on wellbutrin for nearly 6 years, I would say you'll start to experience minor withdrawal symptoms after about 3 or 4 days.  Although, you may not experience full-blown withdrawal for 2 or 3 weeks.  Just be careful though, this is not a medication you can come off of cold-turkey.

y9N3DsKBaa	An ant acid is used after you already have acid ie stomach ache. A acid controlller you take to prevent getting it in the first place. <br>     The doctor used to have my wife take ant acid (Tumbs) if she had upset stomach even though she also took cellcept. So this sticker is new. <br>     Doctors are human. This may just be a new research recommendation that he has not read up on yet. Or that he disagrees with. It is even possible the sticker was put on there by mistake.<br>     You should discuss this with your doctor and or pharmacist. It is part of their job to explain these things to you.<br>      Medicine is not an exact science. There is more science than art but the art is still in there. That is why they call it practicing medicine and why second opinions are often sought.

I was told to do no breathing through the mouth and to take really deep breaths through my nose while running. You should feel your chest move when breathe with your diaphragm.|`|th5SfrB9aa	I have the same problem. First off, try not to eat too much before exercising, and then when you're experiencing pain, put your hands palms down on top of your head and keep running. It distracts you from the pain and eventually they will be gone.
Ibx7MDmBaa	I don't think that it is the gallbladder, but I could be wrong. What I do know is that when I get really stressed out, i become very tense in my upper back. A warm bath/shower and a nice massage always helps ease the tension. I also experienced on and off pain in my upper right back and then one day it came on full force and I went to the doctor and she discovered I had severe scoliosis. (my back hurt from muscel movement.) So, I'm not saying you have it, but I am saying to try and take a warm bath or shower, relax, and if it doesnt get better by tomorrow, call the doctor.

nMtywIOHaa	What you are describing is the transitional phase between NREM (non-rapid eye movement) and REM (rapid eye movement).  During this transition your body is paralyzed as well as different parts of your brain become demodulated or deactivated as well as activated.  This deactivation and activation is one of the theorized reasons why we dream. One of the areas of your brain that becomes activated is the amygdala an area of the brain that deals with anxiety and fear.  This could explain for your vivid hallucinations of fearful events.  Also during this transition the prefrontal cortex part of our brain is demodulated which makes it hard to process new memories into long term memory.  This makes it hard to remember our dreams. Many other areas of our brain are involved in this transition, but in this case don't seem to be as important. <br>  <br>  What seems to be your problem is that if we are somehow conscious enough to remember this transition from NREM to REM we sometimes experience traumatic events such as paralysis or auditory and visual hallucinations.  These hallucinations are considered dreams just as they appear in REM but are in NREM and remembered because of the absence of prefrontal cortex demodulation.  The ability to dream in NREM is quite normal as 25% of our dreams are experienced during this phase of sleep, but your ability to remember them is not. This same type of event is experienced in patients that have REM behavior disorder (RBD) or sometimes called night terrors, but they have an absence of the paralysis aspect of the transition and act out their dreams.    <br>  <br>  As these dreams seem to be bothering you, it seems that they may have started to be remembered the event recently.  Different foods as well as stress levels can have a profound effect on our sleep and either help or disrupt this transitional phase.  Eating healthy, exercising, taking supplements that support the production of serotonin can all be healthy ways of supporting your sleep.  There could however be underlying problems such as tumors that are effect different areas of the brain to cause these types of problems. <br>  <br>  I would suggest visiting a doctor as problems with sleep seem to be indicators of possible serious deficiencies. Have them check magnesium levels and other possible areas for problems.  Also start working out more and eating better as your symptoms may start going away shortly after. <br>  <br>  If none of the information above helped you, feel free to visit a blog I post on at: <a href="http://lucidconsciousness.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://lucidconsciousness.blogspot.com/</a> and it has a large amount of information on different disorders as well as possible ways of helping individuals sleep better.  <br>  <br>  Happy Dreaming!|`|e90oXWlzaa	wao thats odd but poor of your mom xD|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	I would do some research on Lucid Dreaming.

lcuxD3qlaa	I’m a Vegetarian and I’m super thin, and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll ...and I have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  I bareeeely work out ....and I’ve never had a belly, big thighs, or big butt SO Listen k? I'm pretty much perfect; 5'2 96 pounds<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!? (Kosher aisle)<br>  Mott’s applesauce, no added sugar is one of my favorite things to eat too!<br>  You can find organic applesauce too which provide different flavors without added sugar<br>  All “no added sugar” products are phenomenal<br>  <br>  NOTE: BEEF, Oh my god -it is very bad for you and does not leave your intestine for months and months (look it up on internet...it’s the worse food for you-unless used in moderation and VERY VERY small portions)<br>  <br>  Brown rice or even white rice is great too<br>  Miso soups are fantastic as well as any other soups (especially the ones with very little sodium)<br>  <br>  Fruit is ALWAYS a great snack at night!<br>  <br>  Ok, that’s all I can think about now off the top of my head, if you need to know anymore then just message me k?<br>  <br>  Take care<br>  <br>  (I know I went on a rampage here, but I honestly hope this helps!)<br>  <br>  xoxoxox

And whats worse is that everyone is so willing to run and find a lawyer to sue!  This is the reason people don't want to become doctors anymore!

ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido.

Whole eggs.  fats like these are "filling".  Get more fiber in your diet.  Eat more complex carbs like oats, sweet potatoes.  <br>  <br>  Keep carbs to only morning and around workouts/training.

0FSBiLQVaa	When you first get your period, it will be irregular. It is because when you first get it, your body is still getting used to the monthly cycle. It will start getting regular is a year or so, give or take. If you do not want to be taken by surprise, you should always keep a pad or tampon with you, just in case. A great website is www.beinggirl.com.|`|n1xJOcjUaa	You really won't know when you will get it! If your periods have just started recently they may not be regular. Only advice is to carry sanitary towels/tampons, it is unlikely that the very start of the period will be heavy, and you should catch it in time to make it through the school day. More than likely you will get cramps just before it starts, if you get cramps, maybe start wearing liners incase.|`|KsM6cWipaa	In your first few years, the occurance of your period is very irregular, it doesnt develop a set pattern till later on in life. So when it doesnt come exactly one month later, dont worry about it.  The first few times its hard to tell when it will come again, just look for signs you had the first time, and always be prepared, carry pads in your purse or backpack.|`|KnZW05kfaa	Typically it comes every 28 to 32 days.  But it seems to have a mind of its own too, don't start stressing too much until you reach a week or so past the date your suppose to start.

jpA71Js1aa	your bodies chemistry changes when your sugars go too low and im not sure exactly what the dogs detect but they work with you specifically so the dog knows you and your body, i was in contact with an organization who trains these dogs but they were too far away for me, the purpose of the dog is to alert you before you get into a state you cannot handle on your own, when they begin to drop. as far as the person being mean and drunk acting and having to force things on them, that is how my dad acts and he acts that way because he can no longer detect his low sugars, it s called hypoglycemia unawarness and if youve had the disease for a while or you dont control your sugars well and they go low often, you can sort of build up a tolerance to them and no longer feel them, when a person starts acting drunken, their sugars are generally at a dangerously low level because they didnt detect the early stages of it themselves, the shakes, the vision, the warmth.  it is a person like that who would benefit tremendously from one of these dogs, they could alert them b4 they got too far gone.  some of them can also be trained on special phones to speed dial 911 if their owner is in a coma state, they really are amazing and i wish they were more readily available.|`|tHwK0gdFaa	I don't know about dogs, but I've been living with a person who has Diabetes for 15 years now... Even if a dog is trained to detect the low sugar level in the blood, I don't think it could do better than bark. When sugar level falls person first starts to act like drunk, after that, he stops seeing things properly, after that he has something like an epileptic shock and then goes coma. If you won't help person in first two phases he might die. Be careful, person becomes aggressive,  the best way to make a sugar level immediately rise is to melt lots of sugar in water and make the person to drink it. You have to use force. So be patient, and try not to leave a person alone for long, especially first few months.|`|b11139bea6cf9bf7d68eec6d2cfdff65aa	With a lot of diabetics, if they have a hypo (low sugar levels) they become sweaty and have a slightly sweet smell to the sweat.<br>  <br>  I think it is this smell that dogs pick up on, in the same way as police dogs pick up on the smell of drugs.<br>  <br>  In fact, my husband will sniff at me if he thinks I am having a hypo - which can get some very strange looks if we are in a public place - but can be a lot quicker than digging my test kit out of my handbag.<br>  <br>  (Was my husband a dog in a former life ? lol)

I'm pretty much perfect; 5'2 96 pounds<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get.

There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!? (Kosher aisle)<br>  <br>  Mott’s applesauce, no added sugar is one of my favorite things to eat too!<br>  You can find organic applesauce too which provide different flavors without added sugar<br>  All “no added sugar” products are phenomenal<br>  <br>  NOTE: BEEF, Oh my god -it is very bad for you and does not leave your intestine for months and months (look it up on internet...it’s the worse food for you-unless used in moderation and VERY VERY small portions)<br>  <br>  Brown rice or even white rice is great too<br>  Miso soups are fantastic as well as any other soups (especially the ones with very little sodium)<br>  <br>  Fruit is ALWAYS a great snack at night!<br>  <br>  Ok, that’s all I can think about now off the top of my head, if you need to know anymore then just message me k?<br>  <br>  Take care<br>  <br>  (I know I went on a rampage here, but I honestly hope this helps!)<br>  <br>  xoxoxox|`|tdwzQ6JAaa	Cut off all your sugar intake. Meaning, stop drinking sodas (even diet), fruit juices, and basically anything with excess sugar. Stick with water. <br>  <br>  Second, stop eating deep fried or heavily starched food. Watch your carbohydrate intakes (white rice, white bread, regular pasta, etc.) <br>  <br>  All this stuff gives you the extra warmth thickness in winter, but we have jackets now, so no need to have the extra layer.<br>  <br>  Second, do cardio first thing in the morning before you eat anything. And if you do have to eat, eat lightly. Working out before your morning meal will burn fat more effectively rather than any other time of the day. This is because all you energy (glycogen) stores are drained out in the morning from fasting (break-fast). This will make your body use you fat stores for energy. The only reason why I say if you do eat, eat lightly, is because some people can't handle working out on an empty stomach. Most can. <br>  <br>  And it's not a race. It's a lifestyle, so don't think you're going to drop any more than 5lbs a week. A safe drop would be 2.5-3lbs a week. The slower the better (usually 2lbs/week is ideal). If you lose weight too fast, your body will not adapt and it will throw off your metabolism. It will also increase your chances of yo-yoing your weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Go for a jog in the morning, or even just dance around your room for 30 minutes a day.|`|yvAyaiMdaa	OK you want me to stick to it. Well starving your self won't make you lose the weight you want and keep it off. When you starve your self your body will shout down and keep all of the food that you do eat and store it as fat.  The thing to remember is it take 3500 calories to gain 1pound. So you have to burn more calories then you eat. I have been eating 1200-1300 calories aday and burning more then 2700 calories aday so at the end of the week I will have lost 2# per week, and that is the best way to lose it low and slow so it won't come back, but you have to exercise.

From what your saying, you are not fat. Girls today look like toothpicks, and its better to look normal  than a toothpick. Compared to them, it would look like your fat because you are normal and they are toothpicks. But for you as a 7th grader, I'd say dont eat alot of fats and sugars, and excerise and do sports. That is the best thing for you to do. Check your BMI on the link. Down at Source. P.S: I know you said dont talk about the starving issue.

fk9AvB25aa	There is only a slight chance of getting herpes when there is no out break.<br>  Fingering would not necessarily pass it on unless she had herpes on her fingers (which is not common to have), or touched an out break then with in seconds touched you after. Better yet if she or you gave each other oral sex you could pass cold sores on that way as well.<br>  Your chances of getting herpes when there is an out break is much greater then when there isn't one. Herpes is usually at it's most contagious point when there are any signs of an out break.<br>  She would have to give you oral sex at least and it could take only seconds to pass herpes on.<br>  But since you and her both have cold sores then you would be less likely to get them any where else, but it could still happen.<br>  Knowing you have herpes does put a toll on your mental state some times, it can make you feel gross or dirty for having it. Just know that your not alone if you do. 50-80 percent of the world has cold sores and 1 in 5 adults have genital herpes. Cold sores are easily passed on by kissing some one who has them. At least you would know one way or the other and it might calm you down some. If you know you have them then at least you can find out what to do to help prevent spreading them. Some people who have herpes have no idea that they have it and don't know that they are spreading it.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	It's quite possible.

The sugar you put in is probably the worst thing though, if you're trying to lose weight. That's 18 teaspoons of added sugar a day, about as much sugar as a couple cans of coke. Maybe switch to decaf and curb the sugar.

For the price, you can create your own weight loss supplement using all natural and healthy, beneficial ingredients! This will help keep the weight off too, which is a big problem with weight loss pills, because usually the weight will come right back after you stop taking the product. And who can afford buying that every month?! Not to mention, do you really even know what those ingredients in it are? Generally, all weight loss products contain the same basic ingredients but also throw in a bunch of extra garbage that God only knows what it is doing to your body. Also, the amount of the active ingredients in these products is not nearly enough to make it worth taking. They are pretty much fancied up caffeine pills! <br>  Try some natural weight loss solutions- you may be pleasantly surprised! :)<br>  The site below gives you some great tips on where to start!!! Good luck!
LV75kgwraa	I am very farsighted but I'm actually presbyopic (I wear multifocals & can't see anything up close). Here's my suggestion:<br>  <br>  Do you have eyeglasses? Hopefully you do. USE THEM! It may be a pain, but put your eyeglasses on to see the contact lens. When you have it on your finger and it's right side out, take your glasses off and insert the lens in your eye. Very simple, I do it every morning. Once you have the first lens in, use THAT eye (while closing the other eye of course) to check the other lens on your finger. Once you've checked it, insert it in the other eye.<br>  <br>  If you don't have any eyeglasses then you can play the "guessing game". This would be to actually insert the lens in your eye and wait for a moment. If it feels like you have an eyelash in your eye, chances are the lens is inverted. Then you'll have to take it out and flip it. Insert it again and wait to see if it feels comfortable. This is more of a pain (not to mention time consuming), and can cause some irritaion to your eyelids and cornea. So I don't really like suggesting this. But without any back up eyeglasses what else can you do? Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Almost forgot! Keep in mind, your finger should always be dry and the inside of the contact lens should be wet (but not too wet). It will never stick to your finger if you remember that golden rule!|`|vv6ig0ssaa	If its inside out they have flaps....Here is my trick 1.put it on ur finger. 2.bend your finger back without ur finger just bend it back with your finger 3. you will see that its right, u can tell.|`|FulXepd0aa	There are several ways to tell if contact lense is inside out. before putting your contacts in put your glasses on to see waht you are doing,.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. make sure your finger is dry put it on tip of your fingeer if the shape is like bowl it is the right side. <br>  if the edges curves out like soccer it is the wrong side. <br>  contat lense if it is wrong sied they feel scratchy.<br>  <br>  best and simple example <br>  take your contact lense put it on fold of your hand like wheen you fold your hand theere is a crease on your hand put your contact on that crease fold the hand it it stays up like taco shell it is right side if ti flips over and touches the side it is wrong side.|`|JtkgzXVEaa	you have to look reaally close. that's what i do anyways :P also, you're going to want to make sure your finger is dry while you're putting on your contacts so it doesn't stick to your finger. for me, if the contact is wrong in my eye it itches really bad. but yeah; the right side up should be bowl shaped and not sticking out around the edges :)
48EnilWqaa	In all honesty, the weight gain is visible, but you don't have to stress out about it because you can lose it through a healthy diet and exercise. Instead of running, try walking.

SS5py9jIaa	Some guys are never going to be really lean. It is genetically difficult for them. Also, we are born with a limited number of fat cells and these swell to capacity... and then divide.. and swell again. When you lose fat those fat cells shrink but do not dissapear. That's why it is easier for a person who was once fat to get fat again... and those fat cells have a certain mass... sitting just underneath the skin and as you say.. feel like loose skin.<br>  <br>  I recommend that he concentrates on growth ... so do three workouts a week at a gym and put on some beef... here's a routine to begin with:<br>  <a href="http://www.redbak.net/pages/beginner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.redbak.net/pages/beginner.htm...</a> The additional muscle mass will help burn off the fat his body is storing in each of those fat cells.<br>  <br>  There is no way to target particular areas of fat by exercise... so you are better off doing exercises that work large muscle groups to burn off the most stored energy.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Crunches, not fun but effective, no kidding.

s2F6pK9Xaa	Mine were hurting me for like a year before I finally couldn't take it anymore and agreed to have the surgery. I had never had ANY surgery before,so like you, I was scared shitless too. I was 23 when I finally had it done. I had my mom take me there, and I paid the few extra bucks for nitros oxide to help me relax. It was so worth it! I highly recommend that.<br>  <br>  They made me watch a vross video befor that scared the crap outof me...but then...<br>  <br>  I remember getting the nitros gas, then they told me to count backwards from 100...I only made it to 99.<br>  <br>  Then my mom was waking me up. I felt like I had just had the best sleep of my life. I also remember telling her in a groggy voice that I couldn't wake up yet 'cause I was going to have surgery! She laughed...it was over already and I could go home.<br>  <br>  The recovery wasn't even bad! I ate soft stuff for a week and didn't drink anything out of a straw...but other than that, I had NO problem WHATSOEVER. If I had known a year before how easy it would have been, I wouldn't have put it off! It was perfect and I don't regret a thing- except that I worried too much beforehand!<br>  <br>  Relax, you'll be just fine. The doctors do this so often, it's unreal. You'll be in good hands.|`|JX9gAD7oaa	I was absolutely petrified going in for surgery to have my 4 wisdom teeth extracted (2 were impacted - one in the bone perpendicular to the 2nd molar!!) - purely because of all the stories I had read in these forums!! And to tell you the truth - it is not bad as many people make it sound!! In fact nothing compared to what I've read here!!! So dont worry at all!! I had mine done last week on Monday - and the stitches came out today!<br>  <br>  There is obviously a risk when extracting the lowers one (in particular if they are badly impacted)...... the nerve which controls sensation in parts of your lower lip, tongue and chin may be disturbed which may result in a temporary loss of sensation, and in rare cases permanent loss. Your dental surgeon/oral surgeon will obviously inform you of this risk. I was VERY worried when 3hrs after my surgical extraction, I still couldn't feel my lower lip, tongue or chin.  I thought that the anaesthesia would have worn off by then, and feared that the nerve was in fact disturbed.  However after 6hrs the anaesthesis did wear off - and I was SO HAPPY that I regained sensation in my lower lip, tongue and chin (that was the only scary part!!).<br>  <br>  So dont worry if after the surgery your chin, lip and tongue are still numb - its normal, and it takes time for the anaesthesia to wear off.<br>  <br>  I had it done under local anaesthesia - felt absolutely no pain whatsoever, not even after the surgery.  I took advil prior to the surgery, and then after the surgery every 4 hrs.  I was given antibiotics to take for 5 days.  To be perfectly honest, what hurt the most was removing the stitches (which was today - one week after extraction!). That was the only pain I had experienced - through out this whole process (from actual surgical removal, post surgery to stitches being removed). Bear in mind my case was complex - even my dentist was surprised at how easily the recovery process for me was.<br>  <br>  I had a bit of a swelling 48hrs after the surgery which only lasted a couple of days.  Make sure that right after your surgery you apply ice packs for a period of 20 minutes, 20 off intermittently. <br>  <br>  Regarding post extraction diet - you'll be on liquids and anything soft/mushy (perfect oppourtunity to loose weight ;-)   )  Mash potatoes, joghuts, smoothies, milkshakes, soups - dont have any rice, or fruits with seeds inside, as they may risk getting clogged in the sockets where the wisdom teeth were, and increase the risk of an infection. Trust me this is the last thing you want to have!!<br>  <br>  Make sure that during the first 24hrs of extraction, you dont spit ANYTHING from your mouth.  You'll have some bleeding, but you're supposed to swallow (I know its gross!!).  This is done so that the blood clot can form.  And no sucking through straws - at least for a week to be on the safe side!!!<br>  <br>  After the first 24hrs, you can start brushing your teeth - obviously exercising caution in the areas near the wounds. You'll be asked to rinse your mouth a few times a day with salt water (1tsp salt dissolved in a glass of warm water).   <br>  <br>  Dont be scared at all - if you follow all the instructions given to you by whoever will be extracting the wisdom teeth you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Oh and here's a tip - if you're going to have your wisdom teeth extracted under local anaesthesia, make sure you take your MP3 player/iPod with you, so as to block the drilling noises (which may make you feel uneasy - remember you wont feel any pain - just pressure!!!).|`|6911e70a06ed4c44c8103d034e0b69aaaa	Well I just had mine pulled all of them including the three that were impacted. I'm hoping yours are not. This was difficult for me since I live in fear of the dentist. Seriously, If did not feel I had to have them pulled I would have lived the rest of my life without going to the dentist. I floss and brush three times a day, not because I'm anal but because if I do so it lessens the chance of me going to the dentist. Ever. So far my record for not going to dentist stands at five years. I hope to improve on that record. The reason I mention all this is that I too was scared beyond all belief to be there.  I chose to be unconscious for the event. Your insurance may not cover that (mine didn’t) but it’s worth entirely every penny. I wouldn't do it any other way. The process is fairly quick. Mine was about an hour. I had to sign some disclosure forms which did not help my nerves as they cover every possibility that can occur. Most of these are bad. Infections, loss of feeling in face etc. in defense of the surgeon they have to let you be aware of every scenario even the unlikely ones (in case you are attacked by rabid beavers during the surgery, rabies may result. If the office is hit by a meteorite during your visit numbness may occur, etc.)<br>  Before I went in I was twitchy, hands shaking, talking too much and too loud etc.<br>  Nothing went wrong (as near as I can tell any way.), but I do feel the office was not keen on telling me all I needed to know. For example, you will not be going to work to day of the surgery. Or the day after. And don't count on solid food for a few days afterwards.  Really it took me about 5 days to get to normal. And Soup gets real old quick.<br>  What went right-hey, I breathe a lot better now, my jaw does not have that pressurized feeling that didn’t even notice until after it was gone.<br>  The anesthia was fine (Doctor this will take about three breaths to take affect. Me: One count, two count, Hey Doc you’re right I can start to fee..........snore.) I recovered no worries and all that crap they scared me with didn’t happen. No infections, no losses of feeling, no jaw decay anything. I feel great. And I never ever have to do that again. Hooray!<br>  My advice-<br>  If you get a choice do 'em all at once. Don’t think I'd be cool going back.<br>  Ask questions. The office was like oh, no problem you’ll be out in 45 minutes, nothing to worry about. Right before you go under is not the time to find out that side effects can include major life-threatening infection and paralysis. And that you have to take anti-biotics for month. And that you will need a couple of prescriptions filled on the way home.<br>  Take time off-I took three days. I could have taken four.<br>  Do not plan to drive. I don’t remember too much of the first day. I doubt I could have ridden the bus, let alone took the wheel.<br>  Sock up on soup, gelatin, etc. before going in. When you get out you won't feel like shopping. Alas beer does not count as clear liquid. Also get some good DVD's games etc. to distract yourself afterward.<br>  Follow the doctor’s advice-if he says to take pain pills or antibiotics take them all. Don’t stop 'cause you think its getting better.<br>  If your wife, husband or children are home tell them over and over again how it was. Why should you have to suffer alone? Note-the spouse may exhibit irritability related to the operation. After I showed her my teeth and gauze (the doctor let me keep them. We don't know why.) for the sixth time in half an hour she threw them away. Otherwise I would show them to you.<br>  In summary it was a neccessary evil.|`|AIPJBq5Faa	I was in so much pain, I wanted to kill myself|`|FGm4dLinaa	Ok, so I just got mine out about 4 days ago. I was pretty scared when I got there and when I sat down in the chair and they started hookin me up to all these monitors, blood pressure machines, and the IV. But the nurses were extremely friendly and helped to calm me down.<br>  <br>  I remember seeing the nurse inject the anesthesia into my IV and thinking oh no they are about to start and I'm not asleep yet...but they didn't even have time to get me to count backwards before I was completely out. And it was neat too! You get this wierd tingly feeling all over and then it feels like the ceiling is falling- seriously, the best stuff ever!<br>  <br>  When i woke up I was pretty out of it and stayed out of it until a few hours later.<br>  <br>  The pain wasn't too bad, the worst part is just not being able to eat and feeling sluggish from the meds. But you get to work your way up to normal food so I totally intend on eating whatever but the end of this week! <br>  <br>  Overall, it's seriously not bad and it's over super fast- you won't remember a thing! Good Luck and God Bless! :)|`|aR0hjmKoaa	i got mine out when i was in first grade and i still remember it like it was yesterday.. i remember they made my mom hold me down after they pulled the first one because the pain cant even be expressed in words<br>  but i don't know if it was just because i was little kid but i know it hurts alot <br>  have fun.|`|ZRVxc4haaa	My brother got his out last year.

Piece of cake, very little discomfort even afterwards. Took all of about ten minutes for the dentist, from the first injection of local to me walking out the door.<br>  Bottom right came out in 1993. Bit more of a problem then the first two, but still relatively easy. <br>  I began to wonder where all the horror stories were.<br>  Then the last one, in 2000. I ended up with an oral surgeon and a dentist both having their hands in my mouth. It was a painful nightmare.<br>  And I was in serious pain for days afterward, but more from getting beat up by the dentists than from the tooth!<br>  They should be able to tell you whether or not they may be difficult, based on the x-rays. If it looks difficult, they may give you the option to be anesthesized.<br>  Good luck.|`|yQqbULPLaa	They told me i had to also, but i asked if there was anything i could do besides removing my teeth, because i have to keep them, i refuse to pull them out, and the dentist did a minor gum removing surgery back in the back of my mouth so that when i closed my mouth i wasn't chewing the gum anymore.<br>   Fixed the problem! Don't let them bully you! <br>  They also told me the gum sometimes will grow back, but it has been like 5 years and i have had no problems, so far all is good. try and keep your teeth, they are only trying to make money. good luck.

CkN4pgpCaa	You need to do cardio and weight training together.  They are both so important to lose weight and become stronger and healthier.  If you do too much cardio you can start to burn off you muscles- something you don't want!  Focus on balancing your workouts- start with at least 20 minutes of cardio and follow up with weight training while your heart rate is still up.  Your muscles need toning and working out even before you get to your goal weight!|`|T0Mqy1fXaa	you may be gaining weight more easily because of your muscle atrophy.

But muscle is denser than fat, so you could be losing fat even if you seem not to be losing weight, or even gaining slightly. Don't just go by weight alone; do you like what you see in the mirror? Are you slimier?<br>  <br>  BTW, if you are drinking energy drinks or eating energy bars after working out, check the calories on the label. Many sports drinks and sports bars are just as fattening as candy or soda.

PTK2x59Kaa	chill, your wait can fluctuate about 3.5 lbs every day so every day you're probably 102 and 105 today you just noticed.<br>  Also it is just bloating if your stomaches 3inchs more now than<br>  it was and you're only 3 more pounds then you were, than it's obviously<br>  not all from those 3 lbs think about it if 24 inches was your normal at 102 and when you gained 3lbs you gained 3 inches than if you weighed 140   (which i do and i'm still skinny) you'd be<br>  62 inches around, and well i think we both understand that that is not true. Also about thatat pound you lost you probably didn't loose it, it was jsut your wait fluxuating.<br>  <br>  Once you've lost or gained like 5 lbs, or tracked how and when your weight fluxuates you shouldnt worry about it at all.|`|q6MDThTSaa	dont worry just wait a day or so it will go away. might take more|`|qiLKlSmHaa	You need to think about what you're doing that is different...have you slowed or stopped exercising?  Are you eating more sweets or larger portions?  Not to be gross...but are you maybe constipated...this especially can cause your belly to swell.  A healthy approach may solve any of these issues...be sure you are getting exercise to burn calories and to keep your metabolism and system moving, avoid sweets or junk food if you're loading up on them and try to avoid binding foods and eat high fiber foods, like fruits, veggies and good grains, and lastly drink lots of water to flush your body out.  If you continue to have issues, then its time to see the doctor.|`|Ndh3oc98aa	start exercising more|`|m2BCAdD3aa	check your tiroid glandule
lzjtINvCaa	this is a old home remedy about 10 yrs ago I had a severe tooth ache on the weekend of course my uncle told me to take ground cloves and pack it a round the sore tooth being in severe pain and being on the weekend I was desperate so I tried it and to my amazement it worked like a charm you can also buy it in a bottle oil of cloves.  hope this is helpful|`|c3be98a378a7f478cc0867a107078db7aa	put a whole clove on the area and hold it on with your tongue.  its weird but it works.|`|hsyrqw6paa	ICheck the drugstore for clove oil, or "toothache cure".  Dab it on the tooth with a cotton swab.
nAp688tZaa	This should be on the prescription from the doctor.  If it is not, then you need to call his office and find out.  But, you should only take the new medication exactly as he prescribed it.  The liquid may be stronger than the pill form of the medication.  It will also hit your system a lot faster than the pill would.  Ask the pharmacist to go over the dosing instructions with you very carefully before you leave the store with the medication.  If you don't understand then ask questions until you do.
ZrPAKjd5aa	you should focus on your diet.  get rid of fast food...at your size your stomach will take care of itself.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	cut out fast food sweets soda dairy juice red meat and don't add salt to anything and exercise daily|`|nRB121B9aa	You should be able to get a flat stomach easily.

If so, then it's your phone.  If you're having trouble hearing everything, then you should see a doctor.  It could be something as simple as a wax blockage, or it could be something that needs to be taken care of right away to prevent permanant damage if it hasn't already happened.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	you can barely hear him because he lives far away and your phone is a piece of poo.<br>  <br>  and no, you're not going "death" because that would mean you need to have someone plan your funeral. and you're not going "deaf" from talking on the phone either..lol|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Yes, we all die someday.|`|iEVEfPaVaa	Loss of hearing will not kill you but I suspect you already know that.  Start with a new cell phone (I assume you are talking about a cell).  No one needs to talk on a piece of S H I T.  If you still have trouble hearing make sure the area that sounds come through is lined up with your ear.  I find that some cell phones are hard to do that because they are so small.  If you still have problems you might want to see your doctor.   I suspect it is full of wax and will need to be cleaned out by the doctor.  Don't try to clean it out with a q-tip.  It is too easy to puncture your eardrum.

pkSNFO5paa	Hi, you actually don't have scoliosis. Scoliosis is a curve greater than 10 degrees, and because yours is only 7, you don't have it. Curves less than 10 degrees are fairly common in the population. I wouldn't worry about it, because my guess is that your the only one who notices it because scoliosis usually doesn't start becoming noticeable until about 20 degrees. If your still growing, than I would just have your doctor check your spine once a year. Good luck!|`|c68nVKIYaa	Shannon is correct, the current definition of scoliosis is curvature greater than 10 degrees, and smaller curvatures are pretty common and usually don't get worse. <br>  <br>  However, I would keep an eye on it. <br>  <br>  If it does get worse, there is a home remedy, but generally you need some professional training to learn the exercises that you perform daily at home. See the Yahoo Answers thread below.
9pLdhuBnaa	This could have been caused by being stressed about something (an example only).<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.
AA10169678	It's possible it's eczema, but it's also possible (and likely, considering that it smells) you have a fungal infection from not drying the area adequately after you take a shower. If that is the case, it's unwise to put Vaseline on it-- you want it to dry out, not stay moist.<br>  Rubbing alcohol will help it dry out. Apply some after drying behind your ears. It should clear up in a week or so.|`|vLAaeKmdaa	That is just eczema. If you research it, it will come up as a disease. Don't worry, all it is is basically really dry skin. I had it behind my ears as well, although mine didn't smell or anything. It was just dry skin and my dermatologist gave me cream to put on it and it went away. If you don't go to the dermatologist, just use vaseline. That should work fine.|`|Dy4JAL9Qaa	ewww...<br>  never happened to me before<br>  sounds gross

ZcfZx60aaa	hey there, <br>  <br>  You could be having diarrhea as a result of the amoxicillin...it is a common side effect, or from whatever you were sick with. My advice to you would be to drink plenty of fluids so you don't become dehydrated (ex. gatorade-has TONS of electrolyes). Also, you can try eating some cheese....it will help "block" you up.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be concerned if I were you, but if the diarrhea doesn't stop within 4-5 days you may want to make an appointment with your MD, as you might have some sort of bacteria in your GI tract (c-diff, etc).<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better soon!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it should clear up. it could be infection.|`|v7Ohcbvhaa	What did you have the flu?

HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  I was always a 36D, now I still can use 36D's, but I now fit into my C's. My boobs have got abit smaller, but it's okay, because I'm slimmer so it's all good. Just think, would you rather be fat with big boobs, or slim with biggish boobs??<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|eHiwylo7aa	Unfortunately females tend to lose weight on the upper portion of their body before the thigh/abdomen/leg region.  Chances are a lot of the weight will be lost from the chest, but not all.  Cardio exercises like running, walking, biking, swimming, etc. will help in losing the weight evenly throughout your body.|`|JUrcvLklaa	Targeted wieght loss is not possible, you will lose weight all over your body, but different people lose weight in different ways...<br>  <br>  Personally, i have lost almost 15-20 pounds (medical problems), and my breasts have actually gone UP a cup size!  I do not know if I am just a freak (yes i proudly admit i am a freak at times), or if it could be due to the fact that I am only 18 and have heard of breasts growing up to in the mid-twenties...  Whether it was from a growth spurt, or not , i will probably never know...

AA11599407	First I don't think you consulted a doctor, they NEVER prescribe over the phone for a first time yeast. I think you have self medicated. Couple things come to mind, either it is not a yeast and you need other treatment or you are allergic to the product. Either way you need an actual appointment for proper diagnosis and treatment.|`|hdBMsEbnaa	I had the same problem.. It was the monistat some women tough it out but I couldn't I used it twice and I was worse than before I used it. I ended up finally getting diflucan..  then I get bacterial vaginosis from using the Monistat becaused it changed my ph flora and my ob/gyn so my dr gave me flagyl which caused another yeast infection. Good luck! Go see your ob/gyn.|`|75MFPsEIaa	Monistat 3 you can buy over the counter, I would know, i've purchased this too.  Probably what happened is that you waited a little longer than you should have and so it seems that the symtoms got worse with the medicine, but they would have gotten worse no matter what.  You should start seeing more results after about 48 hours.  Also don't be freaked out if you get a huge cottage cheese discharge one day after inserting the ovule thing.  It's really gross, but normal on the medication.  If you don't see any difference after day 3 or 4 make an appointment.  Good luck.  Yeast Infections are miserable!!!

3tuwWidiaa	Yes, I agree with his decision.
pvYy6iTSaa	Muffin - What you describe is called dementia, and is often seen in aged persons.  What does it mean when someone is said to have dementia? For some people, the word conjures up scary images of “crazy” behavior and loss of control. In fact, the word dementia describes a group of symptoms that includes short-term memory loss, confusion, the inability to problem-solve, the inability to complete multi-step activities such as preparing a meal or balancing a checkbook, and, sometimes, personality changes or unusual behavior.<br>  <br>  Saying that someone has dementia does not offer information about why that person has these symptoms. Compare it to someone who has a fever: the person is ill from the fever, but the high temperature does not explain the cause or why this person is ill.<br>  <br>  Does any loss of memory signify dementia? Isn’t memory loss a normal part of aging? We often hear that because someone is old, memory problems are “just natural” and are to be expected.  But we know that serious memory loss is not a normal part of aging, and should not be ignored. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, families might assume that a loved one’s noticeable loss of memory must be caused by Alzheimer’s disease. In many instances, Alzheimer’s is, in fact, the problem. But other conditions also can cause memory and cognitive problems severe enough to interfere with daily activities. These conditions can affect younger as well as older people. A clear diagnosis is needed.<br>  <br>  Certain conditions can cause reversible dementias. These include medication interactions, depression, vitamin deficiencies or thyroid abnormalities.  It is important that these conditions be identified early and treated appropriately so that symptoms can  be improved. <br>  <br>  The irreversible dementias are known as degenerative dementias, and Alzheimer’s disease is the most common.  There are a number of other degenerative dementias, however, that may look like Alzheimer’s, but have distinct or different features which need special attention and different treatment.

Also it is a different work out that your muscles aren't used to. It is recommended that you switch exercises occasionally because the muscles get used to them. <br>  <br>  As for the thighs I am in the same boat. But then again i used to work out everyday and still never had toned thighs or abs. Damn genetics! :)|`|Dvawm8Ezaa	thigh master ? or if you have a gym membership there are usually machines to tone inner/outer thighs at the same time.|`|7585zXZIaa	Well  you have to run but also do this multiple times a day:<br>  lay on your left side, left hand on the floor for balance, right hand at your right side. you should feel stiff like a plank. Then lift your right leg up toward the ceiling. Do this a lot then switch to your left. It looks like your legs are scissors when you do this|`|XGHLrOklaa	I would like to know that as well because I do the elliptical and weights for my legs specifically inner thigh work and I can't get rid of it for nothing.

If it's gross, hmm, maybe its ***. in which case, just try soapy warm water. I get a little excited sometimes and thats what works for me.|`|yXmgvaXpaa	You can get a hand held brush that you would use for washing a car (needs to be hard bristles on it), and get a can of Resolve carpet cleaner.  Really any carpet cleaner will do but I like the Resolve foaming cleaner the best.  Spray it on the dirty area and let the foam sink in a little bit, then take the brush and scrub the floor where it's dirty.  Let it dry (depends on how deep your carpet fibers are) and then vacuum it up.  If you still see the stain, do it again until it comes out.  You can rent one of the stain removers from Wal-Mart but the way I do it is cheaper and less of a pain to drag that thing in the house!  Hope it helps!
pmDSRqglaa	u can never know, everyone is different, except if u start getting little back pains, thats a signal|`|AXAyuFW8aa	I just got mine yesterday. I have been wearing pantiliner for the last 8 months because of heavy discharge. Then about 9 months later, I saw usual spotting of blood on it. And now, I have it. <br>  <br>  The normal starting point is at age 12 but, can be at a higher or lower age. It all depends on when your body is ready for it. It will start when it will, but I am guessing you will start in the next 4-10 months. <br>  <br>  It really isn't anything to look forward to though. I hope this helps!|`|mSFjbetxaa	Most girls start around the age of 12.|`|KGOxYkh7aa	well its supposed to be 2 years after youve had breast development and started growing pubic hair. start it according to that. i got mine seventh grade. you might too if you got a bra in 5th. discharge is a sign its coming soon but you could just have that for awhile.|`|jjoBO3jkaa	Every girl is different. the human body is not a machine.

69SHxWA9aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  First - get rid of your eczema, then second do what you want with your life.  Keep spraying the effected areas with some 2.5 PH water once a week, even after it is gone, and it will stay away.<br>  <br>  I have been helping a friend get rid of his psoriasis’ on his skin, it covers about 2 square feet of his arms and hands. <br>  <br>  He has been spraying on 2.5 PH water for about a month now, and it is working. He is also drinking 9.5 PH water. His wife has MS, and is also drinking the 9.5 PH alkaline water, and is doing much better.<br>  <br>  You can get free alkaline water - place a wanted add on <a href="http://craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">http://craigslist.com</a>  Ask for 8.5 PH drinking water.  Usually the same machine will make the 2.5 PH water too.<br>  <br>  Here is a demo video to watch for the eczema cure as seen in Japan. Sorry but the hospitals in the United States and Europe are not this advanced at this time.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLW-HKgQzU&feature=PlayList&p=262C30FDF046ADAB&playnext=1&index=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLW-HKgQ...</a><br>  <br>  Allergies  to food include shellfish, garlic, and others. Stop eating things like cheese, then milk products, then anything brewed (beer, yogurt, breads made with yeast). When it goes away, then you have some idea of what you should stop eating. <br>  <br>  Or use the process developed in Japan, and eat what you want to.<br>  <br>  Exposure to UV light can also help  many who have eczema.  Yes walking out in the sunshine, without UV protecting sunblock on will expose your skin condition to UV light.<br>  <br>  Good Luck !|`|DSl2b2pwaa	I wouldn't sacrifice a career choice over a treatable skin condition. What kind of creams have you tried? There are different levels of steroid creams that can be applied to your skin to help reduce eczema. You may consult a physician or a dermotologist concerning these creams. Also, after you wash your hands, you should apply lotion to your hands. If you wash your hands a lot or compulsively like I do, your skin can become irritated by the soaps.|`|211c888ebc2dc4af0e368207777268ddaa	I don't think you really have to worry if you are concerned enough to take care of YOURSELF first, lol. There are many great products for resolving and preventing eczema and they work much better than over the counter creams( there is a fabulous cream made with horse urine - gross i know - but it works great on your hands and they use it in hospitals a lot and lots of nurses use it). There is also anti-histamines and cortisone if it gets really bad. I find vitamin D & E (eating it, not cream) helps my eczema a lot. So go and get the professional help you need first and then you can go and become a professional! If you don't get the open wounds from the eczema you'll be fine.

RSBufJHUaa	YEARS ago: at the end of Atlantic Avenue in Virginia Beach in the front seat of my '68 VW Karman Ghia,  in the garage of a not finished house 2 doors down from my gf's house, at a party on a toilet and we broke the lid so the next day I bought a new seat and left it on their front porch, in a tent with my sister-in-law 'sleeping' next to us, in a motel with my mother-in-law 'sleeping' in the other bed, on top of a missile storage magazine at a weapons compound at a local naval air station where I was stationed, on my commander's couch and executive chair. Also on duty in the warehouse with my lady bent over our pool table, on our back porch, on my sis-in-law's back porch 7 miles outside of town, on a local beach in a secluded area and someone was watching us with a spy-glass only my lady didn't know, in the back seat of my car after we were married a few years at a drive-in theater with another couple up front having oral sex.  Behind a warehouse I was working in on a Saturday in the grass and we could see cars on the expressway, on a beach on the ocean side of the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and a C-141 was taking off while were were in the middle of making love.  I'm sure I could remember some other places, but that'll get ya started.

My cousins on the other hand hurt a few days after she got it pierced.     <br>  <br>  It won't get infected as long as your clean every day.  Clean it with the ear piercing cleaning stuff.  I know some places say to use soap, but I found that if I used soap it would make it irritated (Unless I was in the shower and used the ear piercing cleaning stuff too)<br>  <br>  And the lump near your ear is probably a pimple under the skin. ick. :P|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Body piercings are more trouble than they're worth.

IFGYXPDbaa	It'll relax you and loosen you up.<br>  <br>  Pro athletes use it before working out or before a game.  It gets them warmed up.<br>  <br>  During recovery, a lot of athletes will alternate between cold and hot.  This increases blood flow in an area, leading to faster recovery becasue the lactic acid is flushed out of the muscles.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't use heat if you are experiencing swelling.

AUOp1j5Saa	She can get an abortion up until the early second trimester; however, she should try to get one as soon as possibly because the later the abortion the higher the price.<br>  As for whether or not she must inform a parent, it depends on what state you life in. Some will need to inform the parents while others require direct consent. A few don't require the parents be informed or give consent.<br>  The cost will vary depending on how far along she is.<br>  The cheapest is will go is about $280-320 USD. The longer she waits, the more expensive it will be. A second trimester abortion can run anywhere from 1k to 5k so be sure to have the procedure performed as quickly as possible.<br>  <br>  There are two things they can do to perform an abortion, a medical or a surgical abortion.<br>  A medical abortion involves certain drugs which induce abortion very early on in a pregnancy. There is a chance this can fail; however, in which case a surgical abortion must be performed anyway.<br>  <br>  In the case of a surgical abortion, what they will do is essentially insert a sharp cutter-age into her vagina to destroy the fetus and then use a hose to suction the remains out.<br>  <br>  It is a simple out-patient process and is the most commonly performed surgical procedure in the US. <br>  There are usually no complications and usually almost no pain. What pain there is is very minor, no more than menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  She shouldn't have a recovery time; however, I still highly recommend she tell her mother even though I know that, to her, that's the last thing she wants to do.<br>  <br>  Still, it's your friend's body and it's her choice what happens to it. She needs to make decisions on her own based on her own actions and should not allow anyone else to influence her decision.<br>  Woman's choice.|`|aae33ca98ed4acc2878892601466ebc5aa	She really needs to tell her parents.

They offer confidential abortions, and it's possible that your friend can go without a parent at the age of 16 depending on what state you live in. I also believe most of them have programs where all fees can be waived so there's a chance she won't have to pay for the abortion, especially since she doesn't want her parents to know (so her insurance can't be billed). <br>  <br>  This is HER choice and HER decision.

So I know that despite all of her good intentions and reasons for this,  she will guaranteed regret it and feel depressed/sad, no ifs ands or buts about it (even if she doesn't now). The abortion will be extremely uncomfortable/painful/traumatic when they insert the special vacuum device into your uterus, even though they gave you drugs (nitrous oxide mask and relaxer pill). She will feel dizzy/drunk afterwards and want to throw up. You'll be there for at least 3 hours (most of the time just waiting for the procedure and the other just recovering), she cannot drive a vehicle afterwards. She will think about this baby for the rest of her life and it will haunt her. I'm not saying this as a scare tactic, I'm saying this because its the truth. I had my abortion last thursday and I am seriously messed up now because of it. I wish I could just turn back time to a month ago and avoid getting pregnant. I wish I could turn back time to last thursday and walk out of that clinic before they gave me the relaxer that numbs your mind.....the only thing that makes me feel better now is the fact that I have plans to volunteer my time to improve the lives of others and that I have just committed myself to sponsoring a child in a poor country so that I can at least give someone else a chance at life.|`|hARy7nsMaa	it depends on the state, but it probably won't require a parent/guardian to be there. it will cost somewhere between 250-600 dollars, and since she probably just got pregnant, she'll get a medical abortion which is a series of two pills, and her parents might notice her having the most painful period of her life for about 4-6 hours.|`|9v58zuHqaa	DONT DO IT GOD WILL PUNISH THE WICKED!<br>  <br>  Although, with the economy being bad and all, its definitely not a good time to be having a baby.<br>  <br>  My abortion experience  was pretty easy on me.

It doesn't cost as much figuring you'd be spending 1 MILLION dollars for a child by the time they graduate out of of college. Basically they sedate you, and you wake up feeling lighter... she'll recover physically in no time. Your friend is right though. She has a future.

When I found out I told my mom and she actually helped me a lot more than I though, we went to the pharmacy and asked where we could get information about hospitals in the area which would perform abortions, I think that you could also address your doctor. After I had made an appointment, I had to have a test to check if I was really pregnant (ultrasound). Then the doctor sent me to a psychologist and we talked about the options and other solutions, but I was a 100% sure that I wanted an abortion. Then a week after that I had to go see the psychologist again to make sure I didn't change my mind, then the day after they performed the abortion, I went in in the morning and was out by noon. It was like I had my period and that was it. I didn't have to pay a lot since we have a good health insurance here, and the rest my mother paid. If she trusts her mother, maybe she should tell her, or a close adult friend. Good luck with your friend, I hope everything works out for you.<br>  <br>  Oh by the way, don't wait to long! In Europe your can have it removed till 12 weeks! I don't know how long it is where you live!

wTvlreI7aa	Yes, it can be  spread from men to men,or women to women, or men to women. As long as there is unprotected sex involved and one person has AIDS, it's possible for the other person to get it aswell. You can also get the AIDS virus through a dirty needle, blood on blood contact, or if you somehow get an infected persons blood in your eye, or even on your skin. Kissing will not spread AIDS. You would have to swallow gallons of an infected persons saliva at once to get AIDS that way.

Lentiviruses are in turn part of a larger group of viruses known as retroviruses. The name 'lentivirus' literally means 'slow virus' because they take such a long time to produce any adverse effects in the body. They have been found in a number of different animals, including cats, sheep, horses and cattle. However, the most interesting lentivirus in terms of the investigation into the origins of HIV is the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) that affects monkeys.<br>  So did HIV come from an SIV?<br>  It is now thought that HIV came from a similar virus found in chimpanzees.<br>  <br>  It is now generally accepted that HIV is a descendant of a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus because certain strains of SIVs bear a very close resemblance to HIV-1 and HIV-2, the two types of HIV.<br>  <br>  HIV-2 for example corresponds to SIVsm, a strain of the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus found in the sooty mangabey (also known as the White-collared monkey), which is indigenous to western Africa.<br>  <br>  The more virulent, pandemic strain of HIV, namely HIV-1, was until recently more difficult to place. Until 1999, the closest counterpart that had been identified was SIVcpz, the SIV found in chimpanzees. However, this virus still had certain significant differences from HIV.<br>  What happened in 1999?<br>  <br>  In February 1999 a group of researchers from the University of Alabama1 announced that they had found a type of SIVcpz that was almost identical to HIV-1. This particular strain was identified in a frozen sample taken from a captive member of the sub-group of chimpanzees known as Pan troglodytes troglodytes (P. t. troglodytes), which were once common in west-central Africa.<br>  <br>  The researchers (led by Paul Sharp of Nottingham University and Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama) made the discovery during the course of a 10-year long study into the origins of the virus. They claimed that this sample proved that chimpanzees were the source of HIV-1, and that the virus had at some point crossed species from chimps to humans.<br>  <br>  Their final findings were published two years later in Nature magazine2. In this article, they concluded that wild chimps had been infected simultaneously with two different simian immunodeficiency viruses which had "viral sex" to form a third virus that could be passed on to other chimps and, more significantly, was capable of infecting humans and causing AIDS.<br>  <br>  These two different viruses were traced back to a SIV that infected red-capped mangabeys and one found in greater spot-nosed monkeys. They believe that the hybridisation took place inside chimps that had become infected with both strains of SIV after they hunted and killed the two smaller species of monkey.<br>  <br>  They also concluded that all three 'groups' of HIV-1 - namely Group M, N and O (see our strains and subtypes page for more information on these) - came from the SIV found in P. t. troglodytes, and that each group represented a separate crossover 'event' from chimps to humans.<br>  How could HIV have crossed species?<br>  <br>  It has been known for a long time that certain viruses can pass between species. Indeed, the very fact that chimpanzees obtained SIV from two other species of primate shows just how easily this crossover can occur. As animals ourselves, we are just as susceptible. When a viral transfer between animals and humans takes place, it is known as zoonosis.<br>  <br>  Below are some of the most common theories about how this 'zoonosis' took place, and how SIV became HIV in humans:<br>  The 'Hunter' Theory<br>  <br>  The most commonly accepted theory is that of the 'hunter'. In this scenario, SIVcpz was transferred to humans as a result of chimps being killed and eaten or their blood getting into cuts or wounds on the hunter. Normally the hunter's body would have fought off SIV, but on a few occasions it adapted itself within its new human host and become HIV-1. The fact that there were several different early strains of HIV, each with a slightly different genetic make-up (the most common of which was HIV-1 group M), would support this theory: every time it passed from a chimpanzee to a man, it would have developed in a slightly different way within his body, and thus produced a slightly different strain.<br>  <br>  An article published in The Lancet in 20043, also shows how retroviral transfer from primates to hunters is still occurring even today. In a sample of 1099 individuals in Cameroon , they discovered ten (1%) were infected with SFV (Simian Foamy Virus), an illness which, like SIV, was previously thought only to infect primates. All these infections were believed to have been acquired through the butchering and consumption of monkey and ape meat. Discoveries such as this have led to calls for an outright ban on bushmeat hunting to prevent simian viruses being passed to humans.|`|wtzCUZ3eaa	The first known AIDS cases were found in gay men.

It's not pleasant having someone poke a needle through your skin, but it is important to remember that it is not actually harmful.   It also does not hurt nearly as much as people expect it to hurt.    <br>  <br>  In my case, I was afraid of getting shots when I was a little kid.  I had a doctor who was very wise about this.  I was crying once, and he asked if I was scared.  I told him I was.  He asked me if I wanted to give the shot to myself.  Of course I shook my head "NO!".   I also told him I don't know how to do it.   <br>  <br>  Then he asked if we could do it together.  I asked what he meant.  He said that since he knew how to put it in,  he could do that part.  He said I could tell him when to pull it out.  That seemed reasonable to me.  I was only about five years old,  but I remember thinking that it was far more important to be able to decide when to pull the needle out.  <br>  <br>  I agreed to this deal,  and barely even cried any more.   I actually thanked him for doing it that way.  It still hurt some,  but not as much with me getting to say "OK PULL IT OUT NOW."   It never occurred to me that he was planning to pull it out pretty quickly anyway.  <br>  <br>  I'm a lot older than 5 now.   I only hate shots if I can not see what the person is doing.  Lots of people are nervous about injections.   I make my dentist position a mirror so I can watch what she is doing,  and I always watch when I get a blood test.  I know other people who do the same basic thing.  Some people are just the opposite - they don't want to see anything.<br>  <br>  Tell the person flat out that you are scared.  Lots of people are.  If the person mocks you, leave - no matter how old you are.  Find another clinic,  or at least a better employee who is more thoughtful.  Decide whether you want to watch.  The person drawing your blood can place a little piece of gauze or cotton pad over the needle while she draws the blood.  Don't let her do that if you want to watch.  I always tell her to make sure I can see what she is doing.  The needle will probably be in your body for less than 15 seconds.<br>  <br>  If you are really frightened,  tell the person taking your blood that you want to be able to tell her when to pull the needle out if you just can't take it any longer.  Ask her how long it will take.  You will be more relaxed if you take five or six very slow deep breaths just before she draws your blood.   Try that.<br>  <br>  If you are not an adult,  don't let your Mom or Dad be there,  unless you want them in the room.  You might be more scared if they are watching,  and you might be more embarrassed if you are an older kid and cry in front of your parents.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  I think it will be easier than you expect.  You will probably be surprised at how quickly it all is over.   It hurts less than a bee sting when the needle goes in,  and after it is out you will feel very little or no pain at all from the spot where the blood was drawn.<br>  <br>  Be honest with the technician.  If it's your very first time,  ask her to explain what she's going to do, and ask how long it will take.|`|51Ib0kxVaa	my best advice is not to look - at any of it or at your arm when they do it.

ZDrXFS2daa	Simple! You insert your penis into the female vagina and ejaculate. It is possible for her to be pregnant. But there are all kinds of variables that depend on whether it actually results in a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Popped her cherry means you have penetrated her hymen and she is no longer a virgin. In this phrase the "cherry" is the hymen. The hymen is a thin layer of sort of skin in the female vagina. It must be penetrated to "pop" it.<br>  <br>  The labia is a fold of skin on the outside of the female vagina. It can sometimes emit a substance to lubricate the passageway to the vagina. <br>  <br>  Is that simple enough? If not, contact me directly by e-mail.

If you're not there yet, it should be ok as long as you don't over do it. Males who haven't reached the puberty stage can do some damage if they try to do too much too soon. Once you start, start slow. Best is low weights and high reps if you just want to get stronger.Lift slowly, not fast.<br>  EDIT; be very careful about that web site above. Body building hasn't been around "for centuries" in the US ! That's non-sense ! I think it probably started in the 1950's...|`|GuUQmMceaa	Like another use has said, lifting weights WILL stunt your growth because it will disrupt the growth patterns your body has.  Now, exercising and staying in good shape shouldn't hurt you.  Being active in sports and what not can keep your body defined and in the long run, make it easier for you to lift weights as you get older.  But no, do not lift weights at a 14 because it could cause spinal malfunction when you get older, joint problems, and may other problems because it cause your body to focus more on growing the muscles and what not, back jamming the bone development and growth.  It's kinda like the same thing as smoking at 14 (as most kids seem to think is cool these days........), it will more than likely stunt your growth and destroy your body faster as you get older.  <br>  Because when you destroy those growing genes and traits that your body is slowly developing, you can't gain them back. <br>  <br>  Just wait till your growing is done, which is usually around 18-19, maybe a little earlier, but be careful if you decide to.  :)|`|qaMLTBJ3aa	It is a good idea to get in shape but it will come with a price. What you want to do is use light weights to tone your muscles. Because of your age, using heavy weights to build mass can possible stunt some of your bone growth. Just be car full.|`|n2LrFlxIaa	Er..

Cb0bdPdxaa	Hi, no you're not insomniac. You need to pick a time to go to bed and stick to it. Do not drink soda or eat candy before going to bed. Also, try not to watch TV right before going to bed. Try reading something interesting. If you cannot fall asleep, stay in bed until you go to sleep. If you wake up early and cant go back to sleep, go to school and do what you do everyday. DO NOT TAKE NAPS. I guarantee you, at night, when its time to go to bed, you will be very tired and will fall asleep right away. Trust me.|`|KASMkR5Maa	ok try tynol pm its safe and helped me i took it everday for a month now my sleeping habits are good it will help ur body get use to a sleep cycle|`|4GYCaoP6aa	Insomnia is really common for teenagers too, since they are under a lot of stress. I had the same problem...  I felt almost as though I'd forgotten how to sleep at all, and I couldn't stop thinking about school, or what my plans were for the next day...  It was so frustrating.<br>  <br>  The only thing I found that helped when I absolutely could not sleep were OTC sleep aids, like Unisom, or Benedryl (even though benedryl is technically sold as an allergy medication, it is the same thing as Unisom, and I actually prefer it, because is comes in smaller doses)<br>  <br>  But if you take sleep aids, only use them when you really can't fall asleep on your own.<br>  Also, thinking about relaxing things, and taking slow deep breaths are you're trying to fall asleep really helps a lot...|`|IyvUC47Paa	exercise more often before you fall asleep. this will make your body  tired and get some rest.<br>  <br>  or just go to a crooked doctor and he'll give you a very special prescription ;)|`|G1T0dCjaaa	try drinking warm milk or horlicks before bed as it calms your mind and helps you drift off. also try meditation. if you are concerned about possibly having insomnia go to your local doctor and speak to them about it. even if it turns out your not they will tell you things you could try or medicine or even herbal remedies.
e105cfb2a3df44e1d4835131ebd93824aa	I would say its because you are dry, i somtimes have this and its really uncomfortable. Use some KY jelly just on the tip or some Vitamain E oil.

If you have too much bacteria you get an infestation, but if you don't have enough bacteria you get a fungal infestation.<br>  <br>  When a woman gets a yeast infection (be it do to anti bacterial soaps, douching, or poor diet) it means that she has a low amount of bacteria. It is advised that they EAT yogurt, not smear it on their vagina. Also, if they have a yeast infection, they need to not take bubble baths, douche, or use anti bacterial soaps when showering.<br>  <br>  If they get a bacterial infection from having TOO much bacteria, then they have to take medication.<br>  <br>  In either case, spearing yogurt will most likely cause MORE harm (cause a bacterial infection) then good. If you need more information, just email me.|`|w0ZDe89Laa	this is a friend of a friend thing...my friend had a yeast infection and she asked what she should try.

You need test results before you panic.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Standard procedure for condition. <br>  Do it, then after worry is need be.|`|AA11570675	As we're formed in the womb, initially the heart isn't complete but there is a hole between 2 of the chambers. This usually closes before birth. Some babies are born with this incomplete, either a hole in the heart or the initially closure is only just formed, which creates the murmur. Children survive even with a hole, though in such an event usually an operation is necessary to close it as an opening will have implications for health. A murmur should have little or no implication beyond the fact that it makes a noise. Some can even right themselves as the child grows.<br>  The point of the scan is to check that there is a proper closure with no leakage. Both sound pretty similar even to a specialist so the echo check is a way of making sure that what sounds like a murmur is no more than just a noise.|`|s8TwWPdDaa	No need to worry at all!

P544Sbmqaa	You cant sue because you have nothing to sue over.  SSI is based on your income, and inheritance counts as income.  It put you over the income limit, so you were no longer eligible.<br>  <br>  Maybe you need to find a hospital that will work with you on payments or adjust your payment by income.<br>  <br>  As far as medical help though, ssdi isnt going to pay for that.

Also drink only water with meals, and try to exercise at least half an hour a day- aerobic exercise, not weights. You can also add one or two days of weight training because muscle burns more fat. <br>  <br>  There are 3,500 calories to every pound. This means you must get rid of 35,000 calories by prom in order to lose 10 pounds. Do this by either diet or exercise.<br>  <br>  Make sure to drink A LOT of water to minimize bloating and water retention. When you don't drink enough water, your body holds on to it, making you bloat, in the same way if you starve yourself your body stores fat in order to protect itself.

They come with a rechargeable battery, when you inhale, you get a burst of nicotine for that craving and it actually looks like you're blowing out smoke but it's a water vapor mist.  The tip of the cigarette even illuminates.  So you get the nicotine you crave, the hand and mouth fixation is covered and exhaling the vapor mist looks like smoke.  <br>  <br>  The beauty of it is you still get all the stuff you crave from smoking without all the negative side effects or harmful additives found in tobacco.  The starter kit comes with the electronic cigarette, battery, and five nicotine cartridges.  Each cartridge is supposed to be equal to 1-2 packs of cigarettes.  The kit is $79 and the cartridge refills are around $13 for a pack of five.  I will be ordering from the site below.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dog1vQNBaa	23 is still not that late. Body can recover if you quit at this age also and will be able to lead a healthy life again. If you want any suggestion on quitting i will tell you my friend's case who was addicted for 8-10years. When he decided to quit he opted for substitute as Nicotine gum. they helped him a lot in quit smoking. Best part of it was that he got the free sample of 100 pcs to try first. you can also go for a free sample and try if they help you too. check them at
VdBZjRo5aa	you may have dry socket. i had that after i got a tooth pulled and i was in so much pain. it was worse than the pain i had from the cavity. so that could be it and theres not much they can do for that. you gotta just wait it out. i feel for you. i have had a toothache since friday so i know how you feel. you can def take painkillers with antibiotics. the ER doc gave me both at the same time so im assuming its safe. good luck. i hope the pain subsides soon.|`|5jf5tcMnaa	Absolutely.  Take the painkillers the dentist prescribed for you.<br>  Following an extraction, I usually have my patients take a combination of Ibuprofen and Acetominophen.<br>  Something like 1-2 Tylenol 3 or Tylenol Extra Strength at Noon, then 600mg Ibuprofen at around 3pm.  Then Tylenol 3 again around  4-6pm...and so on and so on.<br>  Take the least you need to make you comfortable, and stop as soon as you can.|`|t7wWebJVaa	You most likely have a dry socket.<br>  After extraction if there is insufficient beeding to provide an adequate blood clot in the socket a dry socket occurs.<br>  This is more usual in smokers and in bottom teeth.<br>  Yes you can take painkillers with your antibiotic.<br>  However adhere strictly to the correct dose of painkillers.<br>  The amoxy antibiotic is a penecillin used to treat bacterial infections .You may have had abscess,infection in that tooth.<br>  Finish prescribed dose antibiotics unless told otherwise by your dentist.<br>  You can go back to him/her and have the dry socket cleaned which will relieve pain.<br>  Dry sockets 'heal' in 4-5days to a week|`|zmBSnT6iaa	i don't know

Clean it good and use some antibiotic ointment and keep a close eye on it as you could develop a staph infection.|`|kvrYJ9eYaa	That sounds quite worrying. The most common cause for pimples forming is because the Sebaceous follicle glands create oil and this clogs up the pores. I found that out on some site. Maybe you could find a way to reduce to pores clogging up so it doesn't happen again.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	if it's a pimple leave it but if it's some thing ells treat it with alcohol and maybe take some advil or something just in case.|`|sGnmbCxtaa	leave it...<br>  leave it like you do with the pimples on your face..<br>  it will go away

PwHWJkcYaa	No you're not safe. Antibiotics stop microgynon from working. I've been taking it for 3 years and never been protected by it because I'm always on antibiotics, it's more pain relief for me. Get the morning after pill and use condoms. Be safe. And remember, it takes a month for microgynon to become effective after any disruptions to the cycle (including: the runs, antibiotics and throwing up), so use a condom for the month after you finish the course of antibitotics, at least!|`|laVGEEeraa	You might be but then again...

It is a tell-tale sign if you have.|`|wPT33kEUaa	i know there meant to reduce the effectiveness of the pill buh iv done it before and not fallen pregnant, its hard to say really your best bet is waite a while and take a test. best of luck x|`|vpXbMSGnaa	you should still be safe, :)|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Antibiotics interfere with the pill.

G1T0dCjaaa	as you mentioned your brother is a very caring person, which says to me straight away that he is more used to looking after people than people looking after him. if he's lived his life looking after people he will always play down any illness he may get, because if he's ill he can't look after others as well.<br>  <br>  the best thing i can suggest is to look up his symptoms on the NHS website and see if you can diagnose his problem yourself. when you think you've got it build your case and then present it to him so that he can't turn from it. if that doesn't work get his friends to keep on at him. the more people that keep on the more likely he'll go to the doctors just to 'shut you all up'.<br>  <br>  good luck with him and i hope it is nothing serious|`|Cb0bdPdxaa	Since you said he's a little stubborn, maybe he doesn't want anyone to tell him what to do. I think he's the type of people that likes doing things his own way and if someone says otherwise, he shuts down or denies things. If tis is the case, the best thing to do is to show show him that he needs to pay attention to his condition. Explain his symptoms and try to help him the best you can.|`|jvJqmliBaa	He may not want anybody to feel sorry for him or think he is less of a man for having an illness/weakness..Just keep trying to get through to him by sitting him down to talk or if that doesnt work..bring some family members into it to help you. hope everything turns out ok

517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	You didn't say when the test is or what your fitness level is.<br>  <br>  Depending on your current fitness level, do anything cardio at an intensity level that causes you to breathe harder (You should NOT be gasping or in pain!), and do it for about 30 minutes daily until your test. If you're in poor shape, this may mean walking. If you're in moderate shape, this may mean walk/jogging or jog/running, etc. Also, instead of driving or taking elevators, find opportunities to walk and to take stairs.<br>  <br>  It takes a few weeks for your body to adapt to a higher fitness level, so be patient. <br>  <br>  A fitness test is just to assess your ability. Your fitness level is whatever it is. Whatever you do, don't over do it or you'll injure yourself!
qpmGLd7laa	Read the labels!  20 pills is most likely way too much; never take more than it says to take, and if these pills have the same things in them, you are going to seriously over-do some things.  You need to get more nutrients from the food you eat than the pills you take.  If you take 3 pills that each give you, say, 100% of your daily allowance of niacin, for example, you are going to have a total of 300% your daily allowance, which can mess up your nervous system.  You can do more damage than just liver damage by doing what you're doing.  Be careful, and talk to a doctor or dietitian about what you should be taking.|`|211c888ebc2dc4af0e368207777268ddaa	You should worry. When the pills are separate, they just add more filler, so in most cases you are likely wasting your money. If you want to add to the amounts over and above a multivitamin, then add the food you need to do it or buy something like "greens" or dandelions. Water soluble vitamins will not likely damage your liver and kidneys, but if you are taking too much it can stress your system. Fat Soluble vitamins you can over do and do PERMANENT damaged to these systems. Good luck and good health! When vitamins are taken in their natural form (ie food), then it is almost impossible to over do it, as there is usually something else in the food to counter-balance it. Good luck and good health!

ifIRySXpaa	You'll most likely get three answers to that question: "diarrea", "too much of anything isn't good", and "fruits are very high in sugar".<br>  <br>  Fruits are delicious, nutritious and definitely better than eating candies, cookies, chips or chocolate. Fruits are low in calories and fats, have a variety of nutrients and lots of water, and are generally high in carbohydrates and sugars, but it's not like those things are enemies to the body... they're all needed for the body to function properly. But you'll hear all kinds of different things (and how do you know if you can trust them) so in the end, it really comes down to how your body reacts to eating lots of fruit. And make sure that they're not sweetened (why oh why do people sweeten fruits?) There shouldn't be any other ingredients in fruits unless you count the dozens of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides used... To fix that problem, the best thing to do is buy organic and local fruits, or grow your own garden with them. If you do so, make sure the seeds are organic as well. Just don't drink fruit juices; By processing them through a juicer, they lose nutrients and fiber, which can lead to insulin spikes. You need that fiber in there! If you make fruit smoothies, add 1-2 tablespoons of ground flax seed, it'll give you extra fiber and lots of excellent nutrients. Just remember, if you consume lots of fiber, make sure to drink lots of water. Do research on the fruits that you eat most of the time. One website that's loaded with interesting information is <a href="http://whfoods.org." rel="nofollow">http://whfoods.org.</a> You'll also learn lots about fruits if you look up the term "fruitarian" there are lots of websites on this topic that completely ignore any negative effects there might be, but there's also some scientific-type research that looks at the pro and cons and how it affects peoples bodies.<br>  <br>  I love fruit.

9czyg6RYaa	Well obviously her boyfriend is probably bringing the food into the house so just let her know more about the situation. She might not be aware of what's happening.

Ice will help this, and it should take between 3 to 5 days.  and then asses whether or not you can bend your knee fully.  it will be stiff at first which is fine but after a few more days as long as nothing locks up or gives a dislocating feeling then you are fine.<br>  <br>  don't baby your knee because it will get weak but just be careful you don't hurt or twist it.|`|a3bq277Gaa	If you're that worried, get a second opinion from another doctor.|`|nGwaz9z5aa	A knee brace will lessen your risk of furthur injuring your knee.

xaW4APjbaa	Can lymphocytes become cancerous? Hmm, good question. I would say YES, but not in a way that will cause tumors. White blood cells devide differently from other cells in the body, and even though something is wrong with it, it doesn't stay in one spot to create a tumor. However, it is possible that these cancerous white blood cells could then induce nearby tissues to become cancerous. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind however, that white blood cells do not have the same regulatory "check marks" as other cells do. and they are already in a state of rapid revision anyways. Hence, when you have an immune response, it happens so quick. Your immune system releases hormons that causes the cells to rapidly divide.<br>  <br>  Would be a very cool experiment.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  White blood cells divide fairly rapidly, I say try it out and see what happens!|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Dale is correct. Immune cells (white blood cells) can develop into Leukemia and other cancerous diseases, however, they will not form a tumor because they travel through your blood stream.

Dizziness may result from a disorder that affects any of the many body parts involved in balance (such as the inner ear and eyes) or from certain drugs.<br>  ? The person's description of the problem and the results of a physical examination may suggest a cause, which may lead to additional tests.<br>  ? Treatment depends on the cause and may include treatment to relieve accompanying symptoms.<br>  <br>  Dizziness accounts for about 5 to 6% of visits to the doctor. It may occur at any age but becomes more common as people age. It affects about 40% of people older than 40 at some time. At any age, dizziness can cause problems, particularly when doing an exacting or a dangerous task, such as driving or operating heavy machinery. People who have dizziness that persists or interferes with daily activities should see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Doctors usually classify dizziness as:<br>  ? Faintness or light-headedness<br>  ? Loss of balance<br>  ? Vertigo<br>  ? A mixture of these types<br>  ? None of these types<br>  <br>  Dizziness may be temporary or chronic. Dizziness is considered chronic if it lasts more than a month. Chronic dizziness is more common among older people. Chronic dizziness is often difficult to classify because it often involves more than one cause and because it seems different at different times—for example, like light-headedness one time and like vertigo the next.<br>  <br>  Causes<br>  Although dizziness may be disturbing and even incapacitating, only about 5% of cases result from a serious disorder. Dizziness has many causes because many body parts work together to maintain balance. They include the inner ear, the eyes (which provide visual cues needed to maintain balance), muscles and joints, the brain (mainly the brain stem and cerebellum), and the nerves that connect all of the parts.<br>  <br>  Each type of dizziness tends to have characteristic causes. For example, faintness and light-headedness may result from a sudden fall in blood pressure or from other disorders that result in an inadequate blood supply to the brain. In these disorders, the heart may be unable to pump enough to the brain, or the arteries to the brain may be blocked or narrowed.<br>  <br>  Loss of balance may result from vision disturbances because the body depends on visual cues to maintain balance. Loss of balance may also result from musculoskeletal disorders, which cause muscle weakness and thus interfere with walking. Other causes include use of certain drugs (such as anticonvulsants and sedatives) and disorders of the inner ear.<br>   <br>  Diagnosis<br>  Before dizziness can be treated, doctors must determine its nature and its cause. Doctors ask the person to describe in detail the sensations felt: whether the feeling during the episode was faintness, light-headedness, loss of balance, spinning or movement of self or the surroundings (vertigo), or another sensation. The person is asked when the dizziness began, how long it lasted, what triggered or relieved it, and what other symptoms—headaches, deafness, noise in the ears (tinnitus), impaired vision, weakness, or difficulty walking—were present. Such details help pinpoint the nature of the dizziness and may suggest a cause.<br>  <br>  One of a doctor's chief aims when performing the physical examination is to reproduce (provoke) the symptoms. A drop in blood pressure on standing up (orthostatic hypotension) is one of the most common causes of dizziness. Therefore, doctors try to provoke the fall in blood pressure by changing the person's position and seeing whether the symptoms develop when the blood pressure changes. Doctors measure blood pressure and pulse after the person has been lying down for 5 to 10 minutes, then after sitting, and again after standing up. Changes in blood pressure may be caused by dehydration, so doctors look for signs of dehydration and order laboratory tests.<br>  <br>  The person may be asked to breathe out vigorously against a closed mouth as if straining at stool. Such a manoeuvre temporarily slows the heart rate, which may reproduce the dizziness. Electrocardiography (ECG), heart rhythm monitoring for abnormalities, echocardiography, and exercise stress testing may also be done to evaluate heart function.<br>  <br>  When other diagnostic possibilities appear unlikely or no obvious cause of dizziness is found, the doctor may inquire about a possible psychological cause. Several tests can help doctors identify depression, and other psychological problems that may predispose the person to giddiness or a feeling of disassociation from the world. If no cause is identified, doctors re-examine the person periodically.<br>  <br>  Treatment<br>  Specific treatment depends on the cause identified. If the cause of dizziness is a drug, the drug is stopped or the dose reduced. Regardless of whether a cause is identified, drugs may be given to relieve accompanying symptoms (such as nausea) or to prevent blood pressure from falling.<br>  <br>  Spotlight on Aging<br>  As people age, some of the body parts involved in balance function less well|`|o1diDRccaa	that happens to me too.

My jaw keeps pooping/clicking and when I wake up in the morning, it feels really stiff  as if I have to pop it back in place. At one point, I wore a mouthguard (called a splint) to sleep at night, and that only made it worse! I just deal with it, but it never goes away. I am now 20 years old and still have it. The Doc told me that its incurable and that I should hold warm towels to my face and slowly open and close my mouth to relax the muscles. Its a pain in the ***, but I guess I gotta live with it.
Z8qBgv8taa	If the weed is crappy weigh it and say 3-4 percent of its weight is THC, for middies (ok weed, do 7-10 percent weight, and for skunk, or kush (high grade) take from 15-25 percent weight in THC<br>  Currently, 50 nanograms of THC metabolites per millimeter of urine defines a "presumptive positive" by NIDA certified labs. These cutoffs are not mandated for all testing facilities. The lab your sample is sent to may use a cutoff level of anywhere from 50Ng/ml to 15Ng/ml for confirmation testing, The fact is, methodology, accuracy and cutoff levels vary from lab to lab. This makes it extremely difficult to take appropriate counter-measures.
iEVEfPaVaa	It could be a little hard to get off but try rubbing alcohol.  If that doesn't work try washing that area with a good laundry stain reliever or carpet spot treament.  That should at least make it less obvious while it slowly fades.  You could try a jewelry cleaner also.  Or wear a ring over the stain until it's gone.  :)|`|KwHniD8baa	google it

wqchA8B7aa	If you want a larger posterior, then you need to exercise and build up the muscle - not eat more and gain fat.|`|8rMgQv15aa	In order to target your weight gain you need to exercise the muscles that you want to get bigger. Unfortunately you cant just eat and hope the weight goes to the right place. (that would be nice though, haha) the best exercises for your butt would be squats and lunges. <br>  <br>  If you want to see good results fast you should hit the gym at least 3 times a week to do these exercises. Here is my suggestion for best results:<br>  <br>  Start out with a warm up jog for about 15 minutes to get your blood flowing (or if you want to lose the chub you put on your belly you should run for a good 20 minutes at a good pace) and your heart pumping. Then before each exercise make sure you do a warm up set of each exercise with about 50% of the weight you would normally do for a workout. Do about 12 to 15 repetitions with half the weight. DON'T FORGET TO STRETCH! You don't want to pull anything.<br>  <br>  After you get your warm up reps in, here is my suggested routine for each workout:<br>  <br>  Do 3 sets with 10 reps the first set, then add some weight and do 6 reps, then add a little more weight and do 4 reps, or just keep going until you can't do anymore repetitions for the last set.<br>  <br>  Repeat that routine for each exercise. For lunges you can hold a pair of dumbbells in your hands for added resistance. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me a message!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! Good Luck!
zzaScg0haa	Net carbs|`|aEcDmwkeaa	im thinking the same ! because the atkins bars i brought seem to be counting, carbs of which r sugars, not total carbs, but since i been tucking into diabetic choc or no sugar products i seem to have slowed my weight loss ? so im confused too ! hope sumone answers !
aTBs7pJ4aa	u can eat protein bars anytime u want...<br>  but also... u should be taking whey protein shakes<br>  <br>  u need one gram of protein for each pound u weigh...<br>  and u should not be lifting weights longer then 40 - 60 mins.. after that its not neccesary.. unless u want to do some cardio after..<br>  <br>  u need to have sufficent protein and carbs in your stomach 2 hours before u workout to have energy.. so to answer yoru question u need protein all throught the day.... and especially after workouts
1d4Vin3Waa	Sounds like a Bursitis reaction or some initial arthritic problems depending on your age. The Patela (knee cap) is meant to ride over the knee joint prominences like a fingertip would ride between the knuckles on the opposing hand; because human knees don't align vertically with the hip splay, upper and lower leg angles there is a tendency for the patela to ride up onto the high points in the joint and cause inflammation of the tendons,bursa and the other areas. An NSAID like Tylenol or Aleve will provide short term relief, but you may need to do some specific physical therapy to re-align and strengthen the patelar ligaments to keep the kneecap from floating out of its normal channel of motion. There are basically sitting and flexing the Quadriceps group by straightening the lower leg and tensing the quads for 20 or so a few times three or four times a day. This will strengthen the muscles involved with locating the patela properly. After multiple knee surgeries for torn cartilage I've  had to do these exercises a long time. <br>  A second cause is Osgood-Slaughters syndrome <a href="http://life.familyeducation.com/illness/medical-treatment/42288.html" rel="nofollow">http://life.familyeducation.com/illness/...</a><br>  <br>  Since you didn't state an age, these would be the first two things I would look at.
jjUcYwG3aa	Sound like it, but if i were you i would go and see a doctor about this!
dDas43FZaa	Your muscles need time off to repair and grow. 5 days a week is better.|`|Dvawm8Ezaa	Go to the gym 5 days a week with two days in between to relax your muscles. Try to work it up to an hour to an hour and a half.|`|0f6mGogcaa	You should try go to to the gym 6 days a week and do 4-5 days of intense cardio (keep your heart rate up for at least 45 minutes).  You should also do weight training for at least 30 mins.  Make sure to rest for 48 hours before working out the same body part.  So if you do an upper body workout on Monday, you should not do another one until Wednesday.  It's best to do Arms, Back/Shoulders, Chest, Abs, Legs, that way you will be able to take two days off and work on another body party those two days.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ex..<br>  Monday: 45 Min Cardio /  30 Min Arms<br>  Tuesday: 45 Min Cardio / 30 Min Back/Shoulders<br>  Wednesday: 30 Min Chest<br>  Thursday: 45 Min Cardio / 30 Min Abs<br>  Friday: 45 Min Cardio / 30 Min Legs<br>  Saturday: REST (Go for a nice brisk walk)<br>  Sunday: 45 Minutes Cardio
dI9BLGYpaa	Your body will be in ketosis as soon as it starts using your fat for energy. You're in ketosis even when not on a low-carb diet, btw. I know because I used to be anorexic and they would test my urine for ketones every time I went to the clinic.<br>  <br>  I'm low-carbing now. I actually didn't start seeing the negative side-effects aka the "induction flu" until the 2nd week in. But I did loose like 7 or 8 pounds the 1st week. That's typical because carbs turn into glycogen, which is stored in muscle with up to 5 pounds of water. This major water weight loss is the 1st sign that you're on the right track.<br>  <br>  Very obese patients tend to do the best with Atkins because it's good at restoring insulin-sensitivity. Often what will happen for insulin-resistant patients is they will be put on an Atkins-type diet for about a month and do very well with it until insulin-sensitivity is restored. Then they seem to do a lot better on a low-fat, balanced diet.<br>  <br>  It's not an easy diet, though. You have to calculate the net carbs in everything--even black pepper has 3 net carbs per tablespoon, and garlic powder has 5! Who knew, right? And also cardio and strength training w/ a good source of protein directly afterward to build/protect muscle. I usually drink Dymatize Elite protein shake or a glass of soy milk.<br>  <br>  However, most people who go on Atkins don't do it right and end up losing weight just from the inevitable caloric restriction. Believe it or not, one of the biggest reasons why this diet is so criticized is that it kills hunger.|`|kLb8oF0Caa	I've used every diet known to man but nothing worked as well as acai berry.  I understand they say that pills don't work, nevertheless they sure worked for me, and they have been featured on CBS News too.

oojO4WAraa	Maybe you have a problem with allergies.  I used to have horrible allergies and it would weaken my lungs from the constant irritation, then I would get pneumonia - sometimes twice or three times in a year.  <br>  <br>  Since you are at the beginning of a cold you might try drinking 16 oz of water every hour and taking a 500 mg vitamin C with that water every hour.  This has helped me get over colds before they start.  The extra fluids will help wash the germs out of your lungs.  <br>  <br>  Also, talk to the doctor about an allergy test.  I assume you have had lung x-rays and have been assured there is nothing there to worry about, right?|`|yJCdLNHwaa	There a quite a few things with flu-like pneumonia-like symptoms.<br>  My suggestion: see a doctor and tell them what you are experiencing. If you listen to the wrong person on here it could have very bad consequences.|`|L5nNLnyGaa	Hello: my ex-husband used to get pneumonia at least twice a year.  He had mild asthma, but that turned out not to be the problem.  They discovered large polyps in his sinuses and nasal passages, which would get infected every time he got a cold, and then drip the bacteria down into his lungs.  They prescribed him a steroid nasal spray to help shrink the polyps, and it worked great.  He would occasionally still get pneumonia but only about every 3 years or so.  Eventually he needed surgery, but only after 20 years.  I suggest you see an ENT.|`|75MFPsEIaa	Anyone who has had pneumonia once is more prone to get it again.  Sounds like you also have a very low immune system.  There is a pneumonia shot you can get.  I believe it's once every 5 years.  You should also get a flu shot every year as well if you've had pneumonia before.  My daughter who is almost 9, had it twice, since starting school.  <br>  <br>  I would consult your doctor, but maybe you should also start taking really good care of yourself.  Take a multivitamin and drink at least 8, 8 ounce glasses of water per day.  Make sure you eat a balances diet rich in dark leafy green vegetables, and low fat protein.  Stop touching your face, and wash your hands frequently, especially before eating.  Good luck in feeling well.

KdFXk0ajaa	There are many factors involved in determining whether or not you are eligible for Social Security Disability (SSDI) benefits. If you have documentation of treatment for migraine headaches that are frequent and severe enough to preclude you from remaining gainfully employed. It is a long drawn out process. If you are not prescribed medication and have not been hospitalized on several occasions because of the migraines it will be unlikely. I have provided a link to the Social Security Administration (SSA) that provides you with the necessary forms and instructions on how to file for disability. I have provided you with a link to the U.S. Senate homepage. If you want to apply for SSDI benefits I would contact the senior U.S. Senator from your state. Each Senator/Representatives Office has staff that works in conjunction with SSA to ensure you receive a fair evaluation of your condition to see if it meets the SSDI standards. It helps if you have medical documentation with a diagnosis of migraine headaches. It must substantially interfere with your ability to hold a job. Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  UPDATE- Peaches is correct about a couple of things. You WILL be denied initially. According to a SSA representative they deny 98% of initial claims. I linked you to the U.S. Senate as that is the best route to take for your appeal. Those lawyers that advertise on TV if they manage to win take 25% of your retroactive money. I was fortunate enough to have the late, great, U.S. Senator John Chafee, (R-RI) to intercede on my behalf. He was also formerly the Governor of RI and Secretary of the Navy. His office inquired on my behalf and within 3 weeks I had a letter from SSA Regonal Director telling me the good news about my appeal. It is a long haul. Documentation of the disabling nature of your migraines is a necessity. Have you ever had a headache workup done? You will be required to see a doctor (most likely a neurologist) in your area who will examine you on their behalf looking for specific things. The link to SSA website will explain how they determine your payment amount if you are found to be disabled.|`|nAp688tZaa	It depends.  If you apply for Social Security Disability, you have to have a doctor state that there is no way that you are medically capable of performing any type of work or maintaining any position within a company.  Most people get turned down for SSD the first and second time that they apply.  Most have to go in front of an Administrative Law judge to have their case heard before they get approved.  It is a very long process and requires a lot of documentation from all your doctors.  You also have to be actively seeking medical treatment for the problem.  You should also be ready to see one of their doctors about the diagnosis, as this is standard practice for most disability cases.  Migraines are not typically a medical condition that is approved for disability, but if you have medical records showing all the treatment options you have pursued in the last 2 years, it may help.  You should also try and find a neurologist that is a migraine specialist.  Your normal doctors may have overlooked something important and you may not be getting the appropriate treatments for the condition.  Basically, getting disability is very tedious and difficult.  Most people get so fed up with the process that they stop trying, which is probably the goal of the government when it comes to these things.  They don't want to pay disability, so they make it is painful as they can to get you to give up, even though you have been paying taxes your entire working life for these benefits.|`|AA12349214	No.<br>  Find the reason for the migraines - and doctors dont always know.<br>  It could even be a lower back problem believe it or not.<br>  But no, benefits you are not entitled to.<br>  Go to a holistic person and see what they can do to help you.<br>  Life is too precious and too short to spend it with this affliction.<br>  If you go to empathaia - something like that - it is a dowsing website and has people on there who have a health practice dealing with all health problems - they will at least be able to pinpoint where the problem is.  Failure to find it there go to british society of dowsers and ask for someone from their professional health register.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	I don't know if migraines are considered to be a disabling condition.  Also, in order to get disability you have to be out of work, you can not be working when you apply and can not work while they are approving you which takes about 5 years.  In addition, you have to have worked for 10 years or you are not eligible for disability.  <br>  <br>  Getting disability isn't as easy as people think, the Social Security Administration doesn't just send out checks to people you have to have documented medical evidence that you are disabled.  <br>  <br>  You should look into disability insurance through your employer, I don't know if they offer it or not, but they need to, all employers need to offer disability insurance.  <br>  <br>  If you want to find out if migraines are a disabling condition you can call Social Security and ask them, or look it up online.  You would be looking for Appendix F to the Railroad and Retirement Act.<br>  <br>  Social Securities number is 1-800-772-1213|`|rao4C9Yxaa	nope

wocyfQ2Xaa	As a medical major I will tell you that recent studies show that eating habits will vary among kids with disabilities. A study proved that autistic children are more likely to eat less due to there mindsets. Autistic children tend to believe that there stomachs are full after eating a few bites because the nerves in there brains are unable to send the appropriate signals needed. Rumors have been spread that only few children are affected by this disorder but studys show that an eating disorder is common in 98% of autistic children.<br>  <br>  People may believe what they want, but the bottom line is that an eating disorder is common in autistic children!|`|pvDVFrKwaa	i dont know what proof you'll find. i have a young cousin thats severly autistic and he eats just fine. he's got a large appetite but most normal boys his age have that. it might be in some autistic children that are picky over what they eat alot of them develope obsessive compulsive disorders

ijFTx8Eoaa	hooping is a very good workout, but it takes some dedication and ENERGY for it to really work as a weight loss tool. I think if you want to focus on your thighs, you have to hoop around yer thighs, just as if you want to work out yer stomach you hoop around yer stomach. Hooping in general is a good core muscle workout, add some bouncy music and hopefully you have a very fun way to lose weight<br>  <br>  Aside from its benefits physically it's a lot of fun, and one of my  favorite things to do. There are countless videos of really good hoopers on youtube, and there is a community for hoopers here <a href="http://www.hooplab.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hooplab.org/</a>|`|3QUAl4cVaa	ahha hahh...stupid man!!!italy 4 ever!!

Try crossword puzzles, sodoku, learn a new skill or language, do chores with your left hand rather than your right(vice versa if you are left-handed), have a shower with your eyes closed(makes the brain work on other senses) The more you use memory the longer you keep it, however you only slow the loss down.|`|Cb0bdPdxaa	Actually, there is something very that us men can take after the age of 48 when our memory becomes weak.

I hope you will find another job that suits your interests.  Best Wishes.|`|Cb0bdPdxaa	I think you should find excitement in your life, outside of work that is. Maybe a girlfriend, going out or something to look forward to. If you feel very bored at work without motivation perhaps looking forward to the weekend or after work, it will motivate you to do better. If nothing works, then, you ought to start looking for a better job or even move out to a different place, if you're single that is. Otherwise, it would be very hard.|`|7Q3Rb0lIaa	You dont like your job. Plain and simple. You are bored with your job, so it makes you bored at work. Or you would rather stay up late at night and let me guess... you are a video gamer? Or just an internet freak? (nothing bad or wrong with it) <br>  But look at it as a drug. You want to like your high... not love it.<br>  If you are a temp, then... why dont you look for something more interesting? Try a more hands on work field. Unless you like the office scene, then try switching companies and moving.<br>  Yes... if there is work, and you just are not doing it, than my friend you are lazy. You dug your ditch, now get out of it. If the money is not right for you, then go somewhere with better pay and more challenges for you to stay focused.

A9WCbC8aaa	Whatever workout you do make sure it is one that engages your muscles.  That is how you increase your heart rate and get into your fat burning zone.  There is a fun power yoga workout you can check out called the YRG Workout.  It is yoga based and they added in other exercise movements that will build your core and help you lose weight.  I do the online version 4 times a week, 40 minutes a day in my home.  Cutting out the foods you mentioned will instantly help you too.  Good Luck!|`|BbuG07ttaa	At least twenty mintues thirty would be better of cardio for you to sweat and start to burn fat and another thirty of weight lifting.Your weights can be as  little as 3-5 pounds if your not use to lifting weights.Building muscle helps you burn calories all day even after the work out while cardio burns more fat calories during the work out.|`|lkIcWsT3aa	Any physical activity where you give it your best effort and train seriously will yield you results if you are starting from an inactive lifestyle. These channels will certainly be better than just walking.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  I have one of these DVD's and for the first 2 weeks I had it, I used it every single day for 15-30 minutes. (It varied on different days). Now, I haven't been on it in about 2-3weeks, which is a bad habit so I really need to start getting back on it! But as long as you stay motivated and try and do the video at least once every few days, then you'll DEFINITELY see results. Walking is good, but these videos are better because it's cardio and it makes you burn more calories faster.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|nxzPUrHKaa	Ok, What ALL people wating to lose weight need to know, is not to lose Physical weight, but lose size!!!<br>  <br>  In  other words, lose Body Fat (Tape Measurements, as you can gain muscle n lost fat n yet still remain the same weight)<br>  <br>  So what you need to do, is eat Higher in Protein n less in Fats n Carbs (Which you are doing).<br>  <br>  You see, your body wants n craves Fats n Carbs.<br>  <br>  It will actually process your food in that order, Fats and Carbs and then Protein.<br>  <br>  So if you were to feed yourself higher protein, then your body would still need those fats n carbs, hence eating its own.<br>  <br>  Meaning, it will eat its own Body Fat stores<br>  <br>  Simple, Right:)<br>  <br>  As for Cardio, as long as you are in the fat burning range or are burning more calories than you are consuming, you'll be aye ok to losing that unwanted fat:)<br>  <br>  If you just want to walk (As thats what you like doing) then walk.<br>  If you want to do these other programs then go hard:)<br>  <br>  As long as you are in the Fat Burning Zone you'll achieve your goal.<br>  <br>  The good thing about Pilates, is that you will get stronger:)<br>  The Good Thing about Yoga is that you'll get more flexible (A bonus for your Partner as well, hahaha)<br>  <br>  And Cardio in general will make you Fitter, more Healthy, and you would have to agree it feels Great n Rewarding after you've finished a nice workout:) Wouldnt ya reckon? :)<br>  <br>  Now the Fat Burning Zone is this<br>  <br>  220 (Scentific Figure) - age = Maximum Heart Rate<br>  65%-70% of your Maximum Heart Rate is the Fat Burning Zone.<br>  <br>  example<br>  <br>  220 - 26years old = 194 (Maximum Heart Rate)<br>  194 x 0.65 = 126.1<br>  194 x 0.70 = 135.8<br>  <br>  So as you can see, a 26year old would have to keep his or her Heart Rate between 126 n 136 to be in the Fat Burning Zone<br>  <br>  It may not feel as though you are doing much, but this is using the Fat as Energy, rather than the glycogen Stores for Energy, (That which you'd be burning in a High Intensity Cardio session)<br>  <br>  Remember, we want to burn fat, not anything else:)<br>  <br>  Hope this Helped?<br>  Any Questions, Just email Me<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|4QiVYcviaa	The videos are great way to learn and follow.. you can do your yoga routine and still walking for 15 to 30 minutes, no problem.

5AaMDz91aa	Cutting is a hard thing to stop.  Especially since it can get addictive.  Here's what I do.  When you feel like you are going to cut, lie down and try to sleep.  If you can manage a 30 minute nap, when you wake up it will feel as if you don't need to cut.  If you can't sleep or anything of that sort, here's what I also do.  Look at the clock.  Say to yourself, "If I can make it 15 minutes without cutting, I won't cut."  And if that seems like too long, cut it down to five minutes.  After that first five minutes (which is hard) then add another five minutes.  Add it up to an hour.  By that time, you will hopfully be thinking more clearly.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WPZI510laa	talk to someone|`|AA11631715	a cutter will use any excuse to cut, so you will probably cut, if you dont choose to seek help.
AA10563860	It sounds as if you might have enough motivation to make a successful change in your life and body.  Being soooo young I would not think that you would have done much irreversible damage after only a year of not taking care of yourself (unless there is a strong family history of heart disease).<br>  As with anyone, start any increased physical activity slowly, keep it brief, and keep it fun.  The activities you choose shold be something you enjoy (or once enjoyed), so that you can stick with it.  Also keep it brief...don't invest hours be "physical" on the days you are feeling fat/bad...instead set aside 30-45 minutes before lunch time if possible to do your activity.  Anything longer can be a huge challenge to stick with uness you are ultra motivated like many people are Not.<br>  Also, I have said for year that 70-80% of the weight you will lose will be because of your food choices.  Don't over eat, avoid sugary foods (candy/snacks/pastries), eat breakfast every day, and don't eat after 7:00 p.m.<br>  <br>  Check your weight evry 2-4 weeks to see if you are staying on track.<br>  <br>  Also, if it took 1 year to gradually gain your excess weight...it will take aproximately 6 mos to lose it IF you can stick with it.<br>  Good Luck|`|CkN4pgpCaa	You are still young and have time to turn everything around.  But you have to be willing to start now.  If you do continue bad habits, you could put your heart and joints at serious risk in the next few years.  <br>  <br>  Start today-  get rid of the junk food and replace it with healthier foods.  Make an effort to cook more and try new recipes instead of eating out all of the time.  Start an activity that will cure the boredom and get you doing some physical activity.  Or try an exercise class that will force you to exercise and interact with people at the same time.  Or get a pedometer and challenge yourself to take more steps each day.   Even taking your (or a friend's or neighbor's) dog for a walk is a good start.  Just get out there and do something.. soon!

5F82CQ7Yaa	Yeah, we are supposed to get 8 hrs a day all together. Having them apart would actually make you more tired.|`|xChr07Wwaa	well from what I know about sleep, the stage of sleep that actually helps you feel awake in the morning is the REM state, which is the "dreaming state." You go through a cycle of stages while you sleep, and in the beginning of your night's sleep you have a shorter of the REM stage, and later on during your sleep the REM stages are much longer. You have to stay asleep for a while to get the long stages in REM that you need to feel rested. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped you!<br>  i love sleep. :)|`|AA10695673	i think we are supposed to get our 8 hours together. <br>  if you take a nap and then only sleep 6 hours at night, i think you would be tired.

I can't tell you how many people have come to me saying they want a 6-pack, and ask what ab work outs I recommend.<br>  To lose stomach fat, you have to do cardio. The stomach fat is by far the hardest to get rid of. The fastest way to do this, will take you more than a month(depending how much stomach fat you have).<br>  Run at least 30 minutes a day, for 4-5 days a week. You have to get your metabolism up, and burn calories. Running is the best way to do both of these.<br>  Once you get your stomach fat down, THEN you do ab work outs.<br>  Upper abs- crunches, sit ups, speed crunches<br>  Lower abs- 6 inches, leg raises, leg scissors<br>  Side abs- lay on your side, and do a "side crunch".<br>  "Ab killers"- lay on your back, and draw the numbers 1-10 with your legs.

Please go see your doctor.|`|4GYCaoP6aa	The feeling you're describing sounds like depersonalization. I know it's frustrating, and so incredibly hard to describe...<br>  It's like living in alternate reality while everyone else is in the real world.<br>  <br>  It's very common with depression, and lots of other mental disorders. Try mentioning to your Doctor that you're been experiencing depersonalization... I'm sure they can do something for you, weather it's a new medication, or altering the dosage of whatever you are taking now.

Perhaps about whether you count calories, or what you feeling towards food are etc<br>  <br>  Please don't be scared about seeing a doctor.

BhXwQ2n1aa	have you seen an eye doctor about this? if not, you definitely need to ASAP!
7z6BWoESaa	your blister is healing, thats what makes it scratchy, avoid peeling it off, that will only open it up and cause it to possibly get infection. lightly run it for relief or put on some cream neosporin is awesome
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|97a7d25a569ecc28c857f02a34b7fd9baa	I'm trying to get abs like you.  First you have to focus on getting flat abs.  You have to diet, and watch what you eat.  Watch how many calories you eat, and avois soda.  Limit sugar in your diet, and drink lots of water.  Eat fruit daily, and make sure your getting protein.  Get a gym membership.  Work-out 3 or 4 times a week, and do a 15-30 minutes of cardio, and weight-lift.  At home, do 3-4 sets of 20 push-ups, 100 crunches, and throw in some sit-ups.  It'll take time, and don't give up.
mrndKIYvaa	I am on day 5. No catheter here at all. I did get a drain because my gallbladder was about to burst so they did it to make sure nothing nasty like bile was draining from me. The drain was removed in 24 hours and I was allowed to go home.<br>  <br>  I ate a chicken salad sandwich about 6 hours after surgery and did fine. I then ate some cereal in the morning, and for dinner I had a hamburger patty with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes with bread and butter. All via the hospital.<br>  <br>  When I got home I ate cereal and blueberry muffins, and tonight (a little scared) I just tried a fresco steak taco! My only complaint has been heartburn but I have always had a lot of heartburn problems and to boot I am 11 weeks pregnant and still breastfeeding my 2 year old.<br>  <br>  I am off of pain pills, but the right shoulder pain from the gas has been the worse part. Just walk and stay mobile. Get that wretched gallbladder out before it kills you like mine almost did! You will feel better. Before it was out I needed 2 mg morphine in a pump every 1-2 hours to just feel "less" pain from the attacks I was suffering while in the hospital. I was terrified when they told me I needed surgery that night but I've been better with the surgery than without it. Plus I'd be dead without the surgery since my gallbladder was going to burst and kill me!
AA11550519	YOU SHOULD EAT MORE! If you run, do weights, play a ball sport often and do gym seriously, damn! <br>  <br>  See, if you're active and restricting calories, your body becomes even clingier with calories. Keep this up, and recovery will be slowed down, fitness may even reverse! Just eat healthy. You probably know what that is by now. 1800 cals or so, 30%protein, lots of complex carbs etc, and you'll be great.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the spot reduction myth was dealt with years ago! Losing fat anywhere involves losing fat everywhere! Leg exercises (like squats) are some of the best for losing belly fat. Get my drift? So any fat you lose off your 'pillows' will be only a part of what you lose. And at 125 lbs, you don't have much left to lose.

5AaMDz91aa	Yes, this does sound like depression.  Especially the part that it's normally at home when you feel like this shows that you feel different when you are by yourself.  I think that you should really talk to your school counselor or talk to a real doctor about this.  They can help a lot.  <br>  <br>  -K
9XDe0Zyuaa	If you can't get a break to the bathroom after you eat, just swish some water around in your mouth. That will get the worse pieces of food out of your teeth! Also try carrying a hand mirror or something then you can do a quick check to make sure they look fine. I have braces and because of school, I don't have the time to brush after lunch so this is what I do. Don't worry though. As long as you brush in the morning and most importantly at night you'll be fine ;)<br>  <br>  I Hope I Helped And Enjoy Your Smile!!|`|KxefTNDcaa	When I got my braces on I used to be like you and always brushing my teeth after meals. For a while you should do that until you get used to the braces. After a while when you're used to them you'll be able to feel if there's something in your teeth or not. When I first got mine on I asked my friends how come they didn't need to clean their teeth all the time when I did. It's just something you figure out on your own, really there's no technique. I guess you can carry around a mirror, but eventually you wont even notice your braces or be so freaked out about having stuff in your teeth, you just learn to live with them.|`|wOecmtrzaa	Yeah, make absolute sure that you swish with water after every meal or snack, even if you can't brush.<br>  <br>  I even did that before I brushed, just so I wasn't sweeping food bits around my mouth and rubbing them all over my teeth!

Ovarian pain is lower.|`|aMpOirsnaa	Appendicitis?<br>  <br>  Talk to your doc.
KxefTNDcaa	If you really need to take out the retainer, just be really careful when you eat. Even if you do break the brackets on the braces they are fixable, but braces don't help fix your teeth when they're broken and can get a little annoying. Plus it could cost extra if you break too many of them.<br>  Don't worry, this probably won't last for long. When I first got my braces on I couldn't put my back teeth together because the braces were in the way. My teeth started to shift after a few days, or around a week, and now I don't even notice the braces. <br>  You can stick to soft foods for now, and things that you only need to chew a little bit to swallow.<br>  P.s-smoothies are good(fav fruit, yogurt, sugar, and milk-easy and yum to eat)<br>  :)

ZERO TOLERANCE by your friends is in everybodys best interest.<br>  <br>  the only solution for addicts is zero.. none.. cold turky..  .. dont rely on shrinks that will bleed you forever for their personal wealth (curing you would make them lose a steady easy income) .. you have to quit..

Your shaking was withdrawal from alcohol.<br>  <br>  YES, I think you're addicted.  It's very serious, especially since you're so young.  Since you're still growing, you've probably already done a lot of damage to your body, especially your liver.<br>  <br>  You need to get help now, for yourself.  Hurry.  Tell someone, if you can't talk to your parents, try a school counselor or some other adult that you trust.  It'll be hard, but please, do it.  <br>  Although, you need to do this for yourself more than for your boyfriend, maybe he can help you find someone so you can get help.|`|yTD67IwFaa	Not to sound like a mother or anything sweetie but you are quite young to be drinking and having drinking urgencies. Your bf cares about you that much that he doesnt want to see you drinking and have health problems later on.<br>  <br>  Looking for something in every certain occassion (which is in your case maybe problems, stress, etc.) can be considered the first few stages of addiction so please try to avoid it as much as possible.<br>  <br>  When you get older, sure you can drink wine here and there.

You're drinking to avoid feeling uncomfortable feelings, but the more you do that, the more things get mixed up. Uncomfortable or upsetting feelings that are doused in alcohol don't go away, they just resurface later. And adding dangerous and unhealthy behavior makes it worse and can quickly take over your life. It seems like your boyfriend is concerned for a good reason. This kind of behavior is hard to change, but the sooner you address it the better off you'll be. You only have one life. Is there an adult that you trust enough to confide in? That would be a good start. Good luck and take care of you.|`|PVe6jK78aa	Wine coolers and Mike hard lemonade are barely alcoholic drinks its more of a mental dependence.

1oBilGHuaa	I would hope he left the name of a person and their phone number while he is gone.  If he didn't and you cannot reach him, you might want to find someone else.  You could call a local Mental Health Clinic or the Department of Psychiatry at a local hospital.  These places have psychiatrist, psychologists and social workers on their staff.  If the person you were seeing at one of these places had to be away, they would most likely let you talk to someone else while they were away.  I hope you will find someone to talk to.  Please do what you need to do to get some help now, if this is what you need.  Best Wishes to you.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Your condition is fragile.  Here are some things to do to "rescue" yourself.<br>  -- look back over your counseling notes, searching for what "to do" when you are stressed<br>  -- every counselor, when away, leaves the phone number of someone who can be contacted by phone to respond to questions and to urgent situations for his clients.   Call your Counselor's number, there will probably be a recording with the number of the substitute counselor<br>  -- call the substitute counselor. Think about your upsetness. Ask the 2 or 3 pressing questions you have written down - write down the answers the substitute counselor gives you. (So you can refer back to it)

xMlL7CKcaa	Its good that you are asking questions about this disease.  I didn't think I was ever at risk for cancer, there is absolutely no history of it in my family.  There is no reason to live your life with a fear of getting cancer, but its always good to be aware of some of the known causes just as it is to watch out for any illness.  Living a clean healthy lifestyle is always a good thing, altho it doesn't always take away the threat. I was vegetarian for 15 yrs and still dx'd with terminal cancer.  But you just can't live your life in total fear, or you won't do much living.  <br>   Yes, cancer can be painful..  I live in constant pain.  And you ask what we do if we get it?  We FIGHT.. we try to survive and many of us do.  We all have to live our lives the best we can, and have fun while doing it... regardless if with cancer or not. <br>  Live, and be happy!!|`|FicyC2TXaa	Don't worry, you're almost certainly not at increased risk of cancer.<br>  <br>  Hereditary cancer is rare - fewer than 10% of all cancer cases are hereditary.<br>  <br>  A sign that a cancer MAY be hereditary within a family is when several members of the same side of that family have had the SAME type of cancer, especially if some developed it at a younger than usual age.<br>  <br>  You don't inherit a general tendency to get cancer, and several family members having had different types of cancer isn't hereditary.<br>  <br>  And cancer that's diagnosed after the age of 50 is less likely to be hereditary.
2p39nEdHaa	I would suggest going to see your doctor. It doesn't really sound like asthma. I have exercise induced asthma and I start wheezing really badly. If you are wheezing then it could be. Your doctor could tell you if you have asthma or not.|`|fF1WbPltaa	Asthma usually presents with wheeziness, a constant cough and shortness of breath. Do you have these?
MofRRzlzaa	Try Degree Clinical Protection. It works for me. Drink water to cool off the body so you don't have to sweat. Or Gatorade, that replenish your body so sweat can't come out.|`|wOcIxJYaaa	sweat is water, drinking more water won't decrease the amount of sweat you have. If you live in a hot environment that is probably the reason you sweat.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Drinking more water can't hurt.<br>  <br>  You might try using a decent antiperspirant though. Mnay of them are next to useless but I find Men's Labs works ok.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Shave your under arm hair & apply deodorant INTO the skin to help stop perspiration/odor.  If you apply deodoroant/anti perspirant on TOP of the under arm hair, it does NOT reach the skin.  Sweat runs down the hair shaft, mixes w/deodorant & drips onto your clothing leaving a wet spot or a stain.  Wear a lightweight cotton undershirt w/sleeves to help absorb perspiration.  Drinking more water helps the body but does not stop perspiration.  Perspiration is the body's natural air conditioning system - it helps to cool off the body.

If not, and she's alone, please get her some help..or at least make sure she's okay.<br>  <br>  *hugs*<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  The postictal state is the altered state of consciousness that a person enters after experiencing an epileptic seizure, such as those occurring with frontal lobe epilepsy. It usually lasts between 5 and 30 minutes, but sometimes longer in the case of larger or more severe seizures and is characterized by drowsiness, confusion, nausea, hypertension, headache or migraine and other disorienting symptoms. Additionally, emergence from this period is often accompanied by amnesia or other memory defects. It is during this period that the brain recovers from the trauma of the seizure.|`|sZvvYlihaa	I have seizures so i know that it definately is possible!<br>  U can have them for a couple of seconds and then its gone... in my case i shake or stutter and you feel totally lost and helpless cuz its like wth is goin on?? have you ever had a moment where u just blacked out? well its the same thing except ur shaking.. then when ur awake or conscoius you feel totally normal but a sense that u just lost a couple of seconds of your life and you have no idea what happened.....<br>  <br>  I have seizures soo im definately not joking when i say you can have them for a couple of seconds.. or less than 15 minutes
EMbaak9waa	I suggest you see a doctor for this one.|`|MvisyrRVaa	The only one that can answer this is an MD|`|8eb45b4c6ee01d5f00ffcb946d4ea1d1aa	It would be almost impossible to get this from an animal. It is common in dogs, cats, even raccoons, but although it could be transferred by mosquito, the worm would die within hours. It would not survive August until now.<br>  GO see your medic and get their advice. I am sending you the link for heart worms which is on wikipedia, hope this helps.|`|H4USFx3uaa	Well considering I am a nurse and have never even heard of heartworms (and I worked on a cardiac ward) and just had to google it - I would say that almost no humans have ever had it and that would make it very unlikely that you have it. <br>  <br>  You say you had an illness a while ago that was pretty bad and now you are coughing up blood? - have you thought about seeing a doctor about this? Chances are you picked up a chest infection after your illness a while back while your immune system was still recovering. Go see your Doc and get some antibiotics if necessary.<br>  <br>  Good luck and feel better.|`|7DY3fCdraa	wow..................prob sinus or lung infection....heart worms are relllllllllllly rare in humans............
o2iQyNKuaa	wow i thought i was the only one, except the line on my face is more of a slightly darker color than my skin. I only notice it when i focus hard enough in the mirror<br>  but i am sorry that i don't know what causes it.
12163ea75fba51aa78ddcde57cc67f2caa	I have been taking adderall without a perscription for a few years, usually only for studying/tests, and the side effects aren't anything to be too concerned about, however the severity of them depends on the dosage. The most common "bad" effects are feeling jittery, tachycardia (increased heart rate), paranioa and mood swings. You will definately notice some changes in mindset and amounts of concentration, as well as dry-mouth (which is very common). For the most part, adderall has really helped me stay focused, concentrate, and not feel hungry all the time, which isnt too bad :)|`|WPZI510laa	it makes me focus and it makes you not hungry so you dont eat.  But not eating or drinking is very bad for you, and ive fainted many times when i took it, because i cant eat.|`|8j6Az9mXaa	well your friends are right it make you not want to eat and helps you focus but to much of it can get you "high" and it just makes you kind of shaky and diffficlut to walk but it feels really good i just wouldnt take any more than one pills unless its like 10 mg
8f88988d153997a17a65bb17a47f9839aa	ASSUMING you don't have any astigmatism, people generally think contact lenses correct their myopia better than glasses.<br>  <br>  Daily lenses are healthier than monthly and continuous contact lenses. If you like going out drinking, coming home drunk go for the continuous wear lenses... they are soooooo nice especially the Purevision by B&L
tIldpr7vaa	push ups alone dont do very much, if anything. But you already found that out.<br>  <br>  sorry but weights are the key to building muscle<br>  <br>  and u also need to eat enough and take in alot of protein to gain muscle<br>  <br>  if ur serious about gaining muscle u need a weekly weight lifting routine. Getting bigger is by no means easy.

XzV4bUeFaa	It takes a while.  Depending on how severe the infection is and how well the antiobiotic is working.  You can get fluid buildup in your ear which can last after the infection.  Best thing to do is finish all antibiotic.  Then if a couple days after that you still have pain or if ear still feels clogged, go back to Doctor.
nhLvrVx9aa	Not sure Tom we are all different and start at different times.<br>  <br>  I know I started when I was 14, but some have started sooner then that.<br>  So depending on how old you are, it could be any time.<br>  <br>  As to when is the best time to do it... Most do it at night when they are laying in bed before they go to sleep.<br>  It also depends on how much privacy you have. Some do it in the shower, for me it takes me longer to do it if I'm standing up then if I'm laying down. So I use up all the hot water lol!<br>  Best of luck bud.|`|GQpTI2GWaa	Whenever the urge takes you. <br>  <br>  Best not to do it in public though, you can get in trouble for that...|`|EcCbforQaa	When you are mature enough you will squirt, normally around age 12-13.<br>  Masturbation is nothing to be scared of, it's a skill you will enjoy for the rest of your life.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	If you have a dew hairs around your pubic area that would signify that puberty has started , You should also be getting erection and if so you could start masturbating . If you are new to this it can take a bit of practise to understand how to reach orgasm <br>  However if you are early in puberty the first orgasms may just be dry , and then a few weeks after that you may just get some clear sticky fluid . At some stage after that you will begin to ejaculate when you orgasm , and as you get older the ejaculations will increase in volume and strength|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	Start it now just make sure when you do it the bathroom door is locked|`|XXbZAriNaa	11 years|`|B66y8c9caa	I start at 11|`|uK3EkOxRaa	You'll know when it happens. Pretty much right at the start of puberty. If you see some pubic hair growing, or hair growing anywhere else, try masturbating again. You'll see something new, and it'll probably make you happeh!<br>  <br>  I started at twelve. So, it can range I think from 11-15.|`|AwLl0CY0aa	NOW!!!!!!! IM doing it right now! start as soon as you can and do it often! Slap that bacon dude!|`|Tg3BWmVXaa	About 14 at around tea-time.|`|SpBpnqJ6aa	i started at 12 <br>  and you can start if you feel the urge|`|tS2nd6ALaa	any age and any time (as soon as u can)|`|wZojnfzuaa	Just Jack off!|`|OVtUnuYnaa	I started at 12|`|kyfLIiw2aa	im 13/14 and started when i was 12.<br>  dont b scared "lol" go to your bath room, lock the door, turn shower on (cold) (for noise purpose), put your hand on your nob, and enjoy, <br>  (the sink will COME in handy)
