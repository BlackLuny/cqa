20090203120656AAusJST	Local Businesses;United States;Dallas	Where Is The Best Place To Sell Acoustic Guitars?	OK, I have two cheap guitars - a 12 string acoustic guitar and a 6 string classical acoustic/electric guitar.  The classical was about $500 brand new and the 12-string was about $400 brand new.        I do not want to sell them to Guitar Center because they would buy a $500 guitar for $75, then hang it up on the wall with a $400 price tag as soon as you walk out the door.  Also, I am guessing pawn shops do the same thing, and if you sell on ebay you lose all your money on shipping or paypal/seller fees.  I have also tried CraigsList and nobody ever replies to my ad, even though these guitars are nice and in good condition with uploaded photos and all.      So...does anyone know how I can get th emost for thesr guitars without selling via Guitar Center, pawn shops, ebay or CraigsList?
