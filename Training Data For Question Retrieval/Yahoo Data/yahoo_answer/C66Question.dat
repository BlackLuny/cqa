20090303224217AAv6YhS	Politics & Government;Politics	It was Bush's fault because...well because?	Do people understand that what caused most of the economic problems that we have today?  The real estate market is 25% of the US economy.  Depending on where it is the rest of the economy generally follows.   Back in the 90's clinton implemented actions that forced lenders to approve loans to people with bad credit and low income.  This is sometimes called the sub-prime market or B loans.  These loans gave money to people to buy houses that they had no business owning.  Because money was so cheap and available housing prices went up.  People were then able to use home equity to get more credit.  Little obama was a major fan of these lending practises. This is what he did as a community organizer, he even protested two banks that were going to merge and not offer sub-prime loans.       Well this sub-prime market fell apart in the last few years just like so many people had warned.  Credit, the thing that keeps the economy moving, dried up effectively stopping the economy.  Banks and insurers began to fail.  Bush had only one part in all of this.  He sent numerous requests to Barney Frank to have him fix the problem. Franks boyfriend sat on the board at Fannie Mae so nothing happened.  Barney would rather his boyfriend stay rich than save the American people the trouble we face today.      Also, keep in mind that the economy was doing well from 2001-2006 when Congress fell to the democrats control.  So Bush and Congress  was able to keep the economy in the black after clinton left a shrinking economy and after 9/11 and with 2 wars taking place.      So how is this Bush's doing?  Should we just ignore the damage Congress has caused in the past 2 years?  Is clinton not to blame even though he started the issues that have us where we are today?      Please, give serious answer, and think first!

20090304061204AATh6mT	Politics & Government;Politics	Does anyone else find this the least bit disturbing?	"President Barack Obama will order martial law this year, the U.S. will split into six rump-states before 2011, and Russia and China will become the backbones of a new world order."      "There is a high probability that the collapse of the United States will occur by 2010"       -Putin, the former president who is now prime minister, has likened the United States to Nazi Germany's Third Reich and blames Washington for the global financial crisis-      -Panarin argued that Americans are in moral decline, saying their great psychological stress is evident from school shootings, the size of the prison population and the number of gay men.-      "I was there recently and things are far from good," he said. "What's happened is the collapse of the American dream."      -He predicted Russia and China would emerge from the economic turmoil stronger and said the two nations should work together, even to create a new currency to replace the U.S. dollar.-      *** Now, I know this is just a prediction.. But a few things caught my eye...   1. Martial Law: Knowing this prediction- Why would Obama enforce ML? He would be the most sought after man by rouge gunmen and would be hated for the fall of the USA. I think he likes himself too much to do that-    But on the other hand, perhaps he is in deep enough with this globalization that he would be an even more powerful 'leader'...       2. I thought Russia was starting to be more friendly and wanted to help us in the Middle East? .. or are they just snuggling up?    It says here in the article that the Kremlin 'wouldnt mind' if we believed this guys predictions- they obviously want a chunk of our country in "The End"...      3. He is right about the moral downfall of our country..... not that Russia's are much better- they seem to be all about sex, drinking, drugs, power etc. (but at least its not gay sex lol)      4. If the US did split into 6 states and they did come up with a new currency- it would make a perfect opportunity to do away with cash all together and convert everyone to using the microchip idea.       -For those of you who believe in the end time prophecy, it would also make a perfect set up for the anti-christ in this 'new world order'- which would probably lead to a huge war between the new super powers (China and Russia) and fight over who is most powerful, land, etc-         **Read the article, tell me what you think**    http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/arti...

Please note - Carter didn't change much from LBJ, Nixon and Ford - they were "all Keynesians here."    And Clinton and Bush didn't change much from Reagan - they opened up markets, cut tariffs, cut most tax rates and deregulated entire industries - and Clinton signed significant welfare reform.      I.e., 1970s policies were the same as those of the 1960s, while 1990s policies were mostly unchanged from the 1980s - in fact you could argue that Clinton pushed further in the free market direction (whether or not you credit the GOP-led Congress with that, he did sign the bills) than his immediate predecessor, Bush, who broke his no new taxes pledge and signed the ADA into law.

It is not like the state governments, whose powers are more general. Charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government.” — James Madison      How does this square with Obama and the Left's version of the Constitution, where the Federal Government is responsible for everything?

So all I gots to ask is, "where's my money? Huh? Where's my money?"      OKay, seriously, where is it?      2.

20090304071046AArTyML	Politics & Government;Politics	Have you left your political party and become an independent?	I have watched Lou Dobbs on CNN and agree with him on much of what he has to say. He was talking about becoming an independent instead of staying with a political party. I became a Democrat in 1976 and remained with the party until 2008 (I supported Hillary Clinton). When the leaders of the party supported Obama, I knew that the party was no longer like the party I joined 32 years previously. Democrats once were for the common man and supported the working class. As I looked at the party of today realize that it has become elitist and has taken a hard turn to the left even since Bill Clinton. I left the party in June and voted for John McCain in the election because he was more moderate like me and I also believe in fiscal responsibility which is something I have not seen in Obama who advocates huge government spending. I also have some friends who were Republicans who became independent because they thought the Bush administration sold them out with wasteful spending and corruption throughout the party. I was wondering how many people in American are also disenchanted by the 2 parties who are in power.

20090304070920AAjh3Ie	Politics & Government;Politics	Is time to take a 'Good close look at Capitalism' as it is practiced in most parts of the world?	The definition of Capitalism:    'An economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately or corporately owned and development is proportionate to the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market.'   A critical part of the definition of capitalism is the idea of laissez-faire, a French term which roughly translates into "allow to do" or "leave alone."   This is what many so called 'Conservatives' around the world believe especially here in America. The less regulated.. businesses are, the more than can operate and stimulate business. At least this is the argument. But does it really make sense? If all us really take a step back into history and understand that through Capitalism, the common man invested in companies so that said companies could produce goods and or services that said investor needed in his or her community or state. As time progressed investments were soon made in many companies with the sole purpose of making money on the return from their investment. Now with 'speculators' and millions literally 'playing' the stock market, the whole concept of what Capitalism was meant to do has changed dramatically.   Economist Thomas Sowell described it this way:   "When an investment is made, whether to build a railroad or to open a new restaurant, the first money is spent hiring the people to do the work. Without that, nothing happens. Even when one person decides to operate a store or hamburger stand without employees, that person must first pay somebody to deliver the goods that are going to be sold. Money goes out first to pay expenses and then comes back as profits later—if at all. The high rate of failure of new businesses makes painfully clear that there is nothing inevitable about the money coming back."   But who is investing in the small businesses of today?...no one! People don't invest in small businesses today for the sole purpose of said business to succeed. For the most part, people invest today to get rich.   Moreover, individuals and corporations have violated the principles of fair trade, by concealing and falsifying information, and while their own personal freedom and wealth may be enhanced, both society and the free market they have conned are suffering.    So I ask in all seriousness, do we all need to take a good close look at how we operate as Society, and if more and stiffer government regulations are not the answers....then what are?   I would really like to some unbiased thought on this issue.

How many innocent lives have been lost because a group of corporate monsters decided they could rob the Iraqi people of their oil, and so the then most powerful nation started a war that went on to become a robbery   This will never go away as those who know Arabs will know that not only are they the most generous they are also the most traditionalists and that when it comes to you doing them a wrong you you must do everything in your power to make amends otherwise to take a life means it can only by cleansed with blood. This I know may sound barbaric but open your eyes, you only have to go to the local cinema to see that this kind of justice ingrained into our culture as almost every action film we see is based on these & very similar philosophies (An eye for an eye) and wasn't that the knee jerk reaction that got America to start a war on Afghanistan over one man and a few hundred Muhajadeen that would be like the KKK bombing Lloyds and Britain carpet bombing the United States.      What I would really love to know is how would Americans/British/French/Italians etc, etc feel if this wrong had been done to them, seen their houses bombed, families/friends murdered just for its natural resources,      Everyone knows that Iraq was no threat to America, but what about North Korea, China, Russia, and even Iran I don't see them being invaded/murdered!      I call for a war crimes tribunal to expose these atrocities.      What that the Bush administration has done is comparable with the deeds of Adolf Hitler's and only because it was the Arabs that were murdered are they being allowed to get away with it       If Barack wants to call himself a president then he must first act like one and make amends by punishing the wrong doers.

20090304104501AA1hK6W	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do you think child molesters should be entitled to a trial? What's a fair punishment?	What do you think would be a fail punishment for Child molesters? Some people just don't deserve trials. I've seen the sickest of people get off and it's just 100% wrong. I don't even see the point to a trial when all the evidence points to the person. Today I read about a person who was caught in a video molesting a two year old child. Why do people like that  deserve a trial?  They ruin the lives of innocent people and then get a slap on the wrist. I think sex offenders should be castrated, as sick as it sounds, it's fair if you ask me.  At the least they deserve life.

20090304102751AAe5Ztu	Politics & Government;Military	Do you think there is too much DISCRIMINATION IN THE MILITARY?	There are several ways to discriminate against a person:      1- Gender   2- Race   3- Age   4- ASVAB score   5- Criminal Background      I was never discriminated against so this is not my beef... but I feel many others have been.      I am male.  I am White.  I joined the Army at 24 and scored the highest PT results in my company.  I scored well over 90 on my ASVAB.  I also have not a blemish on my record... not to say I've never done anything wrong, I've done plenty - I just never got caught.  I was lucky to make the requirements.  Or was i just not discriminated against.  Lets find out.         AGE- The biggest discrimination I've seen over the years in the military has been AGE!   Being a certain age does not qualify you to do anything except be a certain age.  All 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 year olds  etc etc etc.. do not perform the same, look the same, or have the same mental maturity or capacity because of when they were born.  I've seen over qualified applicants get turned down and well under qualified applicants accepted simply because they fall in the discriminatory age range set.  Does Brad Pitt look like a typical 45 year old?  Does he look 18 years past when the Air Force says (27) he can no longer do what other 27 year olds can do?  How about Leonardo Dicaprio?  Does he look 35 years old?  I've seen 20 year old bald men with full beards in the military look 10 years older than DiCaprio and he's 15 years older than them.  Both of these are examples of people that don't age or look the age of their peers, or even their younger counterparts.  Many many men far exceed the physical youth of men many years younger, not only in the looks department... but clearly in the physical and mental department.  So what is the discrimination for?  If not looks, not mental capacity for sure, not physical capacity.  There is no use for it.  You can't say what a 27 year old is supposed to look like let alone what his capabilities are.  There was a guy on here a few weeks ago asking about joining the Marine Corps and wondered if he was fit enough and looked youthful enough.  The answerer's said yes go for it... he was ripped looked 21 years old.  The guy was 35 years old.  I doubt most 17-21 year old would have a chance in hell of competing with this other guy I know of when he was over 50, heck 60 even 70 he would dominate a 20 year old in the physical youth department!     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIVfe-crH...       GENDER - Gender would be next... but 95% of the jobs are available to women.  There may not be enough women that can actually make the physical demands of the job they are cut out of... to make a difference.  But, there are still those that can and that is a waste ... there are plenty of useless male soldiers in the military that end up being a bullet sponge because they didn't have what it takes, and could have easily been replaced by a hard charging woman that could have saved that man his life.  The best qualified for the job should not be set by any standard other than can they DO the job.  PERIOD       ASVAB - Some could have been nervous on the ASVAB and also could be bad test takers.  Those questions don't really relate to battle at all.  Understanding the word "chide" isn't going to help you be a better soldier and certainly doesn't qualify you for a military position.  This test in no way equates to your ability to do that job or not.  Whoever thinks it does is a fool.       CRIMINAL BACKGROUND - Lets face it, unless you have a bunch of felonies on there... a background check has no merit.  All it says is whose been lucky enough to not be caught.  I was never caught doing anything illegal.  Although I have escaped many tickets and many times i drove under the influence and never been caught.  Your record is a matter of luck when it comes to misdemeanors... a lot of hypocrites in the military will make you out to be the bad guy because you got caught.  I don't buy it.  We all break the laws, some worse than others and that will show... but the average person denied from the military on drug charges is a shame especially when they were well over qualified but they got caught once or twice under the influence or what not.  Its not like the military never went near alcohol.. get serious.. HIPOCRISEY!      RACE - Well, that seems to be the only one we've moved passed.  No longer do we enslave people because of the color of their skin..RIDICULOUS!  We now elect them and make them Commander in Chief of the military.  Thank God we've opened up one eye.  How about opening up the other.  Still a lot of discrimination in the military.      I feel it is wrong for every woman to be held out of a position when she clearly could do the job, every 37 year old physical stud denied access and he dominates guys 10 to 15 years younger than him physically, mentally, and he even looks their age he's aged so well, every person who missed a position they had their heart into now are stuck with something they don't out the effort into becaus

I had to put this in the order of a question, but it is a serious warning to you.  If you get an email page that your ordered something from ebay and it looks official, and tells you thanks for your order and that they received your payment, please immediatly go to the ebay site, click on help and it will give you the choice to live talk.  Before you do this, print out the "fake" copy sent to you so that you can give them the number of the item and the name of the seller.  What happened is that a 3rd party compormised my account, using my name. It is called phishing and it is serious.  After I finished "finger talking" to the help line, they told me to send a letter to:  spoof@yahoo.com where I again had to type in information from the copy of the letter sent to me.  What happens is people make a copy of the ebay website that looks official so then if you click on it, and reply to them, it could cause a problem.  DO NOT give them your personal information.  I also had to click on "my ebay" to see if there was any of this information there and thank goodness, there wasn't. I still need to check my credit card with he bank to see if it has unauthorized use on it as this person's name was familiar to someone I bought with a year and a half ago.     I hope this doesn't happen to you, but please be aware that your name is floating out there in cyberspace and it can happen.  Thanks for reading this.  I just feel the need to warn people.

20090304114557AAlzfe1	Politics & Government;Politics	What is it about Rush Limbaugh that is supposedly fascist/racist/intolerant/extr…	I don't listen to Rush Limbaugh on a regular basis.  Truth be told, I've never listened to his radio program in my life.  In fact, from what I heard, he was teetering on the brink of obscurity overall until Obama's hissy-fit over someone disagreeing with him publicly boosted his appeal and brought him back into the spotlight.        I've always heard that Rush is supposed to be this extremist, fascist, racist, evil man, but after watching to his first address to the nation last weekend, I didn't hear anything that would support that idea.  In fact, most of what he said was pretty common-sense criticism of our spender-in-chief, Barack Obama and a repeat of the standard conservative philosophy, none of which I can find fault with.      So what is it exactly that is supposed to be so hateful and over-the-top about this guy?  I've been hearing this for years, and after what I've seen so far, I am less inclined to believe it.

The group, which calls itself Accountability Now, plans to raise money online and recruit liberal candidates to run in the primaries against Democratic incumbents it considers out of step with constituents.

Trillions of taxpayer dollars thrown at these Wall Street banks and their executives. These banks totally mismanaged their finances, deceived their customers with flawed mortgages such as ARMs and interest-only loans and raped people with excessive banking and credit card fees. No accountability of where our money goes. Yet we continue to throw good money after bad with another $750 billion in TARP funds. This is so much money that every loan and mortgage in the U.S.A. could have been paid off. All we get are falling stock markets and ever rising bank fees.      Are we paying the price of socialism without the benefits of socialism by bailing out some failing private institutions (banks) while letting many others die (stores, small businesses etc)?

20090304110458AAFPAnv	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Was enough info. provided for him to be charged?	Asked this twice, got no answers, so here I go again...      In 1970, the plaintiff, Edward Reibl, then 44 years of age, was told by his doctor, Robert Hughes, that the cause of his high blood pressure and headaches was a partially plugged artery in his neck. The artery allowed only 10 to 15 percent of the blood to get through to the brain. The doctor indicated that this problem posed a 10 percent risk of causing a stroke each year it remained untreated, and advised his patient to have surgery. However, Hughes had failed to tell Reibl that the surgery carried a 4 percent risk of death and a 10 percent risk of stroke either during the operation or soon after surgery. Reibl accepted the doctor’s advice and consented to having the operation done right away, although he had the impression that there was no rush. The surgery could have been delayed until after Reibl’s retirement pension income was assured, 18 months later. Although the doctor performed the operation with proper care and competence, Reibl suffered a massive stroke soon afterward and was left with a paralyzed right arm and a lame leg. Because of his paralysis,, Reibl could no longer continue in his job and was ineligible for certain disability benefits from his employer. Reibl took legal action in the Supreme Court of Ontario in 1977. The trial judge found the defendant surgeon liable, awarding Reibl damages of $225 000. Hughes appealed this decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal, where a 2-1 decision ordered a new trial. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada where, in a unanimous decision, the trial judgement was restored.      Why did the courts find the defendant doctor at fault?   Did the patient give informed consent? Explain.   What do you think a reasonable person in Reibl’s position would have decided if all the risks had been fully explained?   What is the significance of the Supreme Court of Canada decision?

Hey Everyone,      Well recently i was asked by my eventually to be husbands mom to pay the tax's on a house that's been in there family a long time but i am a bit concerned on the laws and/or rules of doing this.      Here is the story. The great grand mother died and did not leave a will. She had 3 children but only one of her children still live in Mississippi the others have moved away and  we have no idea where they live or even if they exist anymore.Because they can not get a hold of the other 2 kids of the great grand mother no blood relative can claim the house as there's.They said they could try to put it in the daughters name, but from the sound of it they could still end up loosing the house.       Anyway for years her daughter (one of her children) has been paying the tax's and then the daughters kids have been paying the taxes as well. So for the last 20 or more years the daughter and her kids have been taking turns paying the taxes. However, this year the state said no blood relative can pay on the house anymore. The issue is, is that if no one pays the taxes then the house will go to the state. So the family has asked me to pay the taxes since i am no blood relative. I was told by one of the relatives that if i paid the taxes on the house for a few years that in a few years time that i could legally take over the house and put it in my name.      I know this is obviously a question for a lawyer but i wanted to do some research myself before seeing a lawyer. However, i am not sure what to type into  the search engine or where can i look online for the laws or rules on property tax in Mississippi? if anyone could lead me in the direction of where i can find the laws or rules on this i would really appreciate it.      Thank you,   Rachel

Iran investing in stem cells      Thirty years after the toppling of the Shah in Iran, the nation is undergoing another revolution of sorts. Iran is investing heavily in stem cell research, and despite researchers working with limited access to laboratory equipment and resources, the country may emerge as a scientific force to be reckoned with in the stem cell field.         Even with their limited infrastructure, Iranian scientists have managed to isolate six human and eight mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines over the past decade, and then successfully turn these cells into functional pancreatic, heart, splenic, and liver cells. "It's remarkable that they were able to do what they've done," Konrad Hochedlinger of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital told The Scientist. "They are clearly catching up."      Unlike many western countries, where religious wranglings have hindered the progress of ESC research, in Iran and other Islamic countries research involving embryos is relatively uncontroversial. Islamic law states that full human life begins only after the "ensoulment" of the fetus, which is defined in the Quran as 120 days after conception. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, even publicly endorsed human embryo research in 2002.      -The Scientist Magazine

I was Honorably discharged from the Navy in 2004 ( I have my DD 214 to prove it) and now I'm considering enlisting in the Army. I was arrested at 14 or 15 yrs old, I really don't remember. (A one time offense that I regret).  I fully disclosed this information to the Navy recruiter with no problem when I first enlisted into the Military but now the Army is telling me that I might have a problem joining because of my juvenile record. Is that normal? Why did the Navy except me with arms wide open and now the Army is hesitant in considering me for enlistment?

20090304112444AAH2fQr	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I am possibly being charged with Aggravated Assault. Opinions Please.?	On Feb. 28 2009 I was camping with some friends at the Little Sahara Sand Dunes in Utah.  At around 9 or 10 oclock my friend, my little brother and I were riding around on a four-wheeler riding wheelies(Grizzly 450). We were going by the other camps doing it and they were loving it and cheering us on. We were riding by and making sure we weren't going to hit anything or anyone. The last camp we rode through got very upset and so we left and weren't going to come back. Once we got outside the camp we started to wheelie again, the four-wheeler stalled. While the four-wheeler was stalled the people caught up to us, one ahead of the rest. He started screaming at us(F*** You, What the F***, You guys want your f***ing a**es kicked!). At first we started to apologize, but the guy kept saying we were getting our a**es kicked and started pushing us and trying to push my friend off the four-wheeler.  At this point I stepped off the machine so I could be standing if anything happened, at the same moment I started hearing voices screaming "F*** those mother f***ers, let's f*** them up!". There were around 15+ of them and four of us, of which two were my little brother and my buddies nephew. I turned around and hit the first kid hard, knocking him unconscious. Then was tackled by someone, my buddy jumped on him and started hitting him. I stood up and was being pushed by two people one of which swung and hit me behind my left ear, I then hit him knocking him loopy cause he was stumbling for a second before dropping to the ground. Mind also that this place has a very bad reputation for a mob beating the hell out of 4-5 people sending them to the hospital with serious injuries(has happened to 4 of my friends already). Apparently one of the kids has a broken jaw(I'm guessing the one I hit first, it was a very hard punch.), and while taking him to the hospital they got pulled over for speeding then explaining why. Causing the police to get involved, I just don't understand how these allegations can be made when the other party started the assault and out numbered us greatly. Thank you for your time.

Liberals tax fairness is just like their political correctness and their fairness doctrine for the media. Liberals don't want fairness; they want it all...as long as it yours and not theirs things are not fair.       ? We are anti-Family. We don't believe in the husband and wife family. We believe that every household should be a single-parent household and that single-parent should be married to the gov't.      ? We believe in liberal education. No test, no scale of pass or fail. You pass if you believe in gays rights, abortion, anti-God and anti-democracy. If you are unable to get into college it isn't your fault it is because of your race or gender.       ? We believe in taxing everyone and everything. Why to promote liberalism. The only way liberalism can be successful is by re-distribution of wealth.      ? G. Gordon Liddy quote: A liberal is someone who feels a great debt to his fellow man; a debt he proposes to pay off with your money      ? Liberals are only "fair" and "liberal" when you agree with everything they think, if you don't, you are a racist or an idiot neo-con. Just ask them, they will tell you.   ? Truth is just an obstacle to overcome    We are pro-civil rights as long as they are the rights of minorities, gays and foreigners.      We are anti-God. We believe everyone should have the right to sin and experiment with sin. We do not believe that God should judge us. We don't believe in consequences or actions as long as we can blame someone else.         SO what about conservatives ??

But I was just wondering if there are any laws or permits that I would need to get before I could do this or any agencies that I would have to contact or that my goal would benifit from me contacting?   Thanks in advance!
20090304125624AARwfb1	Politics & Government;Elections	Rush to Obama, debate me, where can Obama hide to save face?	Obama is S/F/O      Mr. President, you know what, I know these are tough economic times, and you're trying to convince people that you're "saving" the taxpayers money, that you're cutting spending, that you're cutting the deficit.  In that vein, I, Mr. President, will send my jet, EIB One, to pick you up and bring you here and take you back to wherever you want to go.  You'd love it.  It's not as big and luxurious as your jet, but it's got enough seats for your Secret Service detail.  But it is something to behold.  I'm very proud of it, Mr. President.  I worked for it.  I paid for it.  Taxpayers pay you for your travel.  Nobody pays me for mine.  I pay for it.  I pay for the airplane.  I pay for the travel.  I pay for practically everything I do.  We can talk about that, too.  I could tell you what that's like.
20090304124318AA7nTUq	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	How would you like to get this from Wal-Mart?	A customer shopping at a Wal-Mart for a wallet claims he found something that definitely didn't fit the bill: human teeth.      Police say the man found 10 human teeth Saturday when he unzipped a compartment in the wallet. One tooth had a filling.      The customer turned the wallet and the teeth over to employees at the Falmouth store but left without giving his name.      Police investigating the incident told The Cape Cod Times that the teeth belong to an adult, but since there was no blood or gum tissue on the teeth, they would be unable to perform DNA tests.      A Walmart spokeswoman said the company believes it was an "isolated incident," but will investigate.

20090304125345AAN5Dz6	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this getting ridiculous? ANOTHER TAX CHEAT in the Obama Administration?!?!?	Another Obama pick owes back taxes, but it's OK because, now caught, he'll pay up      Word today that yet another Barack Obama appointee has a little problem with taxes -- a $10,000 problem.      Ron Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas who would be the White House chief trade representative if confirmed, didn't pay taxes on some speaking fees he donated to his alma mater and he tried to write off the full $17,000 costs of his Dallas Mavericks season tickets.      Not sure if we have room here to list every other would-be Obama appointee who turns out to have some tax problems. There was Timothy Geithner, who's now Treasury Secretary in charge of the IRS.       But being as articulate as he is and so well-versed in handling other people's money, he was deemed essential to the fight against the economic downturn and that's worked out real well. Just look at the markets.      There was Tom Daschle, who was deemed essential to the effort to completely reform the nation's health care system.       And there was Nancy Killefer, whose performance as would-be chief performance officer was also self-terminated when she turned out to have had a past tax problem. And Bill Richardson pulled out of Commerce not because of taxes but because of a federal pay-to-play probe.       And Rep. Hilda Solis, whose husband had some tax liens going back 16 years until the day before her committee vote as Labor secretary. But who in their right mind would hold a wife responsible for her husband's financial problems, even if they did start the same year she was elected to the state legislature?        http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washingt...

20090304125738AAE9BuW	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can a collections agency sue me from a different state across the country?	Someone who has not fulfilled part of their contractual agreement is threatening to sue me of around $400 to "collect a debt" on top of the $1500 I already sent them. The deal was a ripoff and I have refused to pay. They did not fulfill the contract.      They sent an email stating that the the deal took place in their state which means if they sue me and I don't show up then they win by default.      The contract did not mention anything about jurisdiction. I live on the east coast and they live on the west coast so obviously making the court to fight the lawsuit is not worth the trip.      How should I handle this?      Should I sue them for the full amount? What if they try to hurt my credit? (I'm sure they'll try) Unfortunately, the amount is so small it's not even worth spending a few hundred bucks for a lawyer.

Has the time come for the soldiers among the gangs to lay down arms and regroup into the schools. Knowledge is coming to feed you and your children.

The government has now acknowledged the importance  of all our ghetto soldiers. Grants are now available to expand the potential of each and every soldier in fields of energy efficiency. Each soldier is important in their ability to care for persons who are younger  and to show them the way into the future. I ask  to show true courage in responsible manner so you may be the men you wish to be. Drugs are not the answer only chaos does this create.

Respecting themselves earning good pay while house rentals and condos are presenting themselves as true cribs to assist eliminating baby mama drama  and    jail house crime. Retreat to education and possibilities and understand your importance to your elders as our new shining stars. Families are important and you need to heed the call. The cemeteries are filling with needless pain. Hold on to your mamas  they may not be there next game. Your babies  deserve more and you need to be the man...

Now, heres where i  run into a problem..i have moved on to another relationship and i am with a man in the military who i love with all my heart. he is planning on going active duty ASAP. his chances of staying in Ohio going active duty are slim to none anymore. i plan on moving with him when he goes while taking care of my divorce. my question is, will i have to get permission to take my son out of state from his father who never sees him and doesn't have visitations, or can i do as i please because i have full custody of my son without his permission?      thank you for your help and taking time to read my long story.

20090304131506AA4phua	Politics & Government;Military	How can a soldier on state orders not be entitled to Subsistence Allowance?	My husband is on his second deployment, this time to Afghanistan, a year ago he was in Kosovo.  For this deployment he was attached to and engineer battalion, he is a medic.  Anyway...this deployment is different from the last in that he was on federal orders from the beginning of pre deployment training last time so everything regarding pay went thru the federal red tape and therefore less mess ups.  This time he was on state (virginia) orders for much of his pre-mob training and towards the end of the training the state of Va stopped paying him (and the rest of his people) subsistance allowance.  And starting with the latest LES have started deducting what was paid to him previously to them cutting it off.  He started getting subsistance allowance again as soon as he was on federal orders.  Now they are taking his pay to repay this DEBT?!?!?!  It was my understanding whether on state or federal orders that he was entitled to Basic, BAH and Subsistance.  The federal government sees it that way and has done so for both deployments.  It is only the state who seems to think they dont have to pay soldiers.  Does anyone understand this??  Give me some insite, some way to fight this.  Emails to senator were given the routine..."This is not my area..cant help you"  largely para-phrased but pretty much the political run around.  I dont think we should have to repay something that is rightfully my husbands.  How is it that state orders can reduce a soldiers pay?

In the days right before the civil war, the pro slave senator took a cane and beat the crap out of an anti slavery senator.  That anti slavery senator was a Republican, back when Republicans represented the north and higher ideals.  Now the Republican party represents the south and the basest of all arguments; emotion over reason, passion over conviction, and demagoguery over civility.      They say that Rush does not stand for their party, yet not a one of them will confront the cancer in their ranks.  They claim par with Olberman and other liberal firebrands, but liberals are not (yet) demanding that Republicans be shot or expelled from the country.      Do you believe the Republican cries that all their talk that they want the country to fail is just 'a lie'?      Do you believe the Republicans about anything?

One of the interesting things to observe after George Bush issued his dictate to the world -- "You are with us or against us" -- was how some of those nations "with us" began to assume that their importance to and relationship with the United States was "unconditional" and that they could do virtually anything without worry of harming that relationship.   Taiwan and Israel were the two most interesting nations to watch because both suffer types of identity crises...      Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and even Bush himself complained about the ongoing expansion of settlements by Israelis in occupied territories -- but no firm penalties were applied by the US to Israel for these illegal settlements.      Barak Ravid writes that these red lines and instructions of Israel to the U.S. will be presented to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

20090304142023AAVE7Y0	Politics & Government;Politics	If you could borrow money at 0.3% interest* for 30 years to invest in some productive endeavor now, would you?	That's zero-point-three percent, not three percent.      If you could borrow at this absurdly cheap rate, don't you think you could find some investment opportunity which would earn a positive return? I mean, all you'd have to do is beat .3% annually, so wouldn't it be smart to borrow as much as you could?      If you're sane and correctly answered "yes," then shouldn't the government do so as well? Excepting the tax cut provisions, most of the spending in the stimulus bill has an ROI far in excess of the nearly non-existent cost of borrowing right now.       * Figures are expressed in real terms. To compute the real interest rate, take nominal interest rate - inflation rate. Inflation rate cited is the average over the period 1914-2007, which is 3.4% annually. Cited nominal interest rate is the yield on a 30-year US Treasury Bond as of close-of-market today, which is 3.70%.      3.7% - 3.4% = 0.3%

20090227072311AA5Xyvs	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	The right to face your accuser?	I was interested in learning the rights we have when accused of crime.  I watched CSI and was prompted by a witness on the show that was rather uncooperative, but otherwise knew his rights.      Anyway, in investigating our rights as US citizens I came across this whole bit on "the right to face your accuser". And looked into that...      Its a right given to us by the Sixth Amendment of the US Constitution.      I came across an internet forum somewhere about legal discussions.  Someone had asked why "molested children dont have to appear in court," and why witnesses in general can be protected anonymously even though the State can still prosecuted with their testimony.      Anyway... the "Best Answer" given on that website ended up being: "Its not the individual that accuses you, its the State."  Essentially, you are facing the State, as they are the accuser, not the witnesses.      However... this is my question...      The Sixth Amendment clearly states that you have a right to face the witnesses against you.  THE WITNESSES.  It makes no mention of facing your accuser... its explicitly gives the right to face the witnesses.      How is this corrupted interpretation reconciled?

20090304141026AATr6Jz	Politics & Government;Government	Can somebody please explain how taxing the rich is a good idea?	Obama is trying to raise the taxes on the rich.      Now, mind you (these are facts that were derived from IRS reports      the top 1% of tax paying Americans earned 1.79 Trillion Dollars (22.06% of total) yet they paid as a whole (the entire 1%) 408.4 Billion Dollars      The Bottom 95% of tax paying Americans earned 5.14 Trillion Dollars (63.34% of total) yet they paid as a whole (the entire 95%) 408.1 Billion Dollars      That means. 95% of Americans (the poor that Obama is not going to tax) supplied less than the 1% of Americans Obama is going to try and tax.      I have some questions      How can a group that earns 2.87 times less money than the other group, yet still pay more in taxes?      Seems to me, like the 95% need to have their taxes increased by 287% so that it is even across the board, right?      Also, mind you. That 95%, if their taxes increase and worst comes to it, they leave the country. Lets do some math      95% of the US Population = 288633408 people   1% of the US Population = 3038246.4 people      Now, if obama taxes the 1% and they leave, and avoid paying taxes the government loses ~408 billion dollars      Based on the # of americans in the 95% range, and the amount paid by that entire group you get $1413.9 per person      If obama increased the taxes on them instead, and the same # of americans left the country (1% of total = 3038246.4 people) the government loses 4.3 billion dollars      4.3 billion dollars >> 408.4 billion dollars      and mind you the 1% already pays 2.87 times more in taxes than the 95% as a whole.      I know the what 95% of the population voting for a man is going to overwhelm the 1% voting for the other, so obviously the 95% wont care, because they aren't getting the short end of the stick      but what if them voting for obama, causes the percentage of Americans that actually mean something to the country leaves, or lays of workers to cover the taxes..         Somebody make this make sense to me please.   Is it really just the poor overwhelming the rich in votes, so now the rich have to pay even more? Since when did it become ok to pick on the minority? Give the minority scholarships yet take away from another minority so long as its accepted by the majority?   What if the minority says screw it, and leaves for a prospering country? We all know they have hte money and power to do it?      Will America remain free, if it watched the only group of Americans that could actually affect the country leave? Or will the military force them to stay, just like Germany did to Fritz Haber. Who mind you, became a war criminal because he was forced by Germany to make poisonous gas.      How can increasing the taxes on the group that already pays more in taxes fair?      I say increase the taxes on the other 95% by 287% and then go from there. Enough with the "I am poor its not fair i didn't go to Harvard and I'm not smart"

To sum it up, prior to my maternity leave we made a verbal agreement for me to work part time upon my return from leave. Two weeks before I was due back to work I got a call saying they need me back full time.  I already made arrangements for a part time babysitter and didn't have a full time babysitter.     I asked if I could get two weeks to look for a daycare and she said ok.  in those two weeks I couldn't find any daycares that had immediate openings and asked to take the two weeks of my accrued vacation at which point I was told ok but that my job isn't guaranteed.      I wrote another email keeping her up to date with my daycare search and received no response back.       Then all of a sudden I received an email stating that they found someone else that they are hiring permanently and that they would like my last day to be Friday (two days from then).        Then she called me and left a voicemail requesting a resignation letter in order to give me a good reference.  My husband and I met with her and she again requested a resignation letter and so I agreed.  I wanted a good reference for my future job and had no idea that it was going to interfere with my unemployment.      The voicemails have been deleted form my phone somehow after 3 months and all I have is an email where she is letting me go and teling me when my last day will be.      What other information will I need?      Any suggestions?

I have never heard of someone getting pulled simply because of not wearing a seat belt. I've only heard of being pulled for speeding AND THEN getting a seat belt ticket. Or pulled for running a light AND THEN getting a seat belt ticket. I just thought it was odd. I never knew it was a primary offense in NC, if it is. I can't find information about it online, is why I'm asking here.

The state of Pennsylvania only issues new licenses every 4 years. Therefore, if you get the first at 16, you get new ones at 20 and 24.  This leaves 3 years where you are of legal age, yet have a vertical ID.  Ohio issues a new ID at 21, so anyone with a vertical ID is under age.  Bars in Columbus have begun refusing to serve ANYONE with a vertical ID.  Wouldn't this be discrimination against people from states that do not issue new licenses?  I understand the caution, but don't they need to look a little past their own borders and realize that there are other states out there? I have been told that because they feel they are protecting their liquor licenses it's fine, but they aren't even trying to find out what's correct outside their area.

Listen to him talk about "Barack the magic Negroe"then you will understand this clown a little better. Plus he was a and is a GOP kiss-up. His lips were glued on the former Presidents behind. And he bashed President Clinton to no end. But what's even worse he's a horrible talk show host. He doesn't even really follow current events. He's like a leech.

20090304150152AAeOIlQ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Please someone read. Its really important.. take the time. (any lawyers out there?)?	So heres the deal. My cousin got married about 4 years ago and found out his wife had been cheating on him about 6 months ago. He filed for divorce but his wife changed her mind and wanted to get back together with him. When he said no, she got mad and took him to court over custody of their two children for revenge (she admitted this). My cousin has very little money and just lost his job though so he could not pay for a lawyer and ended up representing himself. His wife, on the other hand has two very rich uncles who financed her. Because of this, she ended up winning custody over the children and my cousin isn't even allowed to see them. Now he's jobless, losing his house, divorced his wife and spent even penny he had trying to recieve custody over his children. He's extremly depressed and just wants his kids. Does anyone have ANY ideas on what he can do to get them back? Please!

20090227072124AARqnxQ	Politics & Government;Immigration	UK Marriage Visa Preparation?	Hi. I’m getting married this summer to a foreign national and just want to ask people that have done it before what the process is like and what evidence to prove our relationship is genuine is needed?      I’m thinking:   - Testimonies from family and professional people.   - Phone records.   - Pictures of us and of the wedding.   - Any letters or cards.   - Bank statements of family and myself showing we can support ourselves.   Anything else that I’ve missed?      Our plan is to get married out of the UK then eventually go t the UK embassy to begin the application. Is this the best way as we don’t really want to have to use a lawyer?      Also, because we are quite young, both 22, and I’m still in Uni we won’t be living together straight away in till we find a apartment. Are we going to need to show the Gov a place where we can move into right away? She does have family that she can stay with till we find the right place.      Also, what are the general costs involved for the application? And probability that it will succeed?   I mean we have been together for 4 years and have can easily prove our relationship is real, so can they really keep a husband and wife away from each other by declining it?         A lot of questions i know. Thanks, E

Do you feel it had more rhetoric than substance, or the other way around?      I was amazed at the constant stand-up applause he received - were you?      Do you feel, that at such an early time in his reign, such applause was genuine?      Are we placing too much expectations on this poor, SINGULAR leader?      I don't believe it is up to just him and his staff to work miracles or reverse what was done before him...How do you think we as a people,   may help our nation and this man, who I truly believe has the good of the country in mind?

20090227073514AAs5lBq	Politics & Government;Military	BCT/AIT scheduling question?	So, as I've stated in previous questions, I am going to join the National Guard, probably in the medical field.   But my parents are dead-set on me going to college this fall, which is fine with me.  However this presents a problem:   Even if I ship out to Basic the week after I graduate high school, there's only 12 weeks before the first day of college.  So that's plenty of time for Basic, but no time for AIT before school starts.   So my question is this: do you know if the Guard would let me do Basic this summer, drill during the school year, and do AIT next summer?  (I know some of you will tell me to speak with my recruiter, which I'm doing next week, but I wanted to get a general idea of things first.)  I know that in the Split Training Option you can do that, but you're supposed to do that your junior/senior year of highschool, and I'm a senior, so.   Thank you so much for your help.

20090227074341AAFyNpl	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	U.K. / Euro / Canadian inhabitants of the civilized world: Do you approve of socialized healthcare?	(I have asked this question before – I am attempting to pile up a large cross-section of responses – please feel free to comment even if you have already done so previously)      I argue with U.S. compatriots on a nearly daily basis over socialized healthcare versus profit-oriented-private-enterprise healthcare (Egads! The phrase alone sends shivers down my spine.) For those of you without the benefit of direct experience, profit-oriented-private-enterprise healthcare is the healthcare system in which a private enterprise with a profit motive determines the care and treatment of the patient, ‘haggling’ with doctors over diagnoses and treatment, and weighing profit and loss against the value of the patient’s life, which quite frequently results in death from routinely curable maladies untreated (at an estimated current annual average rate of over 10,000). The first socially conditioned thought-terminating cliché most Americans recite is, “I don’t want the government assigning my doctor!” to which I always respond, “Right! -because private enterprise assigning your doctor, haggling down your treatment, or prohibiting treatment altogether, and subsequent death of routinely curable malady untreated is philosophically so much more palatable!” Believe it or not, that argument by all appearance never changes the mind of the average American. Not that I expect it will ever aid me in any argument with any American, but for my own entertainment value, please express your overall approval or disapproval of socialized healthcare and perhaps address one or both of these popular superstitions:      (1) Under socialized healthcare, the government ‘assigns’ doctors, and meddles in diagnosis and treatment.      (2) Under socialized healthcare, service is inefficient and quality is deficient.      Please help an ignorant ugly American overcome the mass communications information blackout with honest responses from average real people.

20090227072936AAmHP51	Politics & Government;Politics	Isn't it time to move on?!?	I just watched a clip where the anchor made a comment relating to the last administration. I can't believe it. Has it become such a habit or trend to bash the bush administration that even now, as Washington has moved on and the Obama administration is working toward the future, we as a society cannot control ourselves from Bush bashing? Obama's campaign slogan was "change we need" and now that the change has been made most yearn for the days when they could openly voice their opinions on how bad of a job the boss is doing. Even to the extent that they can't control it! Sure bush didn't make the right choices, but we should say "Hey, we got a new administration. Let's not waste energy looking into the past but focus on the future." Is everyone so wrapped up in bush bashing that even now, as the man has no executive power anymore, and is re-relegated to the life of a normal everyday Joe Schmo, they can't bring themselves to stop?!? At this pace the economy will never be fixed. We as a society are more concerned with pointing fingers then fixing the problems!
