20090219225225AALD87a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	All 36+ pregnant women, do you feel like you can't even walk sometimes at night?	I've been having braxton hicks in the last weeks, which the doctor say it's ok, but at night (mostly) I find very uncomfortable to get off the bed to go to the restroom, which is every hour or so, and sometimes I feels like I'm not even able to walk because I feel sooo much pressure "down there"!! Do you feel like this?
20090219225405AAuXWeN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I think I am pregnant?	Hi again. I posted about how I took a test and I thought it was defective.      Anyways, my symptoms are feeling nauseated, need to sleep more, having to go to the bathroom more, slight discomfort in my lower region and also a very very faint blue line in my pregnancy test, meant it was positive.       I had intercourse with my love today and when I went to get dressed again, I looked down at my underwear and there was light brown mark or discharge. Is that normal? Should I go tested and confirm being pregnant?

20090219225618AAWbTgM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My daughter is 9 months and I am going crazy!?	So my daughter is 9 months old. She has suddenly decided she HATES sleeping, she fights her naps with a vengence, she wont take her pacifier or even drink a bottle if she is tired because it might make her sleepier. She will scream bloody murder if you do anything that she associates with sleep. On top of that I can't set her down for a second without her throwing a fit, she acts like she is mortally wounded if I do. and If I leave the room, god help us all... she has a complete emotional breakdown, or that is what she would like you to believe. My hubby tries to let me get an extra hour of sleep in the mornings, but All I here is mamamamamama or I wan mamamama. Has this happened to any of you? Any suggestions? I am not able to get anything done during the day, my nerves are frazzled. I hate the  cryitout idea, but have had to let her cry so I can eat, wash her bottles, make dinner, but she gets unbelievably upset and it seems like it makes the rest of the day even worse. HELP!
20090219225647AAqJzha	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question about common infant cold..?	my six month old daughter came down with a cough within the last week. we've used the hot steamy shower for her nose and also i bought her the baby vicks plug in, baby vicks vapor rub for her chest and i even also bought a humidifer. she never once had a fever and never once had a problem with feeding or anything like that. her attitude never changed as well. she's a very happy, loves to be on the go child and scoots around her room like nothings wrong. her cough is much better then it was in the beginning. before it was an all day all night cough kinda gagging on the phlemb that was running down the back of her throat but theres no more of that. the only time you hear her cough is normally right before she goes to bed its almost like she has a dry throat and just needs something extremely cold to cure it. so i give her a few sips of water and she loves it. although we just found out two of her cousin who lives in our house have bronchitis.    one is three years old and the other is 12 hours younger then she is. but the six month old looks extremely sick, pink eyes, cant sleep or eat well, completely opposite of my child. and now her father just left to go to the emergency room with a 102 temp (possibly the flu, but were not to sure) do you think she might have bronchitis like her cousins or no? i mean she is in no discomfort what so ever.      or can she be extremely sick and not show it at all? what is my best bet. give it a few more days, or call and see the doctor tomorrow asap.
20090219231504AABdlEe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	IF your water breaks?	Do you automatically head to the hospital?  Or do you wait?  I woke up damp and the fluid does not seem to be coming from anyone else but my vaginal canal.  Im wearing a pad to check it.  The fluid is clear but does not have a smell.  I read that amniotic fluid has a bleachy or sweet smell.   Is it bad to wait and see?  Im sitting still and I know if I stand up and have a gush its my waters.  But Im a little freaked right now and do not want to get my son up if I don't need too.  So advice please.  And don't just write go to the hospital bc that is where Im headed within the hour anyhow.
20090219230835AAEtZHs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Is wanting a black name the same as wanting an irish name?	Not the names, exactly.   But the idea.   Like, people give their kids an Irish name to honor their heritige, etc.       I mean, there are general names that people associate as being black, and others that people associate as being Irish.       I'm not being racist here, it's just when I see people saying they want a black name - people respond with extremely racist remarks.       I just want to know everyone's two cents.       Do you see it as the same idea, or with the same amout of cultural recognition??
20090219231530AAHhqbm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Any moms going through this?	My seven week old is starting to sleep longer during the nights, but I can't sleep!  After he was born, he would only sleep for two to three hours at a time so i finally got myself adjusted to his schedule (he even went through a period where he woke up every hour).        Now he can sleep for four to five hours, which i am so grateful for, but I find that i cannot sleep until 2-3 am.  He has only changed his sleep patter for the last three to four nights so i am aware that the patter can be a fluke, but if it is not, will time and patience allow me to sleep earlier?        Moms, did you go through a similar period?  If so, how long before you were able to sleep at a "normal" time as opposed to the early mornings?  Before i had my son, I normally slept between 9 pm-10 pm.

20090219230801AAPLLjr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How many ultrasounds do you get during your pregnancy?	I have had one at 9 wks 16 wks 20 wks 28 wks and im having my last one next week. I will be 32 wks. I know that most people only have 2 ultrasounds. Im pretty sure it has something to do with how many insurance will cover. The ultrasound at 28 wks was the optional 3d and i paid for it. So i guess that means that insurance will be covering 4 of my ultrasounds. They are doing the ultrasound next week to get another measurement of my baby. I thought they measured him at 20 weeks but i guess they want to do it again. Did any of you get an ultrasound late in pregnancy? If so, was it because they were worried about the babies size? Oh and for those of you that have state insurance.. i would like to know if you got one late in pregnancy too.
20090219231342AA5YC8a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why is female circumcision such an atrocity and male circumcision still ok? Both are genital mutilation.?	Both are attacks on helpless children and are attacks on their sexual organs. Women are so horrified by the thought of female genital mutilation but think that it's ok to remove healthy tissue from an infant boy because "it makes the penis look better, it makes it easier to clean, it makes urinary infections less likely.        Women who are pregnant or who may someday become pregnant need to research the possible complications of circumcision.      Complications from the procedure:       100% of all circumcisions causes loss of sexual sensation of the penis. Other complications, deformity from scaring, buried penis, blockage of the urethra, serious infection leading to cysts, loss of the head of the penis, loss of the entire penis and even death has occurred.  The deaths were attributed to the anesthesia but they wouldn't have had anesthesia if they hadn't had the unnecessary circumcision.      Don't just take my word for it and don't take your doctors word for it. Do the research for yourself and actually watch the videos of baby's being circumcised. It is a horrific, unnecessary procedure being forced on innocent babies.

20090219234713AAr2X7n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should feeding babies junk food be considered a child abuse?	When I used to be a waitress in the restaurant I would want to smack the mothers sometimes when I would see them stuffing their little babies who probably don't even have teeth yet, with french fries and ketchup. Why do mothers do that??? that is the most unhealthiest thing in the world and those babies grow up fat and addicted to junk food.       I remember the first time I've tried french fries I was 14 and thought it was the most disgusting, and oily thing ever! I ate healthy as a kid and now I eat healthy as an adult. But why do some parents abuse their children with unhealthy choices?

20090219232314AAxbIJi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I missed my period, can it just be stress?	I put this under women's health as well, so you might see this one twice.......      ok, I am now 9 days late with no signs of starting. I am married and I would love to have children, but I am going to school so we have been trying to postpone it a little bit. But like I said, I'm now 9 days late. I am on the pill and I did miss some pills this last month. But I also took a test 4 days ago and it came back as negative. I am stressed because of school, but I have never missed a period in MY LIFE, and I am not as stressed as I have been, even just 4 or 5 months ago.   So my question is: WHEN CAN I SAY THAT I AM NOT PREGNANT AND START MY PILLS AGAIN? I don't want to take them until I'm sure, when would be the best time to say that I'm sure?

I was hoping it just would not be allowed, otherwise I would have to start dealing with it now, or she is the type to just walk in with him. I know, I know, it is very strange. She is strange. Also, I am not comfortable with my family, or maybe even my husband, actually watching the baby come out, is this normal for your first pregnancy? Nor do I want to watch. Everyone is already talking about being in the room, and I pretty much just want my husband and my mom at my head and to let the doctors and nature do what they do best. Any advice?

I never raised him to be hateful to different people, I’ve always been very close to him and he and I are still close. At first he just had a big interest in World War II learning all he could about it and the Nazi movement, and I saw no problem with that. Then his father left us and he met this group of friends at school who I really don’t approve of, some of them are very involved in the Neo-Nazi organizations and have gotten him very interested in it. He recently got in a fight with a colored kid at school and was suspended for it. He said he wishes he would have lived during the 30s and 40s so he could be an SS officer. I don’t know what to do about him, he is very sweet around me but I know he lies about things he does and doesn’t act very nice when he’s out with his friends. what should I do?

20090220003738AApcBeO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why is it that most parents identify their children as intelligent, despite contradictions?	I tend to avoid children at school, and rarely associate myself with them unless out of a compulsory obligation; so I don't know them personally.  Although, it seems (judging from comments made by their parents) that they consider they children smart?  I know that parents tend to appreciate and exaggerate their child's capabilities as it fits with evolutionary psychology.  Which, ultimately creates more of an incentive to assist their child into sexual maturity allowing them to reproduce and pass on their genetic code.  Although, what is the traditional logic behind this do you think?  I personally don't think of it in terms of logic; but necessity.  Your thoughts?

As we're all sitting there watching presents being opened, my 4 year old nephew is running around the room. Yelling, jumping around, and basically being out of control, obnoxious, nasty and annoying.  My brother & sister in law, never step up and discipline him. Well, my sister in law was holding my friends 5 month old daughter when my nephew comes running through and slams his head into my friends babys head. The babys head snapped back hard and she started screaming! You know what my SIL did, she laughed! She laughed and said "oh haha, you had your first head knock." I was so freakin ticked. The baby kept rubbing the spot and crying the rest of the night. And SIL kept making jokes and laughing. Not a single freaking word was said to the kid. It's been 3 hours, and my friends daughter still has a big red knot on the side of her head.       I cant stand my SIL and want to strangle the life out of her! What is wrong with her, and why do parents act this way? Cant they see that their child is obnoxious? Why would they want to have people dislike or not want to be around their kid?

I don't have my doctors appt. until March 6th and I don't know how much more of this I can take. I don't know if it's the constant stressing out about the baby or what? Can someone help?

My friend has a 3 year old boy, who can't talk, won't look at you when you talk to him, the only words I've heard him say are "Bah bah". Doesnt look at you when you call him.

20090219235937AANXUM5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Has this happened to any of you?	So a little while ago I was just sitting in bed typing a paper. All of a sudden I got this sharp pain like when you get AF but o my gosh horribly worse and it lasted for 5 min. To the point where I just shut my laptop off and laid down. I then just all of a sudden became very warm so warm I changed into shorts and a tank top which well is weird because I live in WI then 15 min later I was ice cold. I know it is quite unlikely of this happening because my period ended on tuesday and BD on that night and haven't since, I have also noticed I have been more tired and have these weird "twinges" in my abdomen ish area, nausea's and the weirdest of them all is lately I have been craving now this has only been within the last two days graham crackers with chocolate frosting on them don't ask me why I just am. Me and my boyfriend are ttc. I know the chances of getting pregnant the same day your period ends is slim to none but my body just feels so "different". I guess its hard to explain I was just wondering if there was anyone who had symptoms like that or got pregnant that early on? Thanks! Good Luck to all!
20090220002119AAupjUq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How often does/did your 5 week old eat?	My son turned 5 weeks on Wednesday, and eats about every 2 hours. He sleeps for a maximum of 4 hours at a time, but that's a definitely maximum - haha. I'm just wondering when the gap starts to increase? I'm just glad we co-sleep and I'm breastfeeding with those short breaks! :) Oh, and one more question: my son seems to cough during each feeding, like he's getting too much milk? He was just recently weaned off of a nipple shield about 10 days ago, do you think it has something to do with that, or something else?
20090220001531AADf7WU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Boundaries for a 12 year old.?	I have a 12 year old son and I am a bit worried. I think I am in the same boat as a lot of parents but I really don't know what to do. We recently moved from a nice neighborhood to a downtown neighborhood our home is surrounded by busy streets vs. the old avenues of our previous house. He does well at school and is in band, and tries hard to be a good kid, but I worry about him falling in with the wrong crowds.        He's been going through emotional changes (the doc said it's puberty )    and gets a little mouthy sometimes. which ends up with me tightning the reigns a bit. The problem is the more I tighten the worse he gets, I know he needs some freedom to blow off steam so what kind of boundaries are good for his age? I mean do parents let their kids walk 4 blocks to a friends or ride their bike a mile?  How (besides talking , we do that) can I find out more about his friends, I see all this stuff about girls getting pregnant and I don't want my son to getting a girl pregnant. I want him to enjoy his youth but I'm awfully afraid to let go...I also just don't know how, he's my oldest and it's just very awkward. Help?

20090220000023AAxSaMT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What is the best stroller side by side stroller for newborn and 18 month old?	I am expecting in May and need a double stroller.  I am torn between a Peg Perego Aria and the Zooper Tango?  I currently have a single Aria for my older son and he loves it because of the unique harness system.   My main reason for choosing the 2 strollers above is the weight.  I am very petite and need a lightweight stroller to use.      Also does anyone know if the Graco infant seat will fit in one of the seats in the Aria Twin 50/50?  I know it is not recommended by the manufacturer but I have heard some parents have done it and it seems to work.  I would rather get the 50/50 than the 60/40.....that way both kids can have equal space when they get a little older.  Just need you input????  Thanks.
20090220000614AAqJBxr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	High in iron foods that a preschool would eat?	ok my four year old just had to have some blood work done and according to the results he has low iron.  he is not a very good eating.  really picky and won't sit still long enough to eat a whole meal.  i use to try and force him to eat.  i would not let him done from the table til he eat most of what was on his plate.  but people were always telling me that i can't force him to eat.  that he will eat when he is hungry so i now let him know it is time to eat and he comes to the table sits down and plays with his food.  some meals he hardly takes a bit others he eats eveything.  i always try to fix just what he likes so that i have a better chance of him eating.  so he is really small in weight only the 5%.  so my question is is there any foods that are high in iron that i could maybe get him to eat.  the doctor told me clams.  come on a four year old eating clams.  get real.  but i am seriously at the end of my rope.  i just don't know what else to do.  it makes me feel like a failure as a mother.  so any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

More than once or twice a day. But I also do escorting everyday, and ALWAYS use a condom. And all times, the condoms never broke.

I know that it's highly likely that my boyfriend is the father, but I still want your opinions please. I was even thinking about a prenatal paternity test just to be sure, but don't want to result to one because it's a high risk procedure. Thanks!

But.. my question is.. if I start going into labor.. will I be able to tell the difference between this pain and labor pains? I'm scared I won't be able to tell the difference. Please help!

I understand the pros and cons of travel systems and am wondering if anyone can recommend a specific model that they liked. I have heard good and bad reports on the durability of Gracos and the models I looked at in the store seem to relay on a single plastic clip to hold the infant seat on the stroller.  Pushing on the back of those infant seats tipped them easily.  The Eddie Bauer adventure travel system had the clip in addition to a metal bar near the feet and seemed to hold the infant seat much better.  I also liked that E.B. had metal buckles instead of plastic.  Any thoughts or suggestions? I plan on having more children so I need something that will last.

20070619005253AAfQQdN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I pregnant? I had both ept and first response?	This morning i woke up and peed on the e.p.t  on my first urine, which i waited for about 3 minutes for the result; and it came out negative at that time.       Later on the day, i took a trip to napa valley and had about 6-7 different tastes of wines. By the time i got home around 10 pm, I noticed that the test had become positive. The type of ept that i have has 2 windows, one has only one line and the other one would show a + sign for positive. So, when i came home, the positive had appeared; however, one line is clearly much lighter than the other line yet you can still tell its a +.    So my bf and I went to grab another pregnancy test with first response, and it came out negative with a very clear one pink line. But over the other discussions, it could be the effect of not a morning urine.    Can someone please help me out here? Would the wine tastings affect my result of the pregnancty test? Or is the negative result was simply because it was not my first urine?   *iPeed 4 times 2day

I'm 20 weeks pregnant and for the past week and a half, I've felt the baby move on a regular basis. He's been very active with strong kicks and jabs in my lower abdomen and when he does wake up, he moves around for a decent length of time, however for the past few days I've been sick with a stomach virus and yesterday morning I took a Phenergan pill to help with my nausea/vomiting and he hasn't moved much ever since. The only movements I feel are very small compared to how active he was being. It just feels like he is barely moving at all and not as much. Is the change in his activity level something I should be concerned about or is this normal? Could the stomach virus/Phenergan have affected him in some way?

20090203114221AAfMozi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	A question about domestic violence protection orders...?	I put this in parenting simply because its got to do with my daughter's father, and its the parenting issue that has caused the problem.  My daughter's father is a nut.  Most of you have probably read previous questions or answers I have made regarding him.  Well, I did something dumb.  I allowed him to see my daughter (after 7 months of him not showing up) because I felt like it was the right thing to do.  I felt I should give him one last chance after so long to see if he had changed.  At first it seemed he had changed.  He has been claiming that he found God and such, and at first I believed it.  He went days without cussing, he prayed before meals, and he was just as nice as could be.  He came over here (his mom brought him because he has no license due to DWI) and my daughter had no idea who he was.  Shortly after though, she warmed up to him and his mother.  His mother left, and it was just us 3.  He offered to buy us dinner, so we went out.  Everything was more than perfect, and I was beginning to wonder if I had made a mistake by keeping him away.  (Of course, all of the horrible things he has done slipped my mind) We came back, gave her a bath, and put her to bed.  We then sat down to talk.  He started off on his "I wanna be a family" deal, and I was quick to tell him that we don't need him, and that if he was looking for me to beg him to take me back he wasn't going to get it.  He kept on about it, and so forth.  I did cry a little, only because the whole situation is still very fresh and it bothers me how things have been.  Well, he left and I assumed everything was ok with us.  Well I was apparently wrong.  He went back to his girlfriend (whom he sat here and told me he hated and he wanted to leave her) and told her that I had spent the whole night begging him to take me back.  That I cried my eyes out because he told me that he didn't want me, he wanted her.  (Funny, since I only shed a few tears, and by no means "cried my eyes out".) Once I heard this, I immediately told the girl that this was BS, and that he was trying to cheat on her again.  (This isn't the first time he has pulled this stunt).  She said that his mother told him that I was a liar, and that all I was doing was trying to break them up, that she SAW and HEARD everything and that he wasn't lying.  Also funny, because she wasn't even HERE.  They are both telling the girl that she never left us alone.  Now he is texting me saying that I'm a drama queen, and that I ruined his life!  Again threatening that this girl will be my daughter's stepmother and blah blah blah.  Acting like a little child.  The most important thing is, that all this is really disrupting my daily life.  It keeps me on edge, and keeps my nerves torn up.  Its basically made me a nervous wreck.      My question is, could this emotional abuse be enough to get a protective order against him?     P.S- I have learned my lesson this time, and do not plan on every letting him see my daughter again, unless there is an officer at my door serving papers.

20090203113424AAHxu6Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Family Vacations-Where do you like to go?	I was just thinking that it has been sooo long since my husband and I have taken a trip that wasn't to visit family.  Unfortunately both sets of grandparents live either 300 miles away or 750 miles away, so it takes a big deal to visit them, and we like to do so at least once a year.  This leaves little time or money for other vacations.    What is it like for you and your family?  How many vacations are spent visiting family vs. just for fun/destination trips?    Where have you taken your family and where do you hope to go to?

20090203115438AAL2VO6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do you think many peoples opinions about TEENAGE PREGNANCY  is based of what they see on T.V.?	& statistics ? Why are so many people so judgmental about something they don't know about (most of them).   I mean Ive seen horrifying stuff on T.V. Where a fifteen year old was trying to get pregnant since she was 14 and then ordered    fertility drugs off the internet (Not prescribed by doctor) & now she is trying to get married to her old camp consuler that use to date her sister .lol   Yea , If you believe that all teenager girls that are pregnant , their must be something wrong you. Also all the statistic that the mother will beat the child or    the father always leaves isn't always true .          You judgmental people can say whatever you want on here , because you know why .Ive heard it all .   "Teenagers can't get good paying jobs" "The grandparents are going to raise the child" "You're to immature" "Stay in school and get an education"   The list goes on ...and on .         ----------------------------------   Oh and what about me? Yes , im pregnant 16 year old . Im in school I have all A's & B's .I take online school so I can get a grade ahead too .   Ive been trying to get a job even before I was pregnant nobody is hiring (I live in a small town) .Thank god my boyfriend has a job . Im not going to claim to be mature    because that just makes me sound immature . I didn't get pregnant on purpose , and im not getting married just because im pregnant . My boyfriend is the most amazing guy on the Earth Ive never met such a genuine person .He's my bestfriend & everything.I don't need to be married because in a few years from now when im older ...when My boyfriend And I are still together we can get married . You can say to me you shouldn't have had sex in the first place ,and mabey you're right , but it happend and Now im doing everything I can, taking responsibilty For my actions . I would never get an abortion , and I am not ever giving my child up for adoption . I don't call that being selfish If I don't ...I think that If you give your child away ..That's pretty damn selfish .

20090203114904AAqK3UA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Prejudice and support around adoption stereo types and issues in surprising places?	So, as I venture deeper and deeper into the adoption journey with our family, several things stand out for me. One, is that each adoption has such intense feelings associated with it and are all very different from one another.  Second, hardly anyone is the general community at large knows anything about adoption, adoption issues, the types of adoptions out there. Can the community share constructive stories about surprising areas of ignorance (schools, families, neighbors, doctors offices etc) and areas of support that surprised them?  What did you do in response to either one?      I had two stories--one family member who said she hoped I wasn't adopting "one of those ghetto babies" which shocked me of course.  It was a big clue that prompted me to dig in and do some research about what was going on in the world at large on adoptions. And then another good story where my 82 YO grandmother called me with an extremely open mind and asked questions rather than go off of any assumptions.  She and my grandfather had adopted a really long time ago and never told my aunt and it had horrible implications later on.  She really and sincerely wanted to talk about it and talk about what they would have done different if they would have known better. I about fell over in my chair on that one too.

20090203114919AAcNZjP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What Do You Think Of These Baby Girl Names?	First off I am NOT pregnant and secondly these aren't a bunch of my favourite names, they're just some random ones that I thought. I don't necessarily like all of them, but I'm just curious as to see what you're taste in names are. There are a variety - girl names and unisex names, though I might not necessarily agree with all of them. They're just a random bunch - as I said - which, hopefully will give a bit of variety in answers. Here are the names:      Felicia    Kyra    Logan   Rhianna   Morgan   Freela   Rose   Blaire   Jordan   Michaela   Hailey   Cameron   Courtney   Levanya   Quinn      I wil give my opinion on the names before I choose the best answer. Also the more detailed the answer, the more likely you are to get Best Answer, however you can do it whatever way you want.       G2B

After 2 mc's I have been TTC again this month.    All I went off was my 28 day ish cycle and an ovulation calculator that said I was most fertile 23 - 28th Jan.    Had sex 22/23/24 and had ewcm (lots of) on sunday 25th and ewcm but less of it on 26/27th.  I didnt get to have sex other than those dates as bf had the flu.    I thought due to this I probably missed the mark, however I have sore boobs on and off for the last 3 days, and mild cramping which today has got stronger. Most importantly I have a dull lower back ache that I have only ever had when I was pregnant.     AF due 7th/8th Feb, but I couldnt wait and knowing it was too sonn I have taken a test anyway which was BFN, but it is prob too early and wasn't with FMU.

20090203115700AAzS8bU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What should I do with my son's hobbies and lifestyle?	My son (15) lives with his mother and I see him once or twice a month. I see how my wife has influenced him to become the way he is. Instead of football, basket or hunting, he is taking classical singing lessons. When he was younger I took him out to ball games and I often took him out hunting. When I ask him why he isn't interested in sports now he tells me that "he just hasn't got any interest". He told me he had been performing at his school and that he wanted to do something in the future with his singing. He actually sang for me in my house. He was good and he could sing high notes, but I think his voice was way too high for a man. I told him he sounded like a castrato. I am used to guys with lower voices. I am worried that he will become a castrato if he doesn't stop singing. He also talks in a high voice. I don't want him becoming gay. Other interests he has got are writing poetry, stargazing and Harry Potter. Why can't he have more male interests like sports, hunting or computers?   I talked with my ex-wife yesterday and she got angry in me for calling my son a "castrato". Why shouldn't I worry? Is singing too much dangerous for a man during puberty?   And my son has diabetes 1. He is eating loads of sweets. Why can't he control his diet more instead of using insulin?

But it was very strange and light, lasted 2 maybe 3 days which was not right at all. After that I have been having lower back/hip aches, feeling sore and weird twinges on both my right and left side ovaries, really really tired, and sensitive nipples, also very EMO! (this has been going on since jan. 10th). Today I had a cup of coffee to keep me awake at 9 am but I'm still terribly tired. I can't keep my eyes open. I would be around 6-7 weeks right now if I were really prego right? What do you think.. I know I should test, but I'm sick of wasting money on tests if my AF comes in a couple of days. This really sucks.. wish we could tell easily. All AF and pregnancy symptoms are almost alike! Any advice or opinion would be nice.. I will probably test at the end of the week.

When he was 3 I placed him in day care and he has been very difficult for teachers and staff every place I took him to. He is polite at home and has managable, average behavior for his age. At school he is a total different child, i sometimes in shocked at what the teachers say he does! I refuse to put him on medication or have him labeled with a disorder. I really would like resources if anyone knows of any to help build his self esteem and make him more positive about himself. He tells me he acts "Crazy" for his friends, it is just damaging him socially and his teachers really hate it.

20090203113809AABDsZS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Should husband take 15 mos old out of state to visit grandparents against overprotective mommy's will?	My husband and I have been married two years and have a fifteen month old son together and a 10 year old daughter (his from previous marriage).  He wants to visit his parents in another state during the 10 yr old's spring break in March.  I am unable to get the time off work because we already have plans to visit them in August and at Christmas and I am taking time off for those trips.  I think at just over 1 yr old, my son is too little to be away from mommy and out of his element for a week and I dont want my husband to take my son without me.  My husband thinks I am being totally irrational.  I think I am doing what is best for my son at his young age.  Either way, he intends to take him on the trip regardless and is telling me I can't do anything about it.  Which is probably true but totally out of line, if one parent says no shouldn't the other parent respect their wishes?
20090203114013AAbDO6m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Does he have pink eye?	On sunday my son(5yrs old) was complaining that he didn't feel good. So when we got home we put him in bed to rest and he woke up with a fever of 101.2. So I figured it was just a typical cold or virus that he got from school.      He had a rough night that night but seemed a lot better on Monday. Then today he was okay in the morning but I noticed some greenish stuff coming out of the corner of his left eye. I had him go wipe it off and thought nothing of it because he gets what we call "eye boogies" all the time.  So I assumed it was that.  Well, he took a little nap because I could see he wasn't feeling good again and after about an hr he came out and when I looked at him it looked like someone punched him in the face or something. He eye was very red and watery and a lot more green stuff coming out of the corner. He has a fever of about 101 again and he just seems miserable. And his mucus is like a yellowish  green. Sorry to be so gross about it but I know that means some sort of infection.    I had pink eye when I was younger but I don't really remember it too much. Do you get a fever and everythinglike that with pink eye? Or maybe it is a sinus infection??       We are taking him to the doctor today I just want to see if anyone had the same problem and knew what it was.      Thanks!!

I currently work part time, and am looking to stay at home full time with my 11 month old daughter. A friend of mine asked if I would be interested in keeping her 5 year old daughter during the summer, full time 5 days per week. I think this would be a great opportunity because I could be at home full time with my daughter also. My friend asked me to let her know what I would charge, but I have NO IDEA! I have never worked as a nanny before. She would bring her daughter to my house early in the morning and then pick her up around 6 or so (there may be some night meetings also). What should I tell her?

That I want to be with her forever, marry her, the whole lot?      I try to tell her this, but she ignores it and asks questions about my ex wives and kids.       I'm scared she'll terminate, I don't know what to do.

20081113162756AAsWCBs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Christmas Gifts for Daycare Center Caregivers? 10pts!!!!?	Okay, so as you can tell from my answers, I'm a single mom with a 16 almost 17 month old daughter who attends daycare while mommy works full-time.      Christmas is coming up and I'm not sure what to get these lovely ladies who care for my child. She doesn't have one dedicated caregiver but 6 who watch/float 20 toddlers divided between 2 rooms. They are all amazing women and do so great with her, they've even been trained (by me) to give her breathing treatments when having issues with her asthma. They also stay on top of the asthma while at school, contacting me right away and starting emergency medication ( all outlined by me) if needed.      I also need something for the 9 other kids in her room. Each holiday parents make gift bags for the kids, sometimes an age appropriate toy, socks, snacks, little stuff, but very cutely done. Any ideas?      The budget: Being a single income family of two with no child support, I can only spend $100 for the group.      THE RULES: No nasty comments about how it isn't enough. I've asked around with other parents in her class have given i nthe past, they've said mini-lotions, and brought baked goods, flowers, etc. I've also been told by a few that they don't expect much more than that. I've also seen where people think nannies/home daycares/daycare centers "deserve" a full week's pay or equivilent for "raising" your child. Give me a break. I love them, I appreciate them, I tell them constantly how wonderful they are, but I can't afford that and it seems a bit excessive.      Seeing how they all get lotion EVERY year, I don't want to gothat route...

20081104081738AAh8pzu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Child support question?	I'm considering if I even want to open this can of worms with the father to be. He hasn't been there, says he will once baby comes but I don't believe him... He drinks a lot, smokes weed, other things I don't want my son around EVER, and NEVER keeps his word about anything. I always have had to make the first contact move, he never checks on how his son is doing, never comes to dr appointments. (I found out all of this later, after I knew I was pregnant. We weren't in a relationship.) My extended family is being very supportive and helping me way more than I ever thought possible, and my parents are excited about their first grandchild (upset with how he came about but.... oh well). My dad even said that he was gonna sleep in their room lol.      Anyway, I doubt I need his help financially, as my family is very independent and stubborn to do things alone (in general, not just child support issues). However, it would be helpful, especially later for college, etc. But! I don't think I'll ever see a dime.      What do you think? Attempt to get it, or just leave him alone?
20081109013945AAowO70	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think of these names for future kids?	I'm not pregnant, but I do want around 4 kids in the future. It would be ideal to have either 4 girls, or 2 girls and 2 boys, but obviously I won't be able to control that :) Anyway, I want to know what you think of these names, and how you would rate them on a scale of 1 - 10.      GIRLS:      --Evangeline Leah Cristina: Evangeline came from a little anti-racist girl in the 1800's in the book Uncle Tom's Cabin. Leah Cristina is the name of my older sister. Nickname for Evangeline: Eva.      --Caroline Angela Patricia: Caroline came from the song "Sweet Caroline", which I love, by Neil Diamond. Angela Patricia is my oldest sister's name. Nickname for Caroline: Cara (Carrie has bad connections in my family, and I don't prefer Carol)      --Shelby Karen Ann: Shelby is the name of my cousin and the town I used to live in, and one of my greatest memories is going down to Myrtle Beach, where I would collect shells. (Shell = Shelby) Karen Ann is my mother's name. Nickname for Shelby: Bee.      --Adrienne Mia Catherine: Adrienne is a name I've loved for years, and it's the name of a girl who was my friend in elementary school. Mia Catherine is the name of my two year old niece, whom I love the pieces :) Nickname for Adrienne: Addie.      BOYS:      --Mitchell Robert James: Mitchell is the name of two of my cousins from different sides of the family. Robert is my other cousin's name, and James is my brother's name. My brother's full name is James Michael, but Mitchell is a variant of Michael, so I won't use that. Nickname for Mitchell: Mitch.      --Levi Daniel Joseph: Levi is the name of a brother of a friend of my best friend, and I love the name. Daniel Joseph is the name of my oldest brother. Nickname for Levi: Lee.      --Shaden Bernard Nicholas: Shaden is the name of my little brother, his mother (my step-mom) named him that because she has a love of earthy names, and the name Shaden came from the shade of the trees. Bernard is my father's name, and Nicholas is my cousin's name. Nickname for Shaden: Shay.      --Dustin Michael Anthony: Dustin was the name of a friend of my brother, who got injured and lost his eye in an outside accident. Michael is the middle name of my brother James, and it is also the name of my uncle. Anthony is my broher-in-law's name. Nickname for Dustin: Dusty.      So I just wanted to know what your favorites are, how you would rate each of the names 1 - 10, if you think all of the girls names go together, and which girl names go with each boy names. Thanks a ton, please be honest, but not rude!

I haven't used veggies yet cause they are hard and im not sure how to do it, also i read that cooking veggies will drain the nutrients out of them, is that true? I don't think it is other wise most ppl wont eat them.      also, is cost a factor in why you make ur baby food?   it is about 25% why i do, a jar costs $0.67, and 2 for a dollar, and i figure that it has to be healthier some how to make your own.
