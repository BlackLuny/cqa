Im having my third c section on feb 17 but ive begun dilating and ive been having contractions but they aren't close enough to time. My doc says that they wont do my cx section before 39 weeks and not to come in unless my water breaks or my contractions are five min apart but my best friend tells me that having a scheduled c section im not supposed to go into labor or dilate, they are supposed to take the baby at like 37 weeks. Im confused and scared that im gonna have to have ANOTHER emergency c section. So the question is, are they supposed to do the c section once i begin to dilate or is waiting until 39 weeks normal?

Then they did my blood work and I got the results the other day and they said i have to have another blood test, because my blood sugar was to high and I fallowed their directions I didn't eat or drink anything after Midnight or the day of my appointment.

20090131183122AAn0Dts	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What can I do?I feel like a loser?!?	So this year Im in eighth grade, and I feel like Im such a loser.I've always told myself that by eighth grade I would have a great year.It didn't happen yet and its third quarter.I getting worried,I stay home all the time,and arent really motivated to do anything,I dont do any sports or hobbies b/c usually when Im interested in one we dont have the money b/c my parents are too busy paying for my older brothers lessons and activities(even though he has a job).Dont get me wrong, I am friendly and have in-school friends,but I just feel like nobody Ive met so far actually has really clicked with me. In my school I feel like Im just a joke,or an outcast.Im not like full-fledged weirdo, I mean Im actually probably one of the prettier girls in my school(and I dont have to wear a mask of makeup to achieve it) and I dress kind of funky(but normal).My only problem is that Im sometimes a tad shy.Also, I really dont get along with many of the girls- I mean Im not a girly-girl,prep; Im more of a tomboy if anything.Growing up,all of my neighbors near my age were guys and I hung out with them most of the time.I listen to rock music and skateboard,am not really into all the drama.Id probably make a better friend with a guy- but most guys my age are pervs/immature/shy/weird or druggies.Basically in this question Im asking how can I make more friends,while keeping my grades in check,and making the best out of the year?

But for the past 2 months he has really gotten a temper and he's not afraid to use it. I was under the impression that children didn't start tantrums until around the age of two. Is my son acting like a typical 14 month old?       When he doesn't get what he wants he gets really stiff and screams at the top of his lungs.Or if I'm trying to pick him up he kicks his legs frantically and arches his back back. My husband thinks I've just spoiled him and brought this on myself. If he gets so angry now how will it be once he's older. How can I help him to control it now before it gets out of control? He is very smart and knows a lot of words. Is he too young to understand how to use his words correctly so he can tell me how he feels or what he wants?      I don't have experience with one year olds so I'm not sure what to expect. I'm just wanting some reassurance from others that he's typical.

20090131182839AAEdOKm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What sperm is "best" for pregnancy?	The wife and I are trying to get pregnant.      We want to make the healthiest kid we can possibly make.      What sperm is "best" for pregnancy? Fresh or day(+) old?      When I ejaculate after not ejaculating for a two or three days, the semen is of course thick(ish) and concentrated with sperm. The semen becomes less concentrated with sperm each ejaculation thereafter.      Is there a qualitative difference between concentrated and less-concentrated semen in terms of (1) getting pregnant, and (2) producing the healthiest child possible?      I'm just thinking the longer my sperm is in my testicles, the more chance there is that the sperm will somehow become less viable. So my third question is whether or not there is any truth to that statement.

I would love to have a baby next year, but I know I'll get the..you are in grad school, you are too young, you JUST got married, you have no money,get a teaching job first, you have so much time, teach for a while.  There are other personal issues as well, like being on anxiety medication, etc.  Anyway, I can't shake this baby itch, but I'm worried about it not being a good time.

20090226060614AAwAbHm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it possible to pinpoint a more accurate due date rather then this approximate 2-3 week period?	I'm curious about this because there seems to be so many 'variables' used in an obstetrical office to determine a due date. Given that babies come in all sizes and shapes, determining a due date via ultrasound isn't exactly accurate.      I know the exact day of my last menstural cycle: August 15th, 2008   I know the exact day I conceived: my husband and I had a lovely romantic night on August 25th 2008, he left on business thereafter - and I swear, I knew the next day I was pregnant.      With that information, I strongly debate my due date given to me by my OB for May 28th. I understand it's their job to guesstimate, and the baby will come when they feel like it. But I can't help but feel there's a lot of loop holes in this method of calculation. For example, I went for an ultrasound when I was 21 weeks pregnant, and the technician said I was only 19.6 weeks pregnant. I know that I conceived on that exact day ...I hadn't had intercourse with my husband for quite some time before or after due to us moving. I believe it's likely and possible that I just am or was carrying a smaller then average baby.       Basically, would I be wrong in calculating it for myself as a due date of May 22-23rd?

I was thinking abt getting a wrap, especially since she isn't mobile yet at all (sometimes she'll somehow move while sitting). Do you think it's too late to get a wrap?

I don't have a problem with this because I get more sleep knowing she is ok and still breathing (first time mom can you tell?!? haha) but I'm afraid she is going to fall off and I would hate for that to happen... anyone else had this happen? any advice on what to do?!?! (btw the bassinet is directly next to me in my bed)

20090131193531AAnhiIl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	12 year old drinking from keg on myspace.?	I'm 14. My friend was looking at her myspace page, and followed a link of one of her "friends". There are pictures of 12 year old girls drinking from the keg (whatever you call it) and smoking. There are also pics of them in their underwear. It's almost like child porn, but the girls did it to themselves!  Also, there are pictures of a 15 year old drinking with her mom.  Should we... do something, like call CPS or the police, or should we not do anything and let them learn when they try to apply for a job?

Lately I have been really weak and while I was pregnant with my little guy I had to take iron pills because I was borderline anemic. I was curious if it is safe to take iron pills while breastfeeding, or if it is safe maybe every other day? Has anybody else felt really weak after baby was born is that kind of normal? Sometimes it is hard to hold my arms and head up because I am just so, well, weak. I don't want to take anything that can harm my baby and I don't want him getting overdose of iron, but if it will help me regain my strength I would like to start taking them again. Any other suggestions of things to take besides iron pills that could get my strength back up? Thanks in advanced!      He is going to be a month old this monday.

A friend of mine is leaving her abusive husband and taking her 6mon old daughter with her. We've called shelters all day and they are all full up and keep referring us to more shelters that are also all full up. She won't stay here as I live too close to her husband and our other friends live too far from her job to commute so she's decided to sleep in the car for a few weeks. It's 30 degrees out here and I don't think she should do this. She insist it's fine and there's nothing to prove it isn't. Anyone know of any books/websites that give guidelines for babies being out in cold?

20090131185801AAYvgqK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents what would you do if the store?	I ordered my son a cake for his 16 th birthday. I spent a hour explaining how the cake was suppose to be made and the person that took the order seemed unsure of himself, so I expected to receive a phone call today.  I received the phone call as expected. WE talked for about 30 mintues she recapped it over again and all was good.       WRONG! I went to pick up the cake and it was wrong, everything was wrong. It was too late to have another cake made, it is my son's 16 party, and I can't have him a party because he is in a instution so I only get to spend a few hours with him and it is all messed up.       The manager added insult to injury when he said I could take a cake that was at least two days old from the shelf, or have a 2.00 discount. The cake I bought was 25.00.    Am I wrong to be upset? How would you expect the store to fix the problem?  He ended up taking 10.00 off. rudely.       I mean I ordered a cake that was suppose to have a football field air brushed on it , with 20 cup cakes going around it In each corner it was suppose to have a helmet that had the steelers and the carnidals helments. and the cupcakes was suppose to have red and yellow icing with some football (rings) on a couple of the cupcakes just to added to the theme of it. The cupcakes were all suppose to be choc.       The cake was choc with white frosting (no football field) with two helmets on the cake drawn they were in the colors that they were suppose to be, the cupcakes were half choc and half white- they were in the yellow and red frosting- but all had football rings (for a 16 yr old party ouch!). and about 20 boys from the instution .       How can someone repeat the order back and completely screw it up so badly?      I am so upset about it. he is only going to turn 16 once and it is bad enough I only get a few hours with him.

20090131184334AATvpVx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I try co-sleeping again?	Ok, here's the situation:      My 7 month old daughter has been sleeping in her mini crib (next to my bed) for the past couple of months (occasionally sleeping with me).  We used to co-sleep full-time, but it didn't work out (she moved a lot in her sleep, started rolling ,etc).  When she sleeps occasionally in my bed, she doesn't wake up all that often, and I get a lot of sleep.      For the past couple of weeks, she has been waking up VERY frequently during the night.  Like 6-7 times!  Each time, I have to make sure she has her paci, and have to pat her back until she falls asleep again.        My sleep is SERIOUSLY disrupted, and I have turned into a walking zombie.  I can't be half-asleep during the day, because I'm a single mom and I have to take care of her.        I'm thinking about putting her back in my bed during the night, so that I can get the rest I need.  The thing is this:  I don't want her to once again develop a dependence on sleeping in my bed.  I have nightmares of my daughter being 5 years old and STILL sleeping in mommy's bed!        Any suggestions?  I'm desperate!      Thanks in advance!

My sister is divorced, and the dad of her daughter is a nutcase. She wants to send the daughter to us, and the sons to my brother in Virginia. She is 14 years old, which is Emma's age and i am sure Emma wouldn't mind since they get along so well,but i have 5 kids and i'm pregnant with a baby girl. That's 7 kids. And Christine didn't say, "Can Jordyn stay with you for a while?" It was, "I am sending Josh and Caleb to Davids and i was wondering if Jordyn can stay with you and go to high school there." And i replied, "Christie, i would love to but i have 5 kids and im pregnant and having a hard enough time going between 5 kids and trying to make a nursery for Savannah when shes born. I don't know. " and Christine says, "Well, okay good! Talk to Christopher (my husband), i will have her down there around march 1st." Okay, is she deaf?

20090226073632AArZGQq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can you be friends with someone when you don't agree with how they parent?	I went to meet a lady I met on a baby forum today.  We'd emailed and got on really well, but I was really shocked with how she behaves towards her little girl.  She is 3, and absolutely lovely.  But whenever she spoke, her mum would talk over her and ignore her, and told me to ignore her and not bother answering her when she spoke to me either (I ignored her and answered).  She openly spoke about her marriage problems in front of the little girl, and not thinking it would work out.  Then she spoke about when she found out she was pregnant, and how she debated up til 24 weeks whether to have an abortion - she used the term 'get rid of the baby' - so although the little girl is only 3, it's not difficult to understand what the woman was talking about.  Then we spoke about her husband wanting more children and she said 'i've told him I won't be making that mistake again!'.  The little girl asked if she could have a drink whilst her mum was talking and she snapped at her and said she would get a smack if she interuppted again, then said about how the little girl has been 'appalling behaved' recently and that yesterday, she spent 3 hours on the naughty step because she'd brushed her hair with her mums brush and refused to apologise for it!  I was gobsmacked.  I know the little girl probably isn't always as good as she was today, but smacking and time out over those things seem far too extreme to me.  Before anyone says it, I'm not judging.  I just don't think I would be able to stand by and watch whilst she smacked her for no reason.  Do you have friends whose parenting differs completely from your own?  Have you lost friends because of it?

20090226065958AAAuMmX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has anyone been pregnant during student teaching?	My husband and I are thinking of having our first child in the near future! I am student teaching from Aug. - Dec. 2009. We want to have our first baby born soon after, like around Feb. 2010.      Do you think it would be better to go into student teaching already 2 or 3 months pregnant? If I do, then I will have already experienced and gone through most of the "morning sickness" during my first trimester over the summer and not have to worry about throwing up in front of the kids while student teaching. By the time student teaching starts I would simply be in, or close to, my second trimester with a belly. Also, I would still be delivering after December (the month I graduate with a Bachelor's), probably by Jan. or Feb. of the next year.      Or would it be better to get pregnant during student teaching? That way I would not have a gigantic belly the entire time while student teaching. It would just be the "morning sickness" that I am worried about. And, of course, the baby would not be delivered until after graduation this way too.      I would prefer to not have any comments that suggest we not be or get pregnant while I am student teaching. Please do not suggest that. Having babies is hardly ever convenient anyway. Also, please let me know if you have or have not been pregnant while student teaching - this will help me understand why you answered the way you did.      Thanks!

20090131184842AAu6rUw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents: What clique do your kids fit into?	The cliques are:      Mean Girl   Athlete   Cheerleader   Band Kid   Brainy   Loser(non-main stream, doesn't wear "in" things, doesn't care how they look)   Popular(not an athlete or cheerleader but still with "in" group)      It can be a mix of each.          Like in high school I was a Mean Girl/Athlete/Popular.   I ran the school. I knew all the administrators. I knew all the security guards. I had no repercussions for my actions. I wiggled my way out of everything. I wanted to leave for lunch, I brought back food for the guards. I got my cell phone taken away in class, I pleaded and made up excuses till I got it back after class. The only punishment I ever served was a suspension for passing notes in class. My mom took me home and she went to work and I went got my swim suit on and layed out. I wasn't a slut though. I'll give my self that.   I would talk on my cell out in the hallway.    I swam and played rugby.       But what was/is your kid?
20090131192346AAdcIeQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Need Help with My Six Year Old?	A little over a year ago my six year olds 3 1/2 month old baby brother passed away. This was her dad's and stepmoms son. I had her in counseling for a little while and things got better. Well now she is clawing at her arm and I am getting scared. I am doing all the things the counselor suggested that I do right before she stopped counseling. One of the things is not to rush her into go back over to her dads house because it upsets her so badly, but her dad is getting mad at me. I am really at lose on how to help her. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
20090226073642AAPuVBD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Could I get custody of a friends baby?	I know it sounds crazy... but I can assure you I am not.  I have a friend who is incredibly irresponsible and raising two children.  One of them is older and has undoubtedly had more than enough attention.  The younger one, who is one year old, is left in a crib for the majority of the day in a room with the door closed, no surprise that they are slower in development and skills for the age, and he is showing MANY signs of being autistic.  The mother simply doesn't see anything wrong with this and has not taken him to a doctor for his symptoms.  It breaks my heart and my husbands as well.  I have what I refer to as a faulty uterus and want a child so badly.  Is it possible for me to gain custody of this baby?  If so, how would I go about even mentioning the subject to the mother and father of the baby?  The father treats the baby much better than the mother and spends time with him, but the mother is there most of the time and keeps him locked in a back room all day and night long.  He is fed well, but gets barely any attention, no exercise, and obviously no desperately needed medical care.  What can I do???  I love this baby so much and I am friends with the person for the sole reason to go to her house and get her son out of that room and interact with him and shower him with love.

I'm suicidal, depressed, attention-seeking, psychotic, and a creeper, and I don't know why. I've always had a good home life, no one beat or abused me. Never had any real problems with adults in general. Is it because I'm so damn quiet? I hate meeting new people, I guess I'm anti-social...is that why? Plenty of people are anti-social though, and they're not all as insane as I am...so I ask...what's wrong with me?

20090131192415AAdnAfM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy test at hospital was negative?	I went to the emergency room last night, and I was so out of it because I was feeling so sick. They put an IV in my arm and I THINK they also drew some blood right before they put the IV in. I went through a lot of tests and peed in a cup and had a pelvic exam too. Later on the doctor was talking to me and mentioned that the pregnancy test came back negative. I was relieved because for the past couple of months I have been worried about that. But now that I am back at home, I'm over analyzing everything like I always do. So my question is, did they do a urine test or a blood one?? i wasn't even thinking about it because I was so sick. I was just happy it was negative.      Do hospitals do urine pregnancy tests? I'm hoping it was a blood test, because then I KNOW I have nothing to worry about.

I have heard all kinds of stuff, in older books I have been reading and from talking to people.  If all goes well, you and the baby are healthy and all, can you go home right away?  if you have to stay overnight, does your husband stay or leave? does the baby stay with you or in the nursery?  I've never been through this and I'm nervous!!!!!  :)      OH and before I forget, who's all in the delivery room while you are in labor?  my folks and his folks are flying in and I need a tactful way to tell them they are NOT welcome in there, if they are allowed to be (both moms work in a hospital and will want to be!)...  I just don't think I'll be in the frame of mind to deal with them at that particular time...  and I think it would be awkward....  I just want the med. staff and my husband there, is that ok?  thanks!

I've read that during ovulation or right before you get the heavy mucus and when it's dry you're pretty much done ovulating. Does it seem like I'm done ovulating? With my regular cycle I should be starting my period sometime the end of next week. The first time I got pregnant on the second try (didn't even know about the certain time of month to conceive) and actually took the first response test 5 days before my missed period and got a very faint line. Just wondering if you think I could try a test sometime the middle of next week and it would detect it.

20090131192033AA09spH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How can I do this... without making someone upset? (Please help me. Prefer parents)?	Okay, I'll start out with some background information. I'm 14, in 8th grade. The majority of my friends are freshman, 14 and 15. Because of this, I don't get to see them much at school events (middle & high are separated). My boyfriend is a freshman, 14 years old as well. He is about 4 months older than I am, but because the cutoff for kindergarten registration was in September (my birthday is in October) I had to wait a year.   So, I don't get to see him much except for outside of school things like going to a parent-supervised movie or the mall. Which gets... annoying.   We aren't bad kids or anything. My teachers love me. I organize charity events. I have all A's, and I'm almost never grounded. I'm not exaggerating. My boyfriend is a good kid, too. He gets pretty good grades too (although he didn't do good in Spanish recently and is grounded).   So there is a casual dance coming up at the high school. Anyone is allowed to attend. Anyone can go if you are someone's date. It is supervised by teachers.   When I tried to bring up going to my dad, he gave me NO chance to explain why I want to go. I said, "There is a dance coming up at the high school and-" He says- "Well you aren't going!" I asked, "Why not?" He says, now in a very aggravated tone "Because you're only 14, that's why!" I didn't say anything because I didn't want to aggravate him.   My friends in high school are 14.   My question is, why is my dad so upset about this? Why won't he give me a chance to explain? Is there any way I can bring this up again to possibly get permission to go? Please help. Thanks.      10 pts best answer

Are there any new wonder drugs or procedures out there that he doesn't know about since he feels he already knows the answer?  I wish I knew whether it was primary or secondary - he was born with it because his POS birth mother did drugs while pregnant.  I guess I'm just wondering if I should focus more on all the other ways there are out to find our child.  It's just that I've secretly held out hope that he's wrong and there IS a magical pill that will somehow let us make a child.

20090131195826AAOvpaw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do i get back in the game without really knowing any of the girls i like?	ill tell you some backround info first      Im 16 and ive only had 1 gf. I wasn't really considered a good person to be seen in public with and go harrassed alot during middle school and like my freshman year. in fact my girl friend went to another school and I was lucky because we didnt even know each other but just had a conversation when we were doing nothing and just stumbled into eachother when waiting for our rides home. She had to move a week after we got serious and it turned into long distance and ended kindov dramatically when a month later when we had an argument and she instantly and without warning cut me off and I never got to speak to her again. It really devastated me and it happened last spring. It took me until a month or two to get over her 100%.      Now this is the situation and question.      Ive now been ready to get back in the game since around the start of school but I no longer know how to get back into it.Im not Ugly and Im a little more popular though I draw the line when comes to hanging with jocks and the popular rich kids. Im friendly and I can have a normal conversation with a girl but I become instantly shy when it comes to flirting or dating. For example during this year in my first semester which just ended, there was a senior across the room who started to look at me and smile and all I would do is just make eye contact then look towards the teacher again but I would sometimes smile back but didn't think much of it. As time went by she was slightly loosing interest as I was gaining interest but didn't know how to act on it because I didn't know her. Now I have lost that oppurtunity but I am now surrounded by girls in my French 2 class who I also dont really know and was thinking about trying to just talk but I feel if it starts to turn kindov flirty all the other girls will notice at the same time and I will be seen as some wannabe player. Ive thought about doing after school clubs to get to know people like I did in XC but I spend my time after school training to enlist in the army with an option 40 contract(Airborne school and Ranger Indoc Program for 75th). What can I do to start dating a girl from one of my classes without getting to know them through clubs and not seem like a wannabe player.   Im not ugly, weak, or dumb either and I have friends I hang with during school.
20090131201620AAC9IzQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	When trying to conceive and not having much luck?	don't you just hate it when people say "you need to have a kid" or "when are you going to get pregnant"?      And I know that parents can't help but show off their little ones to people, but when they talk about their kids allllll the time to a friend who they know is having trouble getting pregnant is kind of cruel.

20090131152533AAvtJWS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this nesting or what?	I'm 38.3 weeks preggo.  2 days ago I did projects, cleaned, etc., and felt like I had a ton of energy (I also slept well the night before....that's rare!) and got a lot done.  However, I had no excuse not to b/c we stayed home from work due to an ice storm.  Today, I feel the 'urge' to get some stuff done, mainly decorating, but I'm friggin EXAUSTED.  I feel like I'm pushing through the exaustion, though, b/c I really want it done.        I thought 'nesting' gave you a surge of energy.  So, am I or am I not nesting today?

Anyway, Jamie (who will be 3 weeks) can't come into the room with me while I take the test, even if he's asleep. (Yet the guy giving the exams thought it would be ok to talk on his phone while I was taking one Tuesday, UGH.)      So anyway, I can't ask Mom to take off again, Daddy..... can't handle him, and my younger sister has school. PLUS he won't take a bottle unless he's been screaming for ten minutes.      I just don't know what to do.... There's not really anyone else who can come with me, and leaving him an hour away from where I'm going makes me VERY uncomfortable, but I HAVE to take this test...

20090131194007AA3fcLk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My sister wants me to take her daughter, even though i have 5 kids and i'm pregnant with another? ?	My sister is divorced, and the dad of her daughter is a nutcase. She wants to send the daughter to us, and the sons to my brother in Virginia. She is 14 years old, which is Emma's age and i am sure Emma wouldn't mind since they get along so well,but i have 5 kids and i'm pregnant with a baby girl. That's 7 kids. And Christine didn't say, "Can Jordyn stay with you for a while?" It was, "I am sending Josh and Caleb to Davids and i was wondering if Jordyn can stay with you and go to high school there." And i replied, "Christie, i would love to but i have 5 kids and im pregnant and having a hard enough time going between 5 kids and trying to make a nursery for Savannah when shes born. I don't know. " and Christine says, "Well, okay good! Talk to Christopher (my husband), i will have her down there around march 1st." Okay, is she deaf? I have 5 kids, and i'm pregnant, and that's a BIG decision!      I really know that Jordyn needs this, but i don't know if i can accommodate another person in this house, and i am just afraid that Christine is shipping her kids off so she can get a boyfriend and not take care of kids anymore. I have told her that seperating the children would make this harder for them, and that Jordyn would be incredibly upset for having to move her, and this may negatively affect my family, and Christine doesn't seem to think so? I dont want to say no, because Jordyn needs attention and love especially at this age, and Christine obviously can't give that to her, which can cause Jordyn and her brothers trouble. My brother agreed to the boys, but won't take Jordyn. This must make her feel unwanted and unloved. I really want jordyn to come, but i am afraid the outcome won't be good.       What would you do if you were in my situation?

20090226074908AAfWePX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	1st Ultrasound update!  Plus a question?	I just had my 6 week 3 day ultrasound yesterday and they found the lil baby (just 1) and it measured 6 weeks 2 days.  So right where it's supposed to be.  My hubby and I also heard the heartbeat for the very first time (completely wonderful!)  and it was 116 beats per minute (perfect for right now).  So everything looks really great with the baby.  I did have a cyst on my right ovary + my corpus luteum on my right ovary, but the dr. said the cyst should dissipate on it's own.     My question is:  Does anyone know how much the heartbeat increases with each passing day??     Also: Anyone have a cyst during pregnancy that wasn't the corpus luteum? Did it dissipate?        Thank you all so much! :)
20090131150721AAbGwxM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do I teach my 3 yr old to respect her things?	We call our 3 yr old daughter destructo because she wrecks alot of her things and ours. She just takes things apart, rips off things, steps on them, chews on them to the point that its just garbage and gets thrown away and she doesnt even care.       Its frustrating when we buy things for her or she gets given a gift and she just destroys it. She has also broke alot of our special things that are now in the garbage....things she knows not to climb up and get.       Any ideas on how to teach her to treat things nicely with respect???

20090131155653AAt4Ff8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can swaddling be bad?	my 3 month old had really bad colic when she was 5 weeks old the only way i could get her to sleep at night was to wrap her up tight with 2 blankets, one going up over each arm and then back under her back, where she would keep her arms by her side, and the other just wrapping her up like normal. i know it sounds crazy, but its like using the miracle blanket. and it works miracles! she goes right to sleep at night. but now she is 3 months old and im worried that wrapping her up like this isnt good for her. i know babies begin to find their own comfortable position during the night and she cant because shes wrapped up and im worried about her arm muscles. am i over worrying or should i try to break her of being wrapped up like this? i would really like good opinions and fact not just negative comments, i know wrapping her up in a "straight jacket" doesnt sound good, i didnt think so either at first, but it was the only way to relieve her colic and shes comfortable in it. thank you! and i will pick a best answer (:

I do all my housework when my son sleeps and still get on with things i used to do.. ie food shopping. he doesnt get mis treated in any way.    but i feel so alone, my partner has never been the affectionate type and ive always got on without it, did things by myself and its never bothered me, even went to all my antenatals app alone.    i dnt feel any connection with my son or with my partner anymore. i dont believe that he is my child and that he was part of me, i miss being pregnant and want him back in my bump so i do feel connected to him. i loved giving birth( had an epi!) and would do it all again for the experience. i thought i would of felt some kinda change when i became a parent but i dont, i dont feel like a mum, just a carer for a newborn.    my partner and i have had a problem/issue with his commitments ie his hobbies and was promised he wouldnt do any until the baby was a month old but come to a push he went out when my son was a week old and broke that promise(hes in a band and does gigs... would rather be the next kurt cabain rather then a dad/partner)   .I know nothing can change it but i feel so distant from him now, i even asked for a cuddle the other day and he said maybe i would get one(i didnt).       Nothing makes me feel happy anymore, i used to love shopping but now its like a chore( im doing the night feeds too which is so draining)      Am i losing my mind??? should i feel like this???

20090131152909AA5iR7n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What are your experiences and opinions on this?	My son is 7 months old. he has had every food except any meat, strawberries, egg whites, peanuts or seafood that you can pretty much think of. My younger brother was allergic to chicken for about 6 months of his life when he was a little younger than my baby. I don't want to risk my son being allergic to it too so I have held off on giving him any. When do you think it will be safe to try him on it? Also, How much and how often should he be getting solids? He's a pretty big boy - 22 lbs and  30" long. Another thing - what kind of table/finger foods can I give him? He doesn't have any teeth yet but he's a pretty independent eater and we usually give him his foods in a safe feeder. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

20090131193412AA0R9oV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Can I get parents opinions about providing daycare?	I have a three month old son, and went back to work a little over a month ago.  Now it's come down to me going back to my second job, and I'm really not wanting too.  I was thinking for about the last year, that I wouldn't go back to the second job, but rather provide daycare, or rather night care at home.  Then I can be home with my baby, he can have friends, and I'll still have the second job,but it will be one I WANT to do.  I love kids, and have always been a babysitter or nanny, until I graduated and started working at an insurance company during th day.      I want to cater mainly to people that work odd hours, like servers/bartenders etc, or people that work 2nd or 3rd shift.  I'm willing to deal with the odd scheduling that a lot of service industry people have, but I can still make it fun for the kids.  I'm obsessed with germs, good food, and safety for kids, and playing with them to learn, not having them watch TV.        Only problems I can see are a. I have two cats.  Personally, when my baby is in daycare 2 mornings a week, I don't mind pets.  I checked them to make sure they wern't aggressive, and had all shots, but how do other parents feel about pets?  Mine arent' aggressive, they hide from kids, and are healthy.      Other problem, I live in an apartment.  The patio door is always locked, but is that a major detterent for parents?  I don't have a ton of room,  because of all the kids stuff, but I live close to parks, and walking trails.      What do you think?  I know how I am with kids, and I'm prepared for any extra stress, but I want to do something that I LIKE instead of a crappy serving job (even though I'd make more money serving!)      I'm thinking no more than 2 kids, a few nights and then weekends.  I have an extra bed area for a baby, and of course all the toys a kid could dream of, for every age (I went a little overboard with the baby/kid stuff while prego)

I am 7 1/2 - 8 weeks pregnant, I went and had an ultrasound a week ago baby's heart beat was great. however ive been (foolishly) taking benzodiazepines (about 10mg klonopin 8mg ativan roughly, altogether since i got pregnant, these arent daily doeses). some of this was around 4-5 wks and the rest was 6wks until now.. i am very worried my baby will have birth defects.please someone help me out. is there anything i can do?    my question is.. Is the medicine that i have already taken going to cause birth defects?
20090131200912AA2TgoX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Hypothetically, say I'm a single mom, and have been for 8 years. I'm almost 30 years old and have no real...?	love interests in my life. Being a mother has been the most incredible thing in my life and I want more kids before I'm too old to chase them around the house.    Let's say, hypothetically I have been thinking about having more kids with out a man involved. There are three ways to go about this. Either IVF, buying sperm and trying to impregnate myself, or adoption.    I've talked to people in my family about this already, (None have been a single mom before but I have. And they all think I should find a man first), but I would like to hear what a non-objective party thinks.     As far as those 3 choices, what is the most cost effective? And what do you think of a single mother, who wants more kids as a single mother?    And if you were wondering, yes I can afford it, and yes I have the time for it. Thanks.
20090131154840AAc1zDa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What Can be Done to Help This Child?	He is 7 years old and has been formally diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and ADHD.  He is not in school because he cannot sit still in a class room setting. So he is presently being home schooled. He is disruptive and will not behave. He will not allow anyone to discipline him in any way shape or form. The only thing that works is the reward system. He constantly complains of aches and pains in his body. He wants to be treated like a baby, that is he wants to be cooed and tickled as if he were a newborn. He constantly wants to be called by his "pretend" names, otherwise he will not respond. He can be extremely cheerful, and generally is sweet, but must always get his way-or else will try to make one miserable. The child has been scheduled for an evaluation to attempt to figure out how he can be helped academically and perhaps have some schooling outside the home. He is presently not on any medication. He is however, being seen by a child psychologist on a weekly basis and does see a psychiatrist once a month. What can be done to help him? Please tell me, because I don't know everything, maybe am missing something. I want him to have as normal a life as possible.

My baby will be 6 1/2 months old in a week or so, and i was wondering from parents when you started your child on training/sippy cups?

Our (soon to be) 11 month old daughter was recently diagnosed with a severe milk allergy, so we are steering clear of anything with milk in it for a long time.

20090226080346AAZGuvq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	First pregnancy- silly worries, need reassuring!?	I'm about 6 weeks pregnant and I got a positive test last sunday. I went to the doctors the next day and she didn't do any tests but she did prod my tummy about and said it felt ok. I know everyone has silly things they worry about during pregnancy but I'm worrying because I keep getting what feels like period pain, and I know this is normal but I've been getting it for 2 weeks now. 2 nights it's woken me up in the middle of the night. It's not unbearable it just scares me that something might be wrong. Also my boobs do hurt but only if I poke them quite hard, yet it sounds like pregnant women's boobs are really painful.

20090131173059AAtWXC9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Convince parents to let me pierce my nose?	I have very religious parents and could really use some help with ways to convince them to get this done.      I've already asked them once,   but it was right after they found out my friend got hers pierced so they think thats the reason I want mine pierced.   Its not. I've wanted mine done for about two years now, I told my friend that I wanted it done and was just waiting to ask my parents at the right time/in the right way, well after I tell her all this, she goes and gets hers done.      Anyway, after I asked my parents, they said something to the effect of, "You're in our house, and you're going to live by our rules." When I asked why they were against it, they said something like, "Infections can't be fun." I told them, "The chance of infection isn't very high if you take care of it, my ears never got infected." I got this as a reply to that, "Higher than if you don't get it done." Later that evening I showed them a Bible verse in Ezekiel about the Lord putting a ring in someone's nose and my dad said, "Thats description, not prescription." I asked him what he meant by that and he said, "It's not telling you 'go do this' its just describing something that happened." so then I said, "Its not telling you not to.." and he said, "No. End of discussion."      Now that I've sort of "opened them up" to the idea, (believe me, that no was not a definite no.) I'd love some ideas to convince them.      I'm sixteen by the way and am very sure I want this done, and please don't tell me to just wait until I move out, I'm already aware of this option and I'm not very fond of it.
20090131162139AAbLlZV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant or something else?	Over the course of the last week and a half I've had terrible acid reflex (not too sure, but thats what I assumed). It feels like heartburn but in my stomach... Now, I'm a few days late on my period. I've also noticed I'm eating more. I'm a small person and my hip bones used to slightly stick out and in the course of the last 2 weeks you cannot even find them. I just took a pregnancy test but it did nothing (no pregnant or not pregnant result)...I'm in a committed relationship and a baby is more than welcomed. But, I'm just wondering if this stomach burning is natural? I plan on taking another pregnancy test as soon as I'm able to go... but until then, I'm sittting here not knowing what to do.

Also, when my dad or anyone else like my friends mentions anything close to having to do with girls, she gets all mad and the atmosphere in the room is really awkward.   oh yeah...I dont have any intentions of drinking or drugs or anything like that and my parents should now this--Also my friends arent like that either.   For example: Ive had these 2 twins as a friends 4 a long long time. Their parents are really cool, and they were having this party at their house. Boys and Girls were invited---Only the best friends of the twins were invited 2 the after party sleepover. (of course there were no girls invited 2 the sleepover). Also, the party was going 2 be supervised, and there would be no drugs or alcohol, and none of the friend circle would do things like that anyways...I asked them 2 go and told them all the details, but they got all mad because girls were going 2 be there.   Basically i wanna have a life and 2 not be stalked by my parents 24/7.   Tips and advice would help...     its not like asking out on a date...>.> nvm adults dont understand...lol but i cant hang out with my friends or even play jailbreak ant night or anything liek tht...and im almost 14 lol...>. .<    i havent lost their trust cause ive been cooped up all my life...lol I respect them and I wish i could get that respect of being an adolescent growing up.   Ok, im tired about "someday i will understand" crap cause its not good 4 me to have no life and im lucky theres a thing called school, otherwise I wouldn't have any friends...T.T

20090131200231AAZnjBo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Will labor be starting soon?	I'm 37 weeks pregnant, so I'm full term and I've been having diarrhea but not like super painful diarrhea, just every bowel movement I have is loose and I'm having like 4 per day which is unusual. I'm not quite sure if my baby has dropped yet... since I don't feel a lot of pressure in my pelvis or anything. Every once in a while I get menstral like cramps, like a few times a day. Last week I had my doctor check for dialation and he said I was 2cm dialated. And I've been having these crazy dreams about my water breaking or bleeding and having my bloody show, what is up with that? Although this is completely pointless my Mom told me she had a gut feeling that I'm going to give birth within the next couple weeks and my Mom never says stuff like that. it kinda freaked me out. I just wanna know what everyone else thinks and if anyone has experienced these same symptoms before they went into labor... HELP! It's driving me crazy.

20090131195820AAP5N6X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What to do if you are transgender?	This has really been a long time in the making, I was born female but have always thought of myself as male. I never knew what it was until I saw the word 'transgender' online a few months back, but it is definitely the word I needed.      I've tried to explain this to my parental guardian, but she, unfortunately, doesn't fully understand this. She believes I'm gay because I wear 'boy' clothes and have short hair. Complicating this is the fact that I live in a small town with a very strong religious influence in the family (Christianity, of course). I'm scared to talk to anyone else in the family about this, and I'm scared to go to the church for an answer (Everyone knows everyone, if I tell one person I don't trust, they'll end up telling the rest of my family anyway). To top this off, I want to question my doctor about beginning hormone therapy.      What should I do? I hate living as someone I'm not.

20090131175831AASApVD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What do I do about this guy who won't leave me alone?	I became friends with this guy and I thought he was really cool, and that we could become good friends. I didn't feel any attraction towards him. One day he texts me saying that he's a vampire. I thought he was joking but the next day he came up to me and sounded so serious. He showed me the teeth that are supposed to be sharp, and they were.      I didn't (and still don't) believe that he's a vampire and I think he was only saying that because of his teeth, but after that every time he texted me he was talking about drinking blood and how he has get it from the animals at the butchers shop. I was like ooookay, and I stopped texting him and we didn't talk for a couple weeks. (we basically only talked by text because we're in different grades so it's hard to see each other at school).      Lately he has been texting me a lot, and he says he likes me. He keeps asking if he can bite me. I say no, but he keeps asking. Eventually I just stop texting him, but a couple hours later I get a text saying 'hi' from him and if I don't respond to it, he texts me again, and again, and again...So I do respond to it and then the conversation leads to him asking if he can bite me. Again.      I told him to stop asking but he just replies with 'why?' and asks again.      I don't know how to get him to back off.

20090226081201AATTK3U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Safety gadgets for toddlers?	I am the mother of a budding engineer.  Robby is 18 months old and into everything, much more than big sister was!  He's also much bigger and more mobile, so he can reach things at a younger age, and we have a cat now, which we didn't have the first time around.      Question 1:  Are toilet locks worthwhile?  How much of a pain are they to install and use?  The bathroom door doesn't close well, so the only way to keep him out is to put up a baby gate, which is inconvenient for the rest of us!        Question 2:  We have a covered cat litter box, but he has learned to work the latches!  Any ideas?  Due to the floor plan of our house, there is absolutely NO other place to put the litter box.  It has to be opened daily for scooping.      How best to keep Robby out of these highly desirable "toys?"

I'm not seriously training my toddler (she's almost 2), but we bought her a potty, and she sits on it, sometimes, to get used to it... The other day, she tinkled in it, and freaked out, crying, and now she doesn't want to sit on it, which is fine. (We're being very casual.) She shows all the signs of being ready, yet it scared her to go!       I'm fine with waiting until she's really ready, but my concern is, what if she won't be ready on her own? Is there anything I can do to help her understand she did a *good* thing? :) We already praised her, etc., without over-doing it, but that didn't help her feel better.

20090226080619AAmsnm9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is my 16 Month old developing ok?	So I'm a bit of a worry wart in the motherhood department.  I read WAY TOO much into the milestone charts and I know I shouldn't.  I was just wondering, based on other mommy experiences--if my son was ok for his age.  He has always been on the tail end of normal with the milestone charts.  He sat up at 7 months.  Rolled over at 7. Walked at 14.  He is currently 16 months and doesn't talk to much.  He can say NO! NO! (Go! Go!) and my dog's name, "day see". He will say BEEEP when my husband's fire pager goes off and very occasionally will say Baby at himself in the mirror.  He does NOT say mama or dada yet.  he does not point to things.  however--he will take my hand or pull me towards something he wants.  He pretends to brush his hair or feed himself.  He runs, but doesn't jump.  He just started to climb.  He does not give kisses or hugs yet.  He LOVES to read.  He brings me books ALL DAY LONG and tries to wiggle into my lap. Although I limit the amount--he does enjoy TV shows like the Wiggles and Blues Clues.  He loves music.  He feeds himself with a fork, but only if I put the food on the fork for him. I introduced crayons the other day but he loses interest quickly and wants to eat them.  He is VERY, VERY good with both fine and gross motor skills.  He understands how things work.  He can follow a FEW simple commands like--Go get your ball, do you want juice, where's your head.  But he only listens 50% of the time.      Does this sound about right?  Whenever I see another baby on  play dates and see the other stuff they do, I get a little nervous.  I want to stop comparing and just enjoy him....but in order to do that I need to know that he is ok.  Will all the other stuff--pointing, talking, kissing, coloring, etc come with time??
