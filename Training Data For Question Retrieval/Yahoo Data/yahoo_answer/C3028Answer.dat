Write letters to your friends/family. Send them birthday cards in the mail. Send your checks with your bills in the mail. Your 42 cents per letter/bill plus your neighbors plus everyone else's would add up to a whole lot of money and create work for those employees.    Or, they do need to scale back because their business is out dated.
