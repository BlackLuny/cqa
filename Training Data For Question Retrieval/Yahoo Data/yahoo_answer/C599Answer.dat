xYTagSIyaa	salt thing?  What do you mean?  The very best thing you can do for a sore throat is gargle with salt water.  There is no research that says vitamin C helps, water and lemon with honey is  okay but not as good as the salt water gargle.  If you are spiking a fever or if you see white blobs at the back of your throat you need to see a doctor to get antibiotics.  Yes, you probably have laryngitis.|`|JkoZzjwaaa	i know you don't want to do the salt thing but that may help you the most (it isn't as bad as everyone says) also its really harp to tell whether you have laryngitis i would talk to a doctor (or the equivalent) beacause no one here can tell you what you have just by reading what you say beacause what you described can be over 50 diffrent illnesses and infections. sorry for the bad news     hope you feel better     Andrew|`|tLncILzkaa	here r the symptoms and treatments   Symptoms of Laryngitis    The major symptoms of laryngitis are:  Hoarseness  Sore throat  Weak or absent voice  Sensation of a lump in the throat or constant need to clear the throat  Dry cough  Fever    Diagnosis of Laryngitis    Diagnosis is based upon a combination of the clinical history and a physical exam. Some physicians might wish to do a laryngoscopy (visualization of the vocal cords).    Treatment of Laryngitis    If laryngitis is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics will be prescribed.  Some palliative measures that can be taken include:    Avoid public speaking during recovery  Be aware that whispering puts greater strain on the vocal cords than normal speaking  Inhale steam from a bowl of hot water or from a warm shower  Drink warm, soothing liquids (but do not drink alcoholic beverages)  Try a cool-mist humidifier; avoid air conditioning  Use nonprescription pain relievers and throat lozenges to ease the discomfort  Avoid cigarettes until the symptoms have subsided  Above all, make sure that the underlying cause of chronic laryngitis has been diagnosed and treated.|`|2flYH6ogaa	Laryngitis usually does not cause any kind of pain, and if it does, it's not severe. It sounds like you either have a sore throat from a virus, or possibly a bacterial infection like strep or tonsillitis. Take paracetamol (or Tylenol). There isn't much that will get rid of a sore throat. Just hang in there.    Thanks for the vote of confidence there mate but I get laryngitis all the time. It is annoying but it's really not painful, unless you're a bit of a wuss. Strep throat is purely hideous, tho, which is why I mentioned it, and it can certainly cause difficulty speaking. Sorry my answer wasn't more dramatic...? :S
uMNoVPxoaa	I don't think you can have any dignity until you get back into treatment so you progress past this.  If the only advancement you've made was to figure out how to conceal (not very well, by the way) the fact you can't stop, well, maybe you need to put your efforts into something that'll move you in the healthy direction.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Go to them and promise you will start seeing an eating disorder specialist. Tell them they are free to search your room whenever they want because obviously they don't seem to trust you.    You could tell them that you are serious about getting help and you need their support.     Of course you can have dignity - bulimia is very common - you are not alone and you shouldnt feel embarassed you should just be concerned about your health and try to get some help.    Good luck.|`|yerK8PJ9aa	their kicking you out cause you have bulimia! they should be helping you! thats horrible. and its really not that embarrassing. bulimia is a problem! they need to help you. poor darl.|`|kEgXrX0saa	There are thousands of people who suffer from eating disorders. The first step is getting help. The condition you have can be treated but you also have to see someone, its difficult to manage on your own. You can destroy your body, when you bring food up,your placing yourself in grave danger. After a while, it will damage vital organs and can lead to death. I'm sure your parents are at their wits end. Its not easy to watch your child slowly destroy their body. Please be smart, talk with your parents, but, also get some help. Its really serious what your doing, its not a game, its your life your playing with. Please be careful
Ivgd8sSCaa	Well generally for 6 months you wear it 24/7  I am definentaly not doing that right now though =P Only at night.  Eventually they tell you to go to night wear. It think it is best to wear it as long as you can. Your teeth really move|`|UHEvZMNtaa	i don't know. i thought i was going to have to get one, but i never did...    for me, he said it wouldnt be long|`|1fIQXPP5aa	24/7 for like 4-6 months    then only at night until you're like 20-25  then at night about 3 times a week...basically forever haha|`|35uGFC9qaa	i wear mine 2/7...so even when i sleep...  but u can take it out when u eat cause ur retainer might break..|`|7pOijPMRaa	It is usually 1 year of 24/7 and 6 months of 12/7
AEAxZEveaa	Like right this second you have allergies or just in life? If it's right this second I would say take some benadryl, that will help immediately. If you just mean in general, see your allergist.|`|qSHlehJzaa	try over the counter ones first they are cheaper
mDgIsma9aa	drinking vinegar is supposed to help....drinking  several table spoons a day. but i have never done it so i really cant say if it works or not.|`|qg8o4gH5aa	never heard of it, ur better off drink green tea.. it tastes better and helps with that issue|`|y0wZqYtcaa	Going to the gym, and working out!|`|BdlGBdE5aa	You are asking a question because you want to appear looking great to other people.  I will not comment on the flat stomach but I will comment on the bad breath.  Actually, all of us have some amount of bad breath(even when we don't eat garlic) and the problem is we can not smell our own bad breath.  So, I brush my teeth and then clean my tongue to get rid of the bacteria that cause almost all of our bad breath.  I use OraBrush and some mouthwash and it really controls bad breath.  My wife tells me when I have bad breath because she will not kiss me if my breath is bad.

But you need to make sure you keep eating because the taller you get, the thinner you are going to be if you don't gain any weight.|`|ldwlzFfQaa	thats fine. im 14 and weigh 88. perfectly fine|`|9pRe7vx4aa	i think your too skinny.|`|zblFCh7Paa	O.o i weighed the same when i was that age  but im 14 and weigh 118 so i think your ok|`|iCKkOWI7aa	think ur too skinny|`|uqRb9tAqaa	If you're 5'3" you should probably gain a little weight, but not necessarily. Just make sure you're eating enough.     Still, it all depends on muscle mass, fat mass, bone mass, and everything else. So the best way to make sure you're weight is okay to eat healthy, at least 1,500 calories a day - and to get some exercise in. Than you're body will find where it's meant to be.     xoxo  Simona|`|QxbOXDFRaa	yea i am pretty sure, i am sixteen, 5'2" and i weigh like 87...so you're perfect!...well depending on your height...|`|627pWyVkaa	Yeah you should probably be a little bit more like 105-115. Just try not to lose anymore weight.|`|y0wZqYtcaa	yeah that is average|`|lK7RSKTUaa	to me that sounds a little below average but it all depends on your hieght|`|z6fF9Fsoaa	Yup that's a great weight!

YIW1KIi6aa	Food allergies have been considered a major cause of stomach ulcers. An elimination/challenge diet can help identify the allergenic food(s) and continued elimination of these foods can assist in healing the ulcer.    Ulcer patients should avoid aspirin, stop smoking, avoid antacids, and reduce stress. Dietary changes include avoidance of sugar, caffeine, and alcohol, and reducing milk intake.    Supplements    Dietary supplements that help to control ulcer symptoms include:        * vitamin A      * B-complex vitamins      * vitamin C      * vitamin E      * glutamine      * rice bran oil (gamma oryzanol)      * selenium      * deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL)      * zinc picolinate    Herbals    Botanical medicine offers the following remedies that may help treat ulcers:        * Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus): heals ulcers.      * Cabbage: heals ulcers.      * Calendula (Calendula officinalis): heals duodenal ulcers.      * Chamomile tea: speeds healing, reduces mucosal reaction, reduces stress, and lessens gas.      * Comfrey (Symphytum officinale) root: soothes the stomach, lessens bleeding, and speeds healing, however, the patient must take caution, in that prolonged or excessive use can be harmful to the liver.      * Geranium (Pelargonium odoratissimum): lessens bleeding.      * Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra): heals ulcers.      * Marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis) root: soothes the stomach.      * Meadowsweet: soothes the stomach.      * Plantain (Plantago major): soothes the stomach.      * Slippery elm (Ulmus fulva): lessens bleeding and heals mucous membrane.      * Wheat grass (Triticum aestivum): heals ulcers.
zGKmgwofaa	It's closely related to Diphenhydramine HCl, which is frequently used recreationally. It causes deep sedative effects, and at high doses can cause hallucinations.    You can learn more about it's effects by searching for Diphenhydramine because it is literally identical as far as effects go.    As far as your roomate stealing them, I don't think that would make much sense. Diphenhydramine is incredibly easy to get and two wouldn't have much of an effect at all.    So I doubt there is any drug theft going on here. :)    Email for any more information.
tg8Q25IHaa	I think it's normal that you feel that way, since you and him were so close and you haven't gotten over it. You should try to make yourself feel better by thinking that your grandpa would want to see you well and not suffering this way... He's not with you physically but the special relationship you had will always be a part of you. I hope you can try to talk about this with someone from your family or a friend, with someone that can help you. I wish you the best and please keep in mind your grandad would want to see you happy.

I was the same way when my grandmother passed away. But don't worry time will make things better and you will eventually feel better.So don't dispare the sadness will fade. Everyone is different in how they mourn the loss of a loved one.Just remember that he might not be here physically but he will always be in you're heart.|`|bf72cfdf93e36079005e699867cef828aa	sorry for your loss. I lost my grandparent when i was real young.  work through it. I am sure your grandad would want you to live your life to its fullest. It is good to remember him. Try to make that memory a pleasent one and hold it close and keep it with you as you go about your day. Obviously not wanting to go out is normal as you have become perhaps a bit more serious about life due to the loss of some one you love. It is ok. Learn from it. Love and live your life. I am sure he would have wanted it, yeah?
XmudUg2aaa	Find a job...then live within your means.    Don't rent to own ANYTHING.     Only buy what you can pay cash for...and only pay for what you NEED not want.     Get a land line next time and skip the cell phone...a lot cheaper.    Sounds like it's time to grow up and start making better choices.     Don't get down...I was in the same spot as you when I was younger. Couldn't find or keep a job, no food in the fridge, no lights, etc....yadah yadah yadah.     Be encouraged sister....it don't rain all ways.|`|BOOIXJeQaa	If you live in the UK, you can call samaritans when you need someone to talk to, and there are youth hostels around to help you gain jobs and have a place to stay.  If you're in the US, look for local ads in windows and try and get a new job and have your life back on track.  If you're a religious person, maybe the church is somewhere to turn to, if you're not, perhaps finding something that brings back your happiness is worth looking for, in the end,even though things are rough, I'm sure with help, you can get back to a decent way of living...even if it's all seems far away.|`|jNGkdSz1aa	how did you get on a computer then ?
I1bAIFMXaa	Hey, my name is Cameron and I am 18. I am about to graduate from high school. I know exactly what you are talking about. I had that same problem a few years ago, I still do. All my friends are super popular and all that. I am just kind of shy so I stay out of the lime light. What worked best for me was to just realize that every one there is just like you in some way. No one is better or worse. If you are a little shy that's fine, I still am. If anyone doesn't like that about you then that is too damn bad for them. High school is one big party, don't miss out on it. Always live with no regrets. Best of Luck|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Are you being treated for your depression and do you have a counselor?  You should see about getting one if you don't, because it's the ongoing consultation of a regular person that will help you to work your way through this.    Good luck.

b1580e3d6f73c9d9495a1dde6ceb4c23aa	Keep a deodorant in your locker. Or better yet, wear paper towels under your armpits ! It sounds crazy, but some people have tried it and it worked for them...|`|3TT2ErHZaa	When you start to smell, run to a bathroom and wash your underarms with soap and water and put on deoderant.

ixHwF4apaa	changing your diet is good, low calorie food. but just full fasting or taking water alone is not wise. that will harm your body. daily for your routine you need minimum energy. that can be supplimented by the food alone, not by water. there are lot of treatment/exercise for weight losing|`|hIe7qLN5aa	You know its funny that you insulted me so much when you answered my question about what i should do to get through to american parents and kids who are over weight...I am the school teacher !!!

plhfe5Zaaa	You sound Bipolar. It's common to have ADD and Bipolar and it's common to have Bipolar and symptoms of ADD. You sound a lot like me with the symptoms you mentioned. I've had ADD for 11 years and Bipolar for 2 or 3 years. You can also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Bipolar or Bipolar with symptoms of GAD. If you think you have something and your doctor is telling you no then go get a 2nd opinion. This is YOUR life.    And yes having ADD or Bipolar and other things like that will mess with your life and give you a hard time.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Blood clot.

XWjcelFVaa	yea most likely filling is still in. i had a root canal done a few years ago and its still sensitive and hurts occasionally. try using a toothpaste like arm & hammer enamel care. if the pain isn't gone in 4-5 days then i guess its time to pay the dentist a visit.|`|xJWZTwFVaa	How abouts you go to a dentist, its a long shot but since they do teeth best...|`|tp61e25Eaa	I am going to my dentist Tuesday for the same thing, only mine are just 3 months old. 3 white fillings were put in 3 months ago. They all hurt, one really bad. I think the bad one got chipped when eating something crunchy. The others, the only thing I can think of is "whitening" toothpaste. Maybe it was too strong, I have heard of "whiteners" causing tooth pain. Maybe you chipped/damaged the filling on something? My sympathies to you, I know it hurts.   BTW, my dentist's name is Dr. Hannah|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Teeth can feel senstive at certain times espeically when we are run down - don't ask me why but they can.  However because its a tooth that you have previously had filled it makes me think that a tiny part of the filling has come out. You would be able to probably tell if the whole filling had come out as it would feel like a hole with your tounge.    Gp see a dentist they will sort it for you.      x

r8M4CRoTaa	? Builds self-esteem  Self-esteem is about knowing people value you. When you're part of a team, it's clear to see everyone has a role, and everyone is important, so being on a team naturally builds self-esteem.  ? Enables social interaction  Open-ended social interaction is difficult for some people (myself included.) It's hard to decide what subjects to talk about, what to say, etc. When I'm with a team working toward a common goal, it provides a great deal of focus and frees me from the stress of open-ended conversation. I find social interaction within teams much easier.  ? Enhances responsibility  Responsibility in day to day life can be difficult to achieve, if you are only accountable to yourself. When you're part of a team you have much more motivation to be responsible when you're accountable to everyone else.  ? Helps attain personal fitness goals  When I exercise alone, I'm always conscious of the work I'm doing, and quickly notice when I become tired. When I'm doing an activity with a team I don't think so much about myself, and the activity is usually fun, so I think less about how tired I'm getting and I'm able to do more.  ? Maintains wellness  It's healthy in every way. It improves fitness, provides an opportunity for socializing, and releases natural endorphins that counteract depression and make you feel good.  ? Improves skill level  In a team where everyone is trying to do their best, it brings out the best in you as well, and everyone is encouraged to improve by everyone else.  ? Builds commitment to practice  Practicing with a team builds discipline for practice and also demonstrates the benefits of practice, making it a clear choice for other areas in life as well.  ? Affects enjoyment of the activity  People are naturally inclined to feel good when they help other people. Doing an activity alone may not be especially fulfilling, but doing it with a team can be much more enjoyable.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	I don't know but i'd imagine it makes people feel like they are being paid attention and listened to, and feel in command.|`|X40Ww89qaa	i love PE|`|HimBbU6caa	None of the bullets are in the form of a question. Is this Jeopardy? How do we deal with this?|`|EuuIWdO0aa	-you become more confident in yourself  -your able to build friendship with teammates.  - on top of school work, you have to keep up your athletic ability and training  -a physically active lifestyle keeps in shape which helps achieve goals.  -you keep healthy  -practice often which helps skill level. PE helps work on basic skills  -more enjoyable which makes it more willing to practice on own  -gym helps you to enjoy the activity more because your teacher promotes it and you are doing it with your fellow students. :]|`|LGbBzpSlaa	Team participation makes everyone feel included, it gives the quieter and less confident people a responsibility and an opportunity to shine.   It allows everyone to join together and work as a group without making others feel left out. Being put into teams allows people to work with others that aren't necessarily within their main friendship group, this encourages communication and interaction.   Every person on a team has a job and a responsibility, it is up to the individual to perform and live up to the expectations. I think that for someone to create fitness goals they must enjoy exercise and must want to improve which means they must be determined and focused. Working in a team can be a good way to note improvements.   Obviously, as everyone knows, with a balanced diet and correct sleep, exercise leads to a healthy, well person. Once in the habit of exercising regularly, it maintains this wellness.   Continued, correct execution of a certain sport or action usually leads to noticable improvements in skill level. This also links in with the fitness goals, as you begin to see improvement, you find the incentive to continue acheiving. This keeps you commited and encourages you to work towards a healthier you.   Someone wouldn't continue exercising if they didn't enjoy it, the enjoyment is what keeps everyone coming back for more. It leads to commitment. All the effects link together and lead to another.     Hope this is what you were looking for.   Sorry I've written so much, I love sport and I'm very bored!  x
xKYXurpNaa	Your complex carbs should be high fiber and whole grain such as whole grain pasta, brown rice, potatoes, OATS whole grain tortillas.    Your proteins should be lean (low fat) with the exception of salmon which has healthy fats.    Seeds are important such as flax seeds because you need essential fats especially omega 3s for healthy body function.    3000 Calories sounds good, but you have to try for a week, measure your fat and weight and go from there.|`|GfyovDF5aa	Yeah, around 3,000 calories is about right for you.  Your friend is right, protein and carbs are essential when trying to gain lean muscle mass.  I would try to eat 6 meals a day (each meal containing 500 calories).  The key is though, to still eat healthy meals.  Don't go out and order a Big Mac because you know that will make you gain weight.  Do you drink protein shakes?  Try blending two scoops of protein with 1 cup milk, 1 bannana and 2 Tablespoons of peanut butter.  I would drink 1-2 of these a day.  You can add yogurt or other fruits as well is you don't like peanut butter.  Yes pasta and lean protein sources are important.  Chicken, fish and lean red meat is important for you.  Try to buy whole wheat pasta if you can, that is more nutritious.  Also, snack on nuts. Nuts are a great source of unsaturated fat and a small amount is pretty caloric.      Hope this helps you!
IkicLCLkaa	Well I have had anaemia on and off for years...When my iron was high enough i donated blood no problem, but at blood donor sessions (UK) they check the iron first before you donate, if it isnt high enough you cant donate blood for your own safety.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Don't.

ItJzrvQ4aa	go  wheat  free. No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food after 7  p.m.  People  achieve  marvellous  results  with it. Depending on your  initial  weight,  you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If you don't  eat  wheat  then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey cakes, you  don't  eat  junk  food,  and  you don't eat biscuits. But your diet is  still  balanced. It costs nothing, and you do not have to calculate points or  to buy special meals or plans.|`|Hzzdalavaa	Don't eat loads of junk food.|`|LPO8RlVdaa	Forget about losing weight. Just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!    For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)    You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!    This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.    The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise.     Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier.     I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you.     But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off.     Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.    There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.    Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights.     But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).    Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.    Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.    These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights.     As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.    Hope this helps.|`|Dhz4XgQ3aa	Drink iced water, your body uses more calories warming it to body temperature and use it to fill you up before you eat. Then you will eat less. Have a glass before your meal.     Walk when you can rather then drive.    Detoxes are good to lose weight, fruit salad for breakfast, soup for lunch and fresh veg stirfry for dinner (use low cal olive oil spray).  Drink herbal tea, lots of water, no caffiene and snack on nuts and seeds and yoghurts.   Do for a week to two weeks.    Cutting out chocolate alone will mean you lose weight.    Goodluck|`|AA11053404	Don't go on a DIET!    Work out a healthy eating programme that you can live with - for life - and you will never have to diet agin!|`|6bryNB1raa	if you really cant be bothered to exercise one day just force yourself to go for a short walk i mean anythings better than nothing.    put a picture of yourself now on the fridge and everytime you go to the fridge you will remember the reason you want to diet.    eat lots of fruit and veg to fill up on and drink at least 8 glasses of water    exercise with a friend its always more fun    think of fun exercise you can do i mean just getting a few friends togther in the park to play frisbe is all exercise and you can have a laugh and catch up as well    make sure you always eat breakfast    never eat lower than 1200 cals    dont deprive yourself of anything we always want what we know we can have. a little bit of what you fancy does you good.    if you enjoy take out make sure you always allow yourself one say every 2 weeks as this will give you sopmething to look forward to.    walk instead of getting the bus if you drive park your car further away than you usually do.    take the stairs instead of lifts    shop shop shop everyone loves shopping and walking around a shopping centre or round town trying on diffrent clothes or shopping for cds or anything you like will burn calories and you come out with something you like    buy some hummas or a low cal dip and cut up raw carrots and eat as snacks very yummy     try roast veg instead of always having boiled or steamed just to make it diffrent some days    good luck :-)|`|qjT8sQmBaa	put down the fork|`|6LtmIxhCaa	Pretty easy.

f04zmzObaa	swollen glands are a tell tale sign of mono, as is chronic fatigue. If you had meningitis, you'd most likely have a severe headache. There's not really any way to tell just by looking at those symptoms. Go have a blood test done! Those are very vague symptoms that could be attributed to MANY different conditions. If you think you might have meningitis, i'd get to a doctor right away because the viral kind can really throw you for a loop if not treated. Mono is not such a big deal, but if you really want to know get a blood test. a doctor is the only one who can tell the difference for sure =] I'm a biomed major and to me, it sounds more like mono. especially with the swollen lymphs. Just get a quick blood test! feel better =[
sElOKkyEaa	When you're eating breakfast, lunch or dinner you normally want to fill half of your plate with a serving of fruit or vegetables, fill another quarter of your plate with whole grains, the last quarter of your plate should have some type of protein. It's seems overwhelming to cook up three different dishes to make your meal, so I usually opt for one pot meals. It saves me a lot of time. I work part-time and go to school full-time...so I don't have a lot of free time as it is. I usually spend less time cooking breakfast but when I have time I'll make omelets. For lunch sandwiches save me a lot of money. And it doesn't have to be the regular boring sandwiches you had in grade school...there's several recipes like "Chicken Caesar sandwich" or "Roast beef with Horseradish". Try making soups ahead of time to store in your fridge...they are really cheap to make because the ingredients usually call for chicken stock or fresh produce. Buying those items in bulk can help you make all different types of soups. I had Balsamic chicken with baby spinach for dinner tonight. I'll post the links for these recipes I mentioned.       Balsamic chicken w/baby spinach  (Just a heads up-this was bland for me so I added more dried herbs to the dish)|`|SJLgRqgSaa	chicken, begatbles, turkey, tuna and eggs are FULL of protein :)    have chicken rice and veg  noodles and chicken  tuna salad  etc    you can add honey too the chicken to make honey glazed chicken and there still good for you, or make bbq sauce.    also vegatbles roasted with some honey are delicious like carrots and parsnips!! xx|`|47R03TbFaa	MAKE A MEAT LOAF AND BAKE IT IN THE OVEN  MAKE SOME MASHED POTATOES   WHEN THE MEAT LOAF IS DONE DRAIN THE GREASE OFF   PUT THE MASHED POTATOES ON TOP OF THE MEAT LOAF AND PUT YOUR FAVORITE CHEESE ON TOP AND BAKE IN THE OVEN TIL CHEESE IS MELTED  GREAT PROTEIN   AND IF YOU WANT EXTRA PROTEIN PUT GROUND MUSHROOM IN IT|`|nY2hZrUMaa	lasanya is delishious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...      rasberriy fool is bufffffffffffffffffffffffffff|`|xKYXurpNaa	Breakfast - Muscle Milk & Oats - oatmeal w/ muscle milk protein     Lunch- Whole wheat Tortilla Chicken Wraps (pre made flavored chicken breast in lunch meat store) Microwave for 30 sec, I like southwestern flavor.    Dinner- Meat and Carbs - Use the foreman grill and microwave a sweet potato or make pasta.|`|0MunIx8raa	Homemade Vegetarian chili over brown rice is healthy and cheap.  Get a cheap can/bottle of plain speghetti sauce.  1 packet of chili seasoning, I use McCormick hot chili.  2 cans of kidney or pinto beans.  Rinse beans before adding, this rinses all the extra sodium off them.  You can mix the beans 1 kidney 1 pinto if you'd like.  Mix all these together.  Minute brown rice in a bag is the best and easiest way to go.  Cook chili for about 20 minutes and spoon over rice.  This gives you a whole protein and it's cheap and delicious. This would be good for dinner and then left overs for lunch.    Breakfast could be Bare Naked granola original w/protein and a cup of yogurt, mix them together for a yummy crunchy breakfast.  I use soy yogurt, but regular or soy has protien and so does the granola.  Plus this is pretty filling.|`|IRUa78qZaa	White Beans and Tomatoes - You need: Crock-pot, Olive oil, onion, garlic, 3 6 stalks of fresh rosemary, large can of diced tomatoes, and 2 cans of white/northern beans. Saut chopped onions in olive oil in the crock-pot on the high setting for about 15 minutes. Add chopped garlic and saut for 5 more minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients and let it cook on low in the crock-pot for however long you want. Nothing in this recipe needs cooking so its just a matter of the longer it cooks together the more flavor it will have. I live in Northern California and rosemary is a ubiquitous landscaping plant here so I have an endless free supply. I think it is prolific in other parts of the country too. You might add a little cumin or Tabasco sauce too. Serve with brown bread and a little parmesan cheese.   Black Bean Salad  You need: 1 can black beans, 1 can corn or frozen corn, 1 lime, ~2T fresh chopped cilantro, a fresh veggie (I like green pepper or tomato or avocado if you want to splurge). Add all ingredients to a tuper-wear and juice the lime. You might also add some chili powder or tobasco. Let it marinate together for at least 30 minutes. Eat with corn chips.   Pasta  You need: whole wheat pasta, jar of marinara sauce (I like Classicos selections), chopped frozen broccoli, parmesan cheese. I like to mix all these ingredients together but you could eat broccoli as a side dish.   Ramen Stir Fry  You need: 2 pack ramen noodles, green pepper, onion, 3 eggs, 2T roasted peanuts, stir-fry seasoning. Soak the ramen noodles in warm water while you prep other ingredients. Saut onion and green pepper. Add 3 eggs and scramble in the same pan as onion and green pepper but keeping the egg somewhat separate. Add the noodles and seasoning. I like to season with a sauce made from soy sauce, ginger, a little sesame oil, a little brown sugar, and quite a bit of lime juice.   Burritos  You need: Green pepper, onion, can of black beans, tortillas, cheese and salsa. Saut green pepper and onion. Add black beans and season with chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and lime juice. Serve on flour tortillas with cheese (I think grating is worth it) and salsa.   Fried Rice  You need: Rice, frozen peas, 2 eggs, onion, garlic, soy sauce, and ginger. I like to make rice ahead of time on the weekend and eat it several times. I usually cook rice in chicken bouillon for flavor. So saut onion and add frozen peas to defrost. Scramble eggs in same pan. Add rice, ginger, and garlic. Add soy sauce and some sesame oil to taste.   Curry Mushroom Chicken - You need: Cooked chicken breast or fake chicken (I like Quorn), frozen chopped broccoli, cream of mushroom soup, lemon juice, curry powder, shredded cheddar cheese. Defrost frozen items in microwave. Add a scoop of mushroom soup, ? T of curry powder, some lemon juice and shredded cheddar to the bowl and microwave again. You could eat with brown rice.   Baked potato  Baked potatoes are great because you can put so many things on top of them. Some of the thing I like to put on are Morningstar crumbles (fake hamburger meat), sauted mushrooms (season with Worcestershire), broccoli, salsa, shredded cheese, or black beans.   Salmon Cakes  You need: 1 can pink salmon, 1 can white/northern beans, lemon juice, dill or thyme, minced garlic, 1 egg. Mix all ingredients together mashing beans and salmon. Make into patties and fry in olive oil. Serve on brown bread and add a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream if you like.   Veggie Burgers  Buy a pack of frozen veggie burgers (Morning star veggie burgers will usually go on sale for about $.75/patty.) serve on wheat toast (b/c I dont like to buy special buns) with thinly sliced cheese and mustard.   Hot dogs  Depending on whether cheap or healthy is more important to me at the time, I will buy veggie hot dogs (healthy) or turkey hot dogs (cheap). We like eating them on whole wheat sandwich bread with sauerkraut and mustard. We usually have a can of baked beans on the side.   Heuvos Rancheros  You need: 4 eggs, flour tortillas, black beans, salsa, and shredded cheese. Scramble eggs. Warm tortillas in the microwave. Warm black beans sprinkled with lime juice, chili powder, and garlic powder in the microwave. Top tortillas with beans, egg, shredded cheese, and salsa.|`|GfyovDF5aa	Buy some lean chicken or turkey. Just grill it, and eat it with veggies and brown rice.  You can also eat fish, whole wheat pasta, turkey sandwiches|`|nYntQhBoaa	Breakfast:  Bowl of yogurt, and an apple, and maybe some other fruit    Lunch:  Turkey sandwich. Make sure to put some veggies on there too!    Dinner:  Chicken. Get the lean white meat. Cut it in strips, sautee it in olive oil, add salt and pepper. Cook until it is white all the way through, and no longer pink (even in the middle). And make a salad for the side. Use balsamic dressing, or any of the ones that aren't creamy.

Pimples may also crop up for genetic reasons. It is not clear how it can be inherited from ones parents, but studies do indicate a high occurrence of pimples in children whose parents had it,too.  The pimples associated with adolescence almost certainly occur because of hormonal changes that take place during puberty. Both males and females get an overdose of the male hormone testosterone during this period,causing excessive generation of sebaceous fluids that invariably cause pimples.    GIVEN BELOW ARE A FEW SIMPLE HOME REMEDIES TO FIGHT PIMPLES.    1.The most basic form of pimple prevention is hygiene and preventive skin care. Regular washing of the affected areas with mild soap is a must.The soap need not necessarily contain any chemicals designed to prevent pimples .However, face washing should not be overdone or the skin will become dehydrated .    2.Care should be taken on makeup,moisturizers and other skin care products.If these products are oil based,it would just make the problem worse. Use water based products instead.    3.Generally we rub, press or squeeze our pimples.Dont when we do this,we risk spreading the bacteria to other areas.    4.Lemon juice diluted in water can be applied externally because of its antiseptic  quality.    5.Tea Tree oil can also be applied directly to infected pores.    6.Vitamin A tablets are also a natural and effective cure. Vitamin A promotes healthy skin.    7.Before bathing, apply a mixture of fresh tomato pulp, honey and rose-water to your face and keep for twenty minutes before washing off.    8.Juice of raw papaya is the best treatment for pimples.Apply fresh juice of raw papaya on pimples and get a good result.    9.Directly rub potato slices all over the face, helps to get rid of blemishes and  pimple scar.    10.Drink plenty of water and vegetable or fruit juices.    11.Use cucumber or other fruit and vegetable packs to cure pimple scars.    12.Maintain a diet that is rich in cottage cheese, salads, fresh juices, fish and  yogurt.These help to cleanse your system and ward off pimples.    13.Another overnight home remedy for pimples is to put a dab of toothpaste on it to help dry it out. Calamine lotion also will have the same drying effect.    14.Pound orange peel with water and apply to affected areas.    15.Another useful remedy for pimples is zinc. Which can be taken in a dose of 50 mg daily for a month and then reduce the dose.    16.You can clean your skin with apple cider vinegar as an overnight home pimple remedy.    17.Aspirin contains Beta hydroxy acid which is a powerful defoliant ,so you can crush 1to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash.    Finally,certain medications may temporarily alter the hormonal changes prevalent during adolescence and cause pimple outbreaks. If this is the case, a simple adjustment in medication may be all that is required.      i hope this helps|`|UaKhSTwJaa	Try eating non-greasy food. That got rid of my acne in 7 weeks.

It makes your breath smell, makes your hair smell, makes your clothing smell and it's one of the worst things you can do for your health.  The longer you smoke, the harder it will be to quit.  Smoking puts you at greater risk for lung cancer, mouth cancer, throat cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and pancreatic cancer.  It damages your lungs, putting you at greater risk for pneumonia, emphysema and other lung diseases.  It also discolors your teeth, your fingertips, and prematurely ages your skin.

Its not a good outlook, so just quit. Its better on the whole.     There are far better things to spend your money/time on, so quit the sticks, and go and enjoy whats left of your school years without clogging up your lungs.    If you need support to stop smoking, you can always contact the NHS stop smoking helpline.|`|AA11795039	i can only answer with one word ....YES !!!

2WJgNLYtaa	Hey,    Sounds like you're only like 12 pounds away from your normal weight, so things aren't too bad, really! What you should do is calculate your basal metabolic rate - the number of calories your body burns each day just keeping you alive. To safely lose weight you should cut 500 calories a day from that amount, which will result in a weight loss of a pound a week. Ideally, eat 250 calories less and burn 250 calories through exercise on the cross trainer.     If you wanna do it a bit faster though, which I totally understand, then just make sure your cross trainer has a calorie count so you see how many calories you'd burn in 2 hours. It'll probably be more than 250. Make sure you're drinking lots of water throughout the day, too!     If you have any more questions lemme know! Good luck!|`|5nwDq07Uaa	You'd get freakin sick of it. Trust me. Alternate it with other types of exercise during the week. What I'd recommend is using free weights and a swiss ball. A good half an hour of concentrated weight training burns fat even after you've finished.. it also tones up areas quite nicely. If you're sore the next day, this means it's working! Do light cardio to loosen your muscles up and DON'T FORGET TO STRETCH BEFORE ANY EXERCISE!!! I can't stress that enough!    So if you have 4 days, do your cardio on Day 1 and 3 and your weights on Day 2 and 4.    Pick up some cheap dumbbells from your local store and check out the exercises at ivillage (url below) for some really great at home exercises.    Good luck!!|`|ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	It would really depend on exactly what you ate: ie the more fruti and veg the better. And also what level you worked on the machine- it is possible to do not a great deal of work at all.    I would advise you to go to your gym, see a fitness instructor and get a programme for a VARIETY of excercises- as doing the same thing over and over...your body will get used to it and what burns 100 calories this week may not burn anywhere near as much the following weeks.    I would advise interval training: work as hard and as fast as you can, get your heart rate up to 75% (209 - (0.9x your age) will give you your maximum, wich is 194.6 (to find out 75% multiply that final amount by) which gives 145.95 or 146) work at this level or get as close to it as you possibly can, for a good 2 or 3 minutes, then reduce and work at a lower level for 1 to 2 minutes short recovery at a heart rate of about 60% (heart rate 117) and repeat that whole thing for 30 minutes.    Change machine or type of excercise regularly- cross training is good, but wont work as well unless you mix it up with other stuff. Use the tredmill, the bike, run up hills, stairs. use the stairmaster, and if you can, do aerobics, try to aim for 3 sessions a week and work out for an hour each time. (not including shower time!!)    Don't just monitor your weight, monitor your dress size- measure yourself with a tape measure as mucles take up less space then fat and will still keep your weight up. Muscles will mean your body is burning more calories at its resting times (eg sleeping, sitting down...etc) so you really want to have as much muscle as you possibly can.|`|c8UxO6Z1aa	first, i dont know what stones are, but i think you could lose a bunch of weight, so go ahead!|`|4CkM4UZ5aa	it depends on your metabolic rate. some people can do extensive exercise daily and lose a couple of pounds a weeks.. some would lose similar in a month.  but if your active and eating correctly.. not being silly and cutting out key nutriences then you should hopefully be losing a couple of pounds a week..  im no expert though :P|`|nz8o3lLSaa	You would then weigh 9 stones and 4 pebbles or (for the Americans) 25 sticks and a 2 piles of leaves.

qA5i09U9aa	Yes, I actually just got back from a morning jog and im trying to be the same weight as you by june also and everything your doing s what im working on and I've already lost 5 pounds and 4 inches off my waist in 2 weeks. And Im happy so far.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	Let's say you need to burn 3700 calories of fat per pound lost.<br>  <br>  Whether you walk or jog 3 miles, you are burning approximately 400 calories of fat each time.  However you need to try to do all the miles at one time if possible because it will give your body time to kick in the fat burning metabolism into high gear.<br>  <br>  Low intensity distance helps lots (conversational pace).<br>  <br>  Walking helps too.... As you are toning as well you might want to focus somewhat on 'dress size' rather than weight as toned muscle weighs more than the fat it is replacing.<br>  <br>  You should be fine. But you may also want to change up your workouts somewhat -- throw some cycling or other types of classes to keep it interesting and to keep your metabolism off balance and constantly adapting. It burns cals faster that way.<br>  <br>  Impressive plan. Keep at it!|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	It should be pretty close.Your headed the right direction
jPxkg7vKaa	Well, it's all well and good that the Dr. says don't take anything that will bring headache back - of course she shouldn't!     Caffeine is a great source when reducing headaches and pain. Many hospitals urge their patients (at least my hosp. did) to drink Coke products after their procedures to help reduce inflammation and/or headaches.     Dim the light in the room, dim noise levels and get her comfortable. Give her some Excedrin extra strength and/or Excedrin tension. Both are GREAT for headaches. Naproxen sodium works well too and can be bought at any store OTC.|`|WIbSrkRmaa	My mom used to get really bad head aches too. Part of it has to do with inflammation. Inflammation can be brought down by lots of antioxidants. When my mom starts to get headaches now she take cold processed chocolate that is extremely high in antioxidants and they aren't nearly as bad.

You could get help from a therapist, I mean really, these things could seriously make your life better, don't feel weird, they are there to help, they know you probably feel weird and they want to help you stop it. So just go, it could really help. If you are having severe anxiety, you could try to get meds for that also.  I'm sorry, I just read your edit and I am VERY sorry for your loss. I know that is probably unbearable. You need to talk to someone about this, because, yeah, that probably has an awful lot to do with it.

Second, nothing is wrong with you, everyone is different and everyone suffers from different drawbacks in their life.    I was diagnosed with Severe Anxiety Disorder when I was 14.  Im now days away from my 19th birthday and can say that I no longer suffer from the disorder, I live with the knowledge that it is there but it isnt going to affect my daily life.  In the beginning I was almost a prisoner in my own home.  I would avoid social interactions of any kind or just pretty much daily life in it self.  They eventually started me on  xanex, which was the only medicine that helped out of about 5.  But I had anxiety that I would abuse it because at the time I had been abusing drugs somewhat.  Anyway, when I was home I read TONS of things about everything especially anxiety disorders.  I learned that people go through natural personality changes in your life due to chemical change, balances, etc.  But I say this.  Do not belittle yourself for seeking medical attention.  You deserve to help and you CAN go back to a normal life.      Let me ask you this, if you broke your leg would you be too proud to see a doctor then?
uOWgS7VWaa	it might me a anxiety attack. go to the drs just to be sure its not something serious. hope you feel better soon!!|`|W4c5Swk9aa	I think you should see a doctor if u haven't and if u have im sorry i dont know anything else|`|gkqmrIAGaa	It would probably be a good idea to go to the emergency room and have yourself checked out or immediately call your doctor.

2WjfwMOjaa	Two options,    For all the propaganda the Atkins receives it really does work and works well. Google this topic for the reason why it works so you can understand what is going on when u endulge in certain carbs.    Number 2 is a raw food diet. If you can handle it. This will work - Two meals a day.   meal 1- green smoothie for breakfast ( in a blender cold fitered water,ice,  hand full of greens, 1 piece of fruit so the greens are palatable, 1 scoop of protiein powder and one table spoon of flax/ cold pressed olive oil & if need be then add Stevia (online or health food store) Notice all your food groups are covered. I would take this in the morning with a vitamin pack    meal 2- large salad at dinner be very careful not to use the convential dressings or too much of them but use some cold pressed olive oil, (or flax seed oil) UNPROCESSED  salt which u can get online or heath food store and some lemon juice. or if you like mustard use some mustard for your dressing. I also would add a small amount of raw, unprocessed nuts for their omega 3 fats and proteins although despite what you will be told green leafy veggies in this sald will provide all ur essentail amino acids. Don't be concerned about healthy fats such as raw almonds and cold pressed oils or avacados.       Add 20 to 30 minutes of arobic exercise 4 days a week-- go slow if you have not done this in a while.    Last, Dr Nick Perricone MD has a three day diet that will work and help your face and body become less inflamed in a few days.

Just remember it is not healthy and once you lose the weight and start eating real food again the weight is going to come back and possibly double. You can also go on a low carb diet.   Try the Ultimate New York Body Plan by David Kirsch http://www.davidkirschwellness.com/ you can go on Barnes and Nobles and you can go on amazon.com and buy the book. It is supposed to get you to lose the most weight you can lose int he course of TWO WEEKS!!  I have the book myself. It gives you different workouts you need to do, along with pics of the workout and a description of the workout. Plus it will give you different foods you can and cannot eat. Its very detailed. It also gives you recipes in the end of the book that you can follow. Plus, it gives you different testimony's. Heidi Klum being one of them. David Kirsch is her trainer. I am not so sure if he is still her trainer but I do know at the time I bought the book he was her trainer and she says she lost her baby fat from her pregnancy very fast. If you can low carb it and you can follow the plan that is very precise it could work. This is the only book I can tell you about that can help you in two weeks. Don't expect a miracle though lol. It is a book that trainers want to sell.   Then you always got surgery.     Best Wishes!!
OTxCCXa5aa	Well, they can't just rupture, there has to be some kind of trauma to make this happen. My brother ruptured his spleen when he was in a car accident but like I said it doesn't 'just' happen!|`|AA10531094	A ruptured spleen is typically caused by a blow to the left upper abdomen or the left lower chest.

An injured spleen may rupture soon after the abdominal trauma or, in some cases, days or even weeks after the injury.|`|X40Ww89qaa	if you are too fat and lay on'em|`|p6CqbeQ5aa	A ruptured spleen is the result of some sort of trauma to the torso.  It has to be a fairly violent blow, and sometimes does not rupture until well after the accident.  Certain illnesses like mononucleosis can enlarge the spleen and make it very prone to rupture.  With mono, people have simply fallen and ruptured their spleen.|`|PoVODmciaa	well i know of one case. in some cases of glandular fever, the spleen will become enlarged. think of it as a balloon, it will get too big and be under too much pressure, so that it will combust/rupture.  extreme or rough exercise will encourage a spleen to rupture, provided it is at least mildly swollen.

qN6vYJiUaa	Okay, I don't techically suffer Bulimia. I have EDNOS. However I do binge/purge. Whatever you do don't scream at her etc. It will make it worse. Try to watch what she eats and if she eats a fair amount of food in a short period of time then disappears to the bathroom for a while follow her. Just stand within ear shot of the toilet and listen. If you can hear her purging then try sitting her down and talking to her about it. Don't be a complete control freak just ask her why she does it etc. This may be very hard for her though so be careful. If this doesn't help take her to the doctor to get her checked out. Tell her what will happen to her teeth body etc if she continues this sort of behaviour. This may or may not work though. I mean if my mum did it to me, it wouldn't help but she may not know. Tell her shes beautiful and doesn't need to loose weight if that is her aim (Bulimia generally results in weight loss) If all this fails try taking her to get treatment or see a professional for further help.|`|0WEGS1W8aa	As a former anorexic and bulimic, I can tell you that you definitely should avoid confronting or accusing her, as doing so will alienate her. You might want to seek the advice of a doctor or a psychologist before trying to talk to her. If you're not able to get through to her, take her to a professional. If that doesn't work, have her hospitalized. I wish my mom had done the same for me.    As you probably know, eating disorders can cause serious damage to the body.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

lj5jydHAaa	When you hold your breath, you deprive the cells in your body from receiving oxygen. It also causes an excess build up of carbon dioxide in your body (which is a "waste product" of cells). When this happens it hinders the cell's ability to function normally. Basically, from what you are doing now its not extremely dangerous, but i would advise you to be cautious because you can cause damage to all the organs of your body.|`|A5PhW8nraa	no its not dangerous well at least not to me it just makes my heart pump really hard then it skips a beat sometimes|`|5pszijaDaa	not really because before you can do too much damage to your body by trying to hold your breath for forever you will pass out and begin breathing again. just don't try holding your breath for too long in a tub...|`|ClQOqiBvaa	The thing about breathing is that it's done both conscious and unconsciously. If you consciously hold your breath, though, your brain will automatically override your conscious desire to hold your breath and send a signal to your lungs to start breathing again. If, for some reason, you were actually able to hold your breath to the point of passing out, the same thing would happen - your body would simply start breathing again.    I wouldn't think it dangerous, to be honest. Your body has several mechanisms to deal with too much/little carbon dioxide and oxygen so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Aside for overuse (heavy exercise, walking way more than normal) it could be varicose veins or blood clots.

Kl1h5dCaaa	I am strangely attracted to you right now.<br>  <br>  Um, can I come over??|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	Actually, I think you could lose weight, but you'd be malnourished and dehydrated. If I only had a few beers a day with a cup of fritos, I'd lose weight.<br>  <br>  Also, I have researched alcohol and weight gain, and studies have shown that women who drink alcohol in moderation tend to lose weight. That doesn't mean multiple sugary drinks.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I know this was a sarcastic question- not the way to lose weigh, but you'd basically be starving yourself if you actually did do this. Not a good idea, though. <br>  <br>  I have a better idea- beer and nothing but steamed veggies...there ya go!|`|TlLA1DVoaa	On only one beer and only one bag of Fritos a day, you probably would lose weight. <br>  <br>  Of course, your immune system would suffer from lack of vitamins...<br>  <br>  Your skin & hair's appearance would suffer from lack of nutrients...<br>  <br>  The beer would damage your liver...<br>  <br>  And you'd probably die if you ate just beer and fritos for three months. But you'd die skinnier ;)|`|nfzQkvqraa	I've tried this diet.  It runs in my family.  Except you should try doritos instead of Frito's.  Preferably cool ranch.  You can really put a lot of those down in one sitting.|`|1xJ3eC7caa	You should start seeing results in about 1 week. If you don't see results then you're not eating enough fritos. Make sure it isn't light beer that you're drinking either.|`|qA5i09U9aa	Well, A stupid question deserves a stupid answer I guess, so um im saying roughly about 15-45 pounds. Trust me it will work and you should start see the results in about maybe 1 week.

USoqyjaAaa	The important thing is that they not be given too early; later than scheduled is fine.  The hepatitis B series is usually given on day 0, and 1 and 6 months.  It can be accelerated to day 0, four weeks after the first dose and as early as 8 weeks after the second dose IF there are at least 16 weeks between dose 1 and 3.  So 5 1/2 months after the first dose is fine as long as there has been at least 8 weeks since the second dose.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Yes that's correct, you need three shots over 6 months, and no you don't need to be spot on with the timing, ie 5.5 months is fine.

There is absolutely nothing you can do to MAKE your voice change until puberty begins & changes begin to take place within your body.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn to complete development - and you are no exception.  The keyword here is PATIENCE.|`|aIEkNM0Paa	lol no just wait and i think that its normal for men not to start puberty in your age.. its normal..|`|O5s0lpGyaa	You cant....??...

Just wait.....|`|1x7Eonykaa	m8, i know everybody is guna say this, but,dont worry, it'll happen when it happens|`|EJSdI25Naa	Hello. Just relax. Puberty will jump on you one day very soon. There is nothing we can do to hurry it up, but it is programmed into your body, like everybody else.  Exciting, isn't it, getting the feeling that you are going to start to  become a grown-up man? And you are only 13. getting to be grown up doesn't just happen overnight, please realise. It will take you another five years. But that is fast enough once you start.    Being a man, a real man, involves being responsible, for yourself as well as others. Getting drunk, taking drugs, and driving like a hoon  are all signs of immature boys in a body that is too big for them. Don't, whatever you do, fall into the mistake of copying such oafish behaviour.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	give it a year

eMSP740Taa	Well, I actually had the paragard in for about 2 and a half years. I loved it. But then suddenly i began having sharp pains during my periods. Went to the doc and turns out that the paragard had misplaced itself. They told me that there was a chance i could be pregnant do to the fact that it hadn't been protecting me during the time that it was misplaced. It was kind of scary. But other than that i really really loved it and I'm actually planning on having it put back in in a couple days. But now im kind of worried that im going to be a little paranoid about the possibility of it being misplaced again. So....oh, and by the way, just to let you know, you have to have had at least one child to have and IUD place in your uterus. Just thought i'd make you aware of that in case you didn't know. Good Luck!! =]|`|BIg5bWkMaa	I had mine placed yesturday it was a fast simple procedure didnt even hurt.

94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	It depends on the vision center you go to, and which state you are in. For example, if you are a first time contact lens user in Vermont, an exam and fitting will cost around $150. ($150 Costco as of 2/24/09). If you already have contacts and just need a follow up exam (needed yearly) the cost is less.

I realize her and her mothers past history worry you but getting that upset about the situation is not good for you.I have had so many of imy mmediate family die due to cancer ive lost count,but most of them never smoked a day in thier life and were not around smokers either,so who knows why things happen.

I went through this with my dad, unfortunately with no luck whatsoever. And HIS dad had died of lung cancer in his 60's.<br>  <br>  It's so hard on you, I know. I also suggest you show her your post so she knows how much this is affecting you. Smoking is such a bad addiction, even people dying of lung cancer in the hospital will sneak cigarettes and smoke through their tracheostomies. <br>  <br>  Another medication that's been successful with smoking cessation is Wellbutrin (buproprion). If she'll try it.<br>  <br>  I hope she finds the strength to quit; it's completely up to her, you know. If she doesn't, don't blame yourself. I know you'll do whatever you can, but there's only so much you can do.

Let her see how much it upsets you. Don't be afraid to cry. Don't be afraid to bring up her mother (gently!). Tell her she's being dumb. Let her know that you feel angry, sad, betrayed. Remind her of the money she's wasting. Remind her of the health risks, to her AND you. Let her know that at the very least you INSIST she smoke outside, because you, at least, do not want to die.

X40Ww89qaa	stop freaking out--i think you need another pill|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Perhaps you are acting strangely, and don't realize it. I had a terrible problem with ativan making me very aggressive, and didn't figure it out for years. My (now) husband figured it out after a few months, that when I was coming off an ativan pill, I got really temperamental.  I had no idea how bad my behavior was. It's much better now.      Why don't you just ask your husband why he wants to know? It seems like there is unclear spousal communication going on here. My husband wants to know when I take meds, but I have bipolar disorder & have had bad reactions in the past, so he's been burned before.  I ask him if he remembered his afternoon anti-stroke pill pretty often - it's spouses taking care of each other & keeping track.    Hope you two get this all straightened out. Good luck!|`|gkqmrIAGaa	I would explain to him that it has become a habit that you take it at a certain time each day and that it would be difficult for you to have to also remember to tell him when you did. You do have to be diplomatic but actually it is none of his business, legally or for any other reason. You might want to ask him why he wants to know this. It sounds pretty strange to me. But he is your husband and you have to do it in the right way.|`|XzTa2Pw2aa	Your significant other may just be concerned about you, especially if you just started taking these pills. Just talk to him about it and reassure him that you wouldn't misuse them or OD on them. If you know you're not doing anything wrong, then don't worry about it.|`|06c0Gg5oaa	Maybe hes just concerned about you and perhaps has noticed you acting differently recently or something. If it really bothers you ask him about it     Hopes this helps :)
VCUc4k70aa	Hello there. I suggest that you should try cream/spray combo for eczema from Champori.com It is herbal (steroid-free) and works better and faster on my Dermatitis than anything else I tried: I haven't had a relapse for more than a year now after only a couple weeks of treatment.  Champori comes with the money back guarantee, so if it doesn't work - it's free.<br>  Best,<br>  Bernadette

vhvFNwz7aa	yes could be a sex addiction.  Actually people who suffer from it will never touch their partner but will go else where, and fillt he addiction with internet porn, movies etc.  <br>  <br>  As for libido, things like weight, age, diet, testosterone levels all effect this, (testosterone does decline with age starting in the 40's)<br>  <br>  My suggestion is get a BF as he probably has a GF (jk, i dont know that) but in time you will wanna find happiness in that area, and well.. things will change.  Or you both live out bein content with no sex life.  <br>  <br>  The sleeping in sepparate  bedrooms has nothing to do with his exam at the DR or sex drive, that's a choice.  Sounds odd to me.|`|a1pmr73vaa	night sweats|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Nothing is universal, but the sex drive of a 'normal' 47 year old is pretty high, least mine was at that age.You have to consider the possibility that he is gay. I know that sounds weird, but not totally out of the ball park.Chronic depression is also another possibility. Or, he's just totally lost interest in you as a sexual partner. More likely if he's cheating on you. Porn is a form of cheating. Almost certainly he's getting sexual relief thru masturbation. <br>  <br>  As to what to do, you can try counseling, just accept the situation, or divorce. Not likely he's gonna suddenly change. <br>  <br>  You're by no means alone in this predicament.
WxoZrTPlaa	Some guys are especially turned on by big women.  Have you ever heard about Feeders/Feedees or the 500 club?  This is a valid, though not very healthy, lifestyle choice.  You may have to rethink this relationship if it's not for you.  Like anything else, if you want it badly enough, you will find a way to do it.  In four hours, you could probably carve out a little time to exercise.  Stop eating all that junk food.  If you know you're going to be starving after work, bring a healthy meal along with you. <br>  <br>  I joined Weight Watchers a year ago.  I make healthier food choices, get up 45 minutes early to exercise, and have lost 75 pounds!  I still have a way to go, but am feeling better (and looking better) than I have in years!|`|AA11828439	First, stop blaming other people and the job. YOU ate all that crap, no one else!|`|U6C4Bywwaa	looks like your full of excuses, no offense. If you are up 4 hours before your job then thats 4 hours to cook healthy meals. So 2 hours preparing food for the week and an hour of exercise. Then you have one hour left to get ready and go to work. I know thats not what you want to do but you will have to if you want to lose weight. And just b/c your boyfriend brings you the sweets doesnt mean youhae to eat them. If you have no willpower then you will never lose wieght and if you dont stop now, it will only get worse? Good luck and if you need any tips feel free to email me?

vqtpF1Q5aa	You then need to go in and see your doctor and discuss all this open and honestly with him or her. It can be helped but I will tell you that *most antidepressant medications do take 4-6 weeks to - fully - begin working. You will feel a differnce with most of them in about 3-4 weeks but usually the full effect from the medication isn't in your system fully for the 4-6 weeks time period.<br>  <br>  This is the only way you are going to be able to get help with the depression or you could keep sinking further and further in it. I live with it daily so I know how you are feeling and I do take a antidepressant for it which helps greatly but they don't just start over night. <br>  <br>  It is very important you get the right treatment for depression as well. Not all anti's are for everyone and they do work in different ways. You cant's buy something at the store that will work you have to see your doctor and that is why I said - be as open about your feelings as you are on here today...............that is the only way he or she can help.<br>  <br>  You might end up taking something for a while because they aren't a 'quick fix' and if you stop it with out working your way down off it because you 'feel better' you are likely to fall back into a depression rather than keeping it level while on the medication....<br>  <br>  -- good luck & I hope this helps in some way --|`|vVh7ex7daa	You are looking for something that does not exist. There is no short temr solution to depression. Firstly realising you are feeling down a is a good start. But if you are expecting to be able to sort your problems over night you are going to struggle. You need to appreciate the length of time it will take to get you back on track. If you dont want medication (which i disapprove of mostly anyway) then there are some things you can do to help yourself. Counselling firstly is a huge help. If you are feeling like you are depressed-cant sleep/sleep too much, cant get out of bed int he morning, cant eat/over eating, thoughts of suicide, feeling worthless etc then counselling will definately help. Also exercise is one good way of lifting your mood because it releases good hormones that make you happy. You could write a list of all of the things you want to acheive by the end of the month (be realistic because if you put too much pressure on yourself and fail you will feel worse). You say little about what you feel maybe causing your depression so im going to assume things have just got a little on top of you? Try making time to spend on a hobby or do something with friends or family. A healthy diet is also key to feelings better. Try drinking less caffeine and more water and eat more fresh fruit and vegetable. This will give you more energy and will make you more motivated to do those tings you have to do.|`|h7uxxiZZaa	If it is really that bad(i am in the same boat) check yourself into a hospital for a while.it will help i have been in the hospital 4 times. its a break from life stress for a few days. it may not be fun but it does help to be around people that are going threw what you are.

Avoid sad music like the plague.<br>  <br>  When you try a new med, ask how long it should take before you notice it is helping. Then, call the doc and increase the dose. Then, if it isn't working, call the doc and change drugs. Stay on top of it - don't stay on a drug that isn't working for months and months.  Any particular antidepressant only works on like 10% of people, the rest of the people helped, it is placebo response. That's why you have to keep switching until you find one that works for YOU. What would help is if you know drugs that did or didn't work for immediate family members, since a lot of that is genetic.<br>  <br>  Try the free cognitive behavioral therapy program at moodgym.anu.edu.au and do the homework faithfully.<br>  <br>  Lower your expectations. You have a major illness. It takes time to recover.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Oh gosh, u sound very down 2 be honest, is it something to do with the job your in? I have found that if you are not happy in your job then it reflects on other parts of your life too.  You could ask your GP to refer you to have some Cognitive Behaviour therapy, I know a few people who have benefitted from it, it alters your way of thinking turning negatives into positives. Hope this helps!|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	You can go the chemical route with St John's Wort or the body chemical route with moderate exercise that raises your pulse to double what it is resting. The exercise will release endorphins in the body and you will feel a whole better straight away afterwards. Jogging is very good for clearing a foggy mind, I find. I don't think of the issues but I find after a good jog the answers are clear. You can also get the endorphin rush from sex, alone or with your partner or from chocolate. In my very 'umble opinion, jogging is the answer to most periods of 'the glums' ;-)|`|kTRcYaFcaa	I am sorry to tell you that there are NO quick fixes to despression - cures yes, but quick fixes no - and that is from someone who suffered for 13 years.<br>  <br>  You can learn how to find what is at the ROOT CAUSE of your problem - and this is KEY TO YOUR CURE - and then understand what it is you need to do to eradicate that problem and ensure it never returns.<br>  <br>  Anyone who tells you otherwise is either totally uninformed or deluding you. <br>  <br>  It is NOT difficult to manage the treatment, it just ain't easy - needs working on, each and every day until you are rid of it.<br>  <br>  Check out the site below and follow the links - this will point you in the right direction.

If after that time the diarrhea has abated, you can add bananas, rice, applesauce and plain toast in addition to the clear liquids x 24 hours.

vVh7ex7daa	Okay I would first of all reccomend asking to see a different doctor. Depression is a big deal and if your doctor cant even remember to refer you, you need to speak to someone better at their job. Secondly you are not alone, many people (including me) suffer from anxiety and depression throughout their life and it is amazing that you have tried to get help. That is the first step. CBT will help a great deal and in my opinion works better than tablets ( i am also a psychology studen/ex student mental health nurse). Whilst exercise does help with depression it is not the only thing you can do. Improving your diet may help and avoid unnatural additives in food. Try and eat as healthily as possible and drink plenty of water for energy. Find a hobby (if you feel up to it) or write a list of anything you feel is bothering you or thins you feel you need to do. Set yourself targets to give your life mroe prupose but be realistic because if you put too much on yourself you may fail and then feel worse. Try and find something youe njoy doing that doesnt take much effort and this may help lift your mood a little. Also keep a journal to vent feelings of frustration or sadness as this will also come in handy when you start CTB.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I'll give you my standard depression tips. Try the free computerized CBT at moodgym.anu.edu.au, in the meantime.  Also, get out with friends as much as you can, and see if they will go out on a walk with you so it goes better - any exercise is better than none.  See if there are some depression support groups around that you can join - some of those folks have dealt with depression for years & will have some great tips. Don't be discouraged that they still have depression, either - people with chronic problems are more likely to join support groups, but that doesn't mean you will necessarily get severe depression chronically, only some people do.<br>  ****<br>  If your depression is worse in winter, try to get more sun. You may have seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or your depression could be partly seasonal. Use a light box (10,000 Lux (light intensity) at about 20” - about $300 online, don't get at a local store, they  charge more, you don't need full spectrum, it needs a UV filter).  I have extra windows, spend time in bright rooms, painted the walls peach & yellow & have a skylight ( it helps!!!!!)<br>  <br>  Try meditation like progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery.  It reduces stress, & depression. See The Anxiety & Phobia Workbook by Edmund Bourne for examples.  Free 15 minute guided imagery download at healthjourneys.com.<br>  <br>  *****  #1 MOST HELPFUL  Go out with friends, & if you don't have any, join a club & MAKE yourself go until you look forward to it. “Isolating” makes depression worse.  <br>  <br>  Exercise 1/2 hour a day, & anytime you feel depressed. Exercise is a great mood stabilizer & reduces anxiety.<br>  <br>  Insomnia?: Go to bed & get up the same time each day, even weekends. Don't use your bedroom to watch TV, read or use the computer. Don't do stuff that revs you up before bed, like exercising & using the computer. Light from computer screens & TV wakes you up.  Use that last hour to wind down-Take a bath? Make the bedroom very dark, even cover up the alarm clock. Use a noise machine (makes wave sounds etc.) to cover up disturbing sounds. Avoid caffeine in afternoon & evening. Try soundsleeping.com for free relaxing sounds downloads.<br>  <br>  Put a lot of colorful, happy things around the house & let the sun in. Do nice things for yourself.  Make a list of things that make you happy.  On my list:  bread fresh from the oven, the scent of Jergen's cherry almond lotion, the crisp sound of a saltine cracker breaking, fresh sheets on the bed, standing in the boat flicking topwater lures onto the water, etc. Use all your senses & read that list when you are breaking down<br>  <br>  Work on time management if you are overwhelmed. Cut back on other responsibilities so you can spend more restorative time with friends & family.  Ask for help if depression makes it hard to keep up with chores.<br>  <br>  You got a significant other?  Extra physical touch is helpful. Many  people are touch deprived, so hold hands more, hug more, give shoulder rubs, etc.  A pet is great if your home situation allows you to get one. (Don't if you can't commit to it for 15 years)  <br>  <br>  Do NOT listen to sad music! It makes things worse!  Listen to upbeat stuff- same with movies & novels. <br>  <br>  DISTRACT yourself when you are hurting.  Read a novel, watch a comedy, go out with friends, play cards, play  a video game, whatever is mentally all-consuming. This is a VERY helpful tip!!<br>  <br>  Volunteer. Research shows that helping others makes you feel better about yourself. It also keeps you more involved in the community.  Many people find comfort being involved in religion.  Get help from your pastor.<br>  <br>  For chronic & severe depression, go to mentalhealthrecovery.com & order a $10 WRAP (Wellness & Recovery Action Plan) booklet – it helps you write up your own daily plan to maintain mental health & a checklist for a crisis.  Consider filling out a psychiatric advance directive to protect your rights & inform professionals about your care if you have a crisis. Links to your state's free PAD can be found at bazelon.org. <br>  <br>  If suicidal, find a community hospital with an inpatient behavioral health unit (check yellow pages) & go or have someone take you. Don't call 911 unless you have already hurt yourself, because if it is just psych symptoms, it isn't an ambulance that comes, it is the police, & they will take you to the closest place & that could be a horrible state hospital.<br>  <br>   I have severe psychiatric symptoms from bipolar disorder & PTSD & these things help me (I haven't found any meds to help me yet).  *Also, research shows that both pills & counseling are more effective than either alone.*  Take your pills every day without forgetting.  If your symptoms don't improve within 3 weeks or so, call the doctor for a med adjustment.  Cognitive Behavioral therapy is the most effective kind of counseling. Try free computerized CBT at moodgym.anu.edu.au.  Computerized therapy appears to be almost as effective as counseling, research shows.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	check your blood sugar.  try a vitamin c supplement.|`|kTRcYaFcaa	Check out the site below and follow the links if you want further info - hope it is some help - best of luck.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	That sucks and the whole exercise thing is such a load of nonsense.

VnLaUS3Jaa	what i would do to prevent boredom if i were you is to go ahead and walk all you can like to the market, but in addition to that, i would keep doing other things as well, but mix it up. variety is crucial to keeping up a fitness program.<br>  <br>  for example, take a class on monday, pop in a video on wednesday and jump on a mini trampoline on friday. then the next week go for a hike on monday, put on some music and dance on wednesday and go for a bike ride on friday. these different forms of exercise - in addition to all the walking you will be doing - will keep the boredom down and your fitness level up!<br>  <br>  as a trainer, i find that i must ask each client which they prefer: routine or variety. some people like to see how much better they can perform certain exercises week after week, so they like to stick with the same program for long periods of time. however, some clients can't hang in there without switching things up often.<br>  <br>  as long as you are moving, getting your heart rate up and breaking at least a mild sweat at least 3 days per week, your body is going to benefit from whatever you do!!

pIvN6TY7aa	I did quite a lot of research about tummy tucks because I lost a lot of weight suddenly (illness).<br>  <br>  To have a basic tummy tuck procedure in a Vancouver clinic, it would cost about $8,000.<br>  <br>  I'd thought it was just a matter of a 'nip and a tuck'. But it's much more serious and invasive surgery. It involves musculature as well as skin, and the recovery period is not easy or quick.  Unless you can also get some really good household help, taking care of five children under those circumstances sounds like a real nightmare!<br>  <br>  A tummy tuck is usually performed under deep sedation or general anaesthetic.  That may be the really important and significant limiting issue.  Ask your physicians and anaesthetist.<br>  <br>  Unless you're a lot older than you sound, your skin will tighten some just from its own resilience. <br>  <br>  If you're not seeing results from exercise 6 days a week, and you're not satisfied with the results, perhaps you're not doing the exercises that your body needs.  (I'd recommend Joyce Vedral's "Weight Training Made Easy". Exercises are reasonably easy, and progressively effective.) <br>  <br>  If your children are growing up well, and you're healthy and buff, tummy-wrinkles are just NOT IMPORTANT, and certainly not significant enough to put yourself at risk. <br>  <br>  If anyone tries to tell you different, it's THEM who has the problem, not you!
pvYy6iTSaa	Amanda K - There are a couple of possibilities.  It may be a muscle cramp if you exercise or run.  It could be the start of a small hernia near your groin.  It's not likely to be appendicitis or something worse if you have no fever or times in between with no pain.  If it continues another week, consider having your Dr check out the area where you have the cramp.
AA11146632	Go to your doctor immediately, it could be a sign if skin cancer.  Your doctor will know immediately whether it is anything worth worrying about. It may be an allergy, or eczema.  Get it seen to ASAP. It may be nothing, but better to be safe than sorry.

AA12266052	Chest pain is a major symptom of heart attack. However, some people may have little or no chest pain, especially the elderly and those with diabetes. This is called a silent heart attack.<br>  The pain may be felt in only one part of the body or move from your chest to your arms, shoulder, neck, teeth, jaw, belly area, or back.<br>  The pain can be severe or mild. It can feel like:<br>      * Squeezing or heavy pressure<br>      * A tight band around the chest<br>      * Something heavy sitting on your chest<br>      * Bad indigestion<br>  Pain usually lasts longer than 20 minutes. Rest and a medicine called nitroglycerine do not completely relieve the pain of a heart attack.<br>  Other symptoms of a heart attack include:<br>      * Shortness of breath<br>      * Nausea or vomiting<br>      * Anxiety<br>      * Cough<br>      * Fainting<br>      * Lightheadedness - dizziness<br>      * Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast)<br>      * Sweating, which may be extreme|`|8KTr8n3kaa	If you seriously think it may be a heart attack, you should go right to the doctor or ER. There is a possibility it could be gas but you shouldn't take any chances.
mLYCUkriaa	I tried it twice and I took around 600 mgs each time.    Nothing that strange happened.    Delsym has Dextromethorphan Polistirex instead of Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide.  That means, the DXM is time release, making the trip last longer.  However, since its slowly released, it takes longer to kick in and isnt as strong.    I suggest sticking with something like Robitussin Cough Gels or Vicks Formula 44 Dry Cough.  Those have pure Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide...the good ****.    Be careful, have fun.
AA10182327	One thing that helps, that you didn't mention, is washing your hands. Do you do this? How often? After you use the restroom? Well, lots of germs are spread by people touching things and then another person touches the same thing and scratches his/her eyes or nose or mouth. You help prevent or decrease the spread of those germs. So wash your hands frequently and definitely after you use the restroom. I even use the paper towel to open the door so my hands are clean. <br>  I keep wipes in my car and the anti-bacterial gel to reduce spreading germs from where I was (work, mall, restaurant, etc) to my home via my car.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|KOzYvMPsaa	Your immune system is forever screwed.

AA11664474	I have a demanding mother, too, but she's not this bad.  One thing you might try is every time she starts in on you for a while, tell her you've had enough and hang up on her.  Yeah, I know that's hard, but it's the same training you would give a bad child or pet.  Don't give them attention.  Tell her if she can't say something nice, she can't talk to you.  USE THE SAME TREATMENT ON YOUR FATHER AND RELATIVES.  <br>  <br>  You don't need to listen.  <br>  <br>  When you go to your mother's, make it clear that you will leave if she starts in.  You are there out of the goodness of your heart and if she wants your company, she needs to remember that.   Oh, and DO IT.  She starts in, pick up your car keys and leave. The first time you do that, she will be in total shock.  The second time, she'll make an effort to mind her tongue.   <br>  <br>  Tell your father you are not responsible for financial concerns for either him or your mother.  He has your permission to spend your inheritance.  <br>  <br>  The best way to modify behavior is to be firm about the bad and praise the good.  Your mother wants your attention and she is bad mouthing you because she thinks she should have more.  Since you know that's what she wants, that's what you can take away or give her.   When she does something you want her to repeat, tell her you appreciate it.  If you have a conversation that's good, tell her it was nice to talk about something new.  <br>  <br>  Now as to her boredom, there are programs she can join.  If she has a computer and internet, she can actually go out on Second Life and attend book readings, plays, and concerts without leaving her home.  She can visit a coffee shop (I recommend Mill Pond) and meet with other people--and she doesn't have to be old.  She can choose any appearance she wants.   <br>  <br>  If she doesn't have internet, there are programs at libraries and through senior centers.  <br>  <br>  One little nugget you might drop on her sometime is "You can choose to be bored and bitter or you can find something to do.  It's your choice."  <br>  <br>  As far as your boyfriend goes, she can quit ragging on him, too.  He might be more acceptable if he married you, but I doubt it.  <br>  <br>  Hmmmm.  One thing you can do if you both have cable is urge her to watch a particular movie that you are watching, too, and talk about that and not the guilt thing.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	you have to help yourself, stop blaming your parents for what you allow them to do to you, you are an adult, time to act like one.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	It sounds like your family is really dysfunctional, and you need to learn communication and coping skills to handle this challenging situation. I think counseling would help you a lot with this - I really do!  What you do is get the counselor familiar with the situation, then you work out communication strategies. One thing that really helped me was role playing with the counselor so when I actually had to face a person, I had a pretty good idea what to say and how to say it.  There are specific communications strategies that can be learned, too, and these are in communications books, like the broken record (just keep repeating yourself, maybe varying the words a bit, but the same message) etc. Also, you can learn to identify passive aggressive behaviors etc. and learn how to deal with them. I really think you need to make counseling a priority. She isn't going to change, your dad and other relatives aren't going to change, the only thing you can control is you.  I bet you will get some improved results pretty quickly from therapy, too, within a couple months.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Aaw hun what an awful situation you are in, I really feel for you. <br>  She is mentally unwell, and therefore you are quite within your rights to completely ignore anything negative she says about you, to you, or otherwise. Her comments should not be taken on face value. Nor are you her keeper, and it is wrong that others treat you this way. <br>  <br>  I know it's difficult because you're emotionally involved with her being your mother. I think it best if she did indeed spend longer periods of time in a nursing home, but that is not for you or your dad to pay - it should come out of any finances she has. I think now would be a good time to try and get power of attorney (but allow a solicitor to handle it, don't take that on board yourself as well!).  <br>  <br>  Does your mum have a social worker? If not contact social services as this situation is way out of hand.

Your father said "in sickness and in health, for better or for worse".<br>  <br>  You personally have no need to cough up any money, especially money you do not have.<br>  <br>  If her mental health is cause for concern, and your father's ability to cope, then maybe social services can suggest something to accommodate everyone concerned, such as a home help, or residential care.<br>  <br>  But you have to put your foot down with both of them.|`|oojO4WAraa	Wow, that is a very bad situation.

It is not your responsibility to give up your life at such a young age when it is making you so stressed to do so. Your father will be struggling to cope with his wife being this way also but it is not your fault. If you tell her doctor that you cannot cope they can make alternative arrangements for her if need be. If you are inthe UK she can be put into a care home that is free and she will be given care that way. I have worked as a psychiatric nurse and i have seen the devastating affect that caring for an ill relative can have. Its not good for you to feel this way, you need to get help now. You could also have counnselling for yourself to help feel better about all of this. You are not alone and if your mother cant take care of herself then the best thing for her is to have round the clock care in a home. You really need to tell someone that you are feeling this way and cant cope because its not for you to deal with if it is making your life hell. You are not financially respnsible for her either and if your father is implying that you need to pay then tell him firmly that you wont and cant afford htis. Stand up for your rights because no one else will. You need to get your life back. If doctors and nurses wont listen to you then you need to seperate yourself fromt he situation to prevent further damage to your own health. Tell your mother you love her but need some more time alone because you cant cope at the moment with the way she is beahving.

We have become very good at communicating with other family members and in the end have become better listeners.  We came to the conclusion that all souls are responsible for their actions and even though we may have been able to stop him if we had realized the enormity of his depression, in the end it happened and we needed to forgive him and ourselves.

It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

The abdominals are composed of 3 layers of muscles which slide over each other, torso twists help tone the transverse abdominis muscle tightening the love handles. While standing firmly with feet shoulder width apart, the torso twists gently to the left side then to the right while at the same time trying to limit the movement from the hips. During the movements the torso should always remain upright, there should be no bending involved. Care should also be taken not to twist too far as its easy to pull a muscle when exercising the love handles!|`|kXq90b09aa	Torso Twists can be very effective so are Leg Flutters and Twist Crunches. But most importantly, you should never forget that those are fats collected around your mid body and you need to cut down on food, increase your physical activities and exercise regularly to increase your metabolism to lose more calories. <br>  <br>  Determine your daily calorie allowance, eat less than that to get rid of the fat!|`|VZIPRJ3eaa	Your body needs a specific amount of calories every day to function.  This is called your BMI or Body Mass Index.  That will tell you the amount of calories you need for every day living... BEFORE doing any exercising.  It's just the normal amount of calories your body needs for breathing, walking, respiratory functions, etc...Charts and calculators to determine your BMI are easily found on most health and diet sites.   <br>   <br>  If you exercise too, you have to add the calories burned by that exercise your BMI total.

I don't care what kind, I just want to see the scale go down.<br>  2**)  I want to lose fat and only fat.  I don't want to lose muscle.  <br>  <br>  1*)  Losing weight is much easier than just losing fat, but for many people, this is still their primary goal.. especially very obese people.  They just want the scale to drop.  If that's your goal, I would strongly suggest the Weight Watchers diet over all other diets.  It's very effective, easy to do, and proven to be the best overall "lose weight" diet around, over all others.  It even won the "Diet Face-Off" at livestrong.com, when all weight loss diets were competing against each other. Read more here:  <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/diet-face-off/" rel="nofollow">http://www.livestrong.com/diet-face-off/</a> <br>  <br>  2**)  Losing fat only is much tougher, but..  it's the ideal way to lose weight.  Any time you lose weight, you can only lose muscle, fat or both (water too.. but that's not true weight).  With most "diets", you are going to lose as much muscle as fat, and usually more.  Losing "fat only" is what you want to do if you're trying to look the best you can for the pool this summer.  You definitely want to keep all the muscle you can.  Think about 2 guys.. both 5'11 and 180.  One has a belly with fat and the other, exact same height and weight, is ripped, with abs and looks like a walking anatomy chart.  His goal has been to lose fat.. not weight.  The best 2 diets for this are 'Body For Life' (<a href="http://bodyforlife.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://bodyforlife.com/)</a> and 'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' (<a href="http://www.burnthefat.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.burnthefat.com/).</a>  Both will yield results at burning fat only.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is the better of the two.. as it will even demonstrate how to add muscle while burning fat.. the true secret to getting "ripped"!  'Body For Life' can be found at any bookstore.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is available online only.  It's a 340 page pdf document created by bodybuilder Tom Venudo (who has only 4% bodyfat and is over 40 years old!).  They also have a great member site that you can join for $10 a month here:  <a href="http://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com</a> .  Tom answers your questions himself on that site.. instead of other sites that just give you a host of all the other members offering advice.  Both of the diets encourage the same.. eating 6 meals a day (females can opt for 5) and cardio several times a week.  Body For Life is a little more geared toward fat burning only though.  You won't gain much muscle.. but if you have  muscle already, you can rip up very nicely.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is the most work for sure, but will yield the most impressive results of any diet on the market today.  <br>  <br>  Why so many meals a day?  Your body needs a continual supply of glycogen for energy.  Eating every 3 hours, the food is digested and directed into cells requiring energy right then.  Once the cells have received all the energy they need, the body stores the extra glycogen in your muscles and liver.  However, there's only so mcuh glycogen your body can store.  Eating more than you should at any one meal makes extra glycogen now convert to fat.  This is why you have to know exactly how many calories you need every day.. and why it's so important to eat the right amount at every meal.  Remember.. 1 pound of fat, is just 3500 extra calories that your body stores.  It doesn't take long to put an extra 3500 calories in your body.  <br>  <br>  What if I eat a lot less so my body can't store the extra calories as fat?  Even worse.. your body is smart enough to realize that it doesn't have enough calories it needs for the day (your BMI) and to compensate, it slows down your metabolism, so it doesn't burn calories as fast.  And.. anytime your body is in this fasted state, it takes emergency precautions.  It tries to hang on to energy as long as possible, so it quits burning fat for energy altogether and starts tearing your muscles down for energy.  Muscle is anabolically active tissue, so this is the easiest place for your body to get needed energy.  If you do this day after day, you will become sluggish and tired from a slow metabolism and your body will lose most of its weight from muscle.  Some fat will get burned this way too.. but it's the last to go!  Your body will start breaking fat down last, after it has

FsA2c9ojaa	i am not sure. but i know that depression is a state of mind. in other words, we make ourselves believe there is nothing worth waking up for.  i used to be like that when i don't have things to keep me occupied. and believe me, living in a country where winter takes up so much of the year, and the darkness is all around you, it can be depressing.  i changed all that by empowering myself (ie. give myself the power) to change my life. i find things that excites me, whether it is to learn to draw, to write a story, to take up reading poetry and trying to write my own poetry. i also take up playing music. i don't try to be some rock star or anything, just learn to play nice quiet tunes. we have tons of it on the internet. you can find the chords, the lyrics, and you just play.  or you can be like my friend who took up gardening, planting flowers, or anything. even a little bonsai plant is wonderful to keep your mind alert . the trick here is to find something to make your life worth while.  don't just say, there is nothing to do. there is. if you think about people who live in poorer countries, without tv, or dolls, or video games,etc..  they find things to do too. they are seldom unhappy or depress.  they find things to do. little things mean a lot. whether it is something as simple as sitting in the garden watching starlings and sparrows, waking up early to hear birdsong or watch the sun rise. it makes a whole different world when you start to see things differently.  we all have the power to do that. you, and me. try it. i am sure you will succeed, and tomorrow, you won't even think about depression.  it will be forgotten. have fun, be happy. be yourself.|`|06c0Gg5oaa	I don't think there's an age limit to be diagnosed with depression as its an emotion. As for the drugs for it im not to sure but you should talk to your GP about it before anything. There may be other ways of coping with your depression if you haven't already tried.    Hopes this helps :)|`|DDkkwPcPaa	HI    I believe that there is an age limit for certain theoropies and drugs.  I am asuming that either yourself or someone else is suffering from depression    I believe that the key to diagnosis of depression is from the person whom is suffering from it, as I have mentioned to someone else on this site, that it is a positive reaction to human emotions, so I feel that you have to try and be positive about the illness in the first place.    People put depression on a negative key and try and put the sufferer down as an excuse not to do certain things, if you try and be as positive as you can, then this will help you to overcome these emotions.    Not every sufferer is the same, people's outlook on life whilst depressed can seem a little strange to other people, but perfect sense to the sufferer.    It is depending on the type of depression and severity of the depression as to what medication the sufferer is put on. and of course the age limit, health conditions etc..      Hope that this helps    Nick G|`|cr1cUCKVaa	anyone can be diagnosed it they have it. no age restrictions. any types of meds are approved for diff age group, the doc will give the best one they think is suitable for the patient.

Despite what another commenter said happened to him if taken correctly they aren't addictive and if you don't stop taking them abruptly there are no "withdrawal" effects.  Don't take the medication in the morning, but late afternoon might be the best time for you to take them.  Hang in there ;)

Then you would want to do pre-exhaustion which is to do your tris and shoulders first in order to make your chest muscles work harder and build faster because you will tire the other muscles out, forcing your chest to work harder....|`|VZIPRJ3eaa	Whenever working out, start with the largest muscles first and then end up with the smallest last.  Your order is correct.
12VQ4ETcaa	It depends partly on how your dentist describes the claim.<br>  <br>  I have a mouthguard, and it's my third one.  I chewed through the first two.  The last time I got a filling redone, I ate through it in two years and had to have it replaced with enamel.  I seem to remember I paid about $200 out of pocket, but the insurance covered the rest.<br>  <br>  The other thing we did was that I paid to have all my old mercury fillings replaced, and when my dentist did this, he leveled out the surfaces of my teeth so my bite matched up again.  I haven't ground my teeth in two years!<br>  <br>  Anyway, insurance companies will often reject a claim for a procedure the first couple times it is made.  You have to be prepared to fight with them if you want them to pay.  Or you can save up and pay for it, because it's definitely worth it to protect your teeth (and not get headaches from grinding so much).|`|PjyP8yEiaa	Usually insurances do not cover nightguards. In some extreme situations I have heard of the dentist writing a letter and even then they may or may not approve it. Its definitely something you will need because otherwise your teeth will start chipping away from the grinding. But my experience has been this is all out of pocket for patients. The only one who has covered it on one certain plan is metlife|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Probably not.  Insurance does not like to cover pre-existing conditions.  You will end up paying more to change insurance or get additional insurance than the cost of the night guard (none will cover the cost completely).<br>  <br>  You could try having the dentist call; it can't hurt.

A healthy body is going to produce different "styles" of bowel movements based on type of food eaten, activities that day, water intake, minor illness, etc.  In other words, some days you are going to have "normal" movements, and some days you are going to have "off" movements.  It happens.  You're okay.|`|EB1ECyZMaa	Yes it probably is your OCD :) !  You are 20 years old and there are no genetic abnormalities in your family. There are no reasons for you to be afraid to have a colorectal cancer. You have a good risk profile, you don't drink or smoke and you at least do some sports.    The fact that you do have an unhealthy diet does increase your risk to get a colorectal cancer but you can be quite sure that this will not happen before you are at least 30 or 40. Also remember that a polyp needs about 10 years to become a colorectal cancer which then has the symptoms you mentioned. So the polyp would have started to grow when you where about ten years old. Early symptoms of the polyp would be very black stool or even stool with blood in or on it.    There are several other reasons for the different bowel movements. The gastrointestinal tract is very sensitive to all kinds of stimuli. Have you had a lot of stress lately? Maybe because of this? Have you had enough sleep?

wRVdP5Ffaa	I would definitely see a doctor. The flu is terrible. I had the flu and my body ached so bad. I never went to a doctor though. I laid in bed for a week and took over the counter meds. I think what worked the best was tylenol flu day and night. They have pills for the day time that doesn't make you feel tired and then pills at night to help you sleep or you could do the liquid. If you want quicker results I would see a doctor. Make sure you are drinking lots of water and warm drinks help to like hot tea or hot cocoa. It loosens up the congestion a little. Good luck and I hope you get better.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	check your temperature, if it is less than 102, there isn't anything the ER will do for you other than give you tylenol and send you home with a big bill.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	Define "what seems like forever".  If you have had diarrhea for two to three days, especially if unaffected by over the counter remedies, then get to a doctor.  If you've been running a fever for over 4 days, then get to a doctor.  If nothing else, that will dehydrate you, which worsens your condition.<br>  <br>  If you can't get in to see a regular doctor quickly (or have minor emergency clinics nearby that take walk-ins), then you could get in line at the ER; but as a non-emergency case ("urgent" isn't "emergency") prepare to wait quite a long time --often 4-8 hours, depending on how busy the ER is -- while the emergency cases are taken ahead of you.|`|AA12227599	If you lived in another Country I would say yes, but since you live in America I would say don't waste your money. Unless you can afford 5-7 hundred dollars to be told there is no treatment for a virus. All they will say is get rest and drink lots of fluids. I would suggest trying the B.R.A.T diet. That is what I've always been told and I have 4 children ranging from 20 to 5. It is B bananas, R rice, A applesauce, and T toast. That will get rid of your diarrhea for sure. Also drink lots of water or Gatorade because diarrhea dehydrates your body and makes it hard to heal itself. Also take motrin for the headaches and body aches.<br>  (cool, huh ? and I don't even charge) lol|`|0BX8Lozkaa	Check with your doctor first~if they can't get you in soon try a local Urgent Care. They won't charge you as much as ER but they will treat you.  If you need to be hospitalized they will send you. Hope you feel better, make sure you see someone though if your flu doesn't lighten up in a day or two.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	I don't usually tell people to go to the pharmacy, but in your case I think it could be worthwhile. The pharmacist will know what is the best over the counter thing to take and they won't charge you for the advice.|`|n8Db77zbaa	you dont need the ER. You can go to the urgent care though.|`|WihNDnJyaa	I'd try a dr. before the ER.  Not sure what "forever" means but sometimes the cold and flu stuff can last a while.

These shampoos can be used 2 times a week. Shampoos with coal tar (some brand names: DHS Tar, Neutrogena T/Gel, Polytar) may be used 3 times a week. If you have dandruff, you might start by using one of these shampoos daily until your dandruff is controlled, and then use it 2 or 3 times a week. <br>  <br>  When you use a dandruff shampoo, rub the shampoo into your hair thoroughly and let it stay on your hair and scalp for at least 5 minutes before rinsing. This will give it time to work. <br>  <br>  If the shampoo alone doesn't help, your doctor might want you to use a prescription steroid lotion once or twice daily, in addition to the shampoo.|`|VCUc4k70aa	There are a number of alternative medicines for Seb. Derm. on the market, but you may need to try a few before finding something that works for you.  (with the exception of maybe steroidal medications; and those do more harm than good).

ZI50t4A9aa	With PCOS, you have increased levels of hormones, (cortisol, testosterone, etc) this is what contributes to the gain of weight mostly in the midsection.  It isn't actually swelling from cysts on the ovaries.  Actually your ovaries don't have cysts sitting on top of them, the cysts are encapsulated and layered.  These would have been the eggs releasing during ovulation, but don't and become trapped.  The best way to reduce the weight, monitor hormone levels and blood glucose.  Low fat diets with good protein and fiber and daily exercise that can burn calories and reduce the fat.  Metformin (glucophage) is a medication for Diabetes, and works wonders with patients with PCOS.  Most patients with PCOS also have insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome X.  It helps to low sugar (DM type II is a secondary illness for PCOS) and it helps to reduce weight, lower cholesterol levels and even testosterone.  This medication will ultimately regulate a period and even increase the chances of being able to become pregnant.  Alone or with another medication called Clomid.|`|afVOnMtaaa	I am not a doctor, but based on the website below which is lots of people with PCOS talking about their weight gain in the midsection it appears that it is a hormonal issue.  The androgen levels are higher in women with PCOS than in other women.<br>  <br>  Body Mass index and waist size are used to diagnose PCOS, but most of the women mention rolls on their stomach even when they are thin, that their stomach is disproportionate to their bodies, but that it is the outer layer of fat they are mentioning.<br>  <br>  The ovaries aren't very big and the cysts don't make them that much bigger as you can see from some pictures on the 4woman.gov site, so it's not the ovaries pushing out your belly.  And if that was the problem, instead of rolls of fat around the midsection, your belly would look to one degree more like that of a pregnant woman, than having fat on the belly...|`|QjGuVfH5aa	PTSD does.

AA11492002	Cherry juice - nice claim, extremely marginal at best. LOL.    It depends on how bad your gout is, and if you are depressed etc.     If you have a light case of gout; like it might be more than a year till a gout attack if you do not take the pills. If you can go vegetarian and not drink booze then you can likely do just fine without taking the medicine.    If you will have a gout attack within a few months or days of not taking the pills you need to take the pills.       Gout is a sign of reduced kidney function usually brought on by binge drinking or kidney poisoning at a younger age. Remember the one night in high school or college you got alcohol poisoning? Kidneys normally have a three time over capacity, gout is a sign your kidneys do not have room to spare.      The foods to avoid are shell fish, processed meats, alcohol other "rich" foods...  these foods make your kidneys work harder.      Also I recommend faking a gout attack and getting a prescription for predneson from your doctor. These pills can stop a gout attack if taken early enough... it is good to keep the pills at home just in case. Going to mexico for a refill on predneson is an option, if you live near by.      If your uric acid level is high, often you or your signficant other can smell it... time to take pills.       Gout is not a complicated condition to live with... you just need to make a lifestyle adjustment to live with the condition.|`|AA12225723	Quit eating rich spicy foods and drink lots and lots of water.

8l97DD8vaa	I was once on the same pill and the biggest side effect that I noticed was that it gave me a low libido which eventually ended my 2 year relationship but that's just a good laugh. But after they shoved a constant supply of anti-depressants down my throat they turned to a mood stabilizer called lamictol, its original use is a seizure medication but it works both ways and it worked well.     It not only worked well for me but another person I know. I've recommended people to ask their Doctors about that and so far so good. I would ask about the lamictol at least. I get no side effects except the fact that you get a long burst of happiness in which I really like.    The downside though is that it takes a month or two to find the correct dose for you and get the effects. In the end its worth it though because its the only pill that I've ever heard of that works so well.|`|H4UxIqe2aa	because you touch yourself at night!
AA11785060	Yep, though quite rare.  Lots of boys have heard their testicles "drop" at puberty and so think theirs haven't descended. They actually drop around birth, and only get larger at puberty, don't drop physically at all.   If there are two balls in the sac, there is not an undescended testicle. But only one, all the time, see a doctor if just entering puberty.  Balls can also retract fully in most guys, and therefore disappear from the scrotum temporarily, but that's no big deal, will fall back out or can be pushed out with a finger easily.|`|ynEdpoj8aa	The undescended testicle can be sterile because it is to close to the body and too warm.  With only one properly working testicle the sperm count can be low enough to qualify the person as sterile.  In animals, undescended testes are more likely to become cancerous.|`|Cy9mMf4gaa	That's what she says

paHjJrrdaa	She is way out of line.  She is causing you to have panic attacks and obviously this is not healthy for you.  Can you go live with an aunt or another relative? Are you old enough in your state to be imancipated?  I know in my state if you 16 you can imancipate yourself at that age. You'll just have to be responsible for yourself or find a shelter to live in or a roommate. It's really sad she is doing this to you.  Maybe she is scared she is loosing you?  Are you the oldest?  Your getting to the age where you don't really need her as much and I'm sure that is driving her nuts!  It's still no reason for her to act this way to you!  Maybe consider getting couceling together?  Tell her that you want to get help and you'll do it if she's there with you. THEN it will actuall flip and the counceler will tell her what she is doing wrong and how to improve. (Experience)  Good luck, I know it sucks!|`|Wb6l1nKEaa	can u give examples on what she has done to u? and how old you are?|`|iJrCZxy8aa	omgosh. im so sorry this is happening to you :(. Just let her know your feelings, and if you still dont see good results then go talk to someone, like a school counceler, a good friend. i really hope this helps!|`|AA11492002	Try and live with your dad?     If you are over 12 you can ask the court to live with your dad.     If this is not an option. Try living with an aunt or grandmother. However, you will find if your mum is an emotional abuser her mother is likely an emotional abuser as well.      Emotional abusers play a game of abuser then friends when they have gone to far. If you can somehow put your foot down firmly on your mum, your mum will get scared and stay in friendly mode.     Calling county child services on your mum is a good option just be upfront and honest. Make sure you contact county service the first time from a public phone and confirm the rules with them to avoid a big mess. If for some reason county workers do not respond as expected give yourself a nice bruise and claim physical abuse. Physical abuse is far less mentally damaging than emotional abuse. Abuse is abuse in any case and the county workers must act on physical abuse.|`|cf7e502388f77678bbc75e745e427e26aa	WOW!  First, call a crisis help line: 1-800-448-3000     This "numbness and shaking" CANNOT be healthy!! It sounds to me like you're holding too much in. You don't go out or get into oany real trouble - this is not really normal either - at your age you SHOULD be pushing at the boundaries (and making a few mistakes and crossing the boundaries a little at times). You're ALMOST an adult - if your freedoms and other important things arent given to you (or taught to you) then at this point I'd say that you're going to have to start taking them for your own!    In your predicament, I'd say you'd do well to start paying close attention to the difference between "guilt" and "shame".   "Guilt" is for something wrong that you could have controlled.  "Shame" is feeling 'guilty' about something you can't control or is not your responsibility.  The difference is extremely important!    Also, you're going to have to find a safe place deep inside of you that you know is pure and good. Find it, protect it, HONOR it, and reach out from there when it is safe.    EDIT: Oh yeah, I forgot about the man in the bush - talk to your neighbors and start a small-time (or big-time) neighborhood watch. Keep a camera handy so next time if you see him there you can get his pic. And get some mace (or a stun-gun, or even better, have the adult of the house get a gun!) There should be some free self-defense courses for girls and women around.|`|Pv6n2pGAaa	I dont want to be blunt, but be careful about what you say about your mother, don't make any hasty decisions, make sure she actually is abusing you. You only get one mother. Think about it and if you do think she is, then you should tell an adult or look up an abusing number.|`|eTwTcw1Waa	Maybe you should talk to your mother about how you feel.  Maybe you should tell social services.  Maybe you should get emancipated.  Maybe you should try harder,|`|64j0k4wTaa	Call a crisis hotline to help you make sense of what's going on and how to proceed or deal with your situation. (should be a listing in the phone book.. or get a number from the school's counselor). They can refer you to a nonprofit (meaning it'll be free for you) for treatment and guidance.  The other thing is keep a journal.  Record everything you're mom is doing and how you're feeling throughout the day.  The journal may later be used to help others understand exactly what's going on and how it's effecting you.    Either way, it sounds like you are depressed. It's excellent that you're talking to people.. and seeking help.  Make sure your school counselor knows the symptoms you described above.  (Sometimes those school counselors just have so much going on and aren't able to give the attention they want to to individual students. Don't take it personally. Just keep advocating for yourself.  Don't give up!)     BTW- the symptoms you described "numbness", "shaking".. I've experienced those feelings too.   1- you will get through this (I'm living example),  2- Keep trying to find help until a health professional is listening, and helping you overcome those shaky and numb feelings.. and helping you to deal with your mom.    Good luck to you!!!  (People do care and understand.... lots more than you may realize right now.)|`|qIcWac3Yaa	Hi,    What you have said definitely sounds like abuse.  It sounds like she's constantly criticising you, trying to make you believe there is something wrong with you -- and that is awful.  You have the right to be treated with respect, no matter what.    I would recommend that you go to the school counsellor again, and say about how you can't sleep, feel numb inside, feel sick all the time, cry at school, and feel alone.  These symptoms alone suggest that something is seriously wrong!  Perhaps you could also type out a list of things your mother does and read this list out the counsellor.    Please just keep going to the counsellor if you have no-one else to go to.  The fact that you keep going will show that you really need help.  Sometimes in life you have to just do the same thing over and over and over again before you finally succeed.  Do not be shy or too scared to do this, because it sounds like you really need help.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Mother is mother. Mother is special. Mother is respectable. You should try to bend. We are supposed to obey and respect elders. What is hidden in this episode is  unknown to me also. Ask God for not revealing the truth, as  to why such a thing is happening. Is your mother mentally fit? Anyway pray and take care.
u8CFwtyMaa	Probably a spelling mistake.  A phallus is a penis, or an object shaped like a penis.  Hope this helps|`|7LSonIoraa	You mean phallus. Phallus is another word for penis. In ancient greece it mean erect penis|`|QBUypAmAaa	Might you mean phallus?  And it's another word for penis, though slightly archaic and uncommonly used.  It's more or less an art term. Such as if there was a sculpture shaped like a penis, it would be referred to as a phallus or phallic.
YDykVkcmaa	Yes he can. As long as you have not caused an injury to your penis that prevents erection it is possible.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Hannah,    Yes hymenal ring refers to the hymen but that shouldn't stop you getting tampons in.    Do you use tampons with applicators? Do you hold your vagina open with one hand while inserting with the other? Do you get into a semi squat position?    If the answer is yes to all three questions, then the next question is are you inserting at the correct angle? It doesn't go straight up, you have to put it in as though you are aiming for the small of your back.    Try all these things and see if it helps.    Love Mel.X|`|513DGClraa	Hmmm, If your 'hymenal ring' is anything similar to your hyem then i would think it is further up your vagina.

w09AOQ4Baa	The most intelligent people are those who have the epiphany that the more one learns, the more one realizes there is yet so much more to learn.    I might also add that intelligence is both relative and capable of assuming many forms.   You certainly shine in your literary prowess.  Perhaps that is one of your forms.  To provide another example,  Einstein was a brilliant theorist, but, to be frank, I can sculpt better than he could.  Speaking of Einstein, you should know that he felt a sense of intellectual failure himself -- especially when he was working on his unified field theory.       I hope I was able to get some of my points across:    -  The truly intelligent know that they are lacking.  -  Intelligence is relative.  -  Intelligence takes many forms.|`|FoIxsunVaa	As a person who suffers greatly from envy, I sympathize with you. I am quote smart unquote and I have to tell you, intelligence is overrated. I know some extremely smart people and smart people are the dumbest people I know.

Every gift comes with a handicap.|`|y39iNwFjaa	From the way that you've expressed yourself here, I think you are very intelligent indeed and I'm surprised that your talents have not been uncovered yet. I'm a teacher with many years' experience so trust me when I tell you that. You are livid because you probably feel intensely frustrated as your intelligence has not yet been tapped into. Start believing that and act accordingly and you'll be amazed at the results. :)|`|yvDzvIbBaa	well, my last IQ score i ranked real high. almost enough to join mensa, but at school i was useless. i did nothing.    if you want to get smart you need to learn stuff, make the effort. go online and research stuff. you will soon get there.|`|SOveWKxkaa	You are driving yourself smart. Simple as that. Good luck and it sounds like you are well on your way. You are really underestimating yourself. Just reading your question is proof.|`|vA07XhcKaa	Several things here. First off, you have good expressive qualities which is the evidence of a person who is creative, therefor you can neither be boring nor stupid. Secondly because you are asking for help, shows you are smart because you are not just letting it eat you up inside. It seems your real problem is low self esteem. Not sure who or what caused this but you need to surround yourself with positive people. Also try reassuring yourself that you are smart and witty. Another thing, not everyone can be good at everything. I tried to do that and got overwhelmed. You cannot be the best guitar player, the best mechanic, the best cook etc all at once. Pick something you really enjoy and give it your best shot. If it doesn't work out, try something else until you hit the nail on the head. Lastly, stop telling yourself that you are not smart. Now smile .  PS: Try going into the Answer section and try your hand at helping others on here and you will see how smart you really are :)|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	On yahoo answers we can throw the BS around, heirs some more .

I've never been to collage or anything, but I wouldn't say I was stupid either.  I use to get frustrated sometimes because I felt I should have been smarter than I was.  I always enjoyed science, but some of the guys I hung around were like geniuses.  I found I learned a lot by reading books on any subject that interested me (I now spend a lot of time reading things on my laptop).  I also went out and tried things I'd never done before.

Look Back at your life--did anyone make you feel like **** when you were a kid or maybe still doing it?  I'm not kidding--this is a seriously BAD way to feel.  You seem VERY intelligent to me just from the words you used to write and in the manner you presented the question.  You have to learn to like yourself.  There's NO easy fix for your anger.    YOU are the only one who has to be comfortable in his own skin.  Don't drive people, friends and family away with your jealousy.  Be happy and content with who you are--NO ONE person is the same--That's what makes you unique.  If people love you and like you--they'll still be there no matter what.  BUT, If you're just being an insecure *** hole (no offense)--Then you do have a serious problem.  NO ONE wants to be around an ******--LOL  If you have friends who are treating you like ****--GET RID OF THEM!!  Be YOU and BE happy with that--So what if other people seem smarter than you--I bet you know alot of stuff too!  Take care and CHILL OUT!     Hope you feel better soon!

KG3MptIdaa	If you exercise 3 times a week to maintain your weight you should have a balance diet of 1,984 calories, to lose fat 1,191 - 1,587. If you don't exercise to maintain it's 1,732 to lose fat 1,120 - 1,385. (The more active you are the more calories you will need. 2,000 is an average between moderate & intense exercise for men & women.)    Not getting enough calories for your activity level can cause your body to go into starvation mode, it will store fat and turn muscle in to fat... The overall result: eating too few calories makes you get fatter! Your BMI will go up because of the lean muscle loss and your body will start storing more and more of what you eat as fat. And Diet Sodas are horrible for your body, diet anything actually. The chemicals in the diet substances give your body a harder time with processing and digesting. If you want a low calorie sweetner that Truvia stuff is great (I use it and it does not have a fake taste like splenda or sweet and low - plus it's from a plant not a chemical like the last two mentioned & won't screw with your digestion & absorption).    SO... Eat the right amount for your activity level & try to drink as much water as you can. You're 16, you need to make sure you take care of yourself now so you don't pay for it later in life!|`|eQdVqqddaa	it will work for you if you wanna look like a crackhead.|`|qPJPjrkNaa	no it's way too little! you gota eat! your not fat! so don't worry bout it|`|Tjr9aObNaa	No it isnt enough. for your height weight to maintain it you need 2000 A minimum amount of calories for anyone is 1200|`|266XxMZ8aa	wow. youre so fat. you need to eat like 2 calories a day. what are you thinking????!?!!?!!?!?!??????!!!!!!!!!?!...|`|nCjkx8qPaa	Leave the Junk alone....

Most doctors do not like us to go below 1500 calories when we are on a diet so 1000 is way to low. (Call your doctor and they can tell you if that few calories is safe for a 16 year old)     If you would eat a normal diet with protein, calcium, veggies, fruit and whole grain carbs and then do some simple excercises or just take a walk you will firm up your body as well as lose weight. (If it is to cold outside just walk around inside your house really fast several times each day)    Go to the FDA website and look at what our body requires each day.They also have safe diets listed if you are trying to diet.    We need plenty of vegetables and fruit in our diet so you need to change your eating habits. We need fruits and vegetables for the vitamins and minerals they provide, plus the bulk they provide for our colon to keep us from getting cancer and other intestional problems.    You need some type of protein every single day and if you don't get enough you will start to lose your hair, nails will thin out and other problems will occur. Calcium is important every single day also so you keep your bones and teeth strong.    Now about that diet coke, did you know that diet drinks make you hold water in your body which will make you weigh more?  Don't think that is a good idea to drink those.     We really need to drink 64 ounces of water a day. If you find it hard to drink that much just remember you can drink three 20 ounce bottles of water and you will have gotten 60 ounces in one day.   You might add about 2 ounces of grape, apple or mixed juice to your water to flavor it if you don't like to drink it plain.  This is the trick many mothers use to make sure their toddlers drink water each day.    Good luck and really your weight seems pretty good for someone your height.|`|2TiwAfPvaa	LOL ANOTHER?    what is it that you want?  attention?|`|ESSBrf2Xaa	1,000 calories is not too much but what your eating is not the right use of those calories  if you eat healthier or moderately healthier stuff you will get more for your calories and if you only consume what your currently consuming then you are being rele hard on your system|`|VDjRMkHkaa	That's not enough. About 2,000 calories.|`|deQNdDFgaa	women need at least 1200 cal a day..... you are still growing I wouldn t be so worried , just try to eat sinsibly
53b873dc19210bd9e4fae22faf08dc69aa	To me this does sound like you are depressed.  You really need to go talk to a doctor to get the proper diagnosis.  There is help out there be it medication, counseling or both.|`|2YdpqmQ7aa	It sounds like you are having a very rough time, you might want to talk to your parents about seeing someone for this.|`|cIh5EI3eaa	Go talk to someone..it may help uncover your true problem and if you need further help they can lead you in the right direction.|`|vVkJdq9naa	I have to say....You seem like me    So i decided to tell my freind everything!  Her answer to me was- Thats what i mean youve change with your whole suicide depression stuff!!!!Your music hair clothes!!-I was terribly sad that she knew i was reaching out for help and she just made me more sad.    Then i told her i did love her and her reply was...I love you 2  Promise me To not cry so often please    I promised  so the next day i got out of bed feeling greaT THEN I REPETED TO MY SELF just stop nothings wrong with you you over react and are beautiful and no need 2 hurt.    Now i do have some sad days but i have some weird thing were i like sadness :P    it helped so just tell yourself that and then put it all behind you
GMrtEYj6aa	you need to see a doctor is depression do it the soon as possible,aim on medication for depression and they really work.    good luck.|`|Ewosh9pTaa	I'm the same right now.  But I wasn't before, and I have belief in myself that I won't be in the future.  Yes: what you describe is classic Depression.  But ask yourself WHY you feel this way,  For me it's because I have no girlfriend, no job and no money at this moment (so who WOULDN'T feel depressed!)   Why do YOU feel depressed?  What can you actively do to make sure you don't feel like this for the next year?  That's the answer..........................|`|uOWgS7VWaa	go talk to your dr and let them know how your feeling. it will make you feel better and they will put you on meds. good luck
7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I'm having a really hard time trying to figure out what a Flex Fit hat has to do with Men's Health.  Can you enlighten me?|`|buLYCudWaa	It will stretch some after you where it awhile.    Been there.|`|qr39Z1Okaa	Remove the flex from it, insert a more elastic one in it.|`|ymZlFYn1aa	I don't know what FLEXFIT is but most materials... if you wet them you can put something inside them about the size of your head or a bit bigger and stretch it out.
AA11315360	Well there are no real long term studies on whitening products. So I would suggest NO do not whiten your teeth while pregnant. Dont risk the health of your child for slightly whiter teeth.  Teeth are not white naturally. Even the healthiest teeth are suppose to be off white/ ivory color.  The only whitening type product you can use right now, I would suggest, is whitening toothpastes. Such as Crest Prohealth toothpaste.|`|RxJzvUu7aa	i wouldn't do it.|`|AA10453678	you probably shouldn't. the teeth don't always go through pregnancy well. the body is taking all the calcium it gets and gives it directly to the baby, so there isn't any left over for strengthening the teeth and bones on you.
AA10358331	My husband has those too.. I really don't know what they are, but maybe its just because of the excess foreskin around the head. It doesn't hurt him and it doesn't hurt you so i really wouldn't worry about it.
Y4ogWjHOaa	It is just a period darling and it is fine but DO NOT wear a tampon during this period because you will be very raw and sore. just use pads this time.    Love mel.X
oVcY7Bynaa	well ask ur self "did i hit my nose by any chance?" or "did someone hit me in my nose?" lols  i dont think ur nose would just hurt out of no where   something musta happend|`|qWfw2af7aa	Maybe You have Some Internal Bruising or.  You Have Cracked A Bone    i Suggest You Go To A Doctor And Let Him Have A Look At It  or it Could Just Be A Bad Head Ache|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	Sometimes I hurt myself and have to really think back as to whether I ran into something, I usually realize what caused it after thinking back.  Do you think it's possible that you hit yourself in your sleep?  It is very possible it got bruised somehow.  If it doesn't feel better in around a week I would go to the doc.  Just try not to aggravate it in the meantime.|`|PhwOfrrgaa	do you have a cold? do you clean your nose with a Kleenex a lot? if any of your answers was yes than it might be scratch that you can't see. If you still have a cold or still wipe your nose than it may take longer to heal. Give it a little more time or buy a product that your doctor recommends|`|VDjRMkHkaa	Maybe its just bruised or sore. did you break your nose?|`|xAdOhtaoaa	i dont know. make you have a bruise on the bone. try going to the docters.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	pimple?|`|pTVxGebbaa	could be a pimple, could be an internal bruise or small broken bone. mine did the same, it was an internal bruise.
QsQj8jO7aa	If immunization built up and collected like water behind a dam, people would no longer get the flu. There have been flu vaccines for years but there hasn't been a related drop in the number of flu sicknesses.   I haven't gotten the flu vaccine since I started thinking for myself. I haven't gotten the flu in just as long either. Proper nutrition is the best way to prevent sickness. Me, my kid, my woman all live by these ideas, no sickness results despite the "unhealthy" things we do.    westonaprice.org  mercola.com|`|gSo4dR7oaa	No.  Each year, different strains of the flu (inactive) are included in the shot, according to whichever strains are expected to cause the most problems that year.|`|tZxVey2baa	No the shot usually takes effect in about two weeks after receiving it.It lasts usually through the flu season and protects you against the most common strains of influenza.|`|5iyeZFtHaa	No flu shot is ever the same, the virus mutates every year. The shot that you receive from the doctor is made using the virus from (lets just say) last year. Since the virus mutates and its never the same, the shot only protect some people and not all.
hvjWpq2naa	Its a plus in dance, but not Ballet. You need to control your muscles to make a straight leg. Lots of people have this, some extreme cases become contortionists, you don't want to do that. you will have to concentrate a lot more than some will on your positions, or build up strength to be sure your leg is straight.  your arms probably are the same at the elbow. Its what was called "double jointed"  you can train your way out of this if you try.|`|266XxMZ8aa	its when you bend your knees backwards past the point they are suppost to go. Its not a birth defect. Its just something that happens when you put your weight on it wrong. I think what your dance teaher ment was you have buckel knees. thats when your knees bend inward cuz of moving them the way theyre not suppost to go after years.
mBMpQKKJaa	during the day, when you stand up, gravity helps blood flow.|`|qbelhflAaa	The day, because I'm moving around alot.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	With the exception of the unbearably heavy beginning, I'm generally heavier during the day.  After the initial 24-48 hours of super heaviness (including at night), it slows down at night and sort of resumes during the day.|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	it just depends|`|513DGClraa	On the first night, i manage to soak a whole maxi pad up with blood:S I usually bleed more during the day after that one night though.|`|T5nZjBWfaa	for me its heavier at night. but the first 3 days or so it can be a bit heavy and then die off the next day or so.|`|xowgZUO0aa	in the day. at night its real light.|`|rP6EcECWaa	The day.|`|U53ha3gUaa	mainly the day cus ur stood up|`|dkXma0DFaa	both
s4vb9spDaa	If you are trying to lose weight. Yes!  It depands on how hard you workout and your diet.  Try working out 3-4 times a week|`|nkzwSX8qaa	Sounds good keep up the good work
VlLfwsRqaa	Sounds like agoraphobia and social phobia|`|oHP2DsfVaa	It sounds like it could be general anxiety problems.  Should see a professional, but a lot of times medications can make a big improvement.|`|WXExyAlWaa	This is like what I have, social phobia and tending towards agoraphobia. I can't stand talking on the telephone and rarely answer my cellphone. It is a bit easier if it is someone I know or my doctor's clinic, as I call them every 1-3 months to make an appointment and I'm more comfortable with it, but I find it extremely difficult to bring myself to ring strangers (and companies). When workmen come to my house I hide in my room so they don't see me.|`|ewHA9veraa	a phobia of some kind... wish i could be of more help but i dont really know sorry, you should ask a psychiatrist about that.
OcHJtS2Naa	You shouldn't use them for every meal, everyday - it's just not healthy.  I would recommend using them once a day for a meal replacement.  Good luck!|`|h9TEL6zHaa	Some people do use them as meal replacements.  You can go to their website or even on the can it tells you about the "slim fast diet".    It is possible. But you should be eating a balanced diet.  Good Luck!|`|EkrGID8gaa	Yes i do think it works. People do use them as meal replacements. 8 glasses of water through out the day works as well. Have you heard of Herbalife, i recommend that program for wait loss, it really does work. I lost 6 pounds in two weeks.
9pLdhuBnaa	They may be able to give medication to try and help deal with the inflammation that may be going on to irritate the tissue (an example only).    I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation now to see what they say.
Mm51QadRaa	Damn, fatty.|`|qMXk1GRgaa	wow what do u mean too much, thats not even enough for breakfast for me -.-|`|KlkUj6uFaa	I had:    Full English breakfast (sausage, eggs, beans, bacon, toast, tomato)    Turkey salad sandwich with mayo. Bag of crisps and a chocolate bar.    Chinese takeaway    Two chicken drumsticks, french bread, more mayo.    Six beers, 3 bags of Twiglets.    I'd say you might have over done it slightly, but not quite as much as me......|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	no, I don't think you ate too much...if anything...it might be too little..|`|TNNSHdypaa	That's my mid-afternoon snack.    Don't think like that, that's how anorexic people tend to think.|`|r8rykCkGaa	That's all you had for the whole day?  Not much!  You forgot the vegetables.|`|qpmGLd7laa	Go for 1500 Calories / day.  If you get fat, exercise.  You're going to die if you keep eating so little.  A baby couldn't make it on what you eat...|`|ec35c45458d391650124caccb1cab120aa	Stupid.

You are going to make yourself sick, and make it harder to keep a healthy body weight down the road. Chocolate is not a food group either. Add some healthy carbs, like whole grains, rice, lentils, ect. Get some veggies. Olive oil, garlic and sauteed broccoli is GOOD. Try it!|`|xthjbUg2aa	i hate 3 glasses of kool aid about 4 now   3 huge cups of coffe   5 serveings of chips  1 liver mush egg and cheese sandwhich  1 ham sand whitch   and just now 2 hamburgers =]    im not fat, but i just love to eat!    http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss65/...      and i got a high...i cant spell it lol metabalisuim..|`|1nIeHzofaa	Only if you weigh 20 pounds!  oatmeal is good, substitute soy milk for regular milk, apple is good, Granola bars are Ok depending on the fat content, skip the breakfast drink it has no substance.  Eat more vegetables (steamed).Sounds like your trying to lose weight.  Most of the time the amount of food isn't the issue, it's the type of food.  Eat filling foods such as whole grains and protein.|`|SNmmQRqBaa	there is no such thing as to much food.     heh heh heh.|`|EbEXx1Apaa	eat more... anorexic *****...|`|E2aN3ZBaaa	nah don't worry  as long as you don't keep eating that the same day  u are gonna be ok   trust me ;)|`|oEdgddQPaa	no way   is that it|`|eAxQxkA2aa	Is this a trick question?

Ha, you seem like your anorexic. Well we'll be sayin "I told ya so..." when your in the coffin from starvin yourself.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	No But I Did *Unbuttons Pants*|`|zanfEbhTaa	stfu anorexic  i ate four slices of pizza, one slice of cake, two bowls of soup  cereal and a muffin, eggs, two sandwiches...  dudee YOU ATE TOO LITTLE.|`|a8c3721d218891d4a3fb70f51dc29b23aa	OMG! u ate up all the food! idiot. go eat some more|`|vm5TgsQwaa	Anorexic|`|lTOeMNnraa	no    jesus you could eat more|`|fba450c791c2e5aa34640f936bd5aad7aa	RATHER SEE YOU JOG AFTER A GOOD MEAL THAN STARVE YOURSELF....|`|dd242da77f64ad0e25bb846806bd953caa	This isn't a balanced meal at all.|`|jfiF9XIUaa	Please eat some more thats not cute at all sweetheart.|`|SpkWCvupaa	NO! that is extremely little. you need to eat some more or you're going to be anorexic soon. Eating is essential; it's something we all need to do. You can't just neglect yourself like that. And, don't care about what others think about your weight. Eat more!!|`|vT0dCPIIaa	um.. NO U DID NOT!! oatmeal is very healthy.   two glasses of choco milk is fatty, but its sounds okay with the rest  an apple a day keeps the doctor away!   the chunk bars were lowfat,so no problem there.  i have never heard of the last thing, but with the rest, u should be good.|`|KPYQwyeraa	OMG thats so much food you might wanna make yourself vomit before it all turns to fat hurry go go go    get over yourself|`|bSQgVqtiaa	Probably not enough for growing bones like yours.Try eating another apple tommorrow and maybe some canned fish for protein??|`|EPDi4Z1Iaa	not at all. infact i think you should eat more. it seems like you had breakfast and some snacks.|`|QUCIdBp5aa	No, you didn't eat enough.      If you don't want to get fat, have 4 - 5 small, balanced meals per day with a lean protein and quality carb at each meal.    What you're eating now?  You may show lost weight on the scale, but you're also losing muscle, which screws with your metabolism, so by the time you're 25 you probably will be fat.  Start healthy habits now so you don't have to work so hard to reverse this when you're older.|`|1vFrenKoaa	Try not enough!|`|ohi0kM6Raa	no f'in way?  what are you thinking?  those are good things to eat but where are the vegetables?    carnation breakfast drink for dinner?  are you crazy?  get some real food in you, get your parents to cook something.      eat more, like 500 calories at least a day sweetheart.|`|JjdMvFN1aa	it sounds like you are doing good but bad also. If you eat more foods you should be fine.  and dont listen to anyone who is calling you anorexic, just be yourself and if you feel like you are not getting enough foods call your mom or a doctor.|`|yuT6tqXraa	well it depends,if you ate when you were hungry and only ate enough to satisfy your hunger that you ate just enough,if you ate even if you were not hungry then you did,but if you ate and still felt hungry then you didnt eat enough,like for me,that would be enough food to get me through the day,but for my much bigger(military) brother,that would just be breakfast|`|OfGSF2vmaa	Oatmeal  2 glasses of chocolate milk.  Apple.  2 low-fat chocolate chunk granola bars.  Carnation instant breakfast drink (dinner) ??    Uhm, First of all, you didnt eat enough.  Secondly, your "meals" are not good enough.  Those are snack foods with the exception of Oatmeal.     If your trying to lose weight, do it the smart way and do be stupid about it.     Under eating slows down your metabolism, which will make you fatter, so your not helping your self.  Your just slowing down your metabolism and having malnutrition.   A person needs a certain amount of Calories, Fats, Carbs, and Fiber.  Yes, I said Fats and Carbs. There are "Good Fats/ Carbs" and "Bad Fats/ Carbs"|`|mfwNdPGXaa	Well, it sounds like you ate plenty of food, but perhaps are lacking in the "need for attention" department. Maybe counseling or some sort of social group might be best for you. Good luck!|`|2YowgtIJaa	no that is pretty normal and good to see that your eating healthy but don't starve your self you could get very sick and end up in the hospital  than you will regret every thing........... and don't eat over 1600 calories a day that's the limit..... (don't go hungry!)  :]|`|99cTefxaaa	That's probably too little!  You def can eat a lot more than that.|`|NB42ZXSKaa	I had today (no joke)    A BLT Sandwich (440 cals)  Twix Choc Bar (282 cals)  4 x Coffees (60cals?)

Are you serious? You ate what, 400 calories worth of food today? And you think you ate too much?|`|X64drAmraa	lol ur trying to starve yourself...don't|`|f3c6506505c21cdb2337cc85bae22c4caa	No you anorexic wanna be.

Tha'ts what I chose down at lunch and a snack|`|xu3xDkYWaa	not at all, you didn't eat enough.      you should try to eat a regular meal.    esp. if your trying to be healthy.|`|cIh5EI3eaa	Umm no your good....try drinking more water though...fruit is good at any time but you need some protein|`|EcVVcgZNaa	In my opinion, you didn't eat enough...  you need proteins, and other nourishment too.  if you think that is too much, you have some problems...  Don't starve yourself, that's the worst thing you can do. When you starve yourself, you start to lose your hair, your skin becomes pale and you start to see your bones. You might end up with heart disease and kidney problems. Just Don't. If you are struggling with self image, go talk to someone who can maybe help. Sorry, for all the rude and mean answers on here.  Additional:  If you are trying to lose weight, do it the right way, exercise and eat plenty of the good stuff, but don't starve yourself.|`|04qt7YxBaa	Eat only when your hungry, don't eat when your not.

You definately need to eat more.  If you're worried about it being healthy, try some grilled chicken and vegetables for a real dinner.|`|H7Q1rA7jaa	no but omg i love carnation milkshakes they are so good|`|YffWfSa5aa	hunny, you have to eat MORE, but who knows, you night be really fat, and just trying to show off.|`|3VLvEeRUaa	Okay all you want is attention. Shut-up.|`|OMuyhd2Eaa	I think you ate way too little. As long as you feel fine filled with energy go ahead and eat that little.  You probably should think about going more on a diet where you eat 6  tiny meals a day, you'll be more full by the end of the day and your metabolism will speed up to help you loose weight. And chocolate is not a very smart choice if you're trying to loose weight.|`|KJCHUVe5aa	I know where your coming form, dont listen to people who say you are anerexic just fill your self up with fruit and veggies and eat dinner if you are going to skip lunch! :)|`|pnQRTDU4aa	That really isn't enough food. I hope you are taking some sort of multivitamin, because you are not going to get all of the stuff you need in your diet.I would advise you to go see a dietitian before you get an eating disorder. Just posting this question means that you are on the brink of one right now.
ZT9Zap0faa	You probably had a cold sore and with all of your daily activities, such as eating, drinking, etc., you slit it. So now, it's just open skin. The person that told you to gargle with salt water is an idiot, a total moron. Don't do that, you'll burn your mouth even more, and possibly open yourself up to infection. Just drink a glass of warm water, every day. This will clean out the area, gently, and take you away from getting infections. Also, brush your teeth everyday. The whole mouth is clean, also keeping you from burning the open sore and extra other pain. Salt granules rub up against the open sore, causing extra itchiness and burning.|`|bc6MlMyoaa	You've got a canker sore.   The salt-water trick works best with very high concentrations of salt (I usually just apply salt directly to it....but be careful, it hurts.)  Anyway, while I've found that the salt will help if go   away a day or two earlier, they usually last about a week.  Best way to deal with them is to not get them; they tend to occur when you don't get enough sleep.|`|sLEoWYr5aa	It's an ulcer, pain in the neck I must admit but they will go eventually.

Good luck :[ I know your pain|`|Ekra9yrhaa	Hi it sounds like a cist. its a red spot in ur mouth with a white head and it stings. you should go and get bongella. it will sooth it. and ur friend is right about the salt water. it will disinfect it. and it will heal quicker. try not to play with it as it will take longer to heal, and also, when applying any creams wash your hands and infection may cause more damage.    hope bonjella works for you.|`|2w5GMHhsaa	cut it off reeeaaalll slow with a ruler|`|ww3ukbdVaa	ummm thats like inflammation. you should just leave it or else it will get worse.|`|pLlcEQOIaa	it is probally a cold sore|`|pSpWOsiQaa	ohhhhh mannn dude those fucken hurt... in spanish there called "PELADAS".. there isnt anything you can do.. itll go away in a couple of days.|`|Jio3d8bYaa	I say you should go see a doctor.

sQu3LLqtaa	A vegan diet is very healthy if you do it right.    To get your complete protein in adequate amounts you need to combine bread, cereals, pasta, rice or nuts with beans, peas or lentils.  This is known as protein complementing.    To ensure that you are doing it right you need to be aware of the traps in a vegan diet that you can find in a web search for vegan + "health hazards".|`|kmwZnASgaa	its cool, but i think ur gonna need to get supplements to make up for vitamins in meat|`|5pszijaDaa	just make sure you are getting all of the amino acids (proteins) you need. some amino acids that are readily availble in meats are very rare in plants. you will need to eat the right combination of food to get these amino acids. i would recommend you see a nutritionist to help you ensure you are getting all the nutrients you need.|`|c88406c33ed216877628e7bfcb6d5c27aa	I'm not an expert, but I think it would be good for you.

LGidAYDwaa	Yep. Go ahead and go. Your cousin might need a tetanus booster (the dog's vaccinations do not mean it does not have some nasty bacteria going on in his mouth), plus your cousin might need a stitch or two. It at least needs to be cleaned well by a professional and your cousin will likely be taught how to clean it himself.  If he needs stitches, they can do that right away.  Dog bites aren't something you should handle on your own.|`|ynEdpoj8aa	He should be looked over by a doctor to make sure there isn't any damage you can't see and doesn't require stitches.  If you can bring proof of the dog's rabies shot, so they don't have to worry about your cousin getting rabies.  If you can't find the certificate, you can tell them the dog is up to date and prove the vaccinations later...

TCpTlCTRaa	Using aromatherapy scalp massage formulas made with essential oils such as peppermint, tea tree and others will provide great relief from itchiness and flakiness caused by dandruff.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Apple Cider vinegar added to the final rinsing water after shampooing  helps to prevent dandruff. More simple remedies for dandruff at http://usefulinfo-dandruff.blogspot.com/|`|emNCaAq7aa	Most, not all, of the time dandruff is caused by a type of fungal infection. Selsun Blue an Head and Shoulders both have a zinc substance that usually helps. You have to leave the shampoo on for about 5 minutes before rinsing. After drying you will have old flakes that show up. Brush them out.  You can also try using tea tree oil shampoo that is fortified by you with ten drops of 100% tea tree oil. Again let it sit for 5 minutes.  You might have a different problem with dry skin, do you get  that chalky look on your arms?  Try this, with your scalp still moist after the shampoo rub in coconut oil. The natural kind available at health food stores, use just a little and do it every day when the scalp is moist. It is a conditioner and it helps the skin stay moist and it has its own anti fungal/bacteria properties.|`|At2JL4MVaa	when you wash your hair, you really really have to scrub your scalp with your fingernails.|`|AA10358331	Its possible that you have eczema in your scalp that's causing the flakes. I had bad dandruff when I was around 12, turned out that's what I had. I had to use a special shampoo to get rid of it. I would suggest seeing a dermatologist to see what they think.      It may also be that you are getting all the soap out of your hair. Because your hair is thick and curly. Try using cooler water and a harder stream with the shower. You may have to cut your hair to help the scalp to heal. (My brother had this problem with his hair)|`|0n2OVY7Maa	Your best bet now is to get rid of all those drugstore shampoos. I had the same problem before and no shampoo was able to fix it. So finally I got sick of it and wash my hair with honey locust. I just fry the pods then boil them. It's a Vietnamese traditional shampoo. Not sure you can get it where you are though. But you can try other natural remedies. Some of my friends told me about using papaya but I don't know how to make it into a shampoo. But I honestly think that washing your hair with just water is much better than hurting your scalp with all those chemicals.|`|hpb1i0t5aa	Have you considered psoriasis.?About two per cent of the UK population have it. Its not serious and can be treated. I would suggest mybe cut your hair a bit and continue with the head and shoulders for a couple of weeks the if thats hasnt worked seek medical advise.Hope thats helped a bit.|`|fV5BQK6xaa	Go to your dermatologist and ask for a prescription  dandruff isn't anything serious it's just dead skin cells from your scalp as long as your wash your hair your scalp is clean weather dandruff is present or not besides that 70% of the US population have dandruff problems. Dandruff is not infectious, and is not a sign of bad hygiene or unkempt hair. It is more of a cosmetic problem than a medical problem.

5dRvtaGgaa	It sounds like you broke it.  I've broken every toe on both feet (I'm a clutz).  Going to the doctor won't help you because there's nothing they can do.  Get some white tape for the skin (sorry, can't remember what it's called) and wrap your pinky toe with the next two toes.  That will keep it stable and let it heal.  That's all the doctor would do anyway.  Breaking a toe has always made me fall to my knees it hurts so bad.  I feel for you.  Get better soon.|`|8aQiTF6baa	I say...if when you smacked it and you didn't immediately puke or at least feel like you were going to...it's not broke!

If not, it's not broken.|`|cb422b6c3f9c9f2317116c9a1fcfe7d7aa	X-ray is the only sure way to know but there is nothing that can be done about it anyway.  Sorry.  Might not be much there to break either.  Just keep taking care if it--and try not to hit it or injure it more.  Good Luck.
e925cdc40443ac843a498bc0553ecc4aaa	I do believe this is a case of ultra dry skin. Some people just have uber-sensitive skin...especially when it comes to dryness. My boyfriend has the same EXACT problem except he gets it on both hands AND his stomach. It happens to him every winter when his skin gets super dry. I would HIGHLY suggest drinking lots of water (helps keep skin hydrated), washing hands in mild but moisturizing soap with lukewarm water and daily use of Eucerin Calming Creme or that new Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy lotion. It is best applied right after showering. We've used both lotions on him & it helps a TON!! A friend's S-I-L is also a nurse who has to wash her hands constantly causing them to get dry & cracked & she swears by the Eucerin Calming Creme. I hope this helped some :o)|`|KLDo66Ecaa	Could be eczema or psoriasis.  My father has psoriasis but it never looks as bad as the pics only.  It just looks like really bad chapped hands.|`|P0RWV9Unaa	put vaseline on your hands at night|`|0MunIx8raa	It sounds like severely dry skin.  My hands are like this too.  During the winter months it gets really bad.  When you wash your hands, don't use hot water.  Use moisturizing soap and cool water.  The friction is what kills the germs.  I wash my hands so much that it's hard to keep lotion on them.  Get yourself some Eucerin lotion or something that says for severely dry skin and keep it on your hands.  It will sting at first b/c your skin is so dry.  Red bumps may even pop up after putting on the lotion, again b/c your skin is so dry.  Just keep putting it on.  Every time you wash your hands or bathe, put the lotion on.    Add: I live in GA, but my hands are awfully dry.  I wash my hands a whole lot and keep lotion on them the best I can, but yet they are still dry and cracking and bleed.  Something about the winter air does it for me.  I hate it.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	try hand lotion then a doctor|`|v2ZBawa7aa	Do you work in healthcare and have to use gloves?  It sounds like it could be a reaction to latex or the powder used in disposable gloves.  Also, if you live somewhere very cold, the cold environment can cause dry skin on your hands.  What concerns me the most, though, is the wound that got infected.  Fortunately it ended up healing, but if you get one again that turns green or yellow you need to go see the doctor.  I would suggest using Burt's Bees almond milk hand creme.  It's what I use on my hands and it's the best thing I've ever found.  I have problems with my hands because of working in healthcare and having to wash my hands all the time and using gloves too.|`|wr10vJgBaa	it could possibly be an extreme case of eczema. Eczema is a syndrome of inflammatory skin reaction most often characterized by itching, redness, blister, or dryness. there are certain lotions and products to get rid of it.

HA2IV3r3aa	Well, it's not a matter of belief: some people do have "higher" metabolisms than other people.  There are three basic body types: ectomorphs, endomorphs, and mesomorphs.    Ectomorphs: Probably what you are, just a naturally skinny person.  Endomorphs: Someone who gains fat easily and is prone to being big.  Mesomorphs: The in-betweens.  Hour-glass figures in girls, more powerful muscly figures for men.  It isn't as simple as just a "high" metabolism, but you probably do have an ectomorph body type.|`|KjF0p72naa	It's proven so.

It was used to induce sleep because of its sedative effect however because of the side effects it causes, it is not used anymore for this purpose.    You may use other alternative medications to go to sleep, which will not have major side effects.
2QS8j9aOaa	You are still feeling depressed because that feeling in your throat is when you want to cry and suppress it. Talk to someone about that relationship and get it off your chest and it's okay to cry, you lost someone that was really important to you. The problem you have is when boy's are little they train them to not cry when you get hurt, so therefore might hold those feeling in because of this taboo. I lost a baby and my husband wouldn't cry and I thought that he didn't care, but the counselor told me what I'm telling you that little boys are taught to not cry. So its hard to show their emotions, I got thru that depression and you can too.

Here's a site that might help with some remedies:    http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/diarrhe...    Read the page and also click on Turmeric - I think I read that half a tsp of turmeric in a glass of water - repeated once a day for 2 or three days -- is very effective.  There a bunch of testimonials that seem to support this cure.      Also, be careful about what you eat - stick to toast, tea, apple sauce and crackers.  Cardamom pods are also pretty helpful, but you may not have them at home.       If it's bacterial, you'll need some medicine - I would go to the doctor to ensure that it doesn't repeat.    Get lots of rest - hope you're healthy in no time at all!    :)|`|8Y583Fluaa	it sure does make u feel like your dying or u want to die...i hope u feel better...keep with ginger ale and try some bread...get better...also try to sleep thru it|`|01Mu3wUeaa	1: There is no such thing as the stomach flu.Its called Norwalk virus.    2: You are not going to die of hunger.You can however get extremly sick if you do not keep hydrated.    3: Don't drink soda.Soda will make the symptoms worse.Have someone pick you up some pedialyte or gatorade so you can replace your electrolytes.      4: You can eat something! it doesn't matter if it will go right through you.As long as the vomiting is not happening, you can eat.Try to stick with crackers, dry toast, apples, bananas etc.    No dairy, soda or juice.      Prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|FyIcIzIoaa	yeah your freakin,you wanna make sure your drinking lots and gatorade will help restore your system,but if thats not staying with you  ,you may want to go to the ER make sure your not dehydrated,they can start an IV of fluids,that would help you out alot|`|39DbDiagaa	After one week of no food you have a chance of dieing, but if you cant even keep down liquids then i would see a doctor.|`|QvXBjm9Qaa	If your stomach is not upset anymore, and you are not vomiting, start out with toast or crackers.

I'm afraid of dying a slow, painful death, and the idea of not existing is unpleasant and boring.  I'm more or less at peace with the fact that one day I will die, I just hope that it will be later rather than sooner, and that I'll continue to live a good/happy life in the intervening years.    I don't believe in an afterlife, which I suppose means I have less to fear and also less to look forward to or hope for.    Edit: I should note that I do harbor some hope that accelerating advances in medical technology/biotech, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence will allow me to live long enough to experience the technological Singularity -- which is sometimes called "the rapture of the nerds."  Basically, I think that one day in the semi-near future (that is, within the next few hundred years at the latest) technological advances will allow (or even force) humanity to radically transform itself physically and mentally (an aspiration often referred to as transhumanism or posthumanism).|`|2QbPDhluaa	give no mercy to your fear|`|w09AOQ4Baa	If you do not worry about where you were before you were born, why worry about where you will be after you die?
JEteneuUaa	Oral sex|`|07YBD5mJaa	Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus. No doubt you've heard of "herpes" before, but don't jump ahead of yourself. There are actually two types of herpes simplex virus, "type 1" and "type 2."    Type 1 herpes simplex virus.  Herpes simplex virus type 1 ("HSV1") generally only infects those body tissues that lie "above the waistline" and it is HSV1 that causes cold sores in the majority of cases.  Type 2 herpes simplex virus.  Herpes simplex virus type 2 ("HSV2") usually only infects those body tissues that lie "below the waistline" and it is this virus that is also known as "genital herpes." Herpes simplex virus type 2 is not usually the virus that causes cold sores, although it can.      When you think of having an infection you usually assume that you were recently exposed to the germ that has caused your problem. With cold sores this is not the case. Cold sores are not a sign of a recently acquired herpes simplex infection but instead a reactivation of herpes virus particles already living in your body. Cold sores occur when latent herpes simplex virus particles, which have been lying dormant ("asleep"), become reactivated.    http://www.consumer-values.com/blog/feb-...|`|WpaQKpckaa	I get them all the time but I'm not sexually active.

Injury to the lips from excessive exposure to bright sunlight or ultraviolet lamps.   Menstruation or pregnancy.   An immune system deficiency.   --------------------------------------...  Effective tips on how to cure cold sores    Make sure to maintain the fever blisters clean and dry. Do not attempt to cover them up through makeup because you might only worsen the cold sore attack. Besides, concealing with thick layers of makeup is rarely ever effective.    Protect the cold sore area with petroleum jelly to hasten the healing process, avoid cracking, bleeding, and minimize spreading.     Apply some lip balm that has sunscreen protection to avoid worsening the cold sores. Remember that many cold sore outbreaks are due to prolonged exposure to sunlight.    Putting cold compress or tea bags over the cold sores will aid in soothing pain and discomfort and in decreasing the swelling. Tannic acid contained in tea have natural anti-viral effects that may work on your cold sores.    Eat lots of lysine-containing foods but avoid foods that are either citrus or contain arginine.     Lysine stops the cold sore virus from replicating while arginine keeps them alive. Take in more dairy products and potatoes which are two of the richest sources of lysine. Avoid or do away with arginine sources like peas, whole grains, and chocolates. Acidic foods are seen to initiate and aggravate cold sores, so avoid citrus fruits as much as possible.    Herbs such as peppermint, aloe vera and sage are popular and very effective. Simply apply a few drops of the herbal extract and allow the anti-viral effect of the herb to do the work.    There are over the counter and prescription drugs that put to your cold sores.    Almost all cold sore medications relieve the symptoms and the itching brought about by cold sores. However, even if some anti-cold sore medications claim that they can remove your cold sores permanently, do not expect it to really do.

Chillax!|`|2lKvVtIyaa	I felt really uncomfortable for a really long time and was really embarassed, but then I just decided to be determined to be comfortable with it. So, I stripped, prayed for nothing embarassing like an erection to occur, and went from there. 's kinda weird, I  sometimes like to prove myself and show how okay with it I am by intentionally being naked and around other naked guys. IDK, either do what I did if you want to be comfortable that way, or stay in you circle of comfort (which is totally okay) and be comfortable that way.|`|AA11785060	it's pretty much normal for most guys, but if you've never experienced undressing or showering with other guys even as a kid, it can be somewhat of a shock. Best to just get over your apprehension and boldly "when in Rome, do as the Romans do".  You get used to it quickly, and in a few weeks won't think a thing about it.  If you have a tendency to get some engorgement down below when nude, spend more time at home just hanging out, literally, so your body gets used to being nude as a normal thing-- not just to shower or have sex.  Most problems with guys just experiencing the bare-assed world of locker rooms is due to not being used to feeling air down there, since it is almost always covered, If you just strip off in the bathroom to shower and in the bedroom to change, you don't get the same sensation as walking around a bunch of lockers and moving in and out of the showers, etc.   Good luck.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Nothing to it my friend.

You are taking a step to growing up and being confident also overcoming the stuff about being rude, indecent, gay, arrogant, immoral un-Christian and whatever other mythology there is about the practical and necessary need to be clean and the social benefit of sharing the experience.   Well done for getting into being an adult.    Many men never get over their hang up and arrogance about being seen naked. Who cares that matters?   Only you.|`|QBUypAmAaa	At my university's gym, we have partitioned showers with doors, so if you don't want to be seen naked you don't have to be. Of course there's a lot of guys who do go around naked and usually they're older men, I guess the younger men think 'that's too gay' or something immature like that.   I shower naked in there since I can close the door, but have never walked around naked, because although I have a body better than a lot there, it's still not up to my standards to feeling comfortable enough to not mind other guys seeing it. It should be in about a year though, and I actually can't wait until the moment I feel comfortable being naked in a locker room, I don't want to feel any bit ashamed of myself.  For your locker room just keep your head up and if you happen to steal a glance at another guy's manhood, that's ok, don't stare at it though and don't say anything if he catches you, just mind your own business and act like nothing happened I mean your eyes only have so few places to go, so as expected they'll see another guy's stuff a few times with or without your wanting them to.|`|W2z5dCrmaa	I got over feeling awkward at swimming pools. When you get out of the water, you want to shower in fresh water, and most of those showers are between the area where you come from the water to where the locker rooms are.     You really need to take your trunks off to wash away the chlorine and pool water from your mid body and package, so you take off your trunks to do that. Some Dudes look, and some don't. It doesn't matter at all.  Some compare, some are interested in seeing, and some just don't care. I'm put together really good, and even if I wasn't, it doesn't matter at all.    It's about being there for the swim, and everything else is just natural. It would be awkward if it was mixed with Ladies there, because mental stimulation and awareness of a Lady seeing my gear, would cause Me! :- ) to get a really hard on!    Me! :- )|`|4MtR8MLpaa	Not a problem for me. Had to do that since 9th grade in high school and the fitness centers since. Current use LA Fitness.

ClQOqiBvaa	That depends on a number of things. First, look at your learning style. For example, if you're a visual learner, you'll want to read something with plenty of diagrams. Second thing to consider: how much detail do you need to know? There are simple, somewhat ambiguous ways of explaining these systems but the more detail you have to go into, the harder it'll be. If you need to read something, choose something that explains the material in the way that you can understand and explains what you need to know in appropriate amounts of detail.    For the cardiovascular system, though, you can do it very systematically. Start with where the blood enters in the heart (through the superior and inferior vene cava to the left atrium) and then figure out what happens after that (for example, the left atrium, the blood goes through the tricuspid valves and into the left ventricle). Keep following the blood until you end up back at the beginning at the left atrium.    What also helps when learning about the body is knowing what certain terms mean. For example, learn the difference between superior and inferior so you can remember where they are in relation to the heart. These kinds of terms exist everywhere in anatomy and physiology so it's very helpful to know them.|`|AA12071655	There are no shortcuts to learning. You read the material, and read it again, and think about it, and read it again until you finally understand it.    Whoever gave you the idea that "study" is supposed to be easy?

pvYy6iTSaa	Dear prophit gf - Your description of burning when you pee and a yellow, creamy discharge is also the way an infection called Trichomonas appears.  It is caused by a single cell protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis.  It is easily diagnosed by examining a drop or two of the discharge either while wet or driedon a glass slide  and stained.  The whole test could be done in minutes where a microscope is available and a trained lab technician or physician looks..  If you have it, you can be almost sure your bf also has it.  This means you and he can keep passing it back and forth between yourselves for years unless you are both successfully treated and don't have other sex partners till both are clear.  Use of condoms greatly helps prevernt infection.  Treatment is simple.  Visit your local STD or free clinic for an accurate diagnosis and treatment and make SURE that your bf does the same before you continue sex with him again.  The cure could be within days.

8SRjELNBaa	This is how i understand it:    As you exercise your blood vessels expand to circulate blood, and ventilate heat.

It has worked wonders on my teeth (although they weren't bad to begin with, but nonetheless the results were noticeable). They are whiter, and Aquafresh has strengthened the enamel of my teeth. The last checkup I had at the dentist was met very positively.     Personally, my routine involves Whitening Listerine, following by brushing with Aquafresh Advanced, then regular Listerine, lastly followed up by the purple Listerine, meant to strengthen the teeth to prevent cavities. Very positive effects thus far.
800607246df3ce3c65b01624978cb3dcaa	Some basic facts: when your body is starving, it holds on to fat to feed your brain. What you burn off instead is muscle - not only the muscle you can see but also the muscle of your heart and other vital organs. When your heart muscle is damaged, you can suffer heart failure which is potentially fatal.   600 calories a day is a starvation diet. You will put your health at risk in a very short time if you follow this diet.There is no protein and very little fat is the foods you listed. As unpopular as it is these days, fat is vital in your diet. Without it, you will become malnourished quickly. This is an extremely unhealthy diet.   Also, 88 lbs is a ridiculous weight to want to be. (For us Brits, it is less than 6.5 stone).   If you don't believe me, go and speak to your doctor and see what he says. He will tell you exactly what a diet like this will do to your body and it isn't pleasant.   Be sensible with your health and follow a doctor-approved diet.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	There is no lean protein!!  Use whole grain bread only.  You will get bored with this diet very quickly.  Use more foods that are low in carbs and calories.|`|ZkuYBUByaa	Hmmm sounds like your STARVING yourself.  If you are trying to lose weight, simply eat 3 small meals per day with 2 small snacks.  Do not starve yourself because in the end you will only overeat.  Follow that and exercise 4-6 times a week.|`|k8F0n289aa	you need to get at least 1000 cals a day i have lived off less and lost loads of weight but ppl are saying you loose weight quik and then it stops working..  but other than that its a good diet drink plenty of water too =]  xx|`|xJzT2uEfaa	no that is too few calories.....what weight are you trying to get down to? (if you tell me, then i can tell you how many calories you should consume in order to get down to that weight and to stay at that weight without any problems)    EDIT: although to me that sounds light, it may not be for your height, so anyway a person at 88 pounds who isn't active at all needs to consume 1200 calories a day.....now if you start consuming that many calories but break it up between 3 meals and 2 to 3snacks, the weight will fall off until you reach that weight.....now if you add exercise such as a simple walk, the weight will come off faster and you will tone up which will make you look and feel better about yourself.....anyway, below are the links i used to get the caloric amount for a person that size (so that you can see for yourself how much you need to eat) and there is a link that will help you track your calories, and exercises.    good luck to you :-D
WEekT4b6aa	You need to talk to a counselor... family counselor... school counselor... someone who is trained to help you.      aha... I see you DO see a counselor and make sure she cannot help you.  You need to tell her about the cutting or she won't be able to help you.  Keep in mind that, if you commit suicide, you'll be punishing your mother  and brother and torturing them.  That would be self centered and cruel thing to do.      You know you're mental.  You don't need to be told.  We cannot make you do the right thing.  If you love your mother and brother and don't want them to suffer, then you'll tell them AND the counselor about your cutting.  When you say you "can't" the truth is that you mean you won't!  Help your mother and brother.  Tell them and the counselor all the deepest darkest secrets, like the cutting, and how long you've felt suicidal.  If you tell me you "can't" I won't believe you.  I'll know you just want to wallow in self pity instead of healing from the hurts caused you by your father.  If you commit suicide, you'll be saying your abusive father was right, and that's bogus.  cw|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Sweetheart, self harming is the same as cutting and it is an addiction. There are crisis numbers you can call they are staffed by professionals who can help you with your feelings One is 1-800-273-talk and another is 1-800-833-5948. When you are feeling down and suicidal talk to them they will help you. Also click onto this site written by someone who was feeling the same as you do http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/  Know always that you are loved, that this is a hard time and it will pass. Maybe you can ask you mother to just destroy your father's cards and not tell you about them. That would help take some pressure off of your mind.  Remember that those who love you would be davastated for life if you harmed yourself.  Try to spend more time with your friends, it always helps to talk to someone outside of therapy and family. Take care you are loved and this is going to change, it always does.  Be proud of your mother for getting you into therapy.  A lot of moms wouldn't do that.|`|S7Q3fRvoaa	It sounds like you are going through a rough patch in your life right now.  I am too.  I can relate to you with your family situation-- my dad is an asshole and my parents are gettting a divorce, but im still stuck living with him for now and can't stand his abuse (verbal and phyiscal).  You just have to hang in there.  Life isnt always going to be pretty, but the hard times are what makes us stronger and builds character.  Just remember that.  For now, try to do things that make you happy.  Exercise is great you can walk or jog around your neighborhood.  It really helps me de-stress and gets my mind off things.  Music is also great.  Or you can try volunteering.  Helping people less fortunate than you are (and believe me, things could be worse--im not saying your situation doesnt suck, but things can always be worse) will help get your mind off your own problems.      As for counseling, ask if you can maybe see another one.  It would be really beneficial for you to talk to someone, but you have to find someone you trust first.  Maybe there's another family member or a  school guidance counselor who you could speak with? I know that my guidance counselor at school is wonderful, it really helps to talk to someone you trust.  Other than that, just hang in there and know there are brighter days ahead.  I promise. Things WILL get better.|`|GPjSN0LPaa	im thge same way i just ra away and my parents stoped bein assfaces and i started masterbating and stoped lisning to everyone!|`|Ewosh9pTaa	Wow, that sounds tough.   But hang in there, because you can leave that whole situation and spend a few years working out who YOU are.  The world is an incredible place.   It can be incredibly beautiful, painful, hurtful, creative...  If you REALLY feel suicidal then ANYTHING is better then death, so just walk away and hit the road and find out who YOU are.  Good luck. A million people (myself included) have done the same thing and wish you luck.
NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	Those diet pills don't work....|`|hSOEgpPNaa	Diet and cardio, oh, you already know that.  Well pills don't work.  Think about it, if you could just take a pill why do so many people work out and diet all the time?
8WfFuSlQaa	Try doing something physical outdoors.  Maybe try running or lifting weights.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	There are plenty of herbal remedies for sleeplessness, just don't mix any with prescription meds. Try Valerian root, Skullcap, Passion Flower, or Melatonin, which is produced naturally in the body - you can buy tablets of it and it makes you sleepy. The other herbs mentioned can be taken as a tea, in capsules, or as a tincture - go to your local health food store and they can steer you in the right direction.|`|NYr4p2qEaa	sleepy-time tea and a book.|`|ahSJmjVqaa	Try not watching TV at least 30 min before you go to bed, Stretch before sleeping, make sure you room is clean dark quiet and cool, relax as much as you can. Think about each part of your body relaxing, it helps. Good luck!|`|mTZBeih3aa	I saw a sleep specialist for insomnia recently. Her advice was as follows:  - put your alarm clock or bedside clock under your bed so that you aren't monitoring the time  - do not have a TV in your bedroom  - your bedroom is only for sex and sleep  - have a light snack before bed  - if you still can't sleep, leave the bedroom and go to another room and read    It really does work. When I go to bed now, it only takes me a few minutes to fall asleep.|`|3A7nFOfJaa	Insomnia is a big problem for many people and it is not so difficult to avoid it by different stuff to do I have read about that and I just realize that many factors involved and the solution is as following:  I suggest you should firstly breath fresh air and listen to low music that make you a little relieved. After that remember not to have any drink like coffee or tee or stuff like that which have with nervous system to do   You are also supposed to have any fruits since they have positive significance.  Do not let any light because such thing belongs to physical Nuisance which lead to negative result so avoid that.  If you are sexually excited try not to stop that but relieve yourself by practicing sex anyway so that the nervous cells can keep resting.  more factors by which you experience in the day life may bother you so try to forget that by deep breath or any other relaxing motion  Recommended idea is that before you intend to go to bed you r supposed to be  tired as much as it required  If That never stop, get a consultation from a doctor
USoqyjaAaa	They hopefully also sent a culture.  That will provide you with the definitive result, since there are a couple of types of bacteria that could look like this.  It would help to know why they did the throat culture.

Rk46lIBwaa	Many girls experience irregular episodes of abdominal cramps before periods start. There may also be a little coloured discharge or staining.|`|BG8vMyZjaa	When I was 13 and a few days before my first period I had a slight spotting - brown discharge - which I just ignored in hopes!

That was the only sign I had and it is a very common one|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Many women do not experience any signs beforehand, some women experience an increase in discharge in the few years or months leading up to menarche. The mean age for menarche in the UK is 12 years and 11 months. There is no way to know exactly when you will start- just enjoy your time without it!
aeiP74PLaa	masterbate before u go outside ull feel relaxed|`|gkqmrIAGaa	There are things that you can do on your own. One is to sit down and make a list of all of your good qualities, there are more than you know so think hard. Keep the list and read it often and believe every word you have written.  Your mind is fooling you and you can change it. Also it helps to look in the mirror often and say "I like you" mean it when you say it. Keep this up for awhile and you will feel socially stronger.|`|1899lYjMaa	I too have been a victim of social anxiety, and anxiety in general. You ask how to overcome it yourself, but sometimes asking for help is the best answer. There are some really good prescriptions out there that can help you. See your doctor for these. Something I experimented with (since I didn't have medical insurance at the time) was smoking marijuana. Its illegal in most states, however it was affective. I am not recommending that, just offering some food for thought. It is also a good idea, to practice social situations with strangers. It takes alot of the pressure off knowing you will never see those people again, you can speak with absolute confidence. My best medicine was taking a job as a sales person. Interacting with people everyday makes it alot easier.|`|BgYceYtAaa	You've already made a huge step in the right direction by seeking help, researching it on your own and admitting that you may have a problem.  Unfortunately, some folks live in denial about their anxiety issues and try to hide from the truth and sometimes never improve their lives for the better.   So good for you, it's great you're pursuing some help with this.  It's also good that you're being proactive and willing to do certain things on your own to overcome your anxiety.    I've found it's best to solve any problem in life with a quality do-able plan and a standard effective plan for this would be as follows:    A)  Admit your situation (this you've already done, way to go)  B)  Identify the cause to help understand your condition and how to resolve it  C)  Meditate regularly to relieve stress and reprogram your subconscious mind's beliefs  D)  Begin interacting with others in small increments of time, slowly building up time length as you go  E)  Practice with family and friends  F)  Reward yourself by doing something you truly enjoy   G)  Laugh as much as possible (e.g. Watch a really funny movie, etc.)  H)  Be persistent, don't quit and eventually you'll succeed in having greater self confidence    As you advance through a program like this you'll start to notice improvements in yourself which will give you some confidence.  Then you'll be able feed off of that confidence and this will build even MORE confidence.  It's like building a snowball and so you just have to keep rolling along with it.  You probably have done this with other areas of your life, e.g. walking, talking, riding a bike, driving, hobbies, interests, etc.           There's a really great article on this website about how a man with chronic anxiety was able to overcome it naturally --  http://tinyurl.com/da7zd7

tEmnBO5Kaa	RINSING IS THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO!  If they put sutures there then the clot is pretty secure. Do not rinse!! that is how you will disturb the clots that are forming.  Do not drink from a strw, and sleep with your head propped up.  Just brush gently and try to stay away from those areas.  As for the bad breath that will go away once you have healed.|`|GgZOEii7aa	Stop worrying, you got your teeth removed by a professional.

If you had your wisdom teeth out yesterday then today will be the worst pain wise and swelling..    If you had stitches they will still be in there and doing their job, don't try and play around with your mouth to much just try and let it heal.    Blood is normal and the clot would be fine as well. Put some salt and water in a cup and rise your mouth out, it will help to heal ASAP :)|`|0lG71HNIaa	so im not the only one! I had a wisdom tooth taken out yesterday as well! i was so worried about the clot as well, but a little bit of bleeding is perfectly normal. did it feel like someone hit you in the face with a baseball bat too? wow mine hurt!     anyways, you shouldn't be worried it sounds like you are healing just fine. I am a dental assisting student and I have been doing a lot of research on the post op procedures for this so i would be prepared. if you want you can put a heat pad on your cheeks to stimulate blood circulation to help healing and rinse with salt water after you eat to clean the areas out. good luck to the both of us!!|`|7lc0wWpEaa	yeah after a few days of getting them out, its okay to rinse with salt water because this helps the mouth heal!!

I have always had such light light periods that I barely ever knew when i had them except, I used cramps to judge when auntflo was headin to my house.|`|SSNcpI6qaa	YUP!! YOU CAN FEEL IT LEAKING OUT!! HAHA|`|BXR26DqWaa	She most likely did not realize that she had started. Sometime it is hard to tell at first. I am sure that she would not have let you do anything like that if she knew.|`|8OUegINnaa	Hmm yeah. . . I know when I am|`|n1d0XpnIaa	Well sometimes you can tell & other times you cant i would prob believe your gf as she said sorry & may not of know that it was coming|`|Jio3d8bYaa	Oh I feel so bad for her!!!!! You should make her feel better and tell her it's not a big deal because she's probably so embarassed!!|`|fY68d3mAaa	no, girls don't always know. and she was probably really really embarrassed. also, if you've ever heard the phrase, you might have "popped her cherry."|`|Bge5zjJYaa	maybe it was a pouch of fake blood like in the movies that seems like a lot|`|hfZIKrhCaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  THANX!!!!|`|KRbyZLfhaa	well she knows if shes had it for a few days, but if she just got it that day, she might not have realized it. she wasnt lying. sometimes you just dont notice it right away.|`|RoicHy87aa	if she knew, she probably wouldn't have let you down there without fair warning. it's not like there is a noticeable difference in the texture between blood and being wet. that has happened to me before and yeah. all you can really do is apologize over and over and over again.|`|16bWGB14aa	She probably started while you were fingering her and didn't realize it.|`|ZejOcCgDaa	Well she must of had some idea that she was due for it.  But woman cannot tell the exact day that they will get there period it just comes....  I am pretty sure she would tell you if she had her period, I am sure she is completely embarrassed by the whole thing.|`|iI36w7wVaa	Girls usually know when it is coming because each month it usually lands on the same day. they have a pretty steady schedule.  Sometimes though, they can be surprised about it starting. She may have not been sure if it was supposed to start tonight or tomorrow, morning or night, so she may not have been lying.  I don't think she was lying because if she knew that was going to happen, she would not have been so apologetic and embarrassed.  I doubt she would want to jeopardize your relationship.  Don't think too much of it.  Yeah, that's a little rank, but you'll be alright. I'm surprised she didn't feel it happening, though she was probably very preoccupied and enjoying the moment.  You fingering her also could have excited her and started her a few hours earlier than planned.  I'm just guessing.     Don't worry about it.|`|aeiP74PLaa	her p**ssywhole is right by her as*whole are u sure u werent fingering her butt cuz its more likely to bleed if uve ever tried anal or fisting ud know u sound kina inexperienced....plus girls know when there . is coming so also check to see if ur nails are cut...|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	Probably not i got mine today and was not aware and i had a friend over and it was just horribly embarrasing because it soaked through my shorts and i didn't know if she saw it or not and i didn't feel it and i was so embarrased so please do give her the benefit of the doubt!|`|aIYNCnedaa	I dont think she was bleeding that much bro|`|655c130558c6c26f52d0d69067a76b42aa	Some of us know and some of us don't it dependz wether you are a regular or irregular. I'm pretty sure she didn't know, and she is probably extremely embarrassed so don't bring it up @ all it will only make her feel bad.|`|pIowrU4Saa	yes|`|w7ypfscBaa	It's definitely possible she didn't notice it, especially if she thought any wetness down there was due to you rather than her period.|`|JSD0RYhzaa	sometimes you cant tell if its discharge or a period.    her period might be irregular    sometimes i get mine unexpectedly and i just put it off because i think its discharge but then i find out that its not tell    tell her you accept her apology|`|ArDjAl4Raa	Well if the girl is in school or really bored, it's easy to feel because you can't stop it from coming like you can with pee. But if you're fingering her and she's already wet, it's hard to tell what kind of wetness it is.|`|rP6EcECWaa	It depends.  If she didn't know that her period was gonna start that day,  and you were fingering her, you would definitely know first.  Not everybody has symptoms that their period is coming, so its possible she didn't know.  Im sure she wouldnt have let you do that if she was though.|`|91Lskorraa	Honestly, sometimes girls don't. If a girl doesn't have a hard time with pms and cramps they might not realized it came, especially if it wasn't expected (early/late).|`|VK5Z7fo3aa	Her period proubly just arrived like 5 minutes before that. Either that or if you guys had sex (and it was her first time). Girls bleed when having sex for the first time.|`|FTAWjtcbaa	some girls get cramps before their period  some get it after their period some don't get it at all.  I'm 100% sure she didn't do it on purpose, no girl  would want to do something to a guy like that it's embarrassing for us.|`|hFqZNO9Uaa	well im only 14 and i and most women know their bodys atleast to know when their period is coming.i know about 3 days before but i dont always know when i start bleeding.if she is smart she would watch out for the sighns and check for bleeding before you two mess around.  :)|`|Zoxuuj0Vaa	she prob didnt feel it cause she was having an orgasm! yep well its not her fault so get over it
XEtESkISaa	When I had to shop with my dad I used to say I need a personal item, and I would go down the aisle alone and get what I needed then put them in the cart. He's your dad, he knows about that stuff, and he probably doesn't care. Its something you need, he doesn't mind.    He had a child, he knows about the female body and how it works, he knows what happens every month. Don't run out for fear of embarrassment. Just get 'em.|`|16bWGB14aa	He wont mind if you go in there. Maybe just ask your dad if you could walk around on your own and then go to that isle and get them.

How old are you? Are you able to go to the store later by yourself and buy it? Or can you go with your mom? If you don't have a great relationship with your dad (like me), it is kind of uncomfortable  to mention stuff like that.

If not, then you'll just have to go ahead and get them. Tell him you need them, or just go there and pick them up in a nonchalant way. Your dad may be a man, but he surely understands the concept of menstruation and I'm sure he won't make fun of you for it!|`|cfvAJJqdaa	Don't ask just stop dead in the isle and pick something up, he will either ignore you (so as not to embarrass you) or he will stop and wait, looking around like he's lost while you look and pick something, then just put it in the cart and don't say anything and you will both just walk on as normal.    OR just say to him at some point, I need to get some girly things and go get it yourself then chuck it in the basket or whatever. If there is no basket or if you would prefer to get it yourself just say to him, can I get $5 to pick up some girly products and get it at some point yourself.|`|tCq1xpqraa	just say... "hey... i need my lady products, give me a minute plzz?"  Haha i was always afraid to tell my dad too, but last week we were getting stuff at target and i got pads.

My son is 18 and I'd be upset if HE looked at porn online! At 13, you probably will get in trouble if they find out. So you need to either stop doing it or cover your tracks. That crap is easy to get addicted to so I advise you to stop altogether.|`|nKosOzuVaa	Depends on your parents. Porn can be like a drug too. You shouldn't be using it regularly.|`|0mXQODsIaa	depends on your parents realy|`|G5oc6APhaa	A lot. You will become an extreme introvert and unable to relate to other people physically. However, we all looked at some because we wanted to be 'adult' but is really only a sign of being alone.

c71Q51Z2aa	Have you been diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris?  There are a variety of conditions that can cause itchy scalp and bald spots.    There are a number of treatments available for psoriasis, but unfortunately none of them offer a complete cure.  Psoriasis is a chronic condition that often runs in families.    Topical medications used to treat psoriasis (which are applied to the surface of the skin) include corticosteroids, tars and anthralin.  Ultraviolet light combined with a medication called psoralen (PUVA therapy) is also effective in many patients.  Other medications taken by mouth sometimes used to treat more severe cases include anti-cancer drugs like methotrexate.  These are reserved for severe cases because they can have serious side effects.    It is also important to know and avoid possible triggers of psoriasis.  These include skin injury/irritation, excessive sunlight (causing sunburns), stress/anxiety, some throat and upper respiratory tract infections.|`|xVmbTsAbaa	Psoriasis is a fungus, so try a yeast and sugar free diet, including no alcohol, bread, pizza or fruit. See how that goes.  Try all the other medical stuff as well.  Try some omega 3 oils.|`|34VXCyvVaa	A gluten-free diet apparently works for some people, but it didn't make any difference for my husband who has severe psoriasis.  He eliminated gluten, alcohol and most sugars/fruits without any results.  What works best for him is a combination of Enbrel, topical ointments and sunshine during the warm weather months.  His psoriasis is partly genetic (his father has it) and, I suspect, partly triggered by stress.  His father's psoriasis eased up after he retired and my husband's probably will, too, but we're not anywhere near that point yet.|`|VCUc4k70aa	Hello there. I recommend that you should try the herbal anti-psoriasis remedy by Champori. Get their cream : it worked better than anything else for my plaque psor.: my patches cleared in about 2 weeks and I haven't had a flare up for more than a year now.  Champori is available online from Champori.com  and comes with money back guarantee; so if it doesnt work  its free.    Best,  Bernadette|`|69SHxWA9aa	Here is how they are treating and curing Eczema and Psoriasis in Japan.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLW-HKgQ...    You can get the water in the United States too - place a add in your local http://craigslist.com and place a wanted add for 8.5 PH alkaline drinking water.  They can also make the 2.5 PH acidic water used in this video at the Hospital in Japan.    Drinking the alkaline water is one key, the other is the 2.5 PH water applied to the skin disease, and it will go away in around 5 months.    Good Luck !    PS:     If you want to avoid all sources of yeast, then in addition to bread and products containing years, there is beer, peanuts, cheese, yugart, and several things that are on the top of my head.    My doctor says to avoid shellfish (shrmp, lobster and others) than cut back on milk, and then some other checks for allergies.|`|BVqCcqOGaa	Try herbal remedies from serenaskin.com, it's natural, no steroids. I used ointment and spray on my scalp and now just take anti-psoriasis extract to prevent flare-ups. It works very well for me. My scalp is clear for more than 9 mo now.
eY0MhGfmaa	Where your body carries fat is largely determined by genetics. On the bright side, women who carry weight on theirs hips & thighs have a lower incidence of heart disease than women who carry fat on their bellies/torso.    The only way to lose weight on your hips is good 'ol diet and exercise. If being fit and trim was easy, there wouldn't be any chubby folks. You just have to make exercise a part of your daily routine. I bought a treadmill and do 30 - 60 minutes most mornings while I watch the morning news. I've been doing it for 5 months now and have lost 32 lbs. I look better and feel great. If I can do it, anyone can.    Good luck!|`|tluT02tvaa	You can go on a small diet.Subtract about 500 calories a day from your daily needs.this will drop about 1 pound a week SAFELY.You can also excersize.Bare in mind that women have naturally wider hips in order to give nutrition to their un-born babies..whenever the time arises.Hips are a sign of fertility.And since you hold more weight in your hips and not in your tummy you are less likely to develop heart and health problems because you are PEAR shaped,and not an Apple.Good for you!|`|k8F0n289aa	start biking and exercise bike ;)  its actually working for me!  xx|`|ewd70M7Naa	BECAUSE OUR BODIES STORE FAT IN DIFFERENT PLACES, YOUR THIGHS ARE NOT FAT, BUT IF YOU WORK THEM OUT THEY WILL GO AWAY, OR MAYBE THEIR JUST BABY FAT|`|niVQkQ35aa	You probably have the classic "pear" shaped body,  smaller on top and larger on the bottom.  Think of how a pear is shaped.  You can thank genes for that one and no matter how hard you try, that shape won't change.  I personally am an "apple."  I'm not really sure which is worse.  Each has its own issues.  If you're carrying excess fat in your thigh area, you can reduce calories to help eliminate the extra fat.  However, it's very hard, if not impossible, to "spot" reduce.  If you exercise your lower body you will build muscle, but you may not get rid of the extra fat.  Sometimes it's best to embrace the shape you were born with and dress your body to enhance your best features, such as a small waist.
vfhKkiSKaa	This is something you really need to discuss with a specialist.  They really try to make it sound like this is the perfect solution to weight loss, but there are many problems associated with it and it will drastically change your lifestyle.  Also, what they do not tell you in advertising, is that if you do not change your eating habits, you can gain all the weight back you will originally lose with the surgery.    Nobody here can answer this question for you.  Go talk to a physician about it, but think carefully before you do.  You say diets don't work, but have you really bucked down hard and really really tried?  Probably not.  Have you tried and exercise program along with them, probably not.  And if you have you have not stuck to either of them for the long haul.  This is what you have to do to loose weight.  It is an everyday struggle that you will have for the rest of your life.    I know how hard it is, I also am overweight and have been for most of my adult life.  I have lost weight, only to gain it back, to loose it, then to gain back.. and you know why?  Because I am not dedicated enough to really truly loose the weight, start the daily exercise (even if it is only getting off my lazy butt and walking every day) and keep with it forever.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you can find some useful information in a web search for "natural remedies for obesity".    Gastric bypass surgery should only be a very last resort and at your young age perhaps you have not exhausted all other avenues.    Have you tried a web search for "gastric bypass surgery" for information and research?|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Bad idea. You need your stomach to digest food and get vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals out of your food. It's not natural to just not have a stomach.    Eat fruits and veggies every day.. lots of them... like 4 oranges, a half a head of red cabbage, and half a bag of carrots (Vary this each day). Eat moderate amounts of meat. Eat absolutely no transfats or refined carbs (pasta, bread, etc. unless 100% whole grain). I started going this and I just stopped getting hungry, I don't starve myself I just don't get hungry very often, I eat a small amount of food and I'm full.|`|GoluIRIAaa	People think that this is a good option but your constricted to very strict diets in order to stay healthy and it's a completely different way of eating. I would suggest you spend the money on a proffesional that can taylor specific workouts and nutrition special to you and you will probably have more success.|`|AA11739944	I would try anything and everything before surgery, especially that one. I know people who have had this done and they look terrible. Yeah, they loose the weight fast, but they look like they are going to die.  Keep dieting and exercising. Invest in a nutritionist and a trainer. It CAN be done without surgery.|`|AA10409832	Gastric bypass should be a last result.  You need to do two things: 1. reduce your caloric intake to about 2000 calories a day, and 2. start to do aerobic exercises like walking.  Get your heart rate up a little at a time and get your breathing up a little at a time when you walk.  You'll feel hungry, but when your body gets used to it, you won't feel as hungry anymore.  Stick to this.  I had a friend that weighed over 350lbs.  He stopped eating junk and in-between meal snacks, and lowered his calorie in-take, and walked everyday and lost 100 lbs.  He started walking 20 mins. per day.  He was exhausted.  Little by little he upped the length of his walks.  Now, he walks for 90 mins. a day and does a lot of hills.  He walks 6 miles in those 90 mins.  That's a 16 min. mile.  When I walk with him, I have trouble keeping up and I'm in pretty good shape.  Good luck.  I hope you make it.|`|Gx1ewGOFaa	It depends. A gastric bypass is a serious operation, and you would never, ever be able to eat normally ever again. If you seriously think it's your only hope though, you should discuss it with your GP.|`|ASlObUaIaa	are you saying that you weigh 200 lbs?  Or that you are 200 lbs over what your healthy weight would be?  If your 200lbs, then no.  Diet and exercise and you'll be fine.  If you are 200 over a healthy weight, then maybe.  But it still requires diet and exercise.  When I was 18 I didn't have a whole lot of self control.  If you think that you can get the surgery, and make yourself follow a strict diet and exercise regimen, then maybe it would be ok.  I'd talk to your doctor, and get more than one opinion.

It usually works.|`|cJg3GruDaa	You can try saying something like, "Hey, Mom, do you think I could use some whitening strips?" If she says no, don't beg her, though. She will probably have a good reason if she won't let you.|`|9GvflDg1aa	"Mom, I want to use whitening strips"
VNvVhDWgaa	I would go to the hospital or your doctor immediately. The lower back is where the kidneys are and you're probably not reading too much into this. When there is pain in the area of the kidneys, there is often an infection or other issue taking place.    I have had 2 kidney infections and both of them were discovered because of lower back pain and tenderness. Especially if your urine is darker than normal, has blood in it, or you have difficulty going, then you need to go to the ER asap.    The pain for kidneys is just above the waist at your lower back a couple inches to each side of your spine. If that's where it is, then get medical treatment as quickly as possible, especially since your medication can cause problems with your kidneys, and diabetics have a slower healing time than average people.|`|d4b208bef4b6c65668c5b927013773c1aa	Im in the same situation. Diabetes and lupus and having kidney pain, but kidney pain is not in lower back. Its mid back, under your bottom rib, and goes right through you to the front down to the bladder.(Called flank area)  It might be the START of kidney problems though if your meds say it could cause kidney problems, because diabetes can cause it too. You would not be having any kidney pain unless you had a kidney infection or kidney stone or nephritis, and often nephritis has no symptoms. That's what you fear with diabetes, is the silent kidney damage of nephritis. It's been 2 months for me, theyre still trying to find out the kidney problem. I hope yours is not kidney. Use heating pad or hot gel pack in microwave to see if its a muscle strain.|`|SnTuaKcJaa	Only thing you can do is see your doctor! No one on here can tell you what is wrong.

W3UYWpxiaa	Never take more than the recommended dose.  If you take the maximum amount everyday you can damage your liver.  If you pain that requires you to take that much Tylenol you need to see you doctor.  I understand taking it once in and while for aches and pains, but you shouldn't have to take it daily unless there is some sort of problem.  Again, go to your doctor and get checked out.|`|nEVoabeSaa	Why are you taking it? It would be better to get the underlying reason sorted and stop taking it. Best of Luck|`|gtx2cjWZaa	taking 2 000 mg of Tylenol at a time will make any pain you have worse. and it can cause damage to your liver and kidneys.
iDypBPv6aa	I use a menstrual cup(Mooncup UK), and it never leaks on me at night. If your tampons leak because they're overfull, you definitely won't have that problem with a menstrual cup. But if the cup isn't positioned/popped open right, it will definitely leak. I don't move around much in my sleep, but I've walked and stretched a fair bit while wearing my menstrual cup and it never leaked unless it was too full.     As for what cup to try, you'll have to choose according to your body. The DivaCup is really long, while MooncupUK, Lunette, Femmecup etc are shorter. The Miacup is supposed to be the smallest, and therefore best for young virgin first-time users.   I suggest you do some thorough research before choosing a menstrual cup. The results, I find, are totally worth it!|`|kUCVLuTPaa	that's disgusting. you shouldnt use that...or tampons always..do u realize you are making your vagina a bacteria enviroment and you can catch a uti by this. you should consider using tampons only sometimes and pads...Thats what i think at least..but as far as menstrual cups..you shouldn't use them...they make it easier for you to have leaks...stick to pads and tampons|`|aeiP74PLaa	Ehh I'm not sure about the cup leaking at night, it shouldn't if it is in place right.

lZ9Dl5Nhaa	What a lame *** question.|`|AA11989999	It is said that some muscle guy took shots in the gut, until he could withstand a cannonball shot at his gut. Impressive, but that kind of muscle might look tough, but not be able to lift much. It's a different kind of strength--isometric instead of isotonic.|`|76845aa2d3f727081f73b3db267a28b8aa	you will get a bruise on the arm and have a sore gut if you punch it.|`|sZnHP6Rnaa	uhm no. but you might get some bruises.|`|b3655bbd8d53a4392d8189a659dbf68eaa	lol no just bruises  try like lifting a three lb thingy   i did it and got pretty toned|`|LGidAYDwaa	You'll be more likely to get bruises. :-)  Muscles are built with exercise - tensing muscles can help a tiny bit, but it wouldn't be enough to make you more than just a little more toned.|`|EVY4zGFwaa	no, you wont. what twisted logic.
f6qmRicQaa	Clean the area thoroughly and dry it.  Use Caldesene powder, it comes in a pink bottle.  If you still itch, and can't control yourself put socks over your hands so you don't tear your skin.|`|W9fQuQlWaa	self control and healing lotion! also try a neosporin type cream.|`|441GSyaMaa	Have a bath? that may help? or do something to occupy your hands or keep your mind of the itchyness|`|ZoHLFcNCaa	If your skin is red and itchy you might have exzyma its not that serious but you should check the doctors for some cream|`|VwD7fKw8aa	Soaking in Epson Salts with help since salt has a healing quality. It is used for sore muscles, skin conditions, bruises, etc. You could also try Caladril lotion (the pink stuff). Try not to scratch it though since that will delay healing. Good luck!|`|ozpB4ADVaa	You need to use something like Aquaphor or Eucerin CREAM not lotion for very dry skin. And you need to apply it multiple times a day so your skin can become healthy again retaining its own moisture. Also, you may want to try an oral antihistamine like claritin, benedyrl., or zyrtec to help with the itching. You need to control the picking and scratching yourself. What I have suggested are tools to help you.|`|ltlNGzmkaa	i have that problem too.  lotion your itching spots after taking a shower.  if not,  go see a docter|`|m6hUZPlKaa	This is going to be kind of embarassing if you do it in public, but a good way to stop from scratching is from slapping where it itches, it works very well, just don't slap too hard! :] Good luck
HvQvRVnJaa	Yep. I was 4 years old ONLY FOUR in the late 80s early 90s when the school board demanded doctors drug me up on heavy doses of ritalin. It absolutely RUINED my childhood. Its a scam to make money and only the WORST cases should ever be medicated...It wasnt until I was 15 that i forced them to STOP GIVING THAT to me... Any sort of stimulant can steer a child toward devastation that can affect him or her for the rest of their lives. The ritalin made it so i was unable to develop socially, and delayed my growth physically. it also did harm to the parts of my brain related to Testosterone and sex. Its a lose lose situation in my case. I am 24 now and just barely recovering and catching up with my social skills and I actually grew a vertical inch in the past year, possibly due to delayed adolescent growth.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Childhood sucked when I was anyplace with uptight rules... school was horrible.

AA10358331	Well you don't necessary need to wear a pad, but a liner works well. Keep pads with you in your backpack just incase it starts. But there's nothing wrong with wearing one. You don't need to worry about TSS.|`|c8a188861f0a854648ff16ed2a2476a9aa	I remember back in the stone ages I did this for a while. But when you start, it will probably only be a drop or two, it's not going to come gushing out. Don't worry about the boys laughing--they're just laughing because they don't understand.|`|hKZ5dRbSaa	It's good that you're prepared for you're period, But just because you're friend have started they're periods dont mean that you  will. You can start at any age, I know someone that didn't start till 16. You may not start your period until agess, if you do at school, just use tissue if there isn't any machine, at my school they do them at the office. And being on your period is nothing that you should share. You don't need to tell anyone.|`|XxG9SqYoaa	Well the first time you get your period it should be really light, light enough to the point that you don't need to say anything about it until you get home so I don't think you need to wear one.|`|dt5oSNQ5aa	Yeah it's sort of normal but if anything as soon as you feel something weird run to the bathroom and check and if it is your period, and if it is you can always go to the nurse|`|1nC4fVw3aa	lol don't worry i don't think you should be wearing a pad because you can kinda tell when your about to start like you will get  a lot of pimples,your stomach will hurt. one sign that i have is that my boobs hurt and when your on your period on the 1st day..its not that heavy.|`|JW2gxnNQaa	yess its better to be prepared.|`|9Z6K8RBRaa	You don't have to wear a pad all the time.    There's a special kind called a pantyliner that is much much thinner and will keep your periods from catching you off-guard. Then, when you notice your period, you can just switch to a regular pad.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	yeah its good to be prepared..but u will know when you're about to get your period for example you'll start getting white discharge then you'll know its time to wear a pad|`|76SAdZ19aa	You should wear a pantyliner when you get  some period symptoms like disharge, dizziness, acne, cramps, cravings, etc.|`|DPpQ5EwJaa	It's ok to be prepared, but you're going a little overboard.  It would be better to keep one in your backpack just in case, rather than on your body.  And remember, it be another two years before you get it.|`|5ee357e01c343e80aa51403c069dace3aa	If you're really worried about it then wear a pad, there is nothing wrong with that and when you do get your period you'll be prepared! Ask your mom or dad if they could buy you some pantyliners- they are thinner than pads and will be more comfortable to wear. But usually your first period will be fairly light, so I wouldn't worry too much about it! Don't worry about those boys, they are just immature and don't quite understand the whole period thing at that age. Good luck sweetie.|`|Jegvchhnaa	You are really paranoid....but you will most likely be able to tell before it gets to the point where you would be embarassed....Just dont wear WHITE PANTS!!!  :P
f0NFwXxwaa	Hello,           I think at some point in our life we all go through this feeling and if I may say so I think it tends to affect people who tend to have an above average intelligence.    They seem to have a deeper level of consciousness and a more creative mind set that makes us look at ourselves in relation to what the majority say what is right and wrong, good and evil.    I agree that the word evil is just a word and that the devil is a misconception brought about by generations of mystical chine es whispers that describes a being that has yet to be proved.    You are quite normal and no doubt an intelligent person who may be taking herself and her thoughts far too seriously.  Move on and do not dwell on these thoughts and if they do return think positive thoughts.    I have them now and then and I'm in my 40's and I tell myself or should I say my mind to think positive and to pray.    Again don't dwell on them think nice thoughts.  Take care|`|Ewosh9pTaa	I know exactly what you're saying.  But evil doesn't exist.   Evil is a human concept to try and explain the bad things that happen in life.  For example: "blindness" isn't evil: it's just a good eye that doesn't work.  A gun isn't evil: but someone who shoots someone makes that choice.  Am I making sense?  There is no good or evil.  There are just people who either have a moral code or don't.  LOVE is the meaning of life.  Try to love or try to hurt,  There is no good or evil, god or devil.  Mx|`|RvaIQ1X6aa	I am not religious, nor never will be - It's just one more thing to throw in my mess of a life, and I know it wouldn't clean it up. So, trying to be a smart ***, but I can not relate to this analogy, but if by "evil" you mean depressed, then yes.
dVK7E5Kiaa	Hi, I think the best way is to combine exercise and supplements. There are a variety of muscle building supplements but it all depends on what your goals are and how you want to get there.    A great site I found that lists the top muscle building supplements is http://www.mymuscleexercises.com/ and if you are looking for a guide on how to get ripped fast then check out , http://www.squidoo.com/howtogetrippedfas... they list the bets muscle building eBook (I use No Nonsense Muscle Building) it has helped me a lot.    Hope this information helps and message be if you need any help!|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	creatine was made to give muscles an energy boost by forcing more water into your cells. you must take creatine with carbs, because glucose its the only way to transport creatine into muscle cells.    Protein is merely a nutritional supplement. It is used in the place of missing protein in your diet. Its still popular because bodybuilder require 0.8 to 2 grams of protein per lb of body weight. At about 40 grams of protein per serving of chicken breast this leaves you at 5 chicken breast a day, which contains too much cholesterol. Make sure you get protein before you lift or directly after. Those few hours afterward is when your muscles are repairing their fibers through the use of amino acids extracted from metabolized protein.     MuscleTech Halo, NitroTech, GNC Creatine, NO2 products (to help widen your blood vessels to below better absorption of nutrients).
MnCYICRIaa	people have different attitudes towards sex, there is nothing wrong with your friend, masturbation is perfectly normal. She is at an age where she discovers sex and she has to do it her way.    Masturbation is perfectly safe. Just she should be careful not to take it further at this point. I think she is way to young to have a sexual relationship.     If she feels her sexual needs are too intense and they cause her problem in her everyday life and she has other teenage problems -such as aggression, moodiness and excessive acme- she might have a high progesterone level and might need to check her hormones with her GP, it is not that uncommon.    I would think that it might be good for her to try and channel some of her sexual energy in other ways e.g sports but she shouldn't worry about continuing to masturbate even little children do it (without fully realizing what they do). It is human nature.|`|NCNYmOPCaa	Ok ?|`|BE5HlQseaa	other girls do that (but not me) shes not a sex addict since she has not had sex yet. but maybe she was just wanting to see it im really not sure.sorry if this does not help you|`|wUwiF3Aaaa	Any age is pretty normal. If she is paying for porn, she should probably stop, especially if she is using her parents money. Also, she should consider if the porn is giving her a negative body image. If she is comfortable with herself and doesn't compare herself to the women she sees in pornography, there shouldn't be any problem with continuing.   The definition of addiction is if it interferes with living a productive life. If your friend masterbates every night before bed, she's fine. If she misses class or important events because she is masterbating, then she has a problem.|`|e5ec786ff8b2ba4d23a8bc87faee6379aa	Yes she is a sex addict. But its not her fault i am victum of it as well. Mine started when i was being molested by my girlfriends at age 7. I am now 27 and when my daughter was 3 she was already showing signs of it and still kinda does it but not as noticable. Its something in the brain we like the feeling we can't get enough of it. Just becareful when she does start having sex with boys she can go to far. like pregnancy. tell her to stick with the porn or theres big trouble. it is normal don't worry about it. She may want to have a talk with her mom to get her on birth control if shes friends with her mom and maybe you can sit with her for confort. I know i would want my daughter to come to me when that happens so i can explain it to her. your a good friend for asking. and regardless of what other girls say YES ALL GIRLS DO OR DID IT.|`|UspK4SQBaa	It's normal to masturbate at any age.  Even babies and toddlers do it.  She should leave the porn alone though.    No, I don't think she's a sex addict.|`|By1DJAUOaa	um, idk...|`|513DGClraa	I've masterbated since i was around 10|`|T5nZjBWfaa	i wouldn't consider her a sex addict. she just seems more comfortable with herself sexually then most women. nothing to worry about.|`|54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	Where is she getting hold of porn at 13? That's wrong!    Mastrubation is a natural thing for people to do and i guess different people start at different ages.
d4b208bef4b6c65668c5b927013773c1aa	Yes its possible if you have had extended long sex and if you are very small. Also if its your first time it will hurt, and if you don't have enough lubrication it will hurt. If you are a youth who can't tell your parents, there are free confidential "family planning" clinics that will help you with those things. If you are adult, try more lube, if that doesn't work, see your GYN.|`|8c77fae2d1efc15b50d461196da28260aa	depends how big your vagina is if its small than yea if it is all big and **** then maybe not!

No not at all.|`|nV8QrHZwaa	Not at all|`|u8CFwtyMaa	No, there's no problems with it, but the odd day off wouldn't hurt.Just Do it when you feel like it, as long as it's in private.|`|PsqwNTW5aa	Yes, masturbation is very addicting and something to do in moderation.|`|Eh86y9p3aa	If you're Catholic, probably.    Otherwise, no, and most teenage boys do.|`|EJSdI25Naa	No way. But, remember, it is something you can more enjoyably do in private. You will thrill to  it more with a bottle of lubrication from the supermarket or pharmacy. Be mature, though, and clean up after yourself with tissues and dispose of them thoughtfully.|`|1NWjta2jaa	By law you are allowed to do it every day, but not on Feb. 29.

That could result in poop-less wipes, which also means that you're not getting enough fluids and/or veggies in your diet.  An increase in this could soften up your poop, making for a more healthy, albeit not as clean poop.  It could also just be fortune if it's not as I described above.  Sometimes, though rarely, I'll have a healthy poop which requires maybe 1 wipe, and it's just a bit of fluid.  That's simply the result of a relaxed sphincter.  If the sphincter contracts before the turd is fully out, it will be cut and cause that small bit to wind up on your butt...but that's not your problem, apparently.|`|0RN1X1eVaa	you got a clean butt|`|R3Y4gsAdaa	You are not drinking enough water.

To optimize metabolism, energy, and mental and emotional positivity, set a goal to eat five or six small meals per day  do NOT skip meals. Sometimes you will feel like you dont have the time or the energy to put anything together, but this is critical to your success. Your body and your metabolism are designed to look for cues telling them when to burn and when to conserve. If you miss a meal your body does what it is programmed to do  stop burning. Ideally, the five meals include breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack and dinner. On occasion, you may also enjoy a healthy and delicious fat-burning dessert after dinner. This five meal ideal will keep your metabolism burning brightly, and your brain will enjoy a steady source of fuel, keeping you mentally sharp and safe from those challenging blood sugar drops that spur cravings for sub-par food choices.  So how much should you eat at each meal? Begin by keeping in mind that there is no one definition of a serving size. With both the Food Pyramid and Nutrition Facts labels, the serving size is simply a unit of measure and may not represent the amount you are really eating. For example, an English muffin represents two Food Pyramid servings of bread, despite the fact that the Nutrition Facts label on the package defines a serving as one muffin.  I learned the majority of this information at the website listed below.|`|9f60a211217feb239281a28e388fbdf0aa	Stop drinking anything else other than plain water. I can assure 100% result.

553ac7b7fe128bda796c55a6cfb5544daa	As a former bulimic, I refuse to give you advice that is likely to kill you.  I am curious as to why you think that the choice you're making is a good choice.  You must feel that you are truly fat and out of control of what you are eating to go to this extreme.  Based on what you've said, it seems obvious that those who know about this and have not done anything really must not care about you.  Also, if you feel ashamed, you must not be making the right choice in continuing to be a bulimic (because if you were making the right choice you would not feel any shame about your decisions).          I pray for you that someone cares enough about you to help you.  You seem to be a smart person who is too wrapped up in body image to understand the long-term damage that this disorder is capable of.  Most young people don't realize that after time their hair and teeth will fall out or become severely damaged from both the vomiting and the lack of nutrients.  Their skin becomes very dry and loose (making a person look older and almost alien-like).  You may begin to look bloated in certain parts of your body.       If you would be interested in talking about how you're feeling and why you feel ashamed of yourself I would be interested in listening.  I might also be able to assist you find some confidential help if you wanted to help yourself get better so you don't feel the shame.      I wish you the best of luck in combatting this disorder in a timely matter.  When you start to look like a toothless, balding, bloated alien, everyone will surely know that you are a bulimic (and sadly, at that point, there is no hope of restoring your looks), hopefully they won't be saying that standing at your coffin.|`|VOVjebIoaa	Do it in the bathroom.

AA11315360	Without a prescription the only fluoride you can buy is in toothpaste and ACT brand (or store brand) mouthwash. If you use ACT nightly yes it will help protect your teeth. It is a low strength of fluoride and needs to be used every night to work.    If you want something else speak to your dentist. They can prescribe you a strong fluoride toothpaste that you use occasionally. You brush it on your teeth at night.    Or you can get a prescription strength fluoride rinse that you use about once a week, but only available by talking to a dentist.
g4B7hlPtaa	you lose weight andd it will go .
ohj5sRpsaa	I'm sorry but what that one girl said is all a part of denial.     Before you take such drastic steps, you should have contacted your doctor. It is very unhealthy to eat so little, and the most important thing for your body is to get the nutrients it needs.    That's why eating candy, pizza and junk food will never satisfy your body because what it's looking for is healthy foods such as broccoli, oranges and lean protein like fish.     It's not a part of hitting puberty, but you have shocked your body.     The most important meal of the day is breakfast. If you eat two eggs, some wholegrain toast with no added sugar or preservative peanut butter (whatever you like on it...even butter!) and orange juice, you will feel healthier, happier and more awake. You also won't be munching on things all day which makes you obese. You can also eat a few breakfast sausages (but not often because they are processed foods).     Secondly, you should eat five small meals throughout the day. That means, breakfast was already one of them  (a big healthy breakfast)...  So what you should do is fill two of those slots with healthy snacks such as roasted nuts, apples, cheese, and yogurt. You mentioned that you like pears also - you can eat any kind of fruit really! It's good sugar! Remember to drink lots of water!    And for lunch, just a small meal. Sandwiches are good for you, as long as you fill them with the right nutrients. I.e., subway is bad, but a home made sandwich with some meat, a little mayo and mustard lettuce, sprouts, tomato, onion, and pickles is good. It will last you until dinner, which should be the smallest meal of your day.    Drink lots of water before hand, and have your second snack an hour or half an hour before dinner. This will make you full and therefore you will eat less.     Don't eat only when you are REALLY hungry. Since you are fat, your body will start to do weird things and the fat will try to compensate for the nutrients you aren't receiving.    It's not how little you eat, it's what you eat.|`|S7Q3fRvoaa	That is because you are not eating.  The same thing happened when i starved myself when i had anorexia.  Your sense of hunger gets all messed up. It's like your body cant feel hunger.  That's not good!  Please do not starve yourself.   By starving yourself, you are actually slowing down your metabolism, and your body will go into starvation mode, storing everything you eat as fat.  The best way to lose weight is to make healthy choices, eat sensible portions, and exercise.  You should aim to eat something small every 2-3 hours.  Like for breakfast, have oatmeal with berries on top and a glass of milk.  Lunch can be something like a turkey wrap and carrot sticks with lowfat milk.  And for dinner, grilled chicken breast with a veggie and whole grain rice.  And in between meals, snack on healthy things like fresh fruit, veggies dipped in hummus, almonds, pretzels, and yogurt.  And be sure you are drinking plenty of water throughout the day.      Good luck|`|BRT2teSqaa	You probably just "startled" your metabolism.  If you really are obese, and you have stopped overeating, it's probably just "confused"  However, a sudden decrease in appetite can sometimes be indicitive of a disorder, including a thyroid disorder, hormonal imbalance, or even cancer.  It's probably minor, but I urge you to make an appointment with your doctor.|`|hBcMiZDBaa	if youre obese and now suddenly dont feel like eating anymore, then thats a really good thing. I dont know whats wrong....but its gonna make losing weight easy for you.    ....im just praying that you dont over indulge a meal in the future cause you havent been eating so much lately.....|`|N7YeTlGWaa	yeh im like that  theres nothing wrong with you  and please dont listen to that guy  its deffinitly not cancer so dont be worried  i only used to eat little bits of fruit a day for round a bout a month  your body gets used to hardly eating anything   and gets used to it  so i wouldnt worry at all!  even sometimes i forced myself to eat  a meal and i almost puked   because my body wasn't used to it  so it made me feel a bit ill,  dont worry about it,  if you are just see your doctor,  and tell them that your worried  and i promise it will be fine and   they will put you at ease!

The only clone in the market for the Xenadrine RFA-1 with ephedra is the Zenalean Pro.  What overweight women and men have learned is that for years virtually every professional bodybuilder, informed fitness expert and successful personal trainer would tell you the same thing. Whether you want to accelerate the burning of excess body fat, boost your metabolic rate, heighten your thermogenic output or increase your energy level, there is nothing stronger or more effective than the "thermogenic cocktail" of Ephedra, Caffeine, and Aspirin (The E/C/A- Stack").

mBMpQKKJaa	defo sounds like an infection of some kind. You say it came after your period finished, is there any chance you may have left the last tampon you used in your period up there. Really try and remember as this can cause toxic shock, which is very dangerous. If you can't find a "lost" tampon, then you really do need to see a doctor to find out what is causing it. Good luck    (to check for a missing tampon, sorry TMI! you have to put your finger right in to the top, it may be lodged right by your cervix, it will not be sitting where it usually sits, with the string hanging down, you literally have to "scoop" it out, sorry it is gross! Other than that a doctor will spot it straight away and remove it)|`|jB5cMnGFaa	I do remember sort of going thru that when i was roughly your age-possibly 17..I never went to the Dr. I was too embarassed!!

I personally hate tampons and think that is what caused mine..not all women can wear them-i have tons of allergies...possibly even though you say it stops the smell it is also prolonging the infection?? try douching and then wearing pads just a couple times and see if that helps :) I just remembered-my breasts also became very large and spider-webbed like stretch marks--indicating a maturity and change in the body...perhaps your body is just adjusting to maturing?|`|aeiP74PLaa	is it coming from ur pousy or ur butt could be diarrea cuz i mean the butt is right next to the pousy...

737e8ad896c16931d3da06dca8c8e2b4aa	It sounds like you are not getting proper digestion of your food. This can have many causes. One of the most common is Celiac disease which is an inability to digest gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye barley and oats. The gluten coats and disables the small intestine.    If you live in the US you will find doctors very unfamiliar or reluctant to offer this diagnosis without milking as much money out of you as they can. If you live in Europe you are luckier.    There are of course many other possibilities and you should find a competent doctor if the symptoms are chronic|`|eicQTpKyaa	food borne illness or diarrhea? that happened to me once too (the growling part)  the weird part was that i didn't really feel it i could only hear it!  are you thin?  i have a cousin who is pretty thin & her stomach always growls...  her friend is really thin too and it always growls also...  maybe thats it...?|`|a2ol5COXaa	I'm not sure,  but i think you should go to a doctor,  just to check it out.    you can never know for sure until you get professional help
fXghMWPCaa	Well i have this same problem!! There are a few things you can do...maybe watch less tv and do some more exercises? If you really LOVE watching tv and having something to nibble on why not replace unhealthy snacks like chips, dips etc with something healthy like fruit, or veggies or even a low fat wafer bread with some cream cheese and a small slice of salmon. Another useful tip is, when you think yyou'refeeling hungry go have a big glass of water and then wait 10 minutes..sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger. Still hungry> Now go get a healthy snack. As long as you aaren'tOVEREATING during the day a small snack wont effect your weight loss too much. The important thing to do is make sure that you stay within your caloric intake needed to lose weight.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	Drink more water.

H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. Inflammation of the sinuses is often associated with hay fever and asthma. Symptoms include a sense of heaviness behind the nose and eyes, often resulting in a "sinus headache." If the sinuses are infected, there may be fever and nasal discharge. Antihistamines and decongestants may be helpful in cases of sinusitis that accompany colds or hay fever.  Don't use nasal sprays for more than three days. For recurring sinusitis, consult a doctor to determine the precise cause and treatment; a course of antibiotics is frequently prescribed. And good luck.|`|4XcmCKPbaa	take an asprin, it may be a head ache

If she isn't taking any contraceptives and is having sex, then there's always the possibility of getting pregnant. However, remember that birth control pills are basically hormones and trick your body into thinking it's already pregnant. It makes sense that, sometimes, it may take a while for her body to get back into its natural cycle (which is typically 3-4 weeks on average).    The only sure way to know, though, is to see a doctor.

Sure people may buy things, go somewhere or even have sex to feel good, but the pleasure wears off, and later people feel empty again, unhappy and not fulfilled.     If the richest person in the world had everything they ever wanted, in the end of the day, they would be unhappy because they have everything.     Same with the poor and the middle class, we always want more, but like I said before it can never be filled by anything that we get in this world.     I feel your pain, and I am sorry for you. Do you want to be happy? Not depressed and have that thirst for more quenched?     My advice to you is to go find god.|`|AA11492002	We all feel lonely from time to time and most families are badly out to lunch. Gosh, I wish my family was there for me when I was younger, my parents felt their job was done by living in a good school district. I never got any meaningful advice or support for activities like team sports. I fixed this with my kids but most parents tend to repeat their dysfunctional upbringing.    Try not to make let this feeling dominate your life... instead just get out and start doing things.. read to the children at the local library, usually there is a set time. Read a book, sign up for team sports, girl scouts, other "geekish" group activities or after school groups.     Take an active roll in your life, it is that simple.

DDkkwPcPaa	Hi    Firstly I would find a mutual place, one where the step father would not know where they are and what they are doing, secondly, I would seek professional help i.e. Social Services, these people are fully trained to do this, I would also make sure that the Mother is made fully aware of what was going on, with the abuse and what you and your friend are planning on doing, as this behind her back may be seen as a stab in the back, I am not sure of the situation of how amicable the mother is, but it has to be a softly, softly approach, and it may be the case that the mother may not believe her daughter at first, but this might to be expected, but make sure at that point that she knows, also the Girls Aunt's, Uncle's or other Adult relatives maybe able to help, even with accommodation if needed, it is absolutely right that you should seek help, speak to the Mum first, and hopefully she makes sure that the step Dad is punished.    Personnally I would help where I can, I would follow my friends lead, and allow her to make the choice of  what she is going to do. Just support her the best you can, and try not to take this on yourself, many of us think that we help, but go into things too deeply and find that we are on the receipt of Personal attack.    Your friend has to want to take it further than her Mum, she is asking for your total support on this and this is what I feel you must give her.    Also I would advise her to seek medical help, for any Mental issues that may be contributing to her feelings.    Hope this helps  Nick G|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Thank goodness she has come forward with this.  I would suggest that both of you go to your school counselor and tell him or her they are trained to deal with this. She really, really has to tell her mother.  You can get some professional advice and help from a crisis intervention numer there are two of them whom you can talk to at anytime they can tell you how to go about doing this.  One is 1-800-273-talk and another is 1-800-833-5948.  Please don't let her change her mind about telling her mom.  If her mom doesn't do anything than she needs to call Child Protective Services.  Your friend will need therapy as this can cause lifelong emotional and mental damage. This can affect the rest of her life in a bad way without therapy.  My best to you and your friend. You are doing the right thing. You are a very good friend by wanting to help her. She does need help, more than you think.
0YTuN71aaa	It's just to make sure you are not pregnant at the start of the course of treatment.  Then as you go along, you'll be given pregnancy tests every month, along with liver function tests.    If you're not sexually active at all, it doesn't really matter when you start it.

I waited it out but it seemed to take around 3 months for the pain to fully go away because I didn't want to go to the doctor.

1kQllt04aa	I have a very over-active imagination so, sometimes I see faces in the the shadows or marks on the walls etc. Some look like little demons.

Still fun though.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Seems like you might be afraid of the dark, you seem paranoid about something. You seem to be scared of something. Crying is from sadness of something that might of occurred or depression. Try to see someone to help you figure this out. Could you have been abused as a young child.?
XZlFLecLaa	i used to get like that.... go to your room shut the door. put the corner of your pillow in your mouth ... bite down hard...  then shake your head back and forth really fast then release ... and tada! out comes the tooth!    only do it when the tooth is really loose ready to come out , otherwise it may hurt      good luck!|`|kQStNgzUaa	Go see a dentist-a good one. Trust me-you will be glad you did. Tell them to use a lot of novocaine, and you won't feel anything.|`|XrViVeqPaa	My grandmother used to tie fishing line around my loose tooth, then tie the other end around a door knob. Then she slammed the door. Believe it or not, it worked. Numerous times.|`|8FHj7Ci4aa	My mom used to pull mine out when it JUST started to get loose, and it hurt like hell! Only pull it if it's like super loose. My friend actually lost one of her biting into cookie dough, haha.    Moving on to your question, you can just play with it with your tongue until it decides to fall out on its own. The whole tooth tied to doorknob thing is a classic and honestly works! You can also try just eating non-soft foods (like avoid ice cream, soup, etc) And if none of that works have a trusted buddy do it for ya, hehe. Good luck!!|`|ckzJ8Usdaa	i have the same problem.  i used to do fine with pulling out teeth until an unfortunate event with the dentist. thankfully i got a new one though. i have one more to lose but i just wont seem to come loose.    for my last tooth i lost, it was wiggly for ever but like you, i couldnt bring myself to do it. i had my mom schedule an appointment and my dentist pulled it out for me. it was great. i didnt even feel it because they put laughing gas on and kind of numbed the area. i suggest that if i were you. i may do that for this current wiggly tooth again...    however one of my other teeth was BARELY even loose but i was forced to eat on that side because of a more loose tooth on the other side. i was eating a sloppy joe and it just popped out! completely painfree and i wasnt scared because i didnt think it would even come out. i wouldnt suggest an apple or something though. i wouldnt be able to convince my self to do that.    anyways, just good luck with it and hope that it comes out soon & painlessly :D|`|f25aad84adce1384169ece8fab84ef7faa	The first question I have, is this a permanent tooth?  I worked in a dentist office, I would not be pulling adult teeth.  The best thing you can do is see a dentist -- there are ways to save the tooth.  If you don't have dental insurance or the money, dentists will work with you and help you to set up payment arrangements -- you just need to call around.  If it is a primary tooth, I would just wait until it is really loose, or eat and apple.  Best of luck
eNhVVmG7aa	I think you may have a urinary tract infection, a UTI.  You need to see a doctor or clinic, they'll get you on some antibiotics to take care of things.  Depending on the severity, they may choose to start you out with a shot and then pills.    Don't fool around with this, dear.  It can become much more serious.

After a week or so I went back to my dentist for a checkup and he had to remove them.  They tasted awful the whole time.  I gargled a lot of salt water.|`|F6s5PZBnaa	i had my 4 widsom teeth out nearly 2 weeks ago plus 4 others!

Some of my stiches came out when i was brushing my teeth and just fell out about a week later. I think i have a few little bits still in there so i rekon it takes about 1-2 weeks!
xtUaTVGeaa	Do not let it go on any longer!  You're absolutely right; you can develop anemia and other uncomfortable and potentially dangerous side effects of prolonged menstrual bleeding.  If you're already taking birth control and it's not working, you should definitely see a doctor who'll prescribe you stronger ones to regulate your menstrual cycle. Good luck!|`|OcHJtS2Naa	A friend of mine had her period for 5 months straight.  She finally went to a doctor about it and he switched her to a new birth control.  I'm afraid your only option is to see a doctor.  Best of luck!|`|kUPnINclaa	I definitely know how you feel.  I'm 24 and for the past year and a half I've had constant heavy bleeding and severe pelvic pain.  I saw one OB/GYN who basically told me there was nothing wrong.  I stopped seeing her and went to a specialist.  I have been put on Lupron and although my problems are not completely better, things are starting to improve.  I would definitely recommend that you see a gynecologic specialist as soon as you can.  Have you ever had a laparoscopy?  If not, you should definitely ask your doctor or a new doctor about having one done.  It's a simple surgery with a short recovery time (I've had 2 done in the past year).  Through laparoscopy a doctor can find and remove any endometriosis, cysts, and other problems they might find.  It really sounds to me like you could have endo or something similiar.    If you don't feel like your doctor is taking your problems seriously, find a new doctor!  Your problems need to be taken seriously and solution needs to be found.  I wish you good luck in finding an answer.  I hope this helps!

They stay around for a while.|`|AA12066269	A hickey is broken capillaries confined to a small area usually on the neck.  In the movie Moonstruck Cher's mom referred to it as a love bite.

This creates breakage of the blood vessels and causes either aaa red or brown, semi-circular shape to appear on the skin.
dtzlrB9Faa	I don't know why anyone would want to have sex while having an outbreak.  A condom is not necessary but it might be painful and spread to the other partner.    No need to wear condoms if you both have it and agree not to wear condoms.|`|UspK4SQBaa	They need to have protected sex (monogamous or not, and outbreak or not), but they should wait until there isn't an outbreak.
JEteneuUaa	uh? okay.... congrats!|`|K4zsztkRaa	So your foreskin is too tight?    You were right about doing the stretching, that helps, but now you just tore your foreskin. What's going to happen is as it heals it will fill in with scar tissue and your skin will become tighter. I don't know if you can still stretch it out as well now, you might have created a big problem for yourself.    What I would do is wait till it heals fully. Then go back to stretching it everyday, but make sure you aren't in any pain otherwise you are tearing the skin again. If it doesn't work and it's still too tight then go to the doctor and get some steroid creams to do with the stretching. They help alot my friend used them.      -Connor|`|7mCCAqXzaa	Spartin dude you may have had the skin attached to the head and tore it off not a big deal as long as the skin pulls back on your unit easy then your okay it as long as it isnt gushin blood it will heal. remember in the shower to allways pull the skin back and clean it with soap and water so it doesnt stink     curtdude|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yeah you just forced it back which is why it's hurting and you have a sore on the top. If you let it heal it should be okay. Then keep stretching it back slowly each day, no forcing it!    Harriet|`|CNW6eAjoaa	Well, you have your answers from the other contributors.  I have posted a link that has to do with stretching a tight foreskin.  In there, you will read not to overstretch a tight foreskin as you can cause micro tears in the opening.  These micro tears and any other damage you do to the skin heals over with non elastic scar tissue.  To much of this scar tissue will hamper your retraction ability.  As what all responders have said, go easy and take your time.  Let the scar or wound heal and always stretch without pain.    Afterthought!  I am only partially retarded|`|2SSD6BP9aa	Sounds like you hadn't completely retracted your foreskin yet when you yanked it back then.  You just pulled a bit more of it than you should have at one time.  Usually it's loosened bit by bit.  But don't worry, you haven't done any permanent harm.    You shouldn't have to stop masturbating like some are saying.  Besides masturbating is the best way to loosen the rest of it so it can fully retract.  Just don't yank back too hard on it all at once.    Loosening a foreskin should be done in baby steps.|`|0iJSa2c1aa	What exactly is your question?|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	You're OK. Just keep choking your "chicken" and it will get as loose as a "goose"|`|AlrCZJ3saa	Go to a doctor, next thing you know your going to start pissing black urine.|`|G5oc6APhaa	the exposed head of your penis has been exposed and damaged. This is why we have a foreskin to protect it.|`|QBUypAmAaa	You pulled a little too far it sounds, just let it heal up and don't masturbate for a few days. If it's not healed by a week, go visit the GP/doctor; however, if your doctor says anything about circumcision get out of there and find another doctor, preferably one that understand the intact penis and foreskin, and one that won't automatically jump to the conclusion of circumcision just because he does not know how to care for an intact penis. Circumcision should be a last resort option only for emergencies.|`|72iZuDjeaa	i'll bet it was quite a scare at that!... you didn't mention if it retracted after that little drama... i hope it did... that would be painful to beat the band i'm sure... get some steroidal cream from the doctor and go back to your stretching exercises|`|Cy9mMf4gaa	just let it heal and don't masturbate for awhile.|`|OWOtKZmgaa	be a little more gentle and apply some neutrogenar cream to the area you damaged and it should heal up ok  .as the others state you should not consider circumcision if your doc recommends it to alleviate such a small problem, creating a huge surgical trauma will only cause you more   stress and major pain.persevere easing the slight problem you have it will improve|`|2lKvVtIyaa	I don't mean to be a retard.

0e7f6e71b646cc0274701ac48a120880aa	Don't worry.  These people who are telling you to go to the hospital are being a little dramatic.      Hives are just a sign of an allergic reaction or stress.  If it was life-threatening, you would know it by now.    I went to the emergency medical clinic because I got a bad case of hives and had never had them before.  He just gave me a topical cream and an antibiotic (in case it was a skin infection -- it wasn't).  I took these medications that cost me over $30 and it turns out all I needed was a Zyrtec.      I still don't know the cause of my allergies.  I've been reading up on it and apparently many people never find the allergens causing their hives.  Might be your detergent or fabric softener, soap, lotion, shampoo. . . Especially if you've switched recently.  I'd try using anything you can that does not have dyes in it.  Hypoallergenic.

I wouldn't eat either unless it was the only thing standing between hunger and me and it was a long time until my next meal. (Or I'm at a restaurant that served vegetarian sushi and it was about the only thing decent on the menu.)
sQu3LLqtaa	Binging on prunes, oranges or mandarins will help or if you are really desperate castor oil will help.    For a permanent solution you need more fiber and that means more fruit and vegetables.  There is also plenty of fiber in bread, cereals, pasta and rice.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	eat more vegetables|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Getting enough water, and enough fiber (by eating enough whole grains, green vegetables, etc.). For occasional use, (real) prune juice and orange juice can help. For more ideas check out: http://best-constipation-cures.com/const...|`|tbFI2XJeaa	Add several servings of fibrous whole grains, fruits (such as prunes or prune juice) and vegetables to your diet every day or opt for a fiber supplement. Fiber adds bulk to the intestines and creates well-formed stools that are easier to pass. Or try searching for homeopathic remedies products that will help you to overcome constipation naturally.|`|C2M2StR1aa	I have one trick that I tell my clients about that works very well.  Jumping on a mini-trampoline or rebounder will help with constipation.  It will work almost immediately if it is going to.    I have posted a page on constipation at my website below.    Chronic constipation can be an indication of health problems to come.  It is wise to work on eliminating :) it.    Good luck and good health.|`|siHW10dCaa	Marie, try drinking a glass of apple juice every morning, if this doesn't seem to work,  take a one or two quart warm water enema, works every time.|`|x5GMWHRdaa	crackers, bread ect anything with fiber in it|`|p5wzfp4Faa	fibre- all bran, bran flakes, fresh fruit

0lG71HNIaa	i would take your brother to the dentist because at 5 he is no where near ready to loose his teeth, any of them! you could have caused him severed trauma which can cause the pulp and root to die slowly which will make him in need of a root canal.     a common thing people say with kids is "oh they are going to lose their teeth anyway" but although its true they still need proper care and treatment. get him in and have them check it out, they may not charge you anything at all and then you will have peace of mind knowing he is ok.|`|tnKdyC5naa	yes, it will be fine, it will take a while for the tooth to grow back because the tooth wasnt ready to come out, but it could take about 1-2 years to grow back in, but it will... trust me :)|`|1LcSsHpzaa	yeah, he'll be fine. the pressure compact from your knee crashing into his tooth just caused his gum to bleed since the tooth might have pushed into the gum too hard.|`|IDVFsy5waa	Yes it will be okay. it will grow back in okay after it falls out. dont worry!|`|IiiXQwsIaa	it will be just fine my tooth is doing the same
72iZuDjeaa	don't do anything that you feel might strain your back... get professional advice before starting any lifting program...|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Just stand around all day and do nothing.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	I'm sorry I don't have any links. But I know the rule. That is if you are picking something up that has any weight to it you always bend your knees down and pick it up in that position. This puts weight on your lower body and takes the weight and pressure off of your back. If you every work in a job that requires lifting you are always shown a safety film showing exactly this to protect your back from injury.|`|Ch0squPxaa	Stop trying to suck your own penis|`|4MtR8MLpaa	Check out this orthopedics web site.

Those guys wanted to sleep around before they bulked up, the muscles just gave them the confidence to do it.|`|G6Uy43coaa	If they took off the "muscular" part, wouldn't the statement still be true?|`|3nZ8l8Jyaa	Yes I do believe this. I have been hit on more times at the gym than in the bar but of course I do go to the gym more than the bar. The dudes at the gym watch you like vultures and try picking you up by offering to do alternating sets on the weight machines. I have never had a fling or a date with anyone from my gym by my own personal choice.
b8687384f699254fcb8cec5e4b6f8a78aa	i had an aneurysm rupture in 1972 had surgery fully recovered. another aneurysm in2001 and 2007 both times had clips put in. recovered  both times enough to go back to regular job. still working a full time and part time job. so YES recovery is possible.|`|U7oJrc3faa	Well my one of my friends had hemorrhaging in his brain...and he's perfectly fine!    An aneurysm isn't exactly normal...if she had one another may form in the future.|`|mAp90hEeaa	In most circumstances, clipping the area dramatically decreases her chances of this area rupturing.  Clipping shuts off the blood supply to the problem vessel so the chances of future rupture is low in this area.  Unless she has some congenital vascular problem, this surgery should be considered a cure and she should be able to have a normal lifespan without further problems.  Most aneurysms are isolated incidences and without an underlying vascular abnormality throughout her body, she should not have another one. It is rare that people have to have multiple brain aneurysms surgically corrected.  Her biggest risk will be getting through the surgery to take care of this problem because any surgeries have their inherent risks associated with them.
xxq5JAM6aa	There are more nutrients and fiber in whole grain rice than in polished rice. Brown rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice, meaning it doesn't cause as much of an increased in your insulin level.    Rice is a good source of carbohydrates and calories. Good for quick energy and glycogen production, but not good for weight loss or muscle gain. Protein much better for that.|`|K4zsztkRaa	It will do nothing for you, for muscle gain.  But rice is very good for you.  Brown rice is even better. but it won't help you with muscle.  only protien will do that.  And you have to make sure you are getting the right amount of protien everyday, to build muscle.  And youhave to make sure you are eating low fat things, especially low fat meats.    -Connor
W2z5dCrmaa	The concern is not toward having a six pack, but instead of a concern toward lifting too much weight and damaging the growth plated in the joints of your legs, be it knees, hips or ankles.    Go to Google or Yahoo and check out growth plated....it gives it all in a way that will make lots of sense to you.    Starting sit ups and crunches at an early age is awesome because your body shape and light weight makes them so easy. It's almost like no work at all. As you keep doing them with body growth and development, it never does become a chore.    Look into Ahf for men...as in American health and fitness for men and pick a good exercise of sit-ups and crunches and go with it. There is no way that it will hurt you. Good abs is tough to get to, so if you start now when it's east for you, ur good for life!    Good luck younger Dude, and ur going to look awesome!    Me! :- )|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	It is not advisable to start lifting weights before age 16 - to give your muscles a chance to grow & mature before you begin to try making them bigger.  Get off junk food & fast food garbage & sugary sweet soda's.  Eat plenty of boiled or steamed vegetables.  Drink plenty of water & milk.  Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner.  Whenever possible, you can try to work in sit ups, pull ups, push ups & skipping rope.|`|AA11785060	Pure fiction about the idea that boys who exercise will get stunted or something to that effect.  Working out is exercise.  Guys need to exercise since we no longer have to labor like our forefathers did.  100 yrs ago kids worked from sun up to sun down, and worked hard from an early age through their teens. No one thought that hard work would stunt a guy.  And lifting feed sacks or hay bales is no different than lifting weights or other exercise. All develop and use the muscles.  Do what ever you want to do, sit ups work best for developing the abs, and there are some kids your age or younger who can do over a 1000 a day. I'd not go for that record, though.  Sounds like a waste of too much time.|`|wKg4vZbuaa	thats NOT true...since when is it NOT healthy to have a healthy athletic body?!|`|48Yf8tpsaa	We are not all genetically predisposed to expose a six pack... but we all have abs... just that some of us have them covered by a layer of fat.    The only reason it would be unhealthy to have exposed abs is if your body fat levels are so low that you cannot fight off a disease should you get one... (the fat is used for energy to repair your body). Anyway, if you are healthy and athletic, it's not unhealthy to have exposed 6 pack.    To get lean you need ot eat lots of vegetables preferably raw... nuts and berrys, fresh fruit, lean grass fed meat.. no take away.. no soda... you know.. eat a very healthy and small meal .. eat something at least 6 times a day so your body doesnt cling onto fat.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	Some guys just have it so I cannot see why there is anything wrong with it.  Just don't let it become an obsession.  Diet:  Avoid too much fat especially animal fat.  Take in a good quantity of protein without neglecting the other food groups.  A six pack will only show if you don't carry fat.  Sit-ups are amongst the best ab builders.  You need to do all muscle groups though for a well tones body.  Swimming is excellent for muscles toning as well as good broad shoulders.  To look like a body builder you will have to do serious weights.  you only need to use weights for resistance training.  Look on the web for a good programme.|`|O80zDeY2aa	well, from what you just said it sounds like you're in pretty good shape. And you are young. you're 13, but you are tall.. taller than me. and im a sophomore.. its sad. T.T. Ok, back to the point, first do some ab toning. the typical sit ups,etc. do push ups and do some yoga. yoga improves flexibility and strength.  i recommend beach body from tony horton. the abs dvd, is really good. but in general, keep what you're doing right now. you still have time to get the six pack. :] good luck.

tICAenjeaa	1.) i have this cleaner and i love it!  not only is it cheaper than other brands but it makes your face feel refreshed and soooo soft after words unlike any other kind of cleanser (and believe me i've tried them all!!)  -although it DOESN'T get RID of acne it helps to prevent it and clear away dead skin cells....so dont think of it as an acne cleanser.    2.) sorry i dont have this cleanser but if i were you i would read up on what it does, look at what brand it is to make sure it's pretty reliable and try it for a week. If it doesn't work then most likely it wont make a big impact in the future.  (it also has a lot to do with your skin type)  (=  good luck!  hope i helped|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	It will all depend on your own skin for the answer ( 2)  and the scrub may get rid of dead skin cells and make black heads surface - they do make an acne brand - otherwise I think it stirs up acne prone skin - if you don't have acne then it should be fine once or twice a week on a clean face.
kzbEWqgLaa	you may have appendicitis.... go to webmd and use their symptom checker.... If appendicitis comes up then that may very well be your problem|`|3RHSSEDnaa	Time to try an alternative.

GXiCrhVYaa	First of all, there are over a dozen other medications to treat Tourette's Syndrome besides Haldol. You mentioned your tics are severe, so I assume that is why your doctor thought that Haldol was the best med for you. Please remember you have every right to discuss your concerns with your doctor. If he/she seems inflexible and not willing to entertain the idea of a different med, please remember you have a right to a 2nd (or 3rd) opinion. I had to fire loads of shrinks before I found the right one to treat me for major depression.    One of the most common side effects of Haldol is blurred vision. Haldol was approved in 1957 primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It has secondary uses, including Tourette's Syndrome. In the last 50 years, many newer drugs can treat these conditions, often with fewer side effects. That's why I was surprised that Haldol was selected.     Look at the following link, particularly the section marked "Management."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_sy...    The next link is about Haldol. Please don't let all the side effects scare you. Drug manufacturers are required by law to list every side effect ever found. I wish you the best.    http://bipolar.about.com/cs/sfx/a/sfx_ha...
AA11522944	4" is perfect for your age.    The average length of an erect ADULT penis is about 6" (15.2 cm).    Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18.  Remember that growth during puberty often happens in spurts so dont worry if you are a little behind at any particular point... you will probably catch up. Some guys claim that their penis continued to grow until they were in their early 20s.    Approximate erect lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty          2.4 (6 cm)  12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0 (7.6 cm to 10.2 cm)  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0 (10.2 cm to 12.7 cm)  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0 (12.7 cm to 15.2 cm)    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis  http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...|`|lYFiTZHBaa	Dude, for your age, yes.

You should try and get 30 to 45 minutes of exercise in on those days. Cardio should be your main focus right now. That will be the most effective way to start shedding the extra pounds quicker. Walking and then eventually jogging will be good. Jumping rope helps too. When you're watching TV, do some crunches during the commercial breaks. Also, you have to be conscious of what you are eating. Lean protein and veggies are good, as well as complex carbs. The fiber one cereal and  bars helped for me as well. Drink at least 8 to 10 ounces of distilled water too. Adding lemon won't hurt either. Avoid midnight snacks by all means. If you get hungry- grab an apple for a sweet tooth and  pretzels for a salty craving. It' s gonna take time and if you fall off a couple of times- don't get too discouraged. It's a lifestyle change! Good luck!

Eat a lot of carbs and protein. Your body will use these as energy sources and store the excess as fat or muscle depending on your metabolism and energy level. Pasta, breads, nuts, soy, eggs, ect are all good sources of these.    DO exercise. Do some cardio and start a weightlifting routine. Build up your weights over time. Putting on muscle is more efficient and healthier than putting on a bunch of fat.|`|Jzl3sXWMaa	uuh? the oppasite when when your trying to lose wieght??????  but dont get to unhealthy!!!|`|MllSCmIraa	DON'T eat fast food.

kndck79aaa	This depends on what you define "better results" as.  Are you trying to decrease body fat %, or see who builds more muscle mass, etc...    In my opinion, cross fit will increase muscle mass faster than a regular gym regiment.  Your body will also acclimate to the gym routine (and thus plateau faster) than cross fit.  These workouts are used for completely different results, so it's hard to compare them without knowing which results you're looking for.  Cross fit is crazy hardcore madness.  It looks like they're going to have a heart attack when they're finished working out!
YQ9YXcEkaa	Proctology is a field in medicine that deals with disorders of the rectum or anus. Colorectal surgeon is generally the preferred term for them now.  See e.g. http://www.abcrs.org/default.htm    These doctors treat a number of disorders that can range from birth defects to injuries to cancer.  A child would not normally need to see a specialist in this area, but it is possible, particularly if there was some sort of birth defect.

TlHwwnmBaa	Depends what vitamins you are taking. If there is anything with Vitamin B in it take in the morning because you won't be able to sleep.  If you are taking Calcium or Magnesium supplements take them at night.  If you are taking Iron and zinc. take one in the morning and the other in the night because they cancell each other out.  Everyting else you can pretty much take at night.  hope this helps.|`|c319c1f6090c4e43a1d95dd27b249dfeaa	Prob bad because when you take them in the AM, your body has a chance to get plenty of fluids to help digest the vitamin.

31Xl7M5faa	Usually if you go down a band size go up a cup size. They are called sister sizes.  I wear a 32B (fits the best) but I can wear a 34A. The cup size changes depending on the band size.

Sometimes going down a strap size can make the cups tighter as they are pulled back more than usual, so some people just go up a cup size.  It works vice versa too - go to a bigger strap size and some women go down a cup size. Get measured if you can, but if not, then just try on a 32C and see if it feels comfortable.  C cup isn't big for your age don't worry, lots of girls your age are in the same boat.|`|fubLc5HQaa	Hon, you might have to go up a size. Don't worry, I'm 34DD and I'm only 14. I've got friends my age who are DDD. It's normal. Just try on a 32C and see if it fits better. Hope this helps!|`|e7b9d32e1fb4efafbebd927303f7c128aa	The letters on a Bra stand for the difference between the circumference of where the bra band goes, and the circumference (around the body all the way) where the fullest part of the breasts are.    A= 1 inch difference B=2 inch difference C= 3 inch difference and so on.    If the 32 inch band size is right, but the cup is small (breasts are puffed over the bra creating 4 boobs where 2 should be) - then yes, go up a cup size absolutely.  Don't worry about how big you think the letter makes it sound: you are whatever size you are and what matters is the bra fits and offers decent support.    Different bra companies have different sizing standards\names sometimes because they cater to different age groups and body types, don't be surprised if you find yourself having to try on bras before buying them a lot of the time.
qnFju8Z1aa	hey hannah,  thanks for answering my question about the girl issues.  i don't think you have anything to worry about, unless you are thinking that you are overweight.  i have a lot of friends who struggle with self-image and i do myself as well.  it is somewhat correlated to my relationship issues with that girl but that's beside the point.  i'm not saying that you have similar issues, but just be happy with what you've got and exercise if you feel fat or something, that's what i do :)|`|XHvaws8baa	your fine|`|Ji9OCWL4aa	you are at normal weight

vfhKkiSKaa	I tried it years ago and it did nothing for me.    I tried it again a few months ago for my 14 year old son.. again it did absolutely nothing.    At least I could return it and get my money back.    I don't know why it didn't work.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	as is true with any product out there, Proactiv works very well for some and not at all for others.  You can only try and see if it works for you.|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	it does but you have to be patient, it will make you "break out" at first but then will healt it.  what it does is it brings all your acne to surface that you have under your skin and heal all of that, and then once that is healed, if you keep using it you should be good!|`|TiKlwqDEaa	it doesn't work. dont use it!|`|G8IRX295aa	my friend has acne and uses extra strenght proactive and it does not work.|`|xu8J7sQiaa	idk|`|aBWT7SbMaa	its aite, there better stuff, proactiv is just most largly advertised|`|1NzCH71Haa	It works just fine.|`|kYHWpK5Laa	i hear it doesnt|`|nON6Qdwpaa	my friends have used it and some said yes many said no  i used it for awhile and it dryed my face out like crazy and it was very inconsistant    i recently started SkinID...and i love it|`|uEYckSYVaa	i use it myself and i have jut started.  i was a bit skeptical about it working and i am not just saying this but it does make quite a difference,   however do not give up because at the start it can make your skin a bit worse, all products do, its called like 'bringing it all to the surface' then you get rid of it and voila  try it   i love it :)|`|6w0f7hlQaa	No, Its only alcohol. It will only dry you out like all the other store bought stuff that is cheaper. That can work if you have minor acne.    But other than that, go to a dermatologist and get a real medicine. It will do waaaaay more for your acne.|`|WcurY9Mtaa	I have never tried it...but don't forget all those commercials...they se photo shop|`|C1DsQsWlaa	Really, it all depends on your skin type. Most of my friends have tried Proactive and said it did not work at all!! They said it made their acne 10x worse than it was before. My cousin also used and she said it worked sometimes, then it stopped working and it was way too expensive. I don't have acne, but you should check out something called Skin ID. Its suppose to give you products specified for your skin type.|`|AA11620985	At the beginning you will notice a change, for the better . However, after awhile your skin gets used to it and does not help with the break outs . Also, everything that it lists that it helps , black heads , white heads , breaks outs , you will only notice that your acne is vanishing . Try something that will dry your face out , so that ance is harder to form .|`|RfuAqRhpaa	I used proactiv for 6 months, and it made no positive impact on my skin. If anything my acne got worse over that time, that may have happened whether i was using proactiv or not, but yeah.  My skin got really dry after using it for about two weeks, but not a healthy dry. My skin was flaking and felt really rubbery.  Of course this product works differently for different people, but for me it didn't work.  At the moment i am using a product called Benzol Poroxide which is also in Proactiv. So i have been using that for a cream and have been cleansing my face with Cetaphil. This has made a huge improvement! :D    Good luck!|`|eE8IcMmqaa	I've used Extra Strength Proactiv for almost a year now and my skin is ok...

QsD9VOMYaa	I'll tell you about my own personal experience with periods. They are soooo PAINFUL, that it makes me vomit (cause I cant handle the pain), I get all tired, but at the same time I can't stay sitting/lying down because I'm in too much pain. I get hot flashes, and I get dizzy, and lose my appetite till the end of my periods. This all lasts for the first 2 days of my period.    A week after my periods are over, PMS starts with bloating, painful breasts, moodiness and on/off cramps, followed by my periods again!!!    They really do SUCK!!!!!!!|`|aCLqYRtEaa	it doesnt hurt its just annoying and a pain. and it feels gross. and you have to like go to the br a lot during school and ughh not funn your lucky hun|`|qbelhflAaa	It feels disgusting.

Kind of just like an inconvenient thing you know is there but you don't really pay it any attention.
mhLaOFZRaa	Meanmom posted:For sinus, I really like PLAIN sudephed (which you must ask the pharmicist for - but its not prescription)    I agree, the over the counter Sudafed does not work due to the change they made in the formula of the medication. You must ask the Pharmicist for the regular Sudafed and you have to provide your drivers license as it is now a controlled substance. They put your name in their computer so you don't buy to much of it in a month or they will think you are making drugs at home.   It still is the best thing for sinus problems they have on the market.    Also microwave about a cup of water to disenfect it, and add a teaspoon of salt to it and set aside to cool down to warm. Use a paper cup (crease the top side) and you can pour a little of it into the right side of your nose and let it drain out the other side. Then repeat on the left side. Do this several times.   If you have a dropper you can use that instead or some people just put some of the water in the palm of their hand and suck it into the nose on each side.    Then use some of the water to gargle your throat as this will help the head also.    Massage and put pressure around each side of your nose and on each side of the bridge of your nose, along the bone under your eyes, on the bone where your eyebrows are located, and on the temple area. If you feel any place above your ears or around the front area of your head then massage that area also. You can sometimes feel the pressure released from your sinus.    Don't think it is a sinus infection since you don't have a fever and your discharge is not yellow or green, but you do need to get it to drain before it becomes an infection. The sinus passage is very small and when it gets swollen the sinuses can't drain and then you have problems.|`|u5F22mEbaa	Not sure where you live, but in the San Francisco Bay Area, there is a cold/flu thing going around that comes with a nasty headache - both my son and I had it, and there is nothing that works for a day or two.

Hope you feel better soon|`|foeRCrStaa	a- see a doctor   b-try tylenol cold and sinus it works great for me and I get whoppers.  c-also try lying in a dark room with a cold wet towel over your eyes (this covers some of the sinus area) this also has worked for me.|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	go in a walk in clinc or yur doctor.  theywill give yu some meds & tell yu wahs really wrong.

I have no idea how long i keep them flexed. or whatever.|`|Mkroj9gPaa	how can your abs always be flexed without you actually doing something to make them be flexed? i dont think its possible. flexing them for a few mins at a time would be toning them, not training them to always be flexed.|`|bi9EsTReaa	NO lol thats really funny|`|3hPGBoZGaa	No, when muscles are flexed they contract and will hence automatically extend upon relaxation.  Keeping muscles flexed too long may speed up atrophy and may strain it.|`|RGirTKcRaa	Well considering I do this I will say it is not automatic but it will train you to naturally hold in your stomach muscles. I do it "Naturally" But It is a force of habit now. and I have been doing it since childhood.    I have a flat stomach and It is probably my best feature bellow my neck.  I am somewhat sure instilling this habbit has contributed to me keeping away my beer gut ^_^    At the very least it will give you a little work out.Some times I have to remind my self to relax and not do it so  some thing to think about before you start any new habits|`|GmTs1BB1aa	lol i highly doubt it|`|5nfqY9T7aa	No, but it will definitely give them a good workout!

5kXxr6r0aa	well obviously there's a slight chance that they might possibly be damaged somehow, you can never rule that out, but assuming that your abs are tough enough to safely take whatever punishment the "puncher" is dishing out, i'd say it wouldn't do anything really.    there's two possible things, some bodybuilders do some workouts (not exactly workouts but still training) where they'll try and flex as long as they can or under as much stress as they can (a.k.a. Rocky movies). This allows them to hold a flex for a longer period of time with less of a chance of a cramp coming up.    along the lines of strength, endhurance, size, and definition, it really doesn't do all that much.|`|f7d9B16Jaa	well they tense and get tougher|`|2Rpvrnnmaa	Damages them.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Give this free cognitive behavioral therapy program a try:    http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome    It's kind of funny and it seems like it will be helpful (I've only done lesson 1 so far).  Maybe if you work thru this program, you will learn to calm yourself down by not having extreme thoughts that are leading to very anxious emotions.    I'm going to add that about 1/2 of people who have a mental illness have NO IDEA they have a mental illness. This is called "lacking insight" and that's why in the most extreme cases (this isn't you!) they have involuntary treatment.  In your case, maybe you should ask a couple of close friends what they think - get some more opinions, from people who know you well.  These psychiatrists see a LOT of people & they're pretty good at spotting things, so don't blow off your doctor's opinion.

F8tQkDPcaa	There are 2 programs out there that are famous for treating Panic Attacks and Anxiety successfully.  They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.    You may wonder, "Which one is better?" Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.  Linden Method is more for those who aren't really good in coping their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.    Check out the reference for the full UNBIASED comparison and review.

iAv9P3HTaa	Cut the sweet and cut the fatty junk.  If you have a six pack and you wanna maintain it you gotta live a certain way,with other words you gonna have to live a certain lifestyle.  You gotta be devoted.  Work out at least 4 days a week 1 hour hardcore regime.  Work out hard and you have to enjoy it otherwise you will not get far.    here are the best exercises for hard core abs:    Side Bends    * Holding a dumbbell in you right hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.  * Place your left hand behind your head and slowly bend sideways to your right lowering the dumbbell down to your knee.  * Return to an upright position and repeat for the desired number of reps.    Medicine Ball Sit Ups    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (choose a 5 pound ball to begin) to your chest and have a partner stand at your feet (not on them).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * As you curl up throw the ball to your partner. Hold the crunch as your partner catches the ball and throws it back to you.  * Catch the ball and slowly return to the start position.  * Tip: Don't sit right the way up as you wait for the return pass. Your shoulders should be no more than 6 inches off the floor.    Weighted Curls with Medicine Ball    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (or weight plate) to your chest (start with 5 pounds).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * Curl up just enough to lift both your shoulders off the floor a few inches.  * Hold for a count of 2 and return to the start position.    Cable Crunch    * This exercise requires a triceps pushdown machine with a rope attachment.  * Knee down in font of the machine holding the rope just above your head.  * Slowly crunch down to your right knee and hold for 2 seconds as you breathe out.  * Return to the start position slowly and repeat to the left knee.    Abdominal Exercise Guidelines  Perform several (3-5) abdominal exercises 3-5 times a week. Start with exercises and repetitions that are comfortable for your fitness level and as you improve increase the number of repetitions. You do not need to do all the exercises; simply select those that work well for you and vary your routine over the months.    best

OCxkv2bNaa	I'm not saying I would know, considering I'm not even in college yet, but it sounds like you are drifting away from your past, or at least that's what your mom thinks. Just tell her that your okay blah blah and that if you sound tired it's just because you've been studying a lot. Even if it doesn't convince her, at least she'll probably get the point that you're the same as when you left home and that you're not going to OD, burn the college down, or join a cult.     As for the party, yeah, don't go. They can go their way, and you can go yours. It sounds like you have changed, and your friends haven't. Now you feel weird because you can't relate to them. Try to make new friends that enjoy snowshoeing, making random campfires, or other stuff you enjoy while at the same time keeping your original friends. That's what I did. I used to be pretty passive, just being like "I know you. We have always been friends. I guess you are my friend even though I don't actually know-know you."     Then I became more social and more myself and actually made more FRIENDSHIPS with people that had similar interests as me and that I could actually TALK to and joke about being nerds with. That probably sounds kind of mean, not realistic, and maybe not your type of problem, but it really helped me realize that there is no wall between me and life, just a bubble around myself that I needed to burst by letting everyone around me know who I really am. There are people out there for you. Don't worry about a girlfriend. She will come. Just be really open to people, and maybe after that pesky wolf steals your snowshoes while you were in your tent, you'll meet someone at the snowshoe store whose snowshoe's got stolen by a wolf, too. Conversation topic....    I hope this long list of words is helpful, even if it only raises your copability quotient by a gazinagooplexieth of a point. GOOD LUCK!|`|CBfGXLvKaa	Sounds like your just more mature than your friends and tired of the partying- not calling them immature for partying just saying some people arent the partying type! And maybe your just annoyed with the same old questions. Dont beat yourself up :)|`|fOzP3CmWaa	I was exactly the same all through college. Everyone wanted to go out, get drunk, and then waste away the next day by being hung over. At first I felt like there was something wrong with me, but then I just realized that that was not my thing.     Now that I'm out of college I have a good job, a good relationship, and I'm happy as can be staying at home playing games and watching movies with my boyfriend. Those friends of mine who were going out and getting drunk every night are still doing the same thing to this day (even though they are supposed to be adults). And guess what, they are the ones who are jealous of me because I have my act together and everything is going so good for me.     There is nothing wrong with being responsible. It sounds like you know how to have a different kind of fun (snow shoeing, etc,), which is so much more desirable than a hang-over. Trust me, you are not the only one who has this mind set and I think you are very mature for not wanting to meet a bikini wearing girl at a house party. I'm sure you will find a nice, mature, respectful ad responsible girl some day to hang out at home with on those nights when everyone else is out being crazy!!     The best part is they will all be jealous of you!!!|`|AA11565057	You're not the only kid with this mindset. It's really just that those people aren't ones you would encounter as often because they're probably at home reading a good book, doing their studies, or hanging out with friends. If most of your social circle are party animals, you can be forgiven for thinking everyone is like that. They really aren't!    You don't have to go to the party. That's fine.    I think that your mother asking you what's wrong may be misinterpreted by you. When people have anxiety, they are likely to interpret neutral or positive events in a negative manner. Perhaps you DID sound tired. Does it matter? My mother notices if I sound different to usual and asks me if I'm ok and that's fine. You're way over the top on that one. So WHAT if she's thinking it? How on earth should that have a negative impact on you? So someone thinks you sound tired and/or frustrated - who cares? Does it really change who you are? I think you need to work on interpreting life events a little differently. It's never the events that matter, it's how one responds to them. You can respond in a positive manner to the things you have talked about. It just takes time and practise, preferably with the assistance of a Psychologist.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Count me as another in your box. My parents' favorite topic for most of my life was "what's wrong with you, here's what you really need, and why don't you...."  Arggghhh!     OK, big deal so your mother thinks you're tired. She could be thinking a lot worse.    Party? Forget it. Too many folks these days go out to drink and party, and oh, if they have fun in the process, then that's a mere side effect. Used to be people would go out for a good time, and if they drank and other things, they were the byproducts of the good times.    Do what YOU want, be WHO you want, and screw everybody else.
nvpZS2YXaa	I know that you've probably heard the aloe vera thing A LOT...believe me...but it really does help if you keep reapplying it. If you store it in the fridge, it can give you more of a relief when you first put it on.    Mix a half-water, half-vinegar solution and apply it to the burn with a spray bottle or soaked cloth. This will sting a little bit at first, but it definitely pulls the burning sensation out of your sunburn.    Ice packs (in small amounts of time) and cold cloths or compresses will also help to minimize the length of time that you have redness and should help with the swelling.    Take lukewarm (room temperature) BATHS. Taking showers with too high of a water pressure could increase your pain. Taking a too-cold bath won't help, and will make you freezing. And a too-hot bath runs the risk of burning you even more, or irritating the burn that you already have.    Make sure that you drink PLENTY of water, in order to keep your body hydrated so you don't develop a fever. If you do develop a fever, take an acetaminophen or an ibuprofen to help get rid of the fever and to minimize inflammation and swelling.    If your sunburn is really bad and seems to be very painful, you may want to go see your doctor and get a prescriptive treatment.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Aloe-based products soothe and cool overheated skin. ALOE VERA is a natural and soothing treatment option for sunburn and tan. Just pluck a few leaves of the plant, mash them and mix with lemon juice. Apply all over the affected areas. It cleanses, clears and nourishes the skin. Check out   http://solutionsforsunburn.blogspot.com/ for more details.|`|RFGcIvhJaa	Get some tylenol in her to control the overnight fever. No quick fix, just keep the skin moisturized.|`|mAp90hEeaa	There is no way to get rid of sunburn overnight.  The skin is damaged and now has to heal itself which takes 1-2 weeks before this process is done.  A moisturizer or something with aloe in it is soothing and taking some tylenol regularly will also help with the discomfort.  Next time, do some prevention so this won't happen again.|`|RUmNeAqYaa	Bath in milk|`|nhGorPBoaa	If you go to the pharmacy they can give you cream that is better than over-the-counter after-sun cream.

AA11432707	My primary job as an anesthesiologist is to keep my patient alive. The stress of surgery combined with the drugs I give impact almost every system in the body, and it's my job to monitor and control those systems.    It took me 12 years to get the knowledge and skills to do that, so I can't really explain it all here.  A lot of anesthesia is resuscitation - fluid management, heart rate and blood pressure control, and management of ventilation.  On top of that, I have to keep the patient comfortable and the surgeon happy (providing optimal operating conditions).

Vpk1nP7gaa	eyes fatigue|`|H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. Severe pain behind the eye may result from migraine headaches, and pain either above or below the eye may suggest sinus problems.  Pain in both eyes, particularly upon exposure to bright light, "photophobia," is common with many viral infections such as the flu and will go away as the infection improves. More severe photophobia, particularly when only one eye is involved, may indicate inflammation of the deeper layers of the eye and requires a doctor. And good luck.

But it helps your brain sort memories, do sort of maintanaince on your body, and once in a while, send random impulses from the rear brain to the thinking part in the front, which interprets these impulses frenetically, resulting in the phenomena of dreaming.  So most dreams really have no meaning at all.  But then again, nobody knows everything about the human mind--not even scientists.|`|76845aa2d3f727081f73b3db267a28b8aa	Body Maintenance: Sleep is essential for healthy cell growth and for cell and tissue repair.   Growth and Development: Children need much more sleep than adults to allow for the necessary growth and development changes in their bodies to occur properly. During sleep, growth hormones are released, and these hormones are crucial to proper physical and mental development. The effects (positive and negative) of sleep for babies and children are magnified depending on whether they get enough sleep or insufficient sleep. For example, tired children are often cranky, uncooperative, and difficult.   Immune System: Sleep enables the immune system to function effectively. Without proper sleep, the immune system can become weakened and, as a result, the body may become more vulnerable to infection and disease. During deep sleep, the body's cells increase production while proteins break down at a slower rate.   Memory, Learning and Social Processes: Sleep enables the brain to encode and store recently received information. REM sleep activates the parts of the brain that deal with learning. During sleep, various parts of the brain slow down, including the parts of the brain that control emotions, decision-making and social interactions. The resting of these parts of the brain during sleep allow optimal performance when awake. Without sufficient sleep, people are far less effective at learning new skills or retaining or recalling recently learned information.   Nervous System: Neurons regenerate and repair during sleep so that our bodies can continue to function as effectively as possible both physically and mentally. In people that experience sleep deprivation, neurons become unable to perform effectively and nervous system function is impaired. In people who have suffered extreme sleep deprivation, drastic and permanent brain and personality changes can occur.|`|wIN9xHuRaa	wow nice question never taught of dat|`|AdqfouDTaa	refills your energy and lets everything relax because we're constantly getting up and down during the day.    your body is always repairing things...like you might have a bruise or a scab...you could be fighting off a virus     so really it's letting some parts rest and others are still hard at work     And when i say rest i mean slow down a little|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	basically, when its get dark out, our body starts to produce more of a chemical called melatonin.

If so, you could have meningitis, get to the doctor.   Or: Was it abrupt in onset and the worst headache of your life? If so, again get to the doctor.     If not, continue:   It could be sinusitis if you have tenderness when you palpate your cheekbones or the ridge of your skull under your eyebrows.

You can alternate tylenol and ibuprofen (taking tylenol every 4-6 hours and ibuprofen every 4-6 hours so you're taking one or the other every 2-3 hours).     If this doesn't work and you can't sleep, I guess I'd go to the ER or an urgent care place. If they can get the pain broken, you can usually control it yourself with pain meds at home.

You won't get that from one side.  However the 50% of genes you got from your dad and the 50% you got from your mom mix handle that.   The short of it: it could go either way.  You'll just have to wait and see.|`|uOExJALGaa	It's a combo of both. DNA from both your mom and your dad combined to make you, hence, there's no real way to be sure with some things, although I know male hair loss is attributed to your mother's side of the family.
9ko5WUFkaa	Shaving won't cause your hair to grow back thicker or darker.  It's just an old wives tale.  All shaving does is cut the hair at skin level - it can't make any difference to how it grows.  Think about it, if it did, bald men everywhere would be shaving their heads to try to grow more hair.  The only thing with shaving is that the hair grows back quickly and because it's been cut the end of the hair feels coarse - if you let the hair grow the ends will naturally taper again and it won't feel prickly.  I'm pretty sure they tested this on Mythbusters and there is just no proof that it affects you hair growth in any way.      Waxing (if you can stand the pain) is a good option - it pulls the hair from the root so it takes longer to grow back.  Or if you can afford it you could try laser treatment - it's not cheap but after a few treatments it is permanent.  You could try hair removal creams - they only take off the hair to the skin, like shaving, but it feels softer as it regrows.    Hope this helps...|`|2KJvaWDYaa	its true it grows back darker and more stubbly. take it from a girl - we have to shave our underarms, legs and everywhere else. what happens is your natural hair is soft and but when you shave it after a while it grows back, rough, prickly and most likely darker (if you had fair hair to begin with).  all you have to do is run your hand over ur moms leg before she shaves and u will see its spikey and rough. this is cuz we girls shave and have been doing so our entire lives lol.  if u really want to get rid of ur stomach hair (y would u tho, ur a guy?) without getting these drawbacks then waxing is the only option. it pulls the entire hair out by the root, leaving no chopped off hair folicle to grow back spikey, but it hurts and is messy, but the hair will grow back slower and softer.    good luck!|`|QLZQtUH4aa	I think it does.  HOW???  HERE IT IS YOUR ANSWER!!!!    its like a tree right (the hair) at the tip is skinny and light, at the bottom its the trunk which is ticker so when you shave its like you cut it at the ground level and when it grows the trunk rises to the surface.|`|mDTkpuiuaa	i have no idea why it grows back thicker and darker but it's true.  try using nair, it's a cream that you put on then wash it off in the shower.  it keeps the hair gone in those places for about a week or so.|`|0b942db656cf91b93e0853fad2dd236eaa	It doesn't.

You have nothing to worry about.|`|1L6h4YXiaa	i think it actually does.|`|XKkbljFvaa	dude thats ******|`|qzK7sFRuaa	No, it does not. Just a myth.|`|CTIC7Pmjaa	No this is a myth that a lot of people believe.  I think it appears thicker as it reappears because when you cut it while shaving you cut off the tapered end, so the stubble that comes back is coarser, but when it returns to it's natural state, it's the same as it was.  Plucking or waxing will eventually discourage it from growing, though.|`|nm3f8HVRaa	Yes it will grow back that way. omg i can't believe i'm actually answering this question. hey i'm 15 too! but it will grow back that way because your body is trying to protect itself against the natural elements and make the hair more resistent to prevent it from being gotten rid of again.|`|N2O9rJvUaa	the only way for it to grow back the same thick is to cut it from the root  otherwise the remaining hair will get stronger than it was as a respond to shave( tht means it goes thicker n darker) so if u definitely dont want tht hair u could use wax or laser;)    good luck        Everybopdy in here has told ya it doesnt but IT DOES!  thts the reason for which if u clear a baby so many times hes/her hair will come into gray hair (ghair is thicker huh)|`|hCiy0CF4aa	For sure it will grow in thicker, but darker...not. If it came in darker then all of the old people would love you, and you would be a hell or a lot richer....lol.|`|1HeW6F6qaa	From my experiences, yes, it grows back rapidly and worse.   I've done the same thing; believe me, it only gets thicker.  I suggest you don't shave your stomach or thighs right away because that hair often gets lighter with age. The more you shave, the more that comes back.     Of course, this entirely depends on your hormones levels.   My overall suggestion is to avoid shaving areas you don't show off.|`|34tNnzQ7aa	No it does not, like others have said, it's a myth.    The reason why people say it does is because after they shave, they don't have any hair for a while and they get used to it. When it comes back, it SEEMS darker just because they aren't used to it seeing it/having any|`|bdc65f06d5f0eaa70856c37ce528082faa	No it has not been my experience that body hair will grow back thicker.

Just doesn't do that at all. Hair is dead tissue, all the growth takes place under the skin. Cutting off dead tissue doesn't do anything, and doesn't stimulate the hair follicle any more than, if not as much as just washing your face or body.  I think the stupid idea came from teens who shaved off hair, and wow- 2 weeks later there was more!  Of course there were-- more hairs developed, and would whether you shave or not.    Shave if you want, will just be a regular part of your routine if you keep doing that, about once a week or so.  And it won't be thicker. Though if you shaved today, you might have more in two weeks, but would anyway if more was going to come in.|`|TNapLRcuaa	no its does not, that is all just a myth|`|jKdVtDx7aa	Its a myth.|`|B3Cd58ehaa	No Im 15 and I do it once in a while it doesnt get thicker or darker|`|yZX1wpUJaa	No it;s a myth and it wont grow back thicker. You will notice that the hair keeps moving up or whateer way but thats from the hair starting to grow and not caused from shavong that area with no hair|`|qX0KdYUjaa	yea, if you keep shaving you will look like a gorilla monkey!|`|VY5dcdXVaa	well, the human body, through evolution, has always relied on hair to stay warm and because of this, it always grows back. The reason it comes back darker dates back to evolution millions of years ago... If a caveman lost his hair, it would mean he is freezing in his cave and needs to get warmer, thus, more hair.    So basically, yes, it would grow back darker and thicker.|`|5ocCUojWaa	dude don't shave it WILL grow back thicker|`|DIxbib1paa	Seriously, why would you wanna shave your hair. Your a male get used to it. Puff!|`|AA11522944	As far as i know it makes no difference to a hairs thickness or coarseness if you cut it.    It's a common myth because a guys beard starts out soft and light and gets thicker as he matures and shaves.  The reality is that even if he never shaved his beard would still get thicker and courser.

The book is based on the song I hope you dance by Lee Ann Womack.  I hope you dance I hope you never lose your sense of wonder. You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger. May you never take one single breath for granted. God forbid love ever leave you empty handed. I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean. Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens. Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance. And when you get the choice to sit out out or dance. I hope you dance. >>> I hope you dance.... I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance. Never settle for the path of least resistance. Livin might mean takin chances but they're worth takin. Lovin might be a mistake but it's worth makin. Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter.. When you come close to sellin out reconsider. Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance. And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. I hope you dance. I hope you dance. Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along. Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder where those years have gone. I hope you dance. I hope you dance. I hope you dance. What is hope? To want? To desire? To expect that what's envisioned may indeed happen? Yes to all of the above. Is hope that gut feeling that it's worth holding out and hanging on for just a little longer? Absolutely. Is hope the core of the human condition? Certainly. Can you have hope without faith and humility and wonder? That's tough. Just the thought that there's something bigger. something truer, something totally suprising out there waiting for us is. priceless. What would you be without hope growing deep in your bones, thriving in every inch of you? nothing. what does it take to hope? everything. From the book I hope you dance.     Some things I did to help my self in the past are:  call a friend and talk about something completely different   take a shower (make sure you don't have razors in the shower)   go for a walk or run, take a bike ride, dance like crazy, or get some other form of exercise   play with a pet   watch TV (change the channel if the show gets upsetting or features cutting)   drink a glass of water   try some relaxing yoga exercises  draw or scribble designs on paper using a red pen or paint on white paper  if it helps, make the paint drip   write out your hurt, anger, or pain using a pen and paper   draw the pain   compose songs or poetry to express what you're feeling   listen to music that talks about how you feel  squeeze, knead, or smoosh a stress ball, handful of clay, or Play-Doh  make a cup of tea, some warm milk, or cocoa   rub an ice cube on your skin instead of cutting it   wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it gently against your skin   draw on the skin with a soft-tipped red pen in the place you might usually cut     Call the suicide hotline... They offer free, confidential counseling on the phone...

Given that you've already got major depression, I think you should talk to a Psychologist about your problems.    The most tried and true method of improving anxieties in general is gradually increasing your exposure to the things that worry you, starting off with something easy.    A good first step might be to undertake a team sport or activity - one where you don't need to talk very much, but get some contact with others.    It doesn't matter if you don't have a boyfriend. For crying out loud, you're only 16! There is no need for people to start pairing up so young :P  As well, you're clearly able to talk online. This is also a good start as even socializing via typing is socializing. Way to go!    You need to learn that it doesn't matter what you say, and that even if you do say or do something 'embarrassing' that's ok too. Everyone does it.    Me? I embarrass myself/other people all the time. It's a GOOD thing. I put my foot in it, make comments that I only realize are inappropriate after I get blank stares, get told off occasionally by friends for saying something silly. So what? I have a wonderful social circle, a partner who adores me and treats me like a queen, and I talk to anyone and everyone even knowing I might mess up the conversations. I also work as a counsellor and know many people with social anxiety and social phobias. To tell the truth, everyone feels socially anxious sometimes. I sure do - I feel anxious if I'm in a group of people who I don't know if I have anything in common with, such as if they're all talking about a sport that I don't know anything about. And that's totally fine - I still hang out with them.     I would be very happy to chat with you some time, or exchange emails. It's hard to answer the question given that I don't know much about your circumstances.    Chin up though, you'll be able to make friends and socialize!|`|TUWK70vgaa	I hear you too.  You might consider volunteering at your church, get out and meet other people your age.

If he has depression then he may need help, I would not take it to heart as it is possible that it is nothing related to what you may have or have not done.

You can buy Aveeno oatmeal or they have a generic brand.  Just add a packet to your warm bathwater.  I use two packets.  Vaseline helps too.  I put it on my raw spots before I shower because otherwise the water burns so bad I can't stand it.  It helps clear it up faster than the other stuff.

5R3oVfisaa	first off I'm fifteen, I got it a year ago. my mom got it when she was sixteen so don't worry, everyone gets it at different times, and when you get it when you're older you'll have more time to grow which is a plus. I'm only 5"3" and will most likely only grow a few more inches =/ so if you get it during school, keep some pads or tampons in your bag, prob some pads during the first time would be better. oh and you'll definitely know, you'll have a big gooey gross wet stain in your underpants, tho for me the first time was brownish and lite, maybe itll be like that for you, but as you get it more its red, like pure red. it shouldn't show through your jeans unless youre wearing really light jeans and thats if its really heavy too, which it shouldn't be your first time. Well if you're afraid of everyone seeing, just have a sweatshirt in your bag, and tie it around your waist if you see you've had it. i know its a lot to handle but then maybe have an extra pair of pants in your locker if you're really worried it should happen, but it prob won't. so in closing peace.love..happiness... hope i helped....     |`|uly3aFqtaa	Wear panty-liners everyday, and put a little purse in your schoolbag with these things:    Spare pair of Underwear. [Full-briefs are more practical than a thong or skimpy-cut ones!]  Two liners.  Two pads.  Travel-Pack of Baby Wipes.  Travel-Pack of Tissues.  Two plastic Zip-Lock bags.    The pair of Underwear is for if you leak onto the Underwear you are wearing that day.  The Liners are for if you are getting Discharge, or forgot your Liner that day.  The Pads are for if your actual Period comes.  The Baby Wipes are for cleaning.  The Tissues are for if there is little or no toilet paper, and for wrapping your used pads up in if there is no Sanitary Bin.  The Zip-Lock bags are for putting your wrapped Pads in if there is no Bin, and your stained Underwear.    You should be 100% okay if you have that with you. There's no need to take it with you everytime you use the bathroom - if you feel anything come out, take the purse to the bathroom. If you are concerned about it looking really obvious, buy a little pencilcase instead of the purse.

Generally the first period is some blood spotting but nothing so much as to warrant going through clothes.  If it does, you'll deal with it when it happens, but try not to worry so much about it. Every day hundreds of girls start their periods at school... every one of them survives it.    There are usually other signs before it actually starts.  Cramping, sore breasts and some girls have a brownish discharge for a few days before it actually begins.

YES you can eat more when you workout or physically active becuase you burn calories. But to have a good body you can not eat what every you want. You have to eat healthy to have a good body.     You can do simple workout that will help you build muscle. Like push ups. 3 sets 20 reps/set, Crunches, sit ups. Running, stretching etc.   Or Get 2 dumbbells. It is amazing what you can do with  2 dumbbells.  Or you can hit the gym.

His body will naturally heal itself and the virus will run its course.  He needs plenty of liquids, like water, ginger ale, etc.  - no alcoholic beverages - and needs to get plenty of rest.  What does he like to eat?  Bring him what he wants and keep him comfortable and warm.  If he's not better in a week, or a cough lasts more than 2 weeks, he then may have to go to the doctor because the flu has turned into something else - like maybe bronchitis.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	The doctors can't do anything about the flu.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	Doctors can't do anything for a flu or common cold.

Ginger root is good for digestion--many people take it for stomach problems--but it also gets rid of colds/flu! Cilantro is good too. Don't know if your boyfriend would be willing to eat those things though as they're pretty strong-tasting. The next bes thing is lots of liquids, any kind, as your biggest issue is hydration.

AA11693263	I have Trigeminal Neuralgia, too. I am 36 years old and have had it for a long time. Your doctor should have given you more information about it. The nerve in your face is called the Trigeminal nerve. It has little "branches" all over your face. For some reason, yours (and mine) have become damaged and that is what causes the pain. I have done a lot of research on it and have found that there is a possible link between Aspartame (the sweetener used in diet soft drinks and foods) and Trigeminal Neuralgia. Aspartame is toxic to the nerves. So if you drink or eat anything with it in it, stop right away and see if it lessens your pain. It can take quite a while for it to leave your system so don't look for results in a day or two. To help relieve the pain, you can use a heating pad. The heat almost instantly relieves the pain at least enough so that you're not cringing in pain. For the other pain that you are having, yes you need to let your Neurologist know about it. I have a chronic full body Neurological (nerve) condition in addition to the Trigeminal Neuralgia (Neuralgia is just a fancy medical name for pain by the way). Your doctor needs to know about this because you could have more going on than just this. For now, google the Trigeminal Neuralgia and you will find a lot of information that will help you to understand more of what it is and why it happens. But like i said, it's really important to let him know about your other symptoms so he can give you a proper diagnosis. Also, if the heat isn't taking it away you need to let him know and see if there is any medication that he can prescribe you. There is medication specifically for nerve pain that works well. Don't just sit there in pain. One night, about 2 years ago, mine got so bad in both of my temples and under my eyes that my husband took me to the emergency room. They gave me pain medication injections and they worked very quickly. I was in so much pain that the needles (which usually hurt like heck because of the other nerve condition I have) didn't phase me at all. Good luck Sweetie. I hope your Neurologist figures out what is going on but remember, he can't unless you tell him everything :)|`|svR4WPZpaa	Read all you can on trigeminal neuralgia. You might have been misdiagnosed.

I hope this is useful for you.|`|5uEAHEQJaa	Trigeminal Neuralgia and Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia (facial pain)  Trigeminal neuralgia, caused by pressure on the trigeminal nerve, results in sudden, severe, painful, stabbing or electric-like shock in the face. The trigeminal nerve has three sections, which affect the forehead and eye region, the cheek, and the jaw, respectively. Pain can be triggered by laughing, chewing, brushing teeth, talking, wind, or facial touching. It can occur in one or all areas, usually begins on one side of the face, and in about 5 percent of patients affects both sides.      For more infomration google "Trigeminal Neuralgia"    This is one website that I used:     http://www.upmc.com/Services/minc/condit...    You can also google the medication and/or talk to pharmacist about the medication.    You are a very smart girl, read as much as you can about your condition and medication.    In the future tell the doctor to take tine to explain to you what is wrong and any options thatyou may have for remedy and medicating, before you leave his office.
mtmMQH4Xaa	wild guess here, but here goes.    At that age when a guy goes pee the flow can be strong but the flow rate is controlled.    At any age a BJ feels great, When he cums, there is no control over the force of the ejaculation or the amount that may spew forth so the passage way can take one hell of a beating for that brief moment.  For a short time that inner lining is going to be tender so when he goes pee it's going to sting because of the tenderness.

Do you have time in your day to watch an hour or more of TV, or spend an hour or more on some computer (besides work). If so then use that time to excercise. Also you don;t have to go to the gy, a few jogs around your neighborhood are good, then come home and do some pushups and crunches. Also eat healthier, then you'll lose weight|`|1nIeHzofaa	You can't lose weight fast and expect to keep it off.  You must change your eating habits for good.  Go low fat and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, protein (soy and fish are best) and olive oil.  Give up (for good) fried foods, fast food, and anything high in saturated fat like butter and mayo. Do this every day and you won't have to worry about losing weight "fast'

qu7DSLTqaa	This sounds serious. You should see your Dr. Have you seen a nutritionist to help you avoid the foods you are allergic to while eating a healthy diet?  Are you eating enough? Low blood sugar can make you dizzy (and I've passed out from it before). Eating things high in sugar will make it worse. Drink plenty of water. I really think a Dr. would be the best bet. They can check you over and find out what's going on. My daughter actually had a Dr. note to eat during school (healthy, high protein/carb snacks).  Please see your Dr.!|`|es3feuhxaa	i've never had a fainting problem but your best bet is to stay hydrated and take deep breaths|`|378GRzrnaa	are you eating enough? this is serious so go to a doctor asap!!     good luck i hope u get better|`|0KXxsTsyaa	Do you think it's anxiety???

lbR1IoiSaa	The one food that is relatively easy to snack on and eat with / even for a meal, that contains a good amount of fiber (which is good for your bowels, but also to keep your system generally healthy), AND protein (which is good to build muscle and burn fat) - is baked beans.    The recommended daily intake for fiber is 20-30 grams.  I believe (i don't have a can handy to verify) that a small single-serving can of baked beans has about 8 grams of fiber per serving (perfect snack for lunch). Good ol' Franco American Spaghetti & Meatballs is i think 5 grams per serving.    Other good sources of fiber are certain cereals like Grape Nuts (7 grams), and Raisin Bran (7 grams).  Certain vegetables and fruits are good sources of fiber as well.     Keep in mind that many high fiber foods do not contain much fat, and despite what we'd prefer, our bodies need fat to function.  So just make sure you get what your body needs, especially fiber wise, and you should be feeling better soon.  Oh, one more thing, many people with bowel issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have sensitive stomachs to beef, so you may want to try easing up on your consumption of beef products (or at least buy much more lean if you cook it (even if it costs you more - it's better on your belly :) ).  Monitor your dietary intake to see if it helps!

Bran cereal is high in fiber with about 19 grams of fiber per cup.     Avacados have almost 12 grams of fiber in them.     Lima beans and black beans are also high in fiber from about 14 to 16 grams of fiber per cup.     Doctors suggest 30 - 50 grams of fiber per day. Try to get at least 30 grams and if you don't see a change then try for 40 and so on.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	A women should get 20-25 grams of fiber a day.  fruits and veggies are the best and make sure you are drinking enough...8 glasses of water a day.

Q2bGrCeKaa	You should go by the smell...each time you put on and take off your clothes make a habit of smelling it.....In doing so you will know when your body is changing in a negative or positive way......    If the discharge has a fowl smell it could be yeast or it could be caused by other bacterias....if it has no smell then it is ok....your vagina provides a cleaning for itself and that is why you are told not to push anything inside it to clean it out. So the discharge might just be that of your vagina cleaning itself....Also yeast infections,,,,,,,the discharge is normally cream to yellow color.....As long as it does not have a terrible smell i would not worry.
6egxGam6aa	I don't know if it's "bad" to be addicted to it, but it's probably not that great either.

You definitely want to watch that you don't use more than one or two at a time; skin is very porous and the ingredients in Icy Hot can seep into your skin.     And yes, you can die Melyn. It's not dangerous at low levels, but like you read about, it can kill a person if used in excess.

deYDbVDSaa	It is airborne. You can also get it from pee, crap or an infected person's skin. Humans are the only animal that carry it.    No one knows how the first person got it. In 1881, is was recognized as a separate disease. People were getting long before then though. The major outbreak was between 1962 and 1965. The vaccine was discovered shortly thereafter. The vaccine was OK'd in 1969.

Vj13f7zmaa	It has nothing to do with depth at all.. the hymen (cherry) is on the OUTSIDE at the opening of the vagina.. not deep inside.

Like you sort of feel like you want to press on it? I know weird. But it really is fine, that will go away in time, just as every thing else in this wierd time period. Its ok to keep it to your self. Relax, have fun, and maybe you'll forget about it. As for in school, maybe put a book on your lap, just to keep some weight on it, I know, touchy subject. You'll be okay, we've all felt it.|`|uzWqpG0Maa	My dear, every teen out there is "throbbing". Why do you think middle school is such a tension filled place. It is normal as your body grows into adulthood before the rest of you. It is tough. Hang in there. You will find things to do until you can be married. It is nature's way. May I suggest you take Yoga. It may relieve some of your stress.  Outrider|`|Mkroj9gPaa	its normal.|`|3MnRZX0Maa	ewwwwwwwwwww|`|LX42iJyCaa	totally normal....it's your hormones...when you enter the adolescent stage this happens..especially when you see really cute boys..2 or 3 days later you'll want to know what you saw in him.|`|e7b9d32e1fb4efafbebd927303f7c128aa	It's absolutely normal. Most girls by your age are experiencing sexual desires even though they may not know what to do with them.    I suggest that you go to the library and pick up a book called "women our bodies, ourselves" turn to the chapter on sexuality and masturbation.    Masturbation exploration right now should be your goal, especially if you are feeling painful desires. Use your hands to explore your body and discover how to release your tensions on your own.    Best of luck in this new chapter of life,|`|nm3f8HVRaa	Haha it's totally fine trust me, been there, know that. Totally normal, don't worry about it.|`|QhoKp5NXaa	it's normal..ur hormones r crazyy it's not ur fault mom!  hold on to that vcard!|`|YbbmVesLaa	yes it is normal that feeling is well how do i put it   like when a guy gets a erection only with a girl it does not show   there are ways to getting rid of it(masturbate cough cough) or ohter han that when u get the feeling it goes away afater a while dot worry  it is natural|`|1HeW6F6qaa	Completely normal. Sexual urges come soon after your period. This is only because puberty is making your hormones rage.    The 'throbbing' are known as 'vaginal spasms'. Don't worry about them; they're the female equivalent of an erection. They are caused by arousment and/or your sexual organs starting to work.     It is probably best not to act too much on these feelings because impulsive behavior doesn't end up well more often than not.
ATaePt5Xaa	yes, depending on how full your bladder/bowel is.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	No.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Well if your bladder is full your stomach tends to be larger because of the excess fluid. Same goes when you have to poop. I don't think the actual size of your waist gets smaller because that tends to be measured higher up than your lower abdomen.|`|6u57CHDFaa	I don't measure it, so I don't really know. I suspect not though.|`|claW4UUcaa	no but i hear comedians like larry the cable guy joke about taking a crap so big your pants feel better. maybe it is possible idk.|`|1HeW6F6qaa	That'd have to be a really long bathroom break.

xKYXurpNaa	Ab Exercises do not burn fat|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	You should work out every other day with weights, 3 days a week . ( example :  monday  , wednesday, friday ) Every day do  ab exercises ,except sunday. Run a mile on your off work out days tues thurs sat.  Maybe  one of those days add in some sprinting exercises that will burn more calories and fat.  Eat nutritional meals and snacks .  Fruit preferably for a snack with  occasional ice cream dish as a treat for  doing good work.    I just  gave you my opinion of a work out should be    take it  or  leave it.    Good luck!!|`|bC42lYYtaa	1-2 months.  ab workouts don't get you abs though.  everyone already has a six pack.  you just can't see it because it is covered with fat.  which is why you need to eat healthy and do cardio exercises, instead of reps and throwdowns (keep the crunches).|`|MyEw2caIaa	i wish i had that energy

u8CFwtyMaa	It's one of the changes that happen in puberty, and you are doing very well down there.  w  Welcome to manhood, buddy.  hope this helps|`|AA11785060	Normal.  The penis and balls start growing rapidly at the onset of puberty, so that you quickly become a sexually functional male capable of reproduction well before you are fully grown.  Part of the "survival of the species" thing--- 150 years ago life expectancy was only around 45 or so, and kids got married sometimes at 14 or 15-- and could and did have babies within a year or so.   So your penis and balls develop right away so you can reproduce (of course don't do that) as soon as possible. Makes for some fun times as a teen. Enjoy it.|`|LQ04emc3aa	honey, it's testosterone.  very normal, it's like a growth spurt.  so don't worry about it,   and, isnt that a good thing?|`|a71t2nW9aa	That's just puberty hitting u|`|5M66uXxIaa	Wow, your "member" is growing unusually fast.  I think it's going to slow down soon, but that's fairly big.  It's not an unusual size, but the rate it was growing at was fast.  Your voice will drop soon enough, and the same for your armpit hair.  Oh right, the first question!  Uh, it's just growing fast because you started puberty.  Typically, the penis will start to grow first in the long road to adulthood.  Have fun...?    -Drews|`|Y2CkerIhaa	I'll Tap That ;p  Haha  JUST KIDDING!

AA11850523	Usually not  its not a work related injury|`|mAp90hEeaa	You are seeking help from the wrong program.  As the other answerer has listed, workman's comp is for injuries that occur while on the job.  Most degenerative disc problems come from long-term abuse of your back.  The injections might help - some people get some relief by this method, others get short term relief and then the problem comes right back and others get no relief.  If you are looking for some sort of disability, you might check into SSI.
Xo0gWfBAaa	Your not clear if this is a new job or not,but if you didnt hurt yourself at work you could get in trouble if W.C. finds out.

g7ffUmTbaa	I don't know why, but I do know it happens.  It happens to me and so I will avoid going to the bathroom as long as possible.  I happened to my mother, and there was a girl on here a while back who it happens too as well.      I have no idea why, but what I do to make it hurt less is like an hour before I go I take midol.  Perhaps not the best idea (especially for your kidneys), but it's what I do.

K4zsztkRaa	I was circumcised at birth, however I am restoring my foreskin. I can state that it is a fact that circumcision causes a significant decrease in sensitivity. It's impossible not to.    What happens is your are removing nerve endings from the penis, obviously that's a loss. But the big loser is your head is now exsposed, dry and rubbing against your clothing. This causes the head to develope a calous over the head, or causes the head to keratinize. This makes the head seem bigger but it also makes it less sensitive. There is a layer of cells that build up over time from all the chaffing of your head against your clothes. It gets thicker and thicker over time.  This causes a lack in sensitivity as well as a decrease in the intesity of orgasms, and a decrease in the length of orgasms.    My head is now covered and not exsposed to my pants, my head has gotten a lot more sensitive, my orgasms are more intense and last longer. If circumcision didn't reduce sensitivity then I never would have seen an increase in pleasure. That wouldn't have happened if circumcision didn't reduce feeling.    Some guys who were circumcised later in life don't notice the difference because the change is so subtle. When their head is newly exsposed it feels itchy and bothersome against clothing right away, and then over time it's not itch bothersome anymore becasue the sensitivity is slowly going away. Well the Keratinization process is so subtle at first the loss of sensation isn't noticed sometimes. But I bet you anything that if you covered those guys (the ones circumcised as adults) head for a few weeks they would see the difference. And see the big change that was very subtle.    -Connor|`|CNW6eAjoaa	Well, my vote is definitely in the 'against' camp.  I am currently involved in foreskin restoration.  On other sites, I meet and talk with lots of men who have been cut as adults.  They report the lose of between 50-80% sensitivity.  If they did not regret it, so many of them would not be on the restoration chat sites, getting the moral support needed to restore their foreskins.  The foreskin has a purpose and reason.  It was never meant to be cut off, especially without the consent of the owner.  If you are interested in more information on foreskin restoration, go to www.norm.org and also the link posted.  If you have other questions please feel free to write me.|`|QBUypAmAaa	I'm against it, and I wasn't done as an adult, but at birth.  Sensitivity is greatly reduced in a circumcised male.  I may be pretty biased for intactness, I'll admit that, but if you want me to show proof as to why intact is better for sex, click the link I've provided that is all. Go through 1 all the way to 10.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	I'm going to say better simply because for me it is.    Up until I was 20 I had no problems and never thought much of it, but then I met a girl I fell totally in love with. she moved in with me after a few weeks of knowing her because for some reason we both felt we had known each other forever. With that chemistry came sex, and lots of it.  After a few months, having sex was getting painful for me, what was happening was the foreskin was being pulled back and was starting to tear, I put up with it for about 1 year then got the nerve up to ask my doctor  about it. He kind of chuckled and told me I should get circumcised, so I did.    As far as the sex goes, It still felt great and and I was at last pain free. A big plus is not having to worry so much about any possible odour. Way cleaner.    My wife missed it for awhile, as back then we where still young and she was just fascinated with that foreskin and loved to play with it, she said it was her toy, and I was always taught to share my toys.     To get this done just for the sake of doing it, I'm not sure if that's right or not.|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	I was circ'd as an adult and it was the best thing i ever did for myself. Not only did I grow up ashamed of being in the extreme minority,  I had a very lousy sex life due to the fact that i was way too sensitive. Yes I probably did lose 50 percent of the sensitivity. That was about where i needed to be. I woul;d a lot rather been done as a newborn because it was a rough recovery, but I would still do it again in a heartbeat. I am sorry for those who are unhappy with having been done at birth, but hey, get over it. There are more important things to stew about in life. If that is the only thing these whiny babies have to complain about in their lives then I'd say they are in pretty good shape. But thats my opinion!|`|rFUqIakAaa	Here's what you have to consider when asking a question like this. Why did the person choose to get circumcised to begin with? Most guys (who are uncircumcised) never choose to get circumcised. 3 out of every 1,000 decide that they want to be circumcised for whatever reason. Usually, the few that do get circumcised choose that because they have some kind of issue with their foreskin to begin with (can't retract it, can't clean under it, too sensitive, etc). So for these guys, they are usually going to say it's better after being circumcised (because for them it is). But for the average guy, if nothing is wrong with your foreskin, then it's probably a bad idea to get rid of it. Circumcision does reduces sensitivity and sexual pleasure for men with a normal foreskin, and once it's gone there is no way to get it back so why risk changing something that works just fine to begin with?    http://www.livescience.com/health/070615...  http://www.jackinworld.com/qow/q15.html|`|C6tKpoN6aa	I was circumcised at 23, nearly 28 now. i prefer to be circumcised. has improved sex for me as well as the g/f according to her, is obviously cleaner, especially if doing alot of sport or camping where water is limited (which is the case where i go camping)  and, well, for the vast mojority it is either prefered to be circumcised or 'no preference' for the opposite sex.   only draw back is being out of commission sex wise completely for 4 - 8 weeks (adult bodies take alot longer to heal than babies)  it is not as painful as alot seem to try to make out online. uncomfortable at times during healing yes but i wouldn't say painful.
74ZWM1Sfaa	Calorieking.com is the best website for figuring your calorie intake I use it all the time!    According to it you consumed about 1161 calorie if your trying to lose weight you should consume about 1,500 but for a regular diet this is great plus since your most of your calories are from veggies you will burn them a lot easier then processed foods.|`|lw8n5BFeaa	Thats GREAT! except you need to eat more whole grains, and meats, fishes.. proteins,girl, you can't live on fruits and veggies..well you can, but yeah. you could accually be eating more O_o|`|3p3otDlXaa	I don't know how many calories, yet you could eat some more.

XzEGvaXjaa	Don't be embarrassed or scared, its natural and you didn't do anything wrong. You probably just came on your period...I would say congrats but its not all that great. You need to tell your mother as she will be the one who will best guide you through this. I'm sure she'll be thrilled for you.    When I first came on my period, my aunts were the first to know cause it happened at their house. They attacked me with hugs and kisses telling me I was a woman now. It was confusing, but supportive. When I got home I told my mother and she pretty much did the same. When my cramps started getting really bad, my mother was there taking care of me, giving me hot bottles, stuffing pillows against my stomach, drawing baths for me, packing me inside of layers of covers, etc. lol. My mother was the one who helped me research the raspberry leaf tea which helped my cramps calm down. And even now that I'm 20 years old, my mother is the first I call when I need someone to come take care of me while I'm on my period (my boyfriend is second).    So don't be afraid to tell your mother. She'll probably be the most supportive person for you as you begin your "transition into womanhood". And if you have a problem in your relationship with your mother, tell another trusted adult who can function similarly for you.    Good luck sweetie. Remember, this is completely natural and nothing to be ashamed or frightened of.|`|KsgdRHfNaa	ok sweetie, this happens to every girl on the planet, and your are gunna hafta tell your mom eventually. so here is my suggestion:  write her a not and leave it on the table. explain to her that you think you got your period, but your not ready to talk yet. tell her to leave supplies for you in the bathroom, and you can talk when your ready. when i firast got my period, i didnt want to tell my mom, and i didnt know how. i saw tired and was sleeping the whole day and she just asked me sweetie, do you think you got your period and i said yes and she gave me supplies...good luck...-D|`|XARb9jbbaa	1.) Tell your parents or a trusted adult.  2.) Put a pad or tampon in. Whichever one your parents want you to wear.  3.) Pack tampons or pads in your backpack.  4.) Get a purse!

And also keep some in your bookbag, purse or school locker.
Kbu1Ae7Maa	im a little confused... you're ashamed of it, but you're asking us how to continue? you're either trying to stop, or go. im gonna hope youre trying to stop and speak as though you do    you said your teachers were more supportive right? so then talk to them instead!!!  eating disorders can be really serious and you'll want to stop it as soon as possible. i know that in some cases, a factor could be psychological, but try to stop living by hiding things and remind yourself that this is something that youre ashamed of. if you have to, have something tangible that youll see a lot to stop yourself, like a ring or bracelet. you can eat a bunch of small meals instead of a couple big ones so that you wont throw up each time, but wont feel hungry. also, you wouldnt want people to know would you? well if there is no problem, then theyll see no problem    i hope you have fun at the camp ^-^|`|AA11739944	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! I love how your "bulimic help help please" question is about how to be bulimic and not how NOT to be bulimic. You'd think someone would want to stop being messed up.    Here's a tip  STOP DOING IT!!!!!!!!!!!  If you are so ashamed of it then just eat your food like a ******* normal person! Eat your food without throwing it up. You must have some kind of mental problem.

This made my teeth pretty yellow, and they were pretty yellow for the next 5 or so years.    I tried baking soda formulas and numerous differnt so called whitening toothpastes and nothing really worked in the long term. Then I tried a product online called 'teeth whiten tips' which I got for around 40 dollars.    It was really easy to use and involved just rubbing gel onto my teeth with special cotton swabs provided with it, I used this for around  amonth and noticed by the second week my teeth we're already 4 or 5 shades lighter and now I'm not ashamed of my smile anymore.

df56317200b43fc902cf6236360f3a4daa	The disorders ADHD, ADD, OCD, and Tourette's all have some basis in the caudate nucleus and the basal ganglia region in the brain (which is where the caudate nucleus and amygdala are located). The caudate nucleus deals with the shifting and focus of attention and the amygdala is the fear center (and other negative emotions) center of the brain. Although there is known to be some relationship in these disorders to these centers of the brain, I have a hypothesis that takes it forward from there. I have Tourette's, ADHD, and OCD, and can see where they overlap. ADHD displays by a difficulty paying attention to what I should be paying attention to. Instead, I may daydream or become interested in a piece of what someone is saying for example, and then find it very difficult to pay attention to the conversation. When I was a young child, I found it almost impossible to ever maintain conversation with anyone for more than a minute or two without totally zoning out. I think that when this attention is focused on worries, it is more OCD-like. Although obsessions are a focus of attention, and those with ADHD are supposed to have difficulty paying attention, I have read some data that those with ADHD and ADD both have a hard time paying attention to what they need to, but also can focus intensely on something they are interested in (like when they are imagining while daydreaming. Possible further parallels need to be researched more thoroughly. As for the Tourette's, ... well the best way to describe parallels between OCD and Tourette's is by example: when checking my alarm clock to see if it is set, I feel a need to check many times that the alarm button is set by pulling it all the way off and all the way on. The checking is OCD, however the Tourette's requires a need to feel a strong enough tension while I am doing it. If it doesn't feel right, I have to do it again until it does. However, if the number of times checked is an even number, the OCD wants me to add to it to make it an add or "nice" feeling number. The relief of the fingertips (Tourette's) is the same as I get from a need to have a particular body-sense of tension in the neck by shaking the head. Likewise for yelling out a particular articulation with my voice, such as the "g" or "b" sound, as well as the need to say a particular obscene word correctly (I have the rare and severe form of Tourette's that causes coprolalia, or cussing.) What I have found through many years of careful observation is that the tics of Tourette's and the compulsions of OCD share something vital to understanding both in common. Whether it's one or the other, it starts with a focusing of attention on doing the tic or the compulsion. Although sometimes this focus of attention for a tic might be less obvious, it is definitely there: example: "my face feels tight, my face feels tight, my face feels tight (repeating)" leads to moving of all my facial muscles in a kind of grimace-like expression. This does not occur if a big enough stimulus interrupts my focus on my face. In the same way, checking to see if I my faucet is indeed "fully" off (OCD)--this obsession, and thus the compulsion to check, can be interrupted if something distracts me. It is also about focus. Thus focus of attention plays a role in these three disorders. The caudate nucleus plays a role kind of like a gear shifter in a car. In "normal" people, it is smoother than those with Tourette's, OCD, or ADHD/ADD. (I use quotes for normal because these disorders seem to increase chances of success for some people in certain circumstances, which is probably a reason for their relatively high prevalence in the population compared to some other more rare diseases. Otherwise they might have been bred out through natural selection by now.) Future research needs to examine these interrelationships between these disorders more closely at the anatomical and biochemical/cellular levels. As for bipolar disorder, which is related to depression (which commonly occurs with OCD), I think the amygdala's over-reactive sending of fear signals makes the caudate nucleus function even less well (in the respect that the attention is focused on unhealthy obsessions). I also read some research that supported this idea that the amygdala worked in tandem with the caudate nuceus. (This can also lead to a vicious cycle of exaggerated fear response leading to increased focus on the fear, which in turn leads to more fear, etc., etc.) Depressed people--I mean really depressed people, cannot seem to get the sad feeling out of the minds, much like an anxiety-fueled obsession of OCD. Depression is then a sadness-fueled obsession, which can in large part be also motivated by fear. However, I think that Major depression, bipolar disorder, and OCD are quite distinct disorders. I read some interesting research lately (cannot remember where) that showed that Tourette's sufferers actually have not only abnormally shaped basal ganglia, but at the microscopic|`|AA10029187	Start your research here:    http://www.tourettesyndrome.net/    and then here    http://www.tsa-usa.org

ZqCWi4XLaa	Tomorrow i want you to count all the calories that you consume and then make a goal to cut 250 calories from your total every two weeks. Along with this you should jog every morning  before breakfast for 20 minutes (best time of day to burn fat). For diet, eat 5-6 meals that consist of healthy foods along with ice water to speed up metabolism. Going to the gym also helps to burn fat so i suggest you keep this up also. 5-6 meals can be pretty over whelming at times and you can do this by drinking protein shakes as one of your meals. If you do this you can lose 15 pounds in 40 days if you really commit to it. It will be worth it when u finally achieve your goal.

This will eventually decrease the swelling and redness and help shrink the inflammation and pain that sometimes comes along with it.|`|w8xJGEJCaa	wash your face with an anti-acne soap....if this doesn't work...just wash your face with water, and maybe put a little lotion on it..but not too much because lotion can actually be the cause of acne..if none of this helps you can get special cream to put just over your pimple from the dermatologist's office. i got some and i just put it on overnight.and it's practically gone by morning! honestly! it works well! it's in this little white tub type thing..there is also this cream that comes in a tube for acne....i believe it's called differin i like that one even better..works very well!|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	A pimple starts about 10 days before it actually shows up on your face.   So the best advice is to have a regime in place.  An acne wash  toner  spot treatment   Twice a day every day without missing a step.    If you need it gone asap use alcohol after you wash it with acne wash, then dab acne cream on it.    There are several brands but your face will tell you what works.    What doesn't toothpaste it may for one person in 100 but it's for teeth not your skin!|`|HFV6Ohqmaa	pop it then use face wash i use the new neutrogena stuff and my face cleared up fast|`|aLgLVOTFaa	put tooth past on it and then after that put cold water on it works =)|`|ztR13XyJaa	You need to get proactive refining mask. It works the best on drying out pimples. If you don't have that then prolly just pop it and wait til it heals|`|E7pc9Ko6aa	use exfoliates. Mash two strawberries and paste it onto your face. lie down for 5 minutes. wash it off. do this every day for two weeks. it worked for me! but when the pimple is at its bursting peak, pop it by getting 2 q tips. squeeze them together at the pimple. let the pus flow out until blood shows.
AA10127677	I actually started my diet journal 1/2/09 and so far I've lost 17 lbs. I honestly think it has a lot to do with tracking what you eat. You have to cut out sodas all together. You can have like crystal lite, but the best thing to do is just stick to water only for a while. Make sure you are drinking at least 4 bottles a day. It sounds like your eating pretty healthy, but also make sure when you get subway to not have too much mayo, maybe replace it with mustard, and only whole wheat bread no white. And last of all make sure that you eat every 3 hours or so, never let your stomach growl!  I'm proud of you for doing your best to slim down. Keep at it!!! :)|`|0gtlHP6Uaa	Yeah thats a good way to diet. Exept the subway part. Subway isnt really a diet it still has lots of calories. Try eating salads and some healthy stuff. Also it depends if you should go on a diet by depends I mean how tall you are. Remember always drink water !|`|SEbchthIaa	Okay the best possible thing in the world to do is become vegitarian for weight loss, i am a vegitarian and it is 110% more healthy if you do it the right way.  I never thought I could do it because i loved meet but its possible.    Take multi vitamins and drink protein shakes if your a vegitarian.    and if you dont wanna go that way then...  STOP SUBWAY, unless its turkey without any condiments and weat bread.  which is pretty gross.    Also slim fasts dont really work either.    Exersize is the key!    and dont listen to the dude above me he is an asshole.
K3ZC6cvCaa	he did, for his movie 'chapter 27'  but he's lost the weight again nowadays. he's as hot as ever!|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Osmond? As in Marie Osmond's brother? I don't ever recall him as being "fat", but then the only thing I've really seen him in is "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat".       The person who has been accused of shooting President John F. Kennedy (conspiracy theories aside) is Lee Harvey Oswald. (Isn't basic history taught anymore? Geesh.)     So what if a stick thin Hollywood person gained a few pounds. Apparently one is only "pretty" if s/he is skinny. I laughed when I read the story on Jessica Simpson's weight gain. Now she actually looks as though she eats real food several times a day. Now she actually looks pretty.    I digress.|`|uyev6n53aa	yeah that true...|`|0iJSa2c1aa	Have you seen him lately?!? It's definitely true. Eek.    http://justjared.buzznet.com/images/2006...|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Yes, but he lost it already.  It was for a role he played in a movie (can't think of the name), where he was the man that shot Kennedy.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	He was playing Osmond and he did gain a lot of weight, but he's on his way back down.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	I heard he was doing a movie, could be for that..|`|gErVlMNuaa	Yes it was for a movie but he already lost all the weight. Go to perezhilton.com and you will see recent pictures of him.
ETcBRko3aa	Psychiatrists mainly prescribe medication.   They usually do not do therapy with clients.    Psychologists usually have a PhD and more schooling than a "counselor."  They can not prescribe medication but they usually do intensive, long-term therapy.|`|TUWK70vgaa	If you want to be helped either one can help you.  The main difference is a psychologist cannot prescribe medication.  Also, a psychiatrists hourly fee is steeper.  Given your explaination seek the help of a psychiatrist.  In the long run it may be the least expensive route.
BNHeJm8Maa	I know how you feel, I'm putting it down to either PMT/PMS or Seasonal Affective Disorder in my case. Maybe best to see if theres anything going on in your life thats causing this i.e. relationship/family/work/school problems?|`|sKGeirdaaa	its normal to get mood swings when your on your period. but if your experiencing them while your off your period then go to your doctor and talk about bi polar disorder
AA11565057	You should tell us what height you are and how much you weigh.     People with bulemia have very distorted views regarding their own appearance. If your friends don't want to 'help' you by encouraging you to restrict your diet, binge and purge, overexercise of similar, I think they're being good friends.    Chances are, you are fine in terms of weight.     Just so you know, dieting actually tends to do more harm than good to people as it encourages very distorted beliefs about food, eating and body image.     It may be a good idea to go to your doctor and ask him whether you need to lose any weight - and if so, get his assistance. Regardless of your weight though, who cares? What does it matter if you're overweight, or normal, or underweight? The only important thing is whether you are healthy... And if you have bulemia, chances are that you are not.
14a34c9cc2a0eb5390d7b1d4c8c82378aa	Most of the time an immediate denture can be put right in. Immediates are fitted by impressions made prior to the removal of your teeth, some in the back may be removed and then the denture is made and available the day the rest are pulled, the immediate is put in and you go home with teeth.    Immediate dentures take more work to make comfortable and keep fitting well until healing is complete but to me it was so worth it to get them. No embarrassment of being without teeth, getting to learn to wear dentures right away, helps with healing and control of swelling. There are many advantages.    Some dental practices recommend leaving the gums barren for a period of time and then fit the dentures once the majority of the swelling has gone done.    Feel free to contact me off the board if you wish.    Sandy|`|0lG71HNIaa	i am sure they will give you a temp for the upper as well. they know that you will not want to leave there with no teeth.
p3AbTmbfaa	She never had or cant have orgasms so her vagina muscles deteriorate and stretch out to become lose. Soon you will be able to put your head if she doesnt fix that problem. Having a baby is no excuse to easily be able to take a the entire fist of a grown mans hand|`|1YaHn28Yaa	I'm sure she naturally has a wide vagina but if your really close to her i'd suggest telling her politelty (and in privacy of course)  to go and see her GP just to check if everything is ok. If she trusts you enough she might ask you to go with her.     It also depends how long ago she had the baby her vagina may still be decresing and the muscle still might be gaining it's strength.     Best of luck sorting this out!   Keep me posted   xox Della|`|LKqbrHNnaa	Women don't normally lose the tightness of their vagina until they give birth to a baby and have the muscles weakened - lots of sex doesn't really make much difference no matter how much people say, as the vaginal canal muscles are made to be really stretchy and a penis isn't a challenge.  Your girlfriend sounds like she just has a naturally different vagina than the others you have slept with, which is totally normal.  She could have a longer vaginal canal that you can't reach the back of, or she could be having sex in a position where the canal is stretched.    You can try pushing her legs back towards her ears (if she is comfortable with it, it takes some bravery), which shortens the vaginal canal.   Don't bring it up with he though, it will most likely shatter her confidence. Just like men want to have a big penis, we like to think we have tight vaginas.|`|ahDUOe48aa	its called a big hole. some women just arent tight. Kids or not|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	well if she had a large baby, and then never did kegels exercises to tighten things up down there, she is going to be loose as a goose and there isn't much you can do about it.  if you don't do kegels religiously after childbirth, you just stay all stretched out of shape.  Has nothing to do with sexual partners, it has everything to do with her having had a child and following up with the kegels.|`|4VFEkqJiaa	The Vagina is the birth canal and will expand in order to deliver a baby!    All vagina's are made like this unless there is a medical problem.  Your girlfriend is obviously at ease with you and so relaxed that you are able to place your hand inside her.    Also, if she is aroused then her vagina will secrete fluid making her 'wet' which will also allow easy penetration.    Your girlfriend has a normal vagina and you are lucky to have found a partner that can completely relax with you.    The problem is not with her, but that perhaps your previous partners were not fully relaxed with you, therefore not allowing the same penetration.|`|5GL2eFhyaa	She has had a child, simple    A whole baby coming out of there is going to do things you know!|`|2c9238ee724e9355edb9828e79f799d2aa	but does it echo when you speak into it?|`|k57Kvgn8aa	i unno|`|XGHLrOklaa	The vagina even after child birth goes back to it's original size.  Trust me I've had two kids I know.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Just eat when you need to...your stomach can feel upset when you are hungry...|`|iQ70p3nJaa	You should eat if you're hungry.    And my stomach feels acidic and nauseous when I'm scared.
72iZuDjeaa	nope,,, i suggest you stop shouting though,,, that might help...|`|48Yf8tpsaa	Get your blood pressure tested along with your blood sugar and cholesterol.
fMfBAgOUaa	You arent supposed to use the face mask a lot. It will dry out your skin like crazy. If I have a bad pimple, I put a bit of the mask on it and leave it on for about an hour before I go to bed. Usually by the morning it is smaller, and the next day it is gone. The more you mess with it, the longer it will take to heal and go away.|`|PGkbPBZmaa	You are using that facemask way too much, 3 times a day?? You are just drying out your face and making it a whole lot worse. Use it a couple times a week, 3 at the most. Put some antibiotic ointment on your pimple.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I hope this needle you used was sterile. Did you burn it or use alcohol before you used it so it doesn't get affected. Most likely it will turn into a scar, even pimples that you may not mess with it turns into a scar. Since it is new you can make sure it doesn't scar you have many options to use. You can use the most expensive to the cheapest. It goes, Mederma scar removal that you can buy anywhere, Neutrogena Acne Scar Fading peel, but it works on post-acne only. These run for about 20 dollars or less. You can use lemon juice, place on the scar, and wash off in 15 minutes. Use apple cider vinegar follow the same directions as the lemon juice. Or you can make a baking soda and water paste and leave on for 10 minutes. All three are acidic and cause irritation to sensitive skin. So be careful. You damaged it so it will turn into a scar. Also drinking 8 to 10 glasses of water daily can help. This is because you are flushing the toxins and oil out of your water because they are going out in your urine and when we don't drink this much the toxins and oils exit out of our skin, so some exit out of our face, making acne.    Good Luck  P.S. I use the baking soda mix on my face and I am starting to see results on my newest acne scars, the oldest acne scars and chicken pox scars still take time so I am waiting to see results.
Fyo6HC56aa	When your wake up, post-exercise, and before going to bed.|`|XQ0xL8inaa	I have bad acne too. My doctor said to wash my face two times a day. It can be any time difference. I wash my face every morning and night.  Here are some washes you can use that work:  -Clean and Clear  -Cetaphil  -Purpose

6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	The decision to shave or not is a decision that only you can make.  Since it is your body.  The hair will grow a little bigger over time.  But it wont be noticeable through your jeans or nothing like that.  I have found that shaving decreases your chances of sweating down there.  Because having a lot of hair makes you sweat and smell.  You do not have to shave all of it just trim it down.  If you do decide to shave all of it make sure to use vaseline for a few days because it will likely itch.|`|byHh0A3Eaa	LOL no it will no grow out the bottom of your skirt when you're 45 lmao head hair foliciles only live about 7 years and pubes only live about 2 or less, maybe 1.|`|ACnb0UhLaa	first of all you don't shave your vagina, your vagina is inside you...its not like your going ot have a humongous bush down there its just hair, its up to you on what you want to do with it, its your crotch|`|31Xl7M5faa	It's a personal choice. Some women like to have hair and be natural where others like to have no hair.  Not shaving will not cause it to grow huge.  Some women perfer to shave it all, other like to wax, some just like to trim or just shave the bikini sides.  Whatever you choose make sure to do it safely!!!

3KD1wCs5aa	GINGIVITIS is the inflammation of the gums around the teeth due to improper cleaning of the teeth. Although systemic factors and general health can modify the tissue reactions to local irritants, gingivitis at all ages is caused primarily by local irritants. Gingivitis is nearly always reversible. The usual signs of gingivitis are gums which are swollen and bleed during brushing.    Failure to rinse the mouth after meals and brush the teeth results in a thin layer of food and bacteria covering the tooth surface. This bacterium is the chief culprit behind the inflammation known as gingivitis. The gums during this stage of infection become soft, spongy and swollen.    EDIT: Do you have braces?  I had them for 2 1/2 years and I was also allergic to metal.  It never resulted in bleeding gums, but it did result in swollen gums regardless of what a great brusher/flosser/rinser I was.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Damn that's gross!  Do you have braces?  Cause they might cause this to happen - or if you didn't brush well enough or floss?  Sounds like gingivitis, that's all - just a bad case of it.  Probably brought on by stress or a venereal disease like syphilis or herpes, hopefully not the last two.|`|tEmnBO5Kaa	Bleeding gums means more flossing!  You should brush twice a day and floss once a day at night.  Warm salt water rinses  wont hurt either, and get cleaning once every six months. This should solve this problem.|`|uEYckSYVaa	infection, not cleaning your teeth properly
GXiCrhVYaa	Unless you really know what you are doing, it is not a good idea to ignore your doctor's advice and to self-medicate.     You were taking dosulepin for 6 years and I wonder if it was helping you, or if it helped for a while but then stopped working. That is the time doctors start to change meds. Dosulepin strikes me as an unusual choice because it is an old medication that is not used much anymore. This kind of med is called a tricyclic antidepressant, and they tend to have more side effects than more recent meds.    Citalopram is a much newer med and is called an SSRI (like Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, etc.). I really don't suggest mixing two different kinds of meds without talking to your doctor first. If you want to read a little about these two meds, check out the links below. Wish you the best.|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	I would follow the advice given to you by your doctor. Why would you want to or need to take the dosulepin anyway if you have citalopram?    Vik|`|niVQkQ35aa	Not a good idea.  I'm sure there is a reason your doctor changed your medications.  It's best to follow the doctor's instructions.  If you have questions, talk to your doctor.
U9bgWBWZaa	I had about 10 on my right foot and needed a way to remove them too. I bought Dr. Scholl's Clear Away plantar wart remover and tried it with a small one. It wasn't a bit painful and it worked! I am now using for all of the other ones.|`|5pszijaDaa	they make over the counter medications that "freeze" the wart off of you foot with a couple of treatments. i think dr sholes or someone makes it. go to your pharmacy and ask, they should know what you are talking about. and if used as directed it shouldn't hurt very badly.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	You can pick up the patch for planters warts at your local drug store and they don't hurt at all.Just follow the directions and your set.
gcVeEbiNaa	Have you already had Chicken Pox? If not it could be the start of them.   Also if you have had Chicken Pox another possibility could be Shingles. Shingles can start out as a rash that doesn't itch, but can spread very quickly. Shingles can later (in a few days) become itchy and painful!   This could also possibly be an allergic reaction. Take a Benedryl and see if it helps the rash.  If it spreads anymore see your doctor!|`|U9bgWBWZaa	Have you been in a wooded area? If so it is possibly chiggers... but those would itch. Possibly acne.|`|6HMgT5LCaa	A rash.|`|NeWr6cY8aa	You have brain cancer!|`|ccdcd68a4dddec010adb20f75fbc5e16aa	Well I've had my share of horrid skin problems.  But I don't honestly know.  My guess is that you are a bit dehydrated and it's just dry skin, but usually that's itchy too.  Razor burn but you would know that already.  Probably an allergic reaction to something.  I once laid my arm on a dirty school lunch table and I developed a weird rash with bumps similar to yours but it also itched.  But maybe its just an allergy.|`|wUfEbrdUaa	A friend of mine had that few years back but on her thighs.. she got worried but turned out that they magiccally disappeared with time, so just wait but if your really worried, go see your doctor.

My husband, a cook for many years, has often tossed out  things that were questionable.  Always reciting what his Mom taught him.    "If in doubt, throw it out."|`|v2ZBawa7aa	No.  If it is under pressure, which is what it sounds like, it sounds like it was infected with bacteria.|`|Au0HK3O6aa	Would you risk a dose of diarrhoea for the price of a can of tomatoes.

YoZZDqq9aa	Contact your step sister's county government office. They'll tell you how to connect to the local social services agency (you don't need to tell them why, and I doubt they'd ask). Once on the line with social services, tell them you're out of town, but you believe your step sister is having some significant difficulties with her mother, and could they contact your step sister to follow up? I don't think this would be unreasonable for you, or them to do - and it may save your step sister a lot of grief. Good luck. Be sure you can tell them her address and phone number.|`|76845aa2d3f727081f73b3db267a28b8aa	Someone will have to go with her to social services and they can help appoint someone to over see things and help handle her money.|`|JCJK16MXaa	are you in the uk?

f5f2cbaa7f2dc242e7b6f95e3a1514daaa	Well, they say that by 16 you should have your period at latest [late bloomers]. If you don't you should go to the doctors to get checked. They could diagnose you with polycystic ovary syndrome[POS] and in turn put you on birth control to regulate your periods and hormones. It's best to get these things checked because once something happens, it's hard, if not impossible, to correct, like side effects to having POS, which is not something you would want.   Also, it could just be that you have irregular periods, as mentioned above. They don't regulate right away and sometimes take years to do so, maybe wait a month or two and see what happens. If nothing does, then speak to your mother and get it checked out.   =]|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Since that was your first period, it is normal that they will not be regular from the beginning.  It takes time for your periods to become normal.  But you should be able to talk to your mom about your period.  Every woman has to go through it and since I am sure she has she will be able to answer any questions you may have about them.  Do not be scared to talk to your mother.  What is there to be afraid of.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Its really OK...many of us have really irregular periods when we start...some are like that for a few months others girls may take years to get regular....and some may never get regular.

It is perfectly normal for your period to be irregular when you first start or even within the first few years. You could always get put on birth control if you dont like the idea of not knowing when you will start. Birth control will regulate your cycle and you will receive your period monthly. Just try not to stress yourself out if you do not get it each month. Stress and sometimes weight change may affect your cycle too.|`|JqvSEBIqaa	This problem does not sound normal.  You need to be seen by a gynacologist.  He or she will take some blood and have some tests done.  He or she will also examine you vaginally.  Your health is nothing to play around with.  If your Mom will not take you then see the nurse at school and tell her the situation and that you are concerned about it and want to find out what is wrong and why you are having this problem!!!  Hope that helps you dear and I hope you do get some help.|`|0Rokad7Uaa	that's no problem. don't worry|`|E9wf9vfDaa	your period is still irregular. it's normal to not have a regular every month period when you've just started. you can miss a period if you're really active too. since, you're not pregnant, or whatever, don't worry about it because i used to miss my period for two months at a time and stuff because i'm really active. it takes time. but if you're really worried talk to the doctor.|`|Cz6DDI6laa	no mine comes like every 6 months but have u had sex if u have them u may want to talk a pregency test but problay not

Heavy lifting and ab exercises are generally NOT advised, unless your doctor or other health conditions suggest otherwise.  ,
XzV4bUeFaa	If you are receiving regular Social Security Disability you can be a millionaire.  This is the money due you from working and paying into social security before becoming disabled.  If you are receiving Supplemental security income from Social Security, then NO you can't have over a certain amt. in assests set by the govt. and still qualify.  Even in this case, if you have a car that's older and isn't worth much it might not affect your benefits.  So, make sure you know what you are receiving and just how much you are allowed to have in assests if it is SSI.

ppNm3MORaa	Foot odor is often caused by a bacterial infection of the skin on the feet due to excessive sweating and the accumulation of dead skin on the feet. Consider Epsom salt and warm water soaks and the application of an over the counter topical antibiotic. In addition cleaning the feet with hydrogen peroxide may also help. If you have diabetes or a problem with circulation in your feet consult your doctor before trying any home treatment. When you shower dry your feet very well with a towel that you change often. Dead skin often accumulates and you want to remove as much of this dead skin as you can without causing pain. Make sure that you change socks during the day if your feet sweat and alternate shoes. Spray the shoes with a safe foot over the counter foot spray. Also consider making an appointment with a podiatrist in your area.|`|rkdsrfGdaa	baking soda maybe? like arm and hammer?
mAp90hEeaa	It is probably the medication and calling 911 would be inappropriate.  Taking some tylenol or ibuprofen regularly will take care of the cramping.  Call your doctor and tell him about the symptoms (there is usually an emergency number listed for after hours when you call the clinic number).  The doctor on-call can then give you advice.|`|SPMS5yIuaa	This is very dangerouse you have to tell your mother to take you right away.

A3SXq0Uoaa	first of all it is not your fault. many things can make someone to commit suicide. first of all you should try talking to your brother. a reason why people commit suicide is because they are sad. if you try to make him feel better by talking to him and joking, he'll feel loved. you should also monitor how sad he feels.|`|up363TZyaa	it's NOT your fault.  you're brother may seem like he's not listening to you, but he probably is. deep down, he's probably happy that you care, and you have to keep letting him know that you care about him. tell him everyday that he is important to you. his counselor will also help him.|`|kjiU737Waa	it's not ur fault. talk to ur parents|`|YoZZDqq9aa	OK, let's say he does it tonight.

DO SOMETHING!|`|8TVYDSB5aa	All I can suggest is that you tell someone. Because I can't even imagine the pain of losing a sibling to suicide.   I hope everything works out.    *EDIT: Oops, I just read the "extra info" or whatever it's called. Just explain to him how much you need him to stick around, and how much you love him.

Obviously, a long term approach is always best.     Here's one suggestion that you may find useful:     The 'Maximum Fat-Loss Protocol'.    1. Wake up and have a strong coffee.  2. Exercise for 30-60 mins.  3. Wait 30 mins.  4. Have breakfast.    I hope this helps.

This made me lose like 3 pounds every 2 days and it makes you lose actual fat..i was given this diet by my personal trainer before training for a pageant and i got cut up (btw this is my brothers account)
amXoeVKYaa	Try wearing earring studs that are bigger than the hole.   If not, you should wear earrings that dangle or hoop earrings  since you can poke it through your ear and then clasp it to lock.    Your ear hole stretched out and you can't shrink it back but you can  always wear earrings bigger or hoops/dangles.    :o)
qXnfaN9Zaa	well you'll get high for about 10 minutes but all it does is burn a hole through ur nasal cavity if you keep doing it and it burns like hell when you first sniff it
S1jddreQaa	Oh yeah I hated just using pads, I ALWAYS leaked at night. But I bought over night pads and I used then at night. I don't have many leaks at night anymore. You should try always overnight pads, they work pretty good. I don't think the way you sleep affects it much.|`|RmjuKcNtaa	Uhh I certainly do not have this problem, but maybe sleeping on sideways is better for ur period. Whenever I sleep on my side, nothing ever comes out. But then when I get up, its a huge fountain and I usually rush to the bathroom *snickers* But yes, u shud try that. I know its uncomfortable, b/c i hate sleeping on my side but oh well >  Also u may want to consider doubling ur pads?|`|SIwbZ2ACaa	Well, I have it REALLY bad too! I should use a towel but I don't, I just use the normal pads which cause even more trouble!|`|6JEhoZ08aa	I use an old sheet for the bed, folded over twice. Then I just wash it when my period is over and use it again next time. You are not alone.|`|oamqoWn9aa	You are definitely not alone!  I really don't think there is anything you can do besides wearing pads made especially for nighttime.  Maybe you can take a shower before bed, that may make it a little less, um...messy. The overnight pads have better protection from leaks.  Here is the link:  http://www.always.com/products/detail/ap...    Hope this helps!|`|qttFnNz7aa	ok same problem here ...  just buy the always maxi overnight extra heavy pads  (they are big and purple !)  ( ...there frkn huge but they work ...  def save you some towels and the embarrasment of cleaning the towels ...|`|mZprL9TJaa	you may want to talk to your doctor about the heavy bleeding. You may want to consider birth control pills because they make your periods really light and you only bleed for a couple of days. I used to have really heavy periods but since i've been on birth control it is much better.|`|378GRzrnaa	get thick pads|`|ssrLnvvWaa	i have this problem too i have to wear the overnight pads because i don't like tampons and usually put a towel underneath me. When i have my period i am way to embarrassed to sleep over a friends house. I sleep on my side but i don't think that really has anything to do with it.|`|uly3aFqtaa	If it's so bad that you have to use towels, maybe you should see a Doctor; i've never heard of periods being that heavy.    Are you using Nighttime Pads? They are much longer and thicker than daytime ones.    Try sleeping on your back or side for one night and see if that changes the flow. if not, definitely talk to a Doctor. Is it heavy during the day, too?    Xx.|`|5R3oVfisaa	well my mother had something like that where she had a really heavy period. well when she was a teen she would bleed so bad she wouldn't be able to go out when she had her period because she bled once in a seat and then left. after she had me and my two sisters (she had enough kids) she got that operation to take out her uterus or something so she stopped having periods all together, but you're too young to do that, so I don't know if you have a gynecologist or not I don't, but I began like a year ago with my periods, and mine is kind of heavy but I can still go out and stuff. But my word of advice is if you have a gynecologist go to her, or ask your mom (i know its awkward but whatever u have to do, right?) sleeping on your tummy doesn't really affect I don't think, but I don't think its some huge medical problem. some girls are heavier than others. i don't think you can stop the heavyness but maybe you should do something about waking up in the middle of the night (i know its a hassle but...) to change your pad or whatever your wearing and clean yourself (sorry for the grossness) but it can prevent infection. um and don't wear tampons, its good that they uncomfort u, not to be mean, but don't wear them at night. u might sleep in or something, and you're really not supposed to wear them for more than 8 hours, you might get something called TSS or Toxic shock syndrome, i don't really know much about it, you can research it on google or w/e and get more information. so sorry about your "issue" peace. love. happiness.. hope i helped |`|u0Tdlw5Xaa	Get those really thick overnight pads, they're awesome.    Will save you some towels, too.|`|o88qLRgbaa	There are some really heavy pads that you can layer, and it is fine to use a towel as well. :)|`|hBMn6U4Xaa	use infinity pads it works great 4 me|`|WLShLi04aa	well i'm sure you already wear super absorbancy pads, but it's normal, you're just heavy in the night, i don't have that problem but i'm sure someone else does, so it's totally fine!  but if you want it to get better or anything, you can maybe go on birth control to make it more stable and not so heavy in the night?|`|1HeW6F6qaa	I have to use up to three pads at night, so bleeding excessively is normal if that's how much you bleed. Some people have short, light, 3-day periods, but my family's known for heavier, 5-day periods. It all depends.     And yes, applying pressure to that area can sometimes cause it to come out more.|`|yPAdMJbDaa	YEAH I HAVE THAT PROBLEM.  i do the same thing.  i have poly cystic ovarian syndrome.    but i doubt you have that.  you probably just have a really hevy flow.  youll be alright.|`|9R1P2Ivgaa	i know what you are talking about i personally i hate tampons they have the new infinity pads by always they are extra absorbent and really thin they work for me. i don't think sleeping on your tummy effects anything.  hope this helps.|`|UIbZOOBIaa	I had this problem for the 1st 3 years of having my period and it sux!! I went throu sooo much underware and it was even as bad to during the day I had to use a tampon and a pad as well and changed it like every hour!! You know what helped awsome though!!! not only with the heavyness but with PMS and with knowing exactly when your period is coming. Talk to your doctor about birth control!! Even if your not having sex it is also used to regulate your period, clear acne, help PMS, and lighten up your flow majorly and sometimes even shorten it. I am on the YAZ and I loooove it!!!! I only get my period for 3 days and its very light no cramps nothing!! its awsome!! Im telling you go talk to a doctor about YAZ even if your not having sex. They use birth control not only for not haivng babies but a lot of other things as well. If you dont want to talk to your mom because she mite think your having sex bring her with you and you and your doctor talk to her at the same time to let her know its not just for sex!! Good Luck!|`|AA10026313	You could use a cloth pad or menstrual cup maybe that would help?  Learn more   www.ecomenses.com  http://community.livejournal.com/cloth_p...  http://community.livejournal.com/menstru...  Also try using a heat pad or hot water bottle.|`|3BrOSZujaa	Girl, this is completly normal this happens to me and my mom all the time. try using a good night disposible underwear outside of your regular everyday pantys and pads, nothing is wrong, your stomach is the harvest of your period so if you want less strong periods sleep on your back it is also better for back pains I hoped i help. If this doesn't work contact me or your parents and doctor for more information. Hope I helped and good luck!|`|YLJXyS1iaa	I have this problem also.  I do not think that sleeping on your stomach makes a difference.  Because I sleep to my side and it still happens to me.  My mom got me some pads that they give mothers after they have a baby and they work really well.  They are huge!|`|t2YUn4FYaa	Well idk if its good 2 sleep on your stomach but i sometimes wear adult diapers plus pads. lol
Yu7y6yfraa	Oh me.   Yes, your school nurse would definitely help you.  If it is broken, the pain would probably be almost intolerable.  At least that was my experience when falling on my wrist.  You could also have a sprain.  Your school nurse will know what to do.  Take care.|`|987923b8a7fffddd6d84106ce71d68a3aa	See you school nurse. Maybe she can help.
1EhbLBkUaa	No.    Breasts are almost entirely fat.  Exercises don't change fat, unless you burn more calories by exercising than you eat, in which case you lose weight -- which means they get smaller, not bigger.  So.... the only ways to get bigger breasts are:    1) gain weight  2) be pregnant; and nurse afterwards -- fills them with milk, so they're bigger.  3) get surgery to add implants.  or  4) if you're not fully developed yet, wait for puberty to run its course.|`|aeb6a9eccc02ea073c914dc6ce0edcaaaa	i hate it. theres nothing you can do to make it bigger. i'm pretty flat chested. but really, i'm starting to get over it now. love the body you have. i know many people will tell you taht, but its true. unless you wanna pay thousands of dollars for fake boobs, or gain weight for fat boobs, you wont get any most likely unless you're still a teenager.|`|OdUZ7NNnaa	lol|`|JB8samC7aa	Exercising will only strengthen the muscles that support the breasts, but won't actually increase the volume or amount of breast tissue.    In short, no.|`|nBMVi9t8aa	NO!!! Thats a dum question. Get a implant that will make your boobs bigger.Im ten and i know its not a exercise that make boobs bigger.If u do get an implant u can choose the size you want like a tcups or i call them balloon (the big ones).Im a gurl myself.|`|uly3aFqtaa	Actually, yes.    There are muscles under your breast tissue, and if you increase the size of that Muscle, your Boobs may seem to look bigger. Your actual Boobs will not grow but the Muscle unerneath may push oput the tissue, for the appearance of bigger boobs. I doubt it would make that much of a difference though.    You can also do stretches to make yourself taller. SERIOUSLY.  If you stretch all your Muscles [mainly your back] you can grow upto 3 inches, over a course of a couple of months.    Xx.|`|8qAvEml4aa	yes|`|dXGvp5sVaa	No, of course not. Breasts are fatty tissue, not muscle, and therefore cannot grow unnaturally. The only thing that will make breasts increase in size is naturally produced estrogen. If you gain weight from eating, you will also see an increase in breast size, but this is not what you want because it will result in big breasts but bad health and an unattractive physique (to most).|`|S21rftTmaa	Yes...yes, that..does....work...    WOW...|`|e1c30509c868ec11e6a9ccb3145702efaa	Katie, I am not trying to mock your question but the only exercise that will make your breast bigger is if your run to the nearest plastic surgeons office. As far as I know that is like a man doing penis exercises to make himself bigger. I don't think there is such an exercise.|`|1HeW6F6qaa	Uh no.  They're fatty tissue with milk glands inside, there's nothing you can do to make them bigger. You really shouldn't worry about it..     But I've heard excessive exercising sometimes makes them smaller.|`|378GRzrnaa	no|`|7HWMQ6IZaa	I know a way to make your boobs bigger fast results email me if you want the details at geniacapers@yahoo.com|`|V88BvOnVaa	I have not seen that but exercise like push ups will increase your chest muscle. But if you want to use breast cream I recommend using one that is made of herbal ingredients. I am using one and it helps me a lot.|`|WLShLi04aa	hahahaha hun if that worked every lady out there would be walking around with big boobs  sorry but nope, i wish!|`|u0Tdlw5Xaa	Haha, my dad says it best    "Those aren't boobs, those are pecs!"    Hahahahaha.
nyrXBf6kaa	If you have a regular doctor, then you should be able to call their office & tell them what you've been taking & what else they might suggest you take. If you cannot talk to the doctor, I'm sure the nurses will be able to help you.     Also if you walk into any pharmacy & speak to a pharmacist they can tell you what to take & how much.     These will get you the best & safest results from professionals. I hope you start feeling better, good luck!|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Take something like a belt and wrap it around your head,- over the temples.  Put something underneath the belt, over each temple.  Small ice pack would work well.  The aim is to put pressure over these points.    Lay your head back on an ice back or small pack of ice, so that the middle of your neck has cold pressure on it.      Have someone massage your shoulders and neck.    Apply pressure to the areas on your face .at the end of your eyebrows - close to your nose.  Massage this area.
Q1lP6lSkaa	A low-glycemic index diet (low GI diet) is a diet composed mostly of low GI carbohydrates. Basically low GI carbs raise your blood sugar very slowly over an extended period of time, whereas high GI carbs spike your blood sugar very rapidly. It's sometimes recommended to PCOS patients because people with PCOS have a higher risk of developing Type II diabetes, and a diet filled with high GI carbs is also thought to promote diabetes. You can probably find a lot of information on what foods are high GI versus low GI, but in general:    - Tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, etc) tend to be high GI, whereas "mainland" fruits (blueberries, apples) tend to be low GI    - Breads, including whole wheat breads, tend to be high GI, unless they're made with crushed wheat    - Pasta is low GI (phew!)    - Most grains like bulgur, quinoa, and rice are low-medium GI. The shorter the grain on rice, the higher the GI    - Cookies and cakes are typically high GI    - Beans/legumes are mostly very low GI    - Vegetables tend to be across the board. Personally I don't think people should reject eating any vegetable even if it has a high GI due to the magnitude of other health benefits    - Anything with added sugar tends to be high GI    That's all I can think of off the top of my head. Here's a couple sites with more info:    http://www.glycemicindex.com/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcos    Hope this helped!

c319c1f6090c4e43a1d95dd27b249dfeaa	No, that's why they usually sell those meds behind the pharm counter due to kids buying them just to get high.  I would take the recommended dosage.
EN32vSsCaa	Restoril (temazepam) and its metabolites are detectable in urine for at least 14 days.  If you have a valid prescription for it, you are covered.|`|c319c1f6090c4e43a1d95dd27b249dfeaa	Probably.  I would let them know just in case.|`|mH73PWBhaa	If the test includes benzodiazepines (valium/diazepam, xanax, temazepam etc)...it will show up on a drug test. If the test is just for opiates or illicit substances like ETOH(alcohol), or marijuana(THC) then it won't show up.  If you have a prescription forTemazepam (Restoril) a positive test shouldn't be an issue.    If it's for an employer, the drug company will probably call you directly and ask for proof your authorized to take this medicine. If a prescription for the substance is confirmed through your doctor or pharmacist, then the drug testing lab will report a "clean" test due to patient confidentiality laws.
nUu7tUiqaa	For your thighs, you need to be doing lunges and planks. Those really help. Honestly, being as tall as you are, you can definitely eat more than just 1,200 calories a day. Eat small meals 5 times a day to keep you feeling full. Work out in the morning, as soon as you get up. That way you can knock out your workout and not have to worry about it.    I would do 3 sets of 15 lunges, with a 10 second break between each set.  Then 2 sets of 10 planks, holding the plank for at least 10 seconds.  Then you can finish up with crunches, pushups, or even jumping jacks which helps with legs as well.    Always drink plenty of water.|`|lw8n5BFeaa	wOw, just cutting tha calories is all you need with all the extra activitiezzzzzz|`|erM2TCuWaa	you cant target where the fat you are burning comes from.    you can tone the muscles but you cant do an exercise to remove the fat from that spot      sadly :(

029dfd57698be0abbf06b24b24c17c53aa	If it itches, it means that you have more sensitive skin in this area, or that you have thicker skin in that area. It is caused by your hair trying to grow back and not getting through the follicle easily. (that's where red bumps come from, too.) a lot of women will use baby oils or specialized moisturizers that help with this. Personally, they don't work for me. However, they do make it a bit more comfortable, because the hair doesn't get stuck inside the follicle as easily whenever it's moisturized like this.     If it makes you uncomfortable, just don't do it. A lot of women do, and a lot of women don't. If you don't like how it looks grown in, then try a trimmed look.|`|ni06WWg4aa	If you shave, you need to shave every other day to keep it from itching. You can also use creams but be careful and don't leave them on too long or they can irritate you as well.|`|5oDoPyKTaa	most girls do when they start to get older and more "sexually active" There are special shaving creams to use when shaving "down there" that will make it itch less. The more often you shave, the less it will itch.|`|qqMR9VBcaa	umm some guys like it its better to lick and it looks better send me a pic cause yours might be already good looking.  -Dr. Rojes|`|OP4O5mjnaa	if youre like below the age of 14, then you shouldnt even be worrying about that.  no one is going to see it.  if youre of the proper age to be thinking about this, then yeah shave that shizzle. clean shaven has been the thing for a while now, unless youre from ,sayy, france.|`|8XURx7nzaa	i do because to me it is more clean & its better to for your boyfriend. put some lotion on so it dont itch.|`|J47FzOQmaa	yes omg it does itch im never doing that again! but i trim, its better|`|7ilEjRxeaa	I shave down there.  I never itch. I guess I'm lucky. Haha|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	It's strictly a personal preference/choice.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	lol i never did it in my life and yeah if you do shave it then you could get bumps that hurt like hell..do it when you get older or something but if you wanna do it then use a very clean razor and wash it|`|vR6AwIppaa	no, most people don't shave "down there" lol|`|NIwMSioZaa	uh  yes   my doc said it itches cuz the hair is growing back|`|i8SkPj8qaa	I shave down there and it only itches when the hair starts growing back|`|AA10327722	I shave and yeah it itches when it grows back.  Its not weird that you don't though,  I'd just make sure you trim it.  It tends to get really bushy if you just leave it alone.|`|UIbZOOBIaa	I do!! I hate hair i shave my legs, arms, pussy, armpits, thighs, everything!! Yea it does itch but after a while you get used to it and it stops itching...its cleaner and less bacteria and what not. Plus guys like it a lot better also!!!|`|bgdXfTsOaa	i do only when i know im going to be with a guy that something might happen, it does itch though.  its not weird that you dont lol.   its just kindof nasty to let it get outta hand-  just make sure your hair is short  cut it with sisscors.|`|mZprL9TJaa	i would recommend you just trim the area and not completely shave it because you are more prone to infections like UTI's when you shave. If you do wanna shave they have special gels and creams you can get to prevent itching and razor burn since it is such a sensitive area.

You may not notice it now, but eventually you're going to look like you're molting.
0vx7j8klaa	Black, brown to red is normal. When I started my period in the 7 grade it started off dark brown.  Then it turned red.  If it is black that is normal for some people.  And you said it is a horrid smell. Check with your doctor it might be something else. I am 49 years old and never had a black period.   Thank God you are not sick.    I had cramps and leg pains.   I had pains in my back, mood swings and more. Do you drink 8 to 10 glasses of water a day. Sometime eating sweets can cause a bad smell when you are on your period. You just started your period not to long ago, it should get on track to the right color.  If not i would just check with your doctor.     Good luck!  God bless you  Mary r.|`|iM1i07gEaa	Black isn't exactly normal. Brown usually indicates that your period is ending.|`|JZUn4y6Gaa	It's normal just old blood, it happens to me just as my period is ending.|`|24WMIv9Caa	You should see your Doctor just to be safe.But I think It sounds like It's the end of your period and It's some left over blood.|`|KozoNqpsaa	If this is only your 5th period, I'm assuming you are quite young? You need to ask your mom or whomever you live with or can talk to about these kinds of things. Horrid smell and black in color don't sound normal at all. You need to let someone know about it and possibly see a doctor.  Good luck hon.

kvsdv19Naa	No, there is no workout to make your breasts smaller, mostly because they're made of fat and glandular tissue, not muscle.    What you need is a minimizer bra, which will hold you in so you'll feel more comfortable, and may even flatten you out a bit.  Below is a link to Title 9 Sports, which has an excellent selection of bras/sportswear for every size woman.  38C is not that large, really.  I think that when you're young you may be getting unwanted attention, or that people make assumptions about you that are untrue because of your breast size.        If someone stares, try snapping your fingers in front of your chest and raise your hand (still snapping) until level with your eyes--that will refocus their attention.  People can be rude, but you can only change the way you react to them.    Learn to live with your breasts, and learn to love and accept them!|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	Be thankful for what you have and that you're healthy.  38C is not that big and some girls would love to have it.  Accept your body and appreciate it.|`|yVRpdx5laa	only way is to loose weight. i understand im a size 3/4 and i have full D small DD's it hurts my back and you really can't lose weight in your breast by just losing weight in general. some people store fat in their butt or thighs.. we store it on our chest. its not weird you arent irregular.. some people would consider you lucky but i understand its not always all its cracked up to be. try great fitting bras ( i get victorias secret they have great support and are sexy) and if you can stand to lose a little then try that.|`|5oDoPyKTaa	Wear a couple sports bras to flatten them down.|`|ni06WWg4aa	If you are skinny, no, there is no workout you can do to reduce your size. You sound like you might be young so give it a few years and see what happens. If you are still thin and large breasted by 18 or 20, you can have them surgically  reduced. You are not weird. :)
mqXyDTwwaa	Taking a laxative after dinner once every few days isn't going to help you lose weight. What people do to lose weight with laxatives is a lot more radical, and a lot more disgusting.|`|ZWfPSlu7aa	that sounds so health
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Laxatives do their work in the lower bowel.  The calories from your food are absorbed into your blood stream in your stomach and small intestine and distributed to your body.  Laxatives use drugs to draw fluid from your body into your lower bowel to cause excrement to come out.  I don't recommend that you do this too often, I had a friend that did this and her bowel completely stopped functioning on its own, and she had to have it removed and have a coloscopy for the rest of her life.  However, it is your choice.    best wishes..
OgaJqkSQaa	I like tampons but can't use them anymore because I have recurring bv.   I tried a mooncup but it was HUGE even though I got the smallest size. I kept trying to get it in but it wasn't going to happen. Eventually I got it in, and it really hurt... but it got stuck. I tried all day to get it out and finally managed just before I was about to take myself to a&e. I won't be using it again.  I have to wear sanitary towels now, which I hate because they're so uncomfortable.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	I like to use tampons during the day, and night sanitary towels at night. But most of the time, l don't feel like wearing tampons so l use Always Sanitary Towels. It depends, really. But Tampons are great if they're used correctly. x|`|8wnvhBQTaa	tampons at day & towels at night.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Menstrual cups for sure.      After using all the different options out there (not just tampons, pads and cups) I can say for sure that menstrual cups are by far the best option ever. Im too heavy to use tampons or pads, menstrual cups are great because they hold more flow, they never ever leak and you can wear them for up to 12 hours including at night or with different flow, which you cant do with tampons or pads. Menstrual cups arent any bigger than tampons and they are smooth so they are much easier to use, plus there is nothing to fuss about like tampons or pads so much more convenient. They are FAR cleaner and safer than tampons so there are no health risks like infections, TSS or cancer as you have with tampons, they are also much more comfortable than tampons or pads so periods are easier. Plus they are environmentally friendly, cheap and their companies are ethical.     What about other options though? Commercial tampons, organic tampons, sponge tampons, soft tampons, cloth tampons, padettes, commercial pads, organic pads, cloth pads, homemade pads, period belts, period panties, period blankets, silicone menstrual cups, rubber menstrual cups, diaphragms as menstrual cups, homemade menstrual cups, softcups, free-flow, free-flow layering, free-flow instinctive, extraction and menstrual management  all are different, there is a huge difference between say commercial pads and cloth pads so they count as different options.|`|55a8b612e95cc00ad690f4ebc0759480aa	Cups, I wouldn't use tampons if you paid me as they are totally and utterly gross if you think about it, plus you have to mess about carrying spares and worry about throwing them in the bin - because no they are not flushable! cups are much cleaner and better to use as they never leak and you can wear them whenever for a long time and I like pads at night but only cloth pads coz pads liek Always make you feel all sweaty and totally ewww|`|ni06WWg4aa	Tampons for sure, definitely no pads (smelly) and the cup things are messy.|`|UIbZOOBIaa	I dont know what cup things are!! But I use tampons...I hate pads because they make me sweat and feel like i am wearing a diaper. Tampons you cant feel and are way more comfy. You can choose a size to your flow and I just like them better. Not to mention they are easier to dispose because they flush down the toilet.|`|6MkwsWWZaa	i like tampons because pads are kindy messy but i still sometimes use pads i have never tried the " cup things" ???|`|jOMyHXE3aa	pads|`|3a9d90cd1a771922668e1059f8dad75caa	Those cup things  lol! Do you mean menstrual cups, softcups, diaphragms, or something else? Menstrual cups for me for sure, I used to use softcups which I totally loved but a friend told me to try menstrual cups and they were so much better as they were much easier to use and less fuss.|`|f963cc12ba03c9bbe28a189032a796abaa	CUPS! I totally and utterly love cups because they are a million times cleaner than tampons or pads, more comfortable, they are safe which is a huge plus and you can leave them in at any time for 12 hours without ever leaking which is just fantastic as you can totally forget about your period and its much more convenient.|`|xhz1kWroaa	I use pads a lot more because I can only use the slim-fitting tampons. They usually don't absorb very much.  I would have to use the "super" kind, but those are wayy too large for me... ouch.  I use pads instead, but I DO keep myself as clean as I can.|`|aKhZNd7daa	Well you live and learn Whip, I'd never heard of those cup things until I just read your link but don't think I'll be trying them.  I'll just stick to my box of Tampax !|`|byHh0A3Eaa	everybody love tapcons|`|7ilEjRxeaa	I have no idea what those cup things are.  But I prefer tampons.  They're more comfortable and WAAAAY less messy (:  Pads are annoying to me, they feel dirty and smelly.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	I prefere sanitary towels, as tampons are kinda scary to me (the whole insterting it down there thing lol)|`|OR8hrr0aaa	id love to try the mooncup things maybe i will till then it is a mix of the others.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Tampons, they are cleaner and easier to hide in my bag and ST smell and uncomfortable and I have no idea what the cup thing is|`|YQZoGNOYaa	uhh those cup things are huge. i bought them one time to check it out but there's no way i could fit that up in there. ouch.|`|MnCYICRIaa	tampons during the day and towers overnight.

4d3Md9pnaa	Your friend's disgustingly underweight, unless she's like 4'9.    So what if your friend weighs less?  You are two DIFFERENT people.  If for anything, you and her should be GAINING weight.|`|e3E21fA8aa	omg don't lose any weight if anything GAIN some i was anorexic last year and i got over it and now everyone actually seems to like me better healthy|`|SXiVxfwEaa	ew dont do that girl, guys dont like that. just worry about being healthy.|`|8NvjYY6Naa	Listen I am 10 and I weigh 103 pounds!

OP4O5mjnaa	i honestly didnt start using tampons until i was 19.  i would have used them sooner in life, but i could not figure them out.  i think that pads are the best things for younger girls to use.|`|7ilEjRxeaa	I started a little after I turned 14.  (:|`|LlAfOrduaa	Well, i started at 14, and am 17 now. I only use them once in awhile.|`|6GWctkQzaa	Don't worry. I mean she doesn't want to feel like she wet her pants.|`|OWw3LWDCaa	i started using tampons around 13 14, im now nearly 47, i hate pads.  everyone has their own preference|`|LrA5R3LUaa	i'm 14 and i started using them this yearr.    my mom also thought it was too early for me to start using them, but the reason i use them is because i have really heavy periods and pads just weren't working anymore. i was also not comfortable cause i felt it was gonna go over my pants, but now i feel way mooooreee comfortable since i started using tampons.|`|TU39CRAOaa	im 14, havent had to use them.  and the only situation i would use them right now, would be swimming. like, if i already commit to something having to do with swimming, and get my period, ill have to use a tampon, but other than that, they dont seem appealing in my opinion.|`|X3mNJujTaa	i started using them when i was n the 6th grade, but i was also on a dance team and in gymnastics so a pad was not possible.|`|ZzbjeoMyaa	Well I think whenever she started using them must have felt like the right time for her. So I don't think it's necessarily inappropriate, but I understand why you would think it's sort of a young age to start using them. It all depends on the girl. Some girls use them sooner, some later. And whenever she started using them is completely normal for her personal body.|`|eHRlQKj4aa	i started mine at 13 and started using them like the 3rd or 4th time i got my period, but now i don't use them as often, but its only a year later|`|8njrMiwYaa	I was 12 when i had my period,

TiX5Z4Zbaa	check your blood sugar.|`|j98CkMzVaa	I know exactly. When in the morning you get up all the blood rushes to your feet and you get a week spell. However it may be a lack of something in your diet try eating more slow energy releasing food. You are normal.|`|FqIuY6Qcaa	I used to suffer with this a lot when I was growing up and the doctor never said it was anything serious but that it was my hormones.<br>  The joys of being a girl ay?!|`|AA11101968	It is possibly due to low blood pressure (not a bad thing), does it happen when you stand up quickly?|`|1NSPKg1baa	I have this as well. Sometimes when I stand up I feel like I am going to black out and my vision slowly fades to black and then back to normal. It started when I was about 13.<br>  <br>  The doctor told me it was low blood pressure. Normally when you are lying down and sit up fast, your blood pressure spikes. But in some people, it lowers--this is what was causing it. It could also be low blood sugar. Are you eating enough? If you aren't eating enough, then that's whats going on. Drink lots of water and fruit juices. <br>  <br>  I would go to the doctor though, just to get checked out. Better to be safe than sorry.|`|JLKLbWsyaa	Yes you need to get this checked out! Make an appointment with your family physician to get some type of routine physical.  This problem could be related to low blood pressure due to dehydration, or problems with your blood sugar levels.  They can perform blood tests to determine any blood sugar level abnormalities.<br>  Is this feeling alleviated by eating something???<br>  Good luck to you!|`|OYZDAyihaa	Is it when you stand up after sitting or laying down for a while? if so i have the same problem and end up falling down. it's because of low blood pressure, and if not try to figure out when it happens, after you do something, something you smell, something you see, something you feel, try to find patterns, but if you can't find one, THEN you should talk to your regular doctor about it.|`|nWyvrEX6aa	Get blood work done to make sure it's nothing, but this happens to me a lot and I'm fine. It's like a lightheadedness out of nowhere. I understand completely. This happens to a lot of people. Lemme guess.. the feeling passes quickly? You're fine.|`|TwUAgoxeaa	I would get it checked out.  You might be anemic (low iron).  I have this issue and the doctor told me to take iron vitamins every morning.  I still have days where I feel like that, but it is definitely less frequent.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kv5lGrSdaa	You probably don't have enough iron in your body. Try eating a healthy cereal in the morning. There is also a chance that you can be pregnant.|`|lHfiz2xOaa	Thats happened to me like when I stand up sometimes... i think its bc of ur blood sugar or something... but just 2 be safe   you probably should|`|WF4Z10Paaa	yes for sure see your doctor , it might just be growing pains|`|ujNpFrQQaa	if you're a female than you should be sure that you're not pregnant. Be sure that you are eating a healthy diet and drinking enough fluids, mainly water, to keep things functioning correctly. If you do recreational things (i.e. drugs, drink, etc) lower or eliminate your intake of these because they are probably the cause of it, especially if you're so young.|`|JvvoT9xRaa	Maybe its because when you wake up in the morning.. You stand up too quick.. Try sitting for a while before you stand up.<br>  <br>  OR.<br>  <br>  If you feel like you want to faint RANDOMLY its because of the heat...etc..<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!|`|9m9gHZhpaa	I get that too sometimes. i think its pretty normal, as long as it doesn't happen too often.|`|AA10551261	If it happens as you are getting up out of bed then it's most likely postural hypotension which is a temporary drop in  blood pressure that occurs upon rising from being seated or from laying. <br>  <br>  It sometimes takes a while for the blood to readjust to normal thus causing dizziness, tunnel vision, even possible fainting. Getting up slower next time may help prevent it  by giving your body time to adjust to the position changes.

You are icing and could be pressing too hard as you cannot feel properly due to the swelling and cold. You are doing salt soaks, salt rinsing and more cleaning on top of that. Let your body take over for a minute and see if that helps.|`|xYTagSIyaa	It is more than likely infected and you will need help from an antibiotic, you should see a doctor.  Infections on the face can be serious.
NNSVSXdYaa	First, let me start by saying that you don't "loose" weight, you "lose" it. Second, I lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks by getting a small trampoline (a mini tramp) and jumping on that twice a day for about 30 minutes each time. It doesn't sound like much, but I can assure you I lost a LOT of weight!!    Also, cut out all soft drinks, sugar, candy, etc. Drink a lot of water and watch your fat intake. Don't eat fast food either! I assure you that if you do those things you will lose weight quickly. Be careful, and good luck :)|`|7ilEjRxeaa	There really isn't a healthy way to lose 15 lbs in a short amount of time.    The wisest way lose weight, is aiming about one or two pounds a week.  Anything more than that can mess up your body.
vOUDHws3aa	I almost hate to answer your question because my story does not give much hope...yet...  I have PCOS and have been ttc (trying to conceive) for nearly two years. We found out I was pregnant 01/01/09. I had cramps early on started spotting when I was six weeks along and miscarried at 6 weeks and 3 days. No doctor ever told me until after we'd miscarried that PCOS not only makes it hard to conceive, but can also make it difficult for your body to sustain a pregnancy.   I do have a 7 year old son that we had no problem conceiving but I was 18 at the time, and obviously not ttc (am 26 now) so that could have something to do with it.   Anyhow, I do have one child, and I have many friends with PCOS who have multiple children.  Don't lose hope- it's not impossible to have a baby; it just takes longer to get pregnant and closer monitoring once you are pregnant.  Best of luck!!
PrS7So5Yaa	granola bars and processed foods are not good choices.    Some of my daily snacks are:  - an apple and 10 almonds  - 10 baby carrots and a low-fat string cheese  - a cup of plain low-fat yogurt  - a banana and 1 teaspoon of peanut butter|`|RvPuRmqAaa	Besides fruit, here are my favorite mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks:     - almonds or cashews (less than 1/4 cup)   - slice of whole wheat bread with peanut butter    - pretzels   - baby carrots   - big glass of water to fill me up (if I'm hungry and have no snack)|`|43rgOMSCaa	Almonds are my fav.

AA11524464	I bought a treadmill recently off craigslis* because I was tired of trying to get my daily walks in while trying not to slip and fall on the ice and snow. I just stuck it in the basement and I get about 1-2 miles a day done. If you can't fit a treadmill inside, just get a few aerobic dvd's and work out a few times a week. If you want to work out outdoors, try cross-country skiing!|`|kmYbtC0Daa	go for a jog

q8uIqbVhaa	Hello, you cannot lose weight with just exercising, you also gotta take care of the eating part, of your diet regime. What you need to do is to get some money because diet foods as opposed to normal foods are a bit more expensive. You need to quit eating starchy-carbohydrates like breads, potatoes, rice, cookies, pasta, and all carbohydrates that have starch. And instead get your carbohydrates from green vegetables like brocoli, brussel sprouts and green cabbage, green beans, (all cooked of course). And your other carbohydrates from fruits like apples, oranges, grapefruits, and pears.    On the protein side: you can buy egg-beaters, fat-free cheese, chicken, turkey, 1% milk and tuna-fish, low-fat turkey ham, low fat ham, soy protein, whey protein.    You also need to buy calorie-free drinks and diet sugar like equal or splenda.    Try this diet:    BREAKFAST: a soy-protein pancake for breakfast, made with egg-beaters and soy protein.  Just mix 30 grams of soy protein, 1/2 cup of egg-beaters, 1/2 cup of water, salt and diet-sugar and cook it with cooking-spray like a regular pancake.    LUNCH: 8 or 9 oz of baked chicken, baked turkey or cooked fish with cooked green vegetables of green cabbage, brocoli    DINNER: some green salad with 8 or 9 oz fish and 2 apples for dessert.    coffee and diet-soda between meals    i hope this helps.    Walk 40 minutes (6 days a week)|`|FTs2py0kaa	fast and healthy do not go together.........  eat 1000 calories of anything a day..no salt...a lot of water and walk or run one hour a day.swim is fine also..............all will work and be safe........

VRSUyeqbaa	Autism is a severe developmental disorder that begins at birth or within the first two-and-a-half years of life. Most autistic children are perfectly normal in appearance, but spend their time engaged in puzzling and disturbing behaviors which are markedly different from those of typical children. Less severe cases may be diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) or with Asperger's Syndrome (these children typically have normal speech, but they have many "autistic" social and behavioral problems).     It used to be thought that autism is just a fate that you accept.The good news is that there are now a wide variety of treatment options which can be very helpful. Some treatments may lead to great improvement, and others may have little or no effect, but a good starting point would be the parent ratings of biomedical interventions, which presents the responses of over 25,000 parents in showing the effectiveness of various interventions on their own child.     ARI's Diagnostic Checklist, Form E-2, was developed by Dr. Bernard Rimland to diagnose children with Kanner's syndrome (which is also known as 'classical autism'). Many parents and professionals have also used the E-2 checklist to assist in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  You can print out, complete the checklist, and then mail it to ARI for scoring. Our staff will analyze the responses and send you a score along with an interpretation. The checklist is available in 17 different languages. There is no charge for this service.    How Common is it? For many years autism was rare - occurring in just five children per 10,000 live births. However, since the early 1990's, the rate of autism has increased exponentially around the world with figures as high as 60 per 10,000. Boys outnumber girls four to one. In 2007, the Centers for Disease Control reported that 1 in 150 children is diagnosed with autism.    What is the Outlook? Age at intervention has a direct impact on outcome--typically, the earlier a child is treated, the better the prognosis will be. In recent years there has been a marked increase in the percentage of children who can attend school in a typical classroom and live semi-independently in community settings. However, the majority of autistic persons remain impaired in their ability to communicate and socialize.|`|lgCuX7PAaa	Go to    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism|`|thEv91qdaa	well I go to a school with a lot of autistic kids and from what I have seen most of them are really smart but have troubles in social situations and they alway seem to hate being in trouble
63a5e4aa71cbea07611f89f87df0073eaa	Give yourself a break.  Not every one is a math wizard - and if you keep comparing yourself to the other people in your family, you are bound to make yourself more and more unhappy.      There is NO mistake in your being you.  You have the right to not be great at math and need more time to understand concepts, get tutoring, and maybe never to be a math wizard.  So what if math isn't your strength?  As long as you have enough to do the things you need to in school and life, you will be fine.    Feeling like giving up is a natural reaction when you feel pressured to perform.  I would talk with the math teacher and your school guidance counselor if you keep feeling like quitting or find no point in trying, especially if you find it difficult to talk with your parents about your grades.  If your mom and dad realize how frustrated you are and how unhappy you feel, they might be more supportive of your having math tutoring or maybe even learning skills testing.      In the end,  you need to communicate the feelings you are having with the teacher or your parents - or both.  You obviously care about your grades enough to be bothered by the low scores - and talking about it with them can at least show them that you want to do better or at least understand it more.    Take heart.  We have all faced subjects or classes which were more difficult for us than they were for our parents, siblings, or friends.  This too shall pass.|`|2br8X2Ubaa	No don't! Do you realize how important math is? Math is all around you, everything you see has something to do with math. It is so important. I think you should consider getting a tutor, which is nothing to be ashamed of. Please don't give up >.|`|iAIqrKMQaa	try to concentrate learn more and study if math is really that important to you then when ever you have free time study math instead|`|3Gg0LXEOaa	No don't quit. I take all the notes my teacher writes down and when he explains why I write it down so I can look back, I'm not a math wiz either I'm bad but it helps I am getting better at math. Try looking for a problem already done and look for a problem similar and solve it using the steps that should really help too. Don't give up|`|Bt5m6jVTaa	Don't quit... try getting a tutor or ask your math teacher to spend some extra time with you explaining something in the morning or after-school.    And life goes beyond school. Just rememeber that. Your parents might keep pressing education as the "only way", but other things can bring you success. Until you know what that is, keep trying at school and finish it, all the way, to college and beyond :D|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	I know it's easier said than done, but don't get discouraged because it seems everyone in your family is a whiz at math. Everyone has a strength or weakness, and you just have to find yours. When I was in school I had a really difficult time understanding math. No matter how hard I tried, I didn't do well. Ask your parents to get a tutor for you. They might be able to explain the material in a way that is simplified and easier for you to understand.     Don't quit, hang in there.|`|JAHDTBp2aa	I'm horrible at math too! I HATE it!!! Instead of beating yourself up over math, focus on the subject(s) you are good at! Then put your all into excelling!|`|YQKju5xRaa	maybe you could ask someone in your family to help you study .  or ask your teacher for help . you could also get some tutoring.   but don't feel ashamed of yourself, just try harder . (:|`|69GgJhnWaa	Not everyone will always excel at the same things, but that does not mean it's impossible. You know your not very good at math, therefore you're going to have to put more effort into it to succeed than other people. I stink at math, I know I stink at math. That is why I have a tutor and make sure to do ALL of the practice problems for all of the sections to make sure I really understand what I'm doing. For those of us who don't quite get math, we're not going to learn it without a lot of practice and repetition.Quitting is just pathetic unless you've tried every avenue. Also, I KNOW you're teacher will help after school if you ask|`|NvCcdszsaa	I failed with a final mark of 34% and that was with me staying afterschool. I think u should talk to ur teacher and see if they can explain completely the things u are REALLY having trouble wiht and practice a bunch. like usually u fail because u know hoiw to do it but keep making the same mistakes. if ur in highschool, if u get 40 or higher, u can take applied math to make up for credits if u failed. that if ur in a smart school. Ohh and uhmm grade 9 math is heaven compared to grade ten, be prepared to pull up your socks, i gurantee it if u cant do 9 math, go into to a slow class. grade 10 is te hardest grade.|`|wVyUdJJzaa	get someone to tutor you, gr 9 math is pretty easy but thats cuz i take tutoring and i skipped 2 grades for that|`|GtS8EJY9aa	no, just ask for one-in-one help by either a family member, close friend, or the teacher.|`|e86ec010e6282a54a3c30f1ae8380bc2aa	Just get yourself a decent pocket calculator and call it a day with the tests.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	dont quit maybe ask your mom or dad to help you out and dont match yourself up to the rest of your family you have your own strenths you just need to find them    P.S. its more fun to be orriginal than to be just like everyone else|`|YdWLfV4Eaa	Don't make the same mistake I did. Go through with all your courses. I would have to say just make sure you are ALWAYS doing the homework. Even if you know the stuff, do it just to prevent you from losing that edge.|`|Oh2wVMkyaa	well being that ur family are math wizards try getting help after school|`|ezTEBMVyaa	no kid, math just isn't your thing thats ok, all my sisters are horrible in math, and I'm the only one good at it, but i'm horrible in english and they're all good at it, just try your hardest right now and study, just get through high school math and one or two college math courses and your done with math in school, you'll find what you're good at, you never know  what happens
5kXxr6r0aa	ah biceps... while they're generally considered the "cool muscles" they're also some of the cruelest muscles there are. cause the hard truth is, that cut in the bicep along with its peak, are purely genetic, and there is little you can do to change the shape or location of your biceps.    what you can do is focus workouts doing only parts of a curl, like the middle and final upward motions of a bicep curl, if focussed on, can create the optical illusion that the cut in between your bicep and your forearam is deeper than it actually is.      hope that helps, and good luck with your goals!|`|mvJXPDLgaa	I love you too :D
qu7DSLTqaa	The Malt flavored ovaltine has the same chemical as turkey that makes you drowsy...make it warm with milk. Don't take anything to make you sleepy, you will be drowsy tomorrow! Also, you may wake up in a few hours and not be able to get back to sleep! Go to your room, double check your alarm (you know you will later if you don't!), turn off all lights/tv, etc. If you can fall asleep to music, put it on low (I tend to stay awake singing along if it's not instrumental! LOL). Relax and don't think about anything!   Good luck!|`|L6DFPXo6aa	Drink warm milk and stay away from the computer, television, anything with bright, stimulation lights.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	You are at the perfect age for the start of menopause and 52 is the average age that it ends.  You will have those nasty hot flashes, mostly in your chest up to your head and even break out into a sweat on your forehead and chest.  You can also have night sweats and even wake up in a damp bed.  Periods can become closer together, be lighter (less days) at first, then start to be missed entirely.  Menopause is a process and is over when you have gone an entire year without having any periods at all.  Menopause is caused by the loss of production of estrogen and many women will gain weight in their stomach.  Estrogen is the hormone that protects us from getting the "beer gut" that men have, but once the protection is gone, weight tends to collect in the mid section.  You might also start to experience dry skin everywhere, face, arms, legs, etc.  By the way, I'm not guessing at this, been there, done that.  However, on the light side, after that full year of no periods, you don't have to worry about getting pregnant so it has its good points, too.    hope this helps..|`|0F96YQ4Kaa	I believe that your doctor have give advice about how to deal with these unpleasant symptoms. Different women have different experience during menopause but some in common. Beside hot flashes, there are other sign like mood swings, insomnia, weight gain and more.    What you need to do is to find a natural way to relief these symptoms so that your life can go as normal.|`|vR6AwIppaa	~slight memory loss  ~mood swings|`|pDkJeELFaa	hot flashes really bad mood swings. And like it said 12 months of no period and I guess there could be a pre state to menopause.
1JSblCBsaa	the POP only pills are supposed to be okay for women in your situation and are given out by doctors as safe but to be honest I haven't seen conclusive evidence, there are still some doubts floating around.    You can also get a copper IUD. There is another IUD one with a hormone but I don't know if that is safe for your situation because I've forgot what hormone it is.      If you are really desperate there is always the old fashioned but completely hormone free "diaphragm" which you put inside you to try and seal out the swimmers. But I think it's only about 70% affective or something like that. And it needs to be left in for a while afterwards etc..|`|OWw3LWDCaa	go ask your doctor he/she knows your medical history.|`|96827f15b3cc218a65143db6531a248daa	ask your doctor
YlzDl7NRaa	I'm 13 as well. What I do is, 3 times a week I do Pilates on a dvd that I have. You can buy them almost anywhere. Also, ask your mom to enroll you in dance classes. That's what I do. Like ballet and hip-hop or something. And get magazines like Seventeen for example. They have workouts in their magazines and you should do them about 3 times a week as well as the Pilates. You will see results quickly. :)|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	ok first go on a diet or play wii last you need to exercise run the mile|`|AA11579568	No such thing. You can either lose weight by cutting back calories and excercising, which is not fast but is safe, or you can do something really unhealthy like starve yourself or contract a tapeworm.|`|RX9rGdXAaa	yes they can, eat right and excercise, is the onyl weigh for a girl at a young age|`|EfaQpsd5aa	go jog or do exersise like hula hooping, jump ropeing and stuff..(and if your really lazy, do WII FIT! lol)|`|GProy7Mkaa	Try running for maybe 5 minutes and slowly increase the time each day. You can't just stop eating and drop all your weight quickly but there are things you can do to help you lose some weight. Try lifting light weights for light muscle mass it'll tone you up. Eat more healthy filling foods like apples, bananas, vegetables, fish, etc. Stay away from breads, pastas, etc. and any excessive junk food. Night snacking is also not good to do because you can't burn the weight overnight, so if your in the mood for junk food and you HAVE to have it, try having it earlier so you can burn it off during the day. Hope this helps!|`|5OgYMv1oaa	hah this gets really annoying.  i think you should live life and love life.   and love yourself. losing weight really   isnt too important for a 13 yr old girl.   i mean if you really are overweight and need  to lose weight talk to your doctor.   just dont be stupid about it.   it can really screw things up with your body.
eb1780ce939707adb54995676c91778faa	Mario Badescu drying lotion. It's great for fresh pimples. You got a cotton swab and dab some of this pink stuff directly on your pimple before you go to bed. It smells funny, but when you wake up, you'll notice that your pimples smaller.
1SKN7SoDaa	Right. I've had quite a lot of experience in operations.....I've had 9 myself.<br>  <br>  Just try to be calm as you lie down and wait. If they allow you, have someone you know there to hold your hand. After it's been done, of course you have to stay in the hospital for a while so you can recover. You do get quite bored, so I suggest taking some things to do; books, games, phone, etc.....I've never been sick after an operation, so I think that isn't something to worry about. <br>  For my past 8 operations, I had the anesthetic mask, but I can't remember what that was like. But for my most recent one, I had the injection done. When they put into you, you feel weird, but I can't describe it. It doesn't take long to drop off; and I remember myself saying; "I feel weird". Then you just close your eyes, and the next thing you know your either being wheeled into your room (which happened to me), or you are in your bed.<br>  Since my last operation was the first time I had the anesthetic through injection, my body wasn't used to it, so I would describe the feeling as constant 'fizzing'. I kept moving around, twisting and turning, and for some reason, my tummy didn't feel sore even though I was turning on it (the operation was done around my tummy area). My throat also felt slightly tingly. But after 10-15 minutes or something; it stops and you can just relax.<br>  So if you're getting the anesthetic through injection; this is probably what you will expect since it's your first time.<br>  Hope all goes well, good luck, and don't worry! ;)|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	I am a surgery nurse and I have had the surgery.  If you get sick, there are great meds they give you through your IV.  It stops it really good.  Just tell them if you feel sick.<br>  <br>  I had more than just septum surgery.  I had sinus surgery,too.  I was having really bad headaches.  The pain from surgery wasn't as bad as the headaches I had before the surgery.  You will go home after you are good and awake.  Make sure you eat a pack of crackers and drink some, before you leave the hospital.  This will help you on the ride home not to get sick.  Also, you will know if you can hold food down BEFore you leave.|`|XTDeAfTqaa	I've had 4 back surgeries. Being put under is a unique experience. The first time I didn't even know I had been put under. They asked me to start counting backwards from 100 and by the time I reached 85 I asked them when I was going to fall asleep and they told me that the surgery was over. I was out for two hours and never even knew it! You will be groggy for a couple of hours but you'll be fine.<br>  My sister had the surgery you are having. She just had some mild discomfort.|`|WF4Z10Paaa	have had surgery before but not what your having but when you awake u feel fine and they give u something for the pain if needed good luck|`|9xXxMGCeaa	when you go under you wake up feeling grawgy and as if you missed acouple of hours that you don't remember most of that day you sleep, the next three days are most pain full its easy to say don't worry but its ok to be scared you will get threw just fine i did.|`|pX3e0AMdaa	I didnt have the type of surgery you had, but i did have surgery last year, and when i woke up I was in pain and verrryyy verryy tired!|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I have had three surgeries, but not the same one. I did not get sick from the anasthesia, but you should expect it to take at least 24 hours to get out of your system. You will be very sleepy.<br>  <br>  Going under is very interesting. Most of the time you are unaware of the moment you fall asleep, but with anasthesia, you can feel yourself going to sleep.<br>  <br>  You should be aware that anasthesia can make some people very constipated. TMI maybe, but it can become a big issue if you tend towards that. If you're worried, ask the doctor and nurses about getting some Colace and keep yourself dosed until you go.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	The first thing is to follow your doctor's instructions to a "T" since any deviation from them could cause major problems for you.  For example, they will instruct you not to take aspirin, alcohol, Vitamin E or blood thinning meds for several days if not weeks prior to surgery.  That is because some simple meds can cause excessive bleeding, which you don't want.  If they instruct you not to eat or drink after a set time the night prior to surgery, listen to them. Fluids or food in your stomach can cause you to vomit and choke during or immediately after surgery.<br>  <br>  Be truthful with your medical people and let them know of any drugs that you may be taking. If you have any allergies to medicines or substances you must tell them.  Other than that, the surgery is fairly common.<br>  <br>  They will probably start up an IV on your arm and administer some medication that will make you very calm and sleepy.  If they ask you to count from 100 backwards you probably won't make it past 98. They will monitor your breathing all through the surgery.  When you wake up you may feel some pain but they will give you more meds if you tell them that you are hurting.  Sometimes by the time you say you feel pain you will fall asleep again, maybe for several hours.<br>  <br>  In the days following surgery, it's not unusual to feel groggy or tired. It's all due to the anesthesia.  In no time you will heal and you'll be laughing with your friends again.
79eBn6V8aa	i didn't really have a boyfriend until i was 18...i went on a few dates and kissed a few boys, but never thru high school.  I've had lots since then...don't worry...it'll happen for ya|`|mWZE7gF7aa	Girl!  Everyone has that at 16!  You certainly aren't alone...everyone wants to feel loved...unfortunately at your age, it won't be the lasting love that you might be desiring.  Wait it out.  Make friends, get a hobby...and please STAY AWAY from those sappy movies that portray love in a manner that is absolutely unachievable even as an adult.  I promise you.  I think those movies were designed to make women unsatisfied in their current state, whether dating or married or whatever...Remember that happy couple is PAID to be that way...love is hard work...and you just aren't ready for that at your age...enjoy your youth!|`|o34YHLiraa	Well it isn't a matter of right or wrong, but I will tell you that it's perfectly normal and that just about everyone feels this way when they are your age. Heck, people feel this way even when they're old... humans are social creatures and we crave intimate (emotionally, not necessarily sexually) social relationships.    So there's nothing wrong with you, you're just human. And as they saying goes, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.

Frozen fruit and vegetables are a good choice too, read the packaging for its fiber and vitamin contents just to be sure though. Fruit juice is healthy, but does not contain fiber. Make smoothies for yourself instead. To increase your fiber intake even more, buy whole wheat products instead of white, and read nutrition labels for fiber content. I have recently begun buying these chocolate granola bars called "fiber Plus" not only do they solve chocolate cravings but they only have 120 calories (vs. the Fiber Ones which contain a little more fat and 140 calories) and 9 grains of fiber. Don't just rely on high fiber packaged products for your daily intake, fresh fruit and vegetables are necessities for healthy living.

One of the was acai berry, rachel ray and oprah both featured this new amazing healthfood. its full of antioxidents and very good for you. You may want to look into trying some supplements along with proper diet.
5T4TcTzWaa	running is good for you (1 hour or 30 minutes it does not matter)  also if you are sitting down you would want to move your feet in a up and down motion.    Also walk around and move more.    you can try eating soup likw vegtable soup  or you don't like it then go with plain soups
GiUTgnHMaa	EWW! thats never happend to me before. ok here are the steps you HAVE TO TAKE before something you will regret for the rest of your life will happen.    1. Tell your parents.    2. Talk to a trusted teacher or counselor.    3. Tell the principal!!!    4. If nothing can be done switch out of that class.    5. avoid him as much as you can in the hallways!|`|Oh2wVMkyaa	tell someone immediatily and do not go anywhere alone with him no matter what he says. tell ur parents and the office at your school.|`|bpxyGWrYaa	Report that lulzy bastard to the principal.|`|rVdcXJ8aaa	TELL ur parents!!!!!!|`|TNNSHdypaa	Report him to the Y!A police, they'll take care of it.|`|6fjMtWboaa	You need to go to your principal, this man has crossed boundaries he has no business crossing.

Q2UDhYgkaa	Sounds like the right amount to me. The only thing I would do is stop putting sugar in everything - not because of the calories but because sugar is bad for your teeth and not great for your body. But if your doctor is telling you to eat more sugar to get your energy levels up thats another thing.    I have to say the rest was super healthy though.|`|AA11967630	I am on a new program built not only for weightloss but for optimal health. What you are consumming is perfect you will not lose weight from what you are eating but you will not be gaining either. You are choosing wisely  and conciencely about what you are putting into your body but you are by the sounds of it taking excellent care of your health not only physically but mentally as well with what you ar eating. Just be sure to add a little more fat or protien in there more often though cause to me you seem to be avoiding fat all together. \you still "need" a little here and there. 1 fat per meal..fish, olive oil, or nuts. 2 sevings of whole grain a day, and at least one fruit per meal and 4 different colors of veggies per meal. The darker the better.

ccded6c1859c9ef04f029c1502be58d9aa	Normally, a person's blood pressure will not decrease with increased exercise. It is when you stop exercising that you will get a drop in BP. If you do a '5 minute cool down' you will get a drop in BP. If you stop exercising and do not allow a cool down, you will probably feel light-headed,a stand still after exercising may cause some people to faint.      Here is what going on:    When the muscles stop contracting, there is no longer a 'pump' to send blood back to the heart. The heart responds by lowering cardiac output, and blood pressure drops.     Concentrations of metabolic byproducts (such as lactic acid) remain in the bloodstream, which causes blood vessels in the muscle to remain dilated. This allows blood flow in these areas to remain high, resulting in a fall in blood volume of the heart, which lowers BP.     Body temperature increases with exercise. That causes the blood vessels in the skin to dilate in order to lose the extra heat. This also reduces blood volume in the heart.|`|6lE0ij7waa	It happens to me and I feel like passing out. I think it's a lack of oxygen to the brain because of less blood flow.
vR6AwIppaa	secret sucks.  i had the same problem as you. i asked a question on here how to stop it, and someone said certain dri. i went to the store and bought it, put the antiperspirant on b4 i went to bed, deodorant on when i woke up, and there wasn't any sweat at all! it had worked miracles.  p.s. buy the roll-on kind.    good luck! ^^|`|0Umym3h9aa	This is a tough one. I am going to give you some suggestions that may or may not work. Depending on the degree of your sweating it may work for you.    -Wear an under shirt. This can be just a light white T that you wear underneath whatever shirt you are wearing. The extra shirt could help absorb the sweat.    -Wear baggy shirts. If your skin has more room to breath then it may not sweat as much.    -Keep cool by wearing only a light shirt. Try to relax throughout your day and don't let stress bother you. Stressing out or getting mad can greatly increase your sweat.     -Try the above with the combination of a clinic deodorant. You can ask a pharmacist at your local drug store to see if they carry it.     -Drink lots of cold fluids. If your body is hot it will sweat more to try and cool down. If you drink plenty of H2O then you can keep cool and you won't need to sweat.|`|PrS7So5Yaa	You may need clinical strength deodorant. My sister has to use it. It costs a bit more than the regular kind but it works better.

8skV9ze9aa	No, you won't go blind. I'm 18 and when I was 14 my prescription was about the same, if not worse. Right now I'm around -5.15 in the left and -4.85 in the right. Usually, it's all about the shape of the eye, once it stops growing around age 21 it'll level off and it won't get much worse until you reach old age. Personally, my eyes have leveled off a little early, I haven't needed a new prescription in a couple years.    Blindness is caused by a lot of different problems but they're largely unrelated to simple near/farsightedness. Being near/farsighted will increase your risk of those problems slightly, but it most definitely won't cause blindness by itself.     Besides, -4.25 isn't bad, and if you can see well with -3.75 then the eye test for the new glasses was skewed a bit in some way. If you get to -7.00 or so then start worrying, but at this rate that shouldn't happen until you're in your 80s or 90s.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	Your eye prescription will always get worse as the years go by. You won't go blind.  The worst that could happen is you're 40 years old and wearing bifocals, but that isn't bad.|`|AA11481862	no lol i was worried too that i might  go blind too cus my eyesight is bad  im 14 as well, so lol yeah|`|uQjqfSFyaa	go blind?      retard.|`|E9zTGoYyaa	I have myopia so -4.25 is not bad...not when I have -7.00. Your prescription will change as you grow but don't worry, you won't go blind. I'm older than you but I started wearing glasses at age 10 and it went from there. My original subscription started at about -4.00 like yours is now but it changed as I grew. Don't worry though, your prescription isn't bad and if you didn't wear your contacts, you would be straining your eyes and then making it worse, so it is best to wear them and correct your eyesight.|`|gqqNae3Laa	mine was like that.Dont worry my perscription got worse really quickly and then it slowed down and last time it hardly changed.

Good Luck  God Bless|`|Am2WeOdRaa	It sure sounds like anxiety or something related.  Fortunately, you don't have to diagnose the condition.  Just tell your mom you want to see the doc because you're having episodes of rapid heartbeat, that you're generally feeling less able to cope with stress and that you're unable to manage your moods, which jeopardizes your friendships and relationships with family members.  These days docs don't spend very much time with us to get a comprehensive picture of the symptoms.  So you might want to keep a mood journal or chart that you can take with you to the doc so that you can quickly describe your symptoms and patterns    The MoodTracker Chart lets you...    1. Select the time frame you want to view. Month, Quarter, and Year views are available.    2. Track seven mood levels, sleep hours, four anxiety levels, and four irritability levels.     3. Print your chart for your doctor appointments. Color and black and white settings are available.    4. Track your medications displayed behind your mood history. When there is a change in your medication, there is a color change shown on your chart.|`|ogbv6ndCaa	don't worry. like everyone does.|`|jqkK4h6Haa	I suffer from a history of anxiety attacks ( REALLY BAD ONES).

One thing you must be aware is that everybody has an anxiety throughout his/her life.  An anxiety is just one of the basic emotions, like anger.  Learning how to deal with anxiety is just another thing you must go through as you become older.    What you are thinking of is the anxiety DISORDER.  Anxiety disorder is a disease that must be treated by doctors.  The difference between anxiety and anxiety disorder is, one is just an uncomfortable emotion, the other is something one cannot control because it is an illness.    I am guessing you are a teenager?  Likely, you are experiencing a normal reaction to a stress of everyday life.      Go ahead and start a discussion with your parents, but don't assume you have an anxiety disorder.

Or scramble it, pile it into a whole wheat tortilla, put some salsa on top and you've got a breakfast burrito.    A protein shake will also work, if you find one that's sugar-free. A cup of skim milk, a raw egg, 1/4 cup fruit (I like berries) and the protein powder. Just watch out for sugars. Mine's actually sweetened with stevia.

(not like in a crazy amount, but they do like once after you eat one)    -special k cereal. i bought it, not intending to lose weight or anything, but because i love the strawberry kind (i'm obsessed with strawberries) and i think it made me lose some weight. on the side of the box it says "take the special k challenge!" or something, so you could try it.    i've lost like eight pounds within the last couple of months, and i think it might be because i eat special k cereal. i didn't take the challenge thing, but i think over time it slimmed me down.      also, if you want to try an actual diet, try the sacred heart diet.  http://www.idiet4u.com/diets/sacredheart...        i also just read this story on a girl who shed thirty pounds with these two combinations, so you can read up on it if you want     http://www.bellyfatlossdiary.org/ynnswei...|`|9tMDxwHeaa	Eat something high in fiber, like cereal or oatmeal (low in sugar of course). it's quick, easy, and will make you feel fuller longer.|`|M4hQKg7raa	oatmeal|`|vDMASHmLaa	omg u look great    im only 64 pounds but i wish i were your size|`|7Vd3DfYzaa	Your not fat!

I'm almost a B now.|`|629bbf4a270c7f9ae54cec29dad49ad1aa	Very possible.  My weight was once in the 150's, I dropped to 130's and my cup size went down about a half size.  But everyone's different, so it's hard to say if it will or won't happen to you.|`|09AUP79yaa	unfortunately yes they probably will.....i have only lost 17lbs and i went from a big C to a Small C or big B  :'(|`|m9dJH32Taa	Yes.  Breasts consist of a lot of fat along with the breast tissue itself.|`|Y5xfCdukaa	Yes it is rather depressing- all they pretty much are is fat tissue, so when you burn fat...|`|eLKkvaCKaa	It probably depends on your diet and exercises that your doing.  I think it's pretty much unavoidable though.
gkqmrIAGaa	Low white blood cells affects your immune system meaning that you are not as protected as you should be from infections, viruses, etc. Possibly it had something to do with your appendix. If that wasn't the cause then you should be taking vitamins and minerals each day to help build up your white cell count. If it was me I would ask him about that and if your cell count is back to normal. I hope you are recuperating well after your surgery. Please take care!|`|HH56ptnNaa	it means your body isnt going to be able to fight off infections as well as it would with a normal white blood cell count|`|CjMMjtJSaa	The white blood cells are important defenders against infection. A blood count is used to count the number of white cells and tells the doctor which types of white cells are present. There are several different kinds of white cells, each of them specializing in defending the human organism from a particular infection. Its like having an army - navy, marines and air force - in reserve for each type of invasion. Depending on the type of infection, the navy or air force will activate.  We have a resting level of white cells in our blood; here they simply circulate and ensure our body is safe against infection. If you develop an infection, the number of white cells that specialize in that kind of infection will suddenly increase.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Low white blood cell count usually means you have a weakened immune system.  Elevated white blood cell count usually means you have an infection and your body is fighting it.  I assume your appendix was removed because it was infected; so, a low white blood cell count at that time would be unusual.  But you know, all sorts of odd things happen with the human body.  If you are feeling better, don't worry about it.  But if you continue being less healthy than you should be, see a doctor.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	well it means your body is weak and can't fight off infection.|`|t1Zpao9Waa	Low white blood cells is anemia- caused from iron deficiency. Its a comon problem that most people suffer from at some point.    Take iron tablets or eat alot more red meats and foods enriched with iron|`|JvHP2sgMaa	It means your immunity is weaker. White blood cells are commonly lost in cancer patients, though a lo WBC count does not mean you have cancer - only that you could be at higher risk.|`|gxw7vAJQaa	and to add to all that also, be careful not to cut yourself. and you may catch colds easier too.|`|YK1JuIlWaa	you prob will die soon, you must have cancer  good luck

coZ7Fm79aa	what do u mean old? ur bench is respectable anything that's greater than or equal ur weight is respectable  ur squat is okay idk how many reps that is but it's god  clean idrk i dont do those sorry  deadlift yea that's damn respectable  as are ur leg extensions|`|UFwz1FqBaa	Yes, your lifting numbers are respectable,especially because your main sport is just running around which explains your leg strength.If someone laughs just tell them that they should not worry about what you're doing.    Hope I've helped      p.s I am 13 and I bench 110 at the most and I'm almost 14(2 to 3 year difference)|`|0Umym3h9aa	Everyone has different standards. Everyone has their own goals. Don't let someone in life or on yahoo answers tell you otherwise. Your numbers are by no means spectacular by my standards, even if you are just doing it as a hobby. However that shouldn't be for me to tell you. Since everyone is different everyone will develop differently. So here is my suggestion.    Set a goal for yourself. Lets say that by age 17 you want to do 10 reps of 180. Well if you achieve that then it is respectable because you achieved your goal. But if you fell short then you gotta either set lower standards for yourself or train harder. Only you know how far you can push yourself.    I also have a bit of advice for you. While I know it is fun at your age to try and go for a bench max, you REALLY shouldn't. I have been to the gym with many guys who are not serious about weight training. They have hurt themselves badly by going for a one rep max bench. It also doesn't get you anywhere if you just try and do a max. The only way you can get stronger is if you do many reps at a lower weight (which I see you have done). You gotta find the sweet spot where you can do your maximum reps at a maximum weight, for example 20 reps at 100 or 10 reps at 120. This is true for all weight trainers. Take care of your body and you will get stronger faster.     So just as a overview:   -Set goals for yourself and rate yourself based on your goals (poor, respectable, excellent etc)  -Never go for a one-rep max bench, you can seriously hurt yourself (this applies to any lifting with any part of your body)  -Try and find the most efficient way for yourself to train. (10 reps at 110-120 is better then 5 reps at 135)  -You can tell if you found your most efficient "sweet spot" if you are tired after your set of reps, but not to the point where you are coughing up your lungs.   -Always drink plenty of fluids.
xGRh8k2Baa	Did you weigh yourself after you ate, because a lot of times the scale can be misleading directly after eating.  I'm not sure of any of the scientific statistics behind it, but many people get slightly bloated after they eat so extra water weight or whatnot could lead to the scale showing the 3 pounds back.  Other than that I'm not really sure, but it's nothing to worry about.|`|qg8o4gH5aa	some was water weight not true body weight, it happens|`|z6fF9Fsoaa	Just some advice, don't do exercises on the wii. Do some old fashion ones: get out for a run and go to a gym and get on a diet. You'll lose more weight and stay healthier and also gain some muscle.|`|PrS7So5Yaa	Weight fluctuations are normal. You didn't actually lose 5 lbs of fat in one week. A lot of it (probably the 3 you "gained back") was water.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	It's normal for your weight to fluctuate a few pounds either way. It's most likely water weight, not fat so don't get so upset.|`|93CVX6Jwaa	you cant expect to get fit using wii fit, go to a gym or go running|`|kNscpF4Faa	What you weigh in the morning  will be one thing, Weigh at noon it will be different and before bed different again.Weight fluctuates all thru the day and depends on how much you ate or drank and urine and fecal outputs for the day|`|ay0FEQaiaa	most likely it is muscle weight so don't worry. and that's a good thing because muscle burns fat all day constantly. dont worry about getting a little bit of muscle either because since you are a girl you will not get bulky.|`|7qxcQDsbaa	It helps to measure you weight at the same time of day, preferably in the morning.    You won't have factors like recent food ingestion or waste elimination to give you the wrong idea of weight change.    Water intake also might affect the readings (don't stop drinking water!).    This being said, your body weight is not as important as the quality of your heart (meaning both pumping ability to keep you alive/active as well as a good person).|`|KPDjwiKgaa	it's probably just water weight, or maybe you're PMSing.  do not listen to what the scales tell you, also you could have gained muscle from working out!|`|8j7FCEOraa	OH MY GOD 3 POUNDS!    You do know that the body's weight fluctuates naturally around 2-3 pounds during the day, right?|`|KjzsYV9uaa	Unless you ate around 17000 calories that day then that isn't fat that you gained, it's most likely water or food that is still in your stomach. There are about 3500 calories to a pound of fat so there is no way that you could have gained that much.    To get accurate measures weigh yourself in the morning so that there isn't food that is still digesting|`|hp35U4xiaa	idk have you gone to the bathroom lately? have you been drinking a lot today? idk but i bet when you wake up in the morning all the extra pounds will be gone|`|xqOWI8VUaa	there ur problem. Wii fit. Wut a sad excuse for an exercise machine. Ppl who use that to get fit really just need to give up. Slump bak on the cough, eat plently of junk food and just give up. Epic fail @ life.|`|AEAxZEveaa	what you lost was water. the scale can't differentiate between water weight and weight from fat. Plus, you're gaining muscle too. Just keep exercising and you'll burn fat.
DRSU2pz4aa	Everybody progresses at different speeds. Age can factor into it, in addition to general overall health.    If it's not something you're doing extremely frequently, I'd say that's alright improvement. If you see any results, that's what matters.    Good luck with it. Hope this helped some.

bb24aa09ca7e3f59fb7e5b06be37c61daa	A cancer cell can, under ideal conditions, live infinitely.     It derives nutrition from the host and does not die or have regular cycles like normal cells, which is why it is a cancer cell.     Experiments conducted have shown that if a cancer cell is given proper nutrition, it could live for an indefinite amount of time.

I got this off of webMD:    Symptoms of iron poisoning usually become evident within 6 hours after an excessive amount of iron is swallowed.        * Iron corrodes your intestinal lining and is a direct irritant to the stomach.        * People with iron poisoning can have the following symptoms:        * Severe vomiting        * Diarrhea        * Abdominal pain        * Dehydration and lethargy if not treated adequately        * A childs vomit or stool may be bloody.        * Often, after supportive care, the gastrointestinal symptoms appear to improve 6-24 hours after their onset.        * If profound poisoning is inadequately treated, shock and death can occur.        * The amount of iron ingested may give a clue to potential toxicity. The therapeutic dose for iron deficiency anemia is 3-6 mg/kg/day. Toxic effects begin to occur at doses above 10-20 mg/kg of elemental iron. Ingestions of more than 50 mg/kg of elemental iron are associated with severe toxicity.        * A 325-mg tablet of ferrous sulfate has 65 mg (20%) of elemental iron        * A 325-mg tablet of ferrous gluconate has 39 mg (12%) of elemental iron        * A 325-mg tablet of ferrous fumarate has 107.25 mg (33%) of elemental iron    You need to contact a doctor ASAP!|`|by94s63Zaa	wow i think so.  you shouldn't take that many vitamins in a day.

7CmkRkEMaa	No weights. Hatha yoga as taught in B.K.S. Iyengar books is best. If you learn static stretch, you will lose weight and get in top form. The key is stop dynamic stretching (Pilates, weights, aerobics, etc.) that causes the shortening of muscles and not expansion or lengthening. Also, running is ironically (it is dynamic, but doing a short static session afterward balances it - it is hard not to accept running insofar as it is such a perfect full body exercise) recommended by Iyengar. Remember. Diet is the key as well. Incorporate the green smoothies at least, if you cannot go one hundred percent raw.

ToILKl6waa	Before heading to bed each night, write down everything on a paper that you need to remember the next morning. Also, put a few of your strengths and good features down to remind yourself of your extraordinary well being. Put the paper where you can see it. Then when you wake up, look at the paper. Wake yourself up with some music as you get ready for the day, and a good breakfast. Realize that sleep is only comforting the moment before you fall asleep. The rest you cannot feel, and when you wake up you're exhausted! So be awake more and enjoy the life you were blessed with. When you go to sleep, enjoy sleeping. When you're awake, enjoy being awake - do not bring sleep to your memory until later on at home. Throughout the day, carry around the list. And if you have successfully followed through with your goals, reward yourself at the end of the day. Pretty soon you'll want to attain the goals so much that you'll awaken with no problem. Remember - you are always in control. If you want to be awake and motivated, you can BE awake and motivated.|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	Well, as a morning person myself the key is to have the most annoying alarm and set about three alarms, fifteen minutes apart from each other. Also, going to sleep late doesn't help. If you need help getting to bed try listening to Kenny G's Christmas album called "the Miracles". Also, use this while trying to complete your goals. REMEMBER the most work I ever get done is always before 6 am.
Cmer6UJPaa	Yeah, you have to go the the ER right now....those are classic symptoms of a potential concussion. You really need to go because they need to determine how much your brain has swollen against the walls of your skull. If the pressure there is too great you can have permanent brain damage if they don't release it. Please go to the ER to get it looked at    I'm DEAD SERIOUS about this, you're not going to get another chance if it gets worse, get your butt to the ER right now!|`|wziUVyVoaa	You need to go to your parents immediately. None of those symptoms are normal for just a bumped head. You most likely have a concussion and they can be fatal if ignored. If there was a crack, then there's a possibility of internal bleeding, which can also be fatal. That's all you can do. Taking pain killers and hiding it from your parents is the worst thing possible. You won't be a sissy for getting treated. I'll say it again for emphasis, these symptoms are NOT normal! You're not a sissy and you're not going to seem like one. Look at it this way, if you DON'T go, think of all the horrible things that could happen. Help yourself get over your pride and get to the emergency room now!|`|YPspBqJ7aa	1st of all if you are reading this and you havent gone to the doctor STOP NOW go ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... gET BETTER SOON!|`|RvSHQtrXaa	It is your health and your feelings do not let no one deter you from going to the doctor or inform your parents.    You might need a CAT scan of your brain.  CAT means computerized axial tomography scan.  This scan can reveal any pathology of the brain.  If you did a skull x-ray, it will only reveal the vault fracture or the skull.  To look more intensively in the brain with axial slices shown on a computer the doctor can diagnose a haematoma or ruptured ventricles that supply blood and oxygen to the brain.    A concussion is a kind of haemorrhage as I was mentioning above.  First before the referral to a radiologist the doctor can use a pen light and look in your eyes to detect the concussion.  Please something does not sound right as your behaviour has been change somewhat.  Check your head out.|`|bmL3W289aa	Symptoms like this that happen after hitting your head could be very serious! That does absolutely NOT make you a sissy to get help. Tell your parents and go to the Emergency Room immediately.
5fdgfNCRaa	Yes! This is normal! Plan B is an emergency contraceptive aka a really high dose of normal birth control. When I first started birth control pills about 2 yrs ago, the first week I was STARVING. I'd eat and then an hour or 2 later I'd be STARVING AGAIN! My breasts didn't get sore, but some people have different effects than others.     I have no doubt that what you're experiencing is based solely on the pill you took. To feel that hungry and have sore breasts would suggest (if you WERE pregnant) that you'd at least be several weeks along. It's only been a week so in the slight chance that you DID get pregnant on that day, you wouldn't be feeling any symptoms quite yet because the embryo takes a few days before it implants itself onto the wall of ur uterus. The fact that your body is sending you these signals is GOOD! Since it's way too early for you to feel these things from pregnancy, that means you're feeling them from use of the pill aka it's working and it made ur uterus un-impantable (your body secretes a mucus so implantation isn't possible)!    You're all good!  Relax and don't lose a wink of sleep! :)|`|HH56ptnNaa	the hormones might be effecting you in that way|`|yqWlt0Q7aa	you might be pregnant, remember the after pill doesn't always work.     you could be the lucky one|`|37433c6ac47d0b92b72607c07f65afc1aa	Be on the safe side and get a PG test, although to soon for most of the hormones to kick in, but worth a check.|`|PVe7Vb12aa	yes it is really normal, if u never used birthcontrol u might wanna get on it now, the plan b is to be taken really if women used birthcontrol already and have a "mishap" or  w/e u wanna call it ,if  the sore ness doesnt leave in a week u have to consult a doctor beacuse taken a pill without consulting a doctor can lead to other things in ur body, thats why u have to see a doctor first before u start taking birth control, ever women is different and plan b has a lot of "chemicals" that are strong and most women need lower dosages, so see a doctor when u can|`|qIaoqgboaa	week before period?|`|ALIxomXUaa	when is your period?|`|t1Zpao9Waa	This is normal - that tablet f**ks with your hormones and can make you pretty sick.    If this doesnt go away see a doctor|`|qZBpbsfzaa	Your body may just be reacting to the hormones in the pills, but if you're not feeling better within a day or two, I would go visit your doctor.|`|tj6tsPgaaa	Well, I, myself, have asked the clinic about this pill and I got a pregnancy pill shot.  Plan B is a really affective pill, and works for like, 1 out of 100 woman. Maybe, you could be worried about it and your brain is telling yourself these things. Like your psyching yourself out. Or it could also be your period, which would be a really good sign at this time.   But, you could be one of the 1 out of 100 women, so if you still have these symptoms in a couple of weeks but they become worse, then I would go to the doctors. If your under age and can't have your parents know, go to the nearest clinic and sign yourself in, they won't tell your parents or anyone, they'll check you, and if you are pregnant then you can get an abortion there, if you believe in those. That's the best I could think of.|`|osoTq2dcaa	you might be over thinking the situation but if you were pregnant you wouldnt have symptoms till way later then a week after ... it might just be a side effect of the plan B pill considering your putting a lot of hormones into your body at once and its not use to that
bMZlAqZPaa	Eating breakfast jump-starts your metabolism for the day.  It's an initial kickoff point for your body for the day.  Coming from a dancer, a banana and glass of green sounds a little sparse if you don't eat anything else until lunch.  If you can get in a healthy snack between breakfast and lunch then the banana and green tea is a good choice.  If you don't have time to eat anything else between breakfast and lunch I would recommend adding a piece of toast with peanut butter and honey (an awesome combination), an apple, or--if you're so inclined--a Slimfast in place of the banana.|`|Qt1bxJzjaa	Yes it is good for you but if you are not looking for eating much than you should consider eating cereal like Special K or maybe just anything to fill you up without being so bloated or fell sick.|`|iefwVbQbaa	they say banana is very good for breakfast then drink water,,but you can eat a slice of bread,,it won't make your stomach bloat up..|`|dCF1UBUsaa	you need protein, complex carbs, healthy fats, and some dairy is a good idea. i usually have 2 packets of high fiber oatmeal, 1/2 cup fresh fruit, 1 whole egg, 4 egg whites. takes like 5 minutes to make and 5 to eat. really good and energizes me. because you probably need less calories than i do, i'd suggest a packet of high fiber instant oatmeal, 1/2 cup fresh fruit, and 1 whole egg, 1 egg white.    another good breakfast is 1 orange, 1 slice whole grain toast with 1tbsp natural peanut butter, and 8oz. skim milk.     both are quick, healthy, and good.|`|QxbOXDFRaa	until your full, breakfast is the only meal if you are on a diet that you should not cut back on.

I would go for eating some nuts and fruit, it'll be healthy and it'll give you protein to last you until lunch.|`|DP7iyG4Laa	How bout grab a quick hash brown from McDonalds across the street?  You need some carbs- banana and green tea are healthy but it doesn'n provide enough energy for a normal teenager. You should eat some bread- or anything fried(not to oily cuz I bet ur crazy about ur weight too). So cereal is fine- it makes you really full but I don't really like the taste of it. Same goes for oatmeal.    Oh, how bout some cookies and a muffin? Pancakes are awesome too!        Happy breakfastin! =))|`|AA11830517	my god, your such a fat cow|`|RmhKCM3Eaa	yea i have a hard time with breakfast sometimes too cause i just dont have enough time! so sometimes i just drink a glass of oj and eat some kind of fruit or toast. you dont really need a whole lot just enough to get your brain started in the morning!|`|qg8o4gH5aa	well something is better then nothing. breakfast is my biggest meal, i pack around 800 calories which lasts me til a snack then dinner. so depends on what u need to get through your day or next meal...|`|inzQ7m1iaa	u should eat a small bowl of cereal a piece of fruit and a piece of toast and maybe a glass of juice. that would be a well rounded breakfast thats quick and inexpensive.|`|ThdM0dNXaa	Eating breakfast is the most important meal of your day.  I am sure you've heard that before.  I've been told by my nutritionist to try and get protein heavily into your breakfast.  He told me you should try to get half of your daily protein intake/requirements with your breakfast.  Hope that helps a little.  Good luck!!
981df12e3af5a0a9a808ef0ad9c7d9cbaa	counting calories and exercising!  its the most logical healthy diet, and its basically free!|`|PJzd8iJaaa	the diet i am on now.. no diet, i eat healthy but i dont consider it a diet..|`|8YhITQ7laa	eating right and exercising works the best. Diets dont usually work because you prevent yourself from having things you want like cake and chocolate. Eating in moderation seems to work the best
Df8wTpEKaa	I have this problem too. :) I have a little extra weight in my stomach and sides and I want to work it off but I don't want to lose the size of my booty. :) There are certain leg exercises you can do to make your butt firmer, and there's also certain stomach exercises that won't make you lose your butt. I know a lot of people don't like this idea, but try belly-dancing.  Even if you're not good at it....when I first started, I was horrible. I wanted to lose stomach weight. But I kept watching Shakira, and soon I got the hang of it and I actually lost a bit of belly fat, believe it or not. And I didn't lose my butt size! It's fun to do and it works. But if that's not your thing, go to a gym and maybe ask the people who work there for suggestions. I'm no professional, I just have personal experience!! :)     And about the dieting, I've tried that so many times but I always give in to junk foods. Ha ha. No, I eat like a pig, but I manage to maintain a good weight by mainly dancing a lot. I used to stink at dancing but whether you stink or not, if you do it privately in your room in front of the mirror, no one can see you. Ha ha. I hope this helps.|`|VkXv4RInaa	yes, but it will probably still look very appetizing because even though it will be slightly smaller, the rest of you will too - so the proportion will hopefully stay the same.      keep on keepin those jeans filled.|`|xpJcnM88aa	Yes, indeed.  When you loose weight, partial area of your body will shrink.      When I loose weight from running, sit-ups, stair-running, and diet, my boobs gets smaller & my butt.  I find stretch marks on partial areas of my body.  But it wouldn't matter much...|`|IopM61XAaa	Yes it will your going to lose fat in your bottom, but if you do some strength exercising you can increase the size of your muscles in your bottom so you'll have a firmer tush and probably the same size
yDJiiqcsaa	It's somewhat like when a person has a sickness (flu, meningitis etc) that includes a fever - the fever causes disturbed thinking and it seems "logical" to the person to run outside in their pajamas or something else that sounds crazy.   Mental problems, stress, or depression can alter thought processes in that way and it may make suicide seem "logical" to their disturbed thought processes.|`|ni06WWg4aa	It is a very selfish act|`|pnL5WTXMaa	yeah, suicide is a bummer. it's like leaving before the end of the movie. even if it's a bad movie, just stick around to see how it ends. but some people don't wait and miss out.|`|OiLNogtEaa	Somebody told me that when someone commits suicide, they are not thinking rationally because they are preparing to face the end and that is a HUGE decision that cannot be made while thinking rationally. It is actually a fact that they are being irrational|`|c0342d26192961a8e86c337c0610b25aaa	NO. People that Commit suicide are So Angry with themselves that they Kill themselves, A good Definition of Depression is " ANGER TURNED INWARD". When someone gets Enraged with Themselves Suicide is almost inevitable.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I think that when you are young you think that things are so bad and that when bad things happen that it's the end of the world. Young people are irrational. They are spontaneous and don't think things through. They don't think about how suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems. People feel guilty when a love one commits suicide because they feel like the should have done something more to help this person.|`|MeGazyy7aa	I'm suicidal. People don't understand it (they don't know that I am, they just don't understand how sad someone can be). But, it's all in you head, and I don't mean its imaginary, it's what is always going on with your life, in your head. It's the way you see things. The way you read things.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Have you really thought about the mid part of your question?    Do you realise that it unlikely that you will ever meet someone who has committed suicide?  As a rule they are no longer able to socialise.     See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlObZqhUW...|`|V7D1DUizaa	A lot of people do feel a lot of stress that they don't show. Some people can spend the whole day with friends, laughing and having a great time, but then they go home and feel like those friends were just being nice and nobody really cares about them. I know a lot of people that seem really happy but have considered suicide. It's never the answer though. When life gets tough, you gotta get tougher. :)      We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed (2 Corinthians 4: 8-9)    My brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of any kind, consider it nothing but joy, because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance; and let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing. If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God, who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly, and it will be given you. But ask in faith, never doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind; for the doubter, being double-minded and unstable in every way, must not expect to receive anything from the Lord. (James 1: 2-8)    You who have made me see many troubles and calamities   Will revive me again;  From the depths of the earth    You will bring me up again.  (Psalm 71:20)      For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope. (Jeremiah 29:20)|`|AA12351337	Some might have a good reason.  Their really isn't a good reason for killing yourself.  But some do.   A lot of times, people kill themselves because of relationship issues.  That is never a good reason, no matter what.  There are over 7 billion people on earth, and a few in space.  So no one should ever feel they should kill themselves over one person.  Some might have what most would consider a good reason.  Financial reasons.  They file bankruptcy and are still screwed.  Or other reasons.  Homeless, loss of job, ect.  No one should kill themselves, bottom line.  I do want to point out... you can't meet someone who has committed suicide.  They're kind of, dead.  Just wanted to clarify.
uxMxWxvuaa	try omg girl deodorants sweat protection|`|vR6AwIppaa	i had the same problem. notice i said "had" which is past tense hehe :D  use certain dri (the roll-on kind) i swear to god it worked miracles. buy the deodorant and antiperspirant (two different packages) and follow the directions exactly. that stuff is life-saving. listen to me.      ~LILY HAS SPOKEN~|`|913f6ba74f709bc6ad9e752a2ceb427baa	Hi - sorry, not a girl but have had serious sweating issues all my life - and I'm 36 years old.  Ive seen countless doctors and tried various treatments.    There is no good explanation to it.  Some people see an improvement after pueberty.      Me?  Not so much.  I had to wear baggy clothes and lucky I live in a cool climate where layers are always on order.    There is a surgery which can help - and I actually had it done.  There is a nerve which can be cut and it stops the sweating to hands, under-arms and face area.  I am really happy with the results, however, increased sweating results in the mid section and lower-back but not as bad.     Good luck - it's a sucky thing to have.  Try to eliminate caffeine and sugar from your diet and don't under or over sleep.    Just so you know -- this has not slowed me down.  Yes, it's bee embarrassing at times, but it hasn't slowed me down and I have a beautiful wife, family and a great career and have property and traveled the world.      It will be OK    ps- deodorants/anti persperants  don't work - don't put that crap on your skin - which is absorbed into the body and drink LOTS of water to keep your body cool
52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Leave your body the way it was meant to be.
48Yf8tpsaa	Lots of exercise.... and eat healthy food. Try to exercise large muscle groups... these burn the most fat... squats and lunges... rowing, bike riding, lift some weights... you wont build big muscles like a guy (well not without steriods) .. but you will lean up.     I'm addicted to exercise... and sex. There could be worse addictions for a guy like me but I'm dealing with it best I can, you know. Yep, I'm a creepy old guy.. a product of my environment!! Here's another star!|`|CciXZNYraa	You can't really lose weight in only some certain areas.. but you can tone up by eating right and exercising.    here are a few tips;    Don't eat late at night.   Eating late at night can cause you to store more fat in your waist and stomach. Stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed. If you need a snack, eat something healthy like a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts (unsalted).   Eat often, but in small portions. The less your body peaks and falls on the blood sugar scale, the less likely it will be to overeat and/or store unwanted fat. Ideally, cut calories, but dont starve yourself. If you eat the right foods and eat often enough, you wont find yourself eating huge portions and overeating in general.  Eat fats like fish oil, sunflower oil, flax seed oil. Also whole grains, legumes, and vegetables and limiting meats. Ease up on the salt and gassy foods that cause you to bloat.      You can also try these exercises:    Belly rolls strengthen your vertical abdominal muscles. Sit with your legs bent, with feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground and stop for a moment. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times.   In the same position, exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground and momentarily stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times.     Tummy curls work on your horizontal abdominal muscles. Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle to the floor with your feet raised slightly higher than your knees. Breathe out, lifting your butt and rolling back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone and stop. Try not to let your bottom touch the ground. Repeat 20 times.     Cross crunches are hard work but they're miracle workers at cinching waists. You will need a liter bottle filled with water for this one. Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. With your left hand cradling your head, hold the water bottle in your right hand. Lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. Pulse 20 times and then switch sides and repeat.     Tailbone lifts work your lower abdomen and can help reduce a belly pouch. Lay on your back, with your arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. While breathing out, lift your tailbone then slowly lower as you inhale. To get maximum effect from this, don't let your bum just drop, you want to resist on the way down. Repeat 30 times.     This is a favorite of mine as inverted crunches work your lower back which improves posture and strength. Lie on your belly with your arms in front of you as though you are flying like Superman. Exhale, lifting your right arm and left leg as high as you can. As you inhale, lower slowly. Switch, lifting your left arm and right leg. Repeat 20 times.   In the same position, lift both arms and legs twenty times.    Burn your belly fat by doing sit and reach exercise.   Running and dancing early in the morning.   Simple stretching and jumping when you wake up in the morning.|`|qg8o4gH5aa	By moving more and eating less!|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	When you lose weight you lose it all over - so it will go off your boobs and stomach equally.
yQhz52hfaa	It's good to eat the Lean Cuisine meals for lunch at least.  The points are on the box and no calculating.  There are several that are pretty good.  Grilled chicken ,salad, sandwiches aren't really too bad either.  Most "average" sandwiches end up being around 5 points.  I find it best to save up most of my points for supper and eat less during the day.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Fruit and vegetables are low point foods.  They help to fill you up and are low in calories.

What if this happened to you while you were driving?!?  If this was happening to me every hour, I'd go to the hospital!!!  Did your doctor say it was ok to take all three medicines together?  If you haven't been given a professional's ok - I would maybe try and just stick to one... the Mucinex OR the ibu until you have this figured out.  I'm not in the medical field, but taking multiple drugs can react very badly when you take the wrong combo.    Updated... I see that you wrote that the doc said it was ok to take all those meds.  Maybe your body is reacting badly to it or something else is wrong.  I hope you get yourself back to the doctor soon.

C2M2StR1aa	You can't spot reduce fat.  You have to reduce overall body fat and often the fat around the middle is the last to release.  So for your abs to show you have to have a very low percentage of body fat.     I also tell my clients to eat smaller meals more times (5-6) per day. When a body is starved it will store fat. When it believes that times are good (when it's being feed good nutrition often) it will release fat.     I have written a page focusing on a 3 pronged approach dealing with Detoxing, Nutrition and Exercise (especially body weight exercises, which you can do in your home).     www.diet-and-exercise-for-health.com/b...

Om9CFRpsaa	Yes, drinking tons of water will increase weight loss. 1) Most of your body is made-up of water. In order to function properly, your body needs water. You will eliminate more waste and toxins, if you drink more water. Water does not flush out food, per se, but it does help your body more efficiently process food. Therefore, you will be less bloated and metabolize food quicker if you drink more water.  Also, water gives you energize to exercise more.  2) Water fills you up. Many people confuse dehydration with hunger. Try drinking two 8 oz. glasses of water or caffeine-free tea when you feel hungry. Wait 20 minutes. Then see if you are still hungry. You will either eat less or you may realize that you were dehydrated and not hungry.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	In many cases it will cause weight loss. Not because it flushes food out but because you should feel less hungry. Your system senses the water weight as being full.|`|2WjcBrn1aa	No, but it makes you less hungry. You are less likely to eat a big meal after just drinking a bunch of water. And water doesn't exactly have a ton of calories.|`|briRpzL1aa	No, but it will encourage you to pee allot...|`|9XmJPjXvaa	yes. check this article "Lose Weight Hydrating" in    http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com|`|oQq1rqDVaa	Not necessarily but drinking water will keep you energised and give you mental clarity.  You could drink about 8 glasses per day.|`|KjxtziGYaa	No, it doesn't flush the food out (exactly) but it is absolutely necessary for weight loss and health. Your body will actually hold fluids inside if you don't drink enough water so drink 8 glasses a day and you should be fine.|`|0BkVs1X1aa	it does make you urinate a lot which means it gets rid of more waste in your body. it wouldn't flush all the waste in your system but drinking more water is good right now because of the cold climate.

AA10250756	Enjoy is right. Planned Parenthood will give you birth control pills and charge only what you can afford. You can go without an adult. If there is not a PP nearby, tell your father that you are getting sick when you get your period and missing class and you want to have seasonique, so you only get your period once every three months and don't miss so many classes. .

bMZlAqZPaa	You need to feel comfortable in your body.  A little known tidbit:  The more muscle you have, the more fat your body will burn.  I'm a dancer and I've had that little "STOP EATING SO YOU'LL BE SKINNY!" voice screaming in the back of my head for the past 9 years.  After 7 of those 9 years I finally realized that my body is the only thing I am going to own for the rest of my life;  I can go against my body type and make it into something it's not meant to be, or I can lean to love the fact that it's healthy.    If you're looking to burn off some excess fat you need to target your workouts toward the "fat burning" stage, which means less intense, yet longer, workout sessions.  I've added a reference:  It's not the most trustworthy information, but--on short notice--it has a decent calculation to determine where your heart rate should be during the "fat burning" stage of exercise.|`|hxJouZgTaa	if you are a guy don't be skinny muscular guys are hot..if you are a girl then idk|`|0KTVNTYYaa	stop lifting waits|`|FcovHfZcaa	let go of the weights and start eating veggies u wont be as toned but u would be thinner lass muscular|`|WCAhhAFiaa	stop doing heavy waits.. less pounds and more reps.. or just stop for a while and eat well so no fat builds on you.. do more cardio than weights.|`|6Apou72oaa	Muscle is good.

It's only when these feelings and thoughts "take over" a person it becomes a problem. When you get these feelings, try to think of places or things that make you feel relaxed and happy.

Remember, suicide is NEVER the answer.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	If you will spend a few days here reading the "Mental health" section questions - you'll find that your situation is very common. Why ? Probably because at your age your body is in turmoil trying to release and regulate a lot of new hormones.  It is logical that your body will take many months or years to gain an equilibrium in it's cycles of hormones.  Doesn't that make sense when considering that relatively few pre-pubescent kids have depression but once puberty hits it seems the "rule rather than the exception" ?  You're physically operating as an adult woman (or preparing to) and mood swings go with hormonal changes. Welcome to the "not always so nice world" of adult women.|`|E2BeVNkIaa	Oh my goodness!

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	What you're saying, it doesn't really sound like autism.  But to answer your question, yes, people can live their entire lives on the Autism Spectrum Disorder and never know it.      Autism covers such a wide range of symptoms.  Some people may have severe autism and not be able to join the "normal" society with jobs, etc.  Others have very mild Autism and it mainly harms social relationships and might provide some sensory problems, but they are very highly functioning.    There is a specific medical diagnosis to go along with it.  It will really take a doctor who specializes in this field to diagnose it, but you can get an idea of what it takes.      The following information is from webmd.com   It talks about signs to look for in children, but many of these carry over to adults:        *  Difficulty with verbal communication, including problems using and understanding language.      * Inability to participate in a conversation, even when the child has the ability to speak.      * Difficulty with non-verbal communication, such as gestures and facial expressions.      * Difficulty with social interaction, including relating to people and to his or her surroundings.      * Inability to make friends and preferring to play alone.      * Unusual ways of playing with toys and other objects, such as only lining them up a certain way.      * Lack of imagination.      * Difficulty adjusting to changes in routine or familiar surroundings, or an unreasonable insistence on following routines in detail.      * Repetitive body movements, or patterns of behavior, such as hand flapping, spinning and head banging.      * Preoccupation with unusual objects or parts of objects.    People with a form of autism, called savantism, have exceptional skills in specific areas such as music, art, and numbers. People with savantism are able to perform these skills without lessons or practice.    ________    I had a friend diagnosed with Autism in his 30s.  It was Asperger's Syndrome, which is considered mild on the Autism spectrum.  His diagnosis made perfect sense because he was always socially awkward.  But man...he could do ANYTHING on a computer.|`|tAcWksQYaa	Yes. Highly possible. It sounds like her case is a less agressive case.     If you were wondering... Most autistic children are born when a highly inteligent person (nerd) and a slower person are the parents. The slower person (in most autistic children cases) usually has a mild case of autism that was never found out about.
iAv9P3HTaa	You have been loosing a lot of weight.  You have willpower obviously so I believe you can get toned.  However serious six packs starts under 10% body fat.  Running is cool but you burning fat with that as well.  Do these exercises at least 5 days a week at least 15 min a day in two months you will be there.  Eat healthy as well.  Exercises:    here are the best exercises for hard core abs:    Side Bends    * Holding a dumbbell in you right hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.  * Place your left hand behind your head and slowly bend sideways to your right lowering the dumbbell down to your knee.  * Return to an upright position and repeat for the desired number of reps.    Medicine Ball Sit Ups    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (choose a 5 pound ball to begin) to your chest and have a partner stand at your feet (not on them).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * As you curl up throw the ball to your partner. Hold the crunch as your partner catches the ball and throws it back to you.  * Catch the ball and slowly return to the start position.  * Tip: Don't sit right the way up as you wait for the return pass. Your shoulders should be no more than 6 inches off the floor.    Weighted Curls with Medicine Ball    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (or weight plate) to your chest (start with 5 pounds).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * Curl up just enough to lift both your shoulders off the floor a few inches.  * Hold for a count of 2 and return to the start position.    Cable Crunch    * This exercise requires a triceps pushdown machine with a rope attachment.  * Knee down in font of the machine holding the rope just above your head.  * Slowly crunch down to your right knee and hold for 2 seconds as you breathe out.  * Return to the start position slowly and repeat to the left knee.    Abdominal Exercise Guidelines  Perform several (3-5) abdominal exercises 3-5 times a week. Start with exercises and repetitions that are comfortable for your fitness level and as you improve increase the number of repetitions. You do not need to do all the exercises; simply select those that work well for you and vary your routine over the months.

You need to get your body fat lower than 14.    2. Yeah running, jogging or swimming helps with burning off your body fat. When you are doing such exercises, the duration should no less than 30 minutes.    3. Yeah, and remember to eat lots of things that have high protein, and no more fatty food.    4. Yep, as long as you keep doing workouts every other day. Doing crunches/ sit-ups with weights helps a lot, too.    Hope I helped here.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	It is genetic in some cases, but that other answerer is right - researchers are looking into other possible causes. But in any case, it is a combo of genetics and environment. A history of severe trauma as a child greatly increases your chance of getting any serious mental disorder, and also makes the disorder more severe and more resistent to treatment.  Apperantly, severe stress as a child can turn OFF genes that previously were turned ON, so they no longer code for certain proteins in the brain, and then your brain doesn't work right, and these genetic problems can actually be passed on to your kids. This is totally new genetics research - i think it is called epigenetics, and was not believed this could happen even 5 years ago, or so.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I believe it is genetic.

Go to calorieking.com and you can figure the calories out for anything that you eat!  Good luck!
2rXETYrFaa	Ive had one removed from my breast also,and several other places ,mostly pain free maybe a little discomfort for a day. Like others have said you will have a patch of lighter skin,thats all.Ive also had skin cancer removed from my face twice...lol...mostly pain free and little scarring...the worst was hearing them cut into the side of my nose...yukk,i wll never forget that sound. But really,dont worry,the actual procedure is always worse in our minds...i know,ive spent time worrying for nothing.Good luck and relax.|`|VDXKqoejaa	I had a mole removed a few years ago. The anesthetic injections were barely noticeable, and the procedure itself was not painful in the least. The greatest inconveniences was a little soreness and stiffness lasting a few days afterwards, and some rather severe itching lasting several weeks.<br>  <br>  You will likely need to apply a disinfectant daily, something your dermatologist will discuss with you. You may also want to talk to him about itching medications and methods of application that will not interfere with the healing tissue.<br>  <br>  The scar is still present, but it was a large mole in the small of my back; so yours may not be so acute. If it is on your chest, you may or may not be able to wear a bra for a time, so plan your social schedule accordingly.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and don't worry!|`|367d9eb3662fb7b349086406ca5c48c7aa	They use a local anesthetic, so you will not feel any pain.  As for scaring, that depends on how the size, location, your skin type and how old you are.  If you're young and have a darker complexion and the mole is on the smaller side, in a year, or so, you probably won't remember that you even had a mole.|`|7KHMepStaa	I usually just get a shot in that area that numbs the whole thing.  Then, from there you don't feel anything that they are doing.  The shot isn't very comfortable, and it kind of depends on where it is!  I would not say it is excruciating.  The scar really depends on how much area they have to remove and how deep they have to go.  Make sure you really follow their instructions- which is usually putting an ointment on it often.  My scars are noticeable, but a year or so later it's just a lighter/whiter area on my skin. I suppose it would depend on your skin tone as well as people of color scar differently.|`|xVwCGfQ0aa	My Dr removed mine while I watched. He gave me a local and then used what looked like a hole puncher to cut around the mole all at once. Then he pulled it out with a tweezer, it had like a 6" root! He snipped it off and sent it to a lab. I've had three done and only one left a permanat scar, the others faded over 6 months-a year.<br>  It hurt like a burn from a curling iron for 3 days or so.|`|WF4Z10Paaa	no it does not hurt as they give u a local and maybe 1 stitch to close it and the scaring should not be that bad at all|`|XTDeAfTqaa	You won't feel a thing. I had a mole frozen off my face but it grew back.<br>  The Dermatologist used two shots of a local anesthetic to numb it and then burned it off. I never felt a thing and it left no scar at all.<br>  I also had a cyst removed from my back. it was about the size of a gumball. It had to be cut with scissors and I never felt a thing.<br>  Don't worry. Your boob will be fine.|`|4YnoykD2aa	The area is frozen first, and that's the worst part. The pain is near non-existent. I scar easily, so no. You may be different. You'll be fine. :)|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	I'm guessing you're having it done at the GP surgery.  They will inject a small amount of local anaesthetic which will sting a bit but isn't too bad.  After that when the area is numbed they will cut away the mole and depending on the size of the mole you may need a couple of stiches.  If you need stiches you will need them removed in about a week.  Your scar should heal over within a couple of weeks and should eventually be barely noticeable.  It's nothing to be worried about.  If you're so worried why are you getting it removed?|`|1SKN7SoDaa	My neighbour got that op done; because it was hurting her so badly.<br>  I've had 9 surgeries before, so I'm well use to it.<br>  Anywayz, according to my neighbour, the pain is quite copable, but it does take about a week for the uncomfort to ease, and the scar does heal perfectly.<br>  Good luck, and hope all goes well. ;)|`|BRh1uAMNaa	I had mine done via local, which after that kicked in, I didn't feel a thing.<br>  The worst part was that it really itched while it was healing. Mind was on my back, so I can't tell you how it scared.|`|Og3vKQeWaa	do not worry, the procedure is painless, the scar depends on your skin type!
1LPvMbXAaa	I assume you are talking about two implants in the upper jaw and two in the lower to hold your dentures in place (mini implants are not strong enough for crowns and bridges), so a total of four implants. <br>  <br>  I don't know anybody in Hungary offering mini implants, but four standard implants will run in the area of EUR 2600-3600 in total. Probably the savings will more than pay for your travel and stay.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	My dentist quoted me ￡3000 to fill a single space where a tooth had crumbled.
3bsIGHE4aa	You have lymph nodes in your neck.  Lymph nodes are like "stations" for your immune system, which is in overdrive when you're sick.  That's why the glands swell.  As long as it goes away with your cold, it's nothing to worry about, your body is supposed to do that.  If the swelling won't go away though, you need to go to the doctor to make sure you don't have anything out of the ordinary going on.|`|5G5uStzMaa	Its probebly the glands in your neck swelling up.<br>  Its where all the cells are i think, that help you get better.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctor if you are worried.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Inflamed adenoids.|`|loOquoT2aa	Its most probably a swollen gland.<br>  Some people get it worse than others... its nothing to worry about if this is the case its just like if you get a bang on the head and it swells.<br>  Go to see your dp next time your ill so they can check it out to be on the safe side.<br>  Dont worry about it it will be fine<br>  <br>  Lisa x|`|FcyMASukaa	This used to happen to me when I got colds as well.

wNXq55tWaa	i HATE pads it feels nasty as can be but the good thing about them as opposed to tampons is that you know you wont leak through you panties and it won't stain.|`|uNMVTsg7aa	Tampons. They are much cleaner :)  Pads make me feels like im walking around in a wet diaper all day.|`|2d8DfrSZaa	ummmm   tampons work the best for me|`|Oh2wVMkyaa	tampons are dangerous and can make you go to hospital if you use them the wrong way. i use pads because you know when go change them when they get full.|`|lhbEY5eJaa	never tried tampons  and am kinda worried to try them  it makes me nervous  but pads are fine  i only like always ultra thin with wings because they are awsome!|`|g0emmGQ7aa	omg tampons  i just started wearing them today  and i love them  so much cleaner  and you can do more  its really scaring at first  but after a couple tries its easyy    ima wear a pad to bed though  just in case i sleep longer then 8 hours|`|dALX1qQdaa	nothing really good about pad.  they are GROSS  tampons all the way!!|`|vfL3Wo7raa	ummm...i do pads because to me they are safer and less mess. how do u dispose of a used tampon??|`|qATc02Zwaa	well tampons. I never leak I love them.

AVYUwkftaa	It's O.k. I have that too. Just don't worry about it. :) and don't pay attention to it. I have been told that when you have vaginal discharge that's telling you that your period is coming up. It's O.k. just be ready :)
3d65ce43ba27d8d0d29bb7d9241e044caa	Don't worry about going to sleep, you'll be fine. I've had two oral surgeries and I was out for both of them. One was because I had a trapped tooth, and they had to make a window in the gum to bring it down, and while they were in there they discovered a little extra tooth too! So they pulled that one-- it was weird...But it went fine, and suprisingly when I woke up later, I had really no pain. It was odd. Then my second was a couple years later when I got my wisdom teeth removed, which was more painful afterward, but I think that's pretty common for wisdom teeth removal. But anways, I was out for both of those, and they went fine. You should have nothing to worry about... :)|`|IKakoOfyaa	I had the same condition and had to have 4 teeth removed from under the gumline.  I elected to stay awake.  My advice to you would be to get the general and let them put you to sleep.|`|x3RAaLfNaa	I remember when i got my wisdom teeth I decided to get put down and I think that's the best way to go. If you get put to sleep you feel no pain during the precedure and it feels like it's only been 2 minutes. You do feel the pain afterwards whereas if you are awake you will hear, see, and feel everything that is going on and that makes me uncomforablte because I am not good with pain.|`|z2hmLQDLaa	Maybe this will be your deciding factor: the cost.<br>  <br>  Should you choose to be put to sleep, you will probably have to pay somewhere between an extra $300 to $500.  It's very unlikely that your insurance will cover IV sedation.  In conclusion: staying awake will save you money.<br>  <br>  But on the downside, you'll also have to put up with a lot of pressure from the drilling and the cutting that will happen during the procedure.  Not exactly what most people would like to deal with, especially if you're a dental phobe.  Most oral surgeons don't like dealing with patients who move around a lot during surgery.  It's bad for the surgeon and it's also bad for you.  If you choose to be awake, it's very important that you stay still without panicking no matter what's going on.<br>  <br>  Since you said you've never had surgery before, I should also include this: if you decide to go with IV sedation, do not eat or drink anything for at least 8 hours before surgery.  Not even the tiniest iota of water.  And if that's what you choose, you'll be knocked out almost instantly, and everything will be over as soon as you wake up (which will seem like seconds later).<br>  <br>  Both staying awake and going out have their downsides and upsides.<br>  <br>  Knowing all of this, it's your choice.|`|kj1md6t0aa	I just had my wisdom teeth out and I was the same as you .. all I was scared of was the anesthesia. I was terrified of it! But everything will be fine, it's easy, you're not really 'asleep', you just think you are. You are actually awake and aware the entire time but you eventually drift off and come off of it in the recovery room and you have no idea you were just in surgery. You don't remember anything and feel no pain.|`|NDMesTasaa	I just went through this and they encouraged me strongly to be put to sleep.  They don't mention right away that it costs $300 and that you have to sign a huge waiver contract saying you take all responsibility for your choice, since you can suffer brain damage and end up dead, to avoid some pain.  The fact is, you are still going to be uncomfortable, and feel the pain after it is done.  You will also be groggy afterward.  Plus, there is a possibility you may be awake and in a semi comatose state, feeling everything while they work on you.<br>  <br>  So I went with getting numbed and nitrous at the same time.  It was painful, but at least I wasn't in fear of being under with strangers all around.  When I left, I walked out and felt glad about my decision.
C0K3Bo2Aaa	I keep seeing an ad on TV for a thing called "crunchless abs". They have a site by the same name and it's only $10.00. I haven't bought it yet but plan to.|`|UFwz1FqBaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO1DctpRO... try going to youtube and typing in noglokel.He has an excellent ab routine that will help you se almost instant results!|`|1nIeHzofaa	Exercising is only 25% of  having nice abs.  The other 75% is why most people don't have them- their eating habits.  Don't go on a "diet" but change your lifestyle forever.  You need to stick to foods low in fat and almost no saturated fat.  Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low fat protein (fish, soy, beans, yogurt), and substitute olive oil for butter and mayo.  Mix in some cardio, push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups.  Do this every day and it will become a habit.  Watch those abs pop out and you will never go back!|`|Y5xfCdukaa	Do crunches but put your right hand on your left shoulder blade and your left hand on your right shoulder blade. This will cause you to use your abs rather than your hands pulling up your head!|`|DPc8o5qiaa	Yeah I agree that crunches are the best. Try to set a number of crunches you want to do in a day. i normally like to do crunches after I wake up  First do the usually crunches, but go all the way up, so you can touch your knees. then turn on your side and do crunches for both the left and right sides. Another good thing to do is to get an exercise ball or a puffy cushion. Have the cushion on the floor and do crunches with your back against the cushion or exercise ball. It should allow you to bend backwards as well as forwards when you do your crunches so you have more bend when you do the crunches. When you bend back, theres more stretch, and it exercises your abs more. :)
1df31c9db3dcca4d09a9e2c45066a64caa	Quantity wise no, but not a very healthy selection. I would eat leaner foods like turkey that are low calorie but high protein and good to use in many different forms from sausages, to burgers to sliced turkey.    Try beans as they are versatile to eat with other items and good for you. IF you neglect  your body it will not continue to work properly.    Try low cal fruit juices and low sugar items to drink as well for less calories if you are trying to watch your weight or are conscious of this.|`|PeCm21meaa	uh, no.  it kinda sounds like you have an eating disorder... if you do please seek help and don't live with the pain.  you won't regret it trust me.|`|nr5VfSguaa	No, but you can try to eat healthier. I recommend plain oatmeal cooked with vanilla soymilk and cinnamon for breakfast! I eat that every morning!|`|qg8o4gH5aa	umm no, if anything u ate too less. this is going to cause to burn calories slower and hold on to everything.|`|alDqf8DAaa	Depends on what kind of activities you've done. but that doesn't sound like enough! and im sorry but cookies and collard greens for breakfast?!?    eww :) haha|`|hnPgpulzaa	Nope. But don't have cookies for breakfast, that just sucks. If you have to have them for luck or dinner, not breakfast.

Am2WeOdRaa	Perfectionism, obsessive compulsive, anxiety, clinical depression - there are so many possible explanation for your symptoms, but the symptoms are certainly the kind of things you can get medical help to overcome.  There are holistic treatments and traditional medication, or a combination of the two.      Many people are able to hide mental health conditions, especially those with above average intelligence.  You might be surprised how many of those around you who are also seemingly doing fine.  One of my favorite saying, don't compare your insides to others outsides.|`|ParFJxnSaa	See stress treatments, at ezy build, below, in section 42. A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ).     Options: Try: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...  & http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio... & http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...  Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time. Also see: http://www.mindtools.com/stress/Relaxati... & http://relaxationemporium.com/ & http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/m... & http://tinyurl.com/29so4u & at http://www.lessons4living.com/ try the audio demonstration. At www.amazon.com/ enter: "sounds of the ocean", & "ambient rain sound", & "mountain river sounds" in the searchbar.     Repeat: "I feel calm" and/or "I can handle this." Employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself". A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.     For you, or others: A massage (at least neck and shoulders) with jasmine, lavender, juniper, and/or bergamot, or German chamomile essential oils added to the massage oil, and to a warm bath, preferably beforehand, to help make any tension knots and muscles more pliant (they may only want, say, a sandalwood & juniper, or bergamot mix:; check first). I am aware of advice that strong heat, applied to essential oils can damage them, and so I would not use a diffuser. Also consider anise, basil, bay, eucalyptus, peppermint, rose, or thyme.|`|WJ7pRtD3aa	you sound like a Pisces... just like me I worry all the time about trivial things.. you will learn to control it whether you are or not tho.. so.. don't worry about worrying|`|iYRBbpGWaa	Maybe that's your problem. I used to be the same way. I kept everything in and didn't let people catch on to how I was feeling or what I was thinking. After a while I became really good friends with the pastor and his wife. I'm almost 18 and they're in their twenties, so we're close in age. I live with them now (long story) and the pastor's wife started to notice it. After a while I started talking about it. It was hard, but I felt so much better. Even if they couldn't do anything about it, just telling someone what I was thinking made me feel a little bit better, and saying it aloud got it out of my deepest thoughts for a while. It's not a permanent fix, but it helps temporarily. In that time you can figure out ways to make it better permanently, or at least longer, for you. Everyone is different so I can't help long term. No matter what, keep your head up high and think positive whenever possible. When those thoughts come up in your mind, analyze it and try and see the positive. I know from experience that it can be hard to see positive in certain things, but believe me, if you really try to see the positive, you will eventually see it, even if it's only a little glimmer. Good luck and God bless.|`|Ytpq9PCfaa	if you dont make the team it eans oyur going to make something ealse ,life has a long road ahead for you and if you go witht he flow and enjoy the ride you'll get to were you need to go ,if you stress and try to change it you will still get there in life but only the harder way! relax....|`|oE0BpxPkaa	Relax, and realize what you're going through is PERFECTLY normal.

I just eat fruits (sometimes I don't really like fruits other than apples and oranges)    You need lots of grain too.. like bread..pasta..spaghetti, rice.  oatmeal? =]    Since you're eating every three hours.. it really doesn't matter how much you eat since your metabolism will be trained to be really fast|`|KjxtziGYaa	Go on-line and look up the zone diet.

First of diet is 80% of the equation.  For my female clients I suggest 4-6 meals a day depending on there schedule.  As for calories take 10 x your body weight...for exampe if you weigh 160 take 1600 calories a day.  Important never go below 1,000 calories a day, all this will do is shut your body down.  Try to drink close to 1 gallon of water a day to flush out the toxins.  Here is a typical day.  Meal 1 protein shake, or oatmeal or high fiber cereal with skim milk  Snack 2 yogurt, or piece of fruit with string cheese  Meal 3 Chicken breast and veggies  Snack 4 2oz of peanuts  Meal 5 Chicken, salmon or lean meat with veggies.  If you have a sweet tooth Jello is the way to go with only 10 calories and you can put on some fat free whip cream if you like.

It's happened to me.   Your period varies every time depending on your sleeping, and eating  patterns not to mention other factors.   talk to your doctor just to be safe|`|ocjfZQvfaa	Periods do strange things sometimes. You might get it again before 28 days. But they can last only a day, and sometimes go for longer than 7.|`|wpR5AX5waa	Is it your time of the month? If so, is there any chance that you could be pregnant? If so, wait a day or two, and if you don't get anything else, I'd suggest taking a test. If not, your period may just be really light this month. If you're concerned, you may want to go see a gynecologist.|`|T7Q8T9rxaa	That's how my first period was.  Congratulations!

o5SYMzDkaa	Your definately not alone.  I often feel the same way, and although I have never cut myself, lets just say I've done some pretty stupid stuff.  Just remember that your parents DO care about you, but like many people, may not like confrontation.  PLEASE continue trying to talk to them though.  Problems never get resolved by inflicting pain upon yourself.   Another thing that has really helped me is my religion.  If you aren't religious, don't worry, there are plenty of other things (writing, drawing, sports, or even just talking to friends) that you can do to help deal with your emotions.

pvYy6iTSaa	ohjoy - CP is an important medical condition because porphyria attacks can be very serious. Prevention and early management of attacks is the main goal. With a sensible approach and good medical supervision a person can have a normal lifespan and normal quality of life. <br>  <br>  Symptoms<br>  There are various symptoms which a person can experience during an attack of porphyria however most involve the nervous system and skin. Attacks are rare before puberty and uncommon after menopause. The majority of attacks can be traced to a precipitating factor. <br>  The most common symptoms during an attack of acute porphyria are:<br>  1. stomach/abdominal pain (90% of patients)<br>  2. dark urine (74%)<br>  3. pains, numbness or tingling of arms and legs (40-50%)<br>  4. constipation (48%)<br>  5. nausea/vomiting (43%)<br>  6. hallucinations or mood swings (40%)<br>  Others are weakness in arms or legs, loss of feeling in hands and feet, seizures or fits, fevers or chest pain. For most people, mild symptoms are more frequent than acute attacks. <br>  Chronic skin problems occur in 30% of people and may fluctuate in severity. Episodes are not generally related to porphyria attacks. Patients can develop liver disease, but this is later in the condition, and very rare.
FW0iLLKXaa	Are you sure the odour isn't coming from her snatch?
vjmXiIfnaa	No I don't think your body eats all your nutrients when your sick. If it dead then we would simply be dead. No other functions would be functioning if all the "building blocks" went directly to the ill function.
cNzBfgFnaa	I guess it depends on where you live abouts.  If you let me know a little about your area, maybe I could help you find some kind of support if you are not able to go to your parents.  I think in a situation like this, a support group or someone that is not judgemental is the right way to go.  I learned that if I want to loose some weight, it is really all up to ME.  I have to want it for myself and nobody else. What you need to do is stop dieting, those things NEVER work.  they do sometimes immediately, but you end up just gaining it back and usually twice the amount.  You should look at the South Beach Diet...it says diet and it does jump start you to loose weight fast, but it also teaches you how to eat once you have lost to maintain the weightloss. Also, you can do a body cleanse.  Go to your nearest health food store and ask for a good full body or just a colon cleanse.  It is a good way to enter into a new life and a new eating pattern.  If you try to do the quick weightloss for quick personal weighloss, believe me, you will be much worse off.  Change your life and not only will you loose the weight, the depression is more likely to disappear and your self confidence will boost because not only do you look good, but you feel good. So.....  1. It is a LIFE CHANGE  2. Get a journal  3.Get a Low carb diet book with some good recipies and a kitchen scale to measure your food.  4. Do a body or colon cleanse to jump start your life change  5. Ask your family to help support you in your decision to make this life change to better your health.  6. Find an exercise that you like, Yoga, Pilates or walking are good for starters.  7. Make sure to journal what you eat every day and your water intake, i found it easier to plan what I was going to eat the day prior and have it to follow, Less slip ups that way.  have baggies of fruit and veggies in the fridge ready to grab, also peanuts/almonds pre proportioned is good.  GET STARTED  and dont give up.  We all have bad days, we all slip up...if you do, just get back on and get started again.    Good luck and I hope this helps you so that you are not unhealthy.  People DIE all of the time taking drugs for weighloss and mixing harmfull combinations....please do not be one of these quick fix people, life is not a quick fix, it is a very long learning process.     Take Care!  4.|`|9EgXeA2waa	i am a boy but im like that.. dont do drugs or anything serious just stick to a excercise regime.. mine isnt heavy just pushups and sit ups...  i went for 10 to 15 the next night to 20 butthe higher youget the less you add|`|f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	It would really help if you learned to spell appropriately.  The fact that you made yourself vomit after "eating too much."  That is bulimia.  There's no middle ground, you can't be a little bulimic, it's like being pregnant you are or you aren't.    You most definitely need to talk to someone about this, and I mean a professional.  Sounds like you have issues with body image.  This is not something that can be fixed on yahoo answers.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	well if you only did it once, i dont think you have a problem. you can talk to your doctor about weight loss help though.    and everyone gets depressed every now and then. you just seem a little self concious. perfectly normal|`|OFCCgLdKaa	This is not bulimia, this is anorexia. Stop it NOW. You want a good body? Eat properly, nobody likes stick thin girls with ribs that show through their chest, it looks disgusting. You want to lose weight? Eat breakfast to kick start your metabolism, join a gym, eat healthy foods and your body will be beautiful but for God's sake don't become anorexic.

Then realize that it's not as much how much you eat as what you eat. Also, it's important to eat about 6 times a day. A good breakfast of cereal and low fat milk, good cereal not sugary crap. A portion about the size of your fist. Stay away from breads as much as you can. This is hard for me because I love bread. Eat a snack or drink an energy drink, like myoplex or something similar about three hours later. Eat a healthy lunch, again skip the bread and fried foods, also stay away from fast foods. Then three hours later another small snack or drink as mentioned before. Snacks should be healthy, fruits, veggies, etc. Have a well balanced dinner before 6pm if possible and then a light snack about 8pm, popcorn is good so is fruit. Give this time and don't expect miracles right away, but it will happen. Already 15 lbs in three months. Also, exercise never hurts even if it's just a half hour walk.|`|UBXeT19Baa	Hi  Love yourself first,  I am with a very large women with gland probs plus diabetes.

Most of the sites on the internet talk about the more extreme forms, but it is more of a question of degree.    If you are worrying about your weight and dieting when you are normal weight then you are likely in the early stages of it.    My next best advice is not to worry about your weight at all.     Eat when you are hungry and go out and enjoy your life.    There are bigger things to worry about than whether you fit somebody else's idea of the perfect weight.    (besides, most guys like girls that jiggle and wiggle as they giggle)|`|gY7D6Eboaa	I think I am a bit the same.. minus the vomiting and depression though...  I really want to exercise and i feel really bad sometimes but I always end up thinking that no matter how sad I feel about my weight, it's not going to make me skinny. Either I exercise, or I don't. It's always my choice, and if I choose to be lazy well then I suffer the consequences.    What really cheers me up, though, is when I see couples in public and the guy is good looking and the girl isn't skinny, but isn't fat. hah. It's very cheering, to think that some guys don't care.    Ok, if you want to do something, why not join a netball or other sport team with a few of your friends? Or, if you have the same problem I do, where I want to exercise but I don't want my family knowing, make up a little routine that you do before bedtime in your bedroom.  Include sit-ups, push-ups, squats, lunges, and that cycling exercise... you know, where you lay on your back with your feet in the air and pretend to cycle?   By the end of this little routine, you'll go to sleep so quickly because you're so tired!    Or, maybe you could get an exercise dvd and do it by yourself or with friends or with your mum, or someone?

NLAek2bJaa	He most likely used a scaler. They use them to get the hard buildup off of your teeth that you cant remove by brushing from your daily routine. It requires a metal instrument for them to remove it. Removing that will help prevent decay and gum irritation. Its better to prevent than have a problem thats more painful. If you floss more, try once a day, the cleaning will not be uncomfortable anymore. The more you can get your gums healthy, no pain.  If you bleed while flossing, floss more. The more you floss, the less bleeding you will get. Bleeding is your body naturally telling you there is bacteria in there that it is trying to get rid of. Just some helpful tips for your next visit.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	He was just scrapping the plaque off your teeth.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Sounds like the plaque scraper.

a6An96Araa	First of all, CALM DOWN! :)  You are perfectly safe, and trust me, you have nothing to worry about.  A lot of girls don't get their periods until they are 14 or sometimes even 15, and even THAT takes a while to regulate.    Because you are 13, your body, like you said, is regulating itself.    You need to realize that having discharge and cramps are a GOOD thing.  It means that your body is changing and getting ready to start it's permanent menses (period).    If you are "late", then yes, it could be because of stress, but most likely your body is just adjusting to the change.    Your body is an incredibly smart thing, and it's not going to make a mistake.  You obviously have absolutely no chance of pregnancy, so like you said, it has nothing to do with that.    I would suggest relaxing and letting your body do its thing.  It will eventually settle down, and then you'll have a regular period once its ready.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	Yes, it's late because you're still regulating.  Stress can cause it to be late too.

mqXyDTwwaa	During the off season they take lots of muscle building drugs, eat until they can't eat anymore, and lift heavy weights. This causes a big increase in muscle and fat. Just before a competition they take drugs to lose fat and excess water, so you can see their muscles.    Edit: No, Mike, bodybuilders don't do cardio. They take drugs.|`|5kXxr6r0aa	great question man, it used to bug me for a while but i've done a lot of research of pros and amateurs methods since then and it makes a lot of sense really.    its all on their bodyfat percentage really. To be around 300 pounds is almost impossible to achieve while maintaining a low bodyfat percentage, so off season, bodybuilders will allow themselves to maybe go up in bodyfat, losing some definition but still they'll be building some muscle under it (this is usually called bulking and is widely used by bodybuilders and powerlifters).    for preseason they'll start working out more intensely and doing a lot more cardio workouts to burn off fat, taking them down to usually around 3% bodyfat. obviously its astounding they can drop 60 pounds in just a few months without sacraficing any muscle, but when bodybuilding is your sport and you dedicate hours upon hours of your day to working out, its completely achievable.|`|LtX0lAUIaa	They go on rigid diets before a competition to eliminate nearly all body fat. This increases the muscle definition.  It is not healthy to stay on such a rigid diet for long, so they go off the diet (but still eat healthy) after the contest.  This makes them gain off season.
YdBg9NaWaa	well if you're going just to talk to your doctor, don't be worried, he or she will just ask you some questions about your sex life things like that.    if they're going to do a standard procedure, don't be nervous.

iK3YYRaTaa	This here answers all your questions about blood tests.<br>  <br>  What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels<br>  <br>  There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes. <br>  <br>  Fasting Blood Sugar Test:<br>  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test. <br>  <br>  Random Blood Glucose Test:<br>  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes. <br>  <br>  Oral glucose tolerance test<br>  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus. <br>  <br>  Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test<br>  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes. <br>  <br>  The cinnamon is fine . Try this also:<br>  Lime and lemon juice delay the digestion of starches as does vinegar. I've found that 2-3 tablespoons of lime or lemon juice reduces my post prandial BG response by 10-20 points. Rick Mendosa's site has a lot of material on acids in the diet. Take a look at <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/acidic_foods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mendosa.com/acidic_foods.htm</a> .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	The ADA guidelines say that you may  have diabetes if you have fasting glucose readings over 125.  Your fasting readings are all within normal limits.  Your doctor should do an HbA1c test, it is more accurate than the info from a home use glucometer.  In addition, you don't have to fast for that type of test.  12 hours fasting is more than enough to get a reading from your glucometer.|`|MSVrkmKnaa	for the fasting rate(no foo for at least 8 hours) is above 100 but below 125 it's Pre Diabetes.

Just as if you fix your hair then step out the door into the wind, it is no longer the same.<br>  <br>  You must have a blood draw to check the HbA1c levels which are a percentage of glucose clinging to the red blood cells over the last 90 days. This number should be between 4 and 6 with 5 being perfect.<br>  <br>  There is no way you can cheat on that test! You can eat or fast before it and it won't change.<br>  But they usually do other testing along with that that do require fasting. Such as the lipids panel.<br>  <br>  this chart is specified for diabetic suggested normals <br>  <br>  American Diabetes Association (ADA) versus American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)<br>  <br>  ADA says...

Test fasting first thing after rising.|`|EeTs9DqUaa	Per the ADA guidelines to diagnose diabetes your results are:<br>  "With the FPG test, a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl signals pre-diabetes. A person with a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher has diabetes.<br>  <br>  In the OGTT test, a person's blood glucose level is measured after a fast and two hours after drinking a glucose-rich beverage. If the two-hour blood glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl, the person tested has pre-diabetes. If the two-hour blood glucose level is at 200 mg/dl or higher, the person tested has diabetes."<br>  <br>  <br>  Also the test HAS to be repeated on another day to come to a diagnosis of diabetes.  If you did not get tested a second time your doctor did not diagnose you correctly.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	I am in the UK and my test results were measured differently - they give you leaflets explaining what the will be doing, it says nothing to eat or drink from the night before and on the day only water, 1st blood test is taken, it is is to get a normal reading, you then drink a bottle of lucozade and wait 2 hours for 2nd test, that then tells the level with the sugar in the body, mine was 6 and 13, I have diet controlled diabetes, the 3rd month test isn't a fasting test, this is just to measure how well the body is coping and if it is managing to get the sugar out of your body and usually done every 6 months and also be seen by a dietitian, podiatrist and, eye department of hospital on a yearly basis, I have no family history. Your diet seems very good but it may have nothing to do with what you eat its just one of those tings and you might need medication.

Also a supplement ALA has shown good results in reducing the pain and some of the nerve damage.  As your levels drop you will feel more pain as the nerves start to funtion properly.

For example you could mix the Special K with the Slimfast. Or the Slimquick with the Blood Type Diet.  Either Way, they are all diets.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweight lossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.
CbHt7QUvaa	Ignore these immature answers.    Yes, it is safe to start weightlifting. However, take it slow at the beginning! Get someone to help you learn some lifts such as proper bench technique, squatting, curls, triceps extension, push ups, hang clean, power clean, and the many more exercises.     With that being said, there is ways you can over do it. It will take going above and beyond to stunt your growth tho. All you have to do is to NOT work on a set of muscles more than every other day. So your schedule could be; Monday-Chest, Tuesday-Legs, Wednesday-Break, Thursday- Chest/arms, Friday-Legs. It is important to have a few days off, especially for your age.    Good Luck!|`|r8Sme80raa	You can also try bench pressing your folks car! LOL|`|H2w0bJmPaa	dude  lift that ****  like mad  (it doesnt stunt your growth at all)  if your school has a weight lifting class as PE take it      it will make you bigger and stronger, but i dont know if you care about that.|`|HH56ptnNaa	lifting weights will never stunt your growth it just makes your muscles strong and possibly bigger|`|ZjbbrRVoaa	Well, I've got a sports book that definitely says, underage over-exercise will stop your bones from growing properly. Is it outdated or inaccurate? I don't know.
SpL2MPDraa	Actually, contrary to what most people will say, I think [depending on your health] that it IS, in fact, relatively safe to do even more than that.  I say this from personal experience. There was a period in time, throughout the long amount of time that i've been doing DXM [and I mean a LONG time] that I was doing 300-900mg doses for weeks straight at a time. Once I did this for 3 weeks straight, and after I got done, my brain felt like mushy cheese, but the main negative effect I experienced from this was a near complete loss of short term memory. However, this went away after doing no DXM for about 4 days, and I started doing it again after that. That was about 3 months ago, and I, to this day, do dxm for entire weekends at a time, and I still feel quite mentally sound, lol.    So really, I think it depends a lot on your current health...  And if you do DXM for extended amounts of time, or repeatedly, just use the signals your body gives you. If you feel like you shouldn't do it because you've already done too much in too short a period of time, then don't.  Hope I helped ^_^|`|OUXO6g6Laa	Probably not, but there's no definitive answer.  Brain damage from DXM has never been reported in a human, which is not to say that it doesn't happen.  The real areas of concern would the liver and the heart.  Both of yours are unique to you, as is your dosage, so the risks are fuzzy.    The bottom line is if you're healthy, I wouldn't recommend against recreational usage once a week.  Twice a week for heavier trips (more than say 7.5mg/kg) is pushing it.|`|noCVbwY3aa	What is moderate?  I'm 115 lbs, and I take 300 mg per day usually...Please, do not be like me.  I'm self medicating and need to stop.  You know what plateau you are hitting right?  If not, search for the dxm calculator and figure it out for your body weight.  To be as safe as humanly possible and still do dxm, the general rule of thumb is 1 week of rest per plateau (i.e. 3rd plateau trip, 3 weeks of rest).  While Olney's Lesions are not found in humans on dxm, the mere presence of it in rodents suggests something malicious happening in your brain.     Most will classify it as a teenage drug, but that's simply because of it's  availability.  I've read reports on people who say it's wonderful and love it.  Others say between all drugs they have done (meth and cocaine included) DXM has messed their life up the most.      Be safe, friend.

Also, make sure you are getting enough protein.  Basically, you need to eat a balanced diet.  If this doesn't help, get tested for anemia and mono.  I once was anemic and could sleep 10-12 hours at night and nap for 2-3 hours during the day.  If you are anemic, you will have to take iron supplements.  Also, you might be Vitamin B deficient.  That can also cause anemia.  Good luck figuring it out.|`|FICaPDxdaa	You could be Anemic.    I'm Anemic, but I have Low Iron, but that causes me to be tired all the time.

It all depends on your schedule and everyones different :)|`|lP6aObLhaa	ok could be that your not getting enough iron in your diet or you have mono Or PMS (hormone imbalances could make you sleepy).|`|q8uIqbVhaa	hmm, check your thyroid levels and your other hormones, you might have low thyroids or some other hormone problems. Or you might just be tired from doing too many chores and tasks during the day.  Remember that activities like cooking, cleaning, working etc. are real exhausting.  or it might be a tiredness caused by boredom, or by living in a bad boring, depressive environment, some times ugliness and ugly people themselves cause depression and tiredness.    .    .

zqYdkP2Waa	Sorry to hear about your grandparents, There are many reasons people suffer and die in which we cant explain. And its really sad that we sometimes feel helpless and miserable as we watch them suffer, feeling there is nothing we can do, wanting with all our hearts to help them and relieve them of at least some of their pain and misery. Please don't blame yourself you arent the reason for his poor health. If you want to do something to help your grandpa, the best thing you can do is share your love and affection with him. Where he is far from you (his family) it would probably mean a lot to him to know how much you love him. It is usually very uplifting when those you love and care about, return their love. Where you cant see him or call him, a letter would be really nice, if he cant read it there is probably someone there who can read it to him. It is also something that he can hold on to and reread when he needs a pick up, or just a reminder of how special he is to you. And please try hard not to be mad at God. He loves us all and only want the best for us. If anything this might be a time to draw closer to him. Fortunately as you may or may not know, God has given us the things we need to heal our bodies (even cancer). It doesnt need to be researched and doesnt cost a lot of money to find it. Its all aorund us, if we would only use it. If you want to help in curing cancer, a good place to start would be to learn more about it. What it is, what causes it and how to help our bodies get rid of it, with what God has already given us - for free- out of love and caring through tenderness. I've attached a website address, which is a good a place to start as any. Read about cancer and get a better understanding of it and how our bodies are affected by our lifestyles. Also for a good treatment, you may want to look at the "Incurables Diet" on the same site. You may be able to use the information to help your grandpa and others. Also if I might suggest, and I would recommend this to anyone dealing with such a disease, try to find a good natural doctor (naturopath, and herbalist) that believes in the natural god-given treatment of our bodies. Keep praying and stay close to Heavenly Father and he will comfort you. My prayers are with you and your family. Wishing you the best, and God bless.|`|sTodQmGaaa	I cannot help you with the rest of your question but i can pray with you, I also am from italy just like your grandfather and i am very very very sorry for your loss. Though have you ever thought heaven is a much better place then earth? And as each time you have your Communion god is repaying you by putting someone close to you out of their misery and suffering that they are going through on earth. He has taken them to a much better place and i bet you anything your grandmother is like your gaurdian angel, looking out for you as you grow older and i'm sure your grandfather will do the same when its his time.    You dont need to see your grandmother to still love her, because when you truely love someone they live inside you. just like the love for god - you will see her again and as for your grandfather he will be in a better place.

GvQHw4Ntaa	There's nothing wrong at all with same blood group couples. If the woman has RH negative blood and the man has RH positive blood, then the child will have positive blood and the woman's body will (during childbirth) be exposed to the positive blood and develop antibodies to fight against it. During a second pregnancy, the woman's body (due to these new antibodies) would literally attack the fetus. This isn't a problem anymore, however... in 1968 a drug was produced that is now administered to women who have RH negative blood before their first childbirth, so they never develop the antibodies and can have many children with a man of any blood type without trouble.|`|HDUq1ls7aa	What are you asking again?

1XjATDxEaa	I've been a personal trainer for eight years and a gymnastics coach for three years just so you know i'm not just tossing this out there lol.    My first point is diets they just don't work, atkins has caused a lot of problems for people along with other diets. Mainly because it's just not built for success and it's one diet built for millions of people. It's impossible for it to work for everyone. You are you, you can't do a diet that's just been created for loads of people.  What you need to do is change your complete lifestyle not just a few weeks or a few months on a program.    I need some information to help you more specifically, age, height, weight, how often you work out? how long you've been working out? when you do work out is it for an hour or how long? what does your work out consist of? Or anything that could affect you like medications (birth control etc)    When it comes to eating, the main rule you should learn is if it God didn't make it don't eat it. Eliminate/decrease intake of refined sugars, dairy products and processed food for the rest of your life. Control...there's nothing wrong with the occasionally piece of cake when you're out and about, but going out for dinner and having one every time is just a bad road to take. A tip to everyone out there, it's more than a weight thing it's a healthy life thing lol. You need a balanced diet, eat a  little of everything simple things like eating a handful of almonds and blueberries for a snack can help you do to their importance in your health.  In a combination with your food changes should be a workout that always changes...more than just walking or running on the treadmill and doing crunches. Kickboxing, pilates, interval training on the weekends walking/jogging/running is great to burn fat fast and keep it off.    Your body is a full unit a machine...if you're stressed it automatically affects your digestive system and well your whole body which is contributing to your weight staying pretty much the same. Try yoga or pilates to calm you down, you need to find something where you can release your stress and feel good afterwards...music dancing...whatever... don't focus on your weight. Focusing on your health, what you want for the rest of your life...and it will all fall into place. It's not about the number it's about how you look and feel.     And remember don't run from weights you need muscle to eat up the fat you want to get rid of.  If you're a vegetarian, be sure to toss in beans etc avacados, for your protein. You need to add in all of your food groups and you'll be set along with a great exercise program.    feel free to contact me if you want some more assistance.|`|1nIeHzofaa	First of all, you need to stop "dieting."  Dieting is short term and when it ends you'll probably gain most of the weight again.  Change your lifestyle with respect to eating habits.  Try foods low in fat and almost no saturated fat.  Eat a lot of fresh/ frozen fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low fat protein(soy, beans, yogurt).  Give up butter and mayo and substitute with olive oil.  Add crushed red pepper to to some of your meals to help speed up metabolism.  Most carbs burn up to fast and leave you feeling hungry.  Whole grains and proteins will take longer to digest.|`|AEAxZEveaa	Yes, the lack of meat is affecting your results. What on earth are you eating? Just cheese and vegetables? There's no way to keep your carb intake under 20 grams if you don't eat any meat. If I were you I would look into some other diets that will work with a vegetarian diet.    edit: Oh, you're not allowed to eat tofu on atkins! :-) That's why you're not losing weight as fast. Hey, if you like it, then stick to it, but realize that you're not going to lose weight as fast as people who are eating mostly meat. Oh ,and plus, the high fat content on the diet is part of why people lose so fast. It's hard to get your fat content up there if you're doing a vegetarian version.    Haha, I don't know what else to tell you. How much weight do you have to lose?|`|RYavIzvTaa	The Atkins Diet is very unhealthy. Carbs are the basis of any healthy diet, and restricting them too much can be dangerous. I suggest a different diet.|`|pVDxOwUpaa	I would try a different diet altogether.

GqdEfuo8aa	wow, you're already super skinny, but if you insist on losing weight, then yes 1 1/2 pounds every two weeks is totally reasonable. A healthy rate of weight loss is .5-2 pounds a week. For you, since your body doesn't need to lose any weight, it'll probably come off on the slower side. People who have a hundred pounds to lose, lose it at a higher rate. Good luck!|`|el8yX5q3aa	Losing one pound a week is reasonable...and sensible.|`|mzAE9iesaa	Yes, very reasonable|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	you should expect to lose 1 - 2 pounds every week, most weeks.   How can you gain 10 lbs IN A MONTH????|`|qE49jbVaaa	it's reasonable to lose 2 lbs? 1 week                             p.s. hippo's arent cute|`|DRSU2pz4aa	That's one of the first logical goals I've see on this website.

AVzQs5Uhaa	AS LONG AS NONE  OF THE YOGURT HAS BEEN RECALLED YOU SHOULD BE OK, THOUGH IT PROBABLY CONTAINED QUITE A BIT OF SUGAR, IT WAS STILL A FAIRLY HEALTHY CHOICE.

TORBP6QIaa	yes its totally possible to get yeast infections while still a virgin...eating too much sugar , anti-biotics, synthetic panties, soap on your genitals, too tight irritating jeans,...these are the main causes of a yeast infection...the doctor may or may not ask about your sexual experience...if you are over 16 you are definitely old enough to go to the doctor alone...    If this discharge is making you really itchy and a bit sore and you have read up on yeast infections and you are pretty sure thats what you have...then just go to the chemist and get the cream...    Are you still too young in your mother's eyes to be a virgin?...I know its an embarrassing thing to disclose to your mum...many years ago my mum took me to the ER one night as I had an ovarian cyst that burst...mum fainted when the doctor asked me if I could be pregnant...i just went red with embarrassment....dont worry...whatever happens...you cannot get back your virginity and oneday your mum is going to have to accept the fact that her little girl is all grown up.|`|vfL3Wo7raa	first of all ur mother is wrong im sorry you can get a yeast infection from alot of things no just sex.  n yes if ur doctor does a vaginally exam he or she will be able to tell if u are a virgin or not.  you can get a yeast infection from wearing tight underwear or wiping in the wrong direction.  or if u wear underwear that is wet for an extended period of time or if u sweat down there it will bring an infection. remember all bacteria needs to grow is a moist dark area. so no worries just go to ur gyn and get checked. next be honest with ur mom n tell her the truth because u dont want it to be a suprise wen the doctor says or asks u are u sexually active. its worse if she finds out and u didn't tell her.|`|wNXq55tWaa	yes you can get a yeast infection when you're a virgin and the doctor doesn't have to tell her anything you don't want them to|`|qttFnNz7aa	when you go to the doctor you can tell your doctor that you dont feel comfortable having your mom  in the room and he will ask her not to go in and if she insists say you wont go if shes in there... and the doctor will be able to tell your not a virgin but he cant say ANYTHING to your mom about it if you tell him not to   and you CAN get a yeast infection from other things than sex|`|HCMrR1O9aa	you can spesifically ask the doctor not to tell your mother!! the only reason a doctor can disclose informations to your mother, even if you are a minor is if it will effect your health, if you ask him not to tell HE CANT.....eat yogurt, that will clear the infection up, and you can also get over the counter medicine that will clear it up, I have heard that wearing extremly tight jeans can cause yeast infections, but i honestly dont know id that is true, but you can try it....i hope i helped, and be carefull, idk how old you are but if your having sex be safe please...|`|V2hv7W98aa	you hymen breaks during intercourse. you can say that your tampon must have done it, because it is possible for a tampon to break it, but its not likely.    Yes you can get it from intercourse, but it is rare. Most often, women dont get yeast infections from sex. The most common cause is a weak immune system. Small amounts of yeast are always in the vagina. But when too much yeast grows, you can get an infection.|`|4YHlEurYaa	A doctor cant tell if ur a virgin or not. you can tear the skin just by doing the splits or by getting hit between the legs.  i dont no about the yeast infection but i have never heard of only getting yeast infections from being sexually active. so im not sure on that part.|`|HzFgIgPzaa	if you go into the doctor's room alone than your fine and your mom can sit back in the waiting room. how would your mom know who is a virgin and who is not?!|`|qu7DSLTqaa	Yes, you can get a yeast infection while a virgin. Let your mom make the appointment, drive you, etc. but when it comes to the exam, you can request she not be there (there will be a nurse). While you're in for the exam, you can talk with the Dr. alone...ask any questions then. Also let Dr. know that you want your information to be confidential (your mom only needs to know what you want her to know).  You do need to take care of this quickly. Yeast infections can cause permanent damage if not treated!    If all else fails, get in at a free clinic on your own. You can buy the over the counter yeast infection meds...but you should see a Dr. for a first infection and for a basic exam... You need a pap, possibly the new shot for cervical cancer, and a discussion about safe sex-it's not just about birth control anymore!    I don't know how old you are, but I really wish you could talk to your mom... I feel proud that my daughters (3) and I could talk about sex or any other subject that came up.
LlEr2OdBaa	it will come in time. 14 is still young i have friends that didn't start until they were 16 or 17. athletic girls and thin girls are more likely to start later in life. ask your mom when she started you may start right around that same age.     You should be happy not have it. i understand your want for your body to change and to fit in. just know that when it starts so will the cramps and the pimples.     it will come. soon.|`|eMDnLUpqaa	Your period will come when it is the right time. believe me when it does you will wish it did not because it is a mess and a pain.  The period does not really change your look or apperance at all. Puberty does and all parts of puberty come at different times for everyone. Make sure you eat a healthy balanced diet to achieve the right curves in all of the right places. If you are having issues being happy with your body share that with your doctor or your mom|`|0AQF8pnKaa	OMG. calm down! you'll get your period, it's no big deal. i hate having mine- it's wet, gross, you feel really bad, and it sucks. i would be glad, if i were you, that i hadn't gotten it yet.  btw, getting your period does not mean automatically you'll get curves and boobs and hips. in fact the only thing that happens is you gain a little bit of weight. i have had mine since I was in 7th grade and i still looked like a pancake up until last year.|`|bFWhuJbuaa	i promise you, you dont want it. its a pain in the behinndddd.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	you don't want your period to start. but it usually starts once you have a fair amount of pubic hair. there is no way to make it start earlier.  Taking anything like hormones will stunt your growth even more.|`|385b5c9d7cdef8d18d881b50a9b24b0faa	i dont have it yet and im 13...  ALL my friends tell me that it's PAINFUL.  and i'm really short, too.  like, 4'8 short.  the weird thing is that i have sorta big boobs for my height, size, and age...  but don't worry, it'll come under the next year or so, since you have discharge.  i know how you feel, i always feel SO left out in everything, but you have to just cope until it comes.|`|3fcc8a67fc109dc6d5e33948cbbf4447aa	heh. In a couple years you'll regret this question and remember me telling you so LOLOLOL count yourself blessed it aint worth it lol. Are you active in sports? with your figure it may be possible that you produced to many male hormones and this usually occurs when your physically active in sports. Some women I know didn't et it until they were 17/18|`|dlJ5GpOraa	trust me u dont want ur period! i just got mine last year and it is annoying.   and dont worry about not having boobs or curves. i dont have boobs either. they will come in soon!|`|97hUEezGaa	Oh, Gosh, I was so oppisite. I got early. :x. I got my pubic hair in second grade.... Man. Periods are okay. Boobs too. But its a pain in the butt to have sticky messyness down there. Everyone gets it sooner or later. Enjoy it now. Were all still growing. I look like my age, but my voice sounds like I'm 4. T_T. Boobs.. Ahh. Well, they hurt growing. But overall, patience will pay off D;|`|cDpu1Dxyaa	wow, Chill out lol    You will probably get it soon, I'm thinking 14/15 (nothing wrong with that, just means you're a bit of a late bloomer)    I got mine when I was 12 so I guess I don't know much about how it feels to be "left out of a period".  But seriously, calm down. It will most likely come soon and probably when you least expect it.    And don't think it will turn you into some hot supermodel either. Periods are uncomfortable, sometimes painful and are not very reliable in the way of body development. You think you might get some nice boobs, but you'll actually get a bit fatter (especially ever period) and your hips will round out (it will help your boobs, but only to the extent of how they would grow naturally, not everyone is guaranteed a knockout pair)    moral of the story: Period = Lame but unfortunately neccesary    you will get it soon most likely, if you don't, then chill, if you get to 18 and it hasn't come, then you need to worry.    oh! and it's awakward talking to your mother about your first one at ANY age|`|8WYFLp1Baa	hahaha, uhhh trust me. you DON'T want it.  you just think you do, but once you get it you WILL hate it.  it really sucks. boobs aren't so great either, guys always stare at them and try to touch them, it gets annoying. be happy with your body.  you'll grow up eventually.|`|513DGClraa	Save yourself the points, becuase none of us can tell you when it will come|`|vR6AwIppaa	when i first got my period, i really wanted it soo badly. i ALMOST wanted it as much as you [you really want it, don't you? note the sarcasm] the first period i got, i was really excited and thought it was kind of new and fun. but then it got really gross and disgusting and now i hate it. i feel like i'm cursed for life, because i got my period before all of my friends and it wasn't fair.    you'll probably get your period soon, since you're going to be 14 and you've gotten discharge for a few years.    i have advice!! just tell your friends that you got your period. they'll never know.  when you go to their house and bring a bag, just every once in a while bring a few pads or tampons every month so they don't suspect anything.|`|TEFDBRVmaa	PLZ girl I wasz like that...but then I got it at age 11 so0 I wouldn't know..but even though I had my period I didn't start to grow till two yearsz later....    Trust me take it from the girl who hasz had it for 3 yearsz...u won't want it when ur caught with no pad(bad friend expierence)or the first day u get it u have on a skirt like I did    Or when ur asking one of ur friendsz for a midol or advil or a heating pad to control ur cramps(never happen to me..a friend)....    but I understand how u feel..I totally do..I mean all my friends are not virginsz ?  me and my boyfriend of 10 monthsz are the only virginsz in our group..so I do understand u..I J?? sit in the quiet trying not to be seen...it isz like they try to rub it in..but it doesn't work because I know that I am better because I waited...lol.they suck..anywaysz u will get it soon ?  then u won't feel left out...I wish u the best|`|6GWctkQzaa	eventually yes.  -  but i don't like it. so not sure if you want to wish. It messes up plans.|`|iM1i07gEaa	Ok, your friend are weird. I never talked to my friends about my period, ever. And periods suck. You get to bleed for like 50 years once a month for 5 days. Why are you in a hurry?!|`|gavOMKgnaa	i know what you mean.. i'm 13 (14 on march 16th) and all my friends (but 3 of them) have it.. i always feel left out too|`|x105QI8Uaa	well you DON't want it. just wear padded bras.|`|ZYnuQoyOaa	Well first of all you need to be over 100 pounds to actually get so if your really petite that it will take longer. Also YOU DONT WANT IT !!!!!! I get cramps that are soo bad that I cant go to school sometimes. Its a killer...|`|acW9uiJZaa	Just wait for it, it will eventually happen. Don't be too excited about it. Trust me, it's not s fun as it may sound.|`|wNXq55tWaa	okay not to be mean but didn't you ask this the other day??? you should be getting it soon because of your discharge and in the mean time just try not to thing of it that much, you'll get it when you get it. and you should be getting a little of your curves when you start, i did.|`|cINoLQMLaa	Yeah, so you want it now, but once you get it you'll hate it.  You really have conversations with your friends about pads, and stuff?  Wow, me and my friends never talk about that stuff...Thank gosh.|`|opUngk8waa	ok firstly getting your period is not going to automatically transform you into looking like a woman, not at all.  So get that out of your head right now.  second, if your friends are bragging about having their periods then chances are they aren't really getting them and they just want to seem more mature and older.  there are a lot of teens who don't start their period until they are almost 16!  so you aren't not normal or anything.  but enjoy being young and looking young because once you start to grow up, you will want your youth back!  Periods aren't fun and certainly aren't worth wanting just to "fit in"  .   That's ridiculous.  They hurt and smell and ruin plans all the time !!!  Seriously, don't be in a hurry at all to grow up.  I wish I was still a kid.|`|T9s9PxhEaa	i'm gunna let u know right now.... i personally really wanted my period, but, once i got it i found it actually sucks big time, its just another inconvenience us women have to live with, trust me 14 sound like a good time to get it.|`|4KNZ0xefaa	ik i felt so jealous of the 8-13 year olds that have periods. the 8 year olds that get periods have worse adult lives, though.     "Isolated sexual precocity of unknown etiology carries no increased risk of mortality; however, distinguishing between children with idiopathic CPP and the rare patient with a CNS, adrenal, or ovarian tumor is important because the latter group may be at risk for tumor-related complications. Some, but not all, studies have found an association between early puberty in girls and a higher risk of breast cancer.    Children with precocious puberty may be stressed because of physical and hormonal changes they are too young to understand. They may be teased by their peers because of their physical difference. Girls who reach menarche before age 9-10 may become withdrawn and may have difficulty adjusting to wearing and changing pads. Both sexes, but more so boys than girls, may have increases in libido leading to increased masturbation or inappropriate sexual behaviors at a young age. Girls with a history of early puberty have a slightly earlier age of initiation of sexual activity.    Some studies have found that children with precocious puberty more frequently exhibit behavioral problems and are less socially competent than age-matched peers. Some, but not all, studies find evidence of emotional problems persisting into adulthood. The distress associated with early menses can be decreased if parents are encouraged to prepare their daughters for this event when they reach stage III-IV of breast development.    Early puberty accelerates growth. These children may initially be considerably taller than their peers. Because bone maturation is also accelerated, growth may be completed at an unusually early age, resulting in short stature. Short stature is more likely if puberty starts very early (ie, before age 5 y) than if it begins moderately early (ie, ages 5-8 y). Several studies show that most untreated girls with idiopathic CPP reach an adult height within the reference range. Determination of bone age can be used to predict adult height and to select patients with high risk for short stature if left untreated."    yeah its long but read that ^      for the friend thing i would just go along with it and make up a date. lol be like oh yeah i just finished. nobodys gonna keep track lol.     maybe you can get new bras or something that make your boobs look fuller, too!      hope i helpedd:D

I don't know what else to tell you about it. I did see a patient whose bp was 45/19 at one point. They gave her a blood transfusion they were able to get it back up though.  Did they get it back up? I'm so sorry that you're going through all this.    It's good to hear it went back up. I mean that blood pressure is bad, but it's not any worse than any of the other things she's been going through. When her urine output starts to go down, that's usually a sign that her body is winding down and it's nearer to the end.  Let me know if you have any other questions or need anything.

hBRnDAr5aa	If you are worried about your calorie intake and not sure if it is working, check out this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.discover-diet-secrets.com/index.php/the-calorie-shifting-diet-secret/" rel="nofollow">http://www.discover-diet-secrets.com/ind...</a><br>  <br>  The calorie shifting diet has worked for a lot of people.|`|kgNkuNOJaa	exercise...eat healthy...better no carbohydrates...consil a coach in a gym.|`|VZIPRJ3eaa	Your body needs a specific amount of calories every day to function.  This is called your BMI or Body Mass Index.  That will tell you the amount of calories you need for every day living... BEFORE doing any exercising.  It's just the normal amount of calories your body needs for breathing, walking, respiratory functions, etc...Charts and calculators to determine your BMI are easily found on most health and diet sites.   <br>   <br>  If you exercise too, you have to add the calories burned by that exercise your BMI total.  This is the new total calories your body is using everyday.  You can calculate your BMI, including exercise, here:<br>  <a href="http://thebestwaytolosefat.com/calc/" rel="nofollow">http://thebestwaytolosefat.com/calc/</a><br>  <br>  Now...  when it comes to losing weight, there are 2 ways to do it:<br>  1*)  I just want to lose weight.. I don't care what kind, I just want to see the scale go down.<br>  2**)  I want to lose fat and only fat.  I don't want to lose muscle.  <br>  <br>  1*)  Losing weight is much easier than just losing fat, but for many people, this is still their primary goal.. especially very obese people.  They just want the scale to drop.  If that's your goal, I would strongly suggest the Weight Watchers diet over all other diets.  It's very effective, easy to do, and proven to be the best overall "lose weight" diet around, over all others.  It even won the "Diet Face-Off" at livestrong.com, when all weight loss diets were competing against each other. Read more here:  <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/diet-face-off/" rel="nofollow">http://www.livestrong.com/diet-face-off/</a> <br>  <br>  2**)  Losing fat only is much tougher, but..  it's the ideal way to lose weight.  Any time you lose weight, you can only lose muscle, fat or both (water too.. but that's not true weight).  With most "diets", you are going to lose as much muscle as fat, and usually more.  Losing "fat only" is what you want to do if you're trying to look the best you can for the pool this summer.  You definitely want to keep all the muscle you can.  Think about 2 guys.. both 5'11 and 180.  One has a belly with fat and the other, exact same height and weight, is ripped, with abs and looks like a walking anatomy chart.  His goal has been to lose fat.. not weight.  The best 2 diets for this are 'Body For Life' (<a href="http://bodyforlife.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://bodyforlife.com/)</a> and 'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' (<a href="http://www.burnthefat.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.burnthefat.com/).</a>  Both will yield results at burning fat only.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is the better of the two.. as it will even demonstrate how to add muscle while burning fat.. the true secret to getting "ripped"!  'Body For Life' can be found at any bookstore.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is available online only.  It's a 340 page pdf document created by bodybuilder Tom Venudo (who has only 4% bodyfat and is over 40 years old!).  They also have a great member site that you can join for $10 a month here:  <a href="http://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com</a> .  Tom answers your questions himself on that site.. instead of other sites that just give you a host of all the other members offering advice.  Both of the diets encourage the same.. eating 6 meals a day (females can opt for 5) and cardio several times a week.  Body For Life is a little more geared toward fat burning only though.  You won't gain much muscle.. but if you have  muscle already, you can rip up very nicely.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is the most work for sure, but will yield the most impressive results of any diet on the market today.  <br>  <br>  Why so many meals a day?  Your body needs a continual supply of glycogen for energy.  Eating every 3 hours, the food is digested and directed into cells requiring energy right then.  Once the cells have received all the energy they need, the body stores the extra glycogen in your muscles and liver.  However, there's only so mcuh glycogen your body can store.  Eating more than you should at any one meal makes extra glycogen now convert to fat.  This is why you have to know exactly how many calories you need every day.. and why it's so important to eat the right amount at every meal.  Remember.. 1 pound of fat, is just 3500 extra calories that your body stores.  It doesn't take long to put an extra 3500 calories in your body.  <br>  <br>  What if I eat a lot less so my body can't store the extra calories as fat?  Even worse.. your body is smart enough to realize that it doesn't have enough calories it needs for the day (your BMI) and to compensate, it slows down your metabolism, so it doesn't burn calories as fast.  And.. anytime your body is in this fasted state, it takes emergency precautions.  It tries to hang on to energy as long as possible, so it quits burning fat for energy altogether and starts tearing your muscles down for energy.  Muscle is anabolically active tissue, so this is the easiest place for your body to get needed energy.  If you do this day after day, you will become sluggish and tired from a slow metabolism and your body will lose most of its weight from muscle.  Some fat will get burned this way too.. but it's the last to go!  Your body will start breaking fat down last, after it has
zblFCh7Paa	I Agree what does this have to do with mental health?|`|5LR1RZelaa	Is there a question somewhere here?
kwYxQp0Maa	Well it is most likely not broken, if you broke your ankle, which would actually be the bottoms of the two lower leg bones, you probably wouldn't be able to walk on it.  It could be a minor break, like a hairline in which case you also probably sprain it and the sprain could be the worse injury.  Ice it.  20 mins on 20 mins. off.  Keep it elevated.  take some Ibuprofen and hope for the best.  If there isn't some improvement in a couple of days, see a doc.  Keep off it as much as possible and if you have to be on it, get some type of ankle support.  An aircast is best but a ace bandage will help.  Don't be surprised if it turns black and blue.|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	Sounds like a sprain. I have had so many I don't even remember.  Ice is for 20 mins and then let it be for 20 mins. Keep doing that for an hour maybe. Stay off of it. In the morning after you sleep and wake up it will KILL to walk on beacuse it was still all night. They pain will go away as you walk on it. Just take it easy for a few days and be sure to ice it whenever you get the chance and elevate it!
bQ4RAi07aa	Do you feel a single, soft lump? A hernia can form in vaious sites in the body, but mostly occur in the groin, when it is called an inguinal hernia. In this case, a weakness, in the muscular wall of the abdomen allows a loop of intestine to push into the groin. Pain is caused as the weak muscle fibres are pushed open and stretretched still further and there is also a distinct bulge that can vary in size from quite tiny to several inches in diameter.     Is pain worse if you draw up your knee?   Few muscle strains are more likely to put a professional sportsman out of action than a groin strain. The muscles and tendons affected run underneath the inguinal ligament and allow you to bring your thigh up against the abdomen     Is your urine bloodstained?   The passage of the kidney stone, however small, from the kidney down the draining tube ( the ureter) to the bladder can produce pain anywhere in the loin and the front of the abdomen, right down into the groin and the testicles on the affected side. The pain is usually excruciatingly sharp and often associated with bloodstained urine.    Always check with iyour dr on health advice.
ubaKx0VXaa	i kno when i eat runny egg its like that to >:OOO
ZCLbrSRlaa	She's probably just getting her period. If she never got it before, this is just her bodies way of showing her its coming. This happened to me too like 3 weeks before I got mine. No worries.|`|hbg16yqdaa	maybe that person has a STD so i would check a OBGYN|`|kmUUXzmRaa	Sometimes when your period might come within the next few months you will bleed just a little bit. It doesn't necessarily mean anything.|`|OOUmcHXEaa	It could just be her period.   Sorry that its such a plain answer.  Sometimes you don't always get PMS before a period and she had a light period.  Or it could just be some sort of phenominon.|`|XVjFBfQsaa	it could be the start of her period not all periods have cramps off the bat. It just depends and not all people are the same i dont think you two have anything to worry about it.|`|XgwGxdb3aa	it is probably her period starting. you can start by getting her supplies she needs like pads. and eventually she will have to tell her mom.
KaAXJJo8aa	yes... could be a sign of herpes...|`|8j7FCEOraa	Did you shave?  Very likely its just razor burn.  Irritated hair follicles    Or, you could be having an allergic reaction to harsh laundry detergent or clothes softener.    I wouldnt over-react. Just book a doc's appointment to be sure.|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	herpes. but it can b genetics.|`|xthjbUg2aa	yep!!! i know what you did last night!!!      muahahahahaha|`|TfLPRwFWaa	more detail    it could be a cold sore or blister|`|rkkIyPoQaa	Herpes. Don't fret though... If you've ever heard a friend or relative complain about cold sores on their mouth, they have herpes! 9 of 10 people have it, and it's not usually a big issue unless you have them on your genitals. Even then, some people don't get painful, obvious outbreaks. Sometimes it's barely noticeable and it's easily treated with medication (nontopical too - meaning you can take pills for this).    Ahhh.... Herpes...|`|8vwEWq2Zaa	Yes! or Herpis|`|5MxYOnzdaa	IT COULD... get it checked for sure if its really really bugging you    otherwise it could also just be cold sores... look up some pics via google and compare. good luck.|`|GEP0e4fqaa	the most likely could be the STD herpes, in the form of a oral virus called herpes simplex, or more commonly as a coldsore.  if you felt a tingling feeling and part of your lip has turned into a blister then this is probably what it is. in about a week it will turn into a scab, and then disappear. if you pick it, it will scar.  do not kiss anyone while you have this, as it is very contagious!  i would advise buying a coldsore cream such as blistex, or zovirax. and also purchase the amino acid lysine from a chemist. it helps lessen the severity of coldsores. the packaging recommends two daily, but i usually take about five and there are no side effects. good luck. and for your sake, i hope it isnt a coldsore, because they are a massive pain!
AA11530601	oh dear that sounds like a bad one.Yes you could be in danger. Im sorry you only tried to help him and now you have a complete stalker on your hands. I would probably try and get a restraining order or tell him you will get have to get one if he dosent stop. The baby idea only appeals to him because that would be one way he would get to have more control over you and he thinks that would be he gets to keep you and no one else can have you. I would be pretty worried he, he could just be saying hell committ sucide as a way of scaring you, but either way you cant make it your responsibility. If he does it, it will be because of all the other things wrong in his life and not because of anything you said or did, but i think he is just making a desperate attempt to scare you into not breaking off contact with him. A friend of mine from a while ago had a guy who was saying that,and she still dumped him and he never went through with it, he was just acting like a manipulative drama queen. This guy sounds pretty manipulative controlling and possessive too. Calling any one 15 times a day is controlling cause hes getting far far to overinvolved in the minor details of your life and is interrupting your personal time and making it all about him.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Please get away from him and call the police!|`|caddYdDjaa	if yor most likley in danger considering hes stalking you and talks about sucide it would be smart to call the police|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Write down what he's said, including the threats and take them to the school counselor, your teacher or the principal.    This boy is SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL AND DANGEROUS!!!!  You have to TELL SOMEONE to protect yourself and get him help!!!!    PLEASE, TELL SOMEONE ABOUT THIS BOY - HE'S IN DESPERATE TROUBLE!!!|`|fe16876db70eb19623aadb9b18c2358eaa	of course you should get a mental health professional involved IMMEDIATLY. You need an intervention, and I think you are in over your head. So call I MEAN TONIGHT, call the emergency mental health crisis line, because if what you describe is true, you cannot wait until he contacts you.    You have a good heart, good motivation. Help this guy get the help he really needs.|`|NJLKLeeZaa	Alright, evaluate and go over the facts. When did this start, are you in close proximity with this guy at all (is he neighbor, colleague, classmate etc) is he serious, does he take very invasive measures, etc. If you find this really paranoid, keep records of all phone calls, times that he visits, etc, get your boyfriend to act as witness to this so if it continues and does not stop anytime soon, report to the police (or let them know about this incident right now [tell them not to take action but let them know]) and if situation persists, get a restraining order. Something is definitely wrong. The guy is being too possessive, he is threatening your own safety and is pushing the privacy boundary by stalking you. My advice is to take some defensive actions immediately ie by telling this to your parents, his relatives (if you know them) so they know what is going on (but don't take any drastic measures towards that guy ie, direct confrontation because anger may instigate some violent reactions). Whatever happens, safety is first priority     Hope this was help to some degree.

And no your skin tissue in your mouth gets burned and that why your breath sticks, also the chemicals will stay around for a while in your tissues and teeth.|`|9YGggx8Uaa	Quite smoking that's the smart thing to do!|`|PlEEZTRsaa	Brush your teeth and rinse your nostrils out with slighlty warm water (Sniff in the water in each nostril,blow nose after each time,it will burn a tad,but it's worth it.)

QsD9VOMYaa	Well I was 14 yo in grade 9.  I always hated using public toilets, and when at school I would always hold it till I got home to go to the bathroom.  I was at school one day and my friend said that she needed to go to the bathroom, and she asked me to come with her, at first I hesitated, but then she said that she didnt want to go on her own so I agreed to go with her.  When we went to the girls toilets, our principle had covered the girls toilet windows with black cloths to prevent the builders at our school from looking in, so it was really dark when we went.  I remember sitting down on the toilet, and as I got up to pull my pants up I 'thought' i saw brown stuff but wasn't sure cause it was too dark.  When my friend came out she asked me if I was alright (cause I looked as white as a ghost lol), and I told her that I think that I have started my periods but am not sure.   So I dicided to go back to the bathroom and have another look, and again found it hard to see as it was soo dark, but was pretty sure that I had. I had pads in my bag but didnt know how to use one, so I waited till I got home, and I told my mum and she was all happy LOL.    So thats how I got my period (tried to include every detail lol)|`|CS3W706xaa	i got my priod when i was 11 and i called my mom and said i got it i started crying caz i wasnt ready for it well i knew i was going to get it in a month but never thought it would come so...............|`|SvQ5ZhjJaa	i really didnt expect it coming.  i was about to leave for school and i went to the bathroom and my underwear was bloody.  you should be having discharge.|`|uiAUQPjUaa	geez.. umm....i was watching this movie with my mom in our basement and went to the bathroom and saw little red/brown marks all over my underwear. i was freaked out but i kept it from my mom. then the next morning i woke up to my underwear full of blood. i was mortified but just put on a pad.  my first period was actually not bad compared to others  i was 13|`|u25R7XIGaa	13, 8th grade; night before my discharge was a bit brownish but then it stopped, then started again about twelve hours later at school. It was pretty slow so it didn't leak through my pants during class or anything and I had time to go to a bathroom; I'd been carrying pads around for a while so I just used one. From then on out the only thing that was different from how I handle it now was that I was waaay more self-concious and changed the pad much more often than necessary.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Well, I was like 9 and in 4th or 5th grade, and I thought I had crapped myself, and after two days I was like 'oh dang, I know what this is' and I went to my mom and was like "I think I started my period" and started crying lol. And she gave me some pads, and that was that. It was sooo embarressing, cause I was never close to my mom and it felt very extremely awkward telling that to her.|`|s0XxPDHbaa	Well, I was 11 & I was at my best friends birthday party and all of our friends were there. I went to the bathroom and saw a red spot and didnt think anything of it. An hour later I had my period & My mom had to come give me pads! It was so embarrasing.|`|wQHAM1Fwaa	haha i got mine in the summer when i was 14. i was on a cruise boat at the time with my family and i was alone in our room watching tv, and i was wearing white shorts. i looked down and saw brown stuff (gross, i know.) i was kinda mad because i couldnt go swimming for the rest of the trip, but it wasant too bad because there was just 2 days left lol. i was in a pretty bad mood during the vacation, and i was happy that i got my period then because i knew why i was in sucha bad mood.   :]|`|bd7qDDGPaa	I am 13, I got it a couple months ago on a friday, I woke up and walla. It took me 2 days to tell my mom for some reason i was scared. Also I had my fist swim team practice and I didnt know how to use a tampon.  I just learned how.|`|4YaIXAhQaa	I was 11 and it was like the week before school started. It was my last year at a child care center and we had just gotten back from a trip to the zoo. I remember my stomach felt weird and then I felt something sticky in my underwear. My mother had already told me about this stuff a couple of years before so I was pretty sure. I went to the bathroom, saw the brown stain and got one of the teachers and they gave me a pad. No big deal. I told my mom and we got pads on the way home. I only had it for about 5 days and then it went away. I went about two months without having it (you are irregular for a few years) and then i had it for a few months and then so on until it became regular.
V2hv7W98aa	i have read something also. i think you have to drink 4-5 cups a day, or its 5-6...i know its one of them. i love green tea, i drink it almost everyday. ever since i started drinking it i felt better (healthily wise).    and i add some sugar to mine. i personally think green tea by itself tastes alittle weird. and i don't think it will do anything.|`|NH6mWUGlaa	I love green tea. It is like the best anti-deoxant drink i can imagine. I wrestle so whenever i eat i would drink this magic stuff to help refresh and clean my system. and no adding sugar or lemon to green tea wont change, besides the flavor :O|`|7810b482021aa21d7006247d38601648aa	green tea has been found to be very beneficial. if you dont like drinking green tea then go to your local health food store (gnc) and buy a green tea supplement. kyolic with green tea is a good choice.  suki
q8KJU5eWaa	sit-ups and crunches. side crunches are really good for love handles. lay on your right side with your left hand under your head supporting it and as you crunch up, bring your knees up towards your head. then repeat on your left side. do about 3 reps of 10 on each side 3-4 days a week if you want to see results. good luck!|`|TAS1vdr9aa	Anything cardio. If you just exercise the muscles, they'll end up looking bigger ! Run, walk, or join a class like cardio-kickboxing.
yg5P4mBlaa	Eat more meals, but smaller ones. And side bends are good for loosing love handles. But cardio helps loose them faster.|`|sYXWRE5waa	For the love handles do side sit ups. And side bends.  \  Just eating a large breakfast and dinner isn't going to make anyone lose weight.  They'd actually lose more weight if they ate five or six small meals.  Eating throughout the day builds up your metabolism.  Only eating once or twice slows it dramatically.|`|z6fF9Fsoaa	I would go for eating balanced meals all day with breakfast being a little larger. Make sure it's healthy food too. Also, try doing sit-ups and exercises that work your abs. Oh and do side planks (where you have your elbow and sides of your feet touching the ground only and your laying on your side)
JwecpnBVaa	No, thats a very common misconception.  When you workout, it burns the fat off of your body thus revealing muscles you may have had hiding beneath the layer of fat, you also build more muscles. There is no transfer from fat to muscle, only replacements. :D|`|7RGtUnQJaa	lol, fat doesn't turn into muscle.. but if you work out.. your fat burns away and you gain muscle.. not from the fat though =p|`|oa3Y7Xltaa	Here's the simple answer.

That is like saying apples will turn into oranges if they are in the same pale. Lean muscle burns fat so the more lean muscle you have in your body, the leaner you will become.

hL4nWbzmaa	How to avoid porn addiction on the Internet    1. Consider installing porn content filtering software( Strongly Recommend NetDog ,you can get it from www.netdogsoft.com ) on your computer. it will help to protect you from stumbling into pornography by accident, That's important.    2. Do not try to guess what the address of a Web page is. Many pornographic sites have similar addresses of respectable sites. For example www . whitehouse . com is a porn site. The real address is www. whitehouse . gov    3. Never click on Web site addresses that you receive in an unsolicited email.    4. Do not open attachments that come in email that are unsolicited.    5. Use filtered search engines or reputable directories to find the information you need.    6. Do not search for terms like girls. Think before you enter a search term.      Stick with reputable sites.  If something looks questionable, don't let curiosity get the best of you. Delete it or close the window.

If you eat fruits and veggies for a snack and during meals, and make sure you get lean protien and fiber you needen't worry. Avoid refined sugar and refined carbs (such as white bread, white rice, etc). oh, if you are famished, grab a small handful of cashews or almonds. and ALWAYS eat breakfast, b/c your body will store fat if it is starved. Steel cut oats are great, a hard boiled egg, and acording to macrobiotics miso (a fermented form of soy) soup is a fine choice! Grapefruits and oranges are great breakfast foods (b/c you have the fiber which fills you up, unlike juice which is just the sugary part). good luck, and if these feelings persist seek help from a psychologist. x0x.|`|HrycUpKSaa	you are fine!|`|pi6SKF16aa	your perfecttt  but post a picture on like photobucket for me to seee  im no perv dont worry  lol  im just curiousss|`|r9gBoBLCaa	Keep not eating?!

DuJcBhvtaa	Most arm exercises (ie. pull-ups, chin-ups, wight lifting) build chest muscles. don't go for the man-like muscles, just tone your arms and your stomach and your brest size may go up.Plus, muscles  consume more calories.     you have to like the body you have, and realize that it's a gift.

2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	Everyone is different, but what makes you think she isn't faking it herself?  The normal orgasm in most cases only lasts for less than 30 seconds.  However much pleasure can be had in the leading up to it.  And many women are capable of having more than one orgasm at a time, but there is usually some time between each one, like several minutes.

Or maybe you are not a full lesbian. Or maybe you need to try different ways to do things with her. If you two are in a relationship you should be able to talk to her about it.

UKHDlvM5aa	Yes, of course. But it's not possible to gain muscle without any exercise. You don't have to go to the gym to do strength training - you can do exercises at home using free weights (can be expensive and consumes space) or resistance bands (cheap and easy to store). But you won't be able to gain any muscle without putting in the work. Even athletes who abuse steroids still have to work out to make their muscles bigger.|`|7i9ncEBdaa	I saw this thing on this documentary about how you can control your body with your brain. They took half a group of people and had them exercise three times a week; the other half watched the others and thought about doing what the others were. Since so much stuff happens in the brain, all this thinking alone made their brain react as if they were actually exercising. So, their muscle mass grew. About five percent more than the people that actually exercised.  You can exercise at home, of course, lifting stuff or walking around the block....    But other than that, in theory, yes.|`|MyKyEJUvaa	of course|`|xqOWI8VUaa	Working out at home.

Weight can change the size as well.  Please be more explicit with your question.|`|yVRpdx5laa	not if your building muscle underneath. a 34D is equivalent to a 36C so its similar you just decreased your bandwidth. try a 36C it will probably look fine too. i used to measure people all the time at Victoria's Secret    have you been measured lately?   or just try on any bra. it depends on the bra and where you get it from.    they might just be bigger because you arent as wide.. thus they stick out more. same as a waist people can loose inches in their waste but keep fat on their stomach.. it will even up and congrats on the weight loss keep it up :)|`|kvsdv19Naa	I think it's a question of relativity.  The cup size is the difference between the fullest part of the breast and the band size (measured under the breasts, then add 4--5").  Maybe your breasts are more or less the same size, but the band size went down, so there's an "increase" in cup size?
ku6DEIhOaa	I used to have this exact same problem!  It went on for a few years, but doesn't happen all that often anymore.  I know how you feel, it's quite gross.  And I often got a sore throat soon after one fell out.  But with all the research that I've done on the subject, and talked to doctors as well, apparently it is normal.  They are called "Tonsil Stones".  And it will get better over time as your tonsils get smaller.    This may help you understand better, sorry it's so long:      "The situation you describe, Alice, is a very common one. The tonsils usually appear like small, dimpled golf balls set on either side of the back of the throat. Children with large tonsils and deep crypts often do get food particles trapped in there. Because saliva contains digestive enzymes, trapped food begins to break down. Particularly, the starch or carbohydrate part of the food melts away, leaving firmer, harder remains of food in the tonsils. This does not look like the food that went into the mouth.    As you suspect, however, there is more to these hard lumps than just food. The tonsils also trap other mouth debris such as bacteria and old cells from the surface of the mouth's lining. Some of these cells contain small amounts of keratin, the same substance found in fingernails and rhinoceros horns. Whatever the nature of the debris, it is then attacked by white blood cells. The aftermath of this battle leaves the crevices of the tonsil strewn with hardened remains.    Most people swallow this material without ever noticing it, while it is still tiny. In those whose tonsils are large, however, the particles can lodge in the deep crypts, where they continue to grow. The enlarging lumps are called calculi of the tonsil, or tonsilloliths (tonsil stones). These stones are most common during adolescence.    Microscopic studies of these tonsilloliths have shown them to contain a combination of food particles, bacteria, oral debris, and white blood cells in a concentrically laminated pattern -- rather like a pearl. Usually they are small gritty particles found in the center of soft, cheesy flecks. Sometimes, however, they become quite large, appearing as rough, yellow or gray, round stones. At times they reach an extraordinary size. Affected people usually have a history of repeated attacks of tonsillitis in earlier years.    Most people with calculi of the tonsils have no associated symptoms. In that case nothing need be done, except perhaps for brushing or scraping them out, as your daughter does. Gargling, refraining from eating during the 30 minutes before falling asleep, and careful oral hygiene may help minimize their formation.    For some people, however, the calculi can be quite bothersome, causing a constant foreign-body sensation, a chronic low-grade sore throat, recurrent episodes of tonsillitis persisting beyond childhood, or chronic bad breath.    Treatment consists of either removing the tonsils or removing the calculi. Troublesome large calculi that are not easily dislodged may need an ear, nose, and throat doctor to remove them.    Not too long ago, tonsils were routinely removed for the sole crime of being swollen and inflamed. We didn't understand, then, that the tonsils purposely accept the infections to prevent the organisms from traveling deeper, and to show the invaders to the developing immune system to train it for the future. The tonsils are selfless protectors. As a child becomes an adult, the tonsils usually begin to shrink; the watchful guardians of childhood are no longer much-needed.    Tonsils are a bit like parents: looming large early in life, diminishing over time, ever-protecting, ever-teaching, but sometimes with rough or hard spots when we let things build up ;^)"|`|zwh9ELMIaa	Tonsillitis
CciXZNYraa	Well, what's your height and weight?  But anyways, if you want to lose weight, do it the right and healthy way.  Here are a few tips;    WHEN to eat for losing weight...     ? Eat (at least) three times a day.   Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course)   ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try.   OK, one apple after 18:00   ? Don't starve   Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health.   Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet.   ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.    WHAT to drink for losing weight...     ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day !   Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water!   This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks!   Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys.   ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed!   Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions.   ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.    Exercise for losing weight...     ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good.   ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts...   I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss...   ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants!   ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.        Good luck!|`|uiIVD8ssaa	Oh no! If you're going through a growth spurt you should NOT for any reason be TRYING to lose weight! Please don't!! What you should be doing is eating lots of healthy foods (eat when you feel hungry, as normal people should) if you starve yourself you could end up stunting your growth.......  Running, on the other hand, is a very good idea. It's good to get lots of exercise, just don't go crazy and get addicted to exercise. Running and eating healthily should keep you a good weigh, and you'll be happier if you're healthier. Good luck! :)  PS. the taller you grow the more weight you can put on later without being fat. So make sure you don't stunt your growth now, it would be kicking your self in the foot for later.|`|e28ef20545f237d650432879a6f3044faa	If you want to lose weight, then by all means do so. Only you know if you need to or not. Your friends were correct in what they told you. I would also like to add tho that on  3 losing weight fast will also put strain on the body which isnt good and could lead to more health issues. If you want to lose weight, then do it by eating healthier, eat small portions regularly.  3 big meals a day isnt good.. small portions help keep your metabolism regular. for example, breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner but small portions like I said. This will help speed up your metabolism so your body doesnt go into fasting where it stores fat because it doesnt know when or if its getting the next meal. You have to regulate it. Also exercise regularly. Not particularly running, but any type of exercise, Could be playing a sport... just something where your moving around and not just sitting there. Hope this helps.|`|AA11967630	First of all no magic diet pill will do anything good in the term. Cardio will be your best weapon against the battle of the bulge. As for a proper diet I would book an appointment with your doctor and get a ref feral to a dietitian who can give you a general layout of foods to avoid and load upon. I am on a program right now called U weight loss though it is only in Canada so far and they are very new I have heard nothing but good things. I have been with the program for a week and I have lost 6 pounds. My friend lost 40 in 2 months and has kept it off with no effort 5 months later..she looks amazing. They focus on 3 main things..diet, water intake and excersise. I also take multivitamins. Oh and they stress I should never skip breakfast, never eat pork, and stay away from all transfat and deep fried foods.

It's a hard thing to do.|`|ppKQEhEMaa	If your having trouble, use an applicator.|`|V2PDiV9Uaa	A few tips based on experience: Use a tampon with a plastic applicator (outer covering) as it slides in much easier, get a lower absorption tampon that's not huge (slim or regular) when you're just starting out using tampons and aim toward your backbone when inserting. Also, make sure you push it far enough up and that you remove the applicator after you've got it in. Only the little cotton plug with the string hanging out the end should be left inside you. The cardboard/plastic tubes go in the trash. The illustration on the instructions always crack me up...looks like they're striking a Captain Morgan pose.|`|8WYFLp1Baa	angle it towards your back when you put it in.|`|qttFnNz7aa	check this website ...it really helps     http://www.beinggirl.ca/en_CA/pages/good...        it will def  help you!|`|dZ1efw1Paa	yeah, ik, i've had my period for about three or four years and i just started using tampons.  i got lubricating gel. you can get it at the grocery store. put it all over the tampon and then put it in slowly. always works and it doesn't hurt at all!  oh and playtex are the best. i tried the tampax ones and they hurt soo bad, even with the gel because of the top.   good luck!|`|wNXq55tWaa	you're probably just angling it wrong try it straight up|`|pDkJeELFaa	I agree with sara and it takes a little time to get used to putting it in.

Once that happens, use your index finger to push the lower skinny part, with the strings hanging out, untill it runs into the top half. Ta-da!|`|BQpQewOAaa	It is not supposed to sting if you are doing it the right way.  Ok, you have the part that holds the tampon, and you have the pusher.  On the part that holds the tampon, there is a little rigid area at the end of it.  You insert that part up to the ridge..... you should hold the ridged part with your fingers so you don't go too far.  Once you have it in that far, you push the pusher part into the part that has the tampon in it.  The pusher will push the tampon part futher into your body.  Then holding the same riged part, you pull out the casing ( thats the part that holds the tampon, and the pusher ).  The string will still be hanging outside your body.  If you do it right, you won't feel it.  Hope this helps.|`|QA62m6Y7aa	try getting the outside of it wet with like your spit or something before you put it in, maybe it stings because its dry and not sliding in nicely.|`|NqwIt8Tyaa	I had the same problem , most people do !  When you go to put it in go till your finger tips touch your skin. then you push with your finger to put it in , you have to put it deep enough. if you don't "feel" it its ok , if you feel it , try again.  ask your mom for help as well don't be shy , better safe then sorry !    Hope it helped!  Jessica|`|4KNZ0xefaa	hmm. id say:  a. the tampon is too big, get a smaller size.  b. maybe you cut yourself while putting it in so it stings?    talk to your mom!
029dfd57698be0abbf06b24b24c17c53aa	Hydration, exercise, and a healthy weight are the best ways to prevent them. Once you have them, they will either go away on their own (rarely) or they are there for life. There are surgeries that you can have done to return them to deeper recesses of the skin, but to do this on a large part of your body would be very expensive.     Just try to stay healthy. Some families are just prone to them, so don't feel too bad. It's not your fault if your genetic material is just a little different.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	There is no way outside of surgery to make vericose veins disappear.

avykSnJMaa	Probably now a days everyone has it lol no big deal|`|6nDqvtwbaa	Sounds to me like you're ADHD type...I was exactly like this in high school, too.    Here is a very official set of criteria to maybe persuade your mom with:http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/symptom.h...    Stimulants can help you to focus but they do have their problems, too.    :P  Not everyone has it!  The scientific figure is 1 in 20 people are adhd.      Feel free to message me or whatever...I've had ADD forever and I'm through college now...be glad to help if I can.|`|RDxhQonWaa	yeah i know wat adhd is cuz i have it and it seems like you have it you arent dumb you just need something to help you pay attention|`|hkvWDU3xaa	If this is a serious question, I would say you might be hyper active, maybe you could use some kind of meds, but I don't know. Ask a doctor about this. I took ritalin, whiched helped , but that **** is not really good it has Amphetamine in it.|`|E70A7aqcaa	You are a  typically undisciplined youth that doesn't realize the incredible value of what you're daydreaming through.  Nowadays they have these great diagnostic labels on such behavior and a drug program to get you to pay attention that is a total failure. I know because I'm a mental health professional with 20+ years experience, now retired, and I've raised two kids through your age, AND, believe it or not, I was your age once, many decades ago.  Do what you want, but you're wasting valuable time, and an incredibly valuable part of your life.  God Bless you.|`|xlSlfApBaa	It sounds more like you have aspergers than adhd. Aspergers is more when your mind has a tendancy to wander. You have small compulsions which seem like nothing to everyone else but you can easily blow a fuse over (mine is that I categorize and alphabetize my books, and when people go to put a book back in the wrong category I lose it, alphabetically I can let slide)  From observing a friends brother of mine who has ADHD, (no offense to the above) he is quite violent and while he doesnt pay attention he has talents that he utilizes, but when asked to concentrate on them he cant and then gets violent with whoever wants ihm to concentrate.  Look up aspergers and ADHD on the internet for more answers.  Oh, and people with aspergers tend to use either one side or the other of their cranium (i.e. they are either creative or logic, barely ever both, or rather they cant do both at the same time and so have a tendancy to switch often in an irratic manner)
TdsJwt3Haa	since you lost muscle and gained fat it doesn't show when you measure yourself, muscle takes up space to, maybe even more than fat because it somewhat holds to fat in place. I get the feeling you didn't gain that much weight, since you only weight 112 pounds, just start working out again to replace some of the fat with muscle, it doesn't matter if you don't lose pounds on the scale, but you will look and feel better about yourself.|`|TFfgskH0aa	I am losing inches and fat numerous place all over my body with a product called Osolean.

In the long run this could be very damaging to your bone. You could set the bone wrong and have the bone re-paste wrong. Then the doctor will have to re-break it and set it and put a cast on it. In the long run this will cost tons more than just having it done by a professional. My friend tried casting herself and ended up spending at least a thousand dollars in the long run. It won't cost a lot. Free clinics do this sort of thing for well, free.   Hope This Helped :)

ETcBRko3aa	I have been hospitalized 5 different times.    I tried to kill myself 3 times and got my stomach pumped and charcoaled.  I then stayed in the hospital for 10 days once and 14 days the other two times.  Then I went to a day treatment program for 2 months after I was released from the hospital.    The other two times I was hospitalized because I went totally manic and the police took me to the hospital.  I was doing some crazy things on top of a building.  The manic times I was only in for 7 days to fix my medications.    I am Bipolar and other stuff.    I don't think that many people goto the hospital for mental illness.|`|hDWaxGgDaa	In 2008 I was hospitalized 4 times for mental illness- a combined total of about 23 days in inpatient, about 3 weeks in day treatment, and I'm currently in outpatient treatment.

C2M2StR1aa	You can't spot reduce fat.  You have to reduce overall body fat and often the fat around the middle is the last to release.  So for your abs to show you have to have a very low percentage of body fat.     I also tell my clients to eat smaller meals more times (5-6) per day. When a body is starved it will store fat. When it believes that times are good (when it's being feed good nutrition often) it will release fat.     I have written a page focusing on a 3 pronged approach dealing with Detoxing, Nutrition and Exercise (especially body weight exercises, which you can do in your home).     www.diet-and-exercise-for-health.com/b...     Good luck and good health!!|`|pFkvTEWuaa	belly fat is a result of high carbs and sugar    You need to cut out carbs, high sugar and soduim foods    eat more protien, veggies, fish,  milk and fiber cereals and greek yogurt|`|8g8zm8jaaa	Put more effort into walking, jogging and dancing. You really need to work yourself, and constantly. A healthy diet is also required.|`|BzuryYy4aa	Do abdomen exercises. You can try out push ups and pull ups. Control food. Try to maintain a balanced diet. Do not eat junk food.|`|1nIeHzofaa	You're missing a big part of why you probably need to lose belly fat - your diet.  I'm not talking about short term, lose weight diets.  You need to change your eating habits forever.  That means a daily routine of foods low in fat and very little or no saturated fat.  Eat lots of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and low fat protein (fish, beans, soy).  Everything you eat should have some positive nutritional benefit.  Then your workouts will begin to pay off.
79d325a9d7089b91075a8438b79efeaeaa	I'm going to tell you the best advice for what you a feeling.    People will see you how you see yourself.  If you walk around with the attitude that nobody should worry about you, that's what you'll get.    Ignore the post/s above, just because other people have issues, doesn't mean yours are unimportant.  Even if people say you're just bunging it on for effect, ignore it.  What you are feeling is real and you need to accept that.  It's ok to feel paranoid about talking to people, I do too...and it's ok to feel scared and angry, but you need to act on it and not let that rule your life.    When you feel blue, you need to first accept the thoughts you have, then everytime they come, force them away and replace them with a positive one.    It's not easy but it is what those people who are positive do without thinking.  Trust me on this one.  You need to rewrite your thoughts with better ones.|`|vLrNlKQoaa	It just sounds like you are having a rough time coping with things that have gone on in your life.  I can't say we have all been there but I have had some similar issues in my life too.  It does not help when you don't have a good support system.  It is hard when you feel like you have a million different emotions going on such as hating everyone and even yourself and I am sure there are many more.... it is hard to not feel like you are crazy when your mind is going a mile a minute and being depressed does not help.  Depression is one of those things that keep you down unless you can pull yourself up.  I don't know how old you are but it might help to go to your family doctor and see if you can talk with them and maybe get on some meds if that is necessary or maybe you can try some alternative things such as meditation.  If you don't know alot about meditation you can do a search on yahoo.  I have used meditation myself and self talk, such as hypnosis to pull myself out.  Like I said, I don't know a lot about what is really going on or what the basis of your emotions are.  It might help to get to the root of the problem, which is necessary when trying to figure things out so then you can understand what is going on. ie: you hate everyone because......  if you write, write it down, if you do art... express it there.  I hope this helps but I do suggest that you you find someone to confide in and see about getting some help.  Sometimes this is just something genetic or organic that needs to be corrected with meds and it is NOT your fault, remember that... good luck  :)|`|yBBuE0v7aa	The problem with you is that your a failure?

FXBIx0Ubaa	Depression is hard to recover from, usually you never fully recover. The hardest yet easiest thing to do is positive thinking. Try making a list of great things about yourself, take your time. Before you go to bed and before you get out of bed read them out loud to yourself. I know this sound hard and kind of weird but give it a try. You need to believe in yourself before anyone else believes in you. Plus if they are truly your friends they will support you and not make fun of you for a problem that is hard to control.

A5Mirunmaa	well when you do orgasm your but tighten take a air brush and use the handle and gently slide it in your butt.it may sound stupid but it works|`|OP4O5mjnaa	first and foremost, women need to know what it takes for them to have an orgasm, because each and every girl is different. so you might want to try giving one to yourself, if you havent already (use a vibrator, or the like) then, make sure the foreplay is long enough that you are excited enough. Internal orgasms are very difficult to have, focus on clitoral ones at first....and if you already know all this...turn up the speed on your vibrator=faster orgasm|`|1NWjta2jaa	Read a good book, if you are bored.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	A vibrator can usually bring one on very quickly.  But what's the rush?  Enjoy the journey!
906499f6cdaab2cb13e30cf4b392edf7aa	I think the pill can be a definite issue. Ask your obj to change it and see the libido difference. Also some scented warming oils and lubricants can do wonders.    Get very close to each other, hug and kiss for a few weeks. Get your head off the orgasm thing. Let him caress you, not necessarily on intimate parts at first. Relax together, being naked together, hug but don't make love. Re-discover each other, don't wash yourself too much both of you, just feel each other smell. Tell each other how you like each other very often.    Then start reading some erotic stories together and don't be shy in asking what type of story you like, any detail, even if not realistic, ask for it. Even if it involves other people with the two of you in the imagination.  Then as you feel more and more aroused, teach him how to touch you and kiss you intimately till you climax. Use your hand to guide his, make him touch the area inside you immediately underneath your clitoris. Once this works, talk about it. And then make love, but please ask him to spend at least 20 minutes or so kissing you there before entering. As he makes love to you, if it doesn't bother you, ask him to caress the anus, entering just a little with a lubricated finger. Talk loud about your fantasies both of you while making love: a few "special, maybe dirty" words can do miracles that physical attributes cannot even get close to. Try, you are just stuck. If it doesn't work, see if a stronger stimulation, using toys (there are many now not vulgar at all) may help. And do that with the knowledge that all is fair in bed, no jealousies or insecurities allowed if there's respect for ea. other. Good luck and good O :)|`|AA10261043	Are you taking any antidpressants like Prozac, Zoloft, or Lexapro?  It could be some med you are taking.  When I was taking Prozac, it took FOREVER to climax and that was even  IF I was in the mood...which was very rarely!|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I hate to be gross, but you should learn how to masturbate.  Then you'll know what it takes to heat you up to the boiling point.  Just try different things until it works.  Here's a hint- everything you try is not just about the physical.  It's also about what you're thinking about while you do it.  Maybe there are books that could give you ideas.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	You should have started the pills during your period, either on Sunday or on the first day of your period.  Why did you skip two pills and then take one on Tuesday?  If you started during the month and after the end of you period, you would not be safe until you have another period and then start the pills during that period.  If you don't start during your period, you can't be sure that you have not ovulated.  You may be okay, but I don't understand why you didn't just start taking them on Sunday and take them all.    good luck..
DoVk82oiaa	My favourite way to orgasm is to get some lubricant, lay on the bed, put a dot of the vaseline on my clitoris and first rub slowly, then as it starts to feel good, increase the speed and intensity. As you do it more and more often, you will begin to master some of the techniques that make it such an amazingly spiritually fulfilling experience... Such as when you can hold off until you want to orgasm; or keep on having orgasms until you have had enough to satisfy.    For me, sometimes I like to take some time out for me, and orgasm over and over until I have a big one, and can't orgasm any more.    One of the easiest ways to orgasm is if you take the head off of your shower massage, so the thin jet of water is coming out, point it at your clitoris... Man does that feel good... You will orgasm in no time    If you do not have a shower massage, try laying down in the tub, and let the tap flow onto your clitoris... Just don't let the water flow with pressure into your vagina... That can be dangerous. That technique provides a powerful orgasm too|`|7ilEjRxeaa	Baha  I can get pretty awesome ones from the shower faucet.  Idk what else other than sex.

1KV5rfpIaa	Obesity isn't solely based on age and weight.  Height is a factor also! If you're 5'0" tall, then yes, you're overweight, if you're 6'0" tall, then no.  there are plenty of websites that you can go to to find your bmi.  Webmd.com is one of them.  As far as fruits that can cleanse your body, prunes are all that I know of.  Have fun with that! lol You definitely don't want to eat prunes all day at the age of 15, especially if you're active in sports like football! You'll be running off the field all day. Get my drift?  You can find all of that information at webmd.com.  goodluck!|`|M9X9usmzaa	it really depends on how tall you are and how much muscle you have?  age doesnt matter with weight.|`|CeqbfVscaa	Do the colon clense diet enter it into google|`|8kNLUDlPaa	Nobody can tell you if you're overweight unless you tell us how tall you are.

It is not a "constant" flow (except maybe on days 1 and 2 when the flow is heavier), but it's a just a drip or gush here and there.  Sometimes, when you go to the bathroom, the blood may come out just because you are flexing and relaxing those muscles, causing more blood to exit the uterus, other times it won't and you'll find that you are bleeding more into your pad than the toilet when you pee.

The weight lost due to all those "one week diets" only lose water weight, but once you begin eating normally again your weight will bounce back or even increase depending on how your metabolism works.   Also, you're only 13 years old, which means you are not done growing yet. According to your BMI you are at 20.7, which is a very healthy weight. If you really think you are overweight you might want to talk to your parents, or a trusted adult, because it could begin a problem later in life if you see yourself as overweight, when in reality you are quite healthy.|`|5BAwAqdhaa	Cardio|`|p5IR7ezTaa	Honestly there is not possible way to loose alot of weight in a week or so. trust me its going to take at least a month.

Chew on sugarfree gum if you feel like having a snack. It would be good if you exercised cause that would burn a lot of calories.

It will improve your emotions because of its cleansing effects. After 7 days you will begin to feel lighter because you will be lighter The effectiveness of this seven day plan is that the food eaten burns more calories than they give to the body in caloric value, but is completely nutritional and gives all vitamins, elements, etc. as required. This plan can be used as often as u like however it is suggested that you rest for a week between each repetition.    YOU MUST ABSTAIN FROM ALL ALCOHOL. YOU MUST DRINK 10 GLASSES OF WATER EACH DAY     DAY ONE - All fruits except bananas. Your first day will consist of all the fruits you want. It is strongly suggested that you consume lots of melons on the first day. Especially watermelon . If you limit your fruit consumption to melons, your chances of losing a lot of weight on the first day are very good.     DAY TWO - All vegetables. You are encouraged to eat until you are stuffed with all the raw or cooked vegetables of your choice. There is no limit on the amount or type. For your complex carbohydrate, you will start day two with a large boiled potato for breakfast. You may top the potato with one pat of butter.     DAY THREE - A mixture of fruits and vegetables of your choice. Any amount, any quantity. No bananas yet. No potatoes today.     DAY FOUR - Bananas and milk. Today you eat as many as eight bananas and drink three glasses of milk. This will be combined with the vegetable soup, which may be eaten in limited quantities.     DAY FIVE - Today is a feast day. You will eat sprouts and paneer and tomatoes. Eat 280 grams of sprouts and paneer. Combine this with six whole tomatoes. On day five you must increase your water intake by one quart. This is to cleanse your system of the uric acid you will be producing.     DAY SIX - Sprouts and paneer and vegetables. Today you may eat an unlimited amount of sprouts and paneer and vegetables. Eat to your hearts content.     DAY SEVEN - Today your food intake will consist of brown rice, fruit juices and all the vegetables you care to consume.  Vegetables can be taken in the form of salad if desired. No dressing except malt, white vinegar, squeezed lemon, garlic and herbs. No more than one teaspoon of oil. Do keep way from beans (Lima, Pinto, kidney.) because they tend to be high in calories even though they are very good for you.     BEVERAGES YOU MAY CONSUME WHILE ON THE PROGRAMME  Water flavored with lemon or lime if desired.     Plain soda     Black coffee, No cream or cream substitute, No sugar or sweeteners.     Black tea.     No fruit juices before Day 7.     HOW AND WHY IT WORKS  DAY ONE - You are preparing your system for the upcoming program. Your only source of nutrition is fresh fruits. Fruits are natures perfect food. They provide everything that you could possibly want to sustain life except total balance and variety.     DAY TWO - It starts with a fix of complex carbohydrates coupled with an oil does. This taken in the morning for energy and balance. The rest of Day 2 consists of vegetables, which are virtually calorie free and provide essential nutrients and fiber.     DAY THREE - Day 3 eliminates the potato because you are getting your calories from the fruits. Your system is now prepared to start burning the excess pounds. You will still get cravings, which will diminish by Day 4.     DAY FOUR - Bananas, milk and soup sound like the least desirable and strangest diet. You are in for a surprise. You will probably not eat all the bananas that you are allowed. But they are there for the potassium you will have lost and the Sodium that you may have missed during the last 3 days. You will notice a definite loss of desire for sweets. You will be surprised how easily this day will go.     DAY FIVE - Sprouts and tomatoes. The sprouts are for iron and protein. The tomatoes are for digestion and fiber. Lots and lots of water purity your system. You should notice colorless urine today. You must eat 6 tomatoes.     DAY SIX - Day 6 is similar to Day 5. Iron and proteins from sprouts, vitamins and fiber iron vegetables. By now your system is a total weight loss inclination. There should be a noticeable difference in the way you look from Day 1.     DAY SEVEN - Day 7 finishes of the program . Except it is much healthier. You have your system under control.
zMD0VeOmaa	I'm assuming that you are referring to a brain surgeon, which is professionally known as a neurosurgeon. Neuro is a prefix pertaining to the brain.    To learn about the brain you could look at an anatomy or physiology textbook.    Also, if you want to learn what a neurosurgeon does/knows you should try to job shadow one at a hospital. The average Joe on YA is not going to be an expert on neuroscience.    If you want to know about the human mind you could read Psychology Today. This is a pretty good magazine for the layperson.    If you are really ambitious you could review the scientific literature for psychology or neuroscience. Your local library may have access to professional journals on the subject.    I would suggest narrowing your focus. What about the brain or mind are you interested in? General knowledge on such things is good but if you were to talk to a psychologist or neuroscientist they would tell you that their research is focused in 1 area and is rather specialized.|`|nVkypeGBaa	I don't think you have much chance of learning anything if you can't even spell 'surgeon'.|`|fe16876db70eb19623aadb9b18c2358eaa	Fist, spelling counts if you want to get into medical school.

mqXyDTwwaa	A week before the event go on a carbo-depletion diet for three days, then a carbo-loading diet for three days. That should load your body up with a lot more carbs, which will delay the transition to fat burning.

omYoOmSlaa	Have you seen a dietitian to devise some healthy & high protein meals? If not, I'd put that on my list.    With acid-reflux, simply avoiding non-fattening foods won't help much. Also avoid greasy and spicy foods, onion, tomatoes, chocolate, peppers, and caffeine. Lie down at at 30 degree angle, no less than 2 hours after eating, in order to have enough time to digest foods & prevent reflux from occurring.    Aspiration and difficulty eating are a major challenge. Weight problems, lack of energy, and headaches could be related. As could the anxiety and panic attacks. You have been through A LOT! I don't know how long it's been since you beat cancer. It's possible that things will slowly become easier for you as you adjust (especially if it hasn't been very long). Recovery is never an easy road. I hope that you see an experienced counselor to work through the emotional issues: sadness, frustration, and anxiety.     I wish you the very best!|`|s5XNGbOMaa	Try an herbalist or homeopathic doctor... And make sure you tell them ALL of your symptoms and ALL of the medications you are taking to avoid interactions between treatments. Try low stress exercises that give you energy (yoga, for example) and helps you control panic attacks. Good luck, I hope you feel better. :)|`|AEAxZEveaa	Have they ever tested you for celiac disease? Most of these symptoms are consistant for a diagnosis of celiac. Fatigue, depression, anxiety, hypothyroidism, inability to gain weight, headaches, they're all consistant. You said you lost some taste buds, do a google search for geographic tongue and see if that's what it looks like. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that is a triggered when you ingest gluten (wheat, rye, barley, etc). I would tell your doctor to test you for it. If he balks, you can try a gluten free diet on your own and see if your symptoms improve. That's basically the cure for it, eating gluten free. Please take a look at these links:    Edit: I also found a study that links celiac disease to hearing loss : http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content...    And also one that links it to acid reflux: http://www.infantrefluxdisease.com/reflu...    I would be shocked if you didn't have it.

P90X is effing insane. I'm 19, and was doing it a little last year, but never really continued on it, you have to have the ambition to do it.

Remember to relax as well.|`|zU6Lf67Eaa	ur doing something wrong...does it have an applicator?? if so u probably didn't put it in far enough. if not...those kinds arent really good to use.  but dont worry(its supposed to hurt the first few times) once u get the hang of it it doesnt hurt anymore u wont even know its there..maybe if ur still having trouble.. use a mirror..idk|`|aeiP74PLaa	try dipping it in vasoline b4 u put it in so it slides in easier...if its like poking u then try using the wax u use on ur braces|`|e53739d33092d5f60935bcaf0602a760aa	the easiest way when you are first trying to use them is to lay on your bed, kind of on your side and slip it in, it should bother you less that way|`|GbfA7Rr8aa	try sitting down wit ur legs wide open and grab a mirror then stick it in and when its like 1/4 in angle it and slide it in until u only see the thinner plastic thing where u push it and let go... im sure this is the prob :)|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	I do it while sitting on the toilet with my legs apart .  Relax and put two fingers on the bottom of the 1st part where the 2 pieces of the tampon connect. RELAX it helps push the part you are holding until your fingers hit skin. Then push the 'plunger' part all the way. Be relaxed! at that part I feel some pressure but I keep pushing and when it hurts a little too much I stop and pull the 2 pieces out and then you don't feel it. . Make sure you push the tampon angles towards your back! good luck|`|YlzDl7NRaa	hmmm thats wierd. maybe ur doing it wrong. idk, but if it's that bad, you should go to a doctor.|`|Oh2wVMkyaa	go to a doctor and switch to pads|`|TOa38qzEaa	no they dont! i been using them since i was 11!!!! they r my miracle in a box!!! haha juss read the instructions!!!!!!!!! good luck!!!! one love!!!!!!!|`|SvQ5ZhjJaa	you might not be putting it in the right way.  you have to put it up at a 45 degree angle.   not straight back or straight up.   right between.  it could also might not be all the way in. make sure its pushed up all the way.  while you are putting it in make sure your fingers touch skin. then you know its in all the way!  and remember to RELAX! it will go in a lot easier!    hope this helps! :D|`|DgAOboZNaa	r u putting them in the right hole?  also its okay just switch to pads|`|422d6140bb3d0712c59171dec1efdc97aa	Hun use the smallest size possible like the pink tampax ones, haha I know by color not by name. Anyway I remember when I first tried them I got like x-large by mistake and oh gosh that hurt so bad and it was because I was trying to put in there some huge thing. Anyway get the tampons that have the nice round plastic aplicators like tampax pearl and stuff, then like wet the plastic a tiny bit before putting it in [for lubrication] and like go on a squatted position, put the tampon in and push the bottom. That should do, it will be uncomfy a tiny bit at first but give it a day and you'll get used to it. Also make sure you kinda push it in and doesn't stay like  a bit hanging out of your vagaygay cuz that will make it very uncomfortable! good luck|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	are you insirting them correctly??  this might not be your brand you are using(tampax pearl)  try calling this number it has a automated computer to explain step by step how to insert one correctly.and the also have people you can talk to if you have more questions.also make sure you insirt them fully check to make sure it iz not hanging out any.this brand also may not be for you so if you can switch to a different brand.you can talk to your mom and explain you do not like pads and that they are uncomfortable,and hurt.hopei helped!!!|`|HDUq1ls7aa	Yeah you're doing something wrong.     Not asking your mother for advice, because why...    It takes practice and you have none, and thats one reason why it hurts like hell. The other is it's dry.

But beware of SUGARS, which often cause crashes and depression.  Also people often have adverse reactions to artificial colors and preservatives.    Get as much natural light as possible.

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	It is fairly common to have pain after fusion surgery...yet it's also common to have pain after having a baby.  Pain may or may not be associated with scoliosis.      In either case, you've got a history that is suggestive of back problems.      Physical therpay is definetely a good option for now.|`|c68nVKIYaa	A friend of mine, now retired, had surgery for scoliosis decades ago. She tells me she enjoyed her pregnancies but that pain problems developed later, especially around menopause. Apparently the abnormal scoliosis posture is partly corrected while carrying the baby inside. But after birth, when you carry the child outside (on the hip, for instance), you are likely to adopt postures that really strain your already out-of-alignment back. You should never shift your pelvis to one side, for instance, it needs to be centered.     My friend eventually got treated with the Schroth method (specialized physiotherapy) and now has no pain that she can't readily fix. It is effective whether you've had fusion surgery or not.     See the standard textbook on the method below, and the personal website of its author, who treated scoliosis patients for 50 years. The latter has an article on exercises for post-operative patients. On the left margin of the German site, click on the link "What can patients do following surgery for spinal fusion"|`|QGlJlIyAaa	(I had to learn to pack EXTEREMLY light, I have a terrible knee, my doctor did not want me carrying my kids and all their stuff soo...

3c57UA3Yaa	You know, could it be that you are taking your blood pressure wrong?     * Is your arm on a flat surface(table) at level with your heart ?   * If your arm is lower than then your heart = falsely high readings   * Arm higher than your heart = falsely low readings    NL= around 120/80  systolic/diastolic  Hypertension = High blood pressure    From Wikipedia-    Prehypertension 120  139 systolic or 80  89 diastolic  Stage 1 Hypertension 140  159 systolic or 90  99 diastolic  Stage 2 Hypertension  160systolic  or  100 diastolic    According to this you have stage one hypertension.     I would really suggest that you see a doctor for a check up and get your pressure taken by a professional.     When's the last time you went?   Also, I would think this would show in your medical history.  I'd advise you to go talk to your mom about scheduling a check up.    P.S. I'm glad you asked about this.  Thank you for not ignoring it.     Best of luck,  Andriana|`|Q6jOWIN2aa	YES! normal is 120/80 , sometimes less.  Make sure you have been sitting for 5 minutes or longer before taking it, that includes no talking...|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	That's high. Your top number should be around 120 and your bottom number around 80.|`|G0zmqaN4aa	Wow perfect blood pressure.|`|AA10313901	NO    Your blood pressure is far too high, especially for someone of your age.     Go to an urgent care facility or something now.|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	No, that is too high.      Normal blood pressure is 120/80.  If your at-rest pressure is that high, likely, you would go over 200 easily.    How much salt do you eat??  Do you eat fast food a lot?  Do you drink Coke or Pepsi?  (caffeine)   Salt intake makes HUGE difference.  You'd be amazed how much salt you are eating...!    It is not so high that you need to be hospitalized, but it is too high that you need to watch what you eat, and if it does not come down, may need medication.  You might want to ask your parents for a doctor's visit soon.    By the way, you didn't measure your blood pressure on the same arm more than once did you?  If you measure your pressure on the same arm every 5 minutes, it will keep going higher.  Also, home blood pressure meters aren't calibrated.  Your reading may not be accurate.|`|8c588f73595e6a75b68bbeae9011c8d1aa	GO TO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY!  That's a wayy to high  you should seriously see a doctor or have the equipemnt fixed  it should be 120 on top 80 on bottom    Add your numbers 160+100=260   divide by 2   which is 130  the closer your number to 100 the better yours is really off|`|yatZTVHmaa	your legally dead|`|0Hcqekl8aa	It's high for your age.

ITS TOO HIGH. you must go to the doctor, the normal blood pressure is  near 120 / 80. it is dangerous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|N8VS0Ofxaa	a normal blood pressure is around 120/70 give or take a little .The way to correctly check your blood pressure and determine if its consistently high is to check it every day  twice a day for one week.Another Factor in high blood pressure is a family history of hypertension. weight  plays a part in high blood pressure but you can be thin and still have high blood pressure.remember diet and exercise also affects a persons blood pressure cut back on salt and start eating garlic! high blood pressure in such a young person could be caused by a very serious health problem or a virus i would suggest if it stays high to see a Doctor like i said check it for a few days and see if it stays high,good luck

Also, acupuncture could help it has helped my couisin who suffered from this type of pain and migraines.  There's something called ice pick pain that about 40% of migraine patients have. To my cousin, it feels exactly like what you would imagine having an ice pick slammed into your head would feel like.

AA11432707	By definition, no.  Anesthesia means "without feeling" :)    If you are having local anesthesia only, it hurts when that is injected.  The medication burns a lot, but only for a few seconds.  If it's inside the nose, that area can be anesthetized by sticking cotton soaked in anesthetic up your nose.  Uncomfortable for a few minutes, but not painful.    If you have sedation or general anesthesia, there is no pain or discomfort involved, apart from the initial IV stick.    Different types of anesthesia are appropriate for different nose surgeries.|`|RvSHQtrXaa	No.|`|sdFoawrIaa	depends on what type you are given, if it is a local, then you will feel a slight pinch because they are injecting the medication directly to the area, but if it is a full sedation, then now you won't feel anything.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	They will probably put a mask over your face and tell you to count.

54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	It is possible, but not usual, to get a cold while on antibiotics.  See, a virus likes to attack a healthy person, because the virus is dependent on your cells and DNA to reproduce.  A weakened host is less beneficial to a virus.  On the other hand, a bacterium prefers a host that is already weakened by virus infection, since the bacteria feed off the body rather than using its DNA as a factory.    So, I don't know; it sounds like you have been having multiple infections in the recent past, since you say you (or rather your bacteria) are resistant to some antibiotics.  You ought to do something to build up your immune system, not just kill off germs.  It probably is a good idea to consult your doctor about this odd change of symptoms.  If it's a virus, of course, you will just have to let it run its course.  But if, as I suspect, it's another bacterial infection, you will probably need another antibiotic; if so, be sure to get one that your bugs aren't resistant to.|`|o3OU7wSKaa	Sounds to me like allergies.

de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	Well I don't suggest girls taking diet pills because on one hand, it is expensive; on the other hand, it doesn't seem that effective comparing to having regular exercises and restricted diet.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.

Tu9S1WaNaa	NO, don't use the treadmill.  You should not do anything that has you putting weight on your hip.  See if you can borrow a exercise bike off of somebody and try that.  A recumbant bike is best.  Try a bike for a week or 2, if you can.

If you feel pain while walking on it, stop.<br>  <br>  If exercise cases pain, it defeats the whole purpose.<br>  <br>  Ask your Doctor to be sure:)
5R9d1U2Iaa	i lost 12 pounds in about 2 weeks by eating a grapefruit for breakfast and lots of lunch meat, veggies (raw and cooked) and fruit and water|`|XGgJR8TVaa	Look at my question then leave a comment if you wana no how i did it in six days :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226084130AASgAqY&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|guGUoQKEaa	Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>  <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>  <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>
eQCsKq4jaa	Sorry for your troubles.<br>  <br>  Zoloft can cause depression. It depends on her age but there is a an FDA Black Box warring on all antidepressants for an increase in depression and suicide. But this is very rare and only for people 25 and younger. And often it will make the depression worse before it gets better. <br>  <br>  Changing meds can often be very difficult for people- Even if it ends up working well. <br>  <br>  And just so you know Zoloft is not really for Bipolar (not on its own). Normally mood stabilizers are given (Depakote, Tegretol, Lithium, risperidone).<br>  <br>  Having said the medical stuff- if she is important to you (and it Sounds like she is) then wait it out. Zoloft can take 6 weeks to work. Keep trying. Be there when she needs you. And right now perhaps she does need some space, probably not from you so much but so she can get better.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Go to the library - there are books on bipolar. They usually have a chapter for the friends/relatives. There is also at least one book that is specifically written for the loved ones.<br>  <br>  When you have bipolar depression/mixed moods, you may be spending all day in bed, or you just don't want to go out, or see anyone. You want to be alone all the time. It isn't very good for the bipolar person, either, to be alone so much.  zoloft causes severe sexual side effects too, as a warning, if you two are sexually involved. Most people cannot orgasm on zoloft, and may have less libido, too. She should not be on zoloft alone if she has bipolar - she should also be on a mood stabilizer such as lithium or depakote or lamictal - if not, that doctor is almost commiting malpractice, unless all those other approaches have failed-there are some special cases, but not  many.  zoloft can cause severe mania in folks with bipolar.|`|TdqeC0vmaa	a little bit of what everyone said. <br>  <br>  Make sure to contact her regularly. At least once a day. But do not make it seem like you are "babysitting" her mental health. Just talk to her like you normally would. <br>  Make sure not to contact her repeatedly and since she is withdrawn right now do not try to drag her out of the house to go out or insist on coming over if she doesn't seem interested leave it at that and dont take personal offense to it. <br>  <br>  Let her know one consise time that <br>  she means the world to you and that your there and want to help her and make it easier on her in anyway you can. That you'll be there and available when she needs you to be she just has to let you know what she needs from you when she does and you'll do your best to provide it. <br>  <br>  As far as the bpd, its important to tack on that "she needs to let you know when she is need of you" because people with bpd tend to be hyper vigilant if someone close to them loves them or not. If she is in need of you or something from you she may expect you to be a mind reader and know what it is and if you aren't there to provide it because she didnt let you know she may be extremely hurt.  So that extra bit assures her in advance that you will be there - but she HAS to tell you what she needs when she needs it - and you wont fail her if she does.<br>  <br>  So regular but not excessive contact. Not always about "are you ok"<br>  Do not force her to go out or visit if she doesn't want to and dont take it personally. When her mood and her meds get straight she'll be ready to go again. <br>  make yourself available when she does say she needs you but in the politest way possible in advance make sure she knows that she needs to tell you when she needs you. <br>  Be patient and tolerant. Accepting that this has to do with her mental state and her medications rather than the type of person she is and that it will pass. Times like these are a part of what we take on when we are in relationships with people with mental health issues.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Every time someone with a mental disorder has their meds changed it takes four to six weeks to work if they even work.  If they are not working, the meds will be changed again and it will be another 4 to 6 weeks.  Right now she is not herself but give her space and time and she will be.  Just tell her she means the world to you and you will give her the space to start feeling better.|`|h7uxxiZZaa	Stay with her. ask her what she wants of you(like what to do and space) dont leave her like my ex did. I tried to kill myself because i was A total loser as he put it. dont hurt her.|`|vVh7ex7daa	Having a mental illness can often make a person act in ways they wouldnt ordinarily act. It is good that she has your support and the best thing for you to remember is that she isnt herself right now. Her meds will be affecting her behaviour and she will need a few weeks to become stable. Tell her you are there when she needs you and just try to act as normal as possible around her to give her some feeling of security. Dont wrap her in cotton wool and just let hr get on with her life on her own because if you try and protect her from things etc she may feel smothered or like you dont think she can manage things alone. Give her a shoulder to lean on but also give her independance. Her behvaiour is likely to alter many times over hel lifetime as this is someting she will have to deal with for life. If you feel like you can handle that then thats great for you both but eventually if her behaviour becomes erratic then you may need to seek help also. I have worked as mental health nurse and we offered respite to many relatives of people with mental illness because taking care of someone can be exhausting.|`|xnZi0i8saa	What I need when my meds aren't working is for my partner to be there but not smothering, just like you say. I suggest staying in the background but there and available. Don't baby her or treat her like an invalid. If she is at home maybe call and leave a message once a day but not 12 times a day. Don't ask if she is OK, we hate that, just tell her you love her. Everyone is a little different..... maybe best to ask her what you can do and what she would like from you. Kudos to you for supporting her. given time you will both learn how to dance the dance. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  You should make sure you have the phone numbers of her Pdoc and her therapist in case, and if you suspect that she is suicidal you should get her to an emergency room immediately. <br>  <br>  People say that loving someone with bipolar is a wild ride. It is. But it all depends on how you look at it and how you feel about her whether it's a ride through hell or the most awesome roller coaster you've ever been on. It can be difficult but it will also give you days that you never imagined could be as wonderful!|`|AA11146632	People with Bi polar can have quite severe mood swings, and it is difficult to know sometimes where you stand.  She may say one thing one minute, then another the next.  If she is only taking Zoloft, then that suggests the condition is not that bad, but that she just has depression - at the moment. If she has true Bi-polar, be ready for a rough ride, but try to stick by her as she will need your support.  She may respond to psychotherapy, but again not necessarily, as it is chemical imbalance in the brain.|`|VK4hUu23aa	well first of all zoloft isnt a good drug for her to be on with bp1. zoloft is more of an anti depressant. <br>  Be sensitive to her needs. But don't treat her like shes some scary crazy lady. All you can really do is love her and let her know shes loved daily. Sometimes thats all you need to feel better.|`|Q9nFkWpzaa	you should support her ask her how she is feeling ask her if there is anything you can do to help ask if you can go with her to one of her appointment your input on how she is doing and her moods will help the doctor to help her better they way we see ourselves is totally differant than how other people see us her behavior and moods have an impact on everyone around her she my be acting or behaving in ways she dosent see gine her a liltle space keep an eye on her if she is becoming withdrawn thats a sign of depression watch how fast she bounces in between moods and try to read some books on bipolar disorder and find a support group it will help you greatly to understand her but watever you do dont give up on her it sounds like you really care about her keep supporting her thats real inpotant

I would guess that maybe you are not drinking enough water. It sounds silly, but dehydration can make you very dizzy and cause all kinds of problems. I NEVER drink water, and get all my water from soda and juice. but I've been trying lately because I know it can cause problems. People are supposed to drink 8 large glasses of water a day, if you're in a warmer, or dryer area, that is supposed to double to 16!!! We both should get on it, lol.|`|kmOGe7KOaa	hyertension or tachycardia sounds like a good possibilty  if ur heart races than yes if not than u may have a prob with ur thyroid  being hypo  im a nurse  so i see this stuff all the time  but good luck at the doc
IKakoOfyaa	It depends on your age and whether or not you have the actual BCG vaccine or a PPD test (two different things).  If you did get the BCG, immunity tends to diminish over time and becomes virtually ineffective in adulthood.  In most countries, the vaccine is administered only once.|`|XkWd08Uvaa	not necessary --only once in life
WOHc22Xiaa	When you get a cavity they drill it and fill it with either resin or amalgam. I work in a dentist office and i've never heard of that.|`|AA10873763	I've never heard of such a thing.  It makes more sense to be particularly careful about brushing those teeth and watch for signs of decay.  A sealent can also be applied.<br>  I'd seek a second opinion, at least.  It sounds fishy to me.|`|NmqMKHvWaa	No, it's NOT common to place a restoration as a preventive measure.  What is common though, is to place a sealant in those grooves, which is what you should have there to prevent future caries.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Well, there's another thing called 'sealant' that could be put on the teeth to protect them.  A dentist might do this even if the enamel still looked okay.  I had sealant put on when I was 12, it's still intact, and I never got cavities on those teeth.<br>  <br>  Your teeth may be healthy now, but remember she can see them better than you can and she's probably looked in hundreds of mouths.|`|DUwJVUxQaa	It sounds like you are talking about fissure sealants. These are thin 'fillings' that are put on the biting surface of your molars/premolars to reduce the likelihood of decay in the grooves. <br>  <br>  They're a good idea and decrease the chance of decay in those fissures by a fair bit (I can't remember the percentage) and don't require drilling of the tooth they're placed on.<br>  <br>  I've had my 4 to 7s sealed in all four quadrants of the mouth. If you can afford it I would get them done. It can save money in the long run.|`|XOIX0Wg1aa	I've had it done before. It will probably save you time and money in the long run. But then again, there's always the chance that you don't get the fillings and your teeth never develop cavities. It's really your decision.
efmaKbfxaa	I dont know about all such things.But walking,running,cycling r the best exercises.Dont try to go for  VLCC and all such things.The above exercises in fresh air is good for health.|`|X9QOHRLFaa	VLCC is a big scam company i am talking with personal , i waster above  Rs 12,000. before you join in their program they act as if they are your new best friends. They are gonna promise you the world , but as soon as you pay up the attitude totally changes, they give you a stupid massage with this cream which suppose to melt the fat of your body. After 2 months and 12,000 rupees i just lost 3 kgs and as soon as i left their program i again 5 back. In my suggestion  dont waste any time or money with this company. well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in|`|y7bISY8saa	i dont think so a number of those i know who have tried these pacakges gained back all the weight they may have lost|`|Bbfaqawbaa	VLCC OR OTHE RCOMPANY'S ARE NOT WORTHABLE AND IT WILL EFFECT HEALTH<br>  <br>  ITS MY OPINION ONLY<br>  <br>  THE MAIN THING TO LOSS THE WAIGHT IS WALKING DAILY 2 HOURS MORNING & EVENING<br>  SKIPPING<br>  RUNNING<br>  <br>  PROPPER DIET
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Any size added to your weight will do the opposite of what you want.  If you want to look a bit thicker, do push ups.  Every day before you shower, do 3 sets of as many push ups as you can, with a 2 minute rest in between sets.|`|XnIdLz9xaa	stop doing cardio, that will make you lose weight rather than bulk up. do strength training like weightlifting, push ups, and chin ups if you have a chin up bar, they're probably the best.
IKakoOfyaa	Sounds like the flu to me.  If it has been less than 48 hours since your symptoms started, call your doctor.  There are medications you can take that will greatly reduce the time you are ill and the severity of the symptoms.  You really should be seen anyway to rule out strep, pneumonia or other conditions.|`|6jJ01uNjaa	Go to the doctor, sounds like tonsillitis
IKakoOfyaa	Yes, you should be watching for symptoms.  Mono is spread via direct contact with saliva.  If you shared straws or eating utensils, there is a higher chance you are going to come down with it, although nothing is ever 100 percent.  It can take anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks to start exhibiting symptoms of mono after a person becomes infected with it.|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	yes. you can get it especially if ur immune system is weak. Yes definaltey
MLpfzoexaa	I wish I could help you more, but you and I are kind of in the same boat. I'm a 16 year old male, and I have been dealing with bullying and emotional abuse for as long as I can remember. I've pretty much stopped going to school, and now I just stay home and hide out in my room all the time. Like you, I always feel left out and ugly. I have horrible body image, but I'm trying so hard to get over that.    Up until recently, I'd never had any friends, or been close to anyone, but not long ago, I very unexpectedly made one great friend. She is accepting of all my quirks and flaws, and she makes me feel like maybe life is worth something after all.    Before I met her, I had pretty much abandoned all hope for my future or ever having anyone worth caring about who cared for me as well.  My life is far from perfect, or anything even near that, but now at least I've got hope.    So, the best advice I have for you is to just hang in there. Take things one day at a time.  The best friends you can ever have are usually the ones who come along when you least expect it, and one good friend is really all it takes to make everything seem worthwhile again.      If you'd like to talk, my email is,  naked_trees@yahoo.com    :]|`|J4BxsLSXaa	As I got ur question u have Ageorphobia, are u sure that it is PHOBIA?

I feel as what you've described as "the odd one out in any crowd or the ugliest person alive". and I'm male,20 and lonely as well.      You have to work on the way you see yourself(your self-esteem) as it not only affects you on the personal level(behavior, thinking, attitude) but also on the interpersonal level(how you perceive and deal with others) thus your productivity as an individual which will in turn create feelings of hopelessness and inferiority.      I'd suggest you to read the following books:  1- 7 Habits of highly effective people  2- "the six pillars of self-esteem" or "the power of self-esteem"  If you had any trouble finding these books I can e-mail them to you    Good luck man|`|hEH9pWABaa	Nothing we can tell you will change your mind, John!  You know, I'm a 19 year old guy as well, So i know what's going on in your mind.    You stay at home because you have little experience in the outside world and don't know "How to act"  But staying at home makes you miss out on further experience. It's kind of like a loop!   :/    But you know, there are many people who can help.  The guy who's helping me out right now (Not directly, ofcorce) is David Deangelo. (He's a dating Guru)    What I'm trying to say is, being in a relationship with a beautiful & intelligent girl WILL boost our self-esteem up to its pinnacle and allow us to live a better life.   David teaches us HOW to get that girl....  Look him up on the net and read his material.  :)    Tc

ucVgUcDvaa	I work in a dental office, I am a RDA. Dentist's like the you to use the soft toothbrushes because they will not cause damage to your gums. Most people scrub at there teeth really hard and do not realize it. So soft would be best. Erosion of the gums can cause many problems. Your gums will shrink up and expose roots and that will cause allot of discomfort and pain.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	You should use soft toothbrushes, they are less harsh on the enamel and gums.  Also you should use a toothbrush with a compact head, this makes it easier to clean the back molars.<br>  But electric toothbrushes are really the best.|`|NLAek2bJaa	The softer the better. Hard bristle toothbrushes over time from brushing are really hard on your teeth. Especially when you use toothpaste. Toothpaste is abrasive and can cut down on your enamel. Soft bristle toothbrushes are just better of your enamel and still do the job and clean them.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	I guess it depends on you. I work in a dental office and when the pt's leave we usually give them soft toothbrushes. I guess some ppl need soft cause their sensitive. Just don't go crazy and scrub your teeth really hard and make your gums bleed because that's not good you can clean your teeth without doing that.|`|XNc5moJEaa	The softer the better for sure! They even sell extra soft which I highly recommend.  The common misconception is that they don't clean your teeth as well. WRONG! The bristles just wear faster, so you need to replace the toothbrush more frequently.-  Those answers above are all really good, I just wanted to add my two cents!|`|IKakoOfyaa	A soft toothbrush is better as long as you brush adequately and floss as well.  It's easy to damage your gums with toothbrush bristles that are too stiff.|`|PjyP8yEiaa	soft is better! As long as you brush 2 minutes and floss daily you are ok.|`|B6eh96dCaa	its best if you use soft because hard is not doing anything

Remember she would have been taught that menstruation is something not to be talked about, that the vagina is a dirty place that shouldnt be touched, so tampons and cups arent very ladylike. You also have the old idea that breaking your hymen was a sign you were no longer a virgin, so tampons and cups could be seen as even more unbecoming. Look around places like the Museum of Menstruation http://www.mum.org they probably have all sorts of adverts from when she was a young woman that will show just how disgusting they thought menstruation and female genitals were. Oh and she probably wore cloth pads which are a whole hell of a lot less gross and uncomfortable than commercial pads most women wear today, she wont know the evils of using Always pads as she may have worn more comfortable cloth pads, but hell that doesnt matter as she has no control over what you use anyway.    She may also remember the scandals relating to tampons, in the 1980s there was the toxic shock syndrome scandal where over 62 million women were given dangerous tampons despite manufacturers knowing they were killing people. In the 1990s we found out tampons contained dioxin which causes cancer and any number of other health problems, plus general health problems tampons cause to begin with. I know a lot of women who will not allow their daughters or granddaughters to use tampons for this reason, older women may not fully understand menstrual cups so may consider them just as dangerous and unhygienic as tampons.     It could just be that it is not ladylike and because of taboos she has been raised with she felt uncomfortable and upset about this so dealt with it by being angry and not explaining herself  trust me as someone who works dealing with menstrual health a lot of women are not just shy about the subject but can be very defensive about talking about menstruation, even to the point of being abusive. I wouldnt try quizzing her about this because she may not be comfortable talking about it so it would just cause problems, just carry on using your cup, its up to you what you use and no business of hers.|`|MwRVtPAgaa	IT IS NOT A BIG  DEALIO TAMPONS ARE SO MUCH BETTER JUST DONT TELL HER OR ASK HER WH YSHE IS SO AGINST THEM IM SURE SHE USED EM TOO|`|4zoN1U3Waa	gramms will always be gramms.use what you feel most comfortable wearing.|`|9HaNKSRHaa	well....maybe shes on crack!!!!oh no!!!!!!! jk|`|JSD0RYhzaa	i think that her mother or guardian always told her to use pads so she is against tampons.    she might be so against tampons beacuse of the TSS risk    divacups are totally safe, maybe she doesnt think theyre hygenic?    try talking to her about how you feel about pads; i know what you mean becuase i hate pads theyre really gross.|`|isxDvwlraa	whats a diva cup?

The fact that your stool is bright red means that you'd bleeding in a lower area of your GI tracts.<br>  <br>   Now, this can be a number of things, be seeing you have IBS means that we can take out Tumors. Now, you probably just have hemorrhoids. THAT or you have a anal fissure, which you should go to the doctor for. An Anal fissure is a tear in the the anal canal, so go to the doctor as soon as possible.|`|Kkd1Uxn9aa	With the increase in BM it may also be hemorrhoids.  They usually say if the blood is bright red it more than likely is coming from closer to the anal area....when it is black or darker blood it is more internal.

Is this a matter of loosing a lot of weight or just dropping a few pounds?  <br>  <br>  Can your goals be achieved through smarter eating habits like avoiding junk food, sodas, etc., portion control and regular exercise?  And have you discussed this with your parents or doctor?  <br>  <br>  I knew a gal that used Slimfast while we were in college.  The bad thing about it is it will make you need to go....poop...and it can be a really urgent need.  I remember sitting in final exams with her, hearing her stomach gurgling and seeing her in a lot of discomfort because had she left the room to go - she would not have been allowed back in & would've failed that final.<br>  <br>  Consider tweaking your lifestyle before resorting to things like Slimfast - I've read & answered a few of your questions & know you're kind of young.  Please don't harm your body in your desire to drop some weight - be smart about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	It's what I would call an "empty fix". You will lose weight if you follow all the instructions, but you will probably put it back on when you go back to your normal eating habits. The best way to loose weight is to adjust your eating habits, gradually, make sure you excercise more than you normally do and continue to do both, once you are happy with your new weight. Honestly, there is no real magical formula that will make you thin. You need determination and effort.|`|38c506872bfde6a2b06cd75e74dfc215aa	yes they do and no they don't. while i was using slim fast the hunger got so bad i nearly past out everyday so if you fairly energetic don't use it.. i lost on average 2-3pound a week and altogether about a stone and half, the bad news is that 3 weeks after stopping it i gained all the weight plus back, and it wasn't due to over eating..i think the lack of food puts your body into starvation mode..weight watchers is better and proberly cheaper in the long run coz slim fast products are so expensive|`|AA11476749	Liquid diets may work in the short term, but rarely have lasting effects.  If you really want to lose weight, you need to eat better (smaller portions, more often, and no junk) and exercise.<br>  <br>  The key is to burn more calories than you take in.  Although the idea is relatively simple, in practice, it takes determination.|`|vlCWp7sSaa	Well I tried it twice now.

Good luck!<br>  Addy|`|guGUoQKEaa	Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>  <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>  <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>|`|YhiKxrhfaa	Ive never tried it but i always got told that it just processed stuff with no sought of goodness , so it cant count as a decent meal|`|G1OSlub8aa	Its pretty much sugar water, not very healthy nor is it an effective way to lose weight.|`|eHUXcYZhaa	Yeah it is really good.

qL3dGTXDaa	They are concerned you don't take things at face value. What the therapist is concerned with is the story you make up about what you experience. Instead of stating "I am human and have flaws", you have a story that there is something wrong with you, "I am screwed up and so is society".   Society is what Society is. You like to put a spin (story) on Society. It is kinda like you against the world instead of you being with the world as we know it.|`|ttL8zjuZaa	http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=864 mo...|`|WXExyAlWaa	It would probably depend on the context and how you say it. If you seem to be in a low mood and are talking a lot about bad things or seeming to exaggerate ("everything I do is wrong", "I can't ever do ____") then they will probably assume it's not quite true. However if you seem in a stable frame of mind and it's a reasonable statement ("sometimes I have trouble explaining myself and it leads to a lot of conflict") they will take it as self-awareness.|`|3pfhWdRKaa	It is normal to see your own flaws and to see the flaws of society. This is a sign of an intellectual person who is self-aware. It is different if the only thing you see is flaws, but otherwise, seeing the bad is just as important as seeing the good. Tell your therapist how you feel, you might be surprised by the response you get.

That must be taking you maybe 9 minutes?    Don't think so much in terms of distance, but in terms of time.

pSaUlVa5aa	Perhaps he realized that you were getting a little too close and that can bring ethical issues.  You were feeling comfortable with him being that close, but he has an ethical responsibility to maintain the relationship purely professional.  It is very common for clients to get or feel attached to their therapists, it's called transference.  I am not saying that you are falling for him or him for you, but being with someone for so long can begin to seem as a relationship other than professional.<br>  Perhaps you can bring it up in a session and he may be able to tell you why.  You already have developed a rapport with him and he's a professional, I think he'd welcome your input on the behaviour that you have observed.<br>  I think that it may have to do more with you than with him.  Perhaps you felt that you were closer than you thought and he never actually saw it that way.|`|6nDqvtwbaa	It's very unprofessional to develop a relationship with a client.  It can happen easily, but it's frowned upon and he probably recognized that.<br>  <br>  He's telling you there are boundaries here basically.|`|AA11146632	Counsellors and therapist have a strict rule not to get too close to their clients.  He may have suddenly realised that you liked what he did naturally, so has pulled back from you for your sake and his.  He could lose his licence to practice if you form any kind of relationship with him.  You must just treat him as your counsellor and no more.<br>  I made that mistake with a therapist, and it was extremely painful as it was completely unrequited.  Don't fall into that trap.  If you feel you can't cope with this feeling, change counsellors.|`|bce7c7c86797ed7f455b74b4180876ddaa	Maybe there is something going on in his life that is bothering him. Counselors have bad days too, it probably isn't you.|`|h7uxxiZZaa	it shouldnt be that way. you should never be that close to him.|`|vVh7ex7daa	That kind of closeness doesnt sound right to me. I have visited a counsellor and he was amzing but the closest we got was to shake hands. Maybe you should tell him how you feel. If he is a porffesional he should take it well and understand and maybe shed some light on the whole thing. Maybe he didnt mean to be close to you and is feeling a little worried that you took it the wrong way and is trying to maintain a professional relationship. It is easy to feel close to someone with such high status, a person who is very good at his job and makes you feel better. You should never misinterpret this for anything other than a patient-counsellor relationship though.
RLoilwCNaa	Stick with the one smoke a day for a while so that you get adjusted. Then try quitting that. Give it a month or so though. 2 packs to 1 smoke a day? Dude, you've got will power others dream of having. You the man!|`|nWyvrEX6aa	Not joking, but at the times when you go for that cigarette, try putting something else in your mouth that you can hold. Lollipop, something with a straw in it, toothpick. Cigarettes are a stimulant and not "calming" as people say. The "calming" sensation is not from the cigarette itself, but from the act of putting something to your mouth and hanging out for a few minutes while you smoke it.|`|bzfv8aT9aa	You really need to stop.

f966794dd5f5624dccef6e082cb91dc2aa	You may have a strain or tear on the meniscus, comes with sports that have a high degree of impact on the legs, may have to adopt sports with less running and jumping for your workout, I speak from personal experience, I liked playing basketball and tennis, but check with your doctor first.|`|mY19PPlIaa	Whenever you get any type of knee surgery done you will more then likely develop arthritis.  I got knee surgery done for a torn meniscus and everytime I go for long walks or jogs ya my knee is killing me for the next weeks. Its really easy to develop arthritis which sounds what you might be having. Or it could be that 30 mintues was too much fore you. I would try to lose weight with diet only and once you have lost a good amount of weight and are lighter there should be less impact on your bad knee. But listen to what your body tells you and if it hurts dont do it. So put off going up stairs or doing anything hard on your knees. You should also take up physical therapy this helps alot.|`|juU6nJqUaa	With your history it sounds like you should check with the joint doctor, just to make sure nothing is really wrong.  <br>  <br>  But then again, it may just be that you strained it working out.  If the joint doctor gives you the go ahead, keep walking!  It is the best thing you can do for your whole body.  I used to have pain in just one knee, but after I started hiking with my husband the pain became less over time.  Sometimes strengthening the muscles in your legs, takes alot of the stress off the joint.

I wish you luck.|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	Depends do you feel better than others for no reason. Or is it that you feel only you can do things "right". And others are not capable of doing things "right" so you have to do them all to get them done well? I think being bipolar will make little feelings more exaggerated and when someone appears to not be doing things or saying things in ways you feel they should be done it gets magnified because of your problem and you constantly feel like you can do everything better. I get this and its hard and sometimes mean things slip out but most of the time I acknowledge that everyone does things their own way and I need to allow it to stay sane and not feel like I have to do everything for everyone.|`|Q9nFkWpzaa	yes i 2 am bipolar  it feels like ur so full of life like ur on cloud 9 and cant sit still like you can do anything and i to get irratated really quick something simple as someone clapping can make me want to knock the crap out of them make you feel like you just have to hit something or tear something apart consouling dont help i think its cause they havent actually gone trough this they dont feel this way and unless u urself go through this you can have any clue to how it feels or wat to do they can tell us what to but they dont no thats why thier therapy dont frakin work get a therapist thats gone through it and ya might get some help but its very unlikely ull find a doc  thats just as screwed up as we are keep ur head up your not the only one who has this problem :)|`|rdKuvxYJaa	Yes.

When I was younger, I used to literally think I was the antichrist, though. A psychiatrist said that is probably because I was severely sexually abused for many years as a girl, and I got counseling for it while I took navane (an antipsychotic) and that's why it got better - the navane helped enough that I could go thru the counseling.<br>  <br>  I have not been able to find meds to help me, and I have severe symptoms of mixed moods all the time. I am intensely suicidal over half the time.  I even tried ECT this past summer, and it totally failed.  My psychiatrist swears up and down this is rare though, that all her other bipolar patients thru the years do improve on meds, except me and one other woman (and my brother, who of course, has similar genetics).<br>  <br>  Ask your psychiatrist who she thinks is a good therapist. Or ask around at bipolar support groups.  I hope you are taking meds - you have to keep trying them, or you will be hopelessly ruined like I am and end up in the hospital every few months, like I do.  Bipolar is rotten. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are manic, you may think that everyone else is incompetent or lazy, and that is the bipolar controlling your thinking - and you have to watch for that. Ditto for when you think everyone hates you or doesn't care - that is the depression or mixed moods talking.

G6TelRBPaa	It's not sold in stores because it doesn't work.  The reason it is selling so well online is because all the people who have ordered it and have complaints about it can't take their complaints to a real person.  If there was any store selling the acai berry pills that they offer online, with the same business tactics of getting people to sign up for recurring billing by offering them a free trial, they wouldn't last long at all.    Don't listen to what most people on the internet have to say about the Acai Berry pills. Anyone that gives you a link to an acai berry website is making a commission when you order through that link. They don't care if the diet pill really works or not, they just want to make their commission.    The acai berry is so popular these days because when you sign up for a free trial and pay the $5 in shipping, the person that got you to click the link gets $30 commission. That's because you when you agree to the fine print when ordering your free trial, you are agreeing to have them automatically charge your credit card each month for more of the acai product.

But you can and should get fiber from fruits and vegetables.  Its not so much the food that does it but the fiber in it.   <br>  <br>  If you haven't changed your diet, I am not sure what it is but if you did increase your F & V intake, it could be your answer. <br>  <br>  Not to discourage you, a high fiber diet will help protect you from many diseases including heart disease and colorectal disease.|`|AA11707529	Normallly, gas is either a sign of  constipation, or gaseous veggies, like broccoli and cauliflower.

YM2ED4mfaa	I had the same issue. I was 98 lbs after winter break and I'm 20 yrs old. I lost 10 lbs while away at school and I was super sick. I got injured really easy, so yes, gaining weight is very important for you. Heres how I did it:<br>  <br>  1) eat more protien: meat, nuts, eggs. You dont have to eat fatty foods to gain weight, you can do it in a healthy manner by eating healthy. eat fruits an veggies ALL DAY. Find a protien shake you like, and drink that instead of juice, gatorade or flavored water throughout the day. I eat all day long rather than just 3 times a day. Snack on nuts, yogurt, fruit and anything else I can get my hands on between meals. during meals, be sure to get that protien and sustaining foods. <br>  2) cut back on filling but light foods. Dont eat light, diet or low calorie foods. You dont need to. they will fill you up without giving you the nutirents you need. I drink whole milk, or 2% cottage cheese. No light yogurt or diet drinks. they are filled with synthetic chemicals that arents good for you anyways. <br>  3) work out. Yea, I said work out. The more I work out, the more I weigh. Thats because muscle weighs more than fat, and being as small as you are, you probably have very little muscle mass. You need to get some meat on your bones with strength training. use weights, and do as many reps as possible.|`|YRJShhKraa	Try mixing a bottle of ensure, 2 scoops of ice cream, and a scoop of peanut butter in a blender then drink it like a milk shake.

And the response I received was shocking.<br>  <br>  "I just eat."<br>  <br>  That's what he said. I just eat.<br>  <br>  You MUST know how many calories a day you need for your weight gain goal.<br>  <br>  This person desperately wanted to gain weight and every time I saw him the gym he had some excuse as to why it wasn't going his way. And it was usually related to his metabolism.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you...<br>  <br>  If you want to gain quality weight, you have to eat high quality dense foods and ENOUGH of them. Furthermore... if you want to gain weight without getting fat, then you bulk with the same principles as if you were on a cutting diet. Choose higher-calorie foods when given a choice.<br>  <br>  In my years of experience, when I bulked up and gained weight and fat, the biggest mistake I made was not tracking what I ate. I always tracked my diet when I was on a calorie restricted phase (that was a given) but when I wanted to gain weight I just ate everything I could.<br>  <br>  Have you ever felt that way?<br>  <br>  In order to gain weight, you need to eat more than your usual maintenance calorie intake but not so much as to just store the excess calories and get fat. And you need to eat consistently.<br>  <br>  That should have been your "ah -ha" moment.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight isn't your cue to eat everything under the sun. In order to gain weight, lean mass and not get fat, you need to eat just over what you body needs to maintain. In this manner, you'll provide your body with all the calories it needs to build muscle but you won't give it so much as it stores the excess as fat.<br>  <br>  [ Remember that anything in excess, even protein, can be stored as fat. ]<br>  <br>  The key is to gain healthy weight and minimize the fat gains.<br>  <br>  Tip 2: Grocery Shopping 101<br>  <br>  If you are looking to gain weight, then don't have bare cupboards. Go to your kitchen right now after reading this section and take a look at what you've got in stock.<br>  <br>  Make sure your kitchen is fully stocked with the foods you need to eat. Dense foods work wonders for putting on the weight.<br>  <br>  Examples are whole-grain breads, vegetables such as avocados and potatoes, kidney beans, lean red meat, poultry and fish.<br>  <br>  Bare cupboards = no weight gain!<br>  <br>  Bodybuilding doesn't have to break the bank. Many times you can get bulk items for much cheaper than you think. Packages of tuna, turkey, chicken legs, pasta all are great bulking items that don't cost a ton of money.<br>  <br>  Perishable items like fruits and sugary laden items and condiments are usually things that cost the most.<br>  <br>  Tip 3: Meal Planning for Dummies<br>  <br>  Part of performance nutrition is eating 5-6 times a day. Every 2-3 hours you should be consuming a meal consisting of a lean protein, fibrous/starchy carb and potentially a healthy fat.<br>  <br>  If you really want to gain weight, you need to eat 5-6 times a day! And it needs to be consistent. This means no skipping meals.<br>  <br>  Eating 3 times a day full of bacon and eggs might have worked for some of the past legends but it probably won't do you any good.<br>  <br>  Keeping your metabolism high and your system flushed with nitrogen (protein) will ensure you keep all the muscle you are working to build and that you are consuming slight excess calories for weight gain.<br>  <br>  If you eat a big dinner but skip snacks and have light breakfasts, that is part of the problem. Healthy weight gain only comes from people who are consistent in their eating and don't skip meals.<br>  <br>  Failure to plan your meals ultimately means you won't be eating enough to gain weight.<br>  <br>  Tip 4: Nutrient Variety is Key<br>  <br>  It happens to the best of us... We get used to eating certain foods and we don't budge. For a bulking diet, this can be a killer as it drastically limits the number of calories you can eat. Plus, you will limit the nutrients and vitamins you will be able to intake. Both are essential to maximum healthy weight gain.<br>  <br>  Did anybody ever tell you that nutrients are essential for growth?<br>  <br>  Tip 5: Essential Meal Timing<br>  <br>  While it might be socially acceptable to eat just 3 times a day, that is not acceptable for those who are serious about putting on lean muscle mass without putting on fat.<br>  <br>  You've heard all the benefits of performance nutrition and eating 5-6 times a day but re-read this...<br>  <br>  Quality muscle gain without putting on fat requires a high metabolism AND an excess number of calories.<br>  <br>  In order to do just that, you need to eat frequently.<br>  <br>  That means 5-6 times a day (or more).<br>  <br>  Tip 6: Eat, Eat and Eat [ did I mention eat ]<br>  <br>  Don't feel hungry?<br>  <br>  Eat. Now in most cases, that is against the current movement but in reality, if you want to put on quality mass you have to eat regardless of your hunger levels. Eating based on your mood is not the p
Ieslv5JJaa	As weird as this is going to sound, it happens a lot! when guys are getting off, they aren't thinking properly, and things just come out of their mouths, whether or not they mean it. Next time your giving him a hand job, or a BJ ask him to recite the alphabet and see how "dumb" he becomes. <br>  I had a friend of a friend who was having sex with her really drunk husband and he yelled "just put it in my pussy" (hahahahhaha! sorry, I cant help but laugh hysterically at that..) <br>  <br>  Guys can only think with one head at any given time, whether its the one on their shoulders, or the one in their pants. You can't expect them to speak properly while their member's are being touched.<br>  <br>  I would let it slide. If he does it again, laugh and say "did you mean ..." and see what happens!!<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  ....0....<br>  ..0...0....<br>  .0.....0...<br>  .0.....0..

I wouldn't worry to much about it, because if he didn't mean to say it and you call him out he may get embarrased and then the sex may stop. But, if it is bothering you to this point, just ask him and realize that you may not like the answer. If you ask, you better be willing to accept whatever he says. <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|yyIVrngcaa	wow, guys are usually smarter than that than to mix up their words...all i know is, my bf would probably dump me if i seriously asked him if he was bi or gay....men don't like to feel disrespected, neither humiliated...I'd just brush it off and forget about it.|`|YZ3GtcIZaa	Maybe he wants you to use a finger and do a little prostate massage. Try it, he might enjoy it, I know I do.|`|apzX48W4aa	This happened to my friend. She was having sex with this guy and when he came he shouted out "Oh Chris!"...Who is his best friend.

I would not worry unless he continues to relay messages that might make you think he is on the low down.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|AA11765580	Yes, I think you are overreacting.

That's the origin of "spoonerisms" and other speech convolutions. However, he may have been involved in an internal fantasy where you (or his dream girl) was saying that phrase to him in the fantasy.  Orrrr, he may have been fantasizing about YOU entering him wearing a "strap -on".  Orrr, you may be correct in your suspicions (he is bisexual).  It seems to be more and more socially acceptable for  women to be bisexual in our society today and maybe it is becoming more common for men to be bisexual also.  You could "test it out" by obtaining a porno tape that includes several scenarios (straight;  lesbian; gay etc) and watch it together.  He may try to disguise his preferences but "erections don't lie" if you surprise him with a "gay scene".

0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	I can empathise with your pain. I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, which is a type of neuropathic pain syndrome and I know that it is excruciating. I am wondering actually if that could be what is going on with your foot - do you ever get any change in the colour or temperature of your skin, or any swelling? <br>  <br>  It is hard if you are not dealing with a pain management specialist - I would suggest that you need to get yourself referred to one ASAP. This would be something that you can talk to your GP about, especially if it's going to be so long before you can see your surgeon. Depending on your GPs experience, s/he may be happy to prescribe you medication - there are other drugs that are much more effective against nerve pain than opioid painkillers. But really, you need a pain management doctor as plainly surgery is not the answer to your problem. In terms of other treatments, I can only speak from CRPS experience, but some might be helpful with other nerve pain as well. <br>  <br>  It sounds bizarre, but try Mirror Imagery. Sit with a mirror between your legs so that your painful foot is hidden from view - all you see is your good foot, and a reflection of your good foot. Practice gentle movements of your good foot while watching your 'bad foot (i.e. the reflection) do those same movements in the mirror. It helps some people with CRPS and in other neuropathic pain syndromes, and it can't hurt to try it.<br>  <br>  Your profile doesn't allow any contact, but please email me. I don't know if I can help you at all, but if I can I will. Hang in there.<br>  <br>  EDIT: What did the pain management doctor do? Have you tried antidepressant or anticonvulsant drugs? Both of these drug types are well known to help with nerve pain. Has anyone ever mentioned something like a spinal cord stimulator to you? Ketamine? Desensitisation therapy for your foot? <br>  <br>  I know how much it hurts to be touched, but you HAVE to work on that or it's only going to get worse. Start out with something really soft, like cotton wool, and gently brush it against your skin. Increase the pressure and the coarseness of the materials you use as you are able to tolerate it. Warm and cool water baths can also be helpful with this. I know it hurts - I've lived this in some shape or form since I was 14 years old. More recently, it is in all my limbs, so believe me when I say that I understan where you are coming from.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	I have had problems with foot pain for almost 20 yrs or more...It comes and goes but lately its seems to be there all the time.I was told it was a Morton's Neroma and was treating it like that..(.and not working that well with any results ..)But recently ,  I fell and had back problems and when I had an MRI recently they told me I had a bone spur on my spinal column and that it probably was causing the nerve pain in my foot...That would make sense since the last few shots of cortazone in my foot didn't help at all...Now I am deciding if I should proceed on having a lambatectamy on my back ...My regular doctor and my back Dr. told me it might help... and it is pretty easy to do anymore...I also had 2 foot surgery's with not good results and I swore I wouldn't have anymore...But , I never thought of it as a back problem before...Check it out.. He told me that my nerves were being pinched in my spinal column and he actually did an initial test with shots to see if it works..It actually did but didn't last more than a few days...He told me I have 3 choices...Live with the pain, get another shot to see if it works or do the surgery on my back...I am still taking pain medicine and hoping I find out more...GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!! I hope this helps you ,,as it did me...Take care and let me know...( I also have spinal stinosis that is making it worse...) I am 53 yrs old and sick of this foot pain so much I already said to just cut the darn thing off when it gets bad...I also have my podiatrist getting me orthodic and special sneakers ...I was told to work out more and lose more weight , but not by walking...that is one of the worst things to do right now with my back...(My back doesn't hurt much anymore , but my foot is worse than ever..) <br>  You might have pinched nerves in your lumbar 4 and 5 on you spine .. like I do . I wouldn't have ever thought my foot pain was a result of my back not right...Check it out on computer ...It's interesting for sure.|`|GbnIA76Maa	Who has this kind of pain and 13 SURGERIES! + It's still hurting? :S<br>  i dont think anyone can answer this qustion then!<br>  but go see your GP or go old fashioned and take pain killers. But then again you could wear a foot support?|`|eZVZSkyTaa	talk to a doctor, or take pain reliver... even though i have never had that kind of pain... im still gonna try to help|`|6zCalKvKaa	Extreme pain calls for extreme solutions.

BG8vMyZjaa	I haven't but my mother in law had emphysema.<br>  1.  She did get out locally and also in  my brother in law's car further afield.<br>  2.  She was treated the same in a way, but her physical limitation through breathlessness had to be taken into account.<br>  3.  She did avoid the cold as it made her cough which was painful to listen to.<br>  4.  I think my father in law let her down, but her children definitely did not.<br>  5.  She got a bit fed up with not being able to go upstairs, couldn't do the things she used to do.<br>  6.  Don't live in or frequent a polluted atmosphere (she had lived in a mining area in the 1940s when the air was full of smoke, coal dust, her father and brothers all smoked..<br>  7.  There were no programs then, nor was there much help available.  There is much more information about now  and the British Lung Foundation offers help.<br>  8.  Yes, she did have to stop and rest every few steps some days.<br>  9.  Lonely?  I guess she did feel lonely and fed up at times.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is about someone other than myself, so is not a first hand 'experience'.|`|UI9GV7k1aa	Yes to every question. People have abandoned us to a large degree. Friends and family. Although we have made new friends. My husband like his time alone. He did quit smoking right away and tries to avoid anything that smells or chemicals. Some people like my mother in law can tolerate the cold much better than my husband. I recommend activia or kefir to strengthen the immunity against catching every cold flu or germ.
f0d9913ce405e7a9de76fe44dcf46013aa	Depends on where the knot is. I get them sometimes right at the apex of my lips. There are glands all over the place down there and they can become clogged or get little infections. It may get really sore and drain like an abscess or just disappear again.<br>  <br>  I will say this don't play with it! You will regret it! Just monitor it and don't obsess. It's very doubtful it's anything more than a clogged poor or gland if you aren't sexually active|`|O2s8tLQzaa	It's called "Clitoris" lady.|`|wZSMDrCfaa	you have what is commonly known as vaginitis knotus syndrome. rub some vagisil on it and all will be fine

RvPuRmqAaa	This is called DOMS - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, which usually occurs 1 to 2 days after a workout, especially after introducing your body to a new workout that the muscles are not accustomed to.     It is not the same as the muscle burn you feel while actually doing the exercise (that is the result of lactic acid build up that brings about a burning sensation).    DOMS is thought to be caused by microscopic tears (and sometimes inflamation) in the muscle that is the result of eccentric muscle contractions. An example of an eccentric phase of a contraction is the lowering of a dumbell during a bicep curl.     There are several recommended recovery methods. Do what works best, which can include:     - Passing of time (a few days)   - Light stretching   - Rest   - Active recovery (exercising at a lesser intensity)   - Advil or Tylenol   - Ice    If after 5 days or so you are still feeling no relief consult your doctor as it may be a sign of injury.|`|6LtmIxhCaa	Think of how you just did your body good.

2EvkFausaa	Nope. You are not overweight. You have a beautiful, thick, full-figured body. You are built they way a woman should be built. You don't want to weight 125 pounds. Stay where you are. you are HOT. And to top it all off, you have pretty blue eyes. Show some confidence girl!    BTW, I just checked out your profile description, and I noticed you are from South Lyon and graduated there. You also said you went to Hartland high. Well, my best friend graduated from Hartland High and now attends Michigan tech. I myself went to Milford High and, like you, was part of the class of 2008. Oh, and you can tell this to your South Lyon buddies:    MILFORD 40  SOUTH LYON 14    we POWN you guys in football!! HAHAHAHA!!!!!|`|KozoNqpsaa	I read a height/weight chart once in a health magazine that went like this: a woman who is 5' tall, with an "average" build/bone structure should weigh approximately 100 lbs. For each inch taller, add 5 lbs. For example, if you were 5'4", you should weigh about 120 lbs.     That was a few years ago and personally, I think that's pretty thin and probably on the low side for most women!    Now obviously there is much controversy over what an average build would be. Large breasts, full hips, broad shoulders, etc...can all play into that and of course add pounds. I would say that if you and your doctor both agree that you are healthy and at a good weight, you should be satisfied. However, if you feel tired alot, are not exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet, then it may be that you need to shed a few pounds.    Cheers to being both happy and healthy no matter what size you are!|`|wjS3GtOYaa	:S    yes. yes u are - be my weightloss buddy?|`|2MnqCwzLaa	sweetie, your not over weight.   I know many people like you.|`|3beedf58567b76d1dda5de20739d5268aa	The average weight for someone of your height is about 115-125 pounds. You may be a little overweight, and that's also taking into consideration that you carry most of your weight on your torso region. So yes, you are overweight, but it's not too late to change that.
xM5bwK50aa	I had a stomach ulcer at about that age. I went to a doctor, and the first thing they told me was not to have caffeine (coffee and chocolate), and not to smoke. So yes, make sure he stops smoking, it just irritates it more. The doctor gave me some pills with some sort of basic substance to counteract the overproduction of acid in my stomach. The extra acid is what's dissolving the protective layer of mucus in the stomach and it hurts when this mucus is gone. I would suggest taking him to a doctor (just your local clinic) and getting some pills. It helped me and it took about a week or two.
AA12134591	You don't want to hear this..... But, you did ask.....  You are not nearly so "burned out with life" as you are... burned out on drugs... and, you are plagued by a very personal looping scenario that has you thinking that you are above most everything around you...  The reason that you "focus" so much better when you have these substances in you ... is... you are hooked to them... every single addict I've ever known ...says the exact same thing... "they just make  it all make better sense, man...and, I can deal with things SOooo much easier"..... sound familiar ?  If you've been at all of these substances for all this length of time... is there any wonder that there is this "gap" between you and your folks... hell, you've left the realm of any kind of 'understanding' between them and you when you opted to recluse into this drug induced state that has them on the outside of your....loop....  Same with the 'teachers thing'.... same with the other people that "talk and don't make any sense to you".... it not that they're not making sense... it's just.... they're not making sense TO YOU....  You are in severe need of some real intervention... and, if you don't get it... you are in major trouble... and it won't be long until it WILL be... all over for you... with little hope of ever making your way back to the real world.....  Better start talking to someone... real soon.... someone with some kind of genuine contact with "what's up" and how to get you sidelined long enough to get a plan in the mix to halt this demise !!    ? ////|`|uXP1Xij4aa	You need to get out of where you are. You need to move to Japan.|`|gBUJqBuYaa	Hell I've been burnt out on life since I was 15. Whaddaya gonna do|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	You really need to seek counseling for more than one reason.    1.  Speaking to someone about will help you sort out your feelings and help to organize them so that you can function better.    2.  If you are depressed, they can give you medications that will help you in a good way, not the bad way that illegal drugs can do to you.     I do not believe that you should drop out of school when you only have 3 months left to go.  You will be kicking yourself if you do.  It is easier to get a job when you have a diploma.  You could try to get a GED, but why go through that hassle?      You should really talk to your parents without using a tone in your voice or judging them, etc.    Sit down with them.  They love you even though they may be upset at all you have done illegally or how your attitude toward them has been.    Tell them that you apologize for your behavior and tell them you want to change.  Tell them you have been doing drugs and you can't focus and that you really need their help right now.  Tell them you don't need them to judge you on what you have done, you know you need help now.      Try to give them a compliment on a daily basis.  I will pray for you and your courage and strength to keep going.    You can fight this, but you have to be willing to stop the drugs, start counseling, and accept the help that your family is willing to give you.  You must accept the consequences of your actions and move on.    Hugs to you.  Pray about it also, tell God that you are a sinner and you have done many wrongs, etc... Ask him to forgive you and to help you go in the right direction.  He loves you so much and unconditionally.  He loves you no matter how much you screw up.  He loves you so much that he gave his only son to die for our sins.      Jesus died for you.  Ask Jesus into your heart and to help you even if you don't know what kind of help you need.  He will help you.    God Bless.|`|AA10506154	Maybe you should get out of where you are. A different environment can change your attitude. I lived in northern California till I was 15. I was pretty crazy back then. I never did homework. I was the one doing extra credit at the end of the semester so that I don't get an F. I moved to Japan, and that changed me. I'm not saying "Go to Japan". Now I live in Florida, and it's pretty chill. You just need to get away from your situation. I'd tell you to join the Air Force, but you need to get your depression and ADHD diagnosed first. Look into "Habitat for Humanity". Volunteering to help others less fortunate can make you appreciate what you have.|`|chOS6EO0aa	Please speak to your parents. See if you can write them a letter if you don't want to speak to them personally. Or talk to your school counsellor or a family friend/relative for help. It seems like an impossible task to get help, but it is not. Try to figure out why you are not happy by journalling, praying,meditating,yoga..Just sit down and write down everything about your life that you dislike. After making that list, make another list with things that you feel (eg..I hate my family) and things that you know (eg..my parents support me by feeding me and putting a roof over my head) or things that can't be changed and things that can. You will find out that the things that can be changed will be more than the ones that can't. Then see if you can figure out a plan on how to get help to change those things. I have had a tough life too for about 19 years, but through it all I was glad I made the choice to help myself be happy and sane, which is exactly what you are doing. So congratulations on YOUR DECISION to get help, and may you find the peace you need. Remember you already have everything you need to succeed.|`|yxo31Qucaa	im so sorry that you feel so bad. im suffering from depression at the moment, so i kind of know how you feel.  im 28 and ive had to move back in with my parents for a bit and we always argue. it sucks! and i also used to take cocaine, speed and pills  etc etc, and yes i believe it's messed my head up too, but you must go and talk to someone. i didn't think i could but ive got an appointment with a councilor soon, so maybe try that. don't feel ashamed or embarrassed, that's what they are there for. your so young, you've got your whole life ahead of you...don't waste it. please go to your doctor and speak to some one. i promise they will be able to help you.  Try this website below, my doctor recommended it to me, its like a self help programme. so if you cant face talking to someone then maybe this will help? Good Luck xxxx xxx|`|zhOeamtgaa	You believe in God?  Try to pray, to go to church discuss with the priest.You are special.Be smart give you a good chance...

0GDJHxenaa	Withdrawing from classes may cause a lot of problems from financial to motivational.  You will be off your crutches in May, and the break in classes will make you less likely to return.  Putting your life on hold for 6 months is risky.  <br>       As it's March, ice becomes less of an issue.  See if you can rent/borrow a wheelchair if you feel it will help.  They are easier to go long distances, but they don't do stairs.<br>       Another idea - start asking people who sit near you about carpooling options.  Stick it out, and you will be a lot better off.|`|fa5e1b3d02f5edf70a98698df7635b10aa	It might make it easier on you if you get a friend to help you out so they can drop you right off at the door.  You could get alot of friends to help so you will always have someone to help.
juU6nJqUaa	I think it means that you need to have more tests done.  The Lymph nodes are part of a system that becomes active when you are fighting some type of infection.  <br>  <br>  Depending on which lymph node, it could be any number of things.  Since you have had problems for so long, maybe you can get them to check this out further.|`|Jg5PB2Zwaa	hi,<br>  <br>  sorry to hear about your pain. i have a swollen lymph node in my neck since i was 16. at first it caused me some pain in my neck and down my shoulder as it was pressing against a nerve, swollen lymph nodes are nothing to worry about as long as they do not turn cancerous. mine took 2 years to go down but its still slightly swollen, it does not cause me any more pain, the pain can be scary because it feels so deep inside but if the doctor says there is nothing seriously wrong you should believe him. there are certain procedures that can damp the pain. it is estimated that over 80% of the population have swollen nodes in the neck or armpits and never know about it. if it was to be serious im sure you would have had other symptoms by now since it has been 6 months, but explain to your doctor that you are worried
lvhQeDrwaa	Most probably yes.<br>  Get immediate medical attention, atleast an EKG.
B12E4rYiaa	If you're trying to gain or build muscle you use them anytime and more often to get protein and calories as long as you also have a balanced diet they cannot hurt you. If you are trying to lose weight you drink maybe one and drink it early since they are high in calories and are more for gain than loss.<br>  <br>  I would not drink it just before the workout, but a couple of hours before. And anytime after the workout.|`|G1OSlub8aa	With protein, you body cannot handle more than 20-25 grams at a time. The rest will end up in the toilet. If your trying to build muscle here is a good formula to use to see how much you need each day.<br>  <br>  Divide your bodyweight by 2 and then multiply that number by 1.2. That is how many grams of protein you need per day if you are lifting hard.<br>  <br>  Take a protein shake after your workout for muscle recovery.|`|MPlPZ6U2aa	depends on how hard you train and how much.. I train 7 days a week.. i take 3 protien shakes a day at 60grams each.. also there are different kinds of protiens. fast and slow digesting.. after you workout or lift you want whey protien ( i use isopure) .

iK3YYRaTaa	Your full blown diabetic. Whats the problem about your numbers. Aren't you taking meds. for it. I would try to get down to below 120 at the least. Alcohol lowers blood sugars. I have diabetes and I drink 6 beers a day. My HBA1C runs between 5.4 to 5.9 .I don't know what 2 pegs mean? 2 shots perhaps?<br>  <br>  As for diet a low Glycemic Diet is in order. In fact all people should be on this way of eating.

But here's the bad news, Its called EXERCISE!At least 30 minutes a day for at least 5 days a week. Preferably 7 days a week.<br>  <br>  Nordic walking is one great exercise. Get two ski poles or pvc 3/4 inch or just plain sticks. Walk with them. You don't have to push hard , just do it naturably. You will build muscles in both upper and lower body. It helps in insulin resistance. <br>  Get with it pardner, its for life. When we are diagnosed as diabetic we start out as if we already had our first heart attack.|`|AA12318686	You could try a non alcohol beer, like O'Dool's, not sure of the spelling,but that's how it is pronounced. <br>  <br>  Alcohol, in beer and whiskey is pure carbohydrate, your body converts it to sugar! <br>  <br>  You could drink the alcohol and then test your blood sugar and then take short acting insulin on a sliding scale, or on an insulin pump. <br>  <br>  It truly would be best to give up the drinking. But, if you can't or refuse to, then, talk to your doctor and tell him that you drink alcohol regularly, don't want to give it up, but want the insulin coverage for it, to avoid the complications of diabetes...<br>  <br>  Please see a nutritionist about the dietary questions. And for support, you really need it, I Hate this disease! This is Nothing to mess around with. Don't kid yourself. If you don't take this seriously, you are going to be the one who suffers, nobody else. Take care.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	You should speak to your doctor about this.  You have diabetes, 150 in not borderline.  Have you had an HbA1c test?<br>  <br>  Alcohol may cause very high or very low blood sugar in people with diabetes.  If you choose to drink alcohol you MUST monitor your blood sugar very carefully and very frequently.  The problem is that having a buzz from alcohol and feeling light headed from low blood sugar feel the same.  Also, lying in the floor in a coma looks just like lying on the floor because you have passed out from being drunk!|`|EeTs9DqUaa	If your blood glucose is 150 you are not border line you have FULL BLOWN diabetes!

bdiSM1UXaa	I'm assuming by "under my genitals" you mean the outskirts still but closer to you a-hole..If this is correct, inner thighs and hair under genitals is okay, there is nothing wrong with it. However, if the hair growth seems to be abnormal compared to what you have seen so far in your life, it might have been caused by a hormonal change or imbalance. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause.... Depending on your age which I'm assuming is around puberty, you can have extra hair growth. I do not shave under my genitals, but I certainly wax and do not think too much of it.|`|O2s8tLQzaa	It's normal. Don't shave it.

But you shouldn't for the following reasons, even though your Motor Vehicles Department might still issue you a license. <br>  <br>  We need both eyes for depth perception. This is what helps us assess distances. When you have vision in only one eye, you can't gauge distances very well. You'll easily misjudge when to brake or accelerate in a safe and timely way. <br>  <br>  You also lose side (peripheral) vision. When you drive, you need to be able to see right and left out of the corner of your eyes. If you can't do that on one side, you won't be able to see pedestrians crossing the street from that side, or see cars approaching from your blind side when you want to change lanes, or see other developments for which you might need to take an emergency action.|`|T4uZeVXjaa	It depends on the laws where you live and what kind of licence.<br>  <br>  In most places you only need one eye for a general licence.  Requirements for truck, bus and taxi may be more strict.|`|un0C52G8aa	Yes, it is possible. My sister is nearly blind in one eye as the result of unsuccessful attempts to treat her amblyopia. She has a driver's license and drives a car.

lzcglDnMaa	I have used it and it does work right away. If your taking antibiotics, then they should start kicking in. It usually take about 48 hours for them to start working. You can gargle some salt water, this will help get rid of it sooner. When I have a really bad sore throat, I take Tylenol Sore Throat. It seems to work right away. When you swallow it, it coats your throat to help with the pain. Try taking a pain relief pill, like tylenol or ibuprofen. Good luck to you. Hope you feel better soon.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	I have used chloraseptic and it was very good... Hit the spot straight away..

XrcTtodeaa	Technically, Migraine isn't a headache, but a disease/disorder.  The headache is a symptom; but is unique in the severity of its pain.  With a stroke you would probably have some numbness.  The symptoms you're describing sound a little more like Migraine, but I would call your doctor.  Check out the symptoms listed on the websites below.|`|QxzpEfhKaa	A migraine is a very severe headache.<br>  <br>  A stroke is a blood clot in the brain.  <br>  <br>  2 completely different things.|`|ZS38T8M7aa	A migraine is an extreme headache that often times needs medication in order to go away.<br>  <br>  A blood clot usually is the cause of a stroke..|`|Jg5PB2Zwaa	hi, judging by your symptoms you do not have a stroke.. a stroke manifests as deeper neurological symptoms such as paralysis on one side of the face causing a very noticeable drooping effect, slurred speech or the loss of strength in one arm or an entire side of the body. a headache can be the first sign but a stroke usually runs its full course within 48 hours. you have what sounds like a migraine but if it is your first headache ever, or different to any headache you have had before then go see your doctor, otherwise, until you show other more serious symptoms, try relaxing in a dim room and take painkillers
AA11432707	Maybe for little kids.  It's not that big a deal.<br>  <br>  If you want your LP done quickly, ask to have an anesthesiologist do it.  We put needles in spines all the time, and are darn good at it. (Of course, we usually put medicine in, not take fluid out, but it involves getting the needle in the same space)<br>  <br>  I can usually get a spinal placed in about 3-4 minutes.<br>  <br>  It's not safe to stick needles in spines in anesthetized patients. We sedate our patients before sticking them, but they must be awake to provide feedback about paresthesias.|`|AA11146632	NO. is the simple answer.|`|mh48WVe7aa	I had to get 2 lumbar punctures and the doctor said that the next time they probably will have to because I'm getting it done at a pediatric hospital, so yes.
WXExyAlWaa	A GP can prescribe them. Probably your best bet would be to pick a doctor's clinic that is near to you and make an appointment. Explain how you're feeling and open a line of communication. If you're wanting an ongoing prescription, it's best to have a steady doctor who can get to know you and keep an eye on how you're doing.|`|t2LOcPkLaa	i believe the family doctor can prescribe them, but they will probably refer you to a psychiatrist (not a psychologist, they can't prescribe pills) for them. if you're taking them you should be in therapy for a little while anyways. since you said you don't have a doctor, do you know anyone else's doctor that might be able to refer you to a psychiatrist? i wouldn't recommend just randomly choosing someone. i went to 3 different people over the course of time. feel better.  xx|`|QUktpkPQaa	A family doc or psychiatrist can prescribe them either in a private office or clinic.

Depression is a sensitive topic, a doctor or psychiatrist will as ask you several questions before prescribing which you should take based on your symptoms. For instance I have a friend that takes a combo for anxiety, depression & doesn't have a side affect for gaining weight. Some antidepressant have side affects, it is important to research first ask the doctor what they are so he/she can choose one for you. Sorry but you have to be evaluated first...|`|J4BxsLSXaa	Well u think wrong if u think that u shall not ask a doctor because you should,Antidepressants are dangeruous with many sides.
