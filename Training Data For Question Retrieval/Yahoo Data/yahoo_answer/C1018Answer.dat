Occasionally I would keep a close look at the baseball standings, but most likely it's an NBA TV-xtravaganza!!<br>  <br>  And also answer questions in here.|`|yt05KPhBaa	Basketball season is never over.|`|BIyJUmM9aa	I start playing tennis for more than recreation<br>  <br>  =]]|`|AA10263761	Go Into Baseball Mode<br>  Then College football starts<br>  And we Lead that into NFL Season <br>  And the Cycle begins again|`|e5W2S6tCaa	Yes, I watch Baseball...As the Baseball season ends I start watching American Football. As NFL ends I watch NHL and NBA parallel y. Throughout the year there will be some entertaining games going on and I watch them all. And also while watching the club games we also watch the college football and College basketball which are also interesting|`|sj8EM9ejaa	i go play ball my self about 4 hrs a day then i watch baseball and then when that is over i watch football then hockey then basketball!|`|V48H3aWQaa	I hibernate until football season.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Baseball is in full swing by that point.

m4yyCDNCaa	I'm not saying he's Gods gift to football.. but a lot of these people on here who hate on him probably have only seen him play in one or two games.Plus they don't know or care about the three freshman and 2 sophomores who were his offensive line because a lot of the starters and their backups were hurt. All they see is preseason number 1, then 3 losses and he's the problem because he was supposed to be the star. Maybe he's not a #1 pick, but he's not putting himself at that status, and he's one of the better qbs in a draft that doesn't have many great choices.  <br>  <br>  & MoMass didn't drop every pass...not this past year. He did have that problem his sophomore year though.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Honestly, there's nothing wrong with Matt Stafford.<br>  <br>  But there's nothing great about him, and that's what people are getting hung up on. Could he be a good NFL QB? YES. Is he really worthy of a #1 pick? NOT REALLY.|`|GmRscBkPaa	He looks inaccurate to me, and never seems to throw a good spiral.<br>  <br>  Accuracy is EVERYTHING in the NFL!!!  How many times do you throw a 70 yd bomb in a game?  Maybe once or twice.  A cannon of an arm is nothing.<br>  <br>  You need to read the defense, pick up blitzes, and hit your target.  That's it.  All while getting creamed by big DE's...<br>  <br>  Stafford will crack under this pressure.  I'm sure of it.|`|acaAycEXaa	No one hates him, he just isn't that good.<br>  <br>  Big, nasty SEC defenses? What a homer, dude!<br>  <br>  More like small and thuggy.
S0KbFkCPaa	Especially work mentally on forcing yourself to wait on the starting blocks until the starter's gun goes off. The starter's gun usually fires about 3 seconds after the starter says "Set!" especially in final heats, so it is best to use a 1-2 second window after the word "Set!" is said, where you make yourself very still to avoid the chance of "anticipating" the start and going off the blocks before the gun.<br>  <br>  You don't want to feel the shame and stigma of a first false start (now in the newer track and field rules, that can be charged to the whole field), or even worse, a second false start that could get you disqualified.<br>  <br>  In the run itself....<br>  In the first 30 meters, start going towards your maximum speed of 20 mph.<br>  In the next 40 meters, peak at the 20-mph speed to try to chase up with better sprinters. At that point, you better look very quickly left and right to see if other sprinters are about to pass you.<br>  In the next 20 meters, start to slow down your speed to about 15 mph but if competitors are gaining on you, don't slow down or you could lose the race.<br>  <br>  However....<br>  In the preliminary, quarter final, and semi final heats, you can reach your peak speed in the first 60 meters, and shut yourself down for the next 40 meters to save energy for the final 100m heats. You see Olympian sprinters do this a lot.<br>  <br>  Hope all of this helps and happy sprinting.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Do not hold your breath. It is necessary to take deep full breaths while sprinting.<br>  When you are at top speed try to relax, don't try to run faster, if you are running at top speed and try to run faster you will slow down.<br>  You should be at top speed somewhere between 40 to 50 meters.<br>  After that you try to maintain and not slow down as much as the other runners.<br>  The race is very short, get out fast, get to top speed, and don't tense up.

THe ones that comprehend better are the Freo fans. We are exposed to it in all sports media ALL THE TIME the expectations and how disappointing this team is eery year, yet every year the bookies come out touting them up. Freo were like equal second faves for the flag for a while before last season, I'm still not sure where the logic for that came from. And guess what? consensus is they'll be in the eight and a threat this year, again. but WHY? what have we got to base that idea on the team is an absolute joke they are the ones that should be relegated if one team were to be relegated|`|2s244jGgaa	Fremantle, since the eagles own WA.|`|94d210326a19c672cd98b1a32e43da78aa	Whoever came last in the previous season - at the very least this would stop tanking and would also make the 'dead' games at the tail of the season come alive.

Congratulations for the Cowboys for ridding of that virus.|`|f9soMMuiaa	I guessed they wanted Romo and Whitten to continue their "secret meetings" without interruption. Hence TO got the boot. But I guess they still got Roy Williams and a whole lump sum of $$$.|`|UgnMjtYDaa	I dont think it was a mistake at all with all the Wr's in this years draft. I think they should pick up Marvin Harrison to mentor some young recievers that would be cool plus he's good for some td's|`|C9r94iTmaa	i think this was a great move by jones even though he betrayed owens.  owens is like a time bomb and he exploded.  he was being mean to everyone associated with the dallas cowboys.  he took control of the locker room and he never listened to anyone.  yeah, he's a good player but he divided the locker room and ruined team chemistry.  i think team chemistry is much more important than talent because without team chemistry then players would be selfish and they wouldn't be able to coexist.  even though i don't like jerry jones, he is realizing that team chemistry is one of the most important assets of teams.|`|g6MiGWuJaa	hardly anyone likes t o|`|FZRWMc3Baa	Smartest thing Dallas has done in a decade.|`|LLXfaOK9aa	Are you kidding? I was pissed when Jerry signed that a-hole 3 years ago! As a true Cowboys' fan, you can never forgive him for disgracing the star the way he did earlier in the decade. This is one of the greatest moments in Cowboys' history and I think I am going to celebrate. It is the first thing the Cowboys have done right all offseason, though the timing was terrible given the two best wide receivers are off the market (Houshmanzeddeh and Lavernueous Coles). Now where do we turn at number 2? Crayton? Decent number two, but still lacks explosion. Austin? Maybe, but can he stay healthy? I would love to trade for Boldin! Package up a pick with SS Roy Williams and ship that useless turd out of big D. I don't think we have the cap room to give Boldin what he would like though. The greatest thing that happens here is this finally allows the team to build chemistry. T.O. was the very thing that snagged any chance of team chemistry last year.|`|otncH1phaa	Maybe your parents should have taught you loyalty..at least your father should have.|`|OKqlSICkaa	they shouldve got rid of tony homo. T.O. maybe complained but he showed up and played every game full speed. no one can criticize his work ethics. maybe he went too far sometime but he was a guy who just knew the team's potential and wanted to win. very stupid mistake!!!|`|BzSmD7LNaa	What's new? All Dallas fans are bandwagoners. You aren't alone. I'm just the opposite. I might even start to like the Cowboys now since they have finally gotten rid of that garbage human being.|`|juCFsWieaa	That's what some people said when Philly released T.O. I'm a Philly fan.

6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Dear lord I go away for a few days and this section gets even worst with nutriders...<br>  <br>  "BJJ trains every aspect of street fighting.." Really like takedowns, striking, weapon defense, defense to biting and eye gouges, multiple opponents? Oh wait, they don't train any of those things... 90% of BJJ class is on the ground, with about 10% on takedowns. Some schools do BASIC covers and defenses to strikes to close the distance.<br>  <br>  Here is what you have to look at, first off there is no definate either way.<br>  <br>  First off whomever controls the takedown is in a HUGE advantage to begin with, they get to have dominant position. Being that you can also easily break bones, cause concussions, and collapse lungs with throws and slams, and that they spend much more time on takedowns, you would have to give an advantage to Judoka.<br>  <br>  Of course, it depends, are you assuming that both of them know the other is a BJJ/Judo guy, are or they strangers. The element of surprise can work in both people's favor.<br>  <br>  If they know what the other has it could be a stalemate, or could go either way. I know many BJJ players who just prefer to pull guard against good Judo players in competetion out of fear of getting thrown or slammed. Pulling guard in a street setting is a bad idea, you put you back on much harder ground, and your opponent can still hit you in the face, and have leverage.<br>  <br>  A good Judo player is going to have submission defense against a good BJJ player, knows what he will be going for, and has a solid base. It makes him hard to sweep, and allows him to stay in the pocket punching from up top. (Wonder why wrestlers with basic submission defense can beat the tar out of BJJ players, they control the takedown, and have a good base to keep from being swept)<br>  <br>  If they don't know each other is a skilled BJJ/Judo player then it can go a lot of ways.<br>  <br>  The BJJ guy is more willing to stand up and engage someone whom they think they have the grappling advantage, not realizing someone is a Judoka means they will tie up and most likely get thrown. If they manage to get past the stun and avoid injury, they will still have to start in a bad position.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind most Judo throws end up with the thrower in a dominant position, or still standing. A competetive Judoka actually has a great advantage because by nature they will go to the ground with their throw landing into a pin or submission set up. <br>  <br>  However, an overconfident Judoka could just as easily get caught sleeping with a weak takedown, or by putting himself in a position that he wouldn't put himself against another grappler. He could be set up into a submission before he has time to realize that the guy he is fighting actually knows what he is doing.<br>  <br>  Natural ability comes in to play a lot as well, as does experience levels, athleticism, aggressiveness etc.<br>  <br>  There are Judo guys and BJJ guys who by simple nature can hit hard, all those could be moot if one of them knocks the other out with a punch.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, yes, there are many ways for a Judo person to beat a BJJ person in a street fight. There are also ways for the BJJ person to beat a Judo person.<br>  <br>  In the end it matters more about the actual practitioner then the art, and luck plays a large factor in it as well. No one art will win out every time.<br>  <br>  Helio lost to Kimura, possibly the best Judoka there ever was. But keep in mind he fought a draw, and won a match against another Judoka before Kimura.<br>  <br>  Rickson lost to Judoka Ron Tripp by getting tossed around in a Sambo match.<br>  <br>  However Royce beat Remco Parduel a Judoka who outweighed him by a 100lbs.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't have used the Karo example, he hasn't lost to a BJJ guy yet, and has never been submitted. He has beaten two BJJ guys (Matt Serra and Nick Diaz) but by decision. For what it is worth.<br>  <br>  Gamburyan also has never been submitted, but he has lost because of injury to Nate Diaz, however he got the injury by slamming Nate...<br>  <br>  Karo and Manny aren't the best examples.<br>  <br>  (edit)<br>  <br>  Darb D: I know you enjoy using multiple accounts to thumbs people down that don't agree with you, but you might not want to be so blatant about it by giving yourself the exact same amount of thumbs up.<br>  <br>  By the way, I laugh my @ss off knowing that you are logging into different accounts, then finding the question and thumbing me down... why don't you use your other 4 accounts and make it 8 like have been doing... what a joke.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	does someone seriously think biting an ear can win a fight?<br>  <br>  judo concentrates on taking someone to the ground in a traditional setting<br>  <br>  BJJ concentrates on winning fights on the ground with street fighting in mind as a matter of fact its taught more like a street fighting situation than most other thing<br>  <br>  never state defense as your primary strength<br>  <br>  how is this judo guy going to win the fight? bjj trains all aspects of modern street fighting striking|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Judo learns nearly everything about ground submission as BJJ practitioner does, it's just that lots of judo schools these days are plagued by McDojo-ism like Karate and TKD.<br>  The other problem also lies with Judo schools that focus on competition and thus neglect the whole ground submission training altogether (just like TKD school that neglect training in punching altogether since they don't score punches in some TKD competition)<br>  <br>  Traditional judoka has as much ability to fight on the ground or at the very least capable of defending oneself from ground submission.<br>  A clean throw by a judoka on a concrete floor or ashpalt parking lot will end the fight right there right then.<br>  <br>  Plus, BJJ founder Helio Gracie (RIP) was considered a judoka and was beaten by great judo legend Kimura, and his name was used for that technique used to submit Helio in BJJ.<br>  <br>  So yeah, a good judoka from a good school could beat a BJJ practitioner and visa versa depends on individual. After all, Karo Parisyan and his cousin Manny Gamburyan are both judokas and they have beaten and got beaten by BJJ practitioners during their MMA career.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://judoinfo.com/kimura3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://judoinfo.com/kimura3.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSPL2BFepgU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSPL2BFep...</a>|`|AFNgR9jTaa	Really depends on the level of each but I will say unless the Judo guy does an amazing throw, the BJJ will win on the ground. Mainly I say this because when Helio Gracie developed GJJ/BJJ he incorporated many judo throws.|`|Ar2o3P37aa	I train jiu-jitsu, and have trained judo in the past and would say hands down jiu-jitsu would win.  Although judo players have some awesome takedowns, they typically train in a sporting fashion.  They stay in bounds, and frequently start over do to stalemate.  In BJJ we always go full go without regard for walls or boundaries.  Also, most Bjj people have some takedown ability, and can submit people in transition to the ground with something like a guillotine.  I love the sport of judo, I just think Bjj is more effective in a fight.|`|MQmQTl0haa	I'm going to go with no on that one. Basically BJJ is useless on the streets.<br>  <br>  ie. multiple opponents, BJJ pulls guard and gets his head kicked in by another opponent.<br>  <br>  ie. wrestling/judo, BJJ gets slammed into concrete, fight over.<br>  <br>  ie. any kind of striking defeats BJJ<br>  <br>  ie. BJJ guarantees that any kind of weapon attack will be fatal to the BJJ practitioner.<br>  <br>  So basically BJJ is useless.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	No way.  BJJ will look for the quick take down and once you're on the ground and even if you have a good D on the ground, you'll make a small mistake against a master BJJ fighter and you'll be tapping really quick.|`|TnTXGNyMaa	it depends on the person, but i would guess that the bjj guy would win for the fact that bjj teaches you how to finish on the ground and what judo does is take people to the ground.|`|lfGYc3UAaa	This all depends on the person (fighter) who ever is more trained or more fit will win the fight, i would however vouch for BJJ  because a BJJ fighter would know many submissions in many different angles and position.|`|AcSi8FAaaa	i whuld say Judo if does  not mess up <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqK5V00_ZUnIG2hgZoygdfLty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304211004AAAAcY0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|6p9I889Iaa	judo wins<br>  <br>  hip throw then soccer kicks beats flopping onto your back and opening your legs any day|`|rsE1m7aOaa	nope, judo would make a mistake on the ground after a takedown.|`|iK0V092maa	All depends on the individuals. Traditional judo has a ground game but a lot of that is not taught due to the competition aspect. Just like taekwondo guys mainly kicking when there are a whole lotta hand techniques and forms.<br>  <br>  People say there is no best art, only the best fighter. So yeah, a judo guy who has the right skills and ability could beat a BJJ guy.|`|ULgO4VaEaa	yes it can. bjj cam form judo. and doesnt do half the techqiues we do in judo. besides we have striking techniques as we get more advance bjj doesnt.|`|34RxkN6eaa	na you'd be fucked after the take down. i really don't think you'd have a chance|`|LUnscegvaa	Depends on the person.<br>  <br>  Bjj came from traditional kodokan judo,if you can find a judo club that trains a lot in ground work then there is no difference.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|hqgM6gcKaa	depends on the person. in a street fight anything goes. a street fighter can just bite the judo guys ear and that would be the end of the fight.

gdqgVQdKaa	In professional wrestling, a pop refers to the reaction of the crowd, often integrated into the show. It is measured by the amount of cheers or derision a wrestler gets during his entrance, interviews, and in-ring performance (especially when a trademark spot is performed by the wrestler). There are many kinds of pops.<br>  <br>  Like he said "cheap pops" like Mick Foley dropping the name of the town. Like John Cena recieved on Mondays main event when announcing where he was from, emphasizing "Massachusetts"<br>  <br>  Wrestlers will get a cheap pop when they either use the name of the city or something it is famous for to get cheers. Heels often follow the same principle but in reverse: insulting the city or bringing up something it is infamous for (such as an underperforming sports team) to get booed. Mick Foley turned getting cheap pops into something of a catchphrase. He would call attention to what he was doing, giving what he described as a "big, cheesy thumbs-up" as he declared that he was thrilled to be "right here in (the local hometown)!".<br>  <br>  There is also the spot pop. This is when the crowd gives a large reaction in anticipation of a trademark move by the wrestler.

Don't worry a reverse dive is probably the hardest dive to learn to do, its really easy to psych yourself out and hard at first to get the feeling of how to do the dive correctly down. It took me the longest to learn a reverse dive, what helped be was doing a lot of jumps looking back but without doing the dive. Also at first i really hipped out my jump to get further from the board and get over the fear hitting,and i really  concentrated on really bringing my knees up into my shoulders to help me to spin backwards better. Have you considered learning a reverse flip first? it can actually be easier learn  because you have a better sense of where you are in the air and when to kick out, if you can throw a back flip you might want to try a reverse flip if you cant get down the dive.
c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	George Howard Brett.  There is no Royals history without him.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	There are two players on the Milwaukee Brewers that stand out, both are Hall-Of-Famers, and both played at the same time for the Brewers:<br>  <br>  Robin Yount - Spent his entire 20-year career in Milwaukee, finishing his career with 3,142 hits. He was a two-time MVP. First ballot Hall-of-Famer.<br>  <br>  Paul Molitor - Spent 15 years with the Brewers. He was also a first ballot Hall-of-Famer, a seven-time All-Star. My all time favorite player.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Well I think that Babe Ruth is the most popular player to ever play for the Yankees. It's Babe Ruth, he is the most popular player to have ever played the game.<br>  <br>  But if you are talking someone who represents the franchise, I would go with Lou Gehrig. His "Luckiest man on the earth" speech is one of the greatest moments in the team's history.

6en8QlaUaa	The amount of grains as it pertains to purchasing ammo is the weight of the projectile.<br>  <br>  1 ounce is 437.5 grains<br>  <br>  Common 30-30 ammo weight conversions would be<br>  125 grain = .286 oz<br>  150 grain = .343 oz<br>  170 grain = .389 oz|`|a893b2d2332387b71e69d418087c9c7eaa	Originally, the 30-30 was loaded w/ black powder and the weight of the powder was 30 gr. Nowadays, all cartridges use "smokeless" powder, which although not entirely smokeless, is more stable than black powder.<br>   The weight of the bullet varies roughly from 140 -175 gr.<br>  "Grain" is an Avoirdupois measurement that is rarely used except in firearms cartridges.|`|qoE9H2WNaa	The term 'grains' is the avoirdupois (English) unit of measure used to weigh both powder charges and projectiles in most ammunition references and data. It comes from Medieval terminology referring to the weight of one grain of wheat.<br>  A powder charge of 10 grains is the equivilent of 10 grains of wheat.<br>  Some European data is given in metric terms, weights of fractions of grams instead of grains.<br>  <br>  A good reloading scale is accurate to .10 grain, or 1/150th of a GRAM or more! ! !|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Ya, that's right.  As a 'purely for the nit-picker':  it's interesting that you picked the 30-30 WCF for your example because--along with others like the .45-70 Govt., & 32-20 just to name a few--the second number in its name is the nominal weight in grains of black powder originally loaded for the cartridge.  So, whenever you go shopping for the '30-30', ya actually ARE specifying a powder charge, albeit an obsolete one.  I said it was nit-picking.<br>  <br>  edit:  alright, Chris, the 2nd # in '30-30' referred to grains of smokeless rather than black powder.  I should have known better than to pick nits.  However, neither of us mentioned that '30-30' was not the cartridge's original name.  Winchester called it the .30 WCF.  It's believed Marlin dubbed it the 30-30 to avoid putting the Winchester name on their rifles.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	One correction to these otherwise correct answers. The .30 Winchester Central Fire(WCF)  aka .30-30 Winchester was NEVER factory loaded with black powder. The .30-30 name was originally a nickname but still referred to the weight of the powder charge as the original load used approximately 30 grains wt. of winchesters proprietary smokeless powder. This could vary a slight amount as they corrected for the burn rate with various production lots of powder. <br>  <br>  Buying ammunition these days the grains weight listed on the box is bullet weight. The only factory loads that I know have the powder charge listed are Hornady's loads for their 6.5mm Creedmoor round. They list powder type and wt to duplicate the factory loads to encourage people to reload(using the corresponding Hornady bullets of course *wink*)|`|oZj6DfpKaa	when purchasing ammo, it is the weight of the projectile.  A 30-30 usually comes in 130 & 150 grain loads.  The 150 is heavier and hits harder and penetrates more and also has more recoil than the 130s (marginally so).  The 130s are lighter, will travel faster, have slightly less drop at longer ranges.<br>  <br>  Each load has it's advantages and disadvantages.  I shoot 130s for whitetail deer.|`|EgGoJ2ztaa	WEIGHT OF PROJECTILE<br>  grains is a weight measurement that can be used to express how much powder is in a cartridge if you are loding your own for example. But if you are talking about off the shelf ammo and the box of 308 's sayse something like;<br>  Remington-308cal. soft point 180gr.(grain) than it is talking aboput how heavy the projectile is.|`|FNMMm7Dnaa	grains refer to how grains of gun powder inside the cartridges.|`|AA11694178	The number printed on the box of ammo is always the weight of the bullet.  The powder is almost always proprietary and the name and amount is a secret.  They often, but not always,  print the expected muzzle velocity of the bullet on the box as well as the weight of the bullet.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	when buying, it is the weight of the projectile, when reloading it means both!

I asked if you liked him.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I'm never in this section but I'll give my two cents anyway.<br>  <br>  Some guys are like that and it is with all sports, not just basketball. I think that with some guys it is a defense mechanism. Sports is supposed to a guy thing. God forbid a girl might know more than they do! Also, I think that with some guys it is skepticism. Girls that like sports and actually know their stuff are in the minority. I think that guys sometimes assume that the girl doesn't really know what she is talking about. Then it is just fun to prove them wrong. As for finding players hot, that is just icing on the cake. I watch sports for the love of the games. It is just an added bonus that some of the players are cuties. Lol.<br>  <br>  Extra: I can't wait for March Madness.

On a compound bow, specially, a string might be in otherwise good condition, but a small nick somewhere can cause it to fail.  Check for abrasion, small nicks and cuts, the obvious fraying, and check the serving for gaps.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine had his bow on a stand, someone was passing by and accidentally kicked his bow off the stand.  That was enough to nick the string.  Good thing he had a back up bow.|`|KLdZ8an6aa	It will start to fray and lose color.

Howard is more athletic than Shaq was, but he doesn't scare other big men like the Diesel...i don't think NE1 will ever intimidate or dominate the way he did...Tyson Chandler is solid, even if it's not highlight material, Bynum of course has potential, just like Derrick Coleman did, i like Joel Pryzbilla because he's a hustle center who doesn't play for stats, just the W and that's five...Pau is like KG or Amare, he can play center, and be good at it for a lil bit, but he's better at the 4 i think, gives him more versatility...oh wait...Yao Ming...i forgot him...he's solid, he's got better range than most centers, he swats, but he needs to stay healthy, not his fault though, the time he puts in is quality.|`|o5bTKDyRaa	Dwight Howard (hands down)<br>  Kevin Garnett (although not a natural C)<br>  Tim Duncan (see above)<br>  Shaq (One of either top 5 or 10 scorers in NBA history)<br>  Yao (being 7'6 does help)<br>  <br>  As an Australian, I am hoping that Andrew Bogut will join this list<br>  in a few years|`|05c7fca39447e79d146ab6130a6b3683aa	Dwight Howard hands down is the best center in the NBA.

a5b9a79555f264da9d5ea0d5bf063582aa	ok I'd like to know what exactly your rollerskating for and what the circumstances are but ill give you this. a good pair of roller skates should run you about $80 and the knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist guards all come in a pack, and those can be anywhere from about $15 to $30 but you want a pretty good helmet and you can pick that up wherever you get the pads and it will be about $25. I suggest dick's sporting goods for all of this. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  -charlie
D8yPGGNNaa	Just Saw the News My Self....<br>  If it's Not a Stunt, It's a Mistake to relase T.O. for three reasons:<br>  1) I'd rather Have T.O. on the Team then have to play against him.<br>  2) He has a lot of talent and a great work ethic, and is more productive than the other 3 Wide Recivers combined & #2 All Time!<br>  3) Salary Cap, would have been better to keep him & work out the Kinks, Now Roy Williams is going to be hounded, he would bring balance if they just worked through it. <br>  4) Can't Blame TO for everything.<br>  Marvin Harrison, also w/o a team, I'd like to see him on a team that Dallas/Indy will not Play during the regular season.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	stop givin the cowboys crap and this was bound to happen anyway,so get over it.

Have y'all notice that only the "wanna be stars that only got fame by being on ESPN" dudes are the only ones saying this. NFL Network guys don't say that. Only TD and Coach Mora. Only the star athletes knows about TO. He is not a bad player. TO is a great WR and he want the bad. If you were a great WR and you wasn't getting the ball you would complain too. TO put ROMO on the MAP. And ROMO ain't that good anyway. ROMO got fame because of TO. Did TO lost the game against Seattle? NO. ROMO FUMBLE THE BALL. Who lost the game against the Giants? ROMO. TO did not lose the games. ROMO lost em. Romo is not Tom Brady or Manning. IF you don't like TO then you some corny ish. TO drop balls. SO EVERYBODY DROPS EM. But he catch more didn't he.

Why not hang on to T.O. one more year.  <br>  <br>  Guess Jerry finally came to the conclusion that everyone else came to long ago....T.O. is a cancer and not worth the trouble.  (although he did get Philly to the SB)<br>  <br>  I think he will beg N.E. to pair him up with Randy so he can finally get a ring.  <br>  <br>  But he would look right in a Raider uniform.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	It was a mistake in that they waited too long to do it.  They'd have had more options of free-agent WRs to replace T.O. with if they'd have ditched him sooner.<br>  <br>  Other than that I think it was a good move for the team.  I'd be shocked if Romo doesn't look better at QB next season while not having T.O. hounding him for the ball every play of every game whether he's open or not.|`|AA11760438	THE RAIDERS..<br>  <br>  <br>  they need a WR T.O. needs a team.. <br>  <br>  Raiders love people like T.O.<br>  <br>  He was born to wear the Black.. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  expect.

T2UZXarLaa	I think the emargency techniques youre talking about are last minute efforts to just do something to get the ball up<br>  <br>  that would make the answer b<br>  <br>  An over head dig is something youre probably not going to use very much unless youre a short DS (libero) on a good team. it involves putting your hands, palms crossed above your forehead with the palms facing the incoming spike. this is then angled to the setter for the counterattack<br>  <br>  sprawl is another term for the pancake in which a player falls to the ground placing their hand on the floor so that the ball hits the players had instead of the floor. the ball can then be recovered by another team mate - really only works well in indoor<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	b is the correct answer.  A pass, a set and a serve are not emergency techniques.  <br>  Skiz has a great answer except that the sprawl is a type of dive.  A pancake is one type of sprawl.  The sprawl can use forearms as well.|`|PJQ1Nm1Oaa	D is actually impossible, because you only serve to start the action.  B and D are only possible if you mean and overhand dig by one person and a pass, and set by someone else.  You can't really use an overhand dig if you sprawl.  Sprawling is kind of like diving, you lunge to the ball instead of diving to get the ball.  I would have to say that that would be the only thing considered an emergency technique out of you options.  <br>  <br>  An overhand dig/pass is just a pass using your hands instead of your forearms.  I have seen libero's  that only pass with their hands, unless they have no choice but to use their forearms.  It's a matter of choice.|`|u2J0ZuR1aa	i reckon b    and overhead dig is actually the person in action is facing away from the net and must get it over so they dig it backwards....over their head|`|9rjDv3o6aa	c).

c17x6L4baa	They are mostly jealous of the over-all long-term quality of the program.  Right now, with OSU on a downturn for the last few years the little back-bitters are having a field day.  All of their frustrations over years of losing to long term strong programs get a release when one of them loses.  Kinda like when USC gets upset, or, Oklahoma loses another bowl game.  Circling as TT beat UT.  Haters with sad lives..  <br>  <br>  Some people try to improve themselves.  Haters just try to make others seem worse.  The bottom of the curve people always hate others success.<br>  <br>  There will always be vultures with pathetic little lives who have nothing better to do than circle around looking to try to attack anything good that shows a weakness.  Part of nature.  Some people like to improve the quality of the world.  Others are pathetic losers, who only enjoy spreading bile.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Who's jealous of them?  They lost their last 3 bowl games, last 2 championship games, and haven't done a thing since Maurice Clarett..... Total joke.|`|ABoo1doVaa	The big ten is down in both football and basketball at the moment, although not as bad in basketball. As for football, things were going great, and the bottom just fell out in 2006. Not really sure why that happened. As for Ohio State being the biggest chokers, I am pretty sure that since they still hold a 500 record in BCS games, that would have to go to Oklahoma.<br>  <br>  As for the comment about big ten running backs, it's pretty much true. I don't know why that is. Every other position does just fine. Kind of ironic since it's known as a running conference. The only really good running back out of the big ten that I could think of in the last decade or so is Eddie George.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	So great?<br>  <br>  Did I miss something the past three years. How many times have they choked under Tressel? The only teams they can beat are teams in the Big Ten. Big deal. When Joe Pa beats you, forget about it.<br>  <br>  Out of all the schools in the FBS, I always hope the worst for the obnoxious and ridiculous fans of OSU and Texas. If you guys would get over yourselves, then maybe you could go on to do other things besides play football.|`|k6u1Kka0aa	ROFLMAO! You cannot be serious!

When par is used to describe some other things perhaps not measuring up to the norm would be a bad thing. Not all things that are above or below par can be said to be good or bad. A students marks that don't measure up and are below par would be considered poor.A purchase below par for a product would be considered a good thing.

hfH8c1LWaa	the smaller the rear tire, the stronger it is because the spokes are closer together. they need to make them smaller and wider because they want to provide more traction, getting a larger surface area on the ground to give it more grip with the dirt, and u need a stronger wheel for that.|`|vRWL3Temaa	just a guess i think its so you can go over stuff easier|`|FI1ZPsnsaa	It allows you to have most of your weight on the back tire giving you more traction.

aca48b893c4dd05b8e69f942b3a82309aa	The average Marine actually doesn't outfit his rifle with very much at all.  Out of all the time I've spent downrange, while every douchebag, non-combat-seeing pogue unit in the Army was getting outfitted with tricked-out M-4's.  Marine infantry guys are still lugging around M-16A2's with iron sights.  Maybe the occasional AN/PVQ-31 ACOG, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  What does the average Army Soldier outfit their rifle with?  That's an entirely different story!  We start out with a Colt M-4A4 with a flat-top "Picatinny" rail system and 4-sided picatinny handguards.  For sighting, we either mount an ACOG, or an M-68A2 "red dot" scope.  The ACOG magnifies 1.5x but doesn't have any battery-operated illumination.  The M-68 has no magnification, but has an illuminated red dot that you can see at night.  A lot of the big-time “operators” with beards and no name tapes use the EOTech holographic sight.  Same basic principle as the M-68, but a little better visibility and choice of sight shape. (circle, dot, red cross, etc.) We also add a flip-up rear aperture sight to be used in case the M-68 stops working.  The front sight is still there, so you can see it in your scope, but it's OK, because you may need it if the scope breaks or stops working.  On the handguard, we mount an AN/PAQ-4 IR laser on the right side (only visible with NVG’s.  We use PVS-14’s.  Some units still have the old PVS-7’s) It's not a laser designator.  Designators are the size of a mini-fridge and emit an 8-digit code that the munition hones in on.  "Lazing" a target is an entirely different thing that Cav Scouts and Air Force TAC-P guys do.  The PAQ-4 laser just shines a light that can only be seen under goggles.  On the left, side we mount a Surefire light.  The Surefire light is for room clearing.  A lot of times when we'd go into someone's house, the light came in handy to blind suspects.  There are a lot of instances where flooding the whole place with light (usually during room clearing) was better than night vision because NVG's don't give you any depth perception and you only have a 40 degree field of view.  On the bottom, we either mount an M-203 40mm grenade launcher (super heavy!), a Harris bipod (also heavy and not very useful.  There's ALWAYS something to brace your rifle against.) or a broom-handle grip.  The Surefire light activation switch gets put on the broom-handle grip with black electrical tape.  Everything is either safety-wired to the rifle or tied on with 500-cord for extra security.  Last, but not least, some guys cover up all the optic lenses, close the dust cover and spray paint it with a light coat of matte brown and tan stripes, but that’s because they’re gay and they do it as a secret sign to pick each other out in crowds.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	They outfit it with what they are issued from the armory.  The optics of choice are usually either an ACOG or an EOTech.  If they will be using it in nighttime encounters, they will have an ACOG and an IR Laser designator (square boxy looking thing that mounts to the side of the front grip) that matches up with their issued night vision.  They will not have lights as this will defeat the night vision.
b2qdwABVaa	You release your shot with only your ring finger and pinky?  That's strange lol.  <br>  Work on proper form before you go crazy and shoot 1000 shots a day:<br>  <br>  Square up to the basket, tuck in the elbow, bend the knees, keep off hand to the side of the ball, and shooting hand under, release with fingers, the last fingers to touch the ball should be the middle and index finger.  Flick the wrist for follow through, and keep the pose, hopefully you can watch it swish in at the same time.|`|ChuhyvEaaa	Whenever I was in a slump in would go stand about two feet away from the basket and just do form shooting. When you do this, use one hand to shoot and put a lot of emphasis on your follow-through (put the hand in the cookie-jar as my old coach would say). Also work on making your shot one continuous motion from the bending on the knees to the extension and follow through.<br>  <br>  Work on swishing these shots since after all, a swish is a perfect shot. Once you master these close-up shots from directly in front of the basket, move it over to the side or take one step back and add in your guide hand. Once you master each little step, keep taking it back and back but always using the same form that you did in your form shooting.<br>  <br>  Slumps happen but I found that this is the best way to get your shot back.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|gELcwzNhaa	it takes around 1500 repititions of an action before your brain can transmit it into a skill- and a heap more 1500's to improve on it! :P <br>  <br>  i learnt that in P.E today ;)<br>  <br>  soo i guess all you can do is practise and practise some more but make sure you are practising the correct techniques because if you'r doing it wrong itll be hard to correct yourself later on..<br>  <br>  best of luck tho :)|`|szV2vew4aa	practice,practice and practice. other than that, just practice.

He did not say worship but he said worship the al mighty god ur god and my god. Google it truth is everywhere.

C7S0tgFxaa	A lot of the times it's real. When the referee goes down to "check" on the wrestler, he's either telling him what move to do next or he hands him a small blade. When that wrestler is down he'll turn away from the camera and cut just above his eyebrow which makes it look like a lot of blood but the wound heals quickly.|`|Xm8crry3aa	It is real. However if you notice they only get cut on the forehead. If you look at many wrestlers they have loads of scar tissue in this area.They are told by promoters when to bleed. The old saying is red brings green. Also depending on how much you trust an opponent they usually cut themselves with a razor blade. The blood capsule is just a myth.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Depends. According to some doco's its blood capsules but most times it's real.|`|rs7fuvPxaa	Both|`|77b5BDf3aa	Both about 25% of the time it's fake and 75% it's real.<br>  <br>  For Example when HBK was fighting Jericho and blood was pouring out from around his eye and the ref wanted to stop the match but Shawn wanted to fight. More and more blood kept on appearing so that was real.<br>  <br>  Same with when Shane hit Orton with the T.V monitor and he was busted open on the forehead that was real.<br>  <br>  But I think it was fake when then Undertaker's Hell's Gate submission  move "ruptured" their throat.<br>  <br>  It could be real but hard to say since people don't bleed anymore from that move.|`|niGAKJT4aa	it could be either.  a trick in wrestling is to cut the fore head (sometimes they will have a little pin somewhere on them) as scalp wounds bleed like crazy, and sometimes they have hidden squibs (blood packs) that they bust open when needed for dramatic effect.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	depends, if its a lot from the mouth, its most likely a blood capsule. but if its from the head or anywhere else, its probably real. u should be able to tell the difference.|`|YTLlMdhDaa	If it's coming from the forehead it's REAL.<br>  <br>  If it's coming from the mouth (and wasn't an accident) it's usually a blood capsule.|`|AA11167208	easier than cake. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.halloween-website.com/fake_blood.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halloween-website.com/fake_bl...</a>|`|q71osfkiaa	That's why we call aspirin a blood thinner.|`|VbWhiBAHaa	Real|`|SogDSfygaa	Its real its called blading|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	I think it's real...

Sometimes it is accidental, like they get hit in the nose or something, but usually they cut themselves with small pieces of a razor.|`|GgWrhISBaa	They do something called juicing<br>  <br>  The opponent "hits" them hard enough to fall down<br>  <br>  When the ref comes over to "see if their ok" he slips the a little razor blade<br>  <br>  And while their down they actually cut their own head! So the blood is real....<br>  <br>  That’s why most of the time they get hit in the head because it’s the easiest place to cut<br>  <br>  Here is a video<br>  <br>  This one explains how they do it (sorry it has some other stuff in there to)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9u8x0Xrj4A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9u8x0Xrj...</a>

24UPDIBTaa	Pretty good to be in the two-deep roster for offense and defense as a sophomore. Congrats!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't think you weigh enough to playing end on either side right now, but maybe your school doesn't have a lot of big guys and the coaches figure you to grow into that size. I prefer players without a lot of weight to play away from the line of scrimmage and generally towards the sidelines. If they add weight later, just re-evaluate their position. Besides, skills learned at one position can be of use at the next one.<br>  <br>  You have some height, and that's a plus. It would be beneficial to know if you catch well and how fast you are, but I'll go with what I know. <br>  <br>  Considering your size and how you might grow in the future, I'd point you to receiver then runningback on offense and safety then cornerback on defense. If you add a bit more weight than what I suppose, I might change my longer term (perhaps college) projection to receiving tight end or linebacker.|`|0Fi9EANKaa	no one here on Yahoo Answers knows which position you can be best at better than yourself.|`|otncH1phaa	How big is your dad? How fast are you?  If you have potential to grow and are already coordinated and fast you have the size of a corner.  If you grow about 3-4 inches and put on about 100 pounds in the next year or two, you may get a scholarship.  Maybe you have alot of heart and are a fiery player at your current size.|`|t1Rut5gKaa	At your weight, I'd stay away from the trenches unless you plan on doubling your weight. At the size you've given, I'd probably say Wide Reciever & Defensive Back. At least the Tight End experience should help with your hands. Make sure you work on squats, lunges, & box drills for leg strength to build up your speed & vertical.|`|yPQp0dv6aa	If you got speed, you could try to be a WR. And you could try to be a LB, get some experience in tackling.

Would TO become a model citizen, or would he tank it like always? I am inclined to think tank it.

Hmmm     as a dolphins fan I wouldn't want him at this point. We're doin alright with the rebuilding would want to sink the boat. He's a good player but he tears up a locker room. He belongs in Oakland with Al Davis but he whats a contender so he should go back to Philly. Thats not gonna happen so he should hook up with Matt Cassel or Jay cutler. They have the cap space for him no sweat. With so many WR's coming out in this years draft I doubt anybody wants to mess with him. I hope parcells isn't brave enough to bring him aboard.

CshFQShGaa	The answer to this is no- a current major league player cannot hold any ownership interest in any major league team, even the one he plays for. When A-Rod opted out of his contract in 2007, one of the possibilities being discussed was having him go to the Cubs, with part of his contract coming in the form of ownership stake in the team. That was quickly dismissed as being against the rules.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	Yes. But not in the current structure of major league and minor league teams.<br>  <br>  There are examples of this, in the barn storming days.|`|cfmbN4pPaa	Maybe back in the day when the leages were being made. Im pretty sure how ever those days are over now. To much conflict of interests. Not to mention the rest of the owners/commish have to approve the sale and so on. If its set up like Basketball for example MJ had to sell his stock in the Wizards to come out of retirement and play for them if i remember right. If it were remotely possible it woul;d of at least been attempted by someone like Arod.

W76VDFKCaa	As a former female athlete, my period has never affected me playing sports, or for any of my teammates.  We can use pads or tampons to play sports, just like we do any other time of the month.  Also, with birth control methods today, some can limit the number of days you bleed or stop it altogether, so I'm sure that some of todays athletes take advantage of this.|`|0fQk2spXaa	First of all, nice boobs (whoever they belong to).<br>  <br>  Second, good question. I also wonder what Olympic Swimmers do if the race falls during that time of the month.<br>  <br>  Third, NBA players must come off the court if they are bleeding.

DMszu9OUaa	Well i've always liked Sachin Tendulkar but seeing him play in person and what he did in the last series in Australia was astounding and i was entertained thouroghly every time he picked up the bat so he is number one<br>  <br>  Ricky Ponting has performed consistently for years in both test and one dayers and held the number one spot for a very long time in test so he is up there<br>  <br>  Jaques Kallis is possibly one of the best all rounders to play the game and is amazing with both bat and ball equally, something incrediibly rare and much saught after<br>  <br>  I think that a team cannot be taken only by absolute super stars and Daniel Vettori is a player who always impresses with his amazing economy, his ability to get wickets at crucial times and his handy batting contribution, a must have in every cricket team<br>  <br>  The last one is a hard fight between Vaas, Pollock and Dravid, both Vaas and Dravid trailed on for quite some time when they should have retired and both were amazing for a long time before that, Dravid probably more so than Vaas, however for a long career finishing just as well as it began i'm going to go for pollock, an amazing bowler whose quality did not drop over many many years up to his retirement|`|DD8yiD8maa	1.

Unfortunately, top level corruption and hypocrisy has dumped this nation into total chaos, and cricket as well as most other things has to suffer.<br>  <br>  Edit: It appears as though I have not understood your question.<br>  <br>  My point is, Pakistan should be banned from hosting international cricket.

uUDHEFrSaa	Are you serious, Lou Thesz is a wrestling Diety. Kurt has nothing on him, he is 'it'!!!<br>  <br>  if there was that match, this is how i would like it 2 be: (a sixty minute time limit match).<br>  <br>  Kurt Starts off the match using heelish maneuvres, and is able to nail in an Olympic Slam early on, but Thesz kicks out on the two. Lou then takes the fight back, and Kurt gets great heat from using a concealed knife/blade to slice open Thesz's forehead, Kurt then dominates from there, very slowly wearing down Thesz, then as Kurt tries to go for a chop block, but Lou lifts his foot up and stomps on Kurts head. then Lou takes over from there managing to hit two original powerbombs, a double wrist lock/Kimura and a Thesz Press for a two and a half count. Then Thesz finds the concealed blade that Kurt used and takes it, slashes Kurt on the chin and applies the STF, making Kurts chin tear open and Kurttaps with all he has left!!!!!|`|zLd81qDNaa	Well, it depends.

FUoKu13Daa	Well first of all no one knows what really happened except for those two peoples in that room in Colorado,<br>  <br>  It like having two sides of a story and then the truth, <br>  <br>  so I am not going to say who did what or who made up what but here are some facts of the story,<br>  <br>  Kobe has high power attorney very expensive attorney who job is to discredit this witness no matter if is moral or not there job is to get their client off and they attack that girl in the media.  I am not saying she is a saint but they brought up a lot of things about this girl,<br>  <br>  Second this girl was getting death threats and threats to her family,<br>  <br>  The point I am trying to make is If this girl was unstable which seems to be the case then I am not suprise she did not continue with this case with all the attacks going her way,<br>  <br>  Second and someone else brought it up,  Kobe basically said after they settled that he was sorry about what happen and that he understood how she might have miscongrued what was going on. That admission is puzzling to me because if a girl in her mind is getting raped then she is having sex against her wishes and then it goes back to rape is what it is rape, <br>  <br>  Now the Flip side is maybe this girl saw a payday when Kobe invited her to his room and she was saying cha ching cha ching,  maybe she got into the star struck phase and when she realize that she was just a piece of meat to him she decided to make him pay,|`|jjzK1pOaaa	so adultery is okay?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	This thing happens to every superstar and famous person?  When was LeBron's rape trial?  When was Wade's rape trial?  When did ANY other athlete have a rape trial.  THEY DIDNT.  Thats because your remarks prove that you, like the haters you're accusing, dont know s**t either.  <br>  <br>  In all honesty none of us really knows what happened, but it really doesn't matter now, does it?  I mean there are so many things that just don't make sense.  I mean, it doesnt make sense that she would not want to testify and that she would drop the charges if it were real.  Most people would think that a rape victim would want to see her attacker punished.  On the other hand, if Kobe was really innocent one would think he wouldn't have publicly apologized, saying he understood now that she didn't see it as consentual.  Also, if he were really innocent would he have settled with her in the civil case?  I mean, I don't care how much money you have, why give the ***** a dime if you're innocent?  You'd be better off fighting it till the end proclaiming your innocence.<br>  <br>  In the end, it doesn't really matter what happened, because we'll never know.  All we do know is that Kobe made a very bad decision to even allow himself to be in a position for this to happen.|`|1gHVlfbNaa	I get what you're saying. People do exaggerate and not only that, distort a lot of facts if a great athlete (or any other famous person) is involved.<br>  <br>  And those who keep bringing Jordan up...Jordan's wife Juanita filed for divorce in 2002 and again in 2006 because of "irreconcilable difference" which includes MJ's gambling addiction and ADULTERY.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Allegations.

I feel less stupid now.|`|lOuv50qraa	so much for a peaceful night...........|`|QApr5C7laa	ryan m, stop gathering the fumes off kobe's jockstrap. you protect your idol everywhere its sickening.<br>  <br>  Kobe went to court on a rape charge. That's enough to sully his reputation to the rest of the world. Read up on how evil rape is, do some research on the current situation in Darfur. Point is, being accused of rape is bad enough for a supposed role model like kobe, and it gives us more ammo to use against your hero.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh, and a parting shot to kb24 diehards:<br>  <br>  he ain't a basketball genius. if anything, his constant jacking up of shots and his position of alpha dog on the fakers makes him look the hero whenever his shots do fall at crunch time. flashy moves? go watch and1.
OWIiJMLqaa	You're right about him not being an ace anymore. I doubt the Giants will get much value from him as their #4 starter. Seems to me he had off-season shoulder surgery or was placed on the DL for an extended period hoping his injury would heal without surgery, I could dig around and find out for sure, but whichever it was,it sure didn't help his pitching.|`|GwawzO5Faa	He was never that great to begin with.

cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	The Patriots- where he will form the Dynamic Duo with Randy Moss.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Peyton Manning wouldn't want to play with T.O.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	The two most reasonable likely places to end up are Tampa Bay simply because they have the most cap room to make that type of move...or Minnesota since they lost out on TJ Hous-ya-mama...however I think the real sleeper that nobody talks about is Kansas City, or maybe the Giants just in case they don't get Plax back...maybe they'll sign him after spring training. But, I think Tampa Bay is the most likely.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I hate the Patriots, but that organization is run like a boot camp, and if anyone could shape him up, it's that team. Look at Randy Moss. He used to be just as miserable as TO, and you haven't heard a peep out of him since he joined New England.<br>  <br>  Plus, then I'd have even more reason to hate the Cheatriots.<br>  <br>  Wherever he goes, I hope it isn't the Packers. That's about the only thing that would make me turn in my stock certificate.|`|VBHOiIBlaa	Heads up, look for the Giants to make an offer ....|`|Gb6Hm4xQaa	I hope he goes to the Colts, just because he's a cancer :)|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	I want him to go home. Let him be pushed out of this league like Bonds was out of baseball. When a team like Dallas elects to take a $9 million hit instead of letting you play, that tells me even Jerry Jones got tired of his act.<br>  <br>  However, someone like T.O. will never be without a team until he decides to call it a career. He might end up with the Raiders since they have no threat at receiver. There is also a possibility that he and Rosenhaus will begin trying to rehab Owens' image by signing him to a one year contract with a team to the minimum. Then he becomes attractive to some other teams. He might try to go back to San Francisco as some kind of nostalgic homecoming. He might look to sign on a team that has a legitimate shot at winning the Super Bowl for less money.<br>  <br>  My gut feeling tells me this, though. He will be cheap. But I think that Dan Snyder is on the phone right now to his pal in Dallas making sure that T.O. is really gone from there so he can sign him.|`|t1Rut5gKaa	My guess would be either the Patriots or Giants cause he wants that Super Bowl ring badly. Belicheck would take T.O. in just to give Brady another weapon & Moss more opportunities for one on one coverage deep. T.O. is a great possession receiver & he could work in that offense. New York will more than likely need a replacement for "Cheddar Bob" Burress & Owens could be that & Coughlin could keep him in check.|`|Loq7etfHaa	if i care about him ill say Bucs because Raheem Morris is 32 year old maybe they understand each other and T.O helps Raheem that first year as a head coach easier .. i think maybe he ends up in Kansas City they get someone to throw besides dwayne bowe and noe theyv got Matt Cassell and could have a really good passing offense|`|gYRfWcleaa	Could you imagine Chad Johnson and Terrell Owens on the same team! That would be an interesting combination. They both are hot heads and would probably be at each others throats! <br>  It could be funny to watch.

He's talented but has a major attitude problem.|`|F0sJR0jbaa	Well the bengals love taking in players like him.  I would say they are front runners.

I could also see the 49ers bringing him back, whether he would go there or not i dont know.|`|rwGTRUj0aa	bengals wont sign him. they just got coles from the jets. he'll probably end up somewhere like buffalo or cleveland or something.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	cin has coles and johnson they dont need owens the only thing he will do is make that team more of a mess then the they are allready.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	Bengals because they enjoy bringing morons and jailbirds to there team.

4ca485ab10aead5ea4089df6e7d8f86aaa	The liver punch: Throw a penetrating hook at the body, just under the right nipple: follow through in and upwards. A fair degree of accuracy is needed. The video in this YouTube clip has acknowledged master of the liver shot Bas Rutten explaining how it's done.<br>  <br>  Floating Ribs: The bottom-most pairs of ribs, the floating ribs are structurally weaker than the rest of the ribcage because they're attatched only to the vertebrae, not the sternum like the rest of the ribs are. A good target for body shots.<br>  <br>  Anybody with some meat on their bones and a good understanding of how to throw a body hook can make a liver punch.<br>  <br>  You can't get used to a liver shot per se, but you can learn how to generally take body shots better- rolling with them, keeping the elbows in, tensing the stomach muscles at the right moment- which will help prevent the force from penetrating to the liver. You can't train your organs to better resist blows, but you can train the muscles around the organs to keep force from getting to the organs in the first place.|`|sJrnFCrgaa	Striking vitals are not something a Martial artist will speak freely of. In my Art Discipline is held in the highest regards and when you are ready to learn you are taught. If you are asking then it is obvious your not ready. sorry for sounding blunt but for some people the art is who we are and we treasure its knowledge and respect the hardship we have endured to gain that knowledge.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	This is not something you have a need to know. If it was your instructor will teach you when you are ready. That is is you have an instructor?|`|AFNgR9jTaa	Just going to hit on the accuracy part because the long answer above isn't quite right on that. It is a 4 inch (approximately) area that the liver is exposed to striking, other organs and muscle cover the live from there, so you have to be very accurate.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	The floating ribs are small ribs that basically are at the bottom of the rib cage and are not attached to the sternum. <br>  <br>  To hit the liver you must strike where the liver is at. Pull out an anatomy book.<br>  <br>  Accuracy is key with any vital target strike.<br>  <br>  You cannot build an immunity to a liver strike. If it is done correctly it will drop anyone but it is very hard to get a good liver strike off when the other person is trained and is fighting back.<br>  <br>  Lastly if you have no martial arts training do not play with striking the liver as it can cause permanent damage.
IFGYXPDbaa	You will never get immune to a liver punch.  It is a KO punch no matter how well-trained you are.<br>  <br>  To hit the liver, use a blend of a left uppercut and left hook -- an 'upperhook' (sometimes called the shovel hook).|`|m4z1lq2Zaa	A punch to the liver area of the body is best accomplished by a left hook.<br>  <br>  A well placed left hook will cause pain, and may result in a knockdown<br>  where the one receiving the blow has no control over the legs.<br>  <br>  Nobody can get used to it, and the best defense against this blow<br>  is your right arm and elbow.|`|H13Ah2glaa	when your in your boxing stance and the other person is also rip a left hook just behind there right elbow|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Floating ribs are those lowest and closest to your spine, the small ribs just above your kidneys/<br>  <br>  Anyone who can hook to the ribs can hit them.<br>  <br>  Nobody who gets hit there will ever "get used to it", and no matter who you are or what you do, nobody can ever be "immune to it".<br>  <br>  Accuracy is always important when landing a punch.<br>  <br>  About six to eight inches above the hip on either side with a hook, your left hook to the body hits your opponents liver, your right hook to the body targets your opponent's spleen, and either one can end a fight.
YDpT2ClBaa	a lot of style will have an open hand or open and close the hand just before impact. <br>  relaxing and tensing the little finger just before impact is basicly the same thing,<br>  the point in either case is to relax your arm to make the pouch faster.<br>  <br>  so basically in the beginning of your punch your little finger is relaxed and just before impact you tense your little finger<br>  <br>  edit , i was typing this early and mix up a few notes|`|ZgIZrKi7aa	It shouldn't make a difference in the force of the punch, but it is safer to tense your whole fist.  If you just tense around your first knuckles and you are off on your punch and hit with the knuckle of your little finger, you would be more likely to damage it (and probably also turn your wrist).  I don't know why you would want to keep part of your fist loose in any case...|`|MJNyjiESaa	tense your finger. If you dont you can damage it and you wont create to much power.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	always tense your hand at the last moment before impact.  keep loose until then for speed and tighten to protect from injury.  there no reason to talk about different fingers....they are all to act the same<br>  <br>  EDIT: did SJ say we were missing the point and then say the same thing we did in jibberish form?|`|GpzvrlHdaa	Forget your "pinky", and roll that fist into a solid mass as it strikes.  A 'limp-fist' will damage you more than the object you struck.  Roll the fist closed, then lock it closed with the thumb.  Now maybe you won't break your hand.  J
NnsizqH2aa	Most arts will teach you to tense the little finger in a closed fist punch, since the little finger is the most vulnerable to injury. You opponent is moving, after all. So your intended strike to his eye could easily  land with your little finger hitting a much harder cheek bone.<br>  <br>  If you look at some Karate books, they will teach you to start the fist with the pinky curling in first. Even Bruce Lee, in "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method" (vol. 2), taught to fold the fingers to a foreknuckle fist, then to complete the normal fist. In "Championship Fighting" by former heavyweight Boxing champ Jack Dempsey, the fist formation was also detailed step by step. All this detail is given to protect the pinky.<br>  <br>  Now, tension actually robs you of power, because it slows down your punch. The speed from most thrust punches comes from the elbow, so if you close your hand and tighten the muscles around the elbow, you just reduced your effective striking velocity and power. Take a moment to clench a fist and feel the tension there close to the elbow, both above and below it. This is why most martial arts styles teach to make the fist at the last moment.<br>  <br>  So, really, you can project more power with an open-hand strike, since the muscles do not bunch up tightly around the elbow during such a strike. In addition, because you are not tightening and loosening constantly, you do not become fatigued as fast. You can last longer in the fight.<br>  <br>  For instance, I was going to this club for a while, where they had a punching bag that measured your punching power. I would watch these big bruisers draw back and throw some of the nastiest wild haymakers, week after week, averaging from low to mid 700 psi in their strikes. On the one day that someone convinced me to get on it, I (the smallest man that threw a punch on this thing that night) slapped the bag with a normal punching motion and an open hand... and got 801 psi.<br>  <br>  Find a way to test these things for yourself. Ringside sells punch-measuring devices that can be strapped onto your heavy bag (or a thai kick pad). You might be able to find one cheaper on Ebay or MSN Auctions.<br>  <br>  As always, do the research. Don't let this place, with it's petty personality contests, become your primary source for information.<br>    .|`|w3NrrCpnaa	If I was you, I would relax, that's what I do. But everyone has there preferences. But as I say, I would try to relax it as much as possible, if you can. Your punches will be fine as long as you relax, and twist into the shot. And remember, twist your hand into the punch.
z7JsVzcnaa	Jumping rope can be excellent cardio, but like running, you have to jump rope for extended time.  To get a true cardio workout, you've got to get your heart rate up for at least 15 minutes, if not 20.  And when it comes to exercise and losing weight, cardio is what's needed (in addition to diet).<br>  <br>  If you really want to drop some pounds, you're going to have to commit to cardio workouts of at least 20 minutes 3-4 times a week.

Ricardinho chegou atrasado na apresenta??o do grupo para o Pan, e isto foi o último motivo do corte.|`|D5MSrWVvaa	Leia jornais.|`|UBlEYzp2aa	Sim, é verdade que Ricardinho foi vetado e o filho do bernardinho foi convocado...<br>  <br>  <br>  Fato: Ricardinho se apresentou com um dia de atraso e por isso foi cortado....<br>  <br>  Conclus?o: Mostra que temos um técnico que além de vencedor, tem uma personalidade e n?o favorece ninguém, ao contrário da nossa sele??o de futebol que tem sim cadeiras cativas...<br>  <br>  Fato: Foi convocado o filho do bernardinho pro lugar do Ricardinho..<br>  <br>  Conclus?o: N?o se trata de favorecer o próprio filho tendo em vista que o filho vai ser reserva, pois um outro atleta que já era integrante do grupo assume a titularidade...<br>  <br>  Galera este técnico sabe o que faz.... Já ganhou tudo que podia com a sele??o... E n?o favorecer é o ato mais correto, se todo mundo se apresentou em um dia, o Ricardinho deveria fazer o mesmo...<br>  <br>  <br>  Detalhe: O Ricardinho era o capit?o da sele??o...

wKnjGSU1aa	I ain't gonna make a big comment, I already have in another question, but just to respond to some people commenting on here, have you not seen what most MLS fans say when a MLS team ties or wins 1 game against an FMF team? I'm sure you haven't if you are saying that. For one game an MLS team wins, some MLS fans go and say the MLS is on the same level as the FMF, come on now. I see these FMF people as giving the MLS people a little taste of what the MLS fans say. And to answer the question, MLS is years and years behind the FMF, we all know that.<br>  <br>  Besides, look at history, look at records, let's not lie, no one is basing something on just one game, like I said, look at the history, just a little fact, 24 CONCACAF Champions Leagues for Mexico while 2 for MLS (and also include the NASL which didn't work out), but some people don't like to take the NASL since it didn't work out, people try to erase that, when it shouldn't, it also counts as part of US Football. I don't think that's basing on one game, that's basing throughout time.|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	wow <br>  fmf is better than the mls <br>  be happy<br>  some accomplishment<br>  i guess now that the ussoccer is better thats all that u guys have over us|`|AdOmY9fpaa	its a proven fact that the FMF is better than the MLS, but the MLS is still getting stronger and i know one day an MLS team will win the CCL....<br>  but yeah, they did get raped lol....|`|efGx6z3vaa	Just some mad fans on here, i don't blame them everyone does it to the league they love most|`|WbUrwR2Haa	^^^^ AHAHAHAHAHAHAH u DENY it???<br>  <br>  LOL there are now NO MLS teams in the CCL!!!<br>  <br>  hahahahaha its all FMF all day!!|`|33YAhRXFaa	fmf is better than mls. it'll admit that. but i dont care because the united states national team owns mexico.|`|nKNiKPn3aa	To all of you who say we are basing this in one game isn't that what you guys do when mls teams win by one or tie.

bpWlmcKiaa	To answer your question about them dying...I believe they're dead.  Most likely of hypothermia or drowning (even though they were wearing life vests).<br>  <br>  To answer your question about my opinion of it is that people make too big a deal about it (as far as people on here, obviously not people who knew them in real life like family and friends).  I know, it seems insensitive...but hear me out.  If they were cut from the team and you never heard about the 2 players again...would you have missed them at all?  Nope.  Alright...if 4 people that you have never met and never heard of went on a boat and died....would you care?  Nope.  Happens everyday and I don't see people posting things about that.  So here's what it comes down to....some football players who you probably had no idea who they were to begin with and were insignificant on the football field went out on a boat and died.  Nothing to make a movie about.  It wasn't like it was Peyton Manning and LaDanian Tomlinson along with some of their old college teammates or something.  Like I said, seems mean...but most people that are talking about it won't even remember their names in 5 years without having to look it up...so why even worry about it?|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I think they are floating still if they are wearing the life jackets like the guy that survived said..but I do think they are dead unfortunately. I also believed they died of hypothermia, but sharks is a odd possibility considering they can not find them still.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Dead of exposure then eaten by big fish, possibly sharks.|`|eFhk1HB8aa	tough to hang on to some thing when your hands are freezing,why dont they make life jackets with clip ons so you can attach yourself to a boat that has over turned because staying with the boat is a must to have any chance,|`|FZRWMc3Baa	According to the survivor, they all took off their life vests, so they are not floating around.  I'd say they all drowned rather soon after taking them off.  Truly tragic.|`|JL1ahDlZaa	Idk I think that they are gone, man thats tragic.....what I dont get though is why they all didnt stay with the boat so they could all be found.|`|0XBVbGRKaa	i suspect foul play|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	I believe that they were drinking and went out too far. When they finally realized that they were out too far and the sea was too choppy for their boat, they tried to leave but the boat flipped over. Schuyler probably got back to the boat first and got on top of it. The rest clung to the sides and waded in the water. Once their bodies started giving out, they lost grip of the boat and floated out to sea. Maybe they drowned or got eaten by sharks. Hard to say.|`|1WNOQXVlaa	I think they probably drowned in the first couple of days.  But, they could have washed ashore somewhere. But they were deep sea fishing, so I think they were far from any land. For their sake, Ill pray that they are alive and will be rescued. Although they called off the search on Tuesday.|`|g6MiGWuJaa	i think maybe they got tired or something and drowned and im so sad about it and there familys as if anyone who has lost someone and hasnt found them.

I wish they were ok .|`|yPQp0dv6aa	Doesn't really matter what really happened, I mean sharks or whales (though these ones dоn't eat meat), the guys are not alive anymore and it really s@cks!!!

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	You need to vary your workout distance.  You should do longer runs at a slower pace to put in miles and burn calories.  This tells your body that it needs to store more energy in the muscles being depleted, increasing your endurance.  You also want to be able to improve your pace, so you need shorter runs at a fast sustained pace.<br>  <br>  You can already do 4 miles?  That's perfect, the exact place to start!  Your longer runs should be 6-8 miles.  The slower ones should be 3 miles at first, then 4 miles when you're in a bit better shape.  On the shorter runs, you want to push yourself, on the longer ones, run a comfortable pace.<br>  <br>  I'm not a huge fan of interval/speed work for hobby runners, but some folks may suggest that to you on here.  If you do decide to include those workouts, don't kill yourself the first couple times, ease into them.  I just don't feel that people running for their own fitness/enjoyment need to include workouts that aren't enjoyable, it kind of defeats the purpose of running as an exercise form.|`|lE5Lr9Jxaa	i used to train in school for sports days and what i found best was running up and down a big hill. running up the hill builds the muscles up in your leg and increases the flexibility in your tendons giving you more spring when running on flat surfaces. running down the hill increases the speed at which you move but also keeps you in control of each step you take. hope this helps.|`|QbK66yNeaa	try ankle weights for the speed. and for the endurance push it, slow or fast but just keep running don't stop. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|Fgw9ASqxaa	Do 30 60s

c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	I wouldn't name a starter right now and I'd truly make them fight it out in training camp.  I personally would lean towards Thigpen because he's better on the run and can make plays with his feet.  I don't think Cassel is quite as mobile and that's going ot be trouble behind the Chiefs o-line.  Also, Thigpen starting would keep Tony G happy and be better for Bowe.  The reason it would be better for Bowe is because Cassel is the more accurate passer and you can't hit Bowe in the hands - he won't make those catches.  You've got to throw it 10 feet over his head and let him make the highlight reel catch - Thigpen knows this and can consistently make those throws.<br>  <br>  All that being said, there is no way Pioli/Haley will allow Thigpen to start over Cassel and, even though they said Cassel has to earn the job, the competition is going to be skewed to make sure he wins.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	Neither, I would start a proven winner|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Cassel.|`|qq1fSV2daa	lol .. matt cassel man .. tyler thigpen isnt that good|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	You have to start Cassel. He is still tied to that $14 million tender he signed with the Patriots. Too expensive to let sit on the bench for a seventh round pick. <br>  <br>  As for Tyler Thigpen, I watched him play in college. He has a pretty big arm and can move around. Given the right set around him, he could lead a team to the playoffs. If Cassel works out in KC, I say they should trade him for a third or fourth round pick.|`|Loq7etfHaa	i would start Matt Cassell because he know how to win .. he started for one of the best franchise in the NFL and he learned from a good coach .. besides everything Jimmy said about the money there is a 99% chances Cassell will start|`|AA10915692	Thigpen stats were almost as good as Cassels and he started 4 less games, and didn't have Moss and Welker to throw to. Cassel doesn't have them to throw to anymore now. So don't expect that anymore.|`|HiuNSScLaa	pretty much what jimmy said except for who being better|`|rvl2f6ERaa	cassell|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Probably test out Cassell but you got to remember, he doesnt have the star power like he did in NE, so i dont expect him to put up the kinda of numbers he did like last year..|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Matt Cassel.  It has nothing to do with who I think is better, because, to be honest, I'm really not sure, I think they're about equal, but you don't trade your 2nd round pick for a guy making $14.5 million and not start the guy.  Its a pure money issue, he will start no matter what.<br>  <br>  Edit: Regardless what everyone says, I really don't think Cassel is much better, if even better at all than Thigpen.  He holds on to the ball too long and only got away with it in NE because of their great o-line, even so he was still sacked an NFL high 47 times.  I honestly think he's not much of an improvement and may even be worse.  Everyone who says he's a winner and is better, ask yourself this.  If Tyler Thigpen started for NE last year, do you think they would have been any worse?

There are many people out there who still study the real TKD which was not all kicks but few and far between. TKD mass produces black belts for money and even in the Kukkiwon in Korea they will promote anyone for the right amount green backs. <br>  <br>  Even Jhoon Rhee's schools are mass producing black belts and he is considered the Father of American Tae Kwon Do. He has spawned some of the instructors who are responsible for the franchising of mcdojangs throughout the US like Stephen Oliver and John Graden. It is not about the art with them anymore nor about honor, integrity or quality. This began in the 1980's and has increasingly became worse. TKD is also responsible for the reasons why schools are so terrible today since they will allow anyone with a black belt to open a school regardless of their abilities to teach correctly. It is also important to note that the inclusion of TKD in the Olympics ruined the art form and made almost all TKD schools change to "Olympic" style sparring which is totally useless in terms of teaching self defense.<br>  <br>  TKD has misused the word Karate. They have changed their curriculum and forms more than any other system I have ever seen. They charge outlandish amounts of money for promotions...especially at black belt level and their own organization is corrupt and greedy. There may be several other organizations than the WTF such as the ITF, ATA, USTA and more but in the end they are responsible for ruining what once was a beautiful martial art.<br>  <br>  Edit - Sifu Frank...you never spell it correctly at all...it is Tae KWON do...not kwan. Also why go by Sifu which is no relation to TKD? I have seen many people ask this before. I find it amazing the number of people that cannot spell their art correctly...especially the black belts. I am not belittling you SF just pointing out that you need to take care of some errors.|`|v1mbL56caa	As a Taekwando instructor I  see lots of negative comments about the style from misinformed and those who have only had negative experience with a McDojo. I can't blame those who have suffered a Mcdojo. I can fault the uniformed or misinformed. <br>  Taekwando is a great art, suitable for self defense and sport. As with every art self defense must be separate from sport. Sport training is not the same as Fighting for your life. It never can be unless you count the ancient Roman games where they fought to the death in many instances..<br>  Refer to Nwohioghguy's answer: this is one of the reasons we have dropped our affiliation. We refuse to alter what works best. We set our standard. Although we are not dogmatic about change we are reluctant to drop or add to the art without thorough prof that it works in realistic situations.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	There are so many answers to this question.<br>  <br>  I started in Tae Kwon Do and it is my base art and I love it even though I no longer practice it. But even I have some qualms with how it is taught for the most part now.<br>  <br>  I think one of the hugest problems people see with it is the hands are always down. I was taught from a young age and even in TKD to always keep my hands up. They wear a lot of pads. Look at the Kyokoshin fighting. They have practically the same rule set yet the Kyokoshin use no pad, at all. This can lead people to think it is a "weaker" art.It is littered with McDojo's. I live in a small town with very little martial arts being taught. There are five TKD dojangs and three of them are bad. This is not a good way to show the public what a great art TKD is. I think the over all practicality of what is seen in the Olympics is quite poor for actual self defense and has lead people to believe that that is what TKD is all about. Which is not the case.<br>  <br>  There is not two reasons TKD has gotten its bad rap but rather a plethora of them that could take pages up on pages to write. It is still a great art and I believe will find favor in the eyes of the public again one day|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Let me set the record straight as far as I'm concerned. I have known some really great martial artists that do Taekwondo. There is nothing wrong with TKD as a style if it is taught correctly. The problem as I see it is not the style. It is the massive problem with TKD being the first art to sell out for $$$ I watched the Koreans come into the U.S.A. during the late 1960's and 1970's. the set up dojang everywhere. They started using contracts for ridiculous fees. They promoted everyone no matter how good or bad they were. Now generation and generations of instant TKD black belts later we have a huge mess that effects all of us. Most of the instructors today are poorly trained. They don't know any better since their instructors were poorly trained too. They can only produce inferior black belts. no one can teach someone things they themselves have not learned. One of the biggest problem organizations today is the ATA. I recently met a truck driver. He knows a Guy that go into areas and sets up ATA schools. He then runs them for a while until the school has enough students to get it going. Then the school is sold off. Many times the new owner is not well trained. They work the high pressure sales tactics that the ATA requires of them. They have 15 belts each with a stripe before black belt. Rapid promotions and mandatory seminars as $60 each (one hour long). If someone is gullible enough and pays the high fees, they will surely be promoted to black belt in about two years.  Now TKD and the ATA are not the only ones doing this crap. Other martial arts styles and organizations are beginning to do the same thing. So no I don't hate TKD. I hate anyone that sells watered down martial arts. It is a con game. Most people don't know the difference between a good martial arts class and a McDojo. They willingly open their wallets and pay these high prices for this crap. If the public knew the difference between good martial arts and bad, they would not buy into this and the McDojo would go out of business. What is even more sad is the many instructors out there that really are good people. They truly believe that they earned their rank and that they are well trained. And why wouldn't they they worked hard for a long time. That in itself would convince most people that they deserve their rank. Add a few certificates from some  so-called master and they are hooked for life.  Really sad.............<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I must agree with nwohioguy.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Jhoon Rhee the so-called Father of American TKD was only ranked a 3rd dan in Korea when he started claiming a 7th dan here.  It was common practice for Koreans to leave Korea holding low black belt ranks, only to get off the plan in the U.S as masters. Today the term McDojo is common. In the 1970's the term "Airplane Promotion" was popular among us old timers. It clearly described the farce perpetrated on the gullible public here.<br>  <br>  I also agree with Sifu Frank. I applaud him for sticking to the real as opposed to following an organization that is out to water down thins just for the sake of making more money.<br>  Bravo Sifu Frank !!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Rawwwr    is right. It is the bad schools that are the root of the problem.|`|g6HCRAP7aa	i've found that people tend to say taekwondo will do no good in an actual fighting situation and that it is useless. i don't think that's the case but that's what people argue. <br>  also, there are many poor schools that are in it for the money but i don't think that's the main reason.<br>  mostly i think it's because if you're ever getting robbed, you wouldn't get the chance to back-roundhouse kick them or something before getting knifed. <br>  (in my opinion though, taekwondo is more about developing yourself mentally than physically but whatever~)|`|MnMkgAscaa	Here is why:<br>  <br>  First I have been training in TKD for well over 11 years... and I have been around. The problem is that there are a lot of bad TKD schools out there. TKD is the most practiced martial art in the world. When millions of people practice it... there are bound to be bad schools (just like with anything else). And those bad schools give TKD a bad name. Many of the ignorant fools who bash TKD don't understand that there are many good traditional schools out there who still train in the old method developed by the true father of TKD, General Choi Hong Hi. It was a hard training method. I would love to take someone who knows nothing about TKD and bases it and give them a private lesson with General Choi and see what they think after that. WTF TKD is not traditional TKD. WTF TKD focuses so heavily on sport that is confuses people who watch the fighting style because it is basically playing tag with your feet (which can be fun to do at times I will admit... because it is still full contact). And that type of fighting style has given TKD a bad rep. However, Just like frank said above me, you have to know the difference between Self Defense and sport. At our school we train equally hands and legs (just like in the old days of TKD). We also train basics of grappling and Krav Maga for self defense purposes. We have specific sparring classes for those who want to train in the sport aspect of TKD aside from the art and self defense side. <br>  <br>  But just wait... with the new popularity and explosion of MMA in the world now... MMA will soon develop a bad name because so many "experts" and gyms will come out of the woodwork to teach "Their style".|`|WlQzHPwPaa	Three main reasons that TKD got so much bad press according to me are:<br>  <br>  - Desire to promote the Martial Arts aggressively, especially at the beginning (It's called Aggressive Marketing) in that perspective it created the "Airplane Promotion". (never heard of that expression but that's accurate, thanks pugpaws2) Even my beloved ITF TKD made that as well at the beginning.<br>  - Lure of money (McDojo)<br>  - Became an Olympic game. At first it shouldn’t be a bad thing look at Judo for instance, nobody will say that it’s bad per see. But at least Judo is using most of the techniques they learn in their Dojo at the opposite to TKD that uses only feet. However, since it became Olympic many people of other styles started to become envious of that fact and in there it’s easy to imagine what happens…<br>  <br>  I’m rather sad that our Martial Art has such a bad name but I realized it was more an American problem than a world wide one. In other countries where you can’t make much money out of being a teacher or school owner it’s not as bad. Actually the vast majority of best people in ITF Taekwon-do students are from those countries. I can’t speak for WTF and won’t waste my time with Americanized TKD spin-off.<br>  <br>  But what people don’t realize is that Karate was a great victim as well. Now it’s better because you get the TKD with spotlights on them and it’s not as popular as TKD but at the time Karate had their huge share of McDojo, especially in the ’70 and ’80.|`|uBrTu7OBaa	The reputation TKD has built upon sport has many people to say it's useless, though it's not for the 'people' to decide. It's the individual. It also depends on who's teaching it.|`|L1SIKavkaa	Okay depends where you train, I have seen many crapy schools.

tzrLDbHWaa	Last year they gave him a 4 year deal with a $12 million signing bonus.  Signing bonuses are applied to the cap evenly throughout the contract, so $3 million a year with the team taking an immediate cap hit for the remainder of the bonus should be be released early.  Since he was released early its a $9 million cap hit.  Had they waited it would have been a $6 million cap hit next season, but they would have been responsible for his salary this season.<br>  <br>  Pretty much, what that means is that they pay $9 million this season for T.O. even though he's not on the team.  So its $9 million less that they can spend on other players.|`|AA11760438	THE RAIDERS..<br>  <br>  <br>  they need a WR T.O. needs a team.. <br>  <br>  Raiders love people like T.O.<br>  <br>  He was born to wear the Black.. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  expect.

Although Betts is the only good play for Washington, the Deadskins should be playing from behind most of the day and will be looking to the rookie Campbell to start airing it out. <br>  <br>  Stay away from any Texan! including Johnson. <br>  <br>  Duece is going to grind out 100+ and possibly take an early TD before he sits and lets the Reggie show roll on. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Teams have all but abandoned the running game against them, which means Favre will drop back to pass quite often. Sure he'll complete a lot of passes, but the more he throws, the more likely he is to throw interceptions (which Minnesota's defense can return for TDs). Look for Minnesota to get a something like 3 to 5 sacks and 2 or 3 INTs with one being returned for a TD. Do it quick though because Minnesota plays in a few minutes.

TBS (70 games): Chip Caray is scheduled to call play-by-play on all 70 games, joined by analyst Joe Simpson on at least 50, Skip Caray on 10 and a guest analyst on up to 10 late-season games. (The guest analysts likely will come from announcers who'll call postseason games on TBS.) Marc Fein again will be studio host, providing updates and highlights from around the majors.<br>  <br>  ? SportSouth (55 games): Newcomer Jon Sciambi, former Florida Marlins broadcaster, is scheduled to call play-by-play on all 55 games, with Simpson as analyst.<br>  <br>  ? FSN South (25 games): Sciambi will call play-by-play, with Simpson as analyst.<br>  <br>  ? Radio (162 games): Van Wieren is scheduled to call all 162 games and will be joined by Skip Caray on 120, with one of the other TV announcers filling in on the rest.<br>  <br>  (Note: The 12 Braves games not scheduled for TBS, SportSouth or FSN South likely will be picked up by ESPN's or Fox's national packages.)|`|046e607f8a681039ba320ed546c8742daa	I would say, most likely that will not change.

9651b17083b30cfcafddfa695d20cf09aa	A hell, according to many religious beliefs, is an afterlife of suffering where the wicked or unrighteous dead are punished. Hells are almost always depicted as underground. In Christianity and Islam, hell is fiery. Hells from other traditions, however, are sometimes cold and gloomy. Some hells are described in graphic and gruesome detail (for example, Hindu Naraka). Religions with a linear divine history often depict hell as endless (for example, see Hell in Christian beliefs). Religions with a cyclic history often depict hell as an intermediary period between incarnations (for example, see Chinese Di Yu). Punishment in hell typically corresponds to sins committed in life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with damned souls suffering for each wrong committed (see for example Plato's myth of Er), and sometimes they are general, with sinners being relegated to one or more chamber of hell or level of suffering (for example, Augustine of Hippo asserting that unbaptized infants suffer less in hell than unbaptized adults). In Islam and Christianity, however, faith and repentance play a larger role than actions in determining a soul's afterlife destinty.<br>  <br>  Hells are often populated with demons, who torment the damned. Many are ruled by a death god, such as Nergal, Satan, the Chinese Yama, or some other dreadful supernatural figure.<br>  In contrast to hells, other general types of afterlives are abodes of the dead and paradises. Abodes of the dead are neutral places for all the dead (for example, see sheol), rather than prisons of punishment for sinners. A paradise is a happy afterlife for some or all the dead (for example, see heaven).<br>  Modern understandings of hell often depict it abstractly, as a state of loss rather than as fiery torture literally under the|`|af8a53d818d9eccc44276375b03f40c0aa	WTF does this have to do with wrestling|`|18806ed30e6e2774579102d9de0ce294aa	What has this got to do with wrestling|`|b986dcf9dda10673aeb9e455c4ea8295aa	WTF?!?!?!?!?|`|d5d73b8de5043f8769863884db7c2947aa	To face against the dead man in a cell is simply a hell<br>  a hell in a cell|`|d74df8708ab5e745bb04019bc61888acaa	And why does hell have to do with wrestling and you cant spell|`|2BHHBgnQaa	more nfo do u want to ask if hell is hot or wat if u really want t noe that then b more specific cuz ya

His wrestling technique helps him against bigger opponents.<br>  <br>  "It's leverage; it's getting under a guy," Martin said. "Just knowing if a guy is on his heels or toes on the line, you're able to feel if he's on his base or not. In wrestling, that's a big aspect of it, because you've got to be able to feel the different motions of a guy."|`|QlcGYKs4aa	probably D1AA because of ur height, if u were 6 ft plus, a lot of D1 coaches would look at u as a NT or C or OG|`|t1Rut5gKaa	Fullback, huh?

xhPKkkELaa	Here we go again! Welcome to surfing. This question has been asked enough times before, but there is really only one true answer.<br>  <br>  First of all, surfing is an ocean sport, that should only be practiced by persons who are confident and competent ocean swimmers, who are able to deal with undertows, rips, and sometimes very BIG waves.<br>  <br>  Lessons are the only sensible way to start surfing, either from a professional instructor, or surfing family or friends who are experienced surfers. There are way too many dangerous people in the water now, who THINK they can surf. Please don't join their ranks.The VERY LAST THING the rest of us experienced surfers want is people to take silly on-line advice, and go down to the beach, grab a surfboard, and go out and get in our way.<br>  <br>  Most people start out best on long boards, but I have seen plenty of surfers start begin with a short board and master it in no time. It just tends to be more difficult. The bottom line is there are NO RULES as to what kind of surfboard you learn on. Certainly a longboard usually is more user friendly.<br>  <br>  Most professional instructors will rent you a board to learn on. Beginners shouldn't even think about buying a board until they master the basics, and decide they really want to keep on surfing.When you are finally ready, you should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.<br>  <br>  And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment. I supect that you are mature enough to read through the BS that lots of people throw at you on line.<br>  <br>  Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.Good luck! <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm</a><br>  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:<br>  <a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkSTwhvv9kI/AAAAAAAAAfg/QMqBFAtXzQ4/s1600-h/chinaboards.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...</a>|`|ZdNfgLucaa	John F: you've been pumping out that same answer for about a year now Ah!<br>  not criticizing, just a political statement, it would be nice if people just looked up the other 10000000000 questions that have been asked before this.|`|fFBCJyneaa	Don't go out and purposely buy a brand board. huge waste of money.<br>  <br>  Never Start on a Short Board.

Soak your legs in ice water up to the knee for one minute then in warm water for one minute, repeat 5-10 times.  To prevent shin splints a good non-impact warm up is important, use a bike or ellipsoidal for 10-15 minutes before running.  Non-impact refers to how hard your feet hit the ground, not how hard you work.  The idea is to increase the blood flow through your legs.

But it doesn't do either side of the Old Firm any harm to get a shock from one of the teams frequently derided by their fans as the 'little teams.' <br>  <br>  Keeps the top of the table a bit more interesting... it'd be even better if one of the chasing pack would actually mount something resembling a challenge; as it stands at the moment you might as well stick Celtic and Rangers in a hat and just draw the winner at the start of the season... it'll save a lot of time since everyone knows it's going to be one of those two winning anyway.<br>  <br>  I'll just be happy if my lot survive this season in the Premier; how much would other fans love to hear their manager stating something a bit less depressing than 'we're aiming for third place?'<br>  Even if it's realistic, do you REALLY want your manager saying what amounts to 'the best we really think we are is third place material?'|`|c75d7684a8af4dc243578c5ed81236b8aa	As refreshing as a cold glass of homemade lemonade on a sunny day in July, after a game of 5 a sides.<br>  Rangers have just been Butchered.

FUoKu13Daa	Just look at last year playoffs,<br>  <br>  When Pierce is on he as good as anyone in the league and I mean anyone.  He outplayed Kobe in the finals and even the sportscaster  Mark Jackson and Jeff Van gundy was saying Kobe was the best player in the planet but Pierce out played him.<br>  <br>  If you look at another  playoff game between the Celtics and the Cavs and game 7 it was an epic battle between Pierce and LBJ they were comparing those two to Dominique Wilkins and Larry Bird battle that they had one time,  But the fact is he did not outplayed Lebron but he was as good as Lebron in that series and game 7 he was the best player in the whole playoff that game.<br>  <br>  So yes When Pierce is on he is as good as Kobe Bryant.<br>  <br>  But he has always been a good player but the Celtics were such a bad team and badly manage that a lot of people did not notice him because he does not jack up 30 shots a night and score 50points every other night.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	When he's good Pierce is maybe better than Bryant,Because he's more phically better<br>  But Kobe's a scorer and better player than Pierce<br>  He can score more often than Pierce and is a better team leader|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Kobe is a clown/joke!..lol|`|rZmiyAqJaa	WOW, some actual intelligent, OBJECTIVE answers from Roland, Kraziballer22, and Eddie...Good Job guys! <br>    And to brian f...what leauge do you watch? ' has a slow step and can't break down a defense" YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!  Pierce usually lives off driving to the basket and breaking down the defense, has been doing it his whole career. One of the top free throw attempts per game guys in the leauge, year after year. I've heard Doug Collins and Hubie Brown both say that Pierce has some of the best footwork in the leauge.  You know more than them? <br>    To anybody that can watch a game and be OBJECTIVE ( which rules out all the la fans who are still sore from getting torched last year, who instantly started to hate Pierce) Pierce has never been a secret. When he has to, he can be the man, and he truley is one of the best players in the leauge. But he no longer always has to.  <br>    I was at the game last night, Pierce was unstoppable. If he was a different kind of player ( cough......kobe....cough) he could've easily scored 50-60. BUT unlike kobe he didn't need to keep going to rack up the stats. He scored 31 in the flow on 12-14 shooting. And made 3 huge shots down the stretch, including the one to put them ahead with 18 seconds left in the game. <br>   The other night kobe went off for 40 something right? He took 38 effn shots to do it!|`|m501HwyWaa	I admit he was pretty good tonight but he's no where near where kobes at|`|A71U6gNtaa	no it will be the same.|`|w7gm67dPaa	in a different way...pierce at the end of the espn highlight, u hear, Boston gets the win...when kobe lights someone up, u hear, kobe lit someone up...oh, n the lakers won, back 2 barry bonds steroid case. pierce is clutch, but he doesn't have to carry his team all the time. Ray Allen is the one u hear most about not producing, because mainly he's a scorer, its not his position to be passing or blocking or crashing boards. KG usually delivers, but if Boston is down or in a funk, Pierce takes it on himself to close it out. When Kobe's hot, its all about him and i honestly think in a game, if both of them got fired up shooting wise, Kobe would torch Pierce on the stat sheet, but Boston would still end up winning, because, more often than not, Kobe's the main threat and only one seriously producing. <br>  <br>  Paul Pierce is consistent, haters can keep calling him a faker and a whiner, but he's consistent. He doesn't have to be the man to take the big shot if Allen or KG's there, or Rondo has a decent night.|`|R51YuJjFaa	paul pierce is like tracy mcgrady, when hes hot hes unstoppable, but i dont think hes a match for kobe, he's too quick<br>  when kobe's not hot, he can get to the basket and get fouls, pierce has a slow step and can't break down a defense|`|QApr5C7laa	oh dude, you're just asking to get flamed by laker fans. Pierce is a great clutch shooter, much smarter and more efficient than kobe.<br>  <br>  kobe lets the moment get into his head. pierce just plays off the pressure.|`|0XBVbGRKaa	lolololololololololahahahahahahahahahaha... are you serious lolololololololololollahahahahahahahahah... wait a minute did you just ask what i thought you asked lolololololololololololololololololololh... paul is a very good player but he is not in the same solar system as kobe|`|AA11711847	Pierce at his best is as good as Kobe on average; however, this is not a very intelligent question.|`|15jIeYV2aa	frankly he could be better than him...he's a great scorer, he has a physique that Kobe does not have...but only when he's hot...because i believe Kobe is a freak of nature...man he can score at will!!|`|4DcvpQXfaa	When Kobe is hot,he's better than hot Pierce|`|cRjlBH3raa	yes he is alwasy good....kobe too was good but he chokes on clutch

4g7KvIAMaa	Firstly Riquelme didn't miss the penalty, Lehman saved it. Lehman was an Arsenal player and therefore influences the outcome of the game.<br>  <br>  Eboue did dive but you can't tell me that was the only bit of gamesmanship in the whole game? It just so happens we scored from that passage of play.<br>  <br>  Barca's equalizer was definitely offside but the linesman didn't see Larsson touch in the build up to the goal so we were unlucky there.<br>  <br>  Only a complete MORON would start comparing how teams did against each other as a guide to who should beat who in each match! Every team plays with different players and styles that makes each match up a different event. Just because Lyon beat Real Madrid does not mean every team that beats Lyon would beat Madrid too!

Arsenal destroyed both Real and Juve with fast attacking football. The villareal penalty was won by a dive and Lehmann made a great save - the best keeper in the champ league that season by a mile...lucky for Barca he wasnt on the pitch<br>  Yeah Eboue dived, which must have been very easy for you to spot having been used to players diving with the likes of Deco and Eto'o in your team. Guilys goal deserved to be cancelled. And why did it take your superstar team so long to break down 10 men.<br>  BUT mostly it amuses me to see you have very conveniently forgot that Barcas first goal was offside and should never have stood in the 1st place|`|WdOAxQmoaa	Arsenal won every single game before the final,against villarreal we had luck,you need luck to win things!<br>  <br>  Arsenal were the better team,actully there was nothing init before lehamnn got sent off. we shut out barca till the 80th minute. we had chances our selfs with 10 men. <br>  <br>  henrick larrson changed the game when he came on,it's called class.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Does it matter?.

TWol6a30aa	340+<br>  35+<br>  130+<br>  <br>  MVP in 2009|`|OWIiJMLqaa	I think he'll play hard and put up impressive numbers, then opt out of the 2nd year of his contract, and test the market. Even though he is slated to make $25M in 2010, he wants more, look for him to try and become the highest paid player in baseball, possibly $30M, he won't get it unless the Yankees are shopping, but he'll still try. I figure he's good for 40 HR and 125 rbi, his BA won't be near .350 though, more likely .310-315. OBP will be up there though, he doesn't have any protection to keep people from walking him the way they did Bonds.|`|cfmbN4pPaa	He's gonna pull the same crap he did in Boston/Cleveland. Unlike those teams i have no sympathy for LA. They pretty much cocked the gun and swallowed the barrel. Over all this year he'll probably have to walk the walk ...back up his month with some numbers. second year he'll put the screws to them at some point just like he did Boston. Its hard to imagine any team so desperate to sign a team cancer like manny no matter how good his numbers are.|`|628c0a7848ead945064eefd161db35aaaa	Manny will ask to be traded 9 games in.... why give this guy 20+ million he is NOT worth it....  HAS ANYONE ever bought a Manny Jersey .( he was # 144 in MLB 'on the Sox 07'.. in jersey sales)     and   he was 5 th on the Dogers last yr ..the freakin dodger he was 5th     hes like TOwen a great player and a HUGE LOSER..A-HOLE  he will bat .279 22 hrs for the METS ..after his trade|`|FZRWMc3Baa	With the chance to opt out after this year, it's like a walk year, so he'll probably have a monster year and try next time to get the cash he thought he deserved this time.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Is the guy ever happy? Manny could come close to those numbers by the ALL star break. If he would just shut up and play.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Even an unhappy Manny is good for much higher numbers than these. I would expect to see .310-35-115.|`|5FypDafWaa	more than that|`|iPWKzzQtaa	I wouldn't think so. I will admit that Manny might not prepare properly for the season and might get a slow start.<br>  <br>  Firstly, he's gonna get booed...if he starts sulking, anything could happen. If his behaviour did get out of control, they could suspend him.<br>  <br>  If not suspended or injured..that's another possiblity...30-35 HR's with 120 RBI's...hitting near .300.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	he will perform better than those numbers. How about 38 Home runs, 115 RBIs, and a BA of .315.|`|VwccuEFHaa	He may do bad, but certainly not on purpose.  His contract is not for two years, it is for one year with an option for the second.  Meaning, if he does outstanding this year he has the option to go for a bigger contract elsewhere.  Essentially, his next contract is being based off his performance this year.  If he doesnt do well enough, he'll take the 20 million and go with the dodgers.|`|AA11720887	Manny is not a .350 hitter. He is past his prime but he will pass those figures that you posted. He will hit in the low .300's and will have over 30 homers. Happy or not, Manny wants the big contract next year and he will deliver. Also not 80 RBI's, more like 110. The last part of last season was too much to expect from anyone. Take him for what he is, a great player past his prime but still one of the best in the game.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Sure. But then he'll pick it up come May, and have an even better month.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	he'll do better

r5AMG8g7aa	I have heard the name mentioned before. At the time I did a search for information on it. Nothing came up. Jutsu links like now, of people claiming to be recognized by them. Likely another pay and get you Soke title group. <br>  <br>  Note: in the 1960's there were known to be only three Americans to legitimately have inherited an existing oriental martial art. These three were Andrew P. Tamper (500 year old kung-fu system), Don Angier (Japanese Samurai arts??), Albert C. Church (Inherited a kempo system that came from China to Japan before coming to the U.S.A.)<br>  <br>  New martial arts can only be recognized traditionally (Japanese arts) by one method. The new art must be recognized by the Soke (Head of a style) of a legitimate existing martial art. The new founder is then considered what the Japanese call "Shodai" or "Shodai-Soke". The new Shodai can't recognize anyone else as a Shodai. Even a board of Shodai can't recognize new founders as Shodai.  Only a Soke can do that. If a Shodai passes away and his successor is able to keep the style together, he is no longer a Shodai, but becomes a Full Soke. He then has the power to recognize someone as a Shodai.<br>  NOTE: A Shodai has all the powers of a Soke except that he can't recognize other martial arts as being new styles. He does have the power to promote anyone within his style to what ever rank he wishes. NOTE: Many wrongly assume that a Shodai, or Soke is always 10th dan. That is simply not true. Shogo Kuniba was a good example. He inherited the style from his father. At the time he was a 5th dan/ Godan. He was later raised in rank after some years. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the long answer. i feel it is necessary to explain how things are done correctly since there are a large number of organizations that have trashed the correct method of recognizing new styles.  As always it boils down to either Money or Ego.|`|PvOHHE76aa	never hard you either. your 30 years of training can't compared to my fighting style of wall hacking|`|Yslq4OYhaa	No I have never head of it.|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	never heard of them.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	from what little i know of chinese,  it sees to me someone has mixed chinese and japanese title<br>  sijo is a chinese title the rest is japanese<br>  i have never heard of them either<br>  <br>  creating an organization to recognize your own style seems like a great way to fool some people. i would not put the part past anyone<br>  <br>  edit:> oh cool my person pet troll is back an gave me 4 thumbs down. what a good little thing it is aww. so loyal
Uyz6iZwKaa	Dont think it would work - keep it as it is and raise the salary cap in a year after the financial crisis is over|`|f9hiPMDxaa	As has already been said, no it wouldn't work. There is not the money to have P & R. Second division teams don't have the money to compete for the big names. The grounds would not be suitable.<br>  <br>  P & R did not work previously when Cronulla and Penrith came into first division. They were the most suitable clubs from second division not the top two.|`|1ykzSRtKaa	Never going to happen.|`|mber3JoAaa	Keep that rubbish out of the NRL. Promotion and relegation systems never work well, it never worked for the Super League and it would just be a blight on the game.|`|uKoAMJQvaa	don't think this is a good idea. Not enough top talent to make up more teams. Noe team towns would be stronger because they would have more money/supporters. players would only want to play in the top division.|`|CZvrFqZ1aa	I know you're saying hypothetically here but even so, I don't think a P & R system would work well.|`|hYjuAEzraa	Promotion and relegation can not succeed in the NRL or in any other Australian sporting competition for one simple reason. MONEY.<br>  <br>  There isn't enough money to support a two tier competition in Australia of the type you are asking about. The threat of relegation to a lesser level tier of Competition from year to year would drive potential sponsorship in an already competitive market away from fear that brand recognition would be limited in a lower level.<br>  <br>  The NRL would end up like the English Premier League with certain clubs through financial advantage appearing year after year in the top tier and dominating for decade after decade while clubs with less financial backing would yo-yo between First Division and Second Division.<br>  <br>  The current system of a single elite division supported by state based competitions is far more sensible and financially responsible in the Australian sporting landscape.|`|yzKrwvxSaa	first of all, it wouldnt work. there arent enough teams to make a competition. and even if there were more teams made, no one would come and see their games. there are only 2 or 3 clubs if that that can get the stands at least 75% filled.<br>  <br>  and teams like melbourne and manly would be getting lots of money from sponsorship because they are the teams that everyone expects to be in the top 4 whereas teams like penrith and souths wouldnt get sponsorship from any big names because they would more than likely be in the second division most of the time so the teams would get further and further apart and eventually, the teams that are in the second division constantly, would end up busting and being kicked out of the comp because they have no money|`|yAshtyKwaa	+1 scouzer, wouldn't stand a chance of working.

e5LUghiAaa	Makes you wonder why they invested so much in Downie only get rid of him then get rid of another young kid (Scottie) to get a Downie like player back and acquire a D man that's needed badly only to send him to the Phantoms....Has Homey been talking with Joe Banner?<br>  <br>  @ Lubers<br>  what i mean is to be taken as a 1st rd pick and all the hype that was made by the front office about him being part of the <br>  future of the franchise and then all the problems after his suspension (the AHL declaring him ineligible) yet they made no moves at that time to get rid of him<br>  Bottom line is they took a chance on a kid that was not ready for the NHL let alone take a much needed roster spot|`|93e1ff606f85ccabe51449c8266f3ce2aa	Upshall kept firing from the outside and was afraid to get in front of the net. You could tell his heart wasn't in it and we lost control of the puck too much due to bad shot decisions. <br>  <br>  We're coming up on some very physical teams. We have a lot of property to protect and Carter, Richards and many others should be able to concentrate on scoring goals.<br>  <br>  We needed an enforcer who can actually fight. I would love to see Brashear come home but I'll take Carcillo.|`|eTHEgWq0aa	Carcillo, although he is a fighter (and may i say the best in the league), has a lot of talent and patients with the puck. He knows what he's doing and youre LUCKY to have him. <br>  <br>  He had such a fan base here in Arizona that we'rehoping for his luck with the Flyers. <br>  Just watch, he'll be the star of your team soon like he was ours. <br>  <br>  I'd have to say that this was the most depressing trade i saw made.<br>  They could have taken anyone else on our team, and i would be happier.|`|OmKtUijpaa	Carcillo is just a tool. I don't know why anyone would want to pick him up. The only thing he's good for is starting trouble.|`|tW8fh4IGaa	Sounds just as bad as the Wild acquiring Chris Simon at the deadline two years ago. A pointless and stupid move in deed.|`|AA12089021	This is not a bad move at all Bill. On the contrary, I think it may be a pretty darned good one in the long run.  <br>  <br>  Numbers:<br>  Carcillo (3g, 10a, 174pim, -14) $.9M, RFA 2010<br>  Upshall (7g, 14a, 63pim, +5) $1.2M, RFA 2009<br>  <br>  The Flyers game earlier this week was the first I remember where they had NO players on the IR (Not counting Hatcher).  They are getting healthy fast.  Combine that with the improved play of the kids like Giroux and Powe and something had to give on the roster.  Looking at the other moves they had made leading up to this, Upshall looked to be the odd man out when everyone was healthy<br>  <br>  Carcillo is not an upgrade when compared to Upshall per say, but he is an upgrade compared to Riley Cote.  In addition, they cleared up about $300K in cap space.  I would look for his offensive production to rise slightly as a Flyer because they are a better offensive team.  They have a solid locker room who should be able to not only keep him in check but help the kid mature a bit.<br>  <br>  @Shock and Awe: What exactly did they invest in Steve Downey?<br>  <br>  @Shock and Awe: I am not sure I am following your complaint on this one.  There have been other first round picks that needed to spend time in the minors.  The only reason the AHL thing became an issue was because of the salary cap and the fact that his suspension came from a pre-season NHL game.  Since it was an NHL suspension, he was a cap hit for each game and the Flyers had to bounce him on and off of the active roster because of it.  Had that not been the case, he would have been assigned to the Phantoms.  No-one was going to trade for him while he was suspended, they would have assumed the cap hit for a player who was not eligible to play for them.  They gave the kid a chance and they either weren't happy with him or they moved him to fill a need.  I just do not see what your gripe with the Homgren was on that move.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	^^If Holmer let Gagne walk to the Avalanche then we'd wonder if he got advice from Banner..<br>  <br>  Carcillo was a fan favorite in Phoenix,can't say the same for Downie,he has skills and yes he can drop the gloves...think it's a good fit.Plus as he stated yesterday "He loved the Flyers growing up and couldn't imagine putting the sweater on,a dream come true".I thought giving up a second rounder as well was a bit much but I was sick of seeing the Flyers having to drop Giroux because of Salary Cap issues.Now this freed that up.Giroux will be a star you watch...<br>  <br>  McLaren is an emergency player,in case of injury to any on the blue line.|`|UoUaO52taa	They needed the cap room but hey you'll love this guy. Hits everything, fights anone and can score some.  I wish Buffalo coulda picked him up|`|AA12359047	Carcillo, although undisciplined, has a lot of skill. When he's not acting like an idiot he's shooting the puck, winning battles in the corners, and playing a physical game. Believe me I hated this guy in junior but appreciated his style. He helped make the 2005 OHL Eastern Conference Semi-Final series between the Majors and the Ice Dogs the BEST series I've ever witnessed. Every team needs a pest.<br>  <br>  And bad transactions? I'd say every trade the Leafs have made for the past 4 years. Especially this season.|`|IZ4GcYgiaa	To add to what everyone else is saying :<br>  <br>  What didn't help Carcillo this season was Brian McGRATTon missing most of the season while in the NHL's Substance Abuse Program.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	I guess they felt they weren't shorthanded enough this year.|`|AA12172407	I said this a long while back, around the time of Randy Jones hitting Bergeron and a few other incidents involving other Flyers.<br>  <br>  I was convinced by a few that I was overreacting. Now I may have a point? I do like Carcillo because he is gritty, but yes I am have seen him out there just to goon it up too...actually most times he is out on the ice a fight seems to be the result.<br>  <br>  As for my teams, Detroit stayed put and I am OK with that.<br>  Boston picked up Montador, a good stay at home D man. CHECK.<br>  But Mark Recchi??  This I don't like. Bringing in a 40+ year old brings veteran leadership, but the B's team aren't needing that (see Chara, Wideman, Hnidy, Savard...) Plus, I HATE THE IDEA OF RENTAL PLAYERS, and this seems to be the case.

gdqgVQdKaa	I grew up in Bremerton, Wa. So very close to Seattle. I was 12 when they had the magical 1995 season. Ever seen the MY OH MY video?<br>  I think it was around September 13rd oif that year where Tino hit the walk off homerun after Edgar had got on first. The only notable game ive ever went to. <br>  ENough about that. When i was fifteen i moved to where i currently am and now am close to the Rockies. The M's were never my favorite team, but they hold a big piece of my heart. Its safe to say if they played my team in the ALCS, i wouldnt know who to root for.<br>  The M's have been rebuilding since the record breaking season of 116 wins. After watching thier spring training game against ustralia tonight, i was reminded of how great thier farm system has always been. They tend to do well when they call people up. The trouble is that the past few years he wahas called up the wrong guys or tried free agency. Last year they were oredicted to win the west. What in the world happened? With Griffey around, regardless of what all the haters say, they will do better. They will have more people to play in front of at Safeco. (Yes ive been to three games there since i moved) .<br>  All the Griffey haters have no idea what its like to have him back. They didnt grow up in Seattle. We know hes not dominant anymore...but we cannot express our excitement. He has already greatly increased attendance. And if anyone thinks attendance does not affect your players moral or record? Think again.<br>  The M's got Gutierrez from my favorite team. I was sad to part with him, but im glad he went there. Just you watch and see how big an impact he makes.<br>  The pitching should be slighly better than last year.<br>  Sweeney will prove valuable.<br>  Beltre will have a better year than the past two, returning to form.<br>  Id say Mariners fans (and myself) should have every reason to be excited to see the improvements that will be made this year. :)<br>  Best of luck to my hometown M's. Ill be watching. <br>  <br>  Hope this is your best answer. Seems im the only one with any apppreciation for griffey, or knowledge of the mariners.|`|nTKNGajYaa	my best guess is that they will be lucky to win 70 games.  there's just not much talent there besides Ichiro, Felix Hernandez, and Erik Bedard.  Griffey could have a solid season of maybe 20 HRs, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.  But there's just not enough offensive punch or pitching for Seattle to be a serious contender.  They have too many players below league standards at too many positions.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	Spring Training means nothing so don't let it get you too excited.  I don't think they can compete in the near future.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	There is no correlation between spring training and the regular season.  Seattle is several players short of competing and I look for them to come up far short once again.|`|nfdlPfdQaa	I think DH'ing Griffey will certainly prolong his career and possibly fend off the injuries. He's a naturally-gifted hitter. Even in the last few seasons, his numbers have been decent. As others have mentioned, if the youngsters come around, especially with pitching, anything is possible. As long as you have Ichiro in the lineup each game, anything is possible. He is a wonder to watch with very few players with his speed, arm, and bat. As the pitching goes, so goes the Mariners.|`|cfmbN4pPaa	Sweeney probly wont see lot of play time unless Griffey plays out in the field. I dont know why they would do that with him being so prone to injuries. Anyway no i dont see a lot of signs for a turn around. on the flip side when the Sept rolls around they might be able to trade Sweeney/Griffey/Bedard to a contender for some decent prospects. If they make the right deals and take notes on Billy Bean they could make a solid turn around in that division in the next 2-3 yrs. Its looking like it will be close between A's and Angles this year....least it wont be the AL version of the NL West this year. Think the A's might pull it off this year and win that division...good mix of the young/veterans( that arent to old this time)...Either way they shouldnt waste their time flying out to Boston....Go Sox!|`|5pujYL3Yaa	couldn't do much worse huh?  griffey?

The night after Shawn Michaeals left Triple H and Chyna rebuilt DX with X-Pac and the New Ahe Outlaws.|`|eYs8DpbBaa	When first formed no. Later Chyna was added. When HBK was out with an injury DX became HHH, New Age Outlaws, and we all try and forget Xpac. Eventually HHH turned on DX and went out on his own. When HBK came back they do DX reunions every once in a while of HBK and HHH. Chyna is prob back in rehab, New Age Outlaws are in TNA, and X Pac is probably drunk in a gutter somewhere.|`|AA11528760	You got your answer from the other users.

52luRGoVaa	yeah i like him, for me, the goldberg era on the wwe was the final few months that the wwe was actually good, evolution vs goldberg, after that, cena suddenly turned into a main event guy, ergo it started to suck.|`|kCDDRFQCaa	No. He was at best a flash in the pan. WCW used him to get ratings. Remember that wrestling matches are fixed and have scripted outcomes. They booked him in over 100 matches with low level midcarders to have his streak of undefeated matches. WWE brought him in and didn't use him quite that way, but they still used him as a mid level heavyweight contender. He will never be seen in the same light as Hogan, Flair, HHH, Sting, Bret Hart, or Angle. there are many more names I could have used, but Goldberg will never be seen as a top dog. He does have a good reality show on people driving through the mid west.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	No. All Goldberg was good at doing was squashing opponents in squash matches. When he had to work long matches he was exposed as not being that good. He had a decent gimmick that I personally liked but I would never call him the best ever.|`|w2nMrQzwaa	to that guy who is saying there cant be a best in wrestling, of course there can. Yes is is all scripted, but the moves are real, and the best WRESTLERS will get to the top.|`|vvdc5EnTaa	no because he was a spoiled brat from the beginning. He took everything he had for granted.|`|xFPFYvSlaa	yes he had that potential to fight as he was the  best there ever|`|q70BFoE5aa	no he was/ is has been|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Not even close the man was all power and nothing else, he was a serial botcher. Goldberg was nothing more than WCW hype because they knew the glass celling had caused them a lot of problems so they booked an unstoppable monster with a streak that jumped up randomly. I can't remember a good Goldberg match|`|gfxXikenaa	Bret Hart ===the best there ever was !<br>  <br>  EDGE ===the best there IS now|`|EmUqxoN2aa	He was just a brawler, flexible martial artist, but that's it, no technical skills like Bret, Benoit, no high flying skills like Owen and Jeff Hardy, no charisma/mic skills like Austin, Triple H... Goldberg sucks, and wrestling is not his life, but more a good chance to make money. If the offer isn't high enough he couldn't care less about the wrestling entertainment. Goldberg was a good wrestler amongst the brawlers, he had a huge push, they actually won 173 matches, that's a good thing. But now he is just another guy from the past, he's not imortal as the likes I mentioned above.|`|RskPXtibaa	i disagree totally that WWE didnt use goldberg well<br>  <br>  in fact goldberg one year wwe run was the best of any superstar <br>  he had an awsome matches with thr rock, jericho, HBK, kane and evolution<br>  but the end was so crap with lesner<br>  but he was one of the most entertaining superstar in ring than anyone<br>  the main reason he left wwe was he was not used to attract the kids<br>  <br>  now that wwe id PG he can return because he always said that he wanted kids fans|`|F5JXQUEAaa	Not the best there ever was. . . that title goes to HBK.<br>  But Goldberg was fun to watch, even with limited wrestling skills. He's still one of my favourites, but not the best there ever was.|`|sQpoIxf7aa	when goldberg was with wwe is was the best because he only lost when his opponents cheated plus winning the world title and giving raw ratings

m4z1lq2Zaa	There is no right answer when it comes to landing the first five<br>  blows.<br>  <br>  The important first step is to have the proper balance, stance and footwork.<br>  <br>  In general, you will attempt to measure your opponent behind the safety of a left jab before using hooks and crosses.  If possible, the first<br>  five scoring blows will be left jabs.  But, depending on the<br>  actions of your opponent and both of your skills anything is possible.<br>  <br>  But the theoretical answer to the question is the first five strikes should be landing on the proper target area.|`|iAhz88tEaa	kicking them to the knee to break it is a ***** move and you only do it to save your life. if its a man to man fight, learn to ******* fight, and win, the honorable way
NnsizqH2aa	This is why so many different combos are taught in every martial art, including Boxing. Your response is dictated partly by the situation and the opponent. If your drunken brother-in-law attacks you and knew it was coming, you will respond with a different level of force than you would some guy  trying to car-jack you outside of a store.<br>  <br>  In the streets, I'm quick to toss elbows and am very aggressive. Against people I know, I tend to be more defensive and use open-hand strikes. The only thing that is common between those situations is my use of the guard and spear actions. Now, once I get hurt, all bets are off and it's all the same for everybody.<br>  <br>  When possible, one of my first strikes is to the shin or gonads. Those generally bring my opponent's head down, allowing me to get a reverse head-lock and then to fall back into a DTT. Nothing like a full body-weight fall on your head to end a fight pretty fast. (Watch out! I've been puked on after doing this move.)<br>  <br>  Guy makes the mistake of getting up close and chest to chest, like he's trying to impress you with his greater height or size, by all means hit the groin first. He put them there so close to your hand, so make use of it to max advantage.<br>  <br>  If he's further out, like he's watching your hands, bring your hands up in a defensive-looking guard, like you don't really want to fight... then kick him in the shin. This can be followed with a good strong round kick or knee to the opposite thigh, which can put him on his butt right there. A nice elbow to the back of his skull as he bends over is a good follow-up.<br>  <br>  Now, there are many arts that teach 3-5 punch flows, like Praying Mantis and Chuka Shaolin and Dragon Style and Kenpo. They teach this "overkill" concept because not everyone responds the same to being hit. People high on drugs often won't even feel strikes that we normally think of as being finishing moves. Heck, as a cop, I've seen a guy keep running after being shot 39 times by the officers that had surrounded the store he robbed, so it always amazes me when martial artists are arrogant enough to think they can take someone out with only ONE little weak punch. (A visit to any ER, where nurses will gladly tell you about guys that have lived through shooting themselves in the face with shot-guns, will change your mind.)<br>  <br>  There is no single set sombo for all opponents. But there are some nice videos out there that will show you some good options and train you for flowing between them. Michael Olajide's "Aerobox" video builds up from 3 punch combos to full-speed 24-punch combos, making you sweat while you train your nervous system. In the course of that, he teaches you eight different opening combos that can be applied to a large variety of situations. (Change some of those strikes to forearms and elbows, and you're working on making it work for the streets.)<br>  <br>  Each strike should build upon the other, since your opponent will respond (if he's not high on drugs or seriously drunk). So, an eye jab can set an opponent up for a groin slap, which can precede an uppercut- hook. Finish with a solid strike to the solar plexus to make him fold and shoot a final hit to the kidneys before beating feet for the door.<br>  <br>  Lots of ways to do it, bub. I've ended fights in bars with drunks just by faking high and then kicking them in the bladder. Side-step the piss and walk straight on out.<br>  .|`|Y26eOD9Caa	I'm not staying around to hit someone that many times.  If i'm lucky enough to get the first strike in, its probably going to be something instinctive, say a straight punch to the face, then close in with a forearm smash to the side of the neck, and a short knee to the groin.  Then i'm out of there, whether he's on the ground or not.  Three moves at minimum is my plan. Anything else, and your not in a self defense situation; you're in a street fight.|`|AA10659039	Hit 1: Knee Cap to disable opponents leg, removing mobility<br>  Hit 2: Jaw to knock sense into opponent<br>  Hit 3: Jaw to knock more sense into opponent<br>  Hit 4: Jaw to knock even more sense into opponent<br>  Hit 5: Torso, finisher kick|`|v1mbL56caa	The best place to strike is the target of opportunity. If you are still slugging out a street fight after 5 blows that connect you are in serious trouble. Call for back up.. lol|`|KbxPl1oYaa	For you???

Don't get into a fight|`|ZEAqJM4iaa	If you've landed five strikes and they're still going you are in big trouble so the "first five strikes" should also be the last five.|`|ph78tZVcaa	well you should be avoiding fights at all costs... if things are going out of hand lock their joints up and put them on the ground.|`|Ry77jN0qaa	Horrible question.|`|mWvz6UXGaa	the face i would hit theam in the chin and temple and work that|`|AA10744471	Your first 5 strikes must land solidly to knockout or immobilize your opponent, otherwise you are in big, big trouble. You must be the first to land those 5 strikes in any part of the body to avoid a knockout.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	That is simply 4 strikes too many in my book.<br>  J|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	The only matter in determining where to strike is based on the situation. No single fight is the same nor are the combatants. There is no determination of strikes to certain areas except to be prepared to keep a calm mind, focused on the destruction of the attacker and to leave once you have defended yourself.<br>  <br>  Now, that being said all the Krav Maga guys will tell you about hitting the sides of the neck or some urban legend about striking the nose to push it through the brain...or worse strike the sternum to send bone fragments into the heart. I even hear this from TKD, Karate and other people out there who do not realize that if a person wants to fight you they will just walk up and hit you with no warning. If they are staring you down or talking smack but have not attacked just back up to a safe distance, keep your eye on them and walk the BLEEP away.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	There are many places to strike. The problem is if you go into a fight with a plan, you will most likely fail. You must be well trained, and you take what opportunities that either come your way or that you can create. Of course Luck is always helpful.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	strike 1- i hit them<br>  strike 2- they hit the ground<br>  pickup phone strike 3,4,5--  9-1-1<br>  <br>  <br>  never plan it, you should rely on reflexes more. there are way to many variables.<br>  <br>  edit cool i see my pet troll found me and is giving me thumbs down again. such a loyal little fella with nothing better to do|`|g7xaB57Xaa	If its life or death, and you mean in a row real fast, jugular X5.  If its competition, nose, nose, left or right side button, button again, and again and by the fifth you can hopefully knock him out.

It also claims just over 50% winner and in smaller print it is to ￡200 stakes and three horses a day. I work this out roughly as 1040 bets at ￡200 total outlay ￡20,800 of which approx half is lost so his ￡29k must mean that his other 520 winners returned ￡39k so  on my calculator ￡39k divided by 520 winners = ￡75 per race/winner Soooo..the returns on each of his winners is ￡75 for a stake of ￡200 which I guess means the average winning price is around 4-6.<br>  My brain hurst...going for a whiskey!!|`|dC4qmz8aaa	Chester would be a good racecourse to start with, nice round galloping course..horses who like to front run are often very hard to pass and low drawn horses have a distinct advantage here.  <br>  Did a little research on this myself and found a 33% strikerate of topweight horses being placed 1st, 2nd or 3rd..<br>  ...look forward to some results from other courses..very time consuming hobby but could be profitable..who knows.

bmKhbWiTaa	Because of the hectic pace of rearmament during the early thirties, and the need to focus resources on the development of tanks, aircraft and other military hardware, it was decided by the German High Command that there was no need to replace the Gew 98 and that a shortened version would serve as the basic infantry weapon. Because of commercial production, Mauser was quickly able to supply prototype that met the armies specifications. Thus in 1935 the Kar98k was accepted as the standard infantry weapon. The designation translates to: short carbine 1898 model.<br>  <br>  The Kar98k served the Wehrmacht well, and under went several changes during the 10 year period that it was produced. These changes were made in an attempt to reduce production costs and to increase actual production During the 10 years that they were in service, it is estimated that a total of 14 million rifles were produced.<br>  <br>  Despite its excellent track record, it was quickly recognised that the bolt action rifle was becoming out dated, and work was done on the development of a semi auto rifle to replace the Mauser.<br>  This lead to the introduction of the Gew 41(m), Gew 41(w), the Gew 43 and ultimately the MP44 series. However because production of these weapons was never enough to meet demands, the Kar98k continued to be produced throughout the war.<br>  <br>  The older the firearm you must have it tested by a license Gunsmith who will test the firearm for your safety and others, the older the firearm the better it will look good as a wall hanger after the firearm has been made in operable.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	It's considered to be the best bolt-action rifle ever issued for military service.  I've seen ads for such rifles, which are claimed to be WW2-vintage production but un-issued, at around $400 apiece.  Almost any firearms magazine you pick up will have at least one such ad.|`|QNX9NET3aa	The Kar98k or simply 98k is a German rifle. It is bolt action chambered for 8mm Mauser. They were used by Germany from the 30's until the end of ww2. There are many variants,some go for as little as $200 "Russian capture rifles" to several thousand dollars for sniper versions.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	They are C&R rifles<br>  Cost typically about $250 to $300

jvANtKf1aa	Nice question dude...<br>  Well yea he probably WOULD lose some practice...but as I said...SOME...He's an excellent player with a good potential...He probably would practice for hours and hours before the French Open '09 and would be back in action...It would only take it a while to get back on course.|`|3EOWx0Xoaa	All tennis pros can easily adjust their game for each surface.  There is an adjustment period, but for Rafa I believe after a day or two of practice on clay, he'll be even better than last year.  It's his favorite surface and suits his game more than any surface.<br>  <br>  Rafa had to learn what adjustments to make to become effective on hard court.  He had to change that way he hits, he had to adopt a more aggressive strategy to win the points earlier on hard court.  It took him a couple of years to make the adjustments.  All the while, he has gotten even better on clay as displayed by his utter dominance of the French Open last year.  On clay, he could and has just grinded his way to winning the point.  If anything, what he has done to adapt to hard court is going to make his clay court game even better.  With tennis, you don't trade in your weapons for new ones, you acquire more weapons to your arsenal.  Rafa still has his insane top spin forehand, but now he has a flatter forehand that he can use on put away shots.<br>  <br>  Are you aware that from 2005-2008, Rafa only lost 4 out of over 110 matches on a clay surface?  Nadal is going to dominate clay again this year, and probably for at least the next 3 years.|`|wx2UfKOdaa	nice observation...but u see there are two things in rafa's advantage ... one is he is a born clay court champion.... so its inbuilt in him... so the top spin  wont go away...and another thing ... i may be wrong but i think even in the australian open he did used the topspin to his advantage mostly...so as rafagirl said VAMOS RAFA.... sorry buddy i am too close a fan of rafa to say otherwise|`|GNq2rmrNaa	i agree man he is going to be heaps less lethal.|`|dmGbXwq9aa	no since muscle memory takes care of court switching|`|VefSnu0Gaa	not really, but we'll have to wait and see.-|`|RC3WoqFkaa	he'll probably have a flatter shot, but his shot would still have tons of topspin. he'll be less lethal, but will still win the french open easily.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	i hope not, but u do have a point, but flat forehands are what rafa needs to keep hitting if he wants to win more HC tournaments.<br>  <br>  but...i think as soon as rafa steps onto a clay court, his clay court game will just click itself in place, and the super duper loopy topspin forehands will be killing opponents like he has done so many many times before, its automatic for rafa.<br>  <br>  i hope rafa wins his 5th straight french open this year, but i hope that if roger does meet rafa in the final, it will not be a whitewash (i hate to see a repeat of last yr's final...so depressing). but i would like to see roger win french open as well.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	no probably not.... he is naturally more apt and keen on clay courts.. its like second nature to him to play on them.... aned because he is winning on ther surfaces.. his confidence will be right up there..<br>  <br>  it will be very easy for him to make some adjustments.... and even on clay he cannot just simply hit with alot of topspin.. sometimes he has to hit flat out winnners...<br>  <br>  i say he will do well there.........|`|n4dnIrBlaa	No, as you saw in his Australian Open final with Federer he played like he normally does on clay because that's how he beats Federer. He looked like he was on clay while he was on the hard court, I think he'll be even better this year then ever.|`|gCGbbIMcaa	Noooooo! Rafa is King Of Clay :) Sure it`ll take a few matches to get into the swing of things but he`ll do just fine :P !! As soon as he hits the clay courts, he`ll be awesome i have no doubt !! Vamos Rafa x x x|`|R5bEfaM9aa	i dont think so man but still i hope federer wins ;)
A3SvA2waaa	I think Owens would be a great investment for the Raiders. You better have coverage on Owens, especially if you have a power thrower like Russell. Jesus, can you imagine? What a duo that would be! <br>  <br>  Maybe Owens' attitude would be what Russell needs to get his *** into gear.|`|nfdlPfdQaa	TO is a problem wherever he goes. I don't think Russell could handle his mouth or locker room antics. He's a distraction despite his physical talents. He's not worth a team's overall success to put him on any roster. But while his stats are excellent, his attitude and lack of team spirit really tarnishes his career. Russell is just a kid. I think TO would be a negative.|`|AA11760438	THE RAIDERS..<br>  <br>  <br>  they need a WR T.O. needs a team.. <br>  <br>  Raiders love people like T.O.<br>  <br>  He was born to wear the Black..|`|uWM9LmPHaa	Can you say T.O. is a douchebag|`|UNd51PdPaa	^ No TO is worse than randy moss. look how Moss is now on the pats, no problems at all.  Moss just lacked motivation to work, TO on the other hand is a cancer and can destroy a team from the inside out. Raiders want to develop russell but if they sign TO it would hinder his growth. They would be taking 1 step froward and 3 steps back.|`|bpWlmcKiaa	It wouldn't hinder Russell's growth.  I mean, yeah...T.O. talks alot of trash and does things maybe he shouldn't.  But face it, he helps quarterbacks.  What quarterback has he hindered?  Jeff Garcia?  He's still getting it done even though he's closing in on 40.  McNabb?  He's considered one of the hottest players in the league right now.  Romo?  Even though he's considered a choker in the playoffs...as far as quarterbacks alone go, he's considered in the top tier in the league.  So if you ask me, although the relationships between them may fail...it seems pretty good luck in the long run if you throw T.O. the ball.|`|t1Rut5gKaa	Owens has to go to a team with an established leadership & tradition (i.e. Pittsburgh Steelers) for him to have no chance to be a cancer. But knowing Al Davis, he'll offer T.O. a nice contract if he thinks T.O. would come to Oakland. But T.O. may want to go to a team that has a shot at a Super Bowl, which means he could possibly go to the Patriots or Giants asking for a deal. More than anything, T.O. wants a Super Bowl ring, & Oakland doesn't offer that chance.|`|paIUgtLRaa	Can you say Randy Moss part II?|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Warren Sapp has retired and said going to the Raiders at the end was a mistake.  (Less politely than me, but that was the gist.)  If TO goes I give 5 games before he either acts up or quits on the team like Moss.  <br>  <br>  Rusell would only bean appetizer for TO.:)|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Patriots...TO would want to go to a contender...The question is would he be OK with being #2 to Randy Moss...

Nash is doing ok for an older team (different system), D'antoni's starting over, but Marion didn't do jack for the raps because it's not a system, they either bang it inside to bosh or have kapono or bargnani hit the jumper.

KgvUC9bzaa	A McDermott cue has a wood to wood joint with no metal insert, so it is possible to eventually strip the joint after a while. Although, if I remember correctly, the also have a lifetime warranty. But because of this style of joint, you will experience a "softer" or "looser" hit than you would with say a Schon or Joss. In my experience, I prefer this type of softer feel. It allows me to exercise my stroke with less effot. And in my opinion, it is especially helpful when developing your stroke.<br>  <br>   I know a few people who play with a McDermott who like them, but personally I don't.<br>  <br>  I personally have shot with many different kinds of sticks, and was even contemplating buying a Schon or Joss up until recently, but I decided to stick with the Meucci I've had for 7 years. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br>  <br>  PS...I know Meucci quality is crap now, and probably was even when I got my stick brand new...but if you can find a good one, I think you'll be satisfied.|`|MHo2SGPRaa	Pogi...I have heard the Star Mcdermott Cue doesn't play all that well....Its a cheap(er) offering and from my understanding it not even made by Mcdermott-But by an Asian Vendor...Mcdermott is a quality name don't get this wrong...Think of Mercedes trying to sell a Mercedes for $12,000-U know you wont get the same lever of refinement...This is what have heard from some of the major billiards site and I think even on Yahoo answers...(In other words its a $60 cue that is selling for $125 with the McDermott name) So you are basically paying for the name...However I did hear that Mcdermott inspects each and every cue..But the fact still stands..This is just fyi...Good luck|`|y5TTkgFYaa	Don't buy a McDermott onless it has the clover leaf symbol on the butt end.

lz8Y1ihzaa	I believe he gets frustrated because he just wants to win, and catch long passes for TD's.  I don't believe he is a bad person, or a bad player.  He just is really competitive.  I think it was a mistake for Dallas to release him.  It's a sad day in Big D.  No more sure-handed reeceiver #81 with the star on the helmet, and with "Owens" on the back of the jersey.  I hope that whatever team he ends up with, he frickin BURNS the cowboys every year, especially if it's an NFC team, like the GIANTS or the REDSKINS!   I hope he scores 3 td's a game against the Cowboys, and has 200 yards receiving!  I think they did him wrong, and Stephen Jones just bugged dear old dad to release T.O.  so much that Jerry had to act.  <br>  <br>  I think that any team with cap room can be a potential suitor to Mr. Owens, except for the obvious.  49ers, Eagles and Cowboys.  Before he signed with the Eagles, he was rumored to go to the Ravens, and said he didn't wanna play in Baltimore.  Could he be paired there with mr. Derrick Mason?!?!?  The Ravens could use him!  <br>  <br>  I'd love to see him in silver and black!|`|KzlyHEgraa	T.O. is going to a Super Bowl contender. <br>  Giants (To replace Plaxico)<br>  Eagles ( Gives them that deep ball threat that dosent throw the ball down 1 yard short of a TD like DeShaun Jackson)<br>  Titans (They need a clear cut #1 WR)<br>  Jets: I know there not a contender but if they can get Jeff Garcia and with the moves they made T.O. might consider it.<br>  Broncos: Marshall will probably get suspended for the season and with T.O. available they might jump at the oppertunity to get a player who has a big mouth and cries alot and dump a player who get in legal problems and get arrested and gets suspended. They could be a super bowl contender with Cutler throwing to Owens.|`|nTKNGajYaa	How about New England?  Why not?  They have some cap room now after trading away Matt Cassel.  If I'm not mistaken, Jabaar Gaffney signed elsewhere, leaving them with only Randy Moss and Wes Welker as proven WRs, and they like to have play alot of 3 WRs sets.  And if there's a team that's proven it can take in a player with a checkered past and make him a team player, it's the Patriots.  Plus, with the Patriots still being among the favorites to win the Super Bowl, I think Owens would love to play there and would probably take a salary that's not too high and loaded with incentives.  If I was the Patriots, I would seriously persue this.  <br>  <br>  To the Raiders?  I could see them going after him, but it wouldn't help him or the Raiders.  They need way more than 1 player to become a contender.  Plus, I think he'll want to play for a team that has a chance to win a Super Bowl, and the Raiders are nowhere close to that happening.|`|paIUgtLRaa	Davis is old enough and senile enough to do it again.<br>  <br>  Again?

LALDdLkNaa	He's a great guy who is respectful of his opponents and he's really down to earth. <br>  modest about his great acheivements despite what people say, he has done alot for the game of tennis as well and does alot of charity work.<br>  <br>  I cant see why anyone dislikes him ,so what if he got emotional after losing the final he was so close to equaling Sampras's record and he is entitled to show his emotions hes not a robot he didn't cry on purpose.<br>  <br>  Its mainly Rafa fans who hate him and its a shame some of the disrespect he gets from Rafa's fans ,as Rafa himself is good mates with roger and such a nice guy and great player who I personally really like and am a fan of as he is so down to earth as well and shows federer respect every time he plays him but his fan base can be such assholes when they talk about Federer.|`|tNZBZcumaa	Wow, I didn't even know about this. (didn't get to see most of the AO)  He was one of my favorites last year. He's a good player.      I would have to agree with Dylan R.|`|buCtn7guaa	i think he's a fine guy with a very fine style of playing tennis. <br>  hope this helps :)|`|PWIcfCbxaa	he is awsome but so is Nadal.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	well lets just say that before (2006, 2007), i was a really big fan of federer, i liked his game, the way he handled himself on the court, off the court, but now i have lost a bit of respect for him, nowadays i just see him as an egoistic guy, i mean he is a great champion who has achieved so much, and i will always be a big fan of his game, he plays such a smooth game, makes the hardest shots look like a walk in the park.<br>  <br>  but one thing i always noticed about him was the lack of credit he gave to opponents who got the better of him in a match, it is always an excuse (its almost like it wiould kill him if he said someone played better than him). <br>  i just do not like that, maybe because i am not like that, whenever my opponent plays better than me, i just shake their hand, and i acknowledge i just did not play good enough to beat them, as simple as that.<br>  <br>  but i think for roger, that may be a different situation because when u win 81 matches and only lose 4 (FOUR) matches in a year, u do not really know what to say when u get defeated (hope u understand what im trying to imply here...)<br>  <br>  and then, all this media hype about him being the GOAT, equalling the sampras record, it all got into roger's head.<br>  <br>  rafa is definitely a better player now, rafa has the edge mentally and physically over roger, rafa is an extremely deserving current world no.1, and roger himself has acknowledged that. i hope that roger will be able to keep playing well this year to be back at no.1 again, but it will be a pretty tall order, with the young guns nipping at his heels (djoker, murray, tsonga, verdasco- just to name a few).<br>  <br>  one thing that really irked me i guess was when roger was interviewed at kooyong, when interviewer asked him his main goals for 09: he said 'to win wimbledon again and get MY no.1 ranking back".<br>  <br>  sorry, but MY- it does not belong to him, gosh he sounded like a spoilt 5 year old who just had his lunchtime lollipop taken away from him, it sounded really arrogant and self-centred, i just hope that roger learns to be more humble when he loses and acknowledges that there are days when he does lose.<br>  <br>  about the crying...to be honest i dont feel for him, i mean the players he beat when he won his 13 slams, did any of them cry like he did? NO they didnt, even hewitt didnt break down (and he got whooped 6-0, 7-6, 6-0), and its not like fed got whooped in AO final (it was a 5 setter). his crying took away all the hard work rafa put in (he played 10 hours of tennis in SF and F to win the AO...that should have been rafa's moment).<br>  <br>  until fed changes his self-absorbed attitude, i will support rafa over him.<br>  <br>  sorry for the long reply, but i just felt like answering this question.|`|6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	Well, Roger needs to be more diplomatic in his press conferences and the media can be killing sometimes. Anyways, he has hired Darren Cahill as his coach and I am sure Roger will do a much better job at press conferences. Darren Cahill is a no nonsense coach and I hope he can teach Roger how to handle the media pressure and give better responses. I think that is one good decision taken by Roger lately which is going to pay off in the long run as far as his winning ways and mentality is concerned. He will be a much better person on and off the court because he has done best under Australian coaches. All the best to Rogi!|`|KReWaGFsaa	I think he's a very, very good player, but his attitude..

a5b9a79555f264da9d5ea0d5bf063582aa	Okay well I'll assume that your talking about 50 yards. i swim a 50 butterfly in 26.89 so I'm here to help. the best thing to do is to make sure you get a good start off of the blocks. you just need to explode from your legs there. once you hit the water immediately start your butterfly kick and stay underwater but right below the water until you feel its the right time to come up. then bring both your arms out of the water and make sure they are even with each other you don't want one leading the other then the next wall is coming up you wanna get of that as soon as you can. so this is just like a breast stroke turn touch your hands to the wall, lean your head back and at this time your legs should hit the wall and you can push off. stay underwater till its the right time to come up and keep your arms even then swim hard and fast and try not to breath into the wall or after the flags at the end and touch the pad. let me know how it goes.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  -charlie|`|kqreMM73aa	Get your hips up and catch shallow underwater.<br>  Breath every other stroke unless you can breath every stroke efficiently(fast and simple).  Always start a race for fly with a fast tempo because if you start, slowly, you are too tired to go faster so start fast and keep tempo constant.|`|FnLik0rVaa	This mite seem gay but i do it,<br>  sing a song in your head to kick to and make sure its like up beat<br>  i did that at my state meet last year for the first time and i droped 3 seconds.<br>  (:|`|zY3ixLW6aa	i dunno man, im not much of a swimmer, just do heaps of weights and get heaps of muscles and then u can challenge Phelps|`|ajXfV65jaa	I don't get what you mean by the 29's and 31's, but here's some advice, I've swam my whole life and love the butterfly. Anyway really you should work on that butterfly kick, that's what is going to get you going faster and leap higher out of the water. Also make sure you're arms are even and at the right rhythm with the movement of your body. It's like once you get it you really get it but I wish I could explain more, I demonstrate way better but good luck at your meet.<br>  Work the arms and the legs, your legs are your motor and you have to work them because seriously Your arms just help out... a lot.|`|POcR1GXOaa	Really work on your kick and get your core strength up to scratch. Although it seems like Butterfly is an upper body stroke, the fatigue comes from when core strength fails, if you have strong kick it will take the pressure off your shoulders and give you more stamina and speed.|`|AA10729271	Well i swam competitively for several years in my early youth (freestyle was my best stroke) and I was never that great an butterfly, but it is mainly an upper body stroke and it is harder for girls to do than guys, so anything like push ups or pull ups will help immensely, though it would take several weeks of conditioning to make a big difference, so you should start but don't expect results after just a week, in a month yes.|`|WJcH24xCaa	Get your whole body moving in a wave like motion. And make sure when your lifting your arms, lift your shoulders too.<br>  Kick really hard and make sure you have a good streamline off the blocks.  If your going longer than 50 make sure you get a good streamline off the wall.<br>  Good Luck!

8T0Z0Y17aa	Now as an Englishman this is highly unauthodox to go for an Aussie but I say North.<br>  <br>  Think of the situation: This guy's on debut, has seen part of the order collapse earlier on already and is facing one of the best bowling attacks in the world.<br>  <br>  Also, most of the others were made on dead, flat wickets. Not to say they weren't good knocks, but almost anyone (Including Geoff Boycott's grandmother!) could have made runs on them.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	I'd go for North's hundred.

Not only because he scored his century on debut, but also because that century turned the game totally in Australia's favour. Australia were in deep touble when North walked in to bat, after losing Clarke, Hussey and Ricky in quick succession. But still, North batted superbly with a tailender and that ton deserved every praise it got.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	You gotta judge the innings on how well that person helped his team get out of a sticky situation.. <br>  I would rate debutant Norths innings as the best so far, as that match could have gone either way at that stage..

AFkjkqcSaa	Firstly running everyday is not a good idea.  Your muscles and shins need a couple or few days rest!! Yur body needs to repair itself for the next run.  I had shin splints and was adviced to bring the calf muscle in line with the shin and strap it with tape, and it worked!!  I had them so bad at one point the pain went in2 my back.  <br>  I have been told that rubbing ice on the shins after a run also works.  Also try investing in some proper running shoes, shin splints can ormally be a result of crap trainers. x|`|1MX8ENzXaa	For shin splints use a contrast bath.  Soak your legs in ice water up to the knee for one minute then in warm water for one minute, repeat 5-10 times.  To prevent shin splints a good non-impact warm up is important, use a bike or ellipsoidal for 10-15 minutes before running.  Non-impact refers to how hard your feet hit the ground, not how hard you work.  The idea is to increase the blood flow through your legs.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	go to doctor! not run for 2 weeks. but walk.

9eyu5oaiaa	Right, I can't believe i have to do another one of these but... here goes.<br>  <br>  You're not going to walk into WWE. You have no wrestling training or exeprience. You won't get into ROH. You have no training or experience. You wouldnt even get into my old UK based promotion. You have no training or experience.<br>  <br>  You want to go into professional wrestling? Start learning. You're young and athletic right? Look up a local wrestling school. Ask them about what they offer. Decide if it's right. Train with them. I started at age 14. I didnt even get an option to job a match till I was 18 (four years long hard experience) Luckily, promotions keep their eyes open for talent. I got spotted by our sister promotion and went on to wrestle for them for a good few years. <br>  <br>  Size and weight aren't factors. I'm 5'7 and at my peak I was 180-195lbs. Who cares what you can bench? Can you take back-bumps for three hours, then run on and off the ropes for thirty minutes. THEN wrestle a shoot match? Thats basic training. My guess is No as you've never tried but whats stopping you?<br>  <br>  You wanna get anywhere in pro wrestling, you work at it. Vince isn't going to just knock on your door one day and say "hey, heres a million dollars a year, come work for me". Theres so much effort and dedication that you need to put into it. Working out, eating right, training, working a job (unless you're loaded), travelling to and from matches, watching tapes, learning. Its a mountain of stuff. Can you handle it? If you can.. why are you still reading this? Get your *** to a local promotion and show them you've got the testicles to be someone.|`|gfxXikenaa	good luckk|`|VJhojJ0Vaa	You can lift 210? Nice.

If I were you I would find the closest wrestling school near you and set yourself up for training.

Good luck.|`|plhLIIeAaa	gain about 100 more lbs of lean muscle and you might just have a shot at getting a tryout.

3EOWx0Xoaa	Make sure you have actual tennis shoes or court shoes and not just sneakers or running shoes.  Basket ball and volley ball shoes are ok too.<br>  <br>  If you sweat a lot, wear a hat or head band to keep the sweat out of your eyes and an absorbent wrist band to keep your hand and racquet dry.  A string dampener on the racquet is a good idea.<br>  <br>  Private lessons and practice are the best way to improve.<br>  <br>  When the ball is coming to you, keep your eyes on the ball, once you execute the swing, keep your head still and watch the point of contact until your swing is complete.  Then, watch your opponent until they hit the ball.<br>  <br>  You have to be patient.  This cannot be stressed enough or repeated too many times.  If you give up easily with other things, don’t even bother to play tennis with the intention of becoming a really good tennis player.  Every time you think you have gotten better, you will have a bad day, bad week, or bad month and feel like all the lessons and practice time you've put in were a complete waste of time and money.  There will be times when you will play someone you've been able to beat easily 100 times before and then one day they will kick your butt.  There will be times when you will be playing the best you've ever played but still get totally stomped.  You will have days where you will feel like an all-powerful god of tennis that makes it seem like you could beat anyone in the world; Shots you could have never made before will be flying off your racquet with grace and ability that you didn't even think was possible.  Then, literally the very next day, you'll feel like you couldn't get the ball to do anything but get caught by the net or bounce outside the lines. The most frustrating part about it is you will have no idea, no clue, or evening a flicker of hope to understand what changed from the day before.  I have come home from a match no less than 20 times declaring I was finished with tennis forever, that I hated it and would never swing a racquet again just to be pining for the courts a day or two later.  <br>  <br>  All that and I still say I love playing tennis more than any other clothed activity.  There is nothing that feels better to me than a perfectly executed serve, ground stroke, or volley.  There's no way to describe the feeling when you bust it hard to make it to that shot and hear your opponent gasp in amazement that #1 you actually made it to that ball in time and #2 that you hit that good of a shot from what your opponent thought was their winner.  It can be a very rewarding sport on many levels.<br>  <br>  I play tennis.

Which have the most overpowered players like fernando torres, messi and ronaldo. Easiest way to defend those teams is to have 5 defensive players and 3 strikers at front.

The reason Barcelona is so good is because they have 3 center midfielders instead of the traditional 2.  The wing play is also more involved in attack, which then gives some chances for the wing backs to do damage.  Even though all the 4-3-3 teams have one excellent striker (Eto'o, Ibrahimovic, Benzema), they're still only one striker.  You need at least 2 center backs and and 2 wing backs to cover the speedy offense.  If you're using a defending midfielder, he can also help out on defense. If that happens then it will be a 5 on 3.<br>  <br>  I think your best formation is 4-5-1, which I think is pretty similar to 4-1-4-1.  The outside midfielders do not go out all the way on the wing so they can help out defending, plus you have two attacking midfielders that also help out.  Your center midfielder also has more control for the team.  Your midfield has a a 5 on 3.  On attack, you only have one striker, but you have two attacking midfielders that can attack as strikers and it becomes a 3 on 2 for your offense since the wing backs are busy defending the outside midfielders.  The Defense has 2 wing backs and 2 center backs, so it's a 4 on 3 or sometimes a 5 on 3 for your defense.  <br>  <br>  Pass better, create more chances, and pressure your opponents.  hope it helps :D

LnJjS8BRaa	Ok, my cartoon watching skills are going to bridge the gap on this one.<br>  <br>  As has been said, jutsu is as word that means art or technique. It is used in many places in Japanese martial arts.<br>  <br>  Chakra is an Indian concept that somewhat aligns with chi (Chinese) and ki (Japanese). They all have their own meanings but as generalized concepts they kind of do the same thing. Incidentally some can argue that the soul is yet another variation on the same concept but I won't get into that.<br>  <br>  In Naruto they use chakra to add super power to their techniques. This doesn't exist in reality.<br>  <br>  Dragonball, Naruto and Bleach all use a kind of energy to do the same thing (super strength, speed and energy attacks). They all use different terms so they don't get accused of ripping one another off. I'm sure there are many more examples but these are the three I'm most familiar with\came to mind.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn a martial art you don't have to have super powers. The training itself will never give you super powers. It will give you skills that could seem extraordinary to novices or people with no training of their own, but it isn't magic.<br>  <br>  Find out what's available in your area and check them out. Pick a school that is taught the best. The style isn't as important as the quality of your teacher. You will also have to work hard but that is every bit as important as the quality of your teacher.<br>  <br>  Martial arts are great and are something you can do your entire life. Just understand that cartoons are embellished and quite frankly fantasy. Accept both for what they are and train hard. Good luck.|`|hlqj0pvxaa	This is NOT the cartoon section.|`|AA10744471	You can do jutsu anytime without chakra.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Yes, but only in a place called Reality.<br>  <br>  Jutsu i simply Japanese for "technique".

0xfVyxxIaa	They're referring to the fact that less than 10 years ago the NZRU (or NZRFU as it was then) was continuing a long held policy of not allowing a coach who'd taken up a contract with a foriegn Rugby Union to coach the All Blacks or a Super 12 franchise.<br>  <br>  This policy was changed and Henry was allowed to return from the UK and coach the Blues and then the All Blacks.<br>  It's believed by many that the change was a political one forced by associates of Henry himself.|`|iaZewr3waa	Last year the All Blacks lost the world cup. Losing the world cup means the coach loses his job.<br>  It means if he's gonna want the law to be changed allow players to just walk in, the same goes with coaches.

Xm8crry3aa	I would give the edge to Ali. Ali by close 15 round decision. His foot and hand speed would be the difference. Larry Holmes is in my top 5 of all time for his jab and his adaptability. This would have to be the very best Ali to win this battle.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Ali would have take Larry had they fought even six years earlier, but Ali was almost 15 years past his prime when they fought.  The Ali that beat George Foreman was actually past Ali's prime. The Ali that fought Liston was a bit green, and still improving.  Unfortunately for the boxing world, Ali's prime was spent without a boxing license due to his political controversy surrounding the draft and the Vietnam war, so the world never really saw a "prime" Ali.<br>  <br>  Ali at his best would have taken apart his old sparring partner.|`|rgPmkqwXaa	Ali rules!|`|dh48AkbCaa	ali was too quick, even for someone of holmes' calibre.|`|9SN1ARBfaa	blogbaba, the guy above me hit the nail on the head.|`|7ee20c636689b077d17c6e894f070f8eaa	float like a butterfly, sting like a bee...nuff said|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	ali late round ko i say 12th|`|AA10744471	It would be a great fight, but Ali would win the fight either by decision or a knockout. In his prime, Ali was the best, and Holmes was only a sparring partner who was trying to learn the ropes. So, in all probability, Ali could win the fight when the two are in their primes. In the actual fight between Holmes and Ali, Holmes was in his prime but Ali was already old yet Ali did not perform as poorly as expected, although he lost the fight.

HBK vs Jericho stole the show.<br>  You should add that the Undertaker & Nathan Jones match was a handicap match at the end of the day.|`|w2nMrQzwaa	tbh i think wm 17 was far better|`|a5RuNJ47aa	id have to agree with you and say wrestlemania 19 was better but 17 was really just as good.... <3

AA11512717	in general i would say it should meet at your chin.  it also depends on what you like. the longer the board the faster you go and harder it is to turn. the shorter it is will take some speed away but be more manuverable.  But a safe bet is to the chin. I am 5'8"ish and i like to ride a 155|`|AA11246540	Yes it should go to your chin, if you weigh more than the average person for your height you might get a bigger board to compensate for more weight.

ac0430cb7c89c549357007dfc6bbcd74aa	hai assolutamente ragione!!!<br>  a me totti piace tecnicamente ma è troppo montato, la + grande soddisfazione x un calciatore è essere convocato in nazionale ma lui "nn è pronto fisicamente"...ma io mi kiedo in campionato puoi giocare e in nazionale no...<br>  ke gran cagata!!!!<br>  kiss<br>  kabby|`|0b65c77728789aeeb255ab0a79e6c51caa	Secondo me bisognerebbe rispettare il regolamento. Se non sbaglio il regolamento dice che chi è convocato in nazionale o si presenta o non può più essere convocato.<br>  Secondo me Totti, visto che ha rifiutato, non ha + il diritto di giocare nella nazionale.|`|0d1cfce830c9febf1f6a8030f2f6beccaa	La cosa pazzesca è che ci sia ancora gente che rompe con questa storia, quando è stato chiarito da tempo che tornerà dopo essersi rioperato...e non decide quando andare ha solo chiesto una pausa fino a settembre per motivi fisici.<br>  <br>  Guardate qui la sua caviglia dopo l'infortunio:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAT7dLxdqSA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAT7dLxdq...</a><br>  <br>  In quello stato 3 mesi dopo ha fatto un mondiale!!!<br>  <br>  Totti per il mondiale ha rischiato tantissimo e sta ancora pagando quello sforzo, ora gioca bene ma non come prima e ha bisogno di riposo, si allena poco fa quasi sempre fisioterapia....lo volete capire che non è al massimo e che non può sostenere tutte le partite! Questa pausa per la nazionale è fondamentale per lui per rimettersi a posto e riposare.<br>  <br>  Meriterebbe solo un pò più di rispetto per quello che ha fatto per la nazionale, invece solo cattiverie gratuite durante e dopo il mondiale! E poi parlate di rispetto...il primo a non venire rispettato è proprio Totti!|`|XP0ZN8JFaa	onestamente non è giusto, ma calcola che totti è una delle colonne portanti della nazionale... non dimenticare che è lui che ci ha regalato i quarti di finale|`|293a43e9a918a3bc8d38bbd96e1a21ffaa	Io invece ti rispondo con un altra domanda come mai solo in Italia succede questo? Posso o no decidere io del mio destino?Ho vinto un mondiale e voglio lasciare la Nazionale perchè non posso farlo? Possibile che un calciatore quando ha vinto qualcosa d'importante non può lasciare?|`|4MFEqeoaaa	no lui in nazionale ci verra` quando saremmo qualificati se ci qualificheremo, cosi verra a fare il peso morto della nazionale negli europei come ha gia` fatto per i mondiali<br>  aggiungo poi che totti anche prima dell`infortunio in nazionale non c`e` mai andato volentieri, tipo le amichevoli non le ha mai disputate.<br>  la nazionale vince anche senza totti|`|bp6quiguaa	totti e' un personaggio mediatico, e quindi l'attenzine dei media e' concentrata su ogni cosa che fa.<br>  totti ha detto a donadoni che per giocare ad alti livelli non puo' portare avanti si la roma che la nazionale, ha subito un danno non indifferente alla caviglia, e buttare tutto a rotoli per aver tirato troppo la corda a 30 anni e' un attimo, a mio parere sia totti che donadoni sanno consensualmente e con totale tranquillita' che il gicatore non sara' mai piu in azzzurro, ma si sono comunque lasciti una porta aperta, perche' non si sa mai, e sono solo i media che fanno rumore sul caso.|`|cce41e064d1d97aa02c9e0380b357144aa	totti secondo me è il migliore giocatore italiano, e farei fatica ad escluderlo dalla nazionale, ma se lo meriterebbe<br>  <br>  se fossi il ct lo convocherei ogni volta (cosi rischia la squalifica in campionato)<br>  <br>  la storia della caviglia non regge, visto che gioca tutte le partite sia in campionato che in champions, e non credo che siano quelle 3-4 partite della nazionale che gli possano fare male<br>  <br>  ...  e pensare che R.Baggio non lo convocavano e ci sarebbe andato anche con una gamba sola!|`|gp2vYC9daa	La penso esattamente come te Stefano,è una mancanza di rispetto per gli altri giocatori,quello che sta facendo il signor Totti,se per lui è un peso andare in Nazionale lo dica chiaramente e si ritiri,come ha fatto Maldini nel 2002...Secondo poi,è troppo pompato dai giornali,manco fosse Maradona,e a parte uno scudetto non ha vinto nulla di importante in Europa,figurarsi se avesse vinto quanto Alex Del Piero,Maldini e Costacurta quanta spocchia avrebbe.|`|01a703d1ed8fbad2ebc681927bc31cb0aa	Eccone un altro...Non c'è peggior sordo di chi non vuol capire, se volete attaccare sempre Totti ok fate pure ma cercate almeno di farlo in modo onesto, il professore che ha operato Totti gli ha detto per un anno devi fare una scelta o la Roma o la nazionale troppi impegni non puoi prenderli, ma lo sapete che Totti dopo ogni partita non si allena e fa fisioterapia? Totti ha parlato con Donadoni fin dall'inizio esponendogli il problema e si sono messi daccordo per non convocare Totti fino a giugno di quest'anno, ma non è che Totti dice a giugno sono pienamente recuperato e allora mi devi convocare per forza, se servo mi convochi altrimenti me ne sto a casa, è chiaro adesso? Ovviamente per gli anti-Totti no! Poi cercate di mettervi daccordo, dite che Totti alla nazionale non serve ma gli rompete le palle se non ci va! Non lo apprezzate? E allora ce lo teniamo noi, qual'è il grande problema?|`|f30dffd5fc2881582e710a6a9b8a3908aa	che ci possiamo fare, è uno dei nostri talenti calcistici migliori, insieme ad altri che non ve3ngono nominati... sono i vizi delle star del pallone

Wn0Hj7H4aa	Ask Cheney,s victim. Depending on the load,choke,range and gage,i'd say yes.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	*  Number 4 bird shot is recommend for in home defensive ammo.*|`|itiLu3dRaa	Sure fill a sock with it and you could beat someone to death.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	There is no such thing as non-lethal shotgun ammunition.  Only live and inert.  All live rounds are potentially deadly if you're asking about getting shot by the shotgun.  Even so called "less lethal" rounds are potentially lethal.<br>  <br>  If you're asking about subsequent ingestion of the pellets and related lead poisoning, no not enough lead will dissolve during digestion to matter.|`|GDJGNYFcaa	I think by BB or birdshot you mean 7.5 or 8 shot. At close range they'll make soup out of anything and the best doctor in the world couldn't remove every single pellet from a person shot with it. Multiple shots would only make things nastier. This of course depends on your choke and the powder load behind the shot. They're a good "non-lethal" round to chamber ahead of buckshot and slugs in your home defense gun. Omit the slugs if you're not in a rural area.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Absolutely, regardless of shot size.  From 10 feet, a 12 gauge full of #8 bird shot is going to make one big hole in someone.  However, true "Buck Shot", such as 00 and 000 is recommended for home defense.  <br>  <br>  No one with any experience recommends #4 for this purpose, which is why there are no readily available lead #4 loads...they are all steel or other non-toxic shot...specifically for waterfowl.|`|kKMc9UEJaa	It is possible, but its not a recommended shotshell load for self-defense. Birdshot is mostly for BIRDS after all. I test all sorts of loads and every gun has its own like but as any person who study's self-defense will tell you, use buckshot for self-defense. Hornady TAP-FPD buckshot is a prime example. Federal offers all kind of great 00-buckshot in both Vital-Shok (though I cant find any hardly) and the more popular Power-Shok (the blue box).<br>  Which ever you do choose, I hope you never have to shoot at a human, but its always a good idea to be prepared.<br>  <br>  "Walk softly but carry a big stick" -- Theodore Roosevelt|`|VP48PjM9aa	Absolutely yes.  I have in my home defense weapon Federal Premium 12Ga. 3 1/2" Mag Shock 21/4 oz. #5 Magnum Turkey Loads.  For those of you who say that these loads aren't killers, you have no clue.  At 20 yards the cloud of shot is the size of a softball.  At distances in the home, it will blow a big hole in any man sized target, period.  Buckshot will over penetrate, depending on the construction of you home.  It could go through walls, killing family members, and even through your house killing your neighbor.  Do not do it.|`|VPAMzE3uaa	Uhm, yeah, it can be.  Even non-lethal weapons can be lethal (the RCMP killed a visitor from Polland in Vancouver with their tazers last year).<br>  <br>  Not planning anything, I hope...|`|CTSYw8yaaa	It would depend on a number of factors,some of which would be where the pellet impacted on the body,and at what range.|`|xOkwpFX2aa	Defiantly, a bb in the right spot would kill a human, why do you think people use buckshot for deer?|`|GQZDcfUiaa	Absolutely, if one pellet hits the right spot.|`|WXzlqZfTaa	any kind of gun (including a bb gun ) is leathal it just has to hit the right spot.|`|datmqg7Aaa	Yes shot size 2 and up can kill a human within 30yds.|`|ustbT6QWaa	It depends how powerfull the gun is and were abouts you get shot at it also depends what rage u are at
FZRWMc3Baa	Sure, they'll win a lot, until the last three weeks of the season, of course.|`|AA11720887	No chance against the Phillies unless they have injuries. The Mets could make the playoffs as the wild card but they don't have the horses to beat out the Phils.|`|TWol6a30aa	Nope, just another year to choke.|`|5FypDafWaa	no you will not|`|KR1FdEZgaa	i think they will win the east this year. i also think the cubs dodgers and reds will make the playoffs. in al i think the redsox twins,angels, and yankees will go. ws dodger and redsox. yes i said the reds will make the playoffs. i am a dodger fan.|`|Ng0MKmxaaa	No, this is the year the Cubs finally win it all.|`|AA10522974	Phillies will win the East and repeat the World Series.|`|rv7rzYMlaa	na another colapse look at the yanks they have a good chance|`|A5p9g4tMaa	no ws will be Yankees cubs with Yankees winning|`|GwawzO5Faa	There are some concerns with their rotation. A lot of maybes there.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I think they'll do well.<br>  <br>  The Brooklyn Dodgers collapsed on the last day of the 1950 and 1951 season, losing to the Phillies in 1950 and the NY Giants in 1951.<br>  <br>  Then they won the NL penants in 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956. They kept the core of players intact, and each year improved the rest of the roster.<br>  <br>  By improving their bullpen, the Mets have essentially done the same thng, and hopefully will have the same outcome.<br>  <br>  Go Mets!!!

The cowboys made a mistake. Roy Williams is good but things would have been so mucher easier with t.o. there is no way you can double t.o. williams and witten, now they just have to stop roy. Tony Romo was the problem he is to turnover prone to be in charge of handling the ball. He has been expose and is just an average quaterback, far from great. Sure t.o. needs to watch what he says, but he wants to win. he was quiet until there season just got out of control. Jason Garrett can also be at fault for not getting roy involved. cowboys will never return to dominance as long as wade, tony and garrett are there.|`|ZeN4IEVPaa	I believe that the Raiders are the most logical, mainly b/c their owner is dumber than Jerry Jones. I think that the Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs would be the only teams willing to take T.O. I can see the Raiders doing it for this upcoming season to get Russell a big target, same with Cassel in KC.|`|KzlyHEgraa	T.O. wont go to the Raiders, he wants a Super Bowl ring and he wont get it there.The Titans Possably to give them that boost to the next level ot mabye the Giants since Plaxico could be facing a minimum of 3 years in prison if he's convicted. Or he could find himself back in Philly. But  i think that the most likley place is Minnesota. They missed out on TJ so they are still looking for the big time WR and TO is that guy.|`|5gKGtSriaa	Some place, but where ever he goes there will be conflicts, but the team will do better.<br>  <br>  I hope he doesn't go to my Panthers or especially to the Jags. I think he'll go to...maybe the Pats, it could be like millitary camp and maybe they could striaghten him up. What ever it is, count that it'll be with a blue and white jersey. Giants?|`|zg0Iricdaa	No idea but it shows some major balls on the Cowboys part.

But that is less things for us Redskins fans to worry about. He probably made them release him because he didn't want to see Deanglo Hall twice a year|`|pnlvObEdaa	GIANTS|`|N4TYCu7Xaa	next year i think|`|hfEGHKePaa	I agree with Rasheans' Tiger eye, I don't care where T.O. ends up as long as it's not on the Panthers. <br>  <br>  T.O.'s stock way down for perhaps anyone to pick him up to even start with, since his attitude is so negative and since he's such a distraction...not to mention his actual ability has decreased by about 60%.<br>  <br>  All in all, T.O. should just retire.|`|3dpdQssvaa	probably oakland al davis still has not grown up.|`|0fQk2spXaa	I think the team he goes to will have to have an established coach and a veteran QB.  TO's presence will be to much for a new coach or a young QB to handle.<br>  I also don't see him going to a very bad team or a very good team.  There would be no reason for either of these teams to put up with his crap.<br>  So it would have to be a team with an established coach and a veteran QB who feels like it's missing a WR to help them get over the hump.<br>  By that criteria, I think New Orleans makes the most sense.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	I'd say, "definitely not the Patriots."   But I've been wrong on that before.  As Tedy Bruschi said of Randy Moss, "Players leave their baggage at the airport."<br>  <br>  If TO says anything to the media Richard Seymour or somebody throws him into the lockers and tells him he's not helping.

AA11694178	Beautiful taxidermy without formal training is possible in the same way a beautiful painting or sculpture is possible without formal training.  There are techniques to learn such as how to properly skin and animal and how to prepare the hide for mounting.  These things can be learned from books.  The things that are difficult to learn from books are the various artistic parts.  If you have an artful eye and can present the animal in a pleasing way, and will take the time to go to the library and read up on the technical aspects, you can perform a very nice piece of taxidermy without going to a formal school.  Combine this with practice, practice, and more practice and you will achieve your taxidermy desires.|`|rZmiyAqJaa	Van Dykes has some very good kits for things like rabbits, squirrels, grouse, ducks, pheasant, etc... they come with everything you need, including instructional dvd's. They are really inexpensive too, most around $30-45. I started using them years ago as a way to get started and now have 'graduated' into being able to do my own deer, turkeys, even made a beautiful coyote with grouse mount. I no longer need a taxidermist and have a great time and take great pride in doing everything myself. Everybody tells me that they cannot tell mine from the others I had done by professionals. Some of my buds even ask me to do their stuff now...<br>    It's a cheap, fun way to get started. It is not nearly as hard as you may think, really all the work is in the skinning and prep...which is even covered on the dvds.<br>      Good luck and have fun if you go this route.....|`|rcpZ6n7Zaa	that really depends on your level of skill. However, I would definetly recommend learning from somebody who knows what they're doing, and have been doing it for a while. I tried a squirrel (wildlife management high school project. Yes, I live in Georgia.) and it turned out hideous. I'm not a big critic of my own work, but it was truely horrible. The leg got cut off, so I made a peg leg out of a stick. Learn from the best, perform the best to your ablilty, and the results will reflect your effort.|`|to8Vpp0zaa	CIH gave you a very good answer.

2C8Kjj78aa	Keep on playing until one team wins by 2 points.  In some tournaments there might be a cap.  Gordon quoted you the USAV rule that governs scoring in matches that use their rules.  <br>  <br>  My team had a match go to 5 this season and the score of the deciding set was 29-27.  It was intense -- there were so many match points along the way.  (We won, whew!)  I felt pretty wrung out after that one was over!|`|085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	Officially, the answer is they have to play to win by 2.  However, some tournaments decide on a cap.  The rule books say to win by 2.|`|r6Ol5jpGaa	you have to win by 2 points. so it would still go on. in some leagues they cap it off at like 25, but no one really does that.|`|PJQ1Nm1Oaa	It depends on what the cap is.

8Sw8rJgtaa	Sugar Ray Robinson is probably number 1 followed by Willie Pep,Henry Armstrong,Harry Greb,Sam Langford,Roberto Duran,Benny Leonard,in no particular order|`|nfdlPfdQaa	All were great fighters. I believe Willie Pep fought 220 fights and only lost 10, Sugar Ray was tremendous, but always ran into Don or Gene Fullmer.

WAGAcLPMaa	Right now, no. There's a huge unbalance between the top heels and top faces for the WWE. If Cena became heel, that'd leave Jeff Hardy as the only young, proven main event good guy. The rest of them are near retirement or are still climbing up the ranks.<br>  <br>  In the future, when there's a number of good young faces to immediately take his spot, by all means, turn Cena heel. He'd pull off an amazing heel, look how well he worked the crowd vs. Rob Van Dam at One Night Stand. But right now is not the right time.|`|w2nMrQzwaa	yes, he definitely needs to turn heel (bad guy), i agree that it has to be something big, an attack on someone or screwing someone out of a title, something like that. He should bring back the thuggish gimmick|`|F5JXQUEAaa	Yeah I would like it if he turns heel, that would be huge.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	no bc he is a fan wrestler and the fan wrestlers seem to bring in more money and well we all know how vince loves his money|`|kZPFCPHVaa	I would love to see John Cena as the bad guy! But unfortunatley the little kids age 10 and under love Cena and buy Cena's gear which gives Vince a lot of money. If Vince turns Cena bad kids won't buy his gear and Vince will lose money. So even though we want Cena to turn bad he won't because of how much the little kids love him.|`|UYPfC5YVaa	I think it's already overdue. Do you have in mind of any WWF/E superstar that didn't became a bad guy? I don't think there is one. That is the style of WWE, to try each of every superstar to make a change of persona, and try to discover which is what the fans wants or likes more of them.|`|77b5BDf3aa	NO he will never be, the kids love him and he is Vinces biggest money maker so why would he mess with a good thing. I like Cena as a good guy and I hate change so yah.|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	Noooo he is great the way he is...|`|9ttLI7S5aa	is it time to yes, but wil it happen no not anytime soon|`|QbC6aIQ2aa	Yes i sure do|`|u2J0ZuR1aa	nah wwe is silly if it does stupid stuff like that|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	maybe because now he often lost to make he win a match he have to become dirty superstar like edge and randy orton|`|AA10744471	If Vince is convinced that he will make more money by turning Cena into a bad guy, he will do so right away. You know Vince! For him, money is everything.

LskV3FcAaa	I think there is some validity to what they are suggesting about "snapping" the ball. This is especially true when you watch players hit a ball that was over-passed. However, this is mostly due to them hitting that way out of necessity as they are usually right at the net to be in blocking position. <br>  <br>  The only criticism I have about snapping the ball is that this is usually the technique to try and hit the ball straight down. While hitting the ball straight down is pretty and it feels great, there are times that this is the wrong technique (such as hitting off the block, or even hitting over a block). If there is a block up, hitting straight down isn't the technique you want to be using as the ball will end up on your side of the net. <br>  <br>  Every hitting technique has it's time and place. Great hitters (in my experience) aren't one trick ponies. They usually have a myriad of hits for different situations.
wXxJUnLJaa	I doubt the Suns will even get to the playoffs|`|AA10744471	I hope so. Amare is always a plus in any team.

AA10119248	Goo Gone,,,,,,,,or WD40|`|KoNX22Faaa	Lighter fluid.   Once you try it you'll use it all the time to get rid of the adhesive residue left behind when removing a sticker or tape from something.   Most non-aqueous organic solvents would probably work as well but Ronson's lighter fluid is inexpensive, easily found and the nozzle shoots a very fine stream.   If the stickers are intact, the lighter fluid may not easily penetrate a glazed or plasticized surface, so peel off as much of the stickers as you can, leaving bare paper that can absorb the fluid down to the adhesive layer.|`|xRQfCdKOaa	The guys above me are correct.Lighter fluid, wd40 and goo be gone all work well. Just make sure you 1st try it in a place that won't be noticed. Just to make sure it doesn't ruin the finish.

wXxJUnLJaa	Try looking on there team websites|`|HcSQPUYWaa	AND1 is a broke *** company now.  They are so desperate, they are now endorsing MMA fighters, no joke.  This is a basketball company?  Streetball existed before AND1.  AND1 rode the wave of streetball popularity from it's roots, to it's own television shows, and by their own doing, caused it's overexpose and decline. AND1's games were originally free and open to the public, but when they started having shows in NBA arenas and trying to make money off the game, it was the beginning of the end.  Now AND1 is a joke.  But at least streetball is going back to where it belongs, the streets, where it is in it's purest form.

jM7CyxQzaa	It's a buildup of lactic acid in your muscles and shock and strain on them, if you've only just started after a very long lay off I'd take it easy coming back, have lots of hot baths to relieve the pain and possibly take some arnica which is a natural medicine. If the pain is really bad then cut the distance down until you're not getting the pain or it's easier to deal with.<br>  <br>  Be sure to warm up and cool down properly before and after each run.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	bgibbslmt is right, its not lactic acid.  The stresses from running tear down muscles, which have to build back up.  This stress is highest when you first start, since your muscles are not used to it.  <br>  <br>  I say take a day off.  Its not pleasant to run while you're sore, one workout isn't worth the aggravation of running sore.|`|1MX8ENzXaa	It's not lactic acid.  Lactic acid is flushed from the muscles as soon as oxygenated blood get to the muscle.  Be sure to stretch well after running and maybe try a cold bath or shower, it works on race horses it'll work on you.  You could also think about getting massage on a regular basis.
a6444f0c02bb966546af443063e02867aa	When you're on the skateboard, rotate the back edge of the board back, but only slightly.  Make sure that both your feet stay on the wheels of the skate board or it will over-rotate and you will fall.  As long as your feet stay on the wheels, you will have a better chance of staying in primo.  <br>  To get out, use your best foot and press down on the tail of the board.  If you press it just enough to do a 270 degree horizontal rotation, you will land back in regular (or goofy).  Make sure to try this while stable on asphalt or another rough surface with minimal movement.  Be comfortable with doing this while motionless before trying to be Rodney Mullen.<br>  Good luck bro.|`|b1d465e3f1d640cfa62fa7da1c537d20aa	Step 1: Stand on the board without moving.<br>  Step 2: Place your right foot on the BACK edge of the board, near the wheel (opposite for goofy)<br>  Step 3: Lift left foot up as you press down hard with the right foot on the edge. This should cause the board to begin to flip into a primo position.<br>  Step 4: Land your feet on the wheel section of the board when the board is in the correct position.|`|e4da3735ae308218ddacaf183a38f856aa	yeah work hard and don't give up go to local events as much as you can, and also hope there are scouts watching you.

nUTubwScaa	Che la lazio giochi bene in questo momento è sotto gli occhi di tutti.<br>  Prima di riprendere la mia Roma però mancano ancora sette punti.<br>  La palla è rotonda e la Roma ha la Champions, per cui potrebbe accadere, però aspettate a parlare, no?<br>  Ovviamente, vista la partenza del campionato e la (MINI)penalizzazione, il secondo posto per la Lazio varrebbe sì uno scudetto.|`|2ef14de7fec995e63b420b03840504e0aa	Roma o Lazio? chi arriverà seconda??????<br>  Io penso che passerà la Lazio, solo se la Roma supera i quarti.

Dedicato a chi sta piangendo da un anno sulle penalizzazioni (leggasi Milan).<br>  <br>  Devo dire però che il secondo posto della Roma avrebbe un significato maggiore perchè i giallorossi hanno comunque conteso lo scudetto all'inter e, anche se ultimamente hanno mollato, si meritano di arrivare secondi. Viceversa la lazio non è mai stata in lizza e il secondo posto è frutto solo di un girone di ritorno spettacolare. <br>  Quindi io spero che arrivi seconda la Roma.

Purtroppo sono imbecilli vedi come si comportano quando vanno in trasferta e non parlo solo di quando vengono in Italia ma anche negli altri paesi, spero che dopo il Manchester il Milan dia una bella lezione anche al Liverpool, anche se mi sembra che il Liverpool sia meno presuntuoso ed arrogante che la squadra del Manchester.

c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	I believe it was a 2 year 6 million dollar contract with a 3 million dollar signing bonus.  And you're right about it not being his fault.  Schaub is a lot slower than David Carr, he'll be on his back alot this season.  We'll get to see if he's as resiliant as Carr, say what you will about his playing ability but it takes one tough dude to get that hard and that many times and still get back up and be able to play.|`|0Cpzvg2Uaa	It was a 3 year 7 million dollar contract with a 5 million dollar signing bonus. Plus it wasn't ALL his fault but he is to blame for some of the obvious passes he should of got off.(Same for all the QB's in the NFL.)|`|XPSKF2DJaa	exactly. Plus, he got 11 TD's!!! wonderful stats for a 5th year starter!!! <br>  <br>  And to look at the game film, watch him pass to Andre Johnson with all those wonderful WR SLANT plays. w00t. go short passes!<br>  <br>  about the Houston line... though they gave up 47 sacks, Rams and Bills gave up more - and yet their Qb's, Bulger and Losman, did SO much better a job than Carr.<br>  Face it, Carr is not going to ever meet his 2002 expectations.<br>  <br>  btw, Carr was signed 2 years, $6.3 mil. with $3 mil. signing bonus.

9154f5872324f4dc04da9450db7ad101aa	You should be hurt if you saw J.J. Reddick in the NBA right now.<br>  <br>  -Edit-<br>  To Dukegurl25:<br>  His game is one dimensional, he can't really keep up or stay in front of other player. Basically he's just a statue on the defensive end.<br>  I'm not saying he's a bad player or whatever, he's just a very bad defender.<br>  <br>  He logged some minutes earlier this season, that is until the coach gave up on him.|`|b8ec72ca37bd23d7b831e5cc34b48776aa	He averaged like 3 ppg last year for the orlando magic. I absolutely hate duke, but I liked Redick. I don't underestimate anyone for who they play for, but I thought he would do a little better this year.|`|AA11564290	OPAS YOU ARE TOTALLY WRONG. THE COACH OF THE MAGIC DIDNT PLAY ANY OF THE ROOKIES, NOT JUST HIM. THE COACH IS GETTING FIRED THIS YEAR AND REDICK WILL GET MORE PLAYING TIME THIS SEASON. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ABILITY. well i love jj.ive met him twice and he is the nicest person i have ever met and he gave us a bunch of stuff. dont think that the college makes the player. because then you will never get the chance to see what they are really like. he got drafted to the orlando magic 11th pick and he didnt really get the chance to play because the coach was being like a butt the whole season but when i saw him he made a halfcourt shot with 2 seconds left in the half. the coach needs to be fired. but anyway hes an amazing player and he still writes poetry.|`|HAnC9PBlaa	he is on the magic now he played like 2 min all season he is too weak for the NBA did you here about his drunk driving story ?......there are places where they randomly hold up  traffic and test each car for alcohol (they call them checkpoints) well jj was drunk so he decided nobody would realize he is drunk when he runs over a barricade and trying to get out of the line , you see a guy trying to not get tested that means he is drunk , he is a moron|`|PdRkZC4iaa	whats wrong with duke? duke is a good school and a good team, and J.J is a good player. actually i think duke trained him to be taht good. his first year in the NBA just didnt get enough playing time to prove himself. next years he will be on the starting lineup and play like a star.
vrxdsEpVaa	You really should start looking for some good treatment. I saw a program on TV about breathing technique to help asthma and many claims that it works for them.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.authentic-breathing.com/asthma.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.authentic-breathing.com/asthm...</a><br>  <br>  Many still use the inhaler but it is not a long term solution if u r playing sports.  The coach will most likely sub u out every 5 minutes or so, just to be on the safe side.|`|BDUnRVreaa	talk the team into being slow tempo. hope the team your playing isn't a fast break team. bring your inhaler. get your endurance up. sit out when you are having trouble.|`|1e13OKnOaa	I play & I have asthma but I got an inhaler & everythins goin great!|`|4a988cefe67f2c1048bbf07d0d05825aaa	My First question is if your asthma is being treated with medication?  If it is not then it will be hard for you to do the running that basketball requires. There are many medications out now that can help with exercise induced asthma, some are matinece meds like Adviar, Singulair that help keep your asthma under control and then there "rescure" inh that are to help you when you start feeling short of breath or wheezing like Albuterol and Xoponex.... you should have your parent take you to the Dr if the asthma is making it so you can't play.... Good Luck and have fun!!!|`|PApldxLLaa	ok you just ask your coach if she'll keep it with her and just during timeouts or foulshots take a puff|`|dU1GgXzZaa	Make sure you take your advair on time. I know mine has to be used about 1 1/2 hour before i play. My advice is to do conditioning on your own. The more in shape you are, the less frequent attacks will become. Also, make sure you get out of the game once you start having any trouble breathing. And if you don't already, it's good to have an inhaler that works instantly. It will make it a lot easier on you.
