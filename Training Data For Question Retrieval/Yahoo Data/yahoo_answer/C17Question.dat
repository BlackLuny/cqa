20090205192012AA7H0t5	Politics & Government;Politics	Should Obama use stimulus money for H&R Block to prepare the taxes of his cabinet?	Seeing  how none of these morons seem to be able to figure out how to pay their taxes, maybe we could take some of the trillion dollar pork bill and get 2008 tax returns filed for his cabinet.        It seems the tax code that they created and provide oversight for, is too difficult for any of them to actually complete themselves.        My 80 year old Uncle has been preparing taxes for years, it's hard to believe Obama can't find anyone smarter than the choices he's made.

20090205192103AAbFuQ3	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	My fake ID got taken and it was given to a cop. Im in OH & it has all my real info, can they do anything?	I know I know...underage drinking is very bad, blah blah blah. You were underage at one point too, so if you don't have anything nice to say then I suggest you get over it and move on to the next question.    Now what happened is a week ago, I was at the bar up the street (I have my own house, I'm a sophomore in probably the best college in OH, I have a part-time job, I'm not some screwup) Everyone I know has a fake ID who isn't 21 already. But this new bouncer at the bar decided to be a dick and take my ID (I'll admit, it was a Mclovin ID). He then gave it to a cop, while the cop was already writing up a citation for some other girl who had a fake too, soo I quickly walked away before they could do anything! It has all my real info on it, so I'm sorta scared the police could contact me. Is that possible? Can I say that someone stole my 18 ID and obviously made a fake out of it who wasn't me? A bit far fetched but it's not as if they have any proof (there aren't any cameras). Let me know what you think / the possible consequences could be of having a fake ID in Ohio

As always, I am in a classroom with the pro-democratic history teacher. I summarized that The Treaty of Versailles was overly harsh to Germany, which he accepted, but then declined the fact that the "peace built on quicksand" established by the Treaty of Versailles and the tensions along with it did not lead to a second world war. I know that Kaiser Wilhelm II, while he was insane in exile, wrote to a German General that the Jews should be exterminated, and I know that the Treaty of Versailles' overly harsh terms made hatred stir in the Germans towards the victors of World War One.      To conclude, did World War One (and its resolution with the Treaty of Versailles) have any major cause to World War Two?

20090205192454AATyfMF	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What would you do with this extreme neighbor "issue"?	Long story short. Awhile back, a neighbor kid damaged some of my property. I caught the action on my surveillance camera. Well, it happens that this kid was playing with another kid and they were both messing around with the vehicle. However, only the one kid clearly did the damage. So, I call the cops because this kind of thing has hapenned before and I didn't call cops and people never pay for damages. Well, the kid parents that did the damage seem OK however they haven't paid me. Also, it was "known" that this other kid was involved (but didn't do the damage). So, this neighbor's kid that did no damage gets just furious with me for calling the police period. I've tried to ignore it, and have given the neighbor the bill for the damage which I cut more than in half just to make it easier on them and hopefully I'd get paid something. They insisted on asking this other neighbor to help out because he claimed he would many time in his drunken rages to try to make me look bad. Well, now he calls me up and demands to "talk with me". I invite him in my house and things got ugly. He threatens my life, etc. all kinds of stuff and simply wouldn't tell me why he was mad other than that i called the cops. Needless to say I'm rattled. I couldn't believe it, but I didn't get it on tape. However, I decided to call him back and tell him I did just to get him off my back. Him and his wife are really stupid and just kept cursing at me and hung up the phone. I talked to the neighbor's mom since he wasn't home and the are now saying they also think this guy is crazy and don't know what his problem is. For a few reasons, I just don't want to fight with this guy ... but the question is do I have a choice? Thanks for any tips!

20090205193110AAbTJpF	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Wrongful Arrest ??????	ok so my sister in law got arrested the other day for shop lifting from a convenience store well actually what happened was she looked like someone that shop lifted from this store on a regular basis, and when she came in the two cashiers that were working locked her in the store and held her down.  I know this didn't seem right, so i'm pretty sure she would have a case against the store, but my next question is this.  The cashiers called the police and they arrested her and held her in jail for over 2 days without bond because the only evidence the manager of the store could come up with is a surveliance video where you can't even tell who it is on camera or that she's stealing anything.  Is it legal to hold her in jail without proof of anything?  How could they arrest her without a warrant for her arrest?  Considering she was held and later exonerated wouldn't that be wrongful ?  Could she hope to gain anything from suing them?

20090205160911AAIEUvL	Politics & Government;Elections	What do Al Gore, FDR and Obama have in common?	The New Deal didn't restore employment. In fact, there was even less work on average during the New Deal than before FDR took office. Total hours worked per adult, including government employees, were 18% below their 1929 level between 1930-32, but were 23% lower on average during the New Deal (1933-39). Private hours worked were even lower after FDR took office, averaging 27% below their 1929 level, compared to 18% lower between in 1930-32.   Even comparing hours worked at the end of 1930s to those at the beginning of FDR's presidency doesn't paint a picture of recovery. Total hours worked per adult in 1939 remained about 21% below their 1929 level, compared to a decline of 27% in 1933. And it wasn't just work that remained scarce during the New Deal. Per capita consumption did not recover at all, remaining 25% below its trend level throughout the New Deal, and per-capita nonresidential investment averaged about 60% below trend. The Great Depression clearly continued long after FDR took office.          http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12335327...

20090205193348AATfdJV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do I have a lawsuit against a Golf Course?	First case took place at a golf course where my father died of a heart attack. Roughly 3 weeks ago, my father went out to a golf course by himself and collapsed due to a heart attack on the 1st tee box. Their staff worked on him by doing CPR and using the  defibrillator. After working on him for 10-15 minutes, the ambulance arrived. The ER team then worked on him for another 15 minutes and took him away in the ambulance. Two days later, I met with the golf course manager who worked on my dad and this was the story that he told me. However, he could not provide me with specific time for each event that had incurred. I feel as if their medical assistance took too long and they should have had better licensed medical staff that may have saved my father. I do not know if the two golf course staffs that had worked on my father had medical certifications to use the defibrillator and do CPR, but I believe that my father could have been saved with quicker medical response and better procedures.

Then they conducted a post test to see if the inserted stories made people think that is an important issue.

Last month Rudd's Government handed out $10b in cash handouts as an economic stimulus.  Even if all this money had been directly spent (which it appears it hasn't) surely this just gives a boost to retail sales for 1 month and then the economy returns to its previous state.    Rudd is now looking at more handouts.  Can someone please explain how is this a good use of our money?

These are the people who Obama has decided have the judgement and the integrity to lead America during the next four years:       THE OBAMA ROGUE'S GALLERY:      Commerce Secretary: Bill Richardson - STEPPED DOWN: Currently the subject of a grand jury investigation into a state contract awarded to his political donors.      Chief Performance Officer: Nancy Killefer - STEPPED DOWN: Failed to pay employment taxes on domestic workers.       Health and Human Services Secretary: Tom Daschle - STEPPED DOWN: Failed to pay taxes on the personal use of a car and driver provided to him by a firm for which he was consulting. Also had a conflict of interest associated with speaking fees he had received from health care interests.      Treasury Secretary: Timothy Geithner - STILL AT LARGE: Failed to pay all of his taxes on income received from the International Monetary Fund in 2001 and in three subsequent years.      #2 Defense Department Official: William J. Lynn III - STILL AT LARGE: Recently lobbied for military contractor Raytheon. I guess Obama forgot about the time he said that "I don't take a dime of [lobbyist] money, and when I am president, they won't find a job in my White House."      Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services: William Corr - STILL AT LARGE: Lobbied through most of last year as an anti-tobacco advocate.      Question: If Obama was really serious about taking responsibility for having "screwed up" and embracing a new kind of politics, why are their still tax-dodgers and lobbyists in his White House? Is it possible that he is full of crap and this is just another example of more of the same?

WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - One proposal to help jump start U.S. auto sales was withdrawn late on Thursday and the fate of another was unclear, despite a vigorous endorsement from President Barack Obama, as Senate consideration of economic stimulus legislation accelerated.   Sen. Thomas Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, pulled an amendment that would have provided $16 billion in rebates to buyers of new fuel efficient vehicles who traded in their old, poor performing models.   Harkin said he would defer the so-called "cash for clunkers" proposal, which had strong support from U.S. automakers.   Lobbyists for those companies this week called it a genuine stimulus for a depressed market. U.S. auto sales plunged to a 27-year low in January.   There was no backing, however, for the plan from foreign manufacturers whose operations are clustered in states represented by conservative Republicans.

20090205194821AA9LYED	Politics & Government;Elections	Why are people continuously comparing this new administration and congress....?	to a socialistic or communist regime? Our constitution prevents any one person or party from obtaining absolute power. It's what makes our country different and unique the world over.       As a registered Independent I examine all sides of the issue and all angles of the candidate before making a choice and I feel that Pres. Obama is the right man for our country right now, even though I may not agree with him on everything I still support him, just like I supported Pres. Bush even though I did not agree with him on everything.       People need to lighten up, especially those talk radio goofballs. Their unreasonable and irrational fear of our President and Congress that they manage to feed to their listeners only serves to further divide our country in the very same way that the irrational and unfounded fear and hatred from the far left has divided our country for the past 8 years.
20090205200120AAgcSyP	Politics & Government;Politics	Is everything the fault of the "other" party -- or just all politicians?	Do you see politicians as yours and theirs?        Or do you see them as one big group?        Are all politicians rich with contacts into the industrial world with billions of dollars  or just half of them? Your half or their half?       Do you feel that you being a good party member means that your patriotic and the other half are not?       When in power does your party behave significantly different in a manner that changes society or does your life more or less stay the same no matter who is in power?       When your party is in power do the bums all get jobs and live better lives. Does crime stop does the national debt disappear does the war get won do all the charges of corruption stop ?       When the other party is in power do the bums multiply or stay about the same?       Are politicians a group onto themselves or are they divided as night and day - so much so that the nation changes over night?

I think it would be a great first step in helping Americans and all people of the world realize their true destiny to be a single people, united in a single cause - the collective betterment of the species.      The only major obstacle that we would need to face would be the selfish politicians who continue to run our currently dysfunctional parties and the scumbag "nationalists" who seem to think that arbitrary borders and bigoted notions that people who live in one geographic location are somehow better than people who live in another geographic location.  Fortunately, nobody cares what those paranoid weirdos think.

20090205195342AAJQrXC	Politics & Government;Politics	Would eliminating sports teams in school improve learning and lessen distractions?	I think, as a sub, I've concluded the sports players get preferential treatment and cause the most disruption in every classroom. It's almost a proven fact. Furthermore, many schools bias their hiring of teachers in favor of ex-jocks. Do you think that really gets the best teachers for your kids? There is also a mentality created in the schools that creates a hostility between the kids that care about their schoolwork and the athletes, who seem to be more respected and appreciated.      I don't want to eliminate sports, I just feel it should be set up more like soccer is for kids in this country, independently funded outside of school. It would save schools a lot of money and dramatically improve education.      Isn't this a great idea or what?

I don't understand why people assume Marines are better fighters, considering Army infantry combat school+ regular basic is the same as Marine infantry boot.  Is it simply the Eagle Globe and Anchor?  I mean the Army gets Strykers, Blackhawk choppers and Apache Longbows...and they're considered inferior?  Plus the infantry school is basically the same thing.  Is the whole Marines are better mentality simply propoganda?

20090205200830AA5lEBd	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What kind of lawyer would take this case?	I am a single parent of a 3 year old baby girl. i'm taking my daughters father to court for supervised visitation. heres some background...    When i found out i was pregnant, he denied her. we established paternity, by this time she was 1 years old. i let his family into her life, but he never came around. he seen her only 1 time in her life whe she was about 1 1/2 years old. recently he was put on probation for a felony, move across the country, owes back child support, and wants to be in her life. i never denied him or his family, but it was to be supervised. i was granted primary physical placement and sole legal custody a while ago, he never came to court to fight that. well now hes fighting me on supervisied visitation. he want me to fly her to where he lives now, and want 2-3 weeks in the summer. i said no, i don't want her leaving the state, and he only seen her 1 time, which was involuntary. my lawyer thinks we have a solid case to win and i talked to other attorneys. they all think i'll win as well because he doesn't have a relationship with her.     additional details about me: i am Not on state assistance, i have a full time job with health insurance..the works, and currently going to school. he nor his family who have seen her and been in her life don't help me whatsoever. i care for her on my own.    my question is this, he hired a lawyer to fight on supervisied visitation. what kind of lawyer would take a case where the father abonanded the child, and now thinks he can get her in the summer? wouldn't that lawyer know that there's a big chance they will lose, just on the fact that he never came around? i'm not stopping him from seeing her, but until i feel theres a relationship and he makes an effort to see her, i want it supervisied. he doesn't know the first thing on how to care for a 3 year old. what would their defense be with this situation?

20090205203143AA94qiR	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Is this something a police psychologist would do?	For a police cadet position, I had to visit a psychologist as one of the last stages in the whole hiring process. During the interview with the psychologist, he brought up the fact that he is going to recommend to my background officer that my history with underage drinking (which is not TOO extensive) might be an issue of impulsive behavior.       **Mind you that my past alcohol use has already been discussed with my background officer, and I have taken a polygraph, and my friends and references have been interviewed, to validate my answers. And if my drinking history was a serious issue, I wouldn't be this far in the hiring process anyway.      So, after the psychologist told me that he thinks my drinking was an issue, he sort of paused and waited for my response.       If you are a psychologist, is this a tactic that is often used to test somebody's response to an issue like this?      Do you think that the psychologist brought this up, and said that he is going to tell my background officer that it might be an issue, ONLY to see how i responded to the news (in order to test my temper)? OR, do you think he really is concerned that my drinking is indicative of impulsive behavior.

20090203071909AAuDeZI	Politics & Government;Politics	REPUBLICANS, do you really think MICHAEL STEELE, can put your party back on top once again ?	I dont think he can.  Why,  because the damage has been done.  We   see that tax cuts cannot fix and economy.  You have to put money   back in the pockets of the people, and stabalize the work force at best,   so people can spend again.  The lower gas prices will help some as   well.  The travel industry looks weak for now,  but expect that to change quickly.  And once all of the pork is cut out of this stimulus   package,  then we can go forth,  the Democrats that is.  I dont see   how Mikey is going to erase that stigma,  of the GOP being the party   of the rich,  and the racially intolerant.  Do you ?
20090205204758AAZlu5X	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are Republicans calling SPENDING to STIMULATE the economy just pork? Are they trying to destroy us?	All Republicans keep saying is tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts and any spending is labeled as pork or a liberal, big government boondoggle.      Why is any spending in their eyes just pork?  Money isn't being spent, causing demand to fall drastically which is hurting the economy every day and keeps getting worse.  We see more job reports showing job losses and record unemployment.      Spending on things like infrastructure will increase demand for goods AND create jobs - two things this economy needs.      What are Republicans' goals here?  Tax cuts alone aren't going to save the economy.  No one is going to spend the money they get from a tax cut because they are afraid; they will just save it or pay off debt, which is good for them, but not so much for stimulating the economy.       Help me to understand.

Back during the time when interracial marriage was not allowed, if a black prson and a white person were married when it was legal, and then (theoretically) the law allowing interracial marriage was overturned--would the couple still be married, as they married in good faith, with no fraud whatsoever, at a time when it was legal?    I'm working on a slightly alternate universe story, but I want it to have a basis (somewhat) on legal fact. It seems to me that the marriage should still be legal, but I'm not any sort of lawyer.

I was happy to see Obama get elected, but now I am concerned about all the headlines regarding him.  He has two basic strategies:  undo everything Bush did and do everything like Bill Clinton did.  That makes me more than a little nervous.  I was never a Clinton fan, and I certainly don′t give him personal credit for a good economy.  Presidents don′t make or break economies (not in the US political-economic system anyway).  Other than a good economy, which seems to have just been Clinton′s good luck, Clinton was not particularly impressive.      I have a question in here somewhere.  Do you think there is much more to Obama than this simple two-part strategy I mentioned?

So, there is this guy who goes to this church i go to....who is a leech         I have known him for the last year. He has worked lower-paying jobs on and off. So, he gets a check of about 800 dollars a month(he told us in the group) for "A.D.D" He was able to work those jobs though.      He is able to hold conversations and function like a normal person, has his lisence, and has been to jail two times.      He has difficulty reading. However, that really doesn't entitle you to a check. He does have the same opprotunity as everyone else. All he has to do is get his *** to a community college and take the lower level reading classes.      My JOB is to actually assist students of his intellect with lower level math classes(addition,subtraction, basic algerbra). Eventually, they end up getting there associates and a lot of time their bachlors.There ARE classes for people who have difficulty reading. MOST of these people are disabled btw.         So, how do i report this leech?      Before you democrats say "you have better opprotunities than him"      No, I really didn't. I got out of high school unable to read. I worked my *** off for two years after high school. Now, at age 21, I have a year towards a special ed degree. Oh ya, I am autistic too!

I was not... and when I found out I left her... since that time she has tried to get back with me constantly and I have said no... and then cut off all contact...       The problem is... that she keeps interfering with my relationships...       I have dated three girls... since then and all three of them have mysteriously disappeared on me... things were going well... and then poof gone... and I mean very well... no arguments... nothing...       Well I finally found out some answers from the first girl I dated... she had a single kid... the father was not in the picture and she was not getting child support... it seems that some how social services got involved in the picture behind the scenes and started to force the issue... she had never told the father of the child about her son... and so during all of the pressure and stuff she bailed on me...       Turns out the second girl that I was dating was in the same situation... her oldest child (she had two)... was from a different father... and she was not collecting child support from him and did not want him in the picture... this one I have not went back and confronted yet... but it would not suprise me if there was not a similar connection...      Finally the thrid girl told me that the childs father did know about the kid when he was born but she never pushed for child support as she did not want him in the picture as well...       She disappeared back in August... and now she is back... but has disappeared again... but I do not know the details...       Each time that these girls disappear the girl that I dated from social services calls me about two or three days later... "Just to see how I am doing"... and the last time told me in these exact words... "You really should not date anyone for a long time... you won't keep getting hurt"...       I do not know what to do... I hate to think that I brought hardship into these three ladies lives simply by dating them... and while I know a simple answer is not to date anyone else in the future that has kids or that is not getting child support is there anything that I can do...       Can Social Services take it upon themselves to go after a father that does not know he even has a child for child support... what is my recourse for action... I just want this to stop...       If the girl that I dated from Social Services is working within the legal limits of the law... then I am sitting here with my hands tied... but if she is abusing her authority or doing something illegal I want to know because I would burn myself to the ground to out her...       Thanks in advance for all your help...

But, you would also be prevented from using any of the socialist programs too.   No public education for you or your kids.   No public colleges or universities.

No use of the currency.      Every one of these programs are goverment owned and therefore socialist programs.      So would you take the offer?
20090205214337AA2TuQI	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is the Senate being pressured to get this economic stimulus legislation passed?	From the way it sounds from this portion of the article, it would seem it is a matter of life or death to get this passed ASAP.  Wouldn't you rather the Senate take their time to be sure it's what the economy needs before approving it?      "Senate struggles on stimulus in nighttime session"      WASHINGTON – In an uncertain reach across party lines, Senate moderates struggled for a compromise on economic stimulus legislation Thursday as the government spit out grim new jobless figures and President Barack Obama warned of more bad news ahead.      With partisan tensions rising, several Republican attempts to remake the bill — with higher tax cuts, lower spending and fresh relief for homeowners — failed on party-line votes.      "This is the moment for leadership that matches the great test of our time," Obama said Thursday night as the Senate plodded through a fourth day of debate on the legislation at the heart of his economic recovery plan. Earlier, he declared, "The time for talk is over. The time for action is now."       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090206/ap_o...

20090205212614AA1mhgm	Politics & Government;Politics	I think we can come up with a better rescue plan.  Who's with me?	I've looked at a bunch of the new package and it's loaded with some pretty stupid crap.  I think that we here could come up with something better and probably billions cheaper.  And unlike that idiot Peloci, I'm open to input from EVERYONE and not just Democrats!  A stimulous package is supposed to do 2 things; increase spending and create jobs.  Here are some of my ideas.    1) Cut programs that are useless.  We have too many programs that are just pointless and eating up money and resources.  One big example is the war on drugs.  Why are we caring so much what people put into their own bodies?  That should be their right to choose.  Our law enforcement groups could save valuable money and resources by not worrying about what someone is smoking in the privacy of their own home.    2) Let homosexuals marry.  Or "civil union," or whatever you want to call it.  When California legalized it, their economy exploded overnight.  Couples spent millions on wedding planners, bands, rings, homes and many other things.  The only argument against gay marriage is the religious one and that has no place in politics anyway.  Let gays get married and contribute fully to the economy.    3) Legalize Prostitution.  This goes back to the idea of why do we regulate what people do with their own bodies?  You can have sex with anyone you want for free, so why should it be illegal to pay for it?  It would get people spending money, current escorts could have clean facilities, guards, sterile medical checks, etc.  This would also create jobs.    Feel free to add your own or challenge mine.  If you challenge mine, you better have a good reason.  "It's wrong," or "it's a sin" or "it's immoral" are not good reasons.  Those are personal opinions.  If you're going to challenge me, (and I'm expecting it) bring substance to the table.    And now, add your thoughts.

20090205213346AAPdG1c	Politics & Government;Elections	Would it offend you if I told you...?	That I am white and proud of it and proud that I live in an all white rural neighborhood. Where if I accidently left my doors, windows or garage door open some night that I wouldn't have to worry about someone breaking in and my family getting raped,robbed or murdered. Or that I (and my family) can walk down my street anytime day or night without fear.  Where the kids in our schools are all white and don't have to deal with any kind of racial BS. The kind of place where you can go to enjoy sporting events at the school and there's no one there spouting MF this and MF that. Where the clientele at our stores and other business's are all white. Where we don't have to feel threatened in our place of business's or in our parking lots.       Do I love white America ? You bet I do. I love place's where it is basically crime free and very,very peaceful.    Why is it that minorities look at places like Yellowstone and don't get it and want to get back to the city as soon as possible.   While White people can look at places like Yellowstone and Mount Rushmore and get a lump in their throat.   This is a big difference in our race.      America was one super great country for white people to live in before the 1950"s.   But now it seems like certain minorities are ruining this country.        I want my country back the way it was.   Oh.. and don't kid yourself.   We'll always be the majority and will defend what is right.   Any your way of life is not right for our Beloved America.

This Porkulus Bill is straight from the Chuck Schumer cabal to enrich Zionist banksters and rob the sheeple. Same old, same old. This "stimulus package" is disgusting. Pelosi, Boxer, Schumer and cronies are outrageous. It does not make sense, just like Sen. Linsey Graham says. The Package is outrageous. It will be wasted and have no noticable affect any more than the Spring 2008 stimulus bill had for $150 billion. Wasteful, outrageous spending is not the way. Obama has made his bed too quickly on this outrage. He is getting trouble big time, real fast.       I now know he really doesn't understand a thing about macroeconomics and is taking the wrong fork in the road. Damn, that is bad news. I had hope, hoped for change. No, this is wasteful spending, again. Bush was wrong, Obama is wrong and the U.S. Congress is about to really screw up in the biggest spending binge in history. Insanity.

20090205212242AAggKWD	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can you get a criminal record in a civil case?	I did something horrible where i gave discounts to friends at my job and i was caught. The company told me that as long that i paid for the damages that i cause they will not sued or charge any criminal offense to me. Because i knew i was wrong and was afraid to get a criminal record i agree to paid the damages. They also signed a letter for me to guarantee that there will be no fine or charges against me. I paid everything and of course never step foot into their company ever again. But a month later, they send a letter from "a third party" telling me to paid yet another amount and saying that if i refuse to paid they would sued me and i will ended up paying them more if we go to court. I found this very unjust because i tried to start a new leaf in my life and than they sent a letter telling me to pay more. I already paid more than enough to them and yet they want more. I want to counterattack them for violating the agreement they gave to begin with saying as long i paid them they would not charge me. Basically i want to go into a civil case about this but im worried that when the judge found out what i did to them , the judge would give me a criminal record. Can i really get one if i bring this to court?

My little brother (not so little though, age 17) called me this afternoon and said that he stole a couple of electronic items from a retail store 3 days ago, but didn't get caught whatsoever at time & no alarms went off.  I've told him to go to the store, confess & return items, but since I live 1,000 miles away from him, I don't know if he will or not.  My question is, how often do retail stores check security cameras?  Basically, since it's been 3 days (at least as far as I know), would they go over the feeds?  Or would it have already happened by now?

I would bet the number coming out of Washington D.C. on the US economy and job market are inflated just to make the Bush Administration look good. I  Where are the jobs in America?

Whereas there are many Jewish people around the world that maintain that these attrocities are st vile and bad and have no connection to the Jewish faith or culture, and they say that Israel should not continually use its Zionist nature in comparison to that of the Jewish culture and faith and that there actions should in no way be justified as in protecting the "Jewish cause".

I agree verbally with a landscape guy who work in my neighborhood to cut down the tree in my back yard and re seed my back yard in April for 1400. He cut the tree down,. In the meanwhile he brought soil (dirt) like 2 times.At this time i paid him like 1000 for the tree as we agreed. Then he was calling me saying excuses that it was raining and he can; t work there. I understood that, but there were some days it didn't rain and he did not come and finish the back yard. He disappeard like a month. His workers came by the end of June and seeded my back yard. A really bad job. I paid the 400 to complete it.There were some places with concrete and they just put the soil on top with the seeds. ( what kind of landscape workers are they?, that they couldn't notice the concrete). Well he said now that he spent more money and the amount we owe him is now 2000. Eventhough he still not finished the yard (just 75% done) We said no. He said I will c u in court. What can I do?
