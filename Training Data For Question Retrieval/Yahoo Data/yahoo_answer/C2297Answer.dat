kNTP6HWbaa	My personal 3 health risks are second hand smoking, diet and nutrition, and chemicals in my workplace. These ever prevalent health risks correlate accordingly with the cancer risk table that was presented to me. It appears that every day things such as second hand smoking and chemicals in the workplace are major causes of cancer and other dangerous health conditions. Less than adequate nutrition and eating habits can also contribute to bad health and a greater chance of dying of cancer.|`|cf1G1lSeaa	/\ /\  \/ \/    ****|`|icRwgQ7waa	I would assume the teacher wants you to take your risks (second hand smoke, nutrition and workplace chemicals) and try to apply them and interpret them given the table he gave you for mortality. Not knowing what is in the table, I would have to guess but for instance, it might say that females who are exposed to 2nd hand smoke for 10 years have an average life expectancy of 75, for those w/ exposure to workplace chemicals 65-90, etc. and then I guess I would say that if all risks were equal and continued for the rest of your life, your life expectancy would be (whatever the average of the numbers is). Hope that helps.|`|HfVNh4baaa	they are different because you choose what goes in your body for diet and you don't for the 2nd hand smoke and chemicals. you are merely exposed to them because they are in your environment.  also nutrition can be a positive thing for you, increasing your life span, but there is no way 2nd hand smoke and chemicals can be good for you.    they are similar because they are all negatively impacting you at the moment. they are also similar because you can change them if you try. eat better, get a different job, and stop hanging out with smokers. good luck. :)|`|gpON465Iaa	I would only make fun so I do not want to answer.

A good variation of the first one that would be a lot less disgusting would be to put said pickles in boxes marked "Gift From the Administration" in every teacher's mailbox. The principal and teachers would be really confused as to where they came from and what they were supposed to do with a box of pickles.|`|1BHM6z8faa	Im going to be a senior two years from now and im planning ahead on a senior prank    Im either going to scatter pickles all over the school so that over the summer they get fuzzy,rotten and they stink up the whole school over the summer  -This wont work, they have a janitor come to most schools even during summer once a week.    Smear poo on all the boys bathroom walls  -This is to middle school    Release mice in the school  -Eh...to easy    Try to sell my school in the newspaper  -This one is pretty good actually    Mine-  Okay so if you have a pool in your school have every single senior jump in it during like a passing period and play in there for a little while...then go back to class completly drenched.
jU7jNaixaa	First off, I would entitle the piece "Neel". Next, because this is an assignment, I would remove the first part of the first sentence. It's already obvious. This leaves something like: "My eight-year-old brother, Neel, is in Grade 2 at XX school."    I tend to have a very conversational tone when describing something, so I would tend to continue (in the same paragraph) in a sort of thinking-out-loud kind of monologue. "How would I describe him? Well, I don't think it's easy to describe someone you live with. They are just always there; part of the background. But having looked at him as an individual for this project, this is what I see." You can play with this -- so that it is truly your 'voice'. The teacher will know if it isn't your words. Trust me on this.     Then, the next paragraph would be devoted to the physical description, as you have done, starting with "Neel has medium length black hair", and continue from there. I would, however, add to the last sentence .. "he sort of has a girly voice -- like a lot of boys his age." It's less insulting to him as a person. Also, I thought Philipino was spelled with an F -- Filipino. Check that. It doesn't make sense but, who said it had to?    Having started the previous paragraph with his name, you might want to use the phrase 'My brother' for this one -- for variety. "My brother can be a great person to hang out with", and continue from there. By having started a new paragraph, we already know that we've moved from the physical description to something else. When you say "Now about his personality", it sounds like you've been given the assignment to do in two paragraphs.     The only real problem I see is in the sentence, "Hes reluctant to do homework and his priorities, but with enough talking to, hell eventually do it." I think there may be a word missing around the homework / priorities phrase.    Some other questions that arise: Does he like any sports -- either to play or to watch? Favourite teams? Does he have any favourite foods (or hated foods) or articles of clothing? Favourite colour, maybe?     These are just some ideas to fill out the assignment -- and they are all things that you know about him, but no one else does.     Write for the person who knows nothing about him.    Hope this helps.

AUkuRqP9aa	A response to "pacomanandeotw" reply: "...It was my first choice because it's actually tougher than Stuy and the kids there are smarter. I was up for the challenge so I put Bronx first! And I got in without studying! Good luck! Oh, and by the way, stuy isn't really that great. People say it's the best out of the 8 but it's not. The cut-off's higher just because they have a newer building and they don't even offer honors classes which isn't really that appealing to colleges. Congratulations!"    Stuy has no honor's classes? Are you out of your mind? Stuy has the most AP courses and elective options of any New York City high school. Stuy has more graduates accepted into Ivy League and prestigious universities than Bronx Science does, and perhaps Brooklyn Tech combined. The majority of Bronx Science students go to Bronx Science (which I do respect as a good high school) because they couldn't make it into Stuy; eighth graders cry out of disappointment and sorrow because they got into BxSci and not Stuy. You, as a future Bronx Science student, are going to be a disgrace to Bronx Science if you continue spreading your ignorance on-line. Check your facts before you post them next time.    To eighth graders: Consider the type of person you are before making your decision to go a specialized high school. Are you already an achiever in middle school, or are you middle of the class that got lucky on the SHSAT? Stuyvesant (and I can probably assume the same for the majority of specialized high schools) isn't really that worth going to. The competition is cut-throat and the workload is intense. I'm not trying to discourage you from going to a great school, but do you think you have a chance of being top of the class at a specialized high school? If not, you'll be one of those mediocre (by mediocre I mean low 90 average; only about 30-50 students per grade get above 95 in Stuy w/ a real shot at a prominent college; if you can't make 90, as most in Stuy cannot, then you have almost no chance) students in a specialized h.s. who suffer for 4 years and end up going to a local college, or less than prestigious one. Only the top 50 or so students really make it to the prominent colleges. So think deeply about how you want your next 4 years to be. It can be really hard with a really high chance of being outperformed (specialized h.s.) or it can be really easy and you'll probably graduate top of your class with a good shot at a good college (nonspecialized h.s.).    Extra things you might want to consider: Chances are you will wake up at 6AM and commute for at least an hour, standing. Homework takes forever, especially when piled on top of extra-curriculars. The majority of good students (94+) stay up really late, past 12AM, sometimes to 2 or 3, and some don't sleep. Those who sleep at 10PM and wake up at 7-8AM have it too good and chances are they have a low 80 average.  A good 50% of the teachers are either foreign (with an incomprehensible accent) or incompetent. It usually comes down to heavy textbook studying and cramming to get over a 90 on exams.|`|BXmWcKOoaa	Only if you meet all these requirements. If you complete the summer school, then you can go to one of the specialized high schools.    The students must:    1) Have scored close to the admission cut-off score on the SHSAT; and    2) Be certified as disadvantaged by their middle school according to any one of the following criteria:    a. attend a Title 1 school and be from a family whose total income is documented as meeting federal income eligibility guidelines established for school food services by the NYS Department of Agriculture; or  b. be receiving assistance from the Human Resources Administration; or  c. be a member of a family whose income is documented as being equivalent to or below Department of Social Services standards; or  d. be a foster child or ward of the state; or  e. initially have entered the United States within the last four years and live in a home in which the language customarily spoken is not English; and    3) Be recommended by their local school as having high potential for the special high school program.      Hope this helps! ?|`|t4agVXSEaa	idk but today i got my shsat results and got in to Bronx Science with a 519|`|k3zYSdqaaa	i got a 495 and got into tech so im guessing ur pretty close|`|bOJtMSPpaa	Maybe cuz my friend didnt get into anywhere with a 470 and he was eligible for Discovery.

I think it adds about 10-15 points extra. I just found out I'm on Bronx Science and I'm really happy! It was my first choice because it's actually tougher than Stuy and the kids there are smarter. I was up for the challenge so I put Bronx first! And I got in without studying! Good luck! Oh, and by the way, stuy isn't really that great. People say it's the best out of the 8 but it's not.

Congratulations!|`|gmlpESP9aa	What ImmortalIX writes is entirely correct. Though you guys are young and are only looking ahead to high school, we all now what it's about. Money. How do you get it? A good college. A degree. Etc. Nobody at a self-respecting business or corporation outside of NYC actually knows what Stuyvesant, BrxSci or Brooklyn Tech are. What you need to worry about is beasting in high school and awing colleges with your extra-currics, grades, recommendations, etc. The prominence of a high school means nothing.         However, if it's NOT all about money, and you just wanna learn, Specialized High schools are great. Lots of dumb people there, but lots of intellectual, funny, smart people. They can help you learn and appreciate knowledge. And if you work hard enough, BOOM great colleges will be at your feet. It's just harder to do at Stuy than at your local zone school.  Good Luck!

zgTsCicNaa	Malcolm Graeme, a young knight loyal to the King.    The narrative of the poem concerns the struggle between King James V and the powerful clan Douglas. The King has banished the entire family from his realm, including James of Douglas, the Earl of Bothwell, who had been his protector during his youth. The Earl and his daughter Ellen take refuge with Roderick Dhu in his castle on an island in Loch Katrine. At the beginning of the poem a mysterious knight calling himself James Fitz-James arrives at the castle and is granted hospitality. During his brief stay, he falls in love with Ellen but finds rivals for her affections in Roderick himself and in Malcolm Graeme, a young knight loyal to the King but moved by sympathy at the plight of Douglases. It is Malcolm that Ellen favours. Facing attack from royal forces for sheltering Douglas, Roderick gathers his clan. Douglas, though, is loath to bring disaster upon his host, and sets out for the royal court at Stirling, determined to surrender. Fitz-James returns and offers to take Ellen to safety but is told that she loves another. He nonetheless presses on her a ring which, he says, will obtain any favour from the King. Travelling to Stirling, Fitz-James meets and quarrels with Roderick. In the ensuing fight, Roderick is mortally wounded and carried to Stirling as a captive. Ellen presents herself at court and, showing the ring, pleads for her father's pardon. She discovers that Fitz-James is no other than the King himself. The King and Douglas are reconciled through her intervention, and Ellen and Malcolm marry.     ?

Unless you can prove that you LEGALLY need that passed note or cell phone to function during the eight hours you're at school, then asking if there's a law against taking it seems kind of silly.    That being said, if the teacher does not return a student's property by the end of the day, visit the principal and ask about it.

VxtSO8BGaa	"Hi"......Don't go by me but where is the "consideration" ?    I always thought there were 3 parts to a contract ,written or verbal and namely...    Offer....an offer to sell the album    Acceptance....agree to buy the album    Consideration...an exchange of funds either a down payment or whatever and a receipt issued !    I realize the "Performance" can't be done because there is no Album......but I also think that the contract is null and void because of no "Consideration"! Even a dollar down would have made the contract valid.    It seems that the buyer was more informed as to the real value of the album thanthe seller was and the seller's motivation was diminished in that he had no funds from the buyer! If I were the buyer and was duping the seller and he was ,and make no mistake about that ,then I would have been more prudent and ensured that "Consideration" was done so that there would have been no problem with sueing for "Specific Performance"!    I mean I could be wrong but it's just my opinion ! *S* (Michael C...)|`|2sXqm4u9aa	Well, from what I can tell Mr. A did not have capacity to enter into an agreement verbally or by written contract as he did not own the album in the first place.  You cannot sale property that belongs to someone else.  If Mr. B wants to enforce a oral contract against Mr. A thinking he will get a $5,000.00 whitecoveruk for $20.00.  Mr. B. needs to find himself another lawyer as he is knowingly commiting larceny with is a felony thereby making whatever contract he made null and void.  Besides if only 10 uk albums were released and the royal family has them then the expert record collecter would know this.  As far as I can tell neither one of them had the capacity to enter into this agreement as one did not own it and the other was thinking he could scam him out of a expensive album for nothing.  I don't think an oral agreement with these facts are legal.  I don't think they had a contract at all.  Whatever state you are in look up what constitutes a contract.  Enter in state of  where you are and see if this agreement meets the requirements.  I'm pretty sure any judge that heard this would throw them both out of court and dismiss the case
uKE7FNAcaa	I think that if you are "lazy, careless, and free," and not too shocked or saddened by an F on your report card, it might not be wise to stay in honors.It would be better for you to do well in an 'easy' class as opposed to failing an advanced class. It is good to have a challenge, but I think that your current challenge to overcome is is your grade in the class. I believe that your "potential" is to be in an honors class, but you should wait until you are able to handle your grades. Your life took a hard turn in sixth grade, causing your grades to drop. Taking a non-honors class will allow you to get your grades up to where they used to be.

xpiGWrdMaa	You teachers blame it on the girls wearing revealing clothing. Shame on you. Learn to control your sexual urges when you're teaching kids. Is that too difficult for some of you to do?  You are the adult, practice some self control.
xi9amEG2aa	How is he still a teacher there?  Threatening kids like that isn't a good thing.  Neither is throwing stuff, that breaks glass!  He doesn't sound like he's at the right job.  Either that or he needs some anger management or something like that.  Tell your principal about his knife threats, and anything else violent he's done.  He could end up hurting somebody one day.      See if you can get that break down of all your grades from that semester or quarter or whatever...then have your Guidance Counselor make sure they add up right.    Good luck!|`|pQhMQnRgaa	Tell your principle.

Also, if you and your lab partner are turning in the exact same work and what not. Maybe ask and see if they are willing to get a print out of their grades, and you get a print out of yours to compare.     I went through something similar with my biology teacher, so my lab partner and I start turning in everything at the same time, with the exact same answers, and kept everything that was handed back. Then when grades came out and mine were lower than hers, we went through everything and talked to the counselor. After having the evidence to back it up, she had no choice but to adjust my grades.|`|RcL7HhLKaa	It is really hard to see your story when you have a series of events.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	If your teacher is pulling knives on kids threatening them with violence those threats should not be taken lightly, even if he would never act on them.

Agad3Oc4aa	well if you live in the nyc area you can call ACS and apply for help.  They will go by your income.  So only take one set of paystubs if its a two parent household.  However, your child has to be at least 2 or 2 1/2 to go to a daycare center.  Under that age it's usually home care by a home provider.  If you don't qualify for the voucher you can call a city run day care and it may cost you about $150 a week for 2 year olds and over.      Child Care Inc.   Child Care Inc. is one of the five agencies that are members of the NYC Child Care Resource and Referral Consortium. Each can refer you to day care services in New York City.       322 8th Avenue   New York, NY     Monday through Friday, 9 am to 5 pm  (212) 929-7604        However, you can also try to apply for a voucher for a private daycare but they are extremely hard to get and have a long waiting list. Also if you cannot get through to make an appt try walking in.  I have provided the numbers below.

Stop bitching and do your work.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	Bad grammar + bad marks = bad student|`|9pOsLqSzaa	First off, your math teacher doesn't hate you. If there's a mistake in the system, go to your teacher and have him or her change it. How could that be the student's fault? They can't hold you back if it's a grading mistake. If you have the assignment or test with the A+ grade on it as proof, or if your teacher still has it, they have to change it in the system.|`|CfRQYKEyaa	Talk to your teacher about the changes. There is a chance that there could be a mistake in the system. Or that he put the wrong grades in. If you did get the bad grades, you need to own up to them, and ask the teacher if you can make them up or do extra credit. If all else fails, and you do get held back, then you will have to do better next time and try as had as you can. If you did get unwarrented bad grades, then I feel for you, because the same thing happened to me in an English class in high school. I found my graded papers in her trash can when she said I didn't turn them in. Also she gave me lower grades on my essays and short stories, even after my mother helped me and I had no spelling or grammical errors.|`|hc89tLJcaa	If you make as many errors in math as you did in your question above, then you have EARNED those bad grades.

72c95bac249f1ad6b0d93f887b2c50c2aa	Hi,  At this age, all the people are having similar to your doubts.   First of all you analyse your power and interest on which you show more interest.  If you wanted to take medical there are three things involved. Your percentage of marks in the SSLC and you can take science in PUC Or in +2.  Secondly you should have either money power or your father or mother should have been in this profession. Otherwise it is very difficult to establish you in the medical line. In the long run Medical line will fetch you more money but not in the initial stage but at later stage that too if you are prefessional in the some specific specialisation. If you are not a specialist in any kind of medical line it may not go monetary, because there are lakhs of Doctors are available in and around.   As per the current trend you may go for Civil Engineering since there may not be any derth for this line and the second if you interested you can opt of CA. If you want to take CA, go for mathemetics in +2 level and take the B.com. After passing your 1year B.com, you may enroll for CA Inter and if you concentrate well by the time of your completing B.com., you can complete your Inter CA and within one or two year you may complete Final CA. This is a very good line..... since any company will take with a good salary.    - thanks - ramani -|`|yqWlt0Q7aa	English?|`|RWXZuDhXaa	Just do what you feel is right|`|NrBjt3v3aa	if u feel u can afford to (or rather can have the patience to study, mug up and vomit ) all that stuff in biology, and still u r interested, then go for biology.... u can switch lines later if u don't want to do ur grad in medical...  else choose any other sub..|`|lZa9R7IFaa	Well, you have plenty of options -    ARTS - about literature, history, legal (law) etc., - you need to be good in languages, comfortable with remembering dates etc., as history and legal stuff has many dates and Acts etc., to remember.    COMMERCE - about accounting - you need to be good in simple calculations - (Maths is optional, but opting for Maths will make you eligible for higher studies like - CA, ICWA etc.,)    SCIENCE - is about applied and pure science (applied = engineering, pure = theoretical). While you need to be good in science and maths for pure science (B.Sc), you need to be really excellent in them for engineering (B.E. / B.Tech)    a brief on commerce, engineering and other fields are given in the following link -    http://genwis.com/    Other option is MBBS after 12th.    COMPUTERS (IT) - is about computer software application, all about making software programs - after 12th you can pursue BCA or B.Sc in computer science.    ----------------  Alternate Options:-    If you have some creative talent like drawing, writing etc., after 12th (any stream) you can do Mass Media & Communication - you can choose either Journalism or Advertisement / TV&Media / PR / Event management etc.,    OR, if you like computers, and are good in drawing, you can do B.Sc in Animation after 12th (any stream)....its has great scope, as most of the big animation industries of the world are getting job done from us.    all the best !!!!
AA11251285	Of course you can be a Teacher.  Heck, many teachers today are on anti-depressants.  It may be against the law for a school to ask you about your mental health, but if you really wanted to get a good answer to this, I suggest you call a school system's Human Resources department (Don't use your real name) and ask them if depression is checked before they hire someone.|`|AA12178390	I can't say for every state but I think for most states the answer is no, they do not do a mental health background check.    They do a criminal background check, and as long as your mental health has never lead you to a run in with the law they won't know about it unless you bring it up.    I know many teachers who have had mental health problems to some degree.     Let's face it, you have to be a little crazy to want to teach anyway.
xpiGWrdMaa	Clearly, that is not fair. Get some students together to complain to the principal.  Also the parents.

hgTR8Uzaaa	No, they are supposed to be alone for extended periods of time.  That is the point.  Hopefully your "real" teacher is checking up on him/her after school and is aware of lesson plans and activities that are going on in the classroom.  Ultimately, you're original teacher is responsible for what goes on in the classroom.  If something dangerous is going on, then you might take the initiative and tell your teacher yourself.      But your student teacher needs to learn how to teach because next year he/she will be all alone all the time.  Try to be understanding.  A lot of teaching is trial and error.|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	When I was a student teacher I was alone with class all the time.|`|HEvSVMeVaa	They are supposed to teach alone for a certain amount of time, depending on their teacher, state and school.

It eventually comes in handy.|`|lCtl1L3kaa	They probably read it at home like normal people do.  When they're done, they bring it in so that maybe you'll be interested in reading it too.|`|HEvSVMeVaa	They have great articles and pictures.

TaZvxS7Saa	If your teacher's telling you that, maybe it's time for switching classes. Taking "regular" history isn't really a big drop from taking AP-- the material is the same (think about it... do AP classes change what you know about history that much?... No), it's just probably taught at a faster pace.    As for taking so many AP classes... think about it twice. Junior year is said to be the hardest year, so you might want to balance it out.|`|IsozKRNeaa	Passing regular US History will look better than failing AP US History. I would switch out if I were you.
RNx4ZZIVaa	I cannot imagine why someone with a transfer degree cannot get into a 4 year university with that gpa.     Is your transfer degree focused in any specific discipline or is just general requirements?     Because I don't what schools you applied to I cannot say for sure why you are getting rejected. You could be getting rejected because the schools you applied to cannot see any proof in your community college transcripts that you are focused in any one discipline. (OR It could also be lack of community involvement, a weak admission essay, or even what school activities you were in.)    This does not mean that you need to go to community college another year. Just take a few more classes related to whatever you plan on majoring in at the universities you applied to. Once you've done that  apply again to the schools that rejected you.    Good luck!|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	i think you can transfer after an year btw im only 14 but my sis is going to a sommunity college thats why i know

Well, this is the end of a perfect day,  Near the end of a journey too;  But it leaves a thought that is big and strong,  With a wish that is kind and true.

9Ijv5Mppaa	Actually it's a better idea to take an AP class unrelated to your major, as crazy as it sounds. See, if you took an AP communications-type class and you pass the test, your college will likely not give you college credit towards your major. Instead, it will give you those credits as elective credits. But with AP Chemistry, passing the test will probably get you out of taking a science in college.|`|35c3df911f84beff6b1fc6dff3df6190aa	You might need it in the long, like for a science elective.|`|a36a4f0aa2d7f129af1802cbaa36ec85aa	If you know that you are not majoring in a science field, why would you even consider taking AP Chemistry? Why not AP History or AP English? Do you have a secret interest in science? If so, high school is the time to explore it. I would only consider AP Chemistry if you have already taken and done well in prior science courses. Otherwise, play it safe with your GPA and your transcripts and take a class more related to your ultimate goals that you know you could do well in and that you might enjoy.  Hope that helps!|`|eMV9qrLnaa	Well it really depends on what you think your going to get. since its not a prerequisite, its not needed but it could be counted towards your top 6 marks which get looked at by universities/colleges.    if its not going to be a good mark then i dont suggest u take it. you honestly only need to take AP if your university suggests it.|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	yes its totally worth it
4flomCyJaa	Depends on where you want to go to college - some colleges require that students with majors outside of the sciences take a science course. If you can ace the AP exam, you could exempt a college course. My advice is if at least one of the top 3 colleges you want to attend accepts AP credit, take AP Chem; if not, it's not really worth the pain of studying for the exam.

I don't think so, because to be able to get the salt out, it would need to be boiled, which would use more energy than just drinking it.

Xh3Q8jqXaa	As long as you have a bachelor's degree and the required certification to be an educator/teacher, then the age doesn't matter.|`|y6QtbuHMaa	as lomg as you have your degrreee then yeah,    think of it as an opprotunity, you can relate easier.|`|HK30PzNraa	As long as you have your certificate you are fine!Congratulations and GOD bless|`|UpAssrwHaa	I've heard of professors teaching classes at 24, not sure when they started, probably younger.|`|6EOcwRkAaa	Your age won't matter as long as you have a Bachelor's Degree. You will need to make an extra effort to dress and act professionally.     In regards to whether you should continue on to get your Master's-do check in your area - my experience has been the opposite of Chelsea's.  Due to lack of funding, administrators are looking to hire teachers who fill the minimum requirement because they can't afford to pay for more experience or education.  They also tend to let teachers go after the 3rd year (before tenure) so the school system will not be locked into another escalating salary.  The very strong advice given around here is don't even mention getting your Master's until you have tenure. Once you are tenured, then get your Master's and Master's +30 as quickly as you can so that your salary increases and is also calculated into your retirement.  Unfortunately, money is always the bottom line- especially now.     Good luck- I too, knew I wanted to be a teacher since very young.  It is the most wonderful job if you can keep your priorities in focus.|`|u1rnvyxJaa	To be a teacher ur legally old enough at 18. But like you said you might be to young but if you have your bachelors degree and your 21 you should be fine. I have this health teacher whose 20 and he works at my school.  You should be fine!!|`|JBqjLvmdaa	That's not too young, however they always pick people with Master's and Doctorate degrees first.  The more experience in the field, the more they want you.  It's a very good idea to get your Master's degree, as most high schools really encourage that degree.  Most people that apply to become a high school teacher achieve the next level of degree.  Yet, you could apply for a job in demand (maybe something in the elementary department or foreign language, whatever is in demand when you graduate) and work your way up to the position you want.  The school you work for at that time may even help pay for you to get your Master's.|`|IMeHKA3uaa	21 is old enough to be a teacher, even in high school but there's no guarantee that the students will listen to you or give you the respect a teacher should have; they may not see you are a teacher but one of them (not always a good thing)|`|WJjfrf0Caa	you just have to have a teacher certificate. 21 is plenty old.

yCjJJIStaa	Spanish and Chinese are often the most useful professionally - where I live, there are always job listings seeking people who are fluent in these languages, from entry-level jobs on up to professional jobs. The other languages would mainly be of use to you if you were planning to go to graduate school in a humanities subject.  Latin can be helpful with medical terminology, but probably not so much that it would tip the balance in its favor.    German and Latin have the most complicated grammar, although it's really just that they have a lot of rules, not rules riddled with exceptions like English, so they're not really all that hard.  Chinese has easy grammar but it's hard to get used to all the characters and tones.  French and Spanish are about the same grammar-wise, but Spanish is easier to pronounce.    I'd say just go with what sounds the most interesting and fun to you right now - that will help keep you motivated.  Is there anywhere you'd really like to travel?  A particular culture that appeals to you?  A language you just like the sound of?  Don't worry, they're all great choices.|`|phH2dVYZaa	Where do you live? In America, then Spanish    Or else Latin. Latin is very interesting and it's a basic component of many languages so you might understand others too. So Latin I'd pick. Personally, I have no choice, I have to do Italian or nothing.|`|7tiH0gREaa	I'm taking Spanish right now and like it. I've been taking it for 4 years and I still have 2 more to go. I really want to be fluent.    I've always thought it would be cool to take Latin. It'd be very interesting. If I have to take a language in college, that's what I'm going to take.|`|ff9kxHHqaa	spanish i took it and it was easy.|`|8rCjpGDfaa	All those languages are great choices, but it is all up to you.  Mandarin is of course the hardest of these languages, while Spanish is the easiest.  I took both Spanish and French and I had a great time taking both.  Personally, I find Spanish to be a lot easier than French since it does not have as many rules on grammar, punctuation,etc.  Latin, on the other hand, is also pretty easy but it can get confusing.  German lastly is also easy, but pronouncing the words are pretty hard.  German also has some letters and accents that are not found in French or Spanish.|`|AA11573437	You should take Latin. It will help you the most for SAT vocabulary and also if you want to learn other romance languages as they stem from latin. My high school doesn't offer Latin or else I would have taken it. Good luck!!!|`|qE49jbVaaa	french easiest langauge EVER!!!!!!   i took it easy and it is the most like english go steelers|`|N5jQuNCRaa	Wow, thats a large variety of languages. I am actually starting highschool next year to. You are really lucky to have all those languages to choose from.     This is just my opinion but I wouldn't take French, German , or Latin. I think Mandarin Chinese is pretty cool but Spanish is fun to. I think you should take Spanish, because spanish is spoken in quite a few places more than mandarin chinese and also I just love how it sounds.     The other languages are just as beautiful sounding although I had to take French in elementry and middle school, I got very tired of it. I wanted to learn something new. I have always wanted to take spanish but in the highschool that i'm attending next year doesnt apply spanish.    This is your decision.. REMEMBER THAT! Take whatever you feel comfortable with, good luck! |`|7DX7XsbUaa	I'm taking French this year. My school only offered Latin, French, and Spanish, and I've always been fascinated by the French language so that's what I took. I think, though, that I might've braved Chinese, had I been offered that choice. It's a personal choice, and I'm sure you can change it after freshman year if you didn't like whatever you chose. I'd say try Chinese. That'd be really cool to learn.|`|deOxABCGaa	I think German is the best option because no one actually speaks latin now and Chinese is a very hard language to learn, I can speak it but after three years I still don't know how to write it as a lot of it requires a good memory because its nothing like english.|`|HHzjzq4Zaa	I ll rate them on MY opinion    1.Spanish  2.Mandarin Chinese  3.German  4.Latin  5.French  wow ur lucky in my skool we onli get to choose between urdu and french|`|QkmoNX2Qaa	Depends if you like a challenge.  I take french. Mainly because I just was attracted to it more and liked the culture.  Spanish and french are pretty easy. Although spanish is the easiest language to learn.  But if you learn say, spanish or french or italian it's really easy to learn other european languages coz they are very similar. Not too sure bout german though.  Chinese is pretty useful, but hard. If you think your up to the challenge for chinese, then go for it!   Otherwise stick with french or spanish.  Latin is pretty useful, it sorta broadens your mind. But no one really uses it anymore.  Goodluck (Choose whatever you are more attracted to learning, what culture u like the most? Or what you think will help you the host.)  Bonne chance!  (Goodluck in french XD)|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	Hey! We're the same age. =]    I'm going to take Spanish; it's the easiest and most used besides Mandarin.    I'm Chinese anyway so if I took that it'd be a big waste of time...  I don't see the point of learning Latin, and German is freaking complicated and hard.    My advice is to either take French or Spanish; Chinese is really hard if haven't been born into it [trust me, my friends have COMPLAINED and COMPLAINED].    French is a beautiful language, but you're unlikely to use it after you graduate. Chinese and Spanish are the best bets for more frequent use, but Chinese is way harder.    So that narrows it down to Spanish...which I shall be taking..yeah.|`|1mKJFfieaa	Hmmm...    For the easier one would choose Spanish and French...    But I would want to take Mandarin Chinese that sounds cool....    But ultimately the decision is yours    Good Luck!!

lzEuuseJaa	Can you call and ask what your chances would be on the wait-list? Of course, they cannot tell you what will happen, but they can give you an idea of what has happened in the past. It's no guarantee, but if they tell you that they only let in one person off of the wait-list every year for the past 5 years, it will make your decision easier.    What a dilemma! I wouldn't give up a place at Stuy unless I felt very sure I had a very good chance at getting into my first choice. Especially if the option would be a not so good high school.     When do you have to make decisions by? Will you know about the private school by then?  We find out in LA the first week in March about private school admissions.    Good luck!
C4WlEbIOaa	Honestly, it depends on the school.  Harvard, Yale, Stanford-- schools of that caliber want great SAT Scores with super GPA's.  Other schools like Boston University, George Washington University, some of the UC schools in CA will over look a slightly weak GPA if the SAT score is high, or a weak SAT score if a GPA is high. Usually, (I have heard this from a few different University cllr. including GWU) they prefer a higher GPA because it represents what you have done in the last four years.      Hope that helped :)|`|6740cce5db21709e63b8aa09900b506baa	I think you should retake the SAT.  A 2000 is decent, but your GPA looks incredible.   Your high gpa should balance out your grades, but GPA and test scores aren't the only thing that colleges look for...honestly just do you your best and go to a school that is best FOR YOU.|`|9Ijv5Mppaa	GPA is kind of arbitrary and meaningless. Class rank is wayyy more important and equal to test scores when it comes to college admissions.

2Eaga0ywaa	McCrae was born in McCrae House in Guelph, Ontario, the grandson of Scottish immigrants. He attended the Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute and became a member of the Guelph militia regiment.    McCrae worked on his B.A. at the University of Toronto in 189293. He took a year off his studies at the university due to recurring problems with asthma.    He was a member of the Toronto militia, The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, while studying at the University of Toronto, during which time he was promoted to Captain and commanded the company.    Among his papers in the John McCrae House in Guelph is a letter McCrae wrote on July 18, 1893 to Laura Kains while he trained as an artilleryman at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. "...I have a manservant .. Quite a nobby place it is, in fact .. My windows look right out across the bay, and are just near the waters edge; there is a good deal of shipping at present in the port; and the river looks very pretty."    He was a resident master in English and Mathematics in 1894 at the OAC in Guelph.    He returned to the University of Toronto and completed his B.A. McCrae later studied medicine on a scholarship at the University of Toronto. While attending the university he joined the Zeta Psi Fraternity (Theta Xi chapter; class of 1894) and published his first poems.    While in medical school, he tutored other students to help pay his tuition. Two of his students were among the first women doctors in Ontario.    He completed a medical residency at the Robert Garrett Hospital, a children's convalescent home in Baltimore, Maryland.    In 1902, he was appointed resident pathologist at Montreal General Hospital and later also became assistant pathologist to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. In 1904, he was appointed an associate in medicine at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Later that year, he went to England where he studied for several months and became a member of the Royal College of Physicians.    In 1905, he set up his own practice although he continued to work and lecture at several hospitals. He was appointed pathologist to the Montreal Foundling and Baby Hospital in 1905. In 1908, he was appointed physician to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Infectious Diseases.       John McCrae in 1912In 1910, he accompanied Lord Grey, the Governor General of Canada, on a canoe trip to Hudson Bay to serve as expedition physician.    McCrae served in the artillery during the Second Boer War, and upon his return was appointed professor of pathology at the University of Vermont, where he taught until 1911; he also taught at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.    When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany at the start of World War I, Canada, as a Dominion within the British Empire, declared war as well. McCrae was appointed as a field surgeon in the Canadian artillery and was in charge of a field hospital during the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915. McCrae's friend and former student, Lt. Alexis Helmer, was killed in the battle, and his burial inspired the poem, In Flanders Fields, which was written on May 3, 1915 and first published in the magazine Punch.    From June 1, 1915 McCrae was ordered away from the artillery to set up No. 3 Canadian General Hospital at Dannes-Camiers near Boulogne-sur-Mer, northern France. C.L.C. Allinson reported that McCrae "most unmilitarily told [me] what he thought of being transferred to the medicals and being pulled away from his beloved guns. His last words to me were: 'Allinson, all the goddam doctors in the world will not win this bloody war: what we need is more and more fighting men.'"    'In Flanders Fields' appeared anonymously in Punch on December 8, 1915, but in the index to that year McCrae was named as the author. The verses swiftly became one of the most popular poems of the war, used in countless fund-raising campaigns and frequently translated (a Latin version begins In agro belgico...). 'In Flanders Fields' was also extensively printed in the United States, which was contemplating joining the war, alongside a 'reply' by R. W. Lillard, ("...Fear not that you have died for naught, / The torch ye threw to us we caught...").    For eight months the hospital operated in Durbar tents (donated by the Begum of Bhopal and shipped from India), but after suffering storms, floods and frosts it was moved in February 1916 into the old Jesuit College in Boulogne-sur-Mer.    McCrae, now "a household name, albeit a frequently misspelt one",regarded his sudden fame with some amusement, wishing that "they would get to printing 'In F.F.' correctly: it never is nowadays"; but (writes his biographer) "he was satisfied if the poem enabled men to see where their duty lay."    On January 28, 1918, while still commanding No 3 Canadian General Hospital (McGill) at Boulogne, McCrae died of pneumonia. He was buried with full honours  in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission section of Wimereux Cemetery, just a couple of kilo|`|KBCFVZVNaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCrae|`|G5nSzRJqaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCrae|`|NS3BxXEmaa	I will say do not go or trust wiki people can just go and change it thats all i can do for u

Jr6emga0aa	There are several ways in which you can fool yourself, both negatively and positively. The negative ways are where you get yourself to believe in something wrong that is bad for you or for others ( e.g. a belief that drugs or smoking can't hurt or that cheating is "OK" ).     However, there are positive ways in which you get yourself to believe that you can defy the odds in an athletic contest. I always appreciated the exhortation the US Hockey coach gave his team in the 1980 Olympics when they had to face the strongest hockey team in the world at the time, the Russians. He told them, "They will beat you nine out of every ten nights because they're so strong but NOT TONIGHT." They rose to the occasion and beat the odds.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	Religion is an elaborate way for people to fool themselves.  I'd go that route, there's no shortage of options when that's your subject.

We talk about all the presidents, and controversies and wars involved in their presidency.

If your school has zero tolerance for violence you would get at least one day. Someone will turn you in eventually, so it's your best bet to talk to your counselor and ask him/her to meet with you and the principal.  Maybe they will turn it into in-school suspension. Good luck.|`|ZZ1RbxuKaa	well it depends on the school but usually yes. in my school it's about 1-2 days and it also depends how hard like if you left a bruise of some sort.And to tell the head well just say why you did it what did he do that made you go to violence but you have to admit it then it'll take off some of the consequences
JI7NQ9TNaa	It's not about one test...or even a lot of them.   Most kids need to be thoroughly examined by professionals who can tell how well the child is doing compared to what they are capable of.    In other words, a child with an IQ of 120 should be able to basic school work. If they are failing a certain number of courses, and are found to have a Learning disability, they can classed as Special Ed.|`|vMByDy1raa	Special education is based on doctor's diagnosis  or if the school test you and you fall within the guideline.

wB8bK0vFaa	When you feel like you're getting really sleepy, take a  really cold shower. If you think you're going to fall asleep, try to wear as little clothes as possible and not use blankets (so you'll be too cold to fall asleep) or use a lot of blankets and wear layers of clothes (so you'll be too hot to fall asleep.)    Drink caffeine and watch television. Use the computer or listen to really upbeat music that gets you hyper. Do NOT listen to calming music.  Put ice on your eyes :D (Haha just kidding. That might work though.) Anyways, write, draw, do anything that interests you and you'll be fine.  I've done it before.|`|Uhyu3iCbaa	Make sure you have things to entertain you.

QkFnEIWSaa	There is a saying that I happen to like:  The only stupid question is the one that is not asked. I don't see any shame in asking questions or in being a so called "teacher's pet." From what I understand, you are trying to understand the material. There is no shame in that.    Though in the case of that, if she thinks that you are retarded, she really needs to learn something about teaching.    Anyway, what do you want to convince her of? That you are capable of going into a higher level course? For that, the only thing I can think of is that you need to brush up on your grammar and spelling. Other than that, I have no real advice.|`|AA11123061	okay , first of all just be urself . listen to what shes saying , asking questions doesnt make u a retard . i mean if the questions are inappropriate and silly then ask after the class is over . dont push it . just concentrate on studies, and get good grades . do some researh before class so u know what she is about to teach u guys . keep a distance with ur teacher ,dont be all in her face,if u know what i mean .    the best way to handle this is to sit with ur teacher after the class is over and esplain to her that u want to be the best student in class .    good luck|`|QsQj8jO7aa	try talking to her after class. If she says no have your parents talk to the offices. If they say no, too bad. These are the consequences of going to government mandated public school, you get stuck wherever they put you.|`|nv0nIj3Daa	well, judging from this 'article' that you have just typed, you'd do well in applied, or standard, whatever the crap that is. and if the teacher thinks asking questions make you dumb - she's dumb, there's nothing wrong with asking questions. really. and btw, it should have been 'there' not 'their' in my teacher said their are like 10 students who want to move up.
inZ9CWBiaa	No, schools aren't perfect. Schools are full of people - teachers, students, administrators, parents, etc. People aren't perfect, so schools can't be! Good schools keep trying to get better - but it is so tricky because everyone has a different understanding of what school should be.   Hope that helps.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	no. they arent.
pPYfrdAEaa	I'm not sure about you, but at my school, we have AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC, and both are ap classes except BC is harder (covers more info in the same amount of time).  From what I hear, most of the students who are in Calc AB thinks it's pretty easy, while BC leaves most students crying.  I'm planning on taking AB next year, it doesn't seem that bad.  I think you should take it =]

If you have a freezer have children watch you fill up the ice trays with water (or put tooth picks in cool aid so they get Popsicles when it freezes), then put it in the freezer.  Use the scientific process for more in-depth lesson.    Problem Statement Question: How do we make ice?    Research: freezing temperatures of water-- have books available with this information to read to them if you have the internet show them you can research on that.    Hypothesis or Prediction: the kids then make a prediction or a hypothesis, based on the information you read them.    Materials and Procedure:  Write down the steps and materials needed to do the "experiment" with the kids help.    Data Analysis:  Once the time is up for freezing (you set the time as part of the experiment) pull the frozen icicles out, have each child grab one and describe what they see happened.  Did each one freeze all the way? Make a chart, document how many yes and no.    Conclusion and Summary:  Do they Accept or reject hypothesis and explain implications.    You can put the information on a 3 sided display board like you see at science fair to make it even more interesting for them.
bf83119e024ab64c983c6074c0bb966caa	Is it possible to switch into a different section with a different professor? If the same class is available with a different professor and it is possible to transfer to that class, you should definitely do it. Talk to your academic adviser asap. College Algebra is usually a prerequisite class for many other classes you may be required to take (or just want to take), so it is important to get it out of the way as early as possible. Talk to your academic adviser about this issue as soon as you can. They will be able to give you the best advice possible for your situation. Obviously, however, you do not want to stay in a class you do not feel you will get a good grade in, switch if at all possible.
RWULWosFaa	One sunny day, we took a trip to Disneyland! I was so anxious to ride all the rides so that is exactly what i did! After going to eat, we were near Space Mountain and i got a sick and i threw up the lunch i just ate in the garage. After leaving Disneyland, we went to get some pizza. I was still feeling sick to the stomach so i grabbed a small salad. My brother had a ton of garlic cheese bread which smelled revolting to me. I was still a little sick and all of a sudden, i felt like i was going to vomit again. I was about to puke when i realized that i was going to puke all over the video games lying around. It was too late to go hurry to the garbage so i threw up again all over them.|`|ecqu0G0Waa	We went to disneyland, and I rode all the rides. Afterwards though,  I threw up my lunch in the garbage can by space mountain! Then, we left and had pizza, but I still felt sick, so I only had salad.

I got sick and the lunch I just ate ended up a garbage can by Space Mountain. We then left to eat pizza, but since I was still a trifle queasy, I had a salad instead. My brother had a lot of garlic cheese bread that smelled terrible at the time. This made me sick again, and soon the video games became covered in my freshly eaten salad.   Hope I could help!!

She follows me everywhere, you just have to ignore her and talk to your other friends|`|VeJLXLXjaa	Don't hint, say it to her face. You have to be as blunt as possible if you really want her off your tail. If she tells you bad words to impress you, look at her in a 'okaaay' matter, not in a disgusted matter. She'll begin to think it's pretty stupid and makes her look really bad (not the cool bad)    Also, walk faster and try going different ways to get to classes, or maybe go through crowded hallways to try and lose her. You can try ignoring her or not respond to her saying the words to show you don't care, that would most likely get her to stop.    Good Luck :)|`|CtwEFHcqaa	I think maybe you need to tell her straight up.|`|wFPnYWZiaa	tell her flat out that if shes gonna act that way ur not going to want to be friends with her do it nicely like when she copies you ask her kindly be like can you please not copy me its a little annoying...then when she cusses around you tell her the same way just say can yo not cuss around me please

AA11161012	I took the ASVAB. The only thing I can say about it is that now I receive all this garbage in the mail for the Armed Services.  Also, the little chart you get back when results come back is confusing. It doesn't really tell you how well you did in each section because it standardises it based on like four different groups. I got like a 92 or something and I had to look it up online to see what it meant.   I never had any desire to join the miliary but I will say the test was kind of misleading and a waste of time.|`|un3eUN4Taa	No. the ASVAB just tells you what kind of job you can get in the military....the higher the score, the more choices and vice versa.
SEnWTlcCaa	it's from one of Dr. Seus's poems called "Oh the places you'll go":    Oh, the Places You'll Go!     Congratulations!  Today is your day.  You're off to Great Places!  You're off and away!    You have brains in your head.  You have feet in your shoes  You can steer yourself  any direction you choose.  You're on your own. And you know what you know.  And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.    You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.  About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."  With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,  you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.    And you may not find any  you'll want to go down.  In that case, of course,   you'll head straight out of town.    It's opener there  in the wide open air.    Out there things can happen  and frequently do  to people as brainy  and footsy as you.    And when things start to happen,  don't worry. Don't stew.  Just go right along.  You'll start happening too.    OH!   THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!     You'll be on your way up!  You'll be seeing great sights!  You'll join the high fliers  who soar to high heights.    You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.  You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.  Wherever you fly, you'll be the best of the best.  Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.    Except when you don' t  Because, sometimes, you won't.    I'm sorry to say so  but, sadly, it's true  and Hang-ups  can happen to you.    You can get all hung up  in a prickle-ly perch.  And your gang will fly on.  You'll be left in a Lurch.    You'll come down from the Lurch  with an unpleasant bump.  And the chances are, then,  that you'll be in a Slump.    And when you're in a Slump,  you're not in for much fun.  Un-slumping yourself   is not easily done.    You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.  Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.  A place you could sprain both you elbow and chin!  Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?  How much can you lose? How much can you win?    And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...  or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?  Or go around back and sneak in from behind?  Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,  for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.    You can get so confused  that you'll start in to race  down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace  and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space,  headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.  The Waiting Place...    ...for people just waiting.  Waiting for a train to go  or a bus to come, or a plane to go  or the mail to come, or the rain to go  or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow  or waiting around for a Yes or a No  or waiting for their hair to grow.  Everyone is just waiting.    Waiting for the fish to bite  or waiting for wind to fly a kite  or waiting around for Friday night  or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake  or a pot to boil, or a Better Break  or a sting of pearls, or a pair of pants  or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.  Everyone is just waiting.    NO!  That's not for you!    Somehow you'll escape  all that waiting and staying.  You'll find the bright places  where Boom Bands are playing.    With banner flip-flapping,  once more you'll ride high!  Ready for anything under the sky.  Ready because you're that kind of a guy!    Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!  There are points to be scored. there are games to be won.  And the magical things you can do with that ball  will make you the winning-est winner of all.  Fame! You'll be famous as famous can be,  with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.    Except when they don't.  Because, sometimes, they won't.    I'm afraid that some times  you'll play lonely games too.  Games you can't win  'cause you'll play against you.    All Alone!  Whether you like it or not,  Alone will be something  you'll be quite a lot.    And when you're alone, there's a very good chance  you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.  There are some, down the road between hither and yon,  that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.    But on you will go  though the weather be foul  On you will go  though your enemies prowl  On you will go  though the Hakken-Kraks howl  Onward up many  a frightening creek,   though your arms may get sore  and your sneakers may leak.    On and on you will hike  and I know you'll hike far  and face up to your problems  whatever they are.    You'll get mixed up, of course,   as you already know.  You'll get mixed up  with many strange birds as you go.  So be sure when you step.  Step with care and great tact  and remember that Life's  a Great Balancing Act.  Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.  And never mix up your right foot with your left.    And will you succeed?  Yes! You will, indeed!  (98 and 3 / 4 percent guaranteed.)    KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!    So...  be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray  or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea,  you're off to Great Places!  Today is your day!  Your mountain is waiting.

If you browse throughout the book, you may see something that might like or dislike but it just means that you learned something more than a face value approach.|`|Jr6emga0aa	The general meaning is that you cannot judge the substance of anything by considering only superficial externalities ( e.g. a pretty girl who is a b...ch or a handsome hunk who is a rude fool ).|`|L3hc9EOiaa	You cant judge a book by it's cover.    to me it means not to make an opinion of something, just by first sighting     Literal meaning: many people come to a descision on something from first appearance and this is not the best way to make a judgemement, look at the whole picture before making an kind of judgement or opinion about something or someone|`|kZWKdPtOaa	It's like saying to a person you came across you have found so cute and you ask her out. You then come to realize she was crazy and all you where looking for is looks and not whats in the inside. Never take someone by how they look what matters is whats inside there soul there heart there feelings.  Example:  A guy walks by wearing a shirt that has grape juice all over and his hair looks messy and is wearing glasses. You assume he's a nerd or a geek of some kind. But you didn't know that he was the mare's son or the one person in the hole school that paid attention to sports and wrote articles about, and you where the football and you all wondered who was writing such nice stories of a game. Then you come to realize it was the so called geek that walked by and you called him rude names. Then you feel bad cause he is an amazing guy that loves football, and once played football but got injured and could never play again.     So the phrase means to not judge people by there appearances but whats in the inside counts.

Explaination:     Draw an equilateral triangle and label one side "x". Now draw a square and label one side "x+10".     Let's label the perimeter of the triangle "Pt" and the perimeter of the square "Ps". We know that Pt = 3x and Ps = 4(x+10).     According to the problem the Ps is 3 times Pt. Therefore Ps = 3(Pt). working it out using our variable it looks like 4(x+10)=3(3x) which reduces to 4x+40=9x     subtract 4x from each side and you get 5x=40 solving for x =40/5     x=8

AA10047588	You sound very mature and are quite articulate as well.  What you have done in this posting is a good start in what you can say in your defense, and add to it what you feel the fair punishment that you should receive.    Either I missed it or you didn't mention what grade you are in.  We had a kid in my son's school who broke into the school computer as a junior and was expelled.  He managed to get into a small college, went there for 18 months, and then transferred to a prestigious college as a sophomore, effectively "skipping a grade".  So if things don't go well, contact local colleges and see what you need to do to qualify as a freshman.  Your written English is better than most highschoolers' and if the rest of your grades are OK, you may be able to do so.  Keep your cool, admit your mistake, tell whoever is willing to listen how you intend to make up for this, and try to make the best of the situation.

BE SURE TO ENLARGE THIS MAP ON YOUR COMPUTER.    Routes to Texas in the 1820's were rare.  They were basically dirt trails or cattle routes.The El Camino Real (The King's Highway) had been long established by Missionary Padres through their travels in the Southwest - and their building of the Missions, from California to Texas.  Texas in 1820 was part of Mexico with very little American settlement.  Most of the common routes were from Mexico north.  By the 1830's, American ranchers begin to settle in Texas and eventually led to the Mexican-American war.
2Eaga0ywaa	H2CO3 is acid rain and its causes are natural phenomena and human activities.  Natural phenomena  The principal natural phenomena that contribute acid-producing gases to the atmosphere are emissions from volcanoes and those from biological processes that occur on the land, in wetlands, and in the oceans. The major biological source of sulfur containing compounds is dimethyl sulfide.    Human activities  The coal-fired Gavin Power Plant in Cheshire, Ohio The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as electricity generation, factories, and motor vehicles. Coal power plants are one of the most polluting. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke, but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.      H2SO4 is sulfuric acid and as a major component of acid rain, its causes are like of those in acid rain. Both natural and human sources release millions of tons of sulfur dioxide gas into Earth's atmosphere each year. Volcanoes are nature's main sulfur dioxide polluters. The oceans, biological decay, and forest fires are other natural sources of SO2. About three-fourths of the sulfur dioxide humans release comes from burning fossil fuels; half comes from burning coal, and 25-30% comes from burning oil. Other human-generated sources include smelting, the manufacture of sulphuric acid, conversion of wood pulp to paper, and the incineration of refuse. As mentioned above, some of the sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is converted into sulfuric acid upon contact with water.
PHlZ5sYgaa	It's always best to fill in something, since there is no penalty for wrong answers. Which letter you choose doesn't matter. I feel choosing the same letter is better so you'll be right hopefully 1/4 or 1/5 of the time, whereas if you choose different letters you may keep guessing around it. Contrary to urban legend, it does not matter what you pick.
ctIQDcflaa	Er well it hasn't happen to me because i never study i cram the period  before and i manage to get an A or B at least. idk how i do it, probably i have a good memory or something according to my teacher. she beleived i was "cheating" at first lol so in our last test she set me out in the hallway to do my test i managed to get a B+    It's ok maybe you should not worry to much about tests well you should worry but just a maximum level that doesn't take complete control of your life. Don't worry low Bs are still good, well i consider them to be good because at least you're passing. Sometimes when you focus on something too much like you really wanna suceed in the end you don't because you're focusing on it way to much to be perfect.   Or maybe you just need to review and scan over the material before the test is handed out that way you can remember what you need to know to make sure it's correct.     good luck xD|`|9oMYBhj8aa	Yea, that's happened to me a couple of times.  I guess the best thing to do would be to talk to your teachers and see if you can get some extra help.  Chances are that if you think your answers are right and they're not, then you're just not understanding the material.|`|K4XVkLWnaa	Yes, I stay after school very often and miss my after school activity for extra help. Even after that, I still do bad. I spent a lot of time studying for my Global exam, doing three 50 question online quizzes for extra credit that help review, along with one 85 question review quiz. I assume I did my part studying, but I only got a 74%.     My Science exam grade was only 76% and I studied equally for that. It's really a let down and a half. =/ Don't even get me started on geometry. I have an extra help class for that every other day, and I also stay after often yet I'm failing. The class I put the most effort in, I'm failing. Go figure. At least I passed the exam with a 66%.     Pfft, believe me. I know how you feel. But a lot of teens struggle with Geometry because the curriculum was changed. The plus side of that is the regents exam will be on a MAJOR curve.     Anyway, my suggestion is to get a 1-1 tutor. NOT YOUR OWN TEACHER. Yes, 1-1. Have he/she visit as often as possible to help you develop study methods. DO NOT give up.     I hope things get better, man.

PjzJ9QQRaa	What are your hobbies?  What kind of things are you passionate about?  Do you feel strongly opposed to something-such as child abuse?  Think about the things that you could really rant and rave to your friends about, and pick out of those topics.      The best speech will be one from your heart.  You could do one on various hairstyles if you were passionate about it.  What you are interested in will be what you make others interested in.    I could tell you to do a speech on horses, but if you don't care about them, then it will be pretty dull.

HKMTzxNSaa	If you are talking about Stephenie Meyer's Eclipse in the Twilight Saga, the sixth chapter starts off when Bella is going to Angela's house after going to Jacob Black's house without the permission and knowledge of Edward. Edward follows her to Angela's house, and since Bella does not want to face him, she let's him drive off. Bella enjoys her human time with Angela and then goes home where she finds Edward waiting for her. Edward is upset that Bella would put herself in danger and would go behind his back. He tries to forbid her from ever seeing him again. To ensure that this rule is enforced, he bribes Alice with the sports car she'd driven in Italy. Bella stays at the Cullen's house until Edward comes back from his hunting trip. Then Rosalie comes in Edward's room where Bella is sleeping to talk to her, and that is the end of chapter six.|`|t3txrruOaa	So, basically, the events that happen are that: She visits Angela to help her out with work, and since she's been spending all that time with the vampires and werewolves, she's just taking the time with her normal friend, just having a fun time, taking her mind off of all the crazy vampire/werewolf world. And the other thing that happens is that Edward get's super worried and over protective when it comes to her visiting the werewolves, so now he doesn't want her to visit Jacob. And Alice also invites Bella to a sleep over.|`|r0TUvZX9aa	havent gotten that far yet if you talkin bout the twilight eclipse but as soon as i do i will report!|`|Wng05H8uaa	Which eclipse?

Often, if you speak with the dean of english and request to be tested out of the foreign language requirement in place of ASL, they will work with you. Contact the National Association of the Deaf, (NAD) www.nad.org and they can give you a list of each school that will accept ASL as foreign language credit.|`|qE49jbVaaa	go steelers
WJjfrf0Caa	In the United States we use the term African-American. We consider these people to have one giant culture, so the next step is to assume that Africa is the same way.

Also Africa is a less developed country, and we are a more developed country. Plus Africa has starving people, and we have so much food that people throw away.

That is dysfunctional thinking and it won't help you one bit if you pull it with people in authority over you later in life either (like police officers , judges, and bosses). Learning to respect authority is a part of life.    I guess the teacher could have just called the principal, your parents, and gave you a permanent zero for the work you refused to do and then flunk your butt so you're still sitting there in baby grade school while your smarter friends go to high school.

3bahzW9Uaa	He should not be held back in 1st grade for a 2nd time.  No good for your son will come from this, He's already mastered the math, history and science from 1st grade. He'll get bored and act out if he has to repeat those subjects. He should be getting speech therapy, as well as working on a language comprehension program such as SRA Direct instruction.  A program such as this done in a small group setting really can make a difference.  Here's a link to a program that might be appropriate for your son.     https://www.sraonline.com/products.html?...     This is just one of many programs they offer.  You can even see video clips of this in action to see if it would be appropriate for your son.        You need to go to http://www.wrightslaw.com and start to brush up on advocacy skills so you can get your son the appropriate services at his next IEP meeting.    As a parent DO NOT SIGN the IEP stating that your child will be repeating 1st grade again.  I would not agree to this at all.  Get the copy of your "Parents Rights" handbook that the school gave you and see what their policy is on retention.       When you are at the next IEP meeting (which you can call any time you like)  Discuss your son's comprehension issue.  Ask what program they are using to help your son with his comprehension goals.  IF they're not addressing them, show them the material about SRA and ask if they have such a program.      Remember, when it comes to your son's IEP and the meetings, YOU are as much a member of the "TEAM" as everyone else at that table. Your suggestions and input on your son's educational program are equally important.  Start educating yourself all about the IEP process and the law. Learn the lingo like FAPE, appropriate, LRE, and how they apply to your son.   Just from the little bit you've given in your question I could write a letter to the principal and special ed director      Dear Principal and SpedDirector,  I'm concerned with the schools desire to retain my son for a second time in the 1st grade.  I believe he'll be denied FAPE due to the distress of being retained again.  Not only that, it will be in violation of LRE according to his IEP. He currently receives above average marks in history, math and science, so retention is not an appropriate remediation for his issues.  Another year in 1st grade will not be the LRE that he is entitled to by law.  We need to have a new IEP meeting to set appropriate accommodations and services to address the issues that are causing the school to want to retain my son.  I expect to hear from you by 2/13/09 to address this matter.  (give 5 days for response).|`|PnlgLBcwaa	What have they done to provide remediation?    Does he have an IEP?    You are saying he gets all As and Bs-it doesn't make sense to hold him back...    There is debate if children should be held back at all--but if they are suggesting a 2nd time--they really need to evaluate why the class is not meeting his needs...    If you hold him back again-he will be 2 years older than his classmates--while acceptable--that can cause a problem-    is there one specific area they are concerned with (i.e reading)...than tehy should be providing additional support in that area now...and into 2nd grade|`|ORonhAuvaa	You didn't mention the key ingredient for holding a child back. That is reading. Because of the No Child Left Behind act, kids may not advance until they are reading on grade level.     If I were you, I would make an appointment with the principal and discuss this. I don't think a child should be held back twice, but that is just my opinion. There is very little research that shows that kids do better when they are held back. In fact, retention is highly correlated with the high school drop out rate.    Holding a child back is a school decision, but as a parent you have input. First look at your child's reading scores and them make a decision. Have them show you what special attempts they have made to remediate the reading problem.    I have been in the education field for over 25 years and I have only met two racist teachers. One was white and one was black. Most teachers are color blind when it comes to loving kids, it goes with the program.    However, that being said, some teachers are not culturally sensitive and have difficulties with behavioral differences. So make sure your kid is not being held back because of behavior.    Finally, you need to look on the 'Net and read about the new Response To Intervention law. Instead of holding your kid back, he can enter one of the intervention tiers of which there are three. I would tell them that you want 2nd grade intensive reading.
NJNqnEbnaa	Well, Thoreau was a Transcendentalist, and a major one of their beliefs was self-reliance. They were also very much for individualism. He most likely would not approve of it. In "Walden", he talks to a poor Irishman and basically tells him to learn and become a philosopher like him. Check out that book for some good examples of what he thought!|`|Jr6emga0aa	He would say that becoming dependent on others limits your personal liberty. He would probably, however, make a distinction between a temporary helping hand and a permanent dependency.
inZ9CWBiaa	I teach primary (elementary) school. I guess the answer is both because to be honest  I wouldn't do it for free! But having said that - with the education and experience I have I could easily get another job that would pay more where I could work shorter hours, not take work home with me and not have to go in on weekends!    At the end of the day, I teach because I love teaching, not because I love the money.|`|e2926326f61b2becbde04426fcb444c8aa	If I loved money I wouldn't be a teacher.  I want my students to do well in the classes I give as well as in their lives.  I teach high school all morning long and give a few hours of class in university in the afternoons.|`|TCINOEX1aa	I do it for the money not my students|`|9pOsLqSzaa	I'm not a teacher, but I've asked many of my teachers this before, why they teach.    One of them said he likes to teach because it helps him relearn the material, and he likes being able to help other people understand it as well. I know he's not doing it for the money because his salary is pretty terrible for what he does.    I've had other responses, none of which said money, but one said she stayed because of the money, after being treated terribly by some of her students.    It's something you can only really judge by each situation. Different people choose different jobs for all different reasons. You can ask your teachers or teachers you know why they went in to teaching. For many teachers, the money simply isn't good enough to be worth dealing with misbehaved, ungrateful kids every day. These are high school teachers that I've asked, by the way.|`|hhRuKIzRaa	The money is mediocre to say the least. I teach elementary school and I love my students....|`|sqPglTDVaa	I am also a primary teacher (elementary).  I am not teaching for the money and doubt that many teachers would.  Although it might not seem like that as a student looking at your own teachers.  The opportunity for increase in pay is better in other fields than teaching...
1cJjGNOBaa	you need to keep reinforcing that "we don't talk like that in school" and that it's not nice to talk like that anywhere. I personally would ask the director about enforcing some sort of discipline after a warning- a time out or such. Kids aren't going to stop that behavior just because you say it's not nice- they need to "feel it"! I've been taking care of kids for 38 years and you're right, it's getting far worse. I'm a pretty tough nanny, I'll tell you and the 2 kids I watch aren't allowed to speak like that- but I have more leeway than you, probably. I also have 3 grandkids and they most definitely aren't allowed to speak like that without being sent to time out! Good luck- and don't let this discourage you- you CAN and DO make a difference in these kids lives! (Check out nannying- you make a LOT more money AND have much more freedom and power!)|`|TfohdmjJaa	Well todays society is growing around a "hip hop" culture which includes a lot of these harmful words everyone just wants to fit in and wants to be cool maybe they got if from their siblings?

The cartoons these days on some of the stations are really out of control. Some parents just sit their kids in front of the TV instead of watching them and playing with them...it's really sad.|`|AA10953999	Yeah I agree with Nanny, you just have to keep telling them their behavior is not acceptable. Ask them if they know what it means to bash someone's head in and explain how it would really hurt someone. A lot of times kids do not understand the severity of what they are saying.|`|lzIWgzA7aa	Those are really terrible things to have to hear from children.  It's no wonder you're feeling like you don't like teaching anymore.  Maybe you would enjoy teaching younger children who don't say things like that.  I don't even deal with that age for that very reason.    With that said, it's important to remember that children at that age are asserting their independence, which is why they're saying things like that when you want them to nap.  It's important that you don't react to those things.  If you do, they will continue to do it.  Tell them things like "we don't talk like that at school" or "those words hurt people's feelings and it is unacceptable."  Be assertive, and continue to tell them that you understand that they do not want to lie down or take a nap but it is not a choice.|`|vGR21rgHaa	you need to reinforce to the kids that there are rules in you center and that bad words are not allowed. tell them they have to have "kind words, hands, feet etc" so not bad words, yelling, punching, kicking etc.  and if the kids do not follow your rules then you need to discipline them, a "time out" is fine. or make them draw a picture about how they ar feeling, and tell them how their words etc make you and others feel.  kids need to have someone in their lives who is prepared to teach them some values, which is something i see is often over looked these days by the parents.  children act like what they see on tv, or from their home environment, this including their neighbours etc.  Good luck.|`|VNYTjH0Yaa	hi there,    i agree with all the above, it is just horrible how children behave.   maybe you could discuss this with your boss. i think something like a project week where all the attention goes out on how to behave, talk, socialize ect. ect. and do some 'formalities' like letting the children sign an anti-bullying,foul language contract, of course not a real one, but often it makes them realize why they are not allowed to do or say certain things. as most parents tell the children off and don't explain them why they can not say these things it makes it even more interesting for them to use foul language to test their boundaries.    i hope this has been of any help, and i hope you will start to enjoy teaching again!    good luck!|`|s9czxUbdaa	Ok,    I really don't mean to sound rude and do not in any way say that this is acceptable or that your feelings aren't  warranted, but I work for a Head Start program that I love for the children to be saying that.     Instead, the children that I work with use profanity and use it correctly. They also will not hesitate to hit, kick, bit, punch you either. The truth is children are a product of their environment. We as teachers can only do so much and it can be truly frustrating to see no changes.     If I were you I would talk to my supervisor and try to find a violence prevention curriculum to use. I use second step in my classroom every year and about this time of year the children start to grasp it. Also I would explain to the children when they say things like "I want to hit you with a hammer" what would happen. For example- "If you hit Mr TJ with a hammer it would really hurt me" and so on.     As for the parents, I would be VERY firm with them about the situation. Explain that this behavior is not acceptable and the they need to try and speak with their children about the issue. I try to explain to my families that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated when their child goes to kindergarten- they will be excluded. That usually helps parents understand that it is not a joking matter.    Just hang in there and remember that it could always be better but it could also get worse|`|iCtMtPUQaa	I'm sure that this is because of the cartoons they watch. A lot of cartoons nowadays have phrases like "You stupid head!" or "Do that and I'll kill you!" which children will think is funny since their favorite cartoon characters are saying it.    and about the kids saying No to you. i have a theory that the parents are spoiling them. the parents are letting the children do what they want whenever and give them anything they desire. doing those things will surely spoil a child.
inZ9CWBiaa	School can be very frustrating for bright children. The first thing that I would have suggested is what you have already done. I think that your next step needs to be over the teacher's head - is there a teacher in charge of the grade? Otherwise you may need to go to the principal. Ask why the school (or the teacher) isn't differentiating instruction as a matter of policy - of if they do, why has this teacher not been willing to do so for your child? Talk to other parents (maybe at the PTA???) about their experiences. If your child had a learning disability, the school would support him, so there is no reason why he shouldn't be supported with extension. It is important that you solve this because bright children who get bored often underachieve.   If you are in a position to, try and provide some intellectual stimulation during after school hours. Some places offer foreign languages, or music, or art lessons. Follow your son's interests.    Best of luck|`|deOxABCGaa	Maybe you should wait until your son is in grade three or something, because all first grade work I used to get was a joke, sort of, so it was pretty easy for me too but it does get harder and more interesting in grade three onwards because you  actually get proper work.|`|hhBQe6Jdaa	um...am 14 n am still in school so i remember those tomes when i was in 1st grade    so first i think you can explain things to him with an emample that he would be interested in...like with sports    you also can give him a reason to study like explane and shou hem how his life will turn out if he wont study like tell him about the differenses between homeless ppl and busnessmans      or just say tht you would buy him something he really wants if he will study and to make it he will trying to learn more about all that they learning in school and if he really smart he will find out that school is interesting while doing that and start to learn by himself      8D I HOPE IT WILL HELP
89hHdGsEaa	Actually, this is complete preference. I will break it all down for you. I took AP and CC courses while in highschool.    On your transcripts, you will have a weighted and an unweighted GPA if you take any AP or Honors courses recognized by your school towards an Honor Diploma. When you take an AP course, they tend to boost your GPA by 1 full point per class. So, if I make a 3.0GPA in AP Chemistry, I will actually receive the weighted grading of a 4.0GPA. Transcripts reflect both of these GPA's, which the college will see. Now, AP courses are usually taken to not only give you an overall better GPA (assuming you do good) during your highschool term, but it also is required in order to take the National Test for that subject to earn a college credit. If you take AP Chemistry, pay and take the exam, and then pass with a score of 3 or more, then you received a credit when you transfer into college.     Also, AP courses are usually only offered to those who do well in that particular subject in school. You have to remember though, that if you take the AP course and don't pass with a 3 or more on the National Exam, you will not receive any credit towards college.    My advice, would be to take the AP course(s) if you feel that you are able to learn and grasp what it is, because not only do you get credit for the subject in school towards your diploma, a weighted GPA to boost your overall standing on transcripts, but you can also have earned college credit at the same time from the exam. This usually allows you to skip the subject or earn a partial credit towards the particular subject level in college.    One thing to keep in mind also ... in terms of admission to colleges/universities, is that some do not allow you to apply as a freshman if you have even one class from a college prior to being admited to their school. I found this out when I applied to UCLA. They would not admit me on a freshman basis, so I had to wait a full semester before I could attend, which set me back. Check with your college/university. Usually, it's university policy and not so much a community college. Depends on where you'd like to go.|`|wa401B0raa	I have that same question i don't know if i should take Ap English Four next year or Dual credit so thanks for asking it and lets hope for a good answer.  :]|`|XFQzqcGYaa	Depends. If you take the AP course (and pass the test with at least a 3), it will look better than if you take an actual course (because you'll get a higher level of diploma). However, if you aren't confident in your test taking abilities, just take the community college class. Both are weighted the same.|`|enbe5jLUaa	AP by far. I know my college will let you get credit from APs but not from community colleges because AP is far more trustworthy some tiny community college no one outside of your city has heard of. and it's probably cheaper.

vW9qF5lSaa	I went through something very similar in elementary school, so I understand. I was one of about 5 or 6 black kids in my school and was the ONLY one in my grade up until 6th grade (we got ONE other girl). Once people got to know me, it seemed that my color didn't matter as much, though some of their parents still disapproved of me being friends with their children...    I just tried to be myself and ignore anyone who had something to say.  I was at the top of my class and had lots of friends, and suddenly everyone was fascinated with my hair (I got the "can I touch your hair" almost every damned day) and what I liked to listen to and yada yada.  I was usually the "funny one" in the group, or the one that would defend people that were being bullied.  In the end, I actually had a worse experience when I moved in jr. high and attended a 50/50 school!    Have you talked seriously with your parents about it?  Do they know what's going on?  Have they taken any measures to do anything about it?  I'm not sure if talking with any of your school officials will help...and I KNOW you weren't serious when you said you thought we were done with segregation, right?  Segregation and racism are still rampant in this country, unfortunately.  It's a sad, sad truth.    I'm SO sorry you're having to deal with such ignorant BS.  I think you need to have a long talk with your parents and tell them seriously and honestly what's going on.  If they think you're just whining and not really serious, then they won't be either.  Let them know what this is REALLY doing to you.      They are right about one thing, though -- you HAVE to stay strong.  You can NOT let those ignorant, classless, backwards jerkoffs get you down.  DON'T let that happen, no matter what.  Cussing them out is only going to add fuel to the fire and validate the whole "angry black person" stigma.  Until you and your family find a suitable solution, you are going to have to stand tall and proud and strong and let them know that whatever they say is going to roll down your back and off your a$$, and when they know they can't get to you, they'll back down at least SOME.    You need real support, though.  Try talking to your family again, and be VERY, VERY serious and honest.

inZ9CWBiaa	I have to disagree with Sarah - it is wrong to cheat! Not only are you cheating yourself of the learning, you are stealing the intellectual property of the person you are cheating from.

psvFWDN8aa	I loveeee it! My mom's friend from work is also called Krysten, and it's an awesome name.    It's way more unique than the original spelling of the name (Kristen).  Yup, I have one too. My name is Jennah, but the normal way for it to be spelled is usually Jenna. That's what happens when you have parents that always want to stand out.    You know, when I first saw your name I thought it was pronounced (Krist-ten), and I was right, LOL!    You should love your name, and be thankful to have such a cool, unique, and amazing name.     X0X0,  Jennah L. ;) ;)|`|4fC6EJWfaa	I don't know how anyone can mispronounce that.  Go by Kristy. Problem solved.|`|vcWuPlOyaa	I like the unique spelling.|`|ECtW0jx3aa	I wish I had that have.

You can always change it when you get older. But i think you could totally work it girl friend lol. on the bright side you coulda got something worse like i know this one girl named Jaquarter yeah (Ja-quarter is how you pronounce it) and this one girl her mom was a crack head so on her birth certificate she wrote under name "Abcdefg" (yep the first 7 letters of the alphabet|`|GxZVZLlHaa	I like the way it's spelled!

zhJOZhKEaa	I think you are going to have that rough patch after any move... even if your kids were in public school.  Its a whole new world for all of you.  Starting over where you know no one is going to be tough at first.    I know my kids actually do *better* in new situations with me there because they feel safe... they know where 'base' is and that they can always come back.  In public school she would still be unsure of her new surroundings... she just wouldn't have you there as her 'anchor'.  I think she'll start moving away a bit given lots of opportunities and gentle encouragement.    I've homeschooled my 11yr old while having babies at home... in fact we now have a 4yr old, 3yr old and 1 1/2yr old.  It can be interesting at times... but I still think it is best for our family.  We just drag the crew along to activities for homeschoolers and jump in with both feet.  It doesn't always go smooth because my son and I have Aspergers.  Social situations will always be 'interesting' for us.  But there really is no way to make it easier but to do it.      I'd say just keep looking for those groups and activities and jumping in!  Before you know it you will be needing to pick and choose because you can't do it all.  In fact right now I would be glad to loan you a few of our activities... I'm starting to overload a bit.  :)  We are commited to them all now but we'll have to cut back some next year.    Good luck!  Feel free to email if you'd like to 'brainstorm' together a bit on ideas for activities or how to homeschool with babes in the house.|`|K0FabRAIaa	If she is extra shy now, and you sign her up for full time public school, your attentions will probably be shifted to helping her adjust to being away from you as well as the new social situation. It might be even harder than simply trying to find other social activities around town. She might thrive, but I've seen a lot of tears when children are new in school at that age - separation anxiety. Have you asked her what she wants to do? If she wants to go to school, I say go for it....     I do believe she will come out of her shell on her time if you (and she) choose to continue homeschooling. Being shy is OK.  : )  Being around other children at dance class will help!    You sound like a very loving mom. She is lucky!    Here is an interesting link. Put in your zip code and you can find out about home school field trips in your area.....  http://www.fieldtripfactory.com/home.php...|`|Z5g7hCXraa	Your oldest is only five, still a baby!  Let her adjust to the new baby and the move, and don't pressure her.  Your little daughter needs to be with you now more than ever when she is dealing with some kind of stress (cowering when she meets someone).  If you are concerned about social skills, I suggest three things:  Love on her like crazy.  Mommy is more important and much more powerful in the life of a child than anyone else!  Remove unneeded stress, and let her be little.  Build her confidence at home.  Start by having her complete tasks you know she can do.  When you go out, make a "together outing".  Don't leave her.  Talk about the outing before you go, with brief instructions.  Remember, social skills are built at home first!  That is the center of her universe!    Don't give up on homeschooling.|`|bCi8BCBBaa	My advice is to go with your gut after exploring homeschooling in your area more.  You're right about dance classes not having a lot of time to socialize.  My daughter dances.  But your daughter will meet other children there and may want to have a play date with them.  If the yahoo groups start meeting in the spring, go to a few meetings and see what type of a fit they are for you.  Maybe the parents there will have more resources for social opportunities. After doing that, if you feel that school is the wrong choice - it is.  If you don't feel the area you moved to or groups offer enough for a young child, you might give school a try.  Whether its homeschool, public schools, christian schools, parochial schools, secular private schools,  you'd be the one to figure out what's the best choice for her and your family.     I know that my answer won't be the most popular, but I am a firm believer that we are the best judges of our families and our needs and that we make the right decisions for ourselves when we make them in a logical way. Sometimes our decision to homeschool isn't popular with our extended families.  Sometimes the decision to school isn't popular with other homeschooling families.  Explore homeschooling in your new area through the winter and spring.  You can make any decisions in the fall.  No need to rush.|`|h6JFTdo8aa	You sound like you know educating your child will be no problem.  You have more going for you than you think.  First of all, I think you are worrying needlessly. Your child will grow out of "cringing" around strangers.  I believe she is the answer to helping you with this new baby.  She will feel much appreciated if you are including her in helping you with the baby, whether running errands or whatever.  This will give her the confidence.  First of all, I have learned that real "socializing" begins in the home.  We all have our doubts in some area when first homeschooling.  I am a very experienced homeschooling mother.  I have been profoundly blessed with three boys, ages 6, 13 and 14.  We have always homeschooled and their being shy around strangers was only normal, esp. at such a young age your daughter now is.  I myself was very shy at that age and it did not help going to school.  I actually overcame my shyness when I finished school.  My boys are actually a  lot more outgoing than I was and I was always timid.  I don't think a public school or any school can solve the problem, maybe worsen it.  I believe it depends on the child's personality.  Also, as you introduce her to people you know this teaches her that she can eventually speak to the ones we do know.  It sounds like your daughter just needs some confidence.  I hope this is helpful to you.  I realize you have gone through a lot with the move, a new baby and now trying to decide on the homeschool.  First of all, ask yourself why you want to homeschool and stick to those  reasons.  The socializing will take care of itself in time.  Please believe me.  My family live way out in the "boonies".  We don't always see a lot of people but most people they meet notice they are well behaved.  They also have a very mature way in conversing with their elders and are very respectful.  That means a lot to me.  My oldest is going on 15 and in the 10th grade.  It was  only yesterday I was debating to homeschool him.  I now know it is the  best thing I have ever done for my boys, their dad and myself.  This time has flown by and I envy you with that new baby to enjoy and that precious little girl who will enjoy playing "mommy" with her new baby sibling.  It is really easier leaving her at home than running her to school every day with a new baby.  Wishing you the best.|`|9HRkwzruaa	Honestly, children learn social skills everywhere.  I've homeschooled my (now) 6th grader for the last five years, and we've had a variety of situations - years when we're out everywhere, doing everything with everybody, and years where we pretty much stay at home and do things together.  (Not saying we never leave the house, but a quiet year.)  He isn't socially handicapped and works well in a variety of situations - it's just that every year doesn't need to be a social year.    It's really pretty much a myth that children need constant social instruction - they don't.  Of course they need to learn how to act in society, but they don't learn that from their peers.  She's cowering when she meets new children because she's shy or because she's not sure if they'll like her, not because you've crippled her in some way :)  The way to fix this isn't to send her to school (especially when homeschooling is working for her), but to slowly put her in situations where she can make some friends and gain some confidence.      If you think about it, she's never been put in this situation before - you lived in a town where you had a social network, and she just grew up from birth around the same kids.  Now, everything is new, even your family structure, and you and your dh are her "constants" in a world of variables - of course she's going to cling to you.  Any child her age would.  Have a friend with a child her age over to play for an hour or two, and be involved until they become comfortable with each other.  Let her join dance and figure out that kids in your new town aren't that different than kids in your old one.  She's not handicapped, she's just scared - and you break her of that by being her strength and guidance until she gains strength of her own.    It'll happen; we moved across country when my son was 6, and he did the same thing.  It did take him several months to gain his footing, but he gained it (without putting him in school).  Just give her some time and help her adjust with baby steps.  She'll get there, promise :)|`|Aq0QQnxeaa	If you feel that home schooling is best for her learning you could keep doing that but try other options such looking for community activities to enroll her in such as a sport or something like girl scouts... If I was in your shoes I would enroll her in some activities as well as school. It seems she needs to catch up on her social skills and so getting her involved as possible seems like the best thing to do for her. Also if you attend a church they usually have Sunday school or other activities for children. You can always take her out of school later and home school her if you feel that she is better off being home schooled.
QlBLZ4tVaa	Although we aren't Greek, my daughter and I attend the annual Greek Festival in Nashville, TN.

b651a8c169b6d9487947e546de9a0530aa	Once Gutenberg decided to make metal type, he began to search for the right metal. He finally settled on a mixture of lead and tin, an alloy that is easy to melt and cast, but which retains its shape under pressure. He also devised a method of making metal molds.    First, the letter was carefully cut, shaped, and polished on the end of a copper or iron rod. Next, this was hammered into a soft metal, probably lead, where it left a negative impression. Then, the alloy for the type itself was melted and poured into the mold.    Besides this, Gutenberg also designed a tray into which the individual letters ware assembled as words and clamped into place. The tray was set into a hand press, inked, and squeezed down on the sheet of paper. We can see that Gutenberg did not invent just a method of making movable type. He devised the entire process of printing from the type-casting and the mixing of the ink to the final steps of typesetting and stamping. Like all other basic inventions, it was revolutionary. Many copies could be made in a short time and then the same type could be remove and reassembled for another printing.    The printing press developed from wine making press. The inked type faced upwards and paper pressed down on to it|`|c3DqvgE4aa	Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg (c. 1398  February 3, 1468) was a German goldsmith and printer who is credited with being the first European to use movable type printing, in around 1439, and the global inventor of the mechanical printing press. His major work, the Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.

It is harder to turn  the lemons life gives other people into the same beverage.        When you are older you see life on a scale where people are not condemned to one outlook or another. Some days you are up and some days down. But most of the time you are  realistic about what is achievable and what isn't.       I liken it to people who audition for American Idol. Some people are optimistic on winning, but they can't sing and they look terrible. They are wasting their time. They are optimistic  fantasists.  They focus on thinking  positive not their talent.  If they auditioned for a joke that would be fine, but some are generally distraught or angry on rejection. They are unrealistic.        But if you have a great voice and can sing. You might win , not because you wish and hope. It's because you are a  talented optimistic realist. You realistically have a chance. They are realistic.      So it is not black or white but a scale.        I am was always told I was a pessimist because I expect the worse. Which was true.      But people confuse pessimistic with defeatist.  That is WRONG.    A defeatist gives up a pessimistic person expects the worse.    So we are usually prepared for disasters , tragedies, accidents.    We are normally the people who do the sensible careers and are the shoulders that people cry on.     When the optimistic people who can't sing get rejected on American Idol , we are the ones with the  sensible advice. As we predicted they would be turned down.       Some of the so -called optimistic people are extremely condemning. Tut -tut shame on you. We pessimists are obviously more objective.       Because you think something will turn out badly doesn't mean you throw your hands up , give up and do nothing.      That is ludicrous. We make other arrangements and interventions. Jeese Louise ! When we get rejected for American Idol we don't care  because we have gone to college and got a degree. We have not optimistically  directed our entire life on one unstable show and a precarious career!    People who describe themselves as optimists. Normally romanticised the world yet ironically denigrate others who don't share their outlook.    I am a pessimist but all this negative talk coming from the so called optimists is truly frightening.     Lighten up people - you painting a bleak picture of other people.    Optimists tend to spend a disproportionate amount of time  telling pessimists how negative they are.    I am not a misery, I don't wring my hands and give up. I don't see life as all bleak and I am not suicidal.  I simply can see that certain tasks are bound for failure and so alternatives or interventions are needed.      Now I have read some of these optimistic posts I am thoroughly delighted I am a pessimist. Optimistic people seem a little overbearing, judgemental, obstinate, arrogant   and patronising for my liking.     In the aim to prove that optimistic people are great- some people are totally intolerant and negative about people who aren't. WOW!    Which are all  negative qualities|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Delusional Disorder.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	You have a positive attitude.|`|ifTMSSjdaa	you are always happy and seeing the best of situations|`|Po4Lljjwaa	You have a positive outlook on life.

Those who think of future are called optimists.    Hope is a belief in a positive outcome related to  events and circumstances in one's life. Hope  implies a certain amount of perseverance i.e.  believing that a positive outcome is possible even  when there is some evidence to the contrary.     A person who dreads of 'what tomorrow may bring'  looses the zeal of life itself. He can not live in  the present even for one day. I do not agree that  'any person can fight the battles of just one  day'. There are many in the world who fight their  battles life long, and still live with some hope.     It is nice to live for today and complete what is  to be done today. But humans are distinguished  from the rest of the living beings by hope. For  other living beings, there may not be tomorrow.  But hope is life for humans. Tomorrow may not come  for a few. But the others are sure that there will  be a day after present one. And it is hoped by  many to be a little better than today. What is not  realized today may be within our reach tomorrow.  It is hope that make people to live through all  torments of life. The moment a person loses hope,  the very zeal to live is lost.    Living in the past is dreaming. Living in the  present is intuition connected to basic instincts.  Living in hope of is humanistic rationality  to look for future.     Hope - Pandora brought the jar with the evils and  opened it. It was the gods` gift to man, on the  outside a beautiful, enticing gift, called the  "lucky jar." Then all the evils, those lively,  winged beings, flew out of it. Since that time,  they roam around and do harm to men by day and  night. One single evil had not yet slipped out of  the jar. As Zeus had wished, Pandora slammed the  top down and it remained inside. So now man has  the lucky jar in his house forever and thinks the  world of the treasure. It is at his service; he  reaches for it when he fancies it. For he does not  know that the jar which Pandora brought was the  jar of evils, and he takes the remaining evil for  the greatest worldly good - it is hope! For Zeus  did not want man to throw his life away, no matter  how much the other evils might torment him, but  rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew.  To that end, he gives man hope.     A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity;  an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.  - Winston Churchill     "Three grand essentials to happiness in this life  are something to do, something to love, and  something to hope for." - Joseph Addison    Hope!  Hope! Hope!  Delicious Hope! when naught to man is left -   Of fortune destitute, of friends bereft;  When even his dog deserts him, and his goat  With tranquil disaffection chews his coat  While yet it hangs upon his back; then thou,  The star far-flaming on thine angel brow,  Descendest, radiant, from the far skies   To touch the deepest depths of the heart    People sow seeds with hope  And hope is the seed of life  People through ages hoped for eternity  Because hope is as great as eternity  Never give-up hope, never ever  Hope is your best mate, all the time  Even if all desert you unexpectedly  Hope will be with you, if you wish....|`|i1sG53IHaa	you always see the positive side of things

See the link below for more.|`|bs0edvMIaa	The short story is that two brothers had a longcase clock that kept great time.  However, when the first brother died it started to lose time, up to an hour a day. Later when the 2nd brother died it stopped on the hour he died and would not work again.  The best clockmakers were brought in but the clock would no longer work.  Later a man wrote a song about this story and referred to the longcase clock as his "grandfather's clock"  The song was a hit and the rest as they say is history. Longcase clocks were developed from church clocks and have a fascinating history.

a8BL5vCMaa	Matt S - Hello  Best info is from Housing. Just because there are rooms that size doesn't mean You can get one. If U r new U get what they give U. Request move when U get in. Most rooms r double, w/ some singles. Share bed ( kidding) or bunk them, some rooms r set up to do that. Most rooms are probably too small for 3. My best guess is your chances are better in Sylvan, which has 3- room suites. Many NorthEast or Central rooms are biggest on campus. There is the new North area, DK about it. Sylvan rooms are doubles and singles. Ask Housing, who have the best info which dorms, and how to request the share. No guarantees.

Its an A, B, C, D, and F system (with pluses and minuses within the letters), and A through C are passing (with A being the best).|`|xbISxnmfaa	ANY of the Ivy League schools are great for business especially Harvard.  Here a list of top Business schools.  http://www.viewpoints.com/Top-Five-Gradu...  And this the order of U.S degrees    Bachelors Degree    Students at four-year undergraduate colleges and universities in the USA earn bachelors degrees.    Most students earn one of two types of bachelors degrees:        * bachelor of arts      * bachelor of science    You also may earn a more specialized bachelors degree, such as a bachelor of arts in journalism.    Colleges and universities in America have their own list of majors in which you can earn a bachelors degree. Some even will let you create your own college major!  Masters Degree    You can earn a masters degree at a US graduate school in nearly any field.    The subject you study will determine the type of masters degree you will earn, such as a:        * master of arts      * master of science      * master of business administration    Some masters degree programs are terminal, but others can eventually lead to a doctoral degree.    Before you are accepted into a masters degree program, you probably will need to take the GRE or GMAT.  Doctoral Degree    A doctoral degree is the highest type of US college degree.    A doctor of philosophy (PhD) is the most common type of doctoral degree. Some fields, however, require a doctoral degree before you can obtain a job, including:        * doctors      * lawyers      * dentists      * veterinarians    Field such as these may also require US licensure.  .  .    You have a nearly unlimited number of options when you earn a US college degree. You choose not only the type of degree but also the field that you want to study. Knowing the degree you want will help you decide which US university is right for you.|`|GemKt7XWaa	HBS, Harvard Business School is most prestigious; 2 years will set you back about $160,000 though.|`|ZyV2InIPaa	harvard princeton and yale are the top three.   and as for the final degrees, i'm not quite sure what you mean :(  sorry!  hope i was a little helpful haha|`|eyiot3mmaa	The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business is among the top in the nation.  It is an Ivy League.    Im not sure about what you mean about final degrees.  There's Bachelors, Masters, Doctorates.  I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for. If you mean grades it's typically looked at as a GPA (Grade Point Average) which is out of a 5.0, that being the highest.|`|809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	I believe the most prestigeous undergraduate business program in the US is at the University of Pennsylvania. You probably won't go too far wrong with a degree from an Ivy League school. Also--bit of interesting trivia-- the Ivy League is actually an athletic league that happens to include eight of the oldest and most prestigeous private universities in the US (including Harvard, Yale and Princeton). A lot of very prestigeous schools in the US (like Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, CalTech) aren't technically Ivies.    The US doesn't have a classification system of degrees per se; instead the grades you get in college are averaged and you can report that number on applications and your CV. Top students in a class my also graduate with various grades of honors (laude, *** laude, and summa *** laude) though this isn't really comprable to the British degree classifications.    I am amused to note after the fact that YA will not let me use c-u-m.

zgTsCicNaa	Japans role in WW1 was mainly to protect the sea lanes in the Far East so most of their encounters were naval ones.    Japan participated in World War I from 1914 to 1917, as one of the major Entente Powers, played an important role in securing the sea lanes in South Pacific and Indian Oceans against the Kaiserliche Marine. Politically, Japan seized the opportunity to expand its sphere of influence in China, and to gain recognition as a great power in postwar geopolitics.    Japan War dead figure of 415 is from a 1991 history of the Japanese Army. However, Michael Clodfelter reported the official toll was put at 300 KIA and noted that "A more reliable count of total Japanese military deaths from all causes lists 1,344 fatalities."Casualties reported by the US War Dept in 1924 were 300 killed.    Russian Empire total are 1,451,000 killed or missing in action and died of wounds. The estimate of the 1,811,000 total Russian military and 1,500,00 civilian deaths was made by the Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis.    United States The official figures of military war deaths listed by the US Dept. of Defense for the period ending Dec. 31, 1918 are 116,516; which includes 53,402 battle deaths and 63,114 non combat deaths. The US Coast Guard lost an additional 192 dead."

There is a good side to everything.  Looks like they used the "silver lining" part of the expression.  Trump probably means that the construction business is bad right now so you have to look hard for the good things in that industry.

If you look in the sky when there are dark clouds and the sun is shining from behind them, the edge of the clouds have a silver-like edge. To "look for the silver lining" means to not focus on the dark clouds in your life, but to find the edge of the cloud where the sun is shining. The Creed song is saying, to me, that sometimes the silver lining sometimes isn't enough, that you need the full sun sometimes.
Sk7ImPkMaa	Actually, there is a discussion about whether to eliminate the SAT IIs or not. However, until a major college system, such as the UCs or the Ivy Leagues, officially changes its admissions policies, in which case there would be an official announcement, you should assume that the SAT IIs are still required or strongly recommended at most of the top colleges.

xonA0547aa	the formula for a linear equation is: y=mx+b  m=the slope  so when you have an equation that's y=-5/9x + 20, y=y, m=-5/9, and b=20  thus, the slope is -5/9 :) whenever you have an equation like that, the slope is always the coefficient (the thing that multiplies) of "x".  hope i helped!|`|yKWPdilQaa	That's it. It's -5/9|`|AWFieviDaa	y=mx+b  m=slope  b=y intercept  and obviously y=y x=x  so the number or fraction before x is the slope.   in this case m=slope=-5/9|`|0QURsUu8aa	if youre just asking for the slope, its -5/9    and you need to first get numbers that your teacher gave you to plug in for x.    Ex:  if you had 9 for x, plug in 9 for the x in the equation    y=5/9*9+20 (the * is multiplying)    so  your answer would be y=25    ...and so on with the other numbers your teacher told in to plug in for x    i hope that made sense ;)

Mary is the antecedent of the personal pronoun, she.    The ring was lost when Mary accidentally flushed it down the toilet.  Ring is the antecedent of the pronoun it.

wObuU4uyaa	It's hard to show you how to do this through a computer, but I will do my best!  Hopefully you can figure out what I'm doing, I will put it step by step:    B)  1. 1/5y - 1/3 = y/15  2. y/5 - 1/3 = y/15  3. 3/3(y/5) - 5/5(1/3) = y/15  Get a common denominator...  4. 3y/15 - 5/15 = y/15  Multiple through for the common denominator.  5. 3y/15 - 5/15 - y/15 = 0  Get the variable on the same side by subtracting it from both sides.  6. 2y/15 - 5/15 = 0  7. 2y/15 = 5/15  8. 2y * 15 = 15 * 5  Cross-multiply.  9. 30y = 75  10. y = 5/2    C) I can't figure out what to do here because there is no equals sign, so it is not solvable, sorry!    D)  1. 0.1(Q + 80) + 0.2Q = 14  2. 0.1Q + 8 + 0.2Q = 14  3. 0.3Q + 8 = 14  4. 0.3Q = 6  5. Q = 20
0rWaKkySaa	The correct answer is "I."  The reason is that "you or I" is an appositive of the subject of the sentence, "who."  As such the pronoun must take the nominative case.    If that sounds a bit confusing, think of it this way - what the sentence is saying in effect is "You or I brought it."  You would not say "You or me brought it," now would you?|`|MINy26pjaa	The best way to figure out which to use is by answering the question you are asking.  Your question is "who bought it, you or (I or me)?.  If you answered that question you would say "I bought it", not "me  bought it".  Therefore the correct pronoun to use would be "I".      The same basic thing works even if there's not a question involved.  Say you want to know which is correct :    "He and I went to the store"  or "Me and him went to the store".  In a case like this, just make the sentence about one person instead of two.  So, would you say "he went to the store" and I went to the store", or would you say "me went to the store" and "him went to the store"?  If you break it up like that it becomes obvious which one is the right one.    So if you always make the sentence about one person instead of two people, it will be easy to tell which word is the right one to use.|`|ugRN86bYaa	I|`|TJzSdoJCaa	I think it depends on who you are asking the question too!   If you are talking to the person directly its you or me.  If your talking to someone indirectly its you or I.|`|YB6ZGaBWaa	In this case, Mom is right. The pronoun "me" is an object pronoun which means that it receives the action of the verb "bought." For example, you can say: Mom bought you and me a new toy. In your sentence, "I" is a subject pronoun which means that it performs the action. When you say: Who bought it, you or I? , you have to think about what you and I are doing. In other words, the pronouns "you and I" replace the "who". Who bought it? You or I bought it?   Although this is gramatically correct, it sounds weird because we are not used to speaking this way.|`|sjOelwhhaa	You or I is right.  Think of it this way:  Who=somone.  Someone  is either you or I.  I bought it or You bought it.    "You" or "I" or "Who" is the subject of the verb "bought."  Nobody would say "Me bought it."|`|mbXHkf1maa	"You or me".    Avoid people trying brain it out from scratch. In this context, "you or me" is perfectly normal English informal idiom (that is, phraseology that is not deducible from rules - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom ).    Examples from various modern texts on Google Books:    "You were under a strain? You! Who got locked upyou or me? Who got dosed with Thorazine you or me?" - Rebecca Jong, Fear of Flying .    "Now who's "My paleface brother Drooping Eyelid"? Eh? Who then, my friend, you or me ?" - Wolfgang Borchert, The Man Outside    "Who is the quickest to forgive, you or me?" - Stephen Arterburn, Fred Stoeker, Mike Yorkey, Every Man's Marriage.    "Who's the champ here, you or me?" - Jake La Motta, Joseph Carter, Peter Savage, Raging Bull: My Story    "Who screamed, you or me?" - D. Keith Mano, Take Five?    "Now I ask you, Walt, who's dishonest? You, or me?" - Leonard Sanders, The Wooden Horseshoe: A Novel?    The problem of 'who won: you or me' was tremendously important to him - Edgar du Perron, Country of Origin?    "H-ng it all, who's dying  you or me" - Amateur Sportsman, 1909    "Who Made the Magic Go Out of Our Marriage You or Me?" - James Thurber, The Thurber Carnival.

yJSPecgoaa	This has happened to my homeschooled children as well.  People who really don't know anything about homeschooling (even though they often think they do) are the ones most likely to be suspicious of it and think you're weird.    Also, people tend to be conformists.  They are therefore wary of those engaged in something outside "the norm."    In addition, the media seems to have advanced the notion that homeschooled children are "socially inept."  This idea, in turn, has been picked up by people who lack the sort of critical thinking skills that would prevent them from taking media talk as gospel.      Finally, some people are simply jealous.  Many children hate school and would love to not have to go.  When I took my children out of public school several years ago, so many of their friends confided in them that they envied them.  "You are sooooo lucky" is what my kids were told time and again.  Yet, people who are uncomfortable admitting their envy will simply be negative towards homeschooling.    Not to worry, though.  You ARE in fact lucky to be homeschooled.  It is a luxury most families can't afford.  If people are rejecting you merely for being homeschooled, they probably wouldn't be good friendship material anyway.  You certainly are not weird simply for being homeschooled!    Have a great day!|`|0lWB2SUwaa	Some homeschoolers I know are a socially akwward.

Not that this issue applies to you but school is the first place that usually notices abuse or neglected children. Some kids only get to eat when they are at school. The other issue is that public school teaches you social skills. Having to interact with many of your peers even some you do not like is a valuable life lesson that you will inevitably use your whole life.|`|AA11276208	Because they think we are hermits who never leave our houses.  And that we are shy and don't have friends.  Which I don't understand.  I have tons of friends.  People are just dumb and judgmental.  We home schooled kids are awesome! :)|`|huC4Vee0aa	People are afraid of the unknown. Up until recent years, most people were home schooled. Some of the most famous, most inventive, brightest people were Home schooled. While most people home school properly, even using accredited curriculums and certified teachers to grade tests, a few do not and  thus abuse the privilege. Usually it is these who make the news and the media runs with people's fear. Sometimes the reasons are because these same individuals have done something wrong legally. However, haven't some in the public school system also abused their authority? YES! So a open minded and thinking person would at least consider that (1) health reasons may exist, (2) their public school is failing the students and not passing basic tests and they wish their child do better (3) a public school or student may be abusing their authority or relationships (4) CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN NOT TO SOCIALIZE and much of social activities even in public school take place after school. Home schoolers can do that as well. Many who choose to home school can even join their public school to do these activities (or other classes if they do not wish to do all). Home schoolers can and do join other home schoolers for social networking and join for field trips, classroom learning, craft & art classes, and music classes. They are not socially neglectful in any way. If anything because they are judged prematurely I've found parents who homeschool tend to ENSURE social activities where public schoolers are ASSUMED to have done so already. Home schoolers are often better socially as they can relate to not only their peers but also adults ...which may be "weird" to public schoolers...who tend to think of adults as the enemy. We know many public schooled children who are completely introverted and do not seem to relate to anyone because of not being socially accepted at their public school. This can lead to horrible acts like the Columbine Killings. Some of these socially odd kids IF THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE at home schooling may not have dropped out, gotten into bad behavior, had the self-esteem to function later on.|`|YUg1BCaHaa	People (especially teenagers) are scared of what they don't know. They like to pick out people who are different and make them feel small. I know, this is one of the stupidest things EVER and it took me along time to get over what everyone was saying about me because I'm home schooled. But you know what? The truth is that they're totally jealous. I mean, in their eyes, we've got it great. We get to sleep in, we get to stay in our pajamas if we want, a lot of us get done with school early, etc. They want what we have, and most of them can't have that so they'll make it look like they have the upper hand...even though in reality they would give anything for what we've got. What I've learned, is to always act like you've got it got together, even if you don't. If you're struggling with home schooling and they see that they will pick you apart. But if you act like you're having the time of your life, they'll feel stupid for teasing you.  I hope I helped!!

2ynhPyh8aa	You need to tell a staff member. You could talk to a trusted teacher, guidance counselor, or principal. If I were you, I would rather have him lose his job now than do something horrible to make students suffer. He should not be talking about this stuff with the students. He is emotionally abusing you guys and this has to stop. Please tell someone before it gets worse. This man seems like he is emotionally/mentally sick and shouldn't be around many minors at once. Since he talks about horrible things like this, it sounds like maybe he wants to do one of these horrible things one day. Help yourselves and your classmates before it is too late. Tomorrow at school, during your free time (before school, lunch, study hall, after school, etc. etc.) you NEED to go see the counselor or principal and tell him or her about this problem. If you do not want to go alone, have as many other classmates as you like go see the principal or counselor and you could all testify against him. I will keep you all in my prayers and good luck!|`|CfRQYKEyaa	Well I know you don't want your teacher to lose his job, but what he is doing is HIGHLY inappropriate. You need to talk to someone about this, perferably your principle, someone who is in a position above his. This is very important. He is being very creepy and just because he is not doing anything physical right now doesn't mean he won't. It is very much against the rules for him to swear at or around you. It is illegal for him to be treating you and your classmates this way. Get help. If not for yourself, for all the others he could harm if he isn't stopped before it gets out of hand. By the way, I am sorry about you having to go through abuse, I have been there. I was abused by my step father for 7 years, you are not alone.|`|XqXlfev1aa	Have you told your teacher about the abuse.

I've learned that making a 'living' is not the same thing as making a 'life..'    I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.

I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one.    I've learned that every day, you should reach out and touch someone.

AA10251481	Everything depends on the state you wish to teach in.  Some states require a specific program of study (college undergrad credits) to obtain teaching credentials.    Other states require only a bachelors degree (from an accredited college) and passing a subject-area test.  The test will probably also include some "how to teach" questions.  You could probably learn some of that information by taking an "Intro to Ed" class at a local community college.     So - you need to contact your state department of education and determine what is required for a person with a bachelors degree to be certified to teach.    Teaching art (or anything else, for that matter, especially to younger children) is more about TEACHING and less about art.  Before taking this plunge, I would suggest that you volunteer with the art teacher at the local elementary school for a few days, and even do some substitute teaching.  That should give you a real good idea of what the career entails.    Best of luck to you.|`|AA11251285	Read this:  http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos069.htm    The traditional route to becoming a public school teacher involves completing a bachelors degree from a teacher education program and then obtaining a license. However, most States now offer alternative routes to licensure for those who have a college degree in other fields. Private school teachers do not have to be licensed but still need a bachelors degree. A bachelors degree may not be needed by preschool teachers and vocational education teachers, who need experience in their field rather than a specific degree.    Contact your State Department of Education:  http://www.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/i...|`|zrNHDbR0aa	It depends on where you are living and what the program requirements are at the University you want to attend for teacher's college. If you want to teach art to small kids, you just need a bachelor's degree. If you want to teach to older grades (high school) you will need very specific requirements as laid out by the teacher's college you apply to - such as a certain number of art classes (not a prob if you already have a BFA), but you will also need a second "teachable".     Getting a teaching certificate is NOT the same as a master's degree. An MFA (Master of Fine Art) is normally an intensive two year program that will lead you to a degree that should let you teach university level art courses. You cannot teach grade school with a master's degree alone - you must have a teachign certificate to do that.    The process for each of these is ARDUOUS and LONG and very competitive. You should be prepared for this.

You turn the percentage into a decimal fraction and multiply. c/100 * b = a    Third case is to divide the 56 by 0.64 to get your answer. a*100/c=b     I've shown these also as algebraic forumlas where a= the part, b= the whole, and c= the percentage.|`|bb5b205486e5b2da7edb771316be6f05aa	x/100   = 18/25    x = 18*100/25  = 72%  -------------------------------------  67 *  42/100  = 67 * 0.42   -------------------------------------  x * 64/100   = 56  x = 56 * 100 /64
inZ9CWBiaa	You need to check with the school if they have a dress code for teachers. You should dress in a similar way to your mentor teacher.

Whether you like it or not, people will judge you based on your appearance.  You need to dress in a similar manner as the teachers at the school.  You don't have to spend a lot of money- go to the Goodwill, etc.  I have seen several student teachers passed up for jobs because their appearance was seen as not professional or fitting in with the school's atmosphere.

46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	The trick with factoring trinomials like the one in your question is to find two numbers that, when multiplied, equal the -45, but when added equal the 4.  (Note, this would be different and more complex if the beginning were say 2a^2, but for now this explanation suffices).  Here, the numbers are plainly 9 and -5.    Sooooo, here it is.    a^2+4ab-45b^2  (a+9b)(a-5b)    However, don't take my word for it, do the FOIL.    First:  a*a = a^2  Outside:  a*(-5b) = -5ab  Inside:  9b*a = 9ab  Last:  9b*(-5b) = -45b^2    Thus, we have a^2 - 5ab + 9ab - 45b^2 or a^2 + 4ab - 45b^2.  It looks like we did it right.    Having factored the trinomial, we have two factors.  (a+9b) and (a-5b).  It looks to me like C is your answer.    Good luck the rest of the way.

Are the classes extracurriculars or required?     Can you tell me about your college counseling program?    What is your class schedule like -- is it block scheduling or regular daily classes?    Be sure whatever you ask wasn't just answered by the interviewer a few minutes before. = )    Don't worry about the interview, it's not a big deal, really. My son has done a couple recently at very competitive private schools and he said they weren't bad at all. The counselor at his private K - 8 had told the kids that they shouldn't be worried about their interviews, but none of them believed her. Now that they've all been to some, they know it's true. The school just wants to be sure that you're not like Patrick Star of Bikini Bottom, if you know what I mean. = )    Good luck!|`|kCPEAeFeaa	Ask about after school programs, like sports and clubs, and about arts programs. You can also ask about the languages they offer, and what classes students take in general. A good question is to ask about the student to teacher ratio. In my experience though, the kids don't have to ask a lot of questions, but just listen to the tour guide talk (if you're going to take a tour) and answer the questions the interviewer asks.

The English requirement will probably be one course in college composition and one course in analysis of literature.    Some colleges will require an information literacy or technology intensive course.    Those science courses will require a lab.    Some majors specify the level of math requirement.

That is why you have chosen a specific major. Now what I can tell you is Liberal Arts is a major that does NOT have a theme like every other major.      What I mean by "Theme" is that when you choose a specific major (math major for example) you have one of many different themes that you can choose to take. All that is .. is since your major is so concentrated on one particular subject you have to have other classes Integrated with your major to make you a well rounded individual. This is so you're not just knowledgeable in math, but other subjects as well.    The reason why Liberal Arts does not have a theme is because that major delves into all subject areas (math, English, science, arts, etc.)  Lastly, what is so ironic about the whole situation is... when you're undecided on a particular major in which to enroll, it's geared toward Liberal arts because all of your G.E. (General education) courses skim all subjects areas.    Hope I answered your question. LOL   Take care and have a nice night.

Usually they include:  -1 semester math  -1-3 semesters English  -1-2 semesters History  -1-2 semester foreign language  -1-2 semesters social science (psych, sociology, media studies)  -1-2 semesters of science    Some schools have no core, but they are the exception.

Not to mention very close proximity to co-ed schools, and you can take classes there for free that automatically transfer (Amherst, Hampshire, UMass Amherst).      Don't worry about the distance - even students who live nearby, and there aren't too many of them (students come from all over the world to attend Smith) don't go home every weekend, mostly just Thanksgiving and xmas.  Nearby Hartford airport includes Southwest, which often has very cheap flights all over the country, so it's not expensive to fly home once in a while - and the campus will be full all weekend anyway.  Not to mention they have a huge endowment (over 1 billion dollars) so they can offer a lot of financial aid.|`|HJbqA4hkaa	Work on your mom, Sweetie, you're almost an adult and she needs to let go and let you see the world.

Some advice for you is, maybe when your at school go to talk to a counsellor or make an appointment with a doctor and ask if u can talk to them about whats is happening in your life.  You sound like you may need a break from your friends and family...is there a family member you can go stay with for awhile that you can trust and talk to....there are hotlines you can call who can give you leads to various groups that can help you through bad times.  Maybe say a prayer and ask god to help you out, to guide you in the rigth direction....Im sorry your going through this, and I hope you go talk to someone soon.    good luck stranger|`|jKdVtDx7aa	I would talk to a friend, guidance counselor, clergyman. teacher or anyone to help.

"Show don't tell" kinda thing...not that I really know what that means besides don't tell us straight out what is going on..innuendos or something. XD But anyway...prehaps like I tell my friend who also writes poems try writing without using " I " or "you" or any person refernce straight out. It will, on most occassions, make a drastic change in the writting and cause it to be more original since you can't just start a line with " I " or "you".

I know I did and I'm not quite sure I ever really outgrew it.

I promise.  You had some strong feelings and you wanted to get them out.  I think it was misconstrued because it sounds a bit like you mean you want         in your line 'when I go no one will care', because it sounds like you're saying 'after i kill myself, you won't care'. Or in the line 'i do not know how life would be' though you mean you wonder what people will think when you die, it sounds like you're saying 'i will never know how my life would've turned out'.  You're NOT emo.  Emo is a slang word used to mean suicidal, though it actually stands for emotional.    This is a beautiful poem written by a beautiful person with a heart and a soul. I admire you. You were brave in showing that to people, and true to yourself by not getting rid of it. People should look up to you. Pleace ignore all the rude comments people give you because you REALLY don't deserve it. You're a wonderful person.

It's just a poem about death. Depends on how you look at it. You could be depressed, angry, just writing a random poem, doing this for fun, etc. If you find them calling you emo, don't give a **** about them. I used to like a guy, and once, I wore a purple sweater and he called me emo. I mean like, what the hell? Sure, I do have some hair covering my face, but that doesn't mean I'm emo! Emo is like, you cut yourself, you're all depressed, basically, you're always alone and probably unapproachable 'cause of how you look like and how you act. I sometimes feel like your poem. :) By the way, great poem. :D Like, seriously.    P.S.: Emo is a word. It's short for emotional.|`|NLAek2bJaa	Unfortunately... not to be mean.. but emo is short for emotional and your poem there just proved it. Emo is the new style where everyone is depressed!!!|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	Well, for someone that has discovered what hate is you sure are sensitive to the words of complete strangers. Simply put, you are fixated on death and darkness. You seem to be under the impression that life is but a nightmare.

I'm sure there's some girl around that is just a goddess to you so go with me on this analogy.  Every time you see her, you are just blown away...she almost seems untouchable. How do you get to her level of social status?  The truth is she's just like you..probably exactly like you.  The only difference is she isn't wasting her time trying to figure out how to be noticed.  She is just being her, and people notice her for that.  That's the kind of person you should strive to be.

If you dont know how to drive yet then you need to have lessons with your parents or a driving school BEFORE taking the driving test. You are not ready for a test.  If you take a right turn you go to the lane on the right side of the road. If you take a left turn you turn into the right lane or right of the median (thing in the center of a divided highway).

AA10566881	I agree with the previous grammar and spelling tips.  One task I might set for one of my students would be to ask whether you could change the first paragraph such that it isn't about you, but about the school district and how you will put your qualifications to work FOR the district.  For example, you could do your (pretend) homework on the district and find out that it is award-winning or something else stellar and describe how you would support the continuation of those achievements.    In short, potential employers don't want to know about you so much as they want to know what you will do for them.  Make sense?

AA11276208	Go to a community college and take a few classes there.  And maybe try a homeschool co op if you are not in one already.  I do both of those things and I feel very prepared for college life.|`|DshFTbcsaa	I think going to a "normal" high school is a important part of development. There you will get to interact with a wide group of people, from all different back rounds. Being home schooled your whole life isn't a bad thing, you just miss out on the interaction and exposure to different ideas and people.     Public school education is fine, and if you are going to college your mom won't be there to assist in anything. This will help greatly with the transition from high school to college not to mention help with the getting to know people. I think you really miss out on a lot if you are home schooled rather then having the opportunity to go to a public school. Meeting new people, with different ideas, worldviews, etc is important for you learning to think for yourself.     -Hope high school goes well for you!
jQjhIJzHaa	This is a cubic function, so a straight factor is hard.      You are told that one of the roots (actually zeros) is  6.  This is what f(6)=0 means.  You can factor out (x-6) from f(x) and you are going to end up with a quadratic.    f(x)=(x-6)Q(x)    How do you get Q(x)?  You divide f(x) by (x-6).  Q(x)=f(x)/(x-6)      Using synthetic division    6|1 -5 -12 +36         6   6   -36  -------------------     1  1   -6   0    So Q(x)=x^2+x-6.    This means f(x) can be factored as follows    f(x)=x^3-5x^2-12x+36    f(x)=(x-6)(x^2+x-6)    You can now factor  Q(x) easily because it is a quadratic    f(x)=(x-6)(x+3)(x-2)    So the roots of the function are 6, -3 and +2  Or  f(6)=0  f(-3)=0  f(+2)=0|`|O4oCqaKkaa	6, -3 and 2

tX4RNX1faa	Your thoughts come from the outside part of the brain thought of meaning with depth and humility or humanity are from your own trials and tribulations. Selling excitement to students must be real and if these experiences aren't yours they aren't real (to them) Look deeper into news stories, hear what is being held back sometimes it takes being cynical to a point. Try to look back about every book you ever read and write a one paragraph book report about it and within those memories will come the insight to your own thought provoking stories. I can talk about camping, fishing, skateboarding, surfing, baseball, basketball, football and teaching along with cooking, writing, poetry, reading, movies, wars and history with almost anyone. Pick any subject that you are excited about and within all the research you do on that subject, you will find hundreds of stories waiting to be discussed. But it is my thought that unless it means something to you it won't be perceived by any grade aged students as exciting to them unless you can genuinely act as if it is very exciting while explaining it to them for their comprehension and discussion purposes.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	Urbanmythsandlegends.com?|`|AdIrjmV7aa	You will be so boring and no one will listen to you or understand you.

AA10023710	I think that Boston has a better student life - more students, more colleges, more student-focused activities - while NYC has a better overall nightlife. But it really depends on what you like to do. Boston's scene is a bit more focused on pubs, while NYC's is more focused on bars/clubs. It's a different vibe.     You should probably visit schools in both cities, and see which city suits you best, personally.     In terms of advertising, you can actually do really well in either city. Although NYC-metro has more big agencies, those in Boston are very well respected.

"Reputable Company\modeling agencie?"    Geograpically your on the ground there to do the research however Las Vegas experience taught me that the "Trade Shows" create a need for models.    One avenue may be the Trade and Convention shows; reverse engineer from the purchaser to the agencie that they may be using in the cities your interested in working.    Example: Dewares Scotch is part a single malt Scotch Convention:'  You would contact Dewares Directly to their marketing Department asking which agencies they are going to use for their entertainment and staffing for the convention.  Be certain to get the marketing reps first and last name then use this name when contaction the agency they have informed you they are using.    Pull your resume showing you in a Kilt preparing to do a sword dance and "Bob's your Uncle" submit the resume to both the cliente and a possible follow up to the cliente you've already spoken to.

They believed that since Germany lost, they had to pay reparations to the winning countries.    3.

It wasn't allowed a big enough army to defend itself.    2, The allies pushed Germany into the treaty of Versailles, because Germany still had a chance of winning WW1, it still would have taken a very long time to defeat Germany and would have cost a lot of lives and money to take Germany (if they could) so they told them to sign the treaty of Versailles wile there moral was down to save themselves a prolonged war and millions of lives and possible defeat. (Germany still had a chance to win WW1)    3, Yes, but also many Germans Including Hitler thought that the German army had been stabbed in the back, and that it could of won WW1 had the treaty not been signed, the treaty meant that Germany would have to pay a lot and give much of its land away, which meant Germans were living in Germany were no longer part of Germany if they lived in the areas of land given away to the surrounding country's. This infuriated many germans including Hitler who thought that this treaty crippled Germany and meant it could never be great as long as it obeyed this treaty, When Hitler came into power, he ignored it all.    The treaty also caused the Invasion of the rhur (industrial part of Germany) by the French, because Germany could make there payments in time to france (Germany couldnt put up much of a fight against the french army because its army was tiney due to the treaty wich didnt alow them to have a big army), so Germany paid the German workers in the Rhur (many many Germans) to go on strike, it had to prink more money, this lead to Hyper Inflation (there money becaoming worthless, you needed basket fulls of notes to be able to effor one loaf of bread, this made the Germans hate it even more. It also meant that they wanted drastik change, So started voting for right and left wing parties, such as the Nazis and Communists. This led to Hitler becaoming Dictator of Germany who caused WW2 wich cuased the death of over 70 Million people worldwide and killed Millions in the Holicost.

2HETgiwgaa	As well as AUT, there are numerous others, including:    Aoraki Polytechnic (Timaru), Otago Polytechnic (Dunedin -  we have some great local fashion labels, so it's a great place to study), Southern Institute of Technology, Nelson Marlborough Institute of Tecnhology (Nelson is where New Zealand's World of Wearable Art started - the competition is now in Wellington, but I'm sure Nelson will still have a vibrant fashion scene), Design and Arts College of New Zealand (Christchurch), Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, Northland Polytechnic     I've included the link to the New Zealand Qualifications Authority website page where you can search for courses and qualifications - enter the word "fashion" in the search field - that should give you a pretty complete list of recognised courses.  You can find contact details for the various fashion colleges by clicking on the links within the results page.    As for fees structure, they will vary a bit.  But - two examples as an indication (all fees are for 2009 and in NZ$):    Otago Polytechnic (Bachelor of Design (Fashion) - 3 year course: for Domestic students (New Zealand citizens and others who qualify to pay domestic fees): $5,470 Year 1 and 2, $5,074 Year 3; International students annual indicative fee: $17,600 per year    Design and Arts College (Diploma of Fashion Design (Advanced) - 3 year course - Domestic students $5,385 - $5,410 per year; International students: $13,500 per year + course related costs of $2,200 - $2,500 - see the link to their fee schedule (the second www.dac.ac.nz link below) for other costs    In Australia - you could try Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Fashion, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) School of Fashion and Textiles, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Fashion and Textile Design, University of New South Wales (UNSW) Textiles and Fashion, and Whitehouse Institute of Design.  I didn't find any fee info - but if you start at the last link below and scroll down to "Fashion and textiles education" - you'll find links to those colleges.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Fashion courses in textile design, etc, etc are at AUT (Auckland University of Technology).

If you're from overseas they fee's will be much higher for you as they make the fee's much higher for international students, that's if you're allowed to study at all as after all our Universities are predominantly for New Zealanders.    http://www.aut.ac.nz

Atticus wont teach them how to shoot, but he does give them one rule to follow.    Atticus said to Jem one day, "I'd rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."    "Your father's right," she said. "Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird." (10.7)    So, mockingbirds are harmless, innocent creatures, and killing them is wrong, because they dont hurt anyone.

rlKZ40fZaa	Hi:    What you have here is not too bad; in fact, I quite like what you have written.    (Don't listen to others if they say you have not punctuated your sentence correctly.)     You have a nice emphatic simple sentence to begin with which is the topic of conversation for the rest of the paragraph.     What I would recommend, however, is that you change the tense of the verbs.    The use of the coordinating conjunction, along with the comma, joins the two independent clause together well, so I would not change this 'yet' to a transitional expression like another post suggested.      Here is how I would write it:    Life has been like a roller coaster this past year. One moment I'm at the top, feeling on top of the world, yet the next moment, I'm plummeting to the bottom.    (I have omitted a few words as they are either redundant or unnecessary.) Now, the sentences seem to flow better and are shorter in length.     I have also changed a couple of words. I changed peak to top so that it is the opposite of bottom, which you used later in the sentence, and I changed second to moment as it sounds better.    Perhaps, you could use a different coordinating conjunction; you could try 'but' or 'and' instead of 'yet.'    Here is another alternative you may prefer:    Life has been like a roller coaster ride this past year. One second I'm at the top, feeling on top of the world, and the next thing I know, I'm plummeting to the bottom.     Or,    Life has been like a roller coaster ride this past year: one second I'm at the top, feeling on top of the world; however, the next thing I know, I'm plummeting straight to the bottom.      But what you have is a good paragraph.    If you need further help, you can email me.|`|iJxGAaASaa	after world, you might consider putting in a semi-colon instead.  Or, you can put a period and make the next part a sentence.    maybe instead of "yet next thing I know," you can say, "then all of a sudden I'm plummeting all the way to the bottom."  (I omitted "down" because it's kind of redundant if we already know you're going to the bottom)|`|5jfzvw7oaa	I would change "yet" to suddenly....not bad otherwise.
933XLRGCaa	I'm actually a college student, so I probably can't be of much help to your survey, but I just thought I'd share my opinion. Some of these books I read for school, and some of them I read on my own:    The Giver by Lois Lowry:  A great book that explores alternative societies.     Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli: Looks at race and social class issues through an age-appropriate and compelling story.    Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry:  A story about the south during heavy segregation. Crucial for historical understanding.     The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton: About gangs, family, and sacrifice.

If you immerse a hot glassware into cooler water, the sudden trasition of temperature, will cause the glass to crack or break completly.  It's best to let glassware cool before you immerse in water or touch with a cold cloth or sponge.    3.

AA12095483	To a degree, yes, because everyone comes from a different background and draws on different life experiences. The degree of bias can range from minuscule to overwhelming and it is up to the person hearing or reading a discussion to determine what the degree of bias is. You are correct in stating that a simple preference isn't part of a bias. It's just that - a preference. But when you are asked to give an opinion on a subject, that's when bias enters the picture. In most cases it is perfectly unintentional, and most people don't even realize they do have biases. But they do!   I am biased, for example, about questions that are couched in poorly spelled words and ungrammatical sentences. Some of the questions are perfectly valid, but I have bias that leads me to believe that if the questioner can't be bothered to express his or her question in a grammatically sound manner, with properly spelled words, he or she probably isn't going to listen to my response or even be interested in what I have to say. They brand themselves as lazy thinkers. And I also feel that if they can't be bothered to ask their question correctly, why should I bother about an answer?  I have other biases, but that's the one that is most pertinent to this discussion. I know, there is a touch of elitism in that - and recognizing that, I usually DO respond to those poorly couched questions. But it still bugs me.|`|AA11842267	idk sorry|`|stHol8ITaa	Yes. You hit the nail on the head, opinions only come from experience and emotion, therefore, of course it's biased.    And a "preference" and a "opinion" are both biased, yes.|`|J3iBuHAHaa	Everyone likes and dislikes different thing, making us all unique, and unfortunately, all biased.     watch American History X.  there's one example.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	That's a good question.    I guess you're right when saying every opinion is biased, but sometimes opinions have merit in regards to facts or truth behind the opinion (the decision that got that person to give that opinion).    Sometimes research can be biased even though it is all facts that were gathered together.    If you want to learn more about it look at research people have conducted, especially sociological research.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Yes, for it is an opinion.

Opinions are influenced by bias to varying degrees because they require interpretation, whereas a fact doesn't require any interpretation (London is the capital of the United Kingdom).|`|NcKnqPtMaa	yes every opinion is biased    unless your quoting the opinion of someone else    bias is having a prejudice against something    if you were to say you like apple pie better than pumpkin pie then you have a positive prejudice toward apple pie and a negative prejudice toward pumpkin pie.|`|CAfpMvmgaa	theoretically "i like apple pie better than pumpkin pie" could be and opinion, preference or a bias...     hahaa, i know i am not helping. sorry LOL|`|dx84UNrvaa	bias=opinion without one another they don't exist|`|XeVQcVgQaa	Your question blew my head off.

Also, tell her that no, you are not ungrateful, but actually very, very grateful for all the hard work she has done to educate you, but that you want the experience of being in public school for your social and emotional development.  Ask her what her concerns are and tell her that after one year in public school, you'll sit down with her again and discuss how well yoU're doing in public school and re-visiT whether these concerns have been addressed, If P.S. IS NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU, TELL HER YOU'LL RE-CONSIDER AFTER TRYING IT FOR JUST ONE YEAR.

oEYXLeSpaa	Well it's no surprise they are similar, two of Kennedy's writers helped write Obama's speech.      Firstly, and most importantly, the world in 2008, as it did in 1961, finds itself torn in a struggle between two dominant ideologies that threatens to tear apart the very fibers that bind humanity together. In 1961, the great battle being waged was the one between two economic systems  Capitalism and Communism. In 2008, the battle at hand is a struggle between two sets of values  Western vs. Islam.    Obama addresses the poor people of the world, as Kennedy did, saying that Americans can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our bordersthe world has changed, and we must change with it. Perhaps the Obama Administrations seeming embrace of diplomacy and foreign aid will help fulfill Kennedys promise: to those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required.    And finally, Both Presidents acknowledged the major part America would play in future generations.       I hope this helped if you heave any further questions, email me. :)|`|crr4nACaaa	Change? lmao

ghaQgTLIaa	"One of the most important and generous benefits a company can offer is a college tuition reimbursement program, a contractual arrangement between employer and employee that outlines specific terms under which the employer may pay for the employee's continuing education. Today, tuition reimbursement benefits are also called tuition assistance, and vary greatly from company to company.    It generally takes a solid, well-established company to be able to offer what could amount to $10,000 per semester or more for eligible employees. So don't look for too many startups to include tuition assistance as a regular part of their compensation package. However, distance learning technologies are providing new opportunities for employees to receive degrees from virtual (and nonvirtual) universities at much lower cost than traditional study programs."

AA11545874	Every microwave oven contains a magnetron, which generates microwaves at just the right frequency to interact with the molecules in food and heat it directly.    All wave energy changes polarity from positive to negative with each cycle of the wave. In microwaves, these polarity changes happen millions of times every second. Food molecules - especially the molecules of water - have a positive and negative end, in the same way a bar magnet has a north and a south pole. When microwaves at the right frequency bombard food, they cause the polar molecules to rotate at the same frequency, millions of times a second. All this agitation on the molecular level creates friction, which heats up the food. Because microwaves don't interact with molecules of glass, plastic or paper, only the food is heated.|`|a91427c03d8819ed909ee3dd464c36d0aa	Okay... so the food in tne microwave, whether its a cup of coffeed ora frozen TV dinner, contains water.

Good luck!|`|AA11374612	I believe rapidly moving molecules would cause friction which generates heat.

Start with zero. Add a negative 5 (like owing money) and you have negative 5. (you're 5 in the hole). Do it again, and you owe 10. So -5 twice is -10  The same is true for subtraction. If you "take away" debt (negative numbers) You move in a positive direction. Subtracting two debts of 5 would put you ten up. Taking away would be considered times -1, so doing it twice would be -5 x -2 = 10|`|73a570039b9e63e738f43ec1a63c0a86aa	no one will ever kno, its just one of those stupid things math "geniuses" created to confuse the rest of us, just as the mathematical letter "i", which equals the squre root of -1, which doesn't exist.  just one of those memorizing things i guess.|`|7acb5e68197fad87271b9ca541ad1417aa	when u figure it out u tell me!

Service provision has been defined as an economic activity that does not result in ownership, and this is what differentiates it from providing physical goods. It is claimed to be a process that creates benefits by facilitating either a change in customers, a change in their physical possessions, or a change in their intangible assets.    By supplying some level of skill, ingenuity, and experience, providers of a service participate in an economy without the restrictions of carrying stock (inventory) or the need to concern themselves with bulky raw materials. On the other hand, their investment in expertise does require marketing and upgrading in the face of competition which has equally few physical restrictions.    Providers of services make up the Tertiary sector of industry.

AA11526235	Not everyone understands or learns in the same way, not everyone has the same life experiences to draw from, so literature gives us hundreds, if not thousands of examples to choose from.  There is also a saying about a picture being worth a thousand words and artists use them to express their ideas, what they see and think.  Both literature and art are recordings from the past which may show us problems and solutions and happenings which may still affect us today, so we might see what worked and what didn't and avoid some of the worse solutions suggested for a problem.  He who doesn't learn from history is doomed to repeat it.|`|O87D6zUCaa	Art and literature are important to the human race because they reflect a people's cultural heritage.

2253307a6cde390091d89f22e97b600daa	Yes, it's disturbing.  There are fundamental flaws in the funding of education.  Let's just swap the defense budget for the education budget and everything should work out fine.    It isn't just the schools.   My parents read to me, and encouraged us to read on our own.  Many U.S. parents now are quite lacking in providing any motivation for their children to learn.   If Mom and Dad don't read, chances are neither will the child.    I hate sounding like a conspiracy theorist, but it seems strange that our education system has been under-funded (by most professional opinions) for over 20 years now.   I just can't help but think that, "An ignorant populous is more easy to control", must have run through the minds of some of those in positions of power.|`|7e5d88fd6f33ddd913968d86193789acaa	i donts no wat u jawjabbinin bouts?  wtf if stu has a pbm with a''  /// on da www|`|AA11130775	Within each generation, language grows and evolves, for example, when I was younger 'wicked' meant extremely deviant, now it means the opposite - extremely brilliant.... there it goes again, brilliant is a degree of brightness in illumination terms as well as intelligence or knowledge levels.

I believe that people are so used to texting that the language is permeating all levels of society. It is an accepted 'shorthand', quicker to use...plus you don't need to remember or know all those complicated rules about grammar and sentence structure.

ca3b63e40aa9759641ed2dfd2df4ba9caa	I hope my answer is not as long as the one above!    'Unity is strength' are words from a poem by William Carrington.    Read it here:|`|ef231b1c09bc618f60b1a4c956c7c199aa	Unity of mind requires soaring above apparent differences. He sees farthest who ascends highest. Unity of mind does not mean we have to eliminate differences. Live with them and achieve unity, not uniformity, for uniformity goes against Creation.     Differences are a blessing as long as we respect and accept them; they activate and inspire the mind and acce-lerate the thinking process which leads to intellectualdevelopment. When differences are understood, they enrich us and lead to progress and deve-lopment.     When directed towards social problems, unity of mind results in common welfare and a united approach is an integrated approach as it helps us achieve love, peace and brotherhood. We have no choice but to work with people who are different than us.     When we accept that variety is the spice of life, we obtain unity despite differences. Peace can only be achieved by understanding and acceptance.     Unity is life; its negation is death. Unity is to be achieved through unity of minds. Our mind perceives and creates the world around us. Beauty, love, compassion, benevolence, reason and order help us embrace with equal ease all things great and small.     Unity is strength. Baha'u'llah, who spoke of the need for Oneness, said that so powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole of earth. Religion is to enhance love and unity, for we are fruits of one tree.     Those who make no effort to expand their process of thinking and improve their level of awareness generally have closed minds, they are not receptive to new ideas. Men may seem to get together but they remain divided by difference in perceptions.     Unity is best achieved when minds are elevated. At an average level of our consciousness all our differences get exaggerated and distorted. Higher the consciousness, the better the adaptability to unite.     Accept all religions and respect them as we respect our own religion. Living beyond one's own religion is the way to unity among religions. Peace is possible through dialogue. In dialogue we listen to other's viewpoints and by doing so we create meeting points between us and others.     Dialogue among religions foster mutual respect and deeper understanding of faiths. Listening provides opportunities for unity of mind that generates spiritual strength through love and compassion.     The pluralistic nature of Indian society poses a challenge to unity of ideas. How-ever, India has the capacity to assimilate differences even while respecting individual identities, firmly anchored on spiritual foundation.     When as individuals we develop elevated consciousness, the ego vanishes and our minds acquire receptivity to new ideas, that is, when closed minds become open minds. Even if we are convinced about our own viewpoints, we should remain open to the suggestions of others.     Our scriptures proclaim that the world is one family. We must live up to this dictum by expanding our thinking process to unite people not only in India but across the whole world.     We have to educate ourselves and realise that we are a part of a common existence and as such we must achieve Oneness to gain strength      best of luck

Affirmation of the world -- that is affirmation of the will to live, which appears in phenomenal forms all around me -- is only possible for me in that I give myself out for other life.-Albert Schweitzer:    Love- "Love is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion. That is just being "in love" which any of us can convince ourselves we are.    Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.

V1Zje2KYaa	It's better than an invalid argument, but it has to be sound, too, or else people can just deny the premises.    Example:   This is an invalid argument:  All dogs are animals.  All cats are animals.  Therefore all dogs are cats.    The first two statements are true, but they do not prove the conclusion.    This is a valid, but unsound argument:  All antelopes are houses.  All houses can fly.  Therefore all antelopes can fly.    IF it were true that all antelopes were houses and that all houses could fly, then this would be a sound argument for proving that all antelopes could fly.  This is better than the first example, because here a person arguing with you can hone in on a specific disagreement they have with you (e.g. not all antelopes are houses, so I disagree) rather than with an invalid argument (where they can just say no, you're wrong.)|`|nCrSOm9vaa	Not necessarily.

uQTtwuT7aa	The number of possible roots a polynomial has is always the highest exponent. In the case of a parabola, the highest exponent is always 2, so it will have either two roots, one root (when the vertex is exactly on the x-axis), or no roots.     The first question specifies that it has two roots, so that is your answer, it crosses the x axis twice.     The second question is a little trickier. I factored the equation:  (x+2)^2     When that is set to 0, you can then solve for x:  (x+2)^2 = 0  x+2 = sqrt(0)  x = -2    This is a double zero, meaning it returns the same zero value multiple times, but actually only crosses the x-axis once, when x = -2. You can tell that it is a double zero when, in its factored form, the term in the parentheses is raised to a power.|`|RrvJ99uaaa	The Quadratic Formula can be used to find the actual value of the roots of this equation, if it does touch the x-axis.    To find the number of roots (x-intercepts), look at the discriminant of the equation, b^2 - 4ac. This value will provide information about the number and types of the roots.     a = 1, b = 4, and c = 4.     (4)^2 - 4(1)(4) = 16 -16 = 0. This value indicates that there are "double roots" or a point of tangency of the graph at the x-axis. The graph touches the x-axis at the point ( -2, 0) and the bounces back upward.    There is one unique root.

There are plenty of people in your school that can be very, very good friends. Get out of the disgusting bathroom and face the world.  Tomorrow, try finding those "friends" that you had and end the relationship some way or another.

After about a week, you will meet some of their friends, and then you will have a new little group.   Think outside the box. Someone you would NEVER have talked to if you were still hanging out with the populars.   besides, populars are not always that happy...   And making friends with guys is always a plus.

Talk to a school counselor about it. That's really the best choice; they've helped other kids with similar situations.  Just remember three things: 1. If those girls are so rude to you, you have no reason to worry about them. This -- making your school experience hell -- was their goal in the first place. Just ignore them and their comments and school will be a little better. 2. High school is essentially about grades, not social life. Studies show that kids (mostly girls) who are dealing with social drama make lower grades. Focusing on academics will help tune those girls out. 3. You don't have to make friends only at school! Join some forums or websites that interest you and form some friends there. (Just remember to be safe online, 'kay? ;])|`|2XI6n1Noaa	you can't make new friends sitting on the toilet.

You do need an education and if the social issues are distracting you from what IS important in school, you need to fix it.     You could just hold your head up high, and brush it off......    Take care of yourself. I hope you work it out.    Here are some links to virtual schools to check out.

I'm pretty sure that everyone isn't trying to avoid you. You're probably anxious and over paranoid about the situation. People don't really care if you hang out, just don't make it awkward. If they are saying bad things about you, then confront them. They might respect you for that.     -April
AA12397801	Get involved in after school activities.  Make your name be known so people would want to get to know you.  Start conversations with people. In the end the friends you make are sure to have more friends and you can get to know them as well.  =] Good luck at your new school.|`|iTTS06IKaa	Join clubs and introduce yourself - that way you can find people who share your interests, and a friendship can form from that!     Also, don't be afraid to say hi to people.   I've learned that people are a lot nicer than they seem.|`|deOxABCGaa	I had to do that last year because I hated my old school but my new school only had about half the amount of people. Just talk to people and there's usually at least one person who'll start talking to you or come up to you or something. You'll make friends soon enough.|`|Znw52fxkaa	Be interested in other people - ask them questions, find out about them.    People like to talk about themselves and you letting them is a way to both find out about them and make them feel good, it's a good way to make friends. The more talking they do when you first meet and the less you do, it's good. But don't let it stay that way forever because you shouldn't definately be able to talk just as much. But you asking them about their lives and what they do, they may then ask you the same question back!    But yes, as already said, join clubs - of talk to people in your class what they like to do if there's any extra curricular things, maybe try something new! Definately get involved in anything that you can.

AA11459417	If you don't want to go to school for a long time, you'd better rethink your plan to become a pediatrician (a doctor).  First of all, you have to really excel in science and math, so that's something to think about, too.  You'll have to get a bachelor's degree (4 years of college) in something like biology.  From there, you'll have to go to medical school, which is another 4 or so years.  In some cases, there will be another year or two of school after that when you'll study courses related solely to your specialty.  After that, there will be an internship and residency (another three [I think] years when you'll be required to work AND study).  Finally, after all that, you'd be able to practice medicine.  I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't do it, but you need to realize that there's A LOT more to becoming a pediatrician than loving babies and children.  If you want a career with children that doesn't require many years of schooling, maybe you should think about something like teaching (only 4 years of college required) or operating a daycare center.|`|ghaQgTLIaa	First you go to college for 4 years and major in some type of biology (normally). Then you got to medical school for two years and then another two years of residency(which is kinda like working because sometimes you get paid, but not really)|`|yfwSDroNaa	well its about 5-6 years of college (biology majors usually graduate in 5 yrs. trust me i know...im a bio major)  u dont have to major in biology though..u can take the required classes needed to enter the med school of ur choice but it will still take 5 yrs.  then there is med school which takes about 4-5 years  if u dont like school i dont suggest u to become a pediatrician..perhaps maybe a preschool teacher or kindergarten teacher instead its less time|`|cWfTvJTcaa	It takes a long time to become a doctor. In the United States, you will need 4 years of college, followed by 4 years of medical school. Then, after graduating medical school, you need to do your internship for one year and then residency, which is supervised training for three to seven years. Interns and residents are practicing doctors, they just haven't completely finished their education so they are supervised by licensed physicians (it's kind of on-the-job training). Then after that, you can become board-certified (which means you will get your license to practice) and can go be a doctor doing whatever you like (join a practice, open your own practice, work in a hospital, work in a clinic, etc.)|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Actually, you've got 8 years of school followed by at least 3 years of residency - 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of med school, and 3+ years of residency (more if you want to specialize further).  That's 11 years before you can get a job on your own.

It has to be something different and interesting for the students but related to the subject and that lesson. And i feel it should not be very time consuming.  for example if u r teaching a computer science student about  Java programming instead of asking them to write a monotonous program or an algorithm as home work u can ask them to write a love letter to their girlfriend using java programming....!!, a flow chart or an algorithm.... ha ha    see how creative it can be...........!!

More importantly, you can use your high school gpa to apply to another college and omit the more recently classes. It may cost you the recent credits.    Also, every college has a different policy. Make sure you get the right information straight from the adviser. And if its good new, get it in writing. If it's bad news ask a different adviser. They surprisingly often will tell you different information.    Good luck if you chose to go back.

Winfrey has stated that she was raped by her cousin, uncle, and a family friend. Despite her dysfunctional home life, Oprah skipped two grades (2nd and 8th?) and by the time she was thirteen received a scholarship to attend a prestigious all white high school in the suburbs. At age 14 her mother sent her to live with her father in Nashville, Tennessee. Vernon was strict but encouraging, and made her education a priority. Winfrey became an honors student. Winfrey would join her High School Speech Team, and she placed 2nd in the nation in Dramatic interpretation. She won an oratory contest which secured her a full scholarship to Tennessee State University, a historically Black institution, where she studied communications. At age 18, Winfrey won the Miss Black Tennessee beauty pageant.

ef231b1c09bc618f60b1a4c956c7c199aa	We began this chapter's investigation of distributive justice in order to consider the claim that a state more extensive than the minimal state could be Justified on the grounds that it was necessary, or the most appropriate instrument, to achieve distributive justice. According to the entitlement conception of justice in holdings that we have presented, there is no argument based upon the first two principles of distributive justice, the principles of acquisition and of transfer, for such a more extensive state. If the set of holdings is properly generated, there is no argument for a more extensive state based upon distributive justice. (Nor, we have claimed, will the Lockean proviso actually provide occasion for a more extensive state.) If, however, these principles are violated, the principle of rectification comes into play. Perhaps it is best to view some patterned principles of distributive justice as rough rules of thumb meant to approximate the general results of applying the principle of rectification of injustice. For example, lacking much historical information, and assuming (i) that victims of injustice generally do worse than they otherwise would and (2) that those from the least well-off group in the society have the highest probabilities of being the (descendants of) victims of the most serious injustice who are owed compensation by those who benefited from the injustices (assumed to be those better off, though sometimes the perpetrators will be others in the worst-off group), then a rough rule of thumb for rectifying injustices might seem to be the following: organize society so as to maximize the position of whatever group ends up least well-off in the society. This particular example may well be implausible, but an important question for each society will be the following: given its particular history, what operable rule of thumb best approximates the results of a detailed application in that society of the principle of rectification? These issues are very complex and are best left to a full treatment of the principle of rectification. In the absence of such a treatment applied to a particular society, one cannot use the analysis and theory presented here to condemn any particular scheme of transfer payments, unless it is clear that no considerations of rectification of injustice could apply to justify it. Although to introduce socialism as the punishment for our sins would be to go too far, past injustices might be so great as to make necessary in the short run a more extensive state in order to rectify them.

ef231b1c09bc618f60b1a4c956c7c199aa	Medicinal Plants     Plants have been used as healers and health rejuvenators since time immemorial. Even now, WHO recognizes that medicinal plants plays an important role in the health care of about 80 percent of World population in developing countries and depend largely on traditional medicines, of which herbal medicines constitutes the most prominent part (Fransworth et al. 1985). The rest of the 20 percent also depend substantially on the plant-based medicines.     Among the rich and varied plants of Indian forests the medicinal plants constitute an important source, the use of which for human and veterinary health care has probably continued, in an unbroken tradition for well over 2 millenium.     Many people have defined medicinal plants in many ways, out of which the accepted definition given by the Agricultural and Natural Resource Development is,                  Plants that are recognized by people to have reliable and effective medicinal values, are commonly used in treating and preventing specific ailments and diseases, and play an essential role in health care.     The number of medicinal plants in India, both indigenous and introduced has been estimated to be between 3,000 to 3,500 species of higher plants. The Glossary of Indian Medicinal Plants has listed around 3,000 plants (Asolkar et al., 1992; Chopra et al., 1956, 1974). Two thousand five hundred plants have been reported to be used in ethno-medicine (Jain, 1991). The number of plants listed in Ayurvedic Materia Nighantu is 560 in Bhav Prakash Nighantu (Kumar 2000). The Ayurvedic Drug Formulary prepared by Department of Indian System of Medicine, lists 387 plants (Sarin, 1996). The Unani system of medicine describes 440 plants (Said, 1969) out of which 360 are common to other systems practiced in the country. The number of plants having confirmed therapeutic properties or yielding a clinically useful chemical compound thus lies around 700 species. The occurrence of these medicinal plants and availability of raw materials from them is as follows:     ?  Plants occurring wild in forests, grasslands, aquatic and desert ecosystems, associated with other forms of natural vegetation.     ?  Plants growing as weed.     ?  Plants cultivated as ornamentals or as cereal, fruit, vegetable, spice, oil seed, essential oil or other cash crop.     ?  Plants cultivated as medicinal crop.     In addition, almost 25% of the entire compounds of current prescription drugs were derived originally from plant sources (Balandrin et al, 1985). Of the estimated 25,000 flowering plant species in the world today, only about 10% have been scientifically examined for their medical application, mostly in rudimentary way. Undoubtedly, many more plant-derived medicinal substances await discovery (Akerale et al. 1991). The information on the medical wealth of these examined 10% of plant species is scattered in different sources.     The Western Ghats is very rich in its medicinal wealth. The forests and hills of this region   is a treasure house of about 700 medicinal plants. Out of which some are used for traditional and folk medicinal practices. Many are exploited commercially for their active enzymes and their commercial value.     Medicinal plant species of Western Ghats represent a variety of life form ranging from lichen, algae, herbs, shrubs, climber and trees, which are annuals to perennials. Moreover these species are distributed from canopy to understorey and are characterized seasonally. The auto-ecology and syn-ecology of medicinal plant species is complex and their proper understanding requires a sound knowledge of the ecology, taxonomy and ethno-botany for these species. Western Ghats with its species diversity is a treasure house of different kinds medicinal plants.     The limited knowledge on the varied use of the medicinal plants, their availability and extent of distribution weakens the ways to utilize these resources efficiently. Therefore, it is required to bring the information in various sources into one roof.     Importance of medicinal plants     Medicinal plants are used at the household level by women to improve the health of the family members.   At the village level by medicine men or tribals   By the practitioners of classical traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, or the Japanese Kampo system.   Medicinal plants are gaining importance in the fields of research, especially in the field of genetics and biotechnology.   From the trade data available, it is clear that the global market for medicinal plants has always been very large. To give an example of the extent of trade volumes even at that time, according to one report commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature, the total import in 1980 of vegetable materials used in pharmacy by the European Economic Community was 80,738 tons (Lewington 1992). India was the largest supplier by far, with 10.055 tons of plants and 14 tons of vegetable alkaloid and their derivatives. It is also true that due to the rising international demand, many important medicinal plant species are becoming scarce and some are facing the prospect of extinction. Therefore it is important to conserve the extensively traded medicinal plants in its natural environment or cultivating it in favorable environments.     Out of the large variety of species available in the Western Ghats, about 50 species hold a very high value in the folk and herbal health forms for the treatment of different forms of ailments. The most common plants like the Mimosa pudica, Hibiscus angulosus, Leucas aspera, Phyllanthus neruri, Calotropis gigantea, Tridax procumbens, Parthenium hysterophorus (which is considered to be a noxoious weed) are all found to have cure for many major ailments like jaundice, asthma, piles, bronchial and blood disorders.

I think it is the same or worse than it was in the past if you look at it on a global scale. If you look at it by region, it may have decreased.     WIth the advent of new techonology, for example, the majority of 1st world countries are able to enjoy many more luxuries than before, but the poor and disadvantaged in many parts of the world, can still only dream of attaining such luxuries.     Additionally, the evaporation of the middle class in the world, I think is increasing the global inequality. The poor are poorer, he rich are richer...and since the proportion of poor is larger than the rich - the inequality has increased.

Here's the definition of affirmative action in general:    Affirmative action (U.S. English), or positive discrimination (British English), is a policy or a program of giving certain preferences to certain (usually under-represented) groups. This typically focuses on education, employment, government contracts, health care, or social welfare.    There is much debate concerning claims that it fails to achieve its desired goal, and that it has unintended and undesirable side-effects. There are also claims that the practice is itself racist or sexist.

You might then impatiently cut her off or try to complete the sentence for her.    Even more disruptive is interrupting her by saying that you with disagree her, but without letting her finish saying what it is that you think you disagree with. That's a common problem when a discussion gets heated, and which causes the discussion to degrade quickly.    By interrupting the speaker before letting her finish, you're essentially saying that you don't value what she's saying. Showing respect to the speaker is a crucial element of good listening.    The "knowing the answer" barrier also causes the listener to pre-judge what the speaker is saying -- a kind of closed-mindedness.    A good listener tries to keep an open, receptive mind. He looks for opportunities to stretch his mind when listening, and to acquire new ideas or insights, rather than reinforcing existing points of view.       2 - Trying to be helpful  Another significant barrier to good listening is "trying to be helpful". Although trying to be helpful may seem beneficial, it interferes with listening because the listener is thinking about how to solve what he perceives to be the speaker's problem. Consequently, he misses what the speaker is actually saying.    An old Zen proverb says, "When walking, walk. When eating, eat." In other words, give your whole attention to whatever you're doing. It's worth emphasizing that the goal of good listening is simply to listen -- nothing more and nothing less. Interrupting the speaker in order to offer advice disrupts the flow of conversation, and impairs the listener's ability to understand the speaker's experience.    Many people have a "messiah complex" and try to fix or rescue other people as a way of feeling fulfilled. Such people usually get a kick out of being problem-solvers, perhaps because it gives them a sense of importance. However, that behavior can be a huge hurdle to good listening.    Trying to be helpful while listening also implies that you've made certain judgments about the speaker. That can raise emotional barriers to communication, as judgments can sometimes mean that the listener doesn't have complete respect for the speaker.    In a sense, giving a person your undivided attention while listening is the purest act of love you can offer. Because human beings are such social animals, simply knowing that another person has listened and understood is empowering. Often that's all a person needs in order to solve the problems on his or her own.    If you as a listener step in and heroically offer your solution, you're implying that you're more capable of seeing the solution than the speaker is.    If the speaker is describing a difficult or long-term problem, and you offer a facile, off-the-cuff solution, you're probably forgetting that he or she may have already considered your instant solution long before.     3 - Treating discussion as competition  Some people feel that agreeing with the speaker during a heated discussion is a sign of weakness. They feel compelled to challenge every point the speaker makes, even if they inwardly agree. Discussion then becomes a contest, with a score being kept for who wins the most points by arguing.    Treating discussion as competition is one of the most serious barriers to good listening. It greatly inhibits the listener from stretching and seeing a different point of view. It can also be frustrating for the speaker.    .     4 - Trying to influence or impress  Because good listening depends on listening just for the sake of listening, any ulterior motive will diminish the effectiveness of the listener. Examples of ulterior motives are trying to impress or to influence the speaker.    A person who has an agenda other than simply to understand what the speaker is thinking and feeling will not be able to pay complete attention while listening.    Psychologists have pointed out that people can understand language about two or three times faster than they can speak. That implies that a listener has a lot of extra mental "bandwidth" for thinking about other things while listening. A good listener knows how to use that spare capacity to think about what the speaker is talking about.    A listener with an ulterior motive, such as to influence or impress the speaker, will probably use the spare capacity to think about his "next move" in the conversation -- his rebuttal or what he will say next when the speaker is finished -- instead of focusing on understanding the speaker.     5 - Reacting to red flag words  Words can provoke a reaction in the listener that wasn't necessarily what the speaker intended. When that happens the listener won't be able to hear or pay full attention to what the speaker is saying.    Red flag words or expressions trigger an unexpectedly strong association in the listener's mind, often because of the listener's private beliefs or experiences.    Good listeners have learned how to minimize the distraction caused by red flag words, but a red flag word will make almost any listener momentarily unable to hear with full attention.    An important point is that the speaker may not have actually meant the word in the way that the listener understood. However, the listener will be so distracted by the red flag that she will not notice what the speaker actually did mean to say.    Red flag words don't always provoke emotional reactions. Sometimes they just cau|`|dc1d5c97166f292e102471eb531738a2aa	Effective Listening & speaking is how you are able to communicate your thoughts with others as well as how you interpret other's thoughts .

In your case, when you have a fraction, you only need to look at what x-values make the numerator equal to zero (since 0/c = 0, so long a c is not 0) and that do not make the denominator 0.  In your example, the numerator can never equal zero, since any number squared is positive, and a positive number plus 3 is not 0.  So, f(x) has no x-intercept.  You can verify this by graphing f(x) on a graphing calculator or some other graphing device, and seeing that the graph of f(x) never crosses the x-axis.
ef231b1c09bc618f60b1a4c956c7c199aa	The Slave Dynasty (A.D. 1206-1920)  Qutbuddin is known as the founder of the slave or Mamluk dynasty. They were called slave-kings because three of its army Sultans themselves were slaves. They had risen and had earned great reputation for courage, fighting skills and organizational abilities. Qutbuddin Aibak was one such trusted slave-general of Muhammad Ghori.     After Ghori's death, Aibak set up an independent kingdom with its headquarters at Lahore and thus laid the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate. Except Qutbuddin, other sultans of this dynasty belonged to the Ilbari tribe of Turks. During his brief rule of four years Qutbuddin's entire attention was devoted towards strengthening his position and kingdom.     Qutbuddin was succeeded by Iltutmish. He made Delhi his capital. His reign is marked by his efforts in securing his throne from rivals, attacks by Chenghiz Khan and the Mongol hordes. Iltutmish organized his government and made several reforms. First, he organized the ruling elite or nobility of the period, which is better known as Turkan-I-Chahalgani or Calisa. Secondly, he divided his empire into numerous big and small pieces of land, called Iqtas. These Iqtas were assigned to the nobles and officers in lieu of salary. Thirdly, he introduced the silver coins called tanka and copper coins called jital, which were used during the sultanate period.     Iltutmish chose his daughter Razia as his successor instead of his son in view of her ability to become a ruler. She ruled for a short period and after her a number of less important sultans came to the throne.     Balban was another important ruler of the slave dynasty. He was known for his strong policies to consolidate his position as the king. Balban defended his kingdom from the Mongol invasions and from internal rebellions. He broke the power of Turkish nobility (Chalisa) that had become more powerful than the Sultan. He derived his concept of kingship from Persia. He called himself a shadow of god on earth and next only to the prophet. He encouraged people do sijdah in his presence, (they had to kneel and touch the ground with their forehead in salutation to him and do paibos, kissing the feet of the king). This was against the tenants of Islam.     for more imformation check out this link:    http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gazropr3.htm

Of its nearly 1 billion inhabitants, an estimated 350-400 million are below the poverty line, 75 per cent of them in the rural areas.      *          More than 40 per cent of the population is illiterate, with women, tribal and scheduled castes particularly affected.      *          It would be incorrect to say that all poverty reduction programmes have failed. The growth of the middle class (which was virtually non-existent when India became a free nation in August 1947) indicates that economic prosperity has indeed been very impressive in India, but the DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH has been very uneven.      *          The main causes of poverty are illiteracy, a population growth rate by far exceeding the economic growth rate for the better part of the past 50 years, protectionist policies pursued since 1947 to 1991 which prevented large amounts of foreign investment in the country.      *          Poverty alleviation is expected to make better progress in the next 50 years than in the past, as a trickle-down effect of the growing middle class. Increasing stress on education, reservation of seats in government jobs and the increasing empowerment of women and the economically weaker sections of society, are also expected to contribute to the alleviation of poverty.      *          Eradication of poverty can only be a very long-term goal in India.|`|9d68cb75cf1952ebd50dd12a26a8aaecaa	hey  who said india is poor we are not and i am proud to be a citizen of such a great country  if u want to make a project on india then make it on the corruption takeing place in india|`|AA12167948	try visiting websites of organisations like CRY or UNICEF....u'l get lotsa info thr and probably pics too. as both these orgs do a lot of work in india.    for the cover page: how bout having half the page with the pic of a comfortable kid(of any country) n on the othr half a pic of a poor kid in india of the same age, working or in othr povertystricken conditions.   don't superimpose the title on the pics...leave space so tht the pics come under the title.    use a lot of pics in ur project. it makes a good impresson and catches the eye.  if u need more help...jus ask me|`|AA10892488	Your exploiting the poverty in a country for your own needs.

AA11749081	Greed and selfishness are the causes.  What else can be the causes?  Leaders of those European countries want more land and money.  They want only their people to be wealthy and in power.  They want to use all the other people that they took advantage of to make more wealth and power for themselves.  (Hey, don't forget Japan was also involved in WWII.)    The consequences of those two wars are a lot of hatred between groups of people.  No one will ever forget the loss of a loved one being killed or the house that they've worked for all their lives being bombed and gone within seconds.  Wars destroy futures within seconds.  When stuff like this happens, some people don't forget which group of people or country did it to them.  So they teach their children and grandchildren how to hate the other group of people.

The rest of the world does not have the technology to resist, and learns that the only thing that can stop a European power is another European power.    1870 - Bismark begins unifying Germany into a nation and a European power.    1914 - Germany stretches too far, and the European powers have a (yet another) war to settle who runs the show.    1918 - WW1 ends.  Germany is forced by Britain and France to pay reparations and accept a stripped down military.  This leads to Germany going nearly bankrupt, and one man to say "this peace treaty hasn't ended the war; it's just postponed it for 20 years"    1929 - Stock market crash - worldwide economic depression.  Many nations look for alternatives, some even tinkering with the idea that capitalism doesn't work.    1933 - Hitler comes to power in Germany, and starts rebuilding the military.  He wants to end the reparation payments, and capture land and resources.    1939 - WW2 begins.    1945 - WW2 ends.      Results:     Most, if not all, of Europe's great cities are in ruins.    England and France are broken to the point of being unable to maintain their empires.  A period of decolonization begins.  Many African and South American countries gain independence over the next 30 years.    The US, being the only major power not to suffer major damage, becomes a world Superpower.    The USSR, with most of the cities east of Moscow still intact, becomes the other world Superpower.    The two superpowers split the world in half.    1989 - The USSR, bankrupt through decades of military spending and a lack of investment, collapses.    1990's - the US, rather than putting "the peace dividend" to good use, squanders the opportunity in a fit of isolationism, where news about Joey Buttafuco is given more airtime than news about the growing threat in Afghanistan.    9/11/01 - the 21st century begins.

AA10867415	Picture of Steven SneadSteven G. Snead is a Detroit native who has been a lifelong dedicated member of the community.  He is currently a Michigan Certified Teacher in the Detroit Public Schools system, teaching technology courses at the Detroit Technology High School at John J. Pershing High School. While at the Detroit Technology High School, the districts only technology based small learning community, Steven helped lead the schools efforts to become accredited by the North Central Association on the Commission for Accreditation and School Improvement. This accreditation framework helped the school graduate 99% of its seniors, all of whom were accepted to a 2 or 4 year collegiate program. He also helped lead the school to be a semi-finalist for the prestigious National Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence Award. For his efforts and passion for the children of Detroit, Steven was nominated by  his own students for the coveted Whos Who in Americas Teachers Award, twice.    But, teaching was not Steven Sneads first experience in serving the citizens of Detroit. Raised as a Boy Scout in Vernon Chapel A.M.E. Church and eventually earning the rank of Eagle Scout, he participated in numerous volunteer activities that have benefited countless children across the city of Detroit, including Toys for Tots, Project Cleansweep (later titled Motor City Makeover), the Special Olympics, Angels Night and much more. For his service, Steven received numerous testimonial resolutions from Michigan Legislators, Senators, and the Detroit City Council. He is also a recipient of the Spirit of Detroit award.                In addition to teaching and volunteer experience, Steven Snead has demonstrated his capacity for leadership as Director of Camp Dr. Burt R. Shurly, a resident camp owned by the Detroit Public Schools and operated by the office of Health, Physical Education and Safety. Serving as the camps Director for 4 years, Steven was the first Director to bring corporate volunteers and donations to the camp in order help improve the camps activity programs. In total, during his work at Camp Dr. Burt R. Shurly, Steven has helped bring joy, laughter, and learning to over 7000 Detroit Public Schools students.                Steven Snead is also a vocal artist on Detroit's latest music label, Muse Recordings. Featured on the hit album Marc's Project , Steven has performed at many metro Detroit venues, such as the 2005 Jambalaya, Arts Beat, & Eats 2005, Fishbone's, The Rhino, and the Detroit Yacht Club. He has also performed at national events, such as the 2005 Indianapolis Black Expo. As a member of Muse Recordings, Steven prides himself in creating music that is uncompromised by the day. This thriving small business is a shining example of the best that Detroit music has to offer.                Steven Snead is a product of the Detroit Public Schools, attending Whitney Young Middle School, and graduating from Cass Technical High School. He also attended St. Ladislaus Elementary School in Hamtramck (currently Dickinson West) and Our Lady Queen of Heaven Elementary School. Steven Snead went on to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor on a Wade H. McCree full academic scholarship, graduating with distinction in 2002 with a Bachelors Degree in Secondary Education. He also holds a Michigan Certified Teaching Certificate in English and Political Science. In 2006, Steven will earn his Masters Degree in Educational Leadership from Wayne State University.

AA11683910	Wow.  Your question is broad.  A great book to read on how some of agriculture started 12,000 years ago is Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs, and Steel".    Key developments in agriculture:  -Aqueducts - bring water from a distance to your crops  -The steel plow - dig and turn over more dirt  -Crop rotation - changing from field to field so you don't burn out any of your dirt  -Genetic modification - manipulating fruit and veggie genes so they grow bigger, badder, and juicier  -The cotton gin - a southerner's answer to the end of slavery in the United States  - Any farming tool you see today.  Farmers have $500,000 worth of tractors, combines, and such so they don't have to pick 1,000 acres of corn by hand.  -Fertilizer  -Today the biggest change is the use of Ethanol as a fuel for cars and trucks.  Before it was just for food or drink (or for lab experiments in college biology/chemistry class).|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	You might also want to learn to spell...it's your homework do it yourself.|`|AA11003681	Organic food would be interesting to research. It's popular right now and more farmers are switching to organic in search of larger profits.|`|AA11252231	The developments in agriculture are called the agricultural revolutions.  these are changes in the way we grow things that are so profound that they change human society.  There are three that everyone agrees on (and some others that are debated)  1) The neolithic revolution, 10,000 b.c. - this is when humans stopped being hunter/gatherers living nomadic tribes and became farmers with families living in walled towns.  The entire nature of our present human society depends on this change.  2) The "industrial" revolution, 1730-1760 - this is when we began to apply mechanical power and scientific method to farming.  In England Jethro Tull propounded crop rotation, selective breeding, contour farming and many other ideas that lead to more food being produced by fewer people.  Also at this time was the invention of the first farm machines like the seed drill and the steel plow. This meant that the extra population could move to cities to supply the labor for the early industrial development.  3) the green revolution 1950-1980. this is when scientists like Norman Borlaug developed new crops to suit agriculturally stressed environments (like India.) other scientists developed chemical fertilizers or insect sprays that dramatically increased food production in the third world.  Here is web site with links to articles about these revolutions:  http://www.answers.com/topic/agricultura...  Some people think we are now in a 4th revolution, the Biological revolution.

Batizado Francisco, Zumbi recebeu os sacramentos, aprendeu Portugus e Latim, e ajudava diariamente na celebra??o da missa. Apesar das tentativas de torn-lo "civilizado", Zumbi escapou em 1670 e, com 15 anos, retornou ao seu local de origem. Zumbi se tornou conhecido pela sua destreza e astcia na luta e j era um estrategista militar respeitvel quando chegou aos 20 e poucos anos.    Por volta de 1678, o governador da Capitania de Pernambuco cansado do longo conflito com o quilombo de Palmares, se aproximou do lder de Palmares, Ganga Zumba, com uma oferta de paz. Foi oferecida a liberdade para todos os escravos fugidos se o quilombo se submetesse  autoridade da Coroa Portuguesa; a proposta foi aceita. Mas Zumbi olhava os portugueses com desconfian?a. Ele se recusou a aceitar a liberdade para as pessoas do quilombo enquanto outros negros eram escravizados. Ele rejeitou a proposta do governador e desafiou a lideran?a de Ganga Zumba. Prometendo continuar a resistncia contra a opress?o portuguesa, Zumbi torna-se o novo lder do quilombo de Palmares.    Quinze anos aps Zumbi ter assumido a lideran?a, o bandeirante paulista Domingos Jorge Velho foi chamado para organizar a invas?o do quilombo. Em 6 de fevereiro de 1694 a capital de Palmares, Macaco,  destruda e Zumbi foi ferido. Apesar dele ter sobrevivido, ele foi trado, capturado e morto, quase dois anos aps a batalha, no dia 20 de novembro de 1695. Os portugueses transportaram a cabe?a de Zumbi para Recife, onde ela foi exposta em pra?a pblica, para mostrar que a lenda da imortalidade de Zumbi era irreal.    Zumbi  hoje, para a popula??o brasileira, um smbolo de resistncia.  tambm um dos nomes mais importantes da Capoeira.|`|374d172f6c85b184189e5c3439126b17aa	Zinedine Zidane.|`|e5b11836445be74bb96aece1ae869034aa	Seria Zumbi do Cornthians?|`|f807cf5c8a9d7495e8375da879b98a88aa	ELE NAO TINHA NOME, era um negro a mais na senzala e qualquer nome que adicione a ele a meu ver ,nao sao provas contundentes.|`|278ac6d51f99c6ac8945e2333fc36790aa	Francisco.|`|544cf24e42a993e5c4566142f26aa283aa	Titi Ribego|`|f029d783752ce85bbb2f763abb5cbf07aa	Zumbi nasceu livre em Palmares no ano de 1655, mas foi capturado e entregue a um missionrio portugus quando tinha aproximadamente 6 anos.

In the mills wooden-soled shoes were necessary because the floors were always wet to keep the air humid and leather shoes rotted. Dancers took their inspiration from the clatter of weaving machines and used their working shoes on the newly paved streets. Clog-dancing competitions and music hall performances spread the popularity of the new dance form. Musicians accompany the dance with a variety of instruments, including accordion, concertina, melodeon, violin and whistle. They play traditional British tunes.        July 1880: Carroll gives up photography     Quite suddenly Carroll gives up photography altogether. He had been something of a celebrity snapper of members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Michael Faraday, Tennyson, etc.      Alice In Wonderland    1881: Andrew Watson plays against England     The first black international footballer was Andrew Watson, a native of Demerara, in British Guyana. Watson was an immensely talented player as well as an able administrator. He played for Scotland against England three times between 1881 and 1882. In 1882 he became the first black player in the FA Cup, playing for the London Swifts who, unfortunately, did not make it to the final that year.      The FA Cup    18 Apr 1881: Benjamin Disraeli dies     The first and only Jewish Prime Minister (Conservative), Disraeli was a flamboyant politician whose head-to-heads with Liberal politician Gladstone during Victoria's reign defined English politics.        29 Aug 1882: "Ashes" born     After a disastrously poor show by the English cricket team against Australia, this obituary appeared in The Sporting Times the next day: "In Affectionate Remembrance of English Cricket Which Died At The Oval on 29th August 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances, RIP, NB: The body will be cremated, and the ashes taken to Australia." An Australian female fan later had the idea to present an urn of ashes to the English team. The Ashes series was born.        1884: First instalment of the OED     In the end the project took 70 years from its inception to publication of the final part! The dictionary is special because it traces the origins and meanings of English words based on their appearance in quotations collected by a vast army of volunteers.        1885: Westminster Cathedral built     This Catholic Cathedral is designed in the Byzantine style by John Francis Bentley. Although the interior is still a work in progress, it has stunning mosaics, distinctive marble floors and columns, and boasts a fine series of the Stations of the Cross carved in stone by the sculptor Eric Gill.        1885: First Home Rule Bill defeated     Gladstone tried to introduce a Bill that would set up a Parliament in Dublin with control over Irish domestic affairs. The Bill was defeated despite the high number of Irish nationalist MP's sitting at that time.        1885: Jewish "Temporary Shelter" opens     Opened in Leman Street, London, the shelter was designed to give Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe somewhere to stay for their first 14 days in England. The need for such a shelter is a testament to the growing Jewish community in the East End of London and the difficult conditions they encountered when they first arrived.        1885: The Mikado first performed     Possibly the most famous of the comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan, The Mikado pokes fun at English bureaucracy but is set in Japan. Mike Leigh's film Topsy Turvy has some brilliant behind-the-scenes re-creations of the Savoy Theatre and the first production.        26 Jan 1885: General Gordon murdered     General Gordon was sent by the British to help the Egyptians retain control over the Sudan against troops led by the Muslim Mahdi. Gordon is speared to death by dervishes in Khartoum. The painting Gordon's Last Stand by GW Joy became the defining image of heroic self-sacrifice in the cause of the Empire, a good example of art being used to popularise a political myth. In the days before television, such paintings were powerful propaganda.        11 Dec 1886: Arsenal play their first match     Arsenal Football Club is formed by workers at the Woolwich Arsenal Armaments Factory but their team name at this time is Dial Square. They win this match against the Eastern Wanderers by a resounding 6-0.        1887: Blackpool Rock invented     Ben Bullock invents the idea of having the name "Blackpool" running through a stick of rock        1887: First Sherlock Holmes mystery     Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson first appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study In Scarlet        21 Jun 1887: Victoria's Golden Jubilee     The celebrations for Victoria's 50 years on the throne start at a local level with village fairs and street parties and go as high as official ceremonies attended by politicians from all over the world, confirming Britain's status as a giant among nations. The celebrations also bring Victoria out of her shell a little more; after many years of mourning she engages with her subjects once again.        31 Aug 1888: Mary Ann Nicholls murdered     Jack the Ripper claims his first, of at least five, victims in the East End.        1889: First purpose-built mosque opens     The Shah Jehan Mosque opens in Woking; there are now approximately 1,500 mosques in Britain        1889: Three Men In A Boat published     Jerome K Jerome's delightful story of three friends and their dog, Montmorency, who take a rowing trip u|`|7f6639179056a28c0cdc8656874547d3aa	I would reeasrch the name William Ewart Gladstone.

AA11765415	Amperage|`|338bfdec602da3d0e810e79c55f5a351aa	An electric shock occurs when a person comes into contact with an electrical energy source. Electrical energy flows through a portion of the body causing a shock. Exposure to electrical energy may result in no injury at all or may result in devastating damage or death.     Burns are the most common injury from electric shock.    Electric Shock Causes  Adolescents and adults are prone to high voltage shock caused by mischievous exploration and exposure at work. About 1,000 people in the United States die each year as a result of electrocution. Most of these deaths are related to on-the-job injuries.     Many variables determine what injuries may occur, if any. These variables include the type of current (AC or DC), the amount of current (determined by the voltage of the source and the resistance of the tissues involved), and the pathway the electricity takes through the body. Low voltage electricity (less than 500 volts) does not normally cause significant injury to humans. Exposure to high voltage electricity (greater than 500 volts) has the potential to result in serious damage.    If you are going to help someone who has sustained a high voltage shock, you need to be very careful that you don't become a second victim of a similar electrical shock. If a high voltage line has fallen to the ground, there may be a circle of current spreading out from the tip of the line. Your best bet may be to call 911. The electric company will be notified so that the power can be shut off. A victim who has fallen from a height or sustained a severe shock causing multiple jerks may have a serious neck injury and should not be moved without first protecting the neck.    Children are not often seriously injured by electricity. They are prone to shock by the low voltage (110-220 volts) found in typical household current. In children aged 12 years and younger, household appliance electrical cords and extension cords caused more than 63% of injuries in one study. Wall outlets were responsible for 15% of injuries.

One tenth of a milliamp or something like that is considered fatal if i crosses your heart.  Voltage is what you feel when you get shocked by electricty but a high voltage, low amp shock is just painful. most common is 120 volt shocks from household items. 277 really hurts.|`|8f483860204d0baf77398cf1471a2743aa	I think, its a common misconception that the voltage is what makes the electic shock fatal. Actually, its the amount of current that flows into your body that brings about death. Being in contact with a low amount of voltage for a long time is more fatal than being in contact with a higher amount of voltage in a very short time.    But of course, voltage also plays a crucial role here, since the higher amount of voltage you get in contact with, the more current will flow into your body in a shorter time.

So you have red marbles (R) and Green ones(G)   The question is the diference btw what you started with to what you ended up with. ok    So you lost 25%of the (R) to be left with 375.  so you get the formula                  R-0.25R=375  so           R(1-0.25)=375  Then       R(0.75)=375  therfore    R= 500    then you gained 25%of the the green one you get the formula                G+0.25G=375  so          G(1+0.25)=375  then       G(1.25)=375  therfore  G=300                  R+G=500+300=800 marbles is what you started with.  since we know that you ended up with 375 of each we add them to get 750 (375+375=750)    which means you lost 50 marbles. (800-750=50)    and that is you answer.|`|7225ca071a8eac9723c1e029d36a5e78aa	Ok. So here's how to work it out, step by step. I'll try to make it as clear as possible.    Bob started out with all of (100% of) his marbles, right? You don't know how many red marbles he started out with, so it's 100%x (or any variable you'd like to use). And then, he gave 25%x of them away, and he had 375 marbles left over.  So, you do:    100%x-25%x=375  75%x=375 (subtracted 25% from 100%)  x=375/75% (divide both sides by 75%)  x=500 red marbles    Let's start on the green marbles now. Okay--so you also don't know how many green marbles he had. So again, you have to use 'x'. He gained 25% of green marbles. That would be his orginal amount of green marbles (100%x) plus 25%x. Therefore, the equation is:    100%x+25%=375  125%=375 (add the percents together)  x=375/125% (divide both sides by 125%)  x=300 green marbles    Now, you want to subtract the sum of the total   of red & green marbles from the   of red marbles he had left after he gave some away, and the number of green marbles he had after he bought some more. Then:    (375+375) - (500+300)  = 750 - 800  = -50 marbles.    Bob lost 50 marbles.|`|b4be9b3fa914caf76fb5f92980075cdaaa	o%

968bc7c8dfa5c8ee23e19a7e540db963aa	Todays competitive job market means that minimum acceptable skills are being replaced with higher standards.  And among the higher standards are what many call soft skills.                A soft skill refers to the cluster of personality traits, social graces, facility with language, personal habits, friendliness, and optimism that mark each of us to varying degrees.  Persons who rank high in this cluster, with good soft skills, are generally the people that most employers want to hire.  Soft skills complement hard skills, which are the technical requirements of a job. The ideal, of course, is someone strong in both job and personal skills, but as one employer put it in a recent report, Hard Work and Soft Skills, Dont worry so much about the technical skills. We need you to teach them how to show up on time, how to work in teams, and how to take supervision.                In the Career Center, it is interesting to note which candidates make the best impression on visiting recruiters.  Invariably, it seems that recruiters like the outgoing, friendly, well-adjusted candidates more than those with great qualifications but less acceptable soft skills.  And there is no question that personal appearance contributes significantly to a positive reaction.|`|AA11362424	People skills or communication skills|`|AA12228127	Computer skills refer to one's ability to utilize the software (and sometimes hardware) of a computer.     Soft skills refer to the cluster of personality traits, social graces, facility with language, personal habits, friendliness, and optimism that mark people to varying degrees. Soft skills complement hard skills, which are the technical requirements of a job.     Soft skills can also be an important part of the success of an organization. Organizations, particularly those frequently dealing with customers face-to-face, are generally more prosperous if they train their staff to use these skills. For this reason, soft skills are increasingly sought out by employers in addition to standard qualifications.     Common Soft Skills include:     Following common Etiquette   Using appropriate body language such as friendly gestures, head nods, facial expressions, body posture and good eye contact   Using appropriate tone of voice and language   Relating to individuals in common conversation, regardless of interests or background   Making others feel comfortable in situations outside their normal sphere of action   Clear and often persuasive manners of speech     Leadership abilities often fall into the category of Soft skills, as they are more than often acquired through personal experience rather than traditional learning environments

c6099bb220bb7c22e9ac2b9fa95b8bb4aa	Here are some!    Leonardo da Vinci  The original Renaissance Man, Leonardo had a passionate interest in learning and exploring new concepts in art and science. His Mona Lisa and Last Supper are among the most influential and significant works in Renaissance art, and his scientific notebooks and inventions were years ahead of his time.    Nicolau Copernicus  Nicolau Copernicus (sometimes spelled Nicolaus, Nicolas, Nicholas, Nikalaus or Nikolas; in Polish, Mikolaj Kopernik, Niclas Kopernik or Nicolaus Koppernigk) has been called "the founder of modern astronomy." Although not the first scientist to propose that the Earth revolved around the sun, his bold return to the theory (first proposed by Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd-century B.C.) had significant and far-reaching effects in the evolution of scientific thought.    Hypatia of Alexandria  Recognized as the leader of Neoplatonist school of philosophy in Alexandria, Hypatia studied astronomy and wrote mathematical and scientific commentaries. She was brutally murdered by Christian monks, possibly at the command of a jealous bishop.    Paracelsus  Also known as Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, Paracelsus was a physician and alchemist who made significant strides in the field of medicine. He applied his knowledge of chemistry toward matters of healing, thus establishing the science as a significant tool for physicians. He wrote dozens of scientific works, most notably Der grossen Wundartzney ("Great Surgery Book"), and made groundbreaking advances in understanding and treating wounds and diseases.    Regiomontanus  Born Johann Mller, Regiomontanus took his name from the Latinized form of his home town, K?nigsberg, "King's Mountain." In 1461 he completed the re-translation begun by Peuerbach of Ptolemy's Almagest from Arabic to Latin. This improved translation sparked new interest in mathematics and ultimately led to Ptolemy's successful refutation by Copernicus. Regiomontanus also wrote De triangulis omnimodis libri quinque ("Five Books on Triangles of All Kinds," published posthumously in 1533), the earliest modern work to explore plane and spherical trigonometry.    Roger Bacon  Roger Bacon (also spelled "Bachon") was born into an affluent family, received a superior education, and devoted his life to the pursuit of knowledge. Taking a degree from the University of Paris, he lectured there on Aristotelian and pseudo-Aristotelian treatises, becoming known as Doctor Mirabilis ("Wonderful Teacher"). Bacon later returned to Oxford, where his interest in the sciences intensified.|`|0a278e7366db86104dd419e97cfa089faa	Aristotle?|`|c596a5370144a5889ce9064ed530bf6faa	here are some them, hope they can help you    Charles Babbage Joseph Locke   John Bernal  John MacAdam   Henry Bessemer Charles Macintosh   George Bidder George Macintosh   John Blenkinsop Reginald J.
