I would feel flutters and tingling.    I was diagnosed with placenta arubtion, where the placenta partially deaches from the uterus.      I bleed 2 weeks ago and then 3 days ago.   A mid wife listened to the heart beat and said it was normal.   I was not able to feel my baby until 3 days ago when I bleed, the and even since then I don't feel the baby. I should be feeling it more now, not less??      Is this normal???

My ten month old is constantly climbing up on the fish tank which is full of water and is on a stand.  The stand does rock a little when he leans on it, a few people have said it is safe but others think that if he gets enough of  a rock on it, then it might topple over just with the weight of the water .  Do you think this is possible I would rather be safe than sorry if there is even a slight chance ?

20090307235239AArJEeN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	4 year old and 13 year old problems?	First I will start with the 13 year old. She throws fits when you tell her no. She spits on you. She kicks, screams. curses, doesn't listen, steals if we don't give her money (normally from someones bag or my room), defies me, and much more. She got suspended 4 times in her school. She is bipolar and anorexic. I ground her, take things away like privileges, time out, sending her to her room, and as last resort if it gets that far spanking. The only time she does listen is when i tap her lightly. I am in charge of my 4 year old brother, 13 year old sister, and 9 year old brother. My gf is pregnant. My parents died. What should I do? How do I get her to stop cursing?      Now with the 4 year old he does the same thing. He screams and throws fits. When we are out if I tell him no we already have that he'll throw it at me. If I ask something he talks back and says no. I have spanked him, put him in timeout, talking to him as well as the 13 year old, sending him to his room, refraining him from family activities or just canceling them (do that with the 13 year old too), everything. The only thing that seems to be getting through to them is hitting them and I hate hitting them. What should I do? He repeats and does everything the 13 year old and the 9 year old do. So if they curse he curses.      What I did one time which worked was I kept my sister in my room and I had all her cherished items. Everytime she cursed I erased some of her contacts in her phone. I did everything she loves to do. I didn't torture her I just did it enough to make her learn. She burst out crying and said sorry.       How do I discipline these kids?

20090307230625AAFQCNI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Inappropriate commercials?	Ok, you might have seen my previous question about extenze, if not here it is:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...                 Now, what do I do about other inappropriate commercials? I know that they show up on my son's favorite channels (teletoon and discovery). Things like the axe commercial, the shampoo commercials in which the girls touch themselves in very inappropriate places and the girls gone wild commercial. Teletoon starts showing the girls gone wild commercial slightly before adult time has started. The problem is that that's when he's watching Loony Toons. Last time it showed up I changed the channel really fast so he didn't really see anything but the logo, but if I don't do anything, eventually he will see it. The shampoo commercials are always on teletoon and discovery. Is there any way to block commercials? Also, Who should I complain to about this? I really think that teletoon is really irresponsible for not showing adult commercials at exactly adult time (aka the detour) instead of 10 mins before.

My periods are very irregular because I have PCOS which makes it harder for me to ovulate. On February 14, 2008 I started spotting and it lasted 4 or 5 days. I was expecting my period around the 19th of February but it still hasnt come. The following symptoms have been appearing for about a week: I am bloated, my breast hurt, I have cramps, and I have been having hot flashes and getting flushed cheeks, and ive also been feeling extra tired. February 27th I had a quantitative pregnancy blood test done and it was negative. and a week and a half ago I did two home pregnancy tests and they were negative also. My friend is pregnant and she didnt get a positive home pregnancy test until she was 8 weeks along. Could it be possible that I am pregnant?? When should I test again with a home pregnancy test? Please, I really need some good advice.

I am in college, and I'm about to start a Dental Assistant program in which I will be done with in September. In my area the job offers about 30 - 35,000 a year, which is not bad.. Anyway, back to my TTC- I want a baby very badly, and I know that the majority of the answers will be, "You should wait until your married!" I do not want to get married, but I want to have a baby. I would be getting a sperm donor from a friend of mine, and he does want to be involved (with the baby, not with me romantically). I've been taking prenatal vitamins because I read that you should take them three months before conception. I've been reading a lot of books on pregnancy and motherhood. Anyway, if I got pregnant three months from now, I would be 18, and in five months from now, I will be starting a full time job. I believe I'm fully capable of handling a baby. I will not need any government assistance, either. The only thing I wonder is if it is selfish of me to have a baby just because I want it so badly. I KNOW that I'd be a good mother, but the advice I've been given is so biased. What does anyone else think?

20090307231115AAO5WA7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	15 Weeks Pregnant- Dealing with depression.?	So as of today I am 15 weeks pregnant with my second child. I've been extremely moody, bust out crying for no reason at all, I stay in bed most of the day, and am a complete horror to my husband. I can barely stand to be in the same room with him. And with my husband deploying back to Iraq in a few months... I don't want to be feeling this way during our last few months together.    At first, I thought it was all normal because of being pregnant. Until today, one of my good friends brought up the fact that its only getting worse and that I should talk to my doctor about it and possibly get put on anti- depressants.    Is there anyone that went through something like this while pregnant? And how did you resolve the problem?

20090227124716AAjFdIJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	So should I be feeling put off by this?....?	My fiances parents who haven't taken an active role in our sons life have just recently bombarded us with their plans to have our son baptized.  Now neither of us are religious and they are very aware of that, however, they are and they called my fiance yesterday asking him what our plans on his "religious upbringing" are.  I really don't think it's any of their business, we are the parents. They also said they want him to be baptized and will make all the arrangements.  I feel EXTREMELY put off by this, number one because they have had zero involvement in the past 6 months of his life, number two because I feel it's outright disrespect of our beliefs.  My fiance wants me to go along with it just to please that side of the family but I do not believe in baptizing a child for no reason, in my eyes if a child is baptized it should be because the parents put stock in it, that's what they believe.  I do not want to baptize him just because!  That's silly and I wouldn't want what's supposed to be a meaningful experience be in complete vain.  Am I being unreasonable?  Should I just let them do it to make them happy?

20090227124319AABNoWQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to teach my nearly 10 month old to sleep all night?

20090227124145AAQtHBf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby's belly button question!!!?	My little girl will be 12 weeks old on Monday.     Her umbilical cord stump fell off when she was 9 days old.  After that it continued to "drain" a bit.  The doctors said it was fine.  When I took her to a new doctor at 4-5 weeks because of "colic" the nurse said the doctor needed to look at the belly button.  The doctor said it was beginning to form a bit of scar tissue and he cortorized (sp?) it.  Put some kind of silver stuff on it that smelled to high heavens.   Now she's almost 12 weeks old and it's still draining a bit.  Mostly after she has a screaming/crying spell, or if she strains really hard (like going to the bathroom).  It's sort of like a bloody discharge.  It's a yellowy reddish color.  She's been to the doc since then, and he didn't say anything about it and I forgot to mention it at the 2 mo check up.  I'm just wondering if this is normal, and if I should be concerned, and if so, HOW concerned?         Also, can babies have ingrown toenails?  The flesh on her toes seem to "roll" up over the nails.  Toenails look more like (/\), instead of /()\.

20090227123203AAQ7G1t	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Unhealthy Behavior -- Is My Kid Normal?	My daughter recently turned a year old. Until maybe a month prior to her first birthday, I had been nursing her (not exclusively).       She now eats table food exclusively, but still shows tremendously unhealthy preoccupation with being un-weaned. Although I have not nursed her for nearly two months, she continues to obsess over my breasts. To the extent that she will not play with her toys for periods longer than five-ten minute intervals, will not play alone, reaches down my shirt, aggressively objects when I try to stop her, crawls across the room to me only to reach under my shirt, aggressively objects when I intervene, scratches me, hits me, tantrums, passes out onto the floor or into objects, shows very short interest when I'm reading to her, slightly longer interest when I watch educational programs with her, cannot be left with others, will not let me leave the room, etc. She even becomes so tempered that she'll cause herself to choke. When I console her, she lays against me and pretends to suckle. If she drifts off to sleep, she immediately awakes when I place her down. I have never witnessed separation anxiety to this degree. I'm partially beginning to regret ever nursing her to begin with.           Is this normal behavior for a child of this age under the circumstances? I would love to hear your experiences and thoughts. Thanks for your help.

20090227124528AAPRGlS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	So another question reminded me that I wanted to ask this...for moms?	Is there anything you have done recently that has sabotaged you as a mother?  Something that made it harder for you to parent, something that made you feel down when you were just feeling up.  Anything at all that made your life more difficult?  You could really take this in any direction, but here's mine:      I recently bought myself a 10x magnifying mirror.  BAD idea.  I have all these wrinkles and blemishes I didn't know I had.  I am obsessed with mapping them all out.  And I pluck every little eyebrow hair.  I can see EVERYTHING!! :(   I also bought a kitchenaid mixer.  It would be really fun except my 3 year old thinks it's magic and begs to use it every single day.  Now we're making loads of cookies and desserts.  Not good for my over magnified face OR my diet.      How bout you?  Anything?
20070502140913AAMTlMf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How many of you had the nesting feeling and how long after you got it did you have your baby?	The reason is because with my first baby I never got the nesting feeling that everyone says you get. With this pregnancy yesterday I was completely feeling it. I reorganized everything in our apartment. Just wondering if anyone else has had or has this feeling and how long you after this feeling did you have your baby? I also felt very nervous, worried and scared last night that it was literally hurting my stomach.

20090227124314AAG9bjF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Farther driving with toddler in no carseat - how would you have reacted?	I stopped to get some petrol today.  My mom was sitting in my car waiting for me with my daughter in the back.     A man of Pakistani origin had parked next to my car filling up his own car which was a taxi vehicle. He had a small boy no older than 6 or 7 years old sitting in the back of the car, no restraint at all, no seat belt, no booster seat or anything.     When I returned to my car, my mom said that this little lad had climbed into the front driving seat while the man was gone (he was in front of me in the queue) and was playing with the window switch making the windows go up and down.  The keys were still in the ignition and the child turned the keys making the car jump forward.   My mom shouted through my car window at this man when he returned to his vehicle just seconds before me.  He shrugged it off and looked not at all bothered.   This made me worried, not only for that poor child's safety but also my own baby because that man could have turned nasty at my mom for interfering.   If you saw something like this and you have your own little ones with you at the time, would you say something?

20090227124705AAnVDtZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is it safe to let an 11 month old to sleep in a room alone?	I'm wondering because now that I've moved house shes in her own room (i've put a single bed in beside her cot just in case she needs attention).       She can't get out of her cot but I worry at night because shes so young. I know cot death is being prevented as I follow the guidelines and shes a fairly active in her sleep (she crawls around in her cot while asleep).      Do you think she'll be ok in there on her own? My room is right next to hers and I'll leave the door open.       Am I just panicking over nothing?

20090227123125AAnRurY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Took Plan B...concerned still...?	My girlfriend and I had sex one night and when i *** i pulled out and noticed that the condom had torn at the tip. She took plan B about 13-14 hours after this happened. its been 3 days since she took the pill and she says that she still feels abdominal pain on one side of her pelvic area... . This is worrying us because we were reading about this and it said that this might mean that you have an ectopic pregnancy... I really want to know if we should worry about it or not. Oh yeah and she isnt 18 yet, so would she have to get parental consent or have a parent notified if she were to go and get it checked? Thank You.
20090227123403AAEbNqP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Tranisitioning a 12 month old to table food....HELP?	My 12 month old teethed late, so he was late starting  any thicker solids anyways. We started the stage 2 foods when he was 6 months, and he has always done fine with those. But we started the stage 3s about a month ago when his top teeth finally came in, and he still chokes on them, plus I don't think he likes them, because he puts up a fight everytime we try to feed them to him. He does good with puffs and if we break saltine crackers in half, he does pretty good with those. But we tried cheerios, and he chokes on them. We have tried cutting up fruits and putting them on his tray so he can feed himself, but with bananas, he would rather sit there and squish them, and with things like strawberrys that are a little more slippery, he cant grip them, and he just gets mad. Plus, there have been quite a few occasions where we have tried to give him some sort of table food that is soft enough and all that, but he chokes. On more than one occasion, we have had to take him out of the high chair and flip him over, and give him a rough pat on the back when he was choking. So, now, of course, I am terrified to give him anything, because we are so scared of him choking. Plust we really just have no clue how to go about making this transition. As far as what we should be giving him, how we should prepare it. Should we still puree it? Or blend it, but make it chunky? Or just give it to him in pieces on his tray and let him feed himself?????? Any advice? And please don't tell me to suck it up, or quit being scared, or anything like that, if it was that simple, I would have done that by now. . lol. Thanks :)

20070419120803AAzo1SU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Placenta previa!! is it safer opting for a c-section?	i am pregnant with my 8th child so am classed as a high risk patient anyway!  but to add to my problems i have had placenta previa since wk 26 and there has been no change.  My babies head is level with the lower edge of the placenta.  The LE of the placenta is 3.5cm from the OS      I have been told that i could go through a normal delivery with no complications or that i could bleed but they would have theatre ready incase this happened!!  Alternativley i could have a c-section but again there is a risk that they would need to cut through the placenta to get to the baby and this could cause heavy bleeding!!  Has anyone got advise to what i should choose or have you been through a similar procedure and could offer advise?  I'm at my wits end with worry as i am a high risk patient anyway.  All my other deliveries were straight forward with no complications.
