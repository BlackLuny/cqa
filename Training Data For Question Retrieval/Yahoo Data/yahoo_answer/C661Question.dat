20070312060947AA6ordS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it time to call it quits after 12 years?	I have been married for 12 years and I think I have had enough.  When he is around I feel like I am sufficating.  He is really hard on our oldest son to the point that my son is actually asking me to leave him.  He works comes home and does nothing but complain and expects to be waited on hand and foot.  He is the type that thinks he is always right and when I try to tell him to cool it I get told to shut up and if I don't like it then leave.  If I want to do something and he don't then we don't do it.  He is refusing to go to our son's basketball game because it is to far away and I don't believe in missing any sport that our kids are in.  My son is not doing well in school, becasue of missing homework.  I asked him why he don't bring it home to do it and he told me it is because his dad looks over his shoulder and makes him feel stupid.  Everything in me wants a divorce but part of me feels guilty.  If I leave he has no one, part to do with his attitude.  Also, I dont work.

20070312215649AAJx5F7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Internet harrasment?	Would having strangers make up a screenname that is identical to yours, with a # or symbol added, and post on a national wedding forum pretending to be you, be considered harrasement to the police? I've emailed the forum moderators, but they won't do anything. Here are examples of what is being said...   "Do you mind if I call you "cousin" while we do it? If you don't I"ll give you a sex ring. i like her because shes so fat - its nice and cushiony.""I like it when she puts her arms up over her head and I do her from behind. Then the backfat sort of goes away."did she cry rape on you too? just because i made her bleed."she freaked out when I whispered cousin in her ear while we were doing it, then she cried rape. then she came back because I gave her a sex ring."if you don't hear from me for a few hours, it's because i'll be under the sheets in her hospital bed. I have to make sure she keeps choosing life! Of course, the oxygen mask should block screams

He has not heard from her or talked to his son in a year.  He has vistation rights, and she has moved and changed her number.

20070323163700AAVZeKl	Family & Relationships;Friends	A friend on Crack.?	I have friend on crack that has four children.  The ages are 7 which are twins, 9, 15.  The 15 year old is living with his father.  I am so worried about the younger ones.  Their mother just will not leave it alone.  I used to feel sorry for her. But it has been 7 years since she started so I do not feel for her anymore.  I can not have any children and when she was expecting the twins she was smoking while she was carrying them.  I begged her to stop but she is selfish and does not care.  Her 9 year old can tell me step by step on how to load up a crack pipe.  I have called social services and they have not done anything about it.  Thank God the twins was born ok.  I am just to fed up.  The only thing that is keeping me going in this friendship is the kids.  She is so neg. and we have nothing in common except the kids.  Please advise me on what to do.  I am at my wits in.  Should I end the friendship.  I have done everything I know of.  She has been on welfare for 15 years.

20070424113951AACnk3I	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, what do you think?	You meet a girl who's clearly in an emotional abusive marriage and she is not noticing you because in her mind, she's trapped where she is.....    She hasn't talked to you about any of it... then one day you ask her, "Can I say something personal to you?" and you tell her, "I'd help you move."      Then 6 months later, she's almost divorced and the two of you communicate constantly...... and what began as nothing is clearly becoming something...... but you maintain your distance because when she's in the room it works you up... the paint just about melts off the walls.      Why won't he come over when I ask?   Do you think he's in "love" with me?      Why would he spend 6 months listening to me and being supportive if he didn't care?   And if he cares, how come it seems like he also avoids me?      Do you think he's waiting on the divorce to be over?   (I've asked him.... he says he doesn't know what he wants. But he clearly doesn't want me to go either...)

20070505000855AATAHjB	Family & Relationships;Friends	If majority of straight men are really heterosexual, how's the ancient Greek & other such societies possible?	For all those men who claim that straights are all exclusively or even primarily heterosexuals.....      .....just because their manipulative society has defined 'straight' as such.....      .....and because there exists a separate 'gay' identity they claim that all men who like men are there....      How come in ancient Greece and several such societies the vast majority of men had sexual relations with another man during their youth, and they married only when they reached 30. Furthermore, they carried on their male bonds even after that, and marriage was considered more a social duty, and for reproduction.      Similarly, in the oldest living tribals that we have interacted with, the tribes of Papa New Guinea ------ all men primarily have sexual relations only with other men. They have sex with women only for reproduction. They have contined till today ----- several thousands of years.      This lifestyle is exactly in tandem with how mammals live in the wild.

20070521193515AAQXvGX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend Advice...?	My boyfriend and I and my bf have been dating for 7 months. I like him and he likes me.   In the beginning, we were so close and almost inseparable, until I made the biggest mistake of my life. I started talking about other guys and he found out. I still don’t know why I did what I did, but I wish id never done it.    He says he can’t sleep at night because he is ate up with worry that I am going to do it again. And that he doesn’t really trust me anymore because I did that. He and I have fights almost every week because of a little thing I have done, and then he refers back to what I did. it wasn’t really even like cheating, just comments never meant to be said.   I’m not anything like that anymore, and I don’t mean what I had said. Its all nothing to me now. I have apologized many times and he said he forgave me, but everytime we fight, it comes up in conversation.   I want us to be like we were before, and I don’t think it is possible anymore. I don’t think we can be the same.   HELP!!!

While she is in a committed relationship we have spent an increasingly amount of time together after I confessed my feelings of love for her.   And now the part that confuses me is that whenever her boyfriend is in trouble or whenever she is in trouble, she comes to me...   Why would she come to me when she has someone else???  I'm not saying the I don't enjoy being asked to help her in anyway shape or form but, why does she come to me when she is with her boyfriend?      I respect him and I know that he can get himself out of any situation that he gets himself into.  What gives?

20070508064607AAUsGfu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I investigate?	I met this guy. Happened to be a childhood friend of a trusted relative. His brothers are friends of my brother too, but he and I never hang out as the age difference is quite great. We live in different states now but that hasn't stopped us dating. I don't know much about him apart from what he tells me. But somehow I have this gutfeel that something doesn't quiet add up. Should I succumb to private investigation? He proposed to marry.       Do I have the right to know everything about him? or take his answer at face value?      He makes me happy but I'm afraid of whatever skeletons I might find in his closet.

He treats me like a princess. Here's the issue. I'm in my mid 20's and he's in his early 50's. When I'm not with him I miss him and he calls me every day when we don't see each other. I can't define what we are and am afraid to ask because I don't want him to get upset. It sounds messy but it's not that bad. I also don't know how to deal cuz its a secret thing from everyone cuz of my family and people at work.(he used to work with me but now he's in a different department.) I want to tell but he doesn't(I have an issue w/ my family knowing and although I dont care he's got an issue w/ work people knowing. So do I cut it off and date someone else, Demand a defination or keep going w this cuz he makes me happy  & I don't want to lose him

20070529103642AAKrVVM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he using me? or does he like me a lot?	so me and this guy met on a 9 day cruise. we hung out the 1st,2nd,and 3rd in a big group of people..and on the 4th we hung out with people and then hung out alone. we talked the entire night and we ended up hooking up at the end of the night. he slept over that night and we layed together, and before we even hooked up he asked if we would hang out the next night. the next night he was in the casino and my friend got him cause i wanted to hang out, he came, and we went to his room and were talking for a bit, and then i layed down on the bed, and he followed..and we started hooking up and he did everything to me, i did nothing to him, and we ended up having sex in the moment. after that we went to the casino and i was really tired so i said i was going back to my room, he said he would come later, and he did. he came back to lay with me and sleepover. the next night he came looking for me and thought i was with another guy, which i wasnt. he didnt talk to me that night, or the next night, and finally the 8th night he confronted me about it. i told him i wasnt with another guy, and he even asked my best friend what the deal with me was. she told him i wasnt with another guy and that i like him a lot. that night we talked the entire night again, and had sex at the very end of the night. this time was different from the first time because he was constantly asking me if i was alright, and he told me to tell him if it hurts and when to stop. he slept over again that night to lay with me..and he asked me if the whole next day we could hang out. we didnt end up hanging out the whole next day cause me and my friend went tanning, but that night we did and nothing happened. just at the end he gave me a kiss on the cheek goodbye. and right after the cruise, he contacted me right away. we've been in contact for 9 months now, and we've seen eachother twice since the cruise, and nothing has happened. recently he told me on the phone that i never write him anymore on myspace..and he said "lets keep this long distance relationship going"      i happen to be going to college near him in 3 months, and he is aware of this.         is he using me?

Ho conosciuto un ragazzo in una chat e abbiamo passato notti intere a parlare fino all'alba.Non ha mai voluto incontrarmi perchè entrambi avevamo altre relazioni ed era sicuro che incontrandoci avremmo compromesso i nostri rapporti.Un mese fa si è sposato ed è stato a parlare con me anche la notte prima delle sue nozze.Ora ci sentiamo quando possiamo ma io non riesco più a vivere pensando che quella era la grande occasione della mia vita per essere felice. Cerco di non pensarci ma non dipende da me, mi detesto per questo amore che non mi è concesso di provare e , inevitabilmente, di tradire seppur mentalmente il mio uomo. Tra qualche giorno partirò e tornerò solo fra tre mesi ma quando torno andrò a cercarlo per guardarlo almeno una volta negli occhi.Io non voglio che lui faccia soffrire la sua donna per me ma qualcuno sa dirmi come si fa a togliersi un amore immenso che sembra assurdo ma così semplicemente reale dalla testa?

20070617154131AAXxSmw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do I do after a break up like this?	My boyfriend & I had been dating for 5 years when we figured the time was right to start seriously discussing marriage.  We get "engaged" & a few months after that, his phone conversations with me get short and snippy, then all of a sudden he said he doesn't want to get married.  Up to this time, we had no problems, were madly in love, and had been planning our lives together for years.  we discussed all the concerns we had about marriage, and knew for a long time that this was the step we wanted to take.  He was actually the one who kept pushing it more than me...he was ready.  when he started to have "cold feet" i was the one who said not to rush it and we'll just do it later.  but in the end, it was that he didn't want to be with me.  how does that happen?  what did i do?  there was no explanation, no discussion, no nothing.  i've never heard of a situation like this where the guy is ready to commit, then out of the blue, he just says no to everything! no to me & our love.

I tend to laugh at things that are not suppose to be funny, I try to sing along to song that I think I know the words to. Making eye contact with people I'm attracted to is a hard thing for me to do.

Dont judge me by the way I look it will get toyou nowhere. I can be a nice person if I like you if I dont oh well get over it. Quotes are the only thing that can get me by at times. I do speak my mind when I feel like it. I can be very concieded at times but then I am a very self concious person. I typically dislike the way I look but there are those times I dont. I like to try to think I can deal with things on my own, even if I know deep down I can't.

Alors je suis désolé ma chérie,   mais j'aimerais avoir une femme 30 ans plus jeune que moi.   La femme est terriblement dé?ue, mais un voeu est un voeu.   La fée fait un cercle avec sa baguette magique... abracadabra ! Soudain le mari a 90 ans !   Les hommes sont peut-être des salauds, mais les Fées sont des femmes !!!      Jolie non ?      Merci à la personne qui me la fait conna?tre.      Bon aprèm à vous

20070810020545AAy27WH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why should I be myself?	Why is the advice to always be yourself given for people who are looking for relationships. I know it helps weed out the bad ones and only shows those ones who really fit one's personality and all. But it doesn't help one attract people in general, as in attract more people than they had before.      Because I'm being myself, and it only attracts people I don't like, or one's I'm not attracted to. If I was to become someone else, someone who is more confident and overall happy, then I probably would attract more people I like than what I am doing now.

Mieux qu'un chaud jour d'été, c'est un jour très chaud de printemps dans lequel l'air vibre et scintille de l'énergie nouvelle. Sur le bord du chemin et au fa?te d'une douce c?te, la haie s'ouvre et nous offre une vue qui nous fige. C'est une immensité jaune, un jaune intense ondoyant sous une brise intermittente. Un jaune plus vif que le Soleil et qui fait cligner des yeux. Un champ certainement oublié, laissé, abandonné : un tapis de pissenlits si serrés qu'on ne distingue que de vagues traces de vert en dessous des fleurs. Presque pris de vénération, comme si nous commettions un sacrilège, nous pénétrons lentement dans ce sanctuaire s?rement sacré, chevilles et mollets bient?t couverts d'un léger duvet jaune. Je t'assieds sur ce moelleux tapis et tu frissonnes sous la caresse de milliers de pétales porteurs de pollen, et ce délice de sensations remonte jusqu'à ton visage qui s'illumine...

Ne sous-estimez pas l'intelligence et la capacité de déduction de nos petites têtes blondes ! Dès qu'ils savent lire, ils s'aper?oivent que la grande majorité des jouets à une étiquette marquée : "made in China". China ? C'est la Chine ?      Eh oui ! Plus de 75 % de tous les jouets fabriqués dans le monde viennent de l'Empire du Milieu. Ce qui en fait le pricipal fournisseur du Père No?l. De là à en déduire que le barbu en habit rouge a en fait le tein mat et les yeux bridés, il n'y a qu'un pas.      Remarquez au passage que l'image "traditionnelle" que nous avons du vieux n'est pas meilleure : c'est Saint Nicolas à la sauce Coca-Cola (véridique ! C'est une publicité pour cette boisson qui a imposé l'image du Père No?l habillé en blanc et rouge).      Qu'en pensez-vous ? Le Père No?l du XXIe siècle n'est-il pas chinois ? Doit-on l'avouer à nos enfants ?      Merci.

Durante un rapporto sessuale a quante di voi fa piacere sentirsi dire troion. pompinar. o cose simili? Non fa fede la classica maialina o maialino che reputo quasi facenti parte del fatto erotico. E se anche non vi fa piacere quanti uomini usano questi termini nonostante tutto (mi riferisco ai primi troion. pompinar). Vi sentite ferite da questi termini, vi sono indifferenti o vi fanno piacere sentirveli dire. Ve lo chiedo perchè proprio oggi ho avuto una discussione che riguardava queste cose. Vi chiedo solo la massima sincerità in un senso o nell'altro. E una sorta di verifica nient'altro.

Ok.....I have been talkin 2 this guy for a couple weeks and he's really cool and whateva...I like him. but recently he asked me out on our first date and he wanted ME to come pick HIM up.....he told me that his mother had gone out of town with "the car" (which i'm guessing means that it's hers lol)....but anyway he wanted me to come to his house and pick him up for our date. Call me old school but i'm thinkin it should have been the other way around...with him comin to pick me up. and i know he said his mother was using the car or whatever but i think he should have waited until he had acess to a car before asking me out.....i don't know....call me old school but i like a guy coming to pick me up for our first date........What do you guys think???

I recently rekindled a frienship with  a woman who I have always had stong feelings for but never found the opportunity to express those feelings at least not outright. It was always a matter of one of being tied up in a relationship but both of us nevere single at the same time. I lost contact with her for almost four years due to some major upheavels in my life that required me to leave my locale for a good portion of that time . I came back and sought her out , we have spent much of our free time together. I finally put my card s on the table and her intial response was shock and silence. A few days later she apologized for leaving me hanging and explained how bad her lucjk with dating friends in the past has been but she also said she was not ruling it out  by any means but said  if something more develops from our time together  then cool. MY  question is  whos court does the ball lie. I don't want to screw up a great friendship but I also want progress in furthering our relations

20070708182342AAehnbp	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship help please?	Ok, I'm in a really big trouble. Two of my friends, let's call them A and B (I don't want to use real names), seem to hate each other now because of something that happened on a trip or something, (I wasn't there) and now A is shunning B and calling her all of this mean names. In return, B has been countering all of the insults and stuff. They both said that B ditched A on the trip. But A says only said that B ditched her. B also said that A was following her and her other friends everywhere and she didn't want that. A seemed to know that and kept following. So now they aren't even talking to each other. I don't know who to trust and who's telling the lie. What should I do?

20071028210838AArTFEm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I taking this thing too seriously?	I know that this is my third question about this girl, but if you guys didn't give such good advice I wouldn't keep posting em.  This girl who obviously has no issue with me (that is certain) told me a few days after we went to Homecoming that she didn't feel that she was ready to start dating any1.Now we're just friends, but I still like her. She is the first girl I've ever wanted to have as my girlfriend, so I have no prior experience in this stuff. I decided that I'll back off and just be friends until valentines day then send her flower/card w/poem and our homcoming pic etc.  and ask if she's ready.  My parents tell me that I'm taking it too seriously, and that GF's shouldn't be a big deal, and that i just need to find a girl to go to movies w/on weekends n stuff.  Are they right?  Am I blowing this out of proportion?  Do I just need to relax and find a girl who can do stuff with me? or am I right to think that i would really like this girl to be my first GF?

20071124192432AAASs0E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is He Insecure?	I'm a 40 somthing year old female, dating a 47 year old male for the last 2 months.  My past two boyfriends continue to call me which my current man believes causes friction with our relationship.          My current boyfriend feels that it is inappropriate for them to call me a couple of times a week.  I feel that they are my friends, and I don't have a problem with them calling.   One in particular still has romantic feelings for me, but I do not return his advances.        Am I wrong in feeling that my current boyfriend is over-reacting to these calls considering its only been two months?      One guy is a handyman and I feel comfortable having him work on my home, the other a business man, whom I have agreed to do some typing for.  My current man feels this is a farce, and that I'm just covering all the bases in the event it doesn't work out between us.      I think he is just insecure.  He feels that I'm just playing  him.

My next door neighbor was a bloke of 51 who had a tumor and has now got restricted use of his left arm. I first saw him as a dad i never had and felt sorry for him as my dad never had a lot to do with me he treated me nice and made me laugh and i told him my problems. My bloke had to go away to work for 5 weeks and i ended up moving in with the next door neighbor. He flew me to England to tell my bloke it was all over and he was gutted. I'm only 24 do you think Ive done the rite thing.

20080927220428AAxB6mS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when your ex boyfriend completely ignores you?	We broke up about 6 weeks ago. We haven't talked at all. We both avoid each other. If he sees me in the hall, he makes sure that we don't have to go near each other. Once he was at our mutual friends house, and he told my friend that he was hiding. In class, he just ignores me. One day, he did smile and wave, and a mutual friend told me that he was excited that we were cool again. But shortly after, it went back to normal. What does it mean when your ex boyfriend completely ignores you?
20090304062952AAgMoVG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help!  Should I help her?!?!?	I'm an event planner and a friend asked me to help her.  She refused to let me do it for her for free so we agreed on her paying me 5% of her budget which I usually charge 15% for full service wedding.  We had several meetings, I researched 4 countries and their laws on Catholic weddings as well as call the Catholic churches to see if it were possible to get married without being a member or resident of the country.  I purchased several phone cards as well.  Her family came to town for the holidays and decided she should use someone located in that country so she decided to go with that idea instead.  So all of my hard work (hours of research) and money spent on phone cards went down the drain.  She recently emailed me to say hi and to have me look over her budget and help finalize it and wants to discuss it with me.  How do I respond?  She's a friend, but not one that I talk to often and I feel like she dissed me after doing so much research, having 3 long meetings with her and her husband, and losing money.  What should I do?

I have a friend that is in the army and were always sending Emails when we can since his in Iraq. His feeling really down & really upset and I know that sometimes he acts more like a boyfriend then a friend. Since he always calls me baby & says that his thinking of me & he says that Im so beautiful furthermore he wants to take me out for coffee when his back at home I have only just met him & we have known each other for 3months & his having a hard time over there. I just feel really awful because there isn’t much I can say. I always send him funny jokes and Emails that just saying that I care & that Im here for him. Furthermore, that I want to be a Good friend so that he can be happy but I cant help but think that he might just be playing around with my mind???. Since he has many woman friends. I know his lonely but I just feel confused. The other day he sent me an Email saying that he was so depressed therefore I said that I was here if he needed a friend and that I was praying for him he then just said thanks baby I really thank you for everything baby and that is all he wrote back so I just said I was glad that he was ok and I just ended the converse and I said to take care. and then he Sent me another Email saying baby Im about to lose my mind. So I write back to him saying that it was ok, & that I was here, and that he could write to me anytime he wanted too and that he didn’t have to reply right away to my Emails. Because I know that his busy and he has other people that want to chat to him too do you think he likes me and that is why he did not want me to stop chatting with him because I don’t understand he has so many other friends why Me????         Thank you, for your time and Im so sorry that I write a lot I just need help

This friend of mine did not find out until the parent fell and had to go to the hospital. That the parent had cancer. The parent was in the hospital several days then released to go home with medication. The doctor says the parent will be more comfortable at home. This just doesn't sound good to me. From what I can tell. There may be resentment from this person later on. For not having been told the truth much sooner.

20090304070309AAZ2iQ6	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do you think this is a bit rude?  Destination wedding?	I just told my mother in law that we were not going to be attending my husband's step sister's wedding in Vegas since we live in NJ and can't afford it.  She says with relief that it's good someone else can not attend because her daughter whom is a single mom and has two small children can't afford to go and is very upset about it.  We will call her N.  So then I call N's sister B about something else and she starts talking about getting fitted for the wedding- she is in it.  I was floored!  So this bride is having her two full sister in the wedding and her one step sister B.  N can't afford to go so she doesn't get to be in the wedding but she is really upset about it.      My husband's comment was- Oh, well if you can't afford to go you can't be in it.  I just think his step sister is so rude for getting married in Vegas when everyone lives in NJ- it's like she is purposely separating people on incomes.  And the kicker if that she is paying for other people to go that she really wants there but people like us and my husband's sister are left on the side lines.      I know it's her wedding and she can do anything she wants but I don't want to attend her shower and give her a gift but I feel like I HAVE too.... because everyone will think it's rude if I don't.  But why should I feel obligated to give someone a gift whom doesn't give a hoot about the fact that people can't afford her extravagant wedding?  (it's 1,300 for a 4 day weekend trip).  Am I wrong for being a little bitter about it?  When I told her we might not be able to attend because of money reasons (we own two house now- trying to sell one) she just gave me this "blank" look.

20080201055531AA6Nk9d	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	E tu, che tipo di innamorata sei ?	Il nostro comportamento in amore svela tanto i nostri desideri quanto le nostre inibizioni. Riflette dunque il nostro essere più profondo e inconscio. Ci sono donne che non esitano a lasciarsi andare alla passione. Altre si lasciano guidare dalla loro intuizione femminile. Altre ancora preferiscono vivere il loro amore in modo più discreto. E tu  ????????????????
20080220151336AAe6vq9	Family & Relationships;Friends	La differenza --- VOI CHE NE PENSARE !!!!!!!?	L'atto sessuale per la donna è il coronamento di quel sentimento chiamato amore ed è per tale ragione la tappa finale del rapporto con il partner.   L'atto sessuale per l'uomo è la base, il tassello per dar vita ad un rapporto più profondo, più vero; dunque è la tappa iniziale dalla quale può (ma non è detto che accada) nascere l'amore.   La donna è per sua natura razionale. Ragiona, tuttavia, con il cuore quando è innamorata.   L'uomo invece è istintivo e poco perspicace. Ragiona, per lo più, con il suo "accessorio"      PS   ---    Se qualcuno dovesse contestare questa opinione qui impressa con la motivazione che spesso la differenza è data dai caratteri degli esseri umani, a costui rispondo che i caratteri possono essere l'eccezione alla regola ma anche la conferma di essa...

20080325134649AA4fQji	Family & Relationships;Friends	E’ opinione diffusa che le donne non amino l’avventura di una notte.?	Questo sembra essere il risultato dell’ennesimo sondaggio fatto su sesso e amore. Risulterebbe infatti che "l’incontro di una notte" coinvolge una percentuale bassissima delle donne, che sembra più orientato verso relazioni più lunghe (da sempre si dice che le donne sarebbero più romantiche e sentimentali e l’uomo invece ha meno problemi a fare sesso e basta).

Quelle ritenute fisicamente più attraenti mantengono standard alti.   Le bruttine risultano disposte ad accontentarsi, specialmente dopo i primi insuccessi. Questa situazione è analoga a quella di tutti gli uomini.

20080913042128AAJyhoa	Family & Relationships;Friends	La vita al contrario..?	   La vita dovrebbe essere vissuta al contrario.   Tanto per cominciare si dovrebbe iniziare morendo, e così tricchete tracchete il trauma è già bello che superato.   Quindi ti svegli in un letto di ospedale e apprezzi il fatto che vai migliorando giorno dopo giorno.   Poi ti dimettono perchè stai bene, e la prima cosa che fai è andare in posta a ritirare la tua pensione, e te la godi al meglio.   Col passare del tempo, le tue forze aumentano, il tuo fisico migliora, le rughe scompaiono.   Poi inizi a lavorare, e il primo giorno ti regalano un orologio d’oro.       Lavori quarant’anni finchè non sei così giovane da sfruttare adeguatamente il ritiro dalla vita lavorativa.   Quindi vai di festino in festino, bevi, giochi, fai sesso e ti prepari per iniziare a studiare.   Poi inizi la scuola, giochi con gli amici, senza alcun tipo di obbligo e responsabilità, finchè non sei bebè.   Quando sei sufficientemente piccolo, ti infili in un posto che ormai dovresti conoscere molto bene.   Gli ultimi 9 mesi te li passi flottando tranquillo e sereno, in un posto riscaldato con room service e tanto affetto, senza che nessuno ti rompa i c.o.g.l.i.o.n.i.   …E alla fine abbandoni questo mondo in un orgasmo....!

Im in a relationship of 11 years we have 2 children, for the past 5 years the relationship has been dead between us, I am trapped he will not leave because he says he will never leave his kids and if I want out I have to go.      The kids would be absoultley heartbroken if we split when we row they cry and beg us not to split up the relationship is destroying us all no one is happy.      He smokes weed everyday which I hate with a vengance I dont want my children growing up around it he says he doesnt smoke it in the house so its not an issue he just goes to work everyday comes home eats dinner smokes his weed and falls asleep until the kids go to bed he then wakes and stays up reallly late despite having to be up at 4.30am for work, he comes home and the scenario repeats.      I work part time and run the house solely, I manage the bills, cleaning ,cooking, kids, etc. I have no support he sees it that as I work part time I should do everything in the house which I agree to some extent but not all and help at weekends would be appriciated.      He has no interest in what me and the kids do or how we are, he never wants to talk.      I have spoken to him, cried and begged to help me as at times I feel so so low like I cant go on.      He just burys his headin the sand nothing happens he just carries on as normal I cant cope with this anymore please someone give me some advice I have nobody I can talk to about this.

20080221184051AA9G9IW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? Tries to hold my hand.. Comes over to talk to me...? Dance? HELP!?	I met Mark last year. My friends said he liked me last year, but I only took it as teasing (since friends always do that). Never really questioned it, brushed it off. They stopped after a few weeks.He'd walk me to class. Once, Mark followed me into class, and this guy I knew came over, gave me a hug, and whispered in my ear, "Is that your boyfriend?" Mark looked slightly pissed? sad? confused? and left shortly after. He didn't walk me to class for awhile after that.      We drifted apart a little at the beg. of the year. I've been talking to him again though. During lunch, he always waves at me, and sometimes comes over to talk. He sits nearby- but with this group of nice, but sort of dorky, badly dressed girls. (You know what I mean) I don't get it, since he's really athletic... shouldn't he have different friends? He tries to hold my hand a lot. I'll be walking by and he'll stick out his hand in front of me, and I don't want to mean, so I'll take it, but let go after a few seconds.
20090227023222AA7b2kQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she really likes me or just wants my attention?	There's this girl in my university and we had eye contact for 2 years and 4 weeks ago we started talking. I really like her and she likes me too.   but after 1 week a guy came and said he loves her and he kind of threatened me. I told her about him and told her what he said to me but she said there's nothing going on between them.So i was happy till one day that i saw her laughing and talking very warm to that guy.I asked her about him and she said it's alright and they're just friends.   this guy and she are in the same class but i am in a different class. It seems to me that she's lying to me and they're having a relationship.3 weeks ago she's kind of started ignoring me.but i had some doubt about that.So one day i offered her some E-books and she refused to get them.Another day i offered her to participate with me in the project that we have for our course. But she said she already chose her teammate.Before i talk to her, i knew that guy and she are friends.But apparently she didn't know that he loves her, and now she knows. I thought everything is over and i started not to talk to her and just said 'hello' to her and i acted very cool for about 2 weeks. But about 3 days ago i realized that she's trying to get my attention and she's trying to have a conversation with me (and she's with that guy too). What shoud i do? Should i stop ignoring her? Is she playing with me? Does she really likes me or just wants my attention? Should i wait a little more or start a relationship with her?

Like you wait for her, help her keep her stuff etc. You wait for her so you can walk together and chat. When she bumps into you or touches your hand on accident, you don't move away. You ask her stuff about her school life.      Ok. That's what my friend does. And this is besides stuff like looking at me when we're in a group, smiling at me with eye contact. observing me in class. and saying stuff like "i saw you yesterday!" with a big smile. trying to tease me using my name.       But the thing is, sometimes he's chatty, especially when I am and if we are in a group. when we are alone, he can be quiet and doesn't really look at me. or when I'm not smiling or seem to be preoccupied, he doesn't chat much as well... =/      whats going on? need some opinions. thanks!
20081107214757AALJGi8	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend got grounded...is it fair?	OK, so me adn my friends went to see a movie, and half-way through the movie, we decided it wasn't good, and so we ditched it, and went walking around outside (we live in small town) and it is lit up with adults... so anyway my friends mom had to my friend to call her when we got out of the movies, and my friend didnt, until the movie got out, but we had done been out for about an hour, before the movie actually got out, anyway so it turns out my friends mom, was there watching us from her van, and we didn't know it. So because my friend didn't call her mom, her mom took her phone, and when she got it my friend recieved a text with a cuss word, and so my friend's mom is taking her texting away, for good, and may not or may get her phone back, just for calling. also becuase of that my friend is not allowed to date until she is 16.... is this punishment fair, or could her mom been a little nicer?

20081108025523AAhTaHT	Family & Relationships;Family	Dad's Girlfriend Problem?	In March, my parents divorced, and since about April, then my dad has had a slovakian grlfriend called Kvetka. She is very nice, but she does not speak good english, and she does annoy me unintentionally sometimes. I think she is going to be moving in with us soon, even though I don't want her to, seeing as she lives at our house atleast 5 days a week.      Today, my dad and I were going to go out and buy me some new clothes, just the two of us, without my brother. He was going to stay at home. I was looking forwards to the time with just the two of us, because I honestly don't think that I can remember the last time we spent together just the two of us. I also wanted to talk to him about some things. So overall, I have been looking forwards to it all week.       However, today my dads girlfriends Kvetka has invited herself along. She was going to stay home too, but now she wants to come. I said to my dad, does she have to come and he said well she wants to.      I really don't want her to come because I wanted to spend time with just me and my dad, and also I know she will annoy me, and it will be really embarassing in the shops with her because she will ask me if I like everything, and I will have to explain no I don't in 2 year old sentences, because that is all she understands.      How can I tell my dad/ Kvetka that I really don't want her to come, without causing a big fuss or upsetting everybody?

I know guys sometimes worry loads about meeting a girls parents but what dyou reckon is harder? Do you think its harder for a guy to meet a girls parents, or for the girl to meet the guys parents?      Or dyou think its pretty even?      (reason im asking is cus im meeting my boyfriends parents later and im actually bricking it! i have no idea what to say/do or what not to say/do! any help or advice would be appreciated, lol)
20081117141119AAEAd0E	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think it'd be possible to track down my old french penpal from school?	I know this sounds bizarre cus I'm only 18 but I had this awesome french penpal back when I was about 9, and we kept writing to each other for ages but I kind of stopped when I got a couple of years into high school (when i was about 13).      I could tell you her name and what town she lived in but i dont know if thats much use. I've tried searching her name on myspace, bebo, facebook etc but nothing shows up...so she might not have either/private/some other networking site i havent tried yet.      Any idea where I could start my search?! Would be awesome - thanks :D      She'd be about 18/19 now, but we had loads in common and would be cool to catch up and see what she's up to now :')
20081030194537AApbFiP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know when you love someone and when to say it?	Argh, help! I'm in my first relationship and I have no idea how they work so I'm just sort of seeing where it takes me. But it's awesome so far.      Thing is...me and my boyfriend always tease each other saying 'I hate you...' like, in a jokey way (cant be bothered to explain the whole thing behind it...we just get it xD) but in the last week or so I've sort of felt he was trying to say something else. And I sort of got the feeling he thought the same for me and he's kind of right. So tonight when I said' I haaaate you' to him, laughing, instead of saying 'i hate you too' or 'i know ^^' he said 'i love you too'...and i was like 'awhh :')'      but then i got stuck. noones ever said 'i love you' to me before (never been in a relationship before - duh! lol) and ive never said it to anyone. and i didnt want to say it back just because he said it to me. but i dont really understand what love is it, but i sort of feel like i do love him. i have done this past week. so instead of saying i love you back i kind of wrote 'I L Y' on his forehead with my finger (not with pen, just outlining letters) and made him figure it out. and he knew what i was trying to say and he told me on msn after that he understood and also he knew the first time saying it is always hard cus he's never said it before either.      i dont wanna rush into things, but i dont wanna lose him either. i dont know when to actually say it out loud, but i'll say it when im ready to, right?       also, if this makes any difference...ive only known him for three weeks, and we've been going out for almost three. so we werent actually friends first, we sort of just hit it off and let things work out however they worked out xD

Me and my friend Tyler just started talking again we've decided that we are going to be acquaintances [not close friends] its working its just idk what to do he doesnt like talking about the past like when he treated me like crap and talking to me like crap,not telling me he had a gf, and the thing i dont get is why he even bothered to have a gf when he loved me of course he doesnt now i dont think he like likes me either but of course if i asked him he wouldnt answer me i told him i dont like like him anymore and of course i dont love him. i called him last weekend that was fun but a little awkward and sunday he didnt answer but i dont think he wanted to talk to me three days in a row cant blame him. He said he didnt mean to hurt me i think i believe it but why did he do it then? I cant even trust him anymore, we never dated always been friends i never see him i just mostly talk to him online or the phone. i dont want this to go bad again were good friends, and i dont know what i would do if i like liked him and loved him again.   but question is what should i do now?   talk to him online and on the phone once in a while or talk to him whenever i feel like it?

He used to tell me he missed me, loves me and he think i am beautiful all the time. Now it's been few weeks that he didnt say these things anymore. Do you think he doesn't think them anymore?

20080205082007AAOvFxc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help to get over a girl!?	So I recently studied abroad for 3 months in Europe (I am in college), while I was there i met this amazing girl and we have a good 3 week fling.   I have a girlfriend and it was more of an affair i guess.  The girl lives in Ohio and I am in New York.  She has said many times that in no way does she want a relationship with me, but wants friends with benefits.  I cant stop thinking of her though and its destroying my relationship with my current girlfriend.  I spoil the other girl buying her plane tickest to new york and taking her to broadway plays and out to dinner.  When we are together she acts like we are truly together with cuddling and physical contact alot.  I am going to see her next month but I want to be able to just go there and be normal about it.  Im in college and its affecting not only my school work but my relationship here with my current girlfriend.  What should I do, and I dont want the other girl to be completely out of my life

20080210062644AAr19KZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is being a submissive right for me?	I love my Master to control me 24/7.  In the bedroom is the best part.  However when I want my own way and my Master won't give it to me i.e. if I wanted to buy a top that he didn't like when we were out shopping, then he really puts his foot down and I feel like he doesn't love me because he isn't letting me have my own way.  The other example is that if I get too trappy on the phone or rude to him in a MUCKING about manner, he does tend to give me a warning but sometimes I carry on and then I get punished i.e. he will give me 400 lines to do by a particular date.  The problem is that it makes me feel really horrible when I get punished and then he makes me feel really bad.  I love the bedroom side with the s&m such as the bondage etc.  It is just when I play up and get punished that makes me feel like rubbish.  The thing is I love him controlling me and doming me and telling me what to do so I don't understand what the problem is?

20080430224830AAKll4Q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	We both want seperation but im scared?	My wife and me have been having problems for awhile. The begining of the marriage I had a hot temper and called her foul names out of anger. I have learned to control my temper and have not called her names anymore. I grew up in a rough house and didn't know it was so hurtfull till we had some heart to hearts. I shrugged off the name calling when I was little so I thought she could. Now she wants me to move so we can grow and she can get her confidence back. My belittling of her has made her doubt herself. She says she can't bring herself to forgive me for the past. I believe she wants to work things out but I'm afraid that a seperation will lead to the end of our marriage. I love her and regret what I have done. I at first told her I would change, but now I am trying to show it. I make good money am will help her while I pay rent somewhere else. I am also afraid I will build some anger up of being kicked out and having to waste money on rent, when I have a house.
20080501092442AA1sItj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does ugly coming from him, really mean I'm ugly??	Ok there's this guy in my biology class, and he's always talking to me, like tapping me from behind, we talk about random things, but I never start the conversation with him. However, recently, he's started to call me ugly, and he'll laugh, and I'll say thanks. I don't know why he does it, but he does. And I don't understand it because he talks to me a lot, but he still acts mean to me. Like if he sees me around he'll push me (as a joke or whatever and we just smile). I really don't understand if the term "ugly" used by him is actually a joke or he seriously means it. I've also said he looks worse and he said thanks I appreciate it, but it's like he knew I was joking. I just want to know if he's joking or not.   Thanks.   (Btw, I have low self esteem, sometimes I think I look really good sometimes I think I look ugly, but I get the term "pretty" used to describe me often, and I do get hit on, so overall I'd say I'm okay)

20081023090541AA3yvYX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think it's true that women go less for looks than men?	I am reading a book which claims women are more attracted to status and a confident attitude than looks in men, whereas looks are by far the most important thing to men when assessing attractiveness in females.      I know that this cannot be true all the time because many good looking women seem to go on social networking sites and surround themselves with guys who are good looking or very pretty facially type of guys. As for men, I have also seen many good looking men with women who are probably not that good looking.      Do women prefer a guy of a similar level in attractiveness, or does it matter to them?      Please nobody mention millionaire men as an example or "beauty is in the eye....".

20080706205522AAFzifG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is kissing a girl on lip or any foreplay without any act of intercourse means loosing virginity?	I had a girl friend during college days but we could not reach upto marriage. But we had kissed a number of times during our courtship. My wife believe if I have kissed any girl before marriage then I have lost virginity. I don't think so as when kissing, you are just expressing your love towards your partner. It may not have any connection to sex. Also these college days crushes is very comman with most boys and girls. It'll mean most boys or girls loose their virginity before marriage. What do girls in India believe? Is my wife very conservative or I am a bit more modern?

20081003132336AAO6JCu	Family & Relationships;Friends	I′ve always have felt a strange pleasure about being tied up, do you think it′s odd or wicked?	Since I was a little girl I felt some attraction about damsels being captured in movies or cartoons by bad guys, I used to imagine myself like them, tied and gagged waiting for my hero to rescue me ... I′m now 22 and I still got some strange feeling about being tied and gagged, I do enjoy it, in a very odd way      I know it may be linked to a sexual behavior, but it is not my case, not at all, it has nothing to do with a sexual behavior... I just like to be tied up and gagged and feel myself helpless like a princess in distress      So I′ve got 3 questions about this:      1.- There′s some psychological explanation about this pleasure?   2.- Am I the only person on this planet who likes to be tied up?   3.-Do you think it′s odd or wicked? I mean, if I were your friend and told you this little secret of mine, would you quit being my friend because of this?      Thanks, kisses to everyone

20081018195954AA3Y1eH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I dump my boyfriend?	I've been with him for about 6 months and we have become very close. Lately I have had some struggles in my life, such as a death of a friend and excessive stress from school. It's no surprise to me that I've become pretty depressed. I've never felt this crappy before. I didn't say anything until tonight when I just started crying and telling him how bad I feel. He wanted to go to a city an hour away with his friends, and I knew about it, but I wasn't trying to manipulate him or anything by breaking down tonight of all nights. Afterward all I wanted was for him to stay with me so I could feel comforted. When I asked him what he was going to do tonight he said I would get sad if he went with his friends (obviously)... but he went anyway and left me alone. I think this means he doesn't respect me or care about my feelings. On the other hand I don't know if I'm just overreacting because I feel so down. I don't want to regret it later. Thanks

Im going away to grad school next year two states over and I know we wouldn't last with the distance. We barely saw each other and we live five minutes apart. I know that we shouldn't get back together but I just miss him so bad. Like it's been a month and i still go to bed in tears when I think about him. I've tried talking, counseling, writing, crying a lot, talking to people, keeping myself busy, talking to other guys, everything. It just doesn't help. I'm still just as miserable as the day we broke up. I miss him and i want him back but I don't want to go thru this twice.       I mean Ive had heart breaks before but nothing like this before, ever. usually after a month I just either don't care or Ive moved on to that stage of "He was crappy anyways" Him I just miss and miss and miss more.

But she just wont commit to me yet.. stating that she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now or ever again... Keep in mind she just got out of a 4 years relationship[ back in June. but there were so many break-ups in that relationship it didn't go smooth the 4 years.... Yes i know that could be it, but she is always calling me, sleeping with me, doing everything with me.... even going to Canada with me in December... She often states that she wishes she met me a long time ago cause then she would have commited rigt away.. She just says that she just dont want it right now... but as we all know, actions speak louder then words...and her actions do not follow her words of not wanting a relationship. She tried to show she didn't and that lasted for 2 days.. lol My question is .. wills he eventually commit to me.. or am i just wasting my time.. She has told he she loves me... and would potentially marry me if she could just commit? Now the past 2 weeks she has become very close with me.. doesn't talk like she is single anymore and she is very touchy feely and cuddly I have met her mother and i met her friends.

Ma secondo l'avvocato di lui e l'avvocato di mia madre a 16 anni non possono più dirmi niente se voglio stare con lui.   Ma io non ho un bel rapporto con mia madre, perchè abbiamo litigato tantissimo per lui e per tanti altri motivi, quindi volevo chiedere secondo voi posso andare a vivere con lui ai miei 16 anni perchè io veramente sto letteralmente sclerando con lei...   I miei sono separati quindi non so proprio come gestirmi nemmeno con mio padre!!!   Io ho un brutto raporto sia con mia madre che con mio padre!!!   Io e il mio ragazzo stiamo insieme da 5 mesi circa, ma non sto dicendo di andarci a vivere ora, ma semplicemente l'anno prossimo secondo voi è fattibile???
20090227164444AApYBwN	Family & Relationships;Friends	La gente mi evita..perche?	Ciao a tutti mi chiamo Gaetano e ho 22 anni.   Da sempre la gente mi evita cosi' mi rinchiudo nella mi camera e piango.   Io non riesco proprio a capire il perche...eppure sono simpatico..sono come gli altri!   Colleziono francobolli e schede telefoniche.   Spesso invito addirittura i miei amici a casa ma essi pur di non venire si lacerano le bracci con le forbici.   Una volta Michele mi ha confessato che ha sentito voci che io puzzo..ma non e' vero! Mamma dice che profumo di campagna. Le lacrime scendono a fiotti.   Un giorno 4 anni fa ho deciso di conservarle, cosi' ho preso un barattolo ermetico e ogni volta che piango, piango all' interno di esso.   Sopra c'e' attaccata una figurina di Naruto, il mio cartone animato preferito, perche' lui e' il migliore! Conosce piu' di 67 mosse di karate...watatata...e ti colpisce col misterioso pugno magico!   Neanche ai professori piace la mia passione per i manga.   Cosa devo fare? Sono disperato..vi prego amici dell' allegro forum/chat di answer...aiutatemi

20090304070240AAq1jco	Family & Relationships;Family	How to deal with an obsessive Mother-in-Law?	Me and my fiance have been together for three years and his mother is very jealous of our relationship.  She is too attached to her son (its freaking disgusting), she calls him atleast 5-10 times a day to see "what he is doing".  She is always putting me down about my weight, she says I am too skinny and I need to eat (I am 5'3" and 120 lbs).  The funny  thing is.. when I first met her she was 5'2" and 106 lbs and now she put on a bunch of wieght because her doctor put her on steroids.  Anyways she constantly is in our business, she asks her son how much we have in our checking account, she asks him if I have started my period, she asks anything and everything personal you can think of!!  The problem is... my fiance does not know how to tell her when it is none of her business, he is afraid of hurting her feelings all the time.  When he does get the balls to say something she holds things over his head (like how much she has done for him over the years) and she starts crying to make him feel bad. His stepdad is in the secret service and she is constantly rubbing how much they make a year in our face and MY parents faces!  She copies everything from me to what I wear to the decor of our house.  Also, whenever I tell him things that are supposed to be just between me and him... he ends up telling her.. and I dont find out until she says something to me.  I try not to nag to him about how she makes me feel, but sometimes I cant help it., and when I do try and tell him how I feel, HE ALWAYS sticks up for her, which makes me feel worse!  He is the only child... and I want him and his mother to have a good relationship... why does she not want the same for me and him?   Sorry I went on and on, but three years of bottling it all up... I am going to burst!!

20090305061601AA6HEM7	Family & Relationships;Family	Parent needs advice about my boyfriend please!?	Not for a teens interest, adults please respond....      Doesn't matter what the issue, even when I know I am in the right and it is crystal clear to the world at large, my so called boyfriend will always play devils advocate and stand up for the other person/situation if an issue arises.    There's a woman in the neighborhood that is notorious for her selfish ways. ("all about her" type). I pick up her children for school each morning (I also bring my own) . I went today and waited at there house for the kids to come out like I have done every day of the year (snow, rain, etc) and finally figured out that they weren't even there. She had decided to drive them today I guess. That's her option of course-- but not so much as a phonecall to me to let me know. So I passed her in the school parking lot and on our own side street in our vehicles and I slowed down to talk to her, and she drove fast right on by. It was intentional.    So I told my bf about this, who always says she's a witch (unless of course it's me complaining) So I tell him and he says "well maybe she wanted to teach you a lesson that if you say you will pick her kids up at 8:00 than she means 8 sharp." I said "I'm doing her a FAVOR by picking up her kids each day, no charge, just a neighborly good thing to do. The kids have never been late, always greeted warmly and dropped off with a smile. Why would she feel she had the right or need to "teach me a lesson?".    My bf then started on his long stupid rampage about "understanding the other person"... I just blew up at him saying you don't even understand ME nevermind HER! What the f--    For ONCE I'd like him to just stand by me on ANYTHING and not always challenge me.      I am from a very loyal family. Brought up to have my have friends family back. Of course,We speak to eachother honestly but in the end we stand together. I don't feel this security from my bf. I don't expect my bf to do anything about the mother or get involved but in the privacy of my own kitchen I'd like some understanding.    He consistantly puts me on the stand for cross examination. I want an emotionally loyal man. Not one that will agree with me ALL the time, but one that will at least be supportive when I am just looking for some encouragement or comfort or to feel a little protected.... One that will not blame me for things he clearly KNOWS are not my fault. I think it's a passive aggressive way of putting me down. I think he is undermining who I am by disagreeing and belittling and turning around any situation that I have a complaint on. What do you think?

20061217140743AAfShYt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is so bad about being alone?	I have no interest in getting a girl. I can't get the confidence to ask one out.I will never ask a girl out. I am just waiting for a girl to approach me. If a girl likes me, she should approach me. I know I would be rejected and then it would not be worth it. I like a girl, but my anxiety is holding me back from talking to her, and I don't feel like changing my anxiety, although I know it might make me depressed, kind if. I don't really feel like I deserve to be loved. And, I wouldn't really want to be around a girl for my whole life, as it is my life, and about me.

Total, que hace 2 meses resultó que su cu?ada ya no queria que se lo regresaramos sino que se lo pagaramos como nuevo, en un principio estuve de acuerdo, pero ayer me dijeron que me iban a cambiar a una comunidad más cerca y pues creo que es justo que la otra que llegue en mi lugar sea la que lo pague, si yo ya no voy a estar no veo porque pagarlo, a lo mejor dar un proporcional pero no la cuarta parte.

This is my middle grown child of 5 and oldest son. The one I have always felt the closest to as far as sharing,understanding,helping,closeness and etc. He is the one I refered to as my rock and his Dad and I felt good knowing we had him to call on in an emergency. I am 76, husband is 80 an we are still active. Son's wife got offended at me after son borrowed  $85,000. to get himself out of debt. I said she didn't need a housekeeper, I never had one, and now we arn't welcome in her house and in defense of her he has drug up every slight she can think of to mention in an email to me in hopes that the relationship be mended. I no longer see this son in the same light, I have been a good Mother and I don't deserve to be put down. I have a good personality and meant no harm, only a way to save. This Son is the trustee of our Living Trust. We are changing that. It hurts to write this but we never know how life will turn out.   God Bless You All and Have a Wonderful Christmas & 2007

20070109151115AAFyvXm	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Warum diese Gewalt & dieser Hass?	Hallo,      Mein Freund (und Lebensgef?hrte) liegt seit einigen Stunden im Krankenhaus.   Er war noch heute abend in unserer ?rtlichen Schwulenkneipe und hat dort nur ein Bier getrunken - und als er auf dem Weg nach Hause wollte, wurde er von 5 oder 6 M?nnern brutal getreten, zusammengeschlagen und noch ausgeraubt - bis er bewusstlos am Boden lag.   Ihm sind mehrere Z?hne herausgeschlagen worden, sein Nasenbein ist zertrümmert, die Sch?deldecke stark in Mitleidschaft geraten - warscheinlich wird er bleibende Sch?den und Verletzungen davontragen.  Jedenfalls sind das die Zeugenaussagen von anderen Passanten.      Ich verstehe die Welt nicht mehr.  Nur weil man schwul ist, wird man einfach so brutal zusammengeschlagen und vielleicht bis ans Lebensende ein Krüppel???  Was hat mein Freund getan? Was soll der Scheiss?  Er (und ich) sind schwul - na und???    Wen st?rt es?   Wir tun niemandem etwas und dennoch begegnet uns oft Gewalt und Hass...

20071114171647AA9izWp	Family & Relationships;Friends	Miralo... Esto es increible?	New York City tiene 11 letras.       2) Afghanistan tiene 11 letra       3) Ramsin Yuseb ( El terrorista que amenazó con destruir las Torres Gemelas en 1993) tiene 11 letras.       4) George W Bush tiene 11 letras.             Esto puede ser pura coincidencia, pero ahora se pone mas interesante             1) New York es el estado numero 11.       2) El primer avión que se estrelló contra las Torres Gemelas fue el vuelo numero11.       3) El vuelo numero 11 llevaba 92 pasajeros. 9 +2 = 11       4) El vuelo numero 77 también se estrelló contra las T Gemelas, y llevaba       65 pasajeros. 6+5 = 11       5) La tragedia sucedió el 11 de Septiembre, o mejor dicho 9/11. 9+1+1=11       6) El día es igual al numero de emergencia de la policía en Estados Unidos       911. 9+1+1 =11. Pura coincidencia???             Sigue leyendo y ya me contarás.       1) El numero total de victimas dentro de todos lo aviones fue de 254. 2+5+4= 11.       2) El 11 de Septiembre es el día 254 del calendario. Otra vez 2+5+4=11.       3) Las explosiones de Madrid sucedieron el día 3/11/2004. 3+1+1+2+4= 11.       4) La tragedia de Madrid sucedió 911 días después del incidente de las Torres Gemelas 9+1+1=11....             Bueno, ahora es cuando las cosa se pone mas misteriosa.             Uno de los símbolos mas reconocidos de Estados Unidos, después de las Estrellas y las Barras, es el águila.       La siguiente estrofa ha sido sacada del Quran, el libro sagrado Islamita "Por que se ha escrito que el hijo de Arabia despertará a una terrible Aguila. La fuerza del águila se sentirá por todas las tierras de Allah, mientras algunas personas temblarán en desesperación pero en el fondo se alegrarán: por que la fuerza del Aguila limpiará las tierras de Allah y abrá paz."       ésa estrofa es la numero 9.11 del Quran.             Todavía no estás convencido....?!       Intenta lo siguiente y luego me cuentas, se me a puesto el pelo de punta:             Abre el Microsoft Word y haz lo siguiente:             1. Escribe en mayúscula Q33 NY. éste es el numero de vuelo del primer avión que se estrelló contra las Torres Gemelas.       2. Sombrea el Q33 NY.       3. Cambia el tama?o a 48.       4. Cambia la letra a WINGDINGS.             Y AHORA QUE PIENSAS ?!?!!?             Impresionante no?? te recomiendo q entre a microsoft word y compruebes eso... Esta impresionante...

20090227024512AAJEA8F	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How much of women's cheating is due to motive and how much opportunity?	I think it's 95% opportunity and 5% motive. in other words, if a woman has the best opportunity to cheat (can't be discovered, hot attractive guy to cheat with etc), she most likely will. Do you agree? I think even the happily married women would consider cheating if they were in the 'right' situation (or wrong situation, depending on your perspective)

20081020094137AAL4vga	Family & Relationships;Family	Was I in the wrong for saying this last night?	First I want to say this, My fiance and i are getting married on oct 31 @9:30am at the JP office. I'm 34 weeks and 2 day's pregnant and was already in the hospital on wednesday, because i thought i was in labor.Right now,my fiance and i are both living at his mother's house paying her $400 a month and i've been doing the house work ever since i moved in and that was a year ago and i'm told not to do it anymore by the nurse's and ob/gyn's at the hospital but i still do it so they (my fiance,his brother,and mother) won't be down each other's throats. We've been looking around for a place and the only place we can afford right now is these apartments here in shippensburg,pa, that the rent cost's $440-$465 for a 2 bedroom apartment that rent pays all utilities besides electric,But the next apartment available is in Feb of 2009.      My fiance's brother Travis moved in on Dec 12 of 2007, he is not working, he hasn't worked since Dec 29 of 2007, and that is because they fired him,he does not clean,and he does not pay rent.All he does is sleep all day,eat the house up, even if we are low on food,bring his girlfriend over, who's been here for almost 2 weeks now,take his mom and my fiance back and forth to work and sometimes take me to the doctors and the store, to cash a wic check,After he brings my fiance home and takes his mom to work he goes with his girlfriend to her house in his moms car, which is a 45 min drive from here,then at midnight when his mom gets off work, they come home and make a lot of noise waking us all up,the noise continues 'till my fiance's brother and his girlfriend are done Talking,taking a shower,having sex, and fighting. It's that way every single night.      Last night we had enough, we go to bed at 9pm and have to wake up at 5am for my fiance to go to work. They started making a lot of noise at 12:30am,they were in the living room on the love seat on the lab top computer, being little kids,and we asked nicely "will you guys keep it down out there?" and they said "yeah". So my fiance's mom goes to bed at 1am,then you hear them two again on the computer again doing the same shitt all over and we asked them again nicely to shut up and we got the same answer, Then at 1:56am we hear them two fighting and that is what pissed us off, we yelled "SHUT THE FFFUCK UP OUT THERE"  Then they said "sorry" then like 4 mins later they turn on the shower and my fiance started yelling and said "NO, YOU AINT GETTING A SHOWER NOW" and his brother said "I'm going to do whatever the hell i want" Then my fiance said "WELL,SHE NEEDS TO GO THE HELL HOME THEN" and my fiance's brother's girlfriend said fine and started packing her stuff and my fiance's brother told her well made her stay and started screaming at my fiance and that's when i yelled "WHY DON'T YOU ALL SHUT THE FFFUCK UP IT'S 2 O'CLOCK IN THE FFFFUCKING MORNING,SO SHUT THAT DAMN DOOR AND SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Then we got some sleep 'till we heard them having sex at 3:30am in the morning, I didn't fall asleep 'till 4 and my fiance woke me up at 5am.      I went back to bed at 6:30am this morning then at 10am my fiance calls me from his cell phone at work telling me that on the way to work his brother was talking shitt about me,and my fiance wouldn't tell me what all he said, all my fiance said was if he was to tell me i will be so up set to where my water will brake.       Then at 11am i go to the kitchen to go get something to eat so i can take my prenatal, my mother in law to be told me i should have never got involved last night and let them 2 fight it out, and i told her straight up, " I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THE BULLSHITT GOING ON, I,ANDREW (my fiance), AND ANYONE ELSE IN THIS WORLD, HAS A FFFUCKING RIGHT TO LIVE IN PEACE AND QUIET AND GET SOME SLEEP WITHOUT BEING WOKING UP,AND YEAH I KNOW TRAVIS (my fiance's brother) HAS A PROBLEM WITH ME, IF HE DON'T LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY, THEN HE DON'T NEED TO TALK TO ME".     Then i went back to the room and i've been here ever since.      I know this is a long freaking question and it is all drama but this is what i have to live with for about another 3 to 4 months unless something happens like if we can find a place sooner then Feb, or his brother moving out.       I understand that this isn't my house and i shouldn't act like i'm running it,but when it come's them stealing my sleep when i need it then your going to see a HUGE BITTCH WHO IS 8 ALMOST 9 MONTHS PREGNANT.        Wouldn't you do the same thing if this was going on where you lived at?      Was i wrong for telling them to shut up?      What do you think we should do besides what we are trying to do already (move out)?   
20090305062007AAZiTbY	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do I'm so mad at my friend?	So this year I am graduating from high school and an so excited not because of graduating but because my loved ones are all coming to see me. I recently heard that my cousins cannot come because they have to start summer school in Hawaii in order to be accepted into this intense private school. I am so unhappy because I am so close to them and they are disappointed too.      I am so upset that I begin telling my sophomore friend about this on fb chat. First of all she doesn't say anything like "I'm sorry". Instead she says this:      this stinks   and i know you're going to drag me against my will to your graduation      I tell her no because I don't want to force people to come. It means more if they come because they want to. She then says "good" and moves on. She says she'll give me a graduation party but that isn't the same. I am so angry with her.       She says that she doesn't want to come because she hates how teachers make speeches about how good school was. I told her that's what they do at graduation. It's a tradition. She still doesn't want to come.       It's bad enough that my cousins can't come but it's worse when my friend who lives in this town doesn't want to come. She is so selfish.

20090227030823AAZkufb	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I apologize anyway?	My aunt and I used to be best friends but our friendship became strained when she met this new guy and though I have never liked him I tolerated him despite all he did to undermine me at every turn. He is a nasty piece of work he has dropped their children at my house claiming to be back by 10pm & arriving at 3am expecting to wake them & go home. Anyway to make a long story short he stole some money from my husband 2 years ago & I wrote a very nasty e-mail to her about it. Now that things are fine with her and I he told his kids that they are not allowed to talk to me because I am a B****. This really upset me as it has nothing to do with the kids. Though my husband was mad as hell he was big enough to say that it would be put in the past so long as he apologized & now my aunt & her man have said that he wont apologize if I don't for my e-mail. Should I be the bigger person & let everything go & apologize for the e-mail I sent?

MUM says that she will let me have a bikini of another style, but it will be more practical What do you think ?

20090227024847AA6xP4z	Family & Relationships;Friends	My 15 year old daughter said something nasty about her best friend to another friend?	She read the text and found out that my daughter said some stuff about her.     I agree that its my daughter's fault for back biting and I suppose she will learn from her mistakes and wont be doing this kind of thing again in a hurry.     Worse part is that they all use to hang around together and now my daughter feels uncomfortable as that girl talks through her and its really awkward.  My daughter has two options according to her.  She can either carry on like this being ignored or leaves this group and go to her other friends who are not in the same group.  She has apologised  to her friend and she knows she was wrong.  But that girl does not want to know.      She wants to know what she should do.  She would love to be her friend again but she thinks its impossible now and that they will never be friends again.

20090227025749AAd7ZzV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Convince my girlfriend to let me drink?	Here's the problem: this summer, I'm going to a festival with my friends, and we're probably going to consume a lot of alcohol. Since I'm underage (17), and therefore are not really allowed to drink, my girlfriend doesn't want me to drink. However, this has been planned for a long time, and I really would like to go (and drink). She believes that I'm going to do something stupid, like cheat on her while being drunk. I know that I'm not going to do something like that, since I've been drunk during our relationship, and nothing happened.       The thing is that me and my friends have been spending less and less time together, since I've been with my gf. This is a big opportunity for me to catch up with my friends, and spend time together with them, do something fun. Since all of them is going to drink, it's either all or nothing: go there and drink, or stay home and miss the party of the year.       Is there any way I can convince her to let me go? Please help me, all answers are welcome.

20090227030138AA3Fu7o	Family & Relationships;Family	I Need help with smoking problem?	Ok heres what happened, about 10 months ago my mom caught me smoking a cigarette. I had smoked on and off for a little while, she got really upset and lectured me on cigarettes, then started insinuating I did drugs because I smoked. She thought I was smoking pot and doing acid, both of which I didn't.    After awhile she cooled down, and after a few months I started smoking again on occasion (stupid I know). Then about two months ago I realized I had a problem and quit. Well last night I was hanging out with a friend and he asked me to hold onto his cigarettes for the night (his family doesn't know he smokes), this morning I started smoke a cig just to remind myself what it tastes like after not smoking for a couple weeks (it tastes really bad), and my came home from work for something and saw me smoking through our porch door. I told he I only smoked on rare occasion with my friends and this was just one I got from a friend. Once again she got upset and started insinuating I also smoke crack and pot. How do I convince her that just because someone occasionally smoke a cig doesn't mean they do drugs? I also gotta somehow explain to her that I only smoked on occasion and was truly stopping, so if you have any experience with something like that any help would be great.

20061209110234AAuH2TA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does the character of a man actually matter to a woman?	I'm looking for serious answers here. Nothing along the lines of "duh" or "of course".      I'm just wondering, because I haven't been able to find a woman who thinks that it's important for a man to live his life with integrity. Most women that I know think that it's great when a man is unfaithful, lazy, bullying, and dishonest in general. They view him as being a "bad boy" who has "edge" and is a "challenge".      On the other hand, a man who is confident, mentally and physically healthy, a community leader, intelligent, romantic, honest, and would be a devoted husband and father, is seen as "boring" and "too nice".       Why is this? Do these women have low self-esteem and think that they don't deserve better . . . or, do men of integrity have to start being losers in order for women to appreciate them?      I look forward to your intelligent and well-thought-out answers

20070115160353AA4FpcJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can i tell my best friend that i'm in love with her?	We've been friends about five years and now we are really good friends. But two years ago I started to fall in love with her. Sometimes I think she shouldn't know because I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I really need to tell her, I'm getting crazy about it.   I promised myself that I'll do it next time we're alone, but today in the morning, we were talking in our classroom, only she and me, and I couldn't tell her a word!!! I'm sure she noticed something weird because she asked me what was wrong with me and then a boy entered in the classroom. I just told her, "Believe me. You don't want to know."    And then she wanted me to tell her what happened but I didn't. I hope next time I can do it because I can't bear it anymore, I need to tell her even though I'm sure she doesn't feel the same way about me.   Can anybody give me an advice please?

I dont want her to be depressed) but I dont know how to do that without her misunderstanding me and assuming I think she is fat or something like that      how can I help her? or should I leave it alone? I just dont want her to break down over that again, I think she looks beautiful the way she is, but I want her to feel confident and good about herself.      please... serious answers

20081017132757AAIztrI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	?MUJERS QUE OPINAN DE ESTO? A veces nuestros hombres parecen ni?os..?	Saben   Muchas veces nos cuenta entender a los hombres, pero bueno somos dos géneros diferentes y por lo tanto distintos.  Pero algunas veces me saca de casillas esas actitudes tontas de mi marido que más que parecer un hombre de 37 a?os parece un ni?o malcriado.  Ayer por ejemplo me dice q casi no tenemos combustible en el carro, yo miro y digo creo que si alcanza para ir ma?ana al trabajo (es una ruta de 23k y pusimos el aire acondic porq llovia mucho, entonces se gasta más), al final cuando salimos hoy me dice:  no va a alcanzar.. al rato le digo que mejor pasemos a una gasolinera y resolvamos, PERO..... se enoja entonces y me dice que si llena tarde al trabajo es mi culpa porque ayer no le echamos el combustible porque ayer no me dió la gana y ahora si  AHHH....!!!! y empieza la discusión...   Estúpides me parecieron sus argumentos (tarde maximo 2 min que es lo q duramos echando el combustible), se bajó del carro, tuve que manejar yo. UFFF de verdad que cansa y no es que nos llevemos mal, no tenemos dificultades grandes, es solo que algunas veces se disgusta o hace un tormenta por algo peque?o y me dá coraje verlo ahogado en un vaso de agua...  normalmente trato de ignorarlo para no discutir más si su disgusto es ajeno a mí.   Yo en mi trabajo tengo muchas responsabilidades, soy jefa de mi departamento, talvez por eso he aprendido a controlar mis emociones en momentos tensos.  Pero mujeres, no les pasa que a veces sentimos que somos el lado fuerte del hogar, la que lleva las finanzas, toma las decisiones y controla los momentos tensos.... y a eso sumarle que tenemos que aguantar tonterías de nuestros maridos!!  Sé que hoy como cuando pasa va a llegar, se va a disculpar, va a decir que si... me descontrolé, se que no era para tanto, etc.   Solo queiero escuchar sus comentarios, sus maridos se comportan así o es solo el mio?

20081020101137AAJwe5G	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think I am selfish?	Hello i recently graduated high school in june of last year, and my father wanted to move down to florida from new york. Me and my mother didn't want to go down to florida but my father insisted because he didn't like new york no more. I am the only child and i ended having to go. I started college down here, but i am not happy, I miss all of my family and friends that I had in New york. I told my father and pretty muched begged to go back to new york to go to college. Now i know im over 18 and I can live by myself, but my parents don't want that. There overprotective if I tell them I'll go dorm there like nope they don't want me to live by myself. So I begged them to go back and my mother doesn't like florida either. So my father finally agreed to go back. So know im here in new york with my mother going to college and my mother is working, but My father is still in florida because he can't leave his job yet and he has to try to rent or sell the house we lived in down there. Now I feel horrible because me and my mom are living over here and my father is living by himself down there and he won't be able to leave until the house gets sold or rented. I feel horrible that i did this to him, and the guilt is to much, what do you guys think?
20081020102932AA4qWQq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I say something?	My ex and I are still friends. We hang out a few nights a week, watch movies or eat dinner together. We have fun together. Were not together just friends. He has this girl that he use to be with. Her name is anonymous. He recently just broke it off with her few months ago. I know of her and she knows of me. But him and I are just friends and nothing more. So  i really could care less what he does with his females. I know this might sound sleezy but I know his voicemail password. When I called she was on the voicemail crying her eyes out. Saying i dont know why you do this to me......why.......i cant believe this....we were suppose to hang out! But she was real upset. I mean I feel bad for her. Should I ask him about her or should I leave it alone? I as a woman wouldnt want to be in that situation what should I do? Should I say something?

I have been dating, my boyfriend, Will for about a year in a half, but lately to be perfectly honest im getting bored with him. I went to talk to my English teacher who is surprisingly close to my age, only 6 years older and we have become really close. We ended up discussing Will and he asked me why im still dating him. Then he told me he was very sure someone else liked me. I asked how he knew and before i finished my sentence, he kissed me. our relationship has grown a little bit but not much. Im worried that Will is going to find out, or someone from school is going to find out and get my teacher fired. what should i do?

20081111102327AAozkBa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he interested in me? Full points!?	I am a freshman in highschool[15 years old; going on 16 really soon] There is this senior who's 17, and we are both in marching band. I do have a history of liking him and stuff, and him asking to talk in private because we had stuff in common, but that never worked out because after that he never texted me back. At a band competition 3 days before, he also was looking at me, and talking to me, but I didn't show much interest. Recently last night, he kept looking at every time i turned around he was staring at me... and he would give me quick looks. I wasn't in a, "your retarded" way. Then all of a sudden, he trips over "apparently" my bag, and just lays there. My friend and I kinda laugh quietly because it was really funny. So my friend helps him up, and I say "Good job! You pulled a kelly." He's like "yeah..." Then gets up. The next water break, he says "Kelly, can i have some of your water?" I say "Sure... but my jug-" He's already got water all over his shirt cuz my jug was broken, and i continue "is broken, hahaha." After that the rest of the rehersal he just kept looking at me. What should I do about him? Is he interested in me, or a creeper?       *Full points for BEST answer! :)*

Ive raised the issue of travelling but she wasnt interested a she travelled the world 7 years ago and loved it but has a mortgage on a hosue now so has responsibilities. I could be made redundant in August this year so it would be a great time to go, we dont live together, I live with my folks after 7 years of living with friends, so I have money saved up.       I want to go away for about 12 months but think if I do, me and my girlfriens will finish, no doubt about that, she wont wait for me for a year! No way!! I'm not sure what to do, some of my friends say I should forget abot the girl and go travelling as if I dont I will regret it in later life? Others say stic with the girl. Im very confused, Im not 100% happy with my girlfriend, we fall out far too often (once a week/fortnight so we are not talking for about 2/3 days!) its crazy!      help pls!!

20090305074739AAWDuoZ	Family & Relationships;Family	How to stop overly nosy mom snooping through adult daughter's things?	(DISCLAIMER: If you don't want to read a long question, BACK OUT NOW!)      Now, first things first, I DONT live under my parent's roof any more. I'm 20 and I live on my own (with roommates) and no financial support from my parents, so no part of what I have belongs to them anymore.       I only get to see my parents 3-4 times a year because we live a little far away and they're in a pretty rural are with no transportation/busses/trains (and I don't have a car) so the only time I can really see them is if  they come to visit.       Whenever my mom comes to visit, she takes every opportunity to snoop through whatever she can. I literally can't take my eyes off her, which is difficult when she comes to visit for, say, an afternoon. It's actually pretty violating, and it's not just my stuff, but my roommates too.       We used to share a house with my landlord; a 4 level backsplit, so me and my roommate had the top 2 floors and my landlord had the bottom 2 floors with a door inbetween. They would both be considered "private apartments".      I went up to the washroom one day, and came down to find my mom gone. After looking around for a few minutes and calling her name, I realized the door to my landlord's apartment was cracked a little. I opened the door to find her looking through a drawer in my landlord's living room reading receipts.. I accused her of it, since it's basically breaking and entering, and she said it was OK because the door wasn't locked.    Later the same day, someone came to the front door, I again left my mom unwatched for a minute.... I turn around and she's gone... I went upstairs and she says "I see your roommate's locked their bedroom door"...I confront her and her response is "i just wanted to look... " and starts crying      And this has happened many times. She'll excuse herself to go to the bathroom and i'll her somewhere going through a closet or shuffling through our paperwork.      She tries to hide that she snoops, and when I accuse her she just replies that there is nothing wrong with it, if it's not locked up it's ok to look at, even if it's in someone elses room or apartment, even though it's clearly (in some cases) illegal). She'll even go through my purse and wallet if I don't hide it or keep it in my hand. When I confront her she usually starts crying.       I've even caught her going through my roommate's wallet that was left out on a table.      Now we've moved, and I live with 3 roommates instead of just 1. It's a rented house so we can't change anything like adding locks. 2 of my roommates don't even have locks on their doors, so I know my mom will make some excuse like needing to use the bathroom so she can go and snoop through their stuff.       I always had respect for my parents and didn't even buy anything I wouldn't want them to see until I moved out, so there ARE things I want to hide from my mom...       How can I still have my mom over and stop her from snooping through other people's things? I've already tried confronting her, and I can't really stop her from coming to my house..... Any ideas?

20090305065336AA2xBYo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Anyone going through a divorce? My hubby detached,  didn't include me in anything .. cheated...?	I started finding things and all the while wondering what Icould be doing to make him find interst in me.  I am a loving,  honest, faithful, caring ( I took care of his mother & I am representative payee for his brother & take them shopping) and I am not a bad looking woman either.  He knows everything about me and I hide nothing from him and share conversations with the kids and family. He doesn't and hadn't for soo long.  It is hard realizing I knoew he had secret because I would say after he got done ont he cell phone---"was that your girlfriend, I saw you laughing, I don't think you would laugh like that with your boss"  no it was jim from work.  I feel like even though he apparently has been pulling the wool over my eyes for a while I know he loves me but obvisously he dislike things about me that he didn't share with me so I could change.  Instead he looked elsewhere and confided in someone else.  Doesn't he see we have a family.  I filed because he never wanted to work things out and I hoped that if he saw I was serious and filed he would see I can'tt live like this anymore.  I had talked to him about counseling, and telling him that this is not what ZI want but he said"We have been merely roommates for 3 years" "if it wasn't right then what makes you think that it will be right now?"       I told him after we separated that I miss him but understand we need space since he would not tell me who it is and how long it has gone on."I'm not entertaining that with an answer" "There are alot of things I will miss and few that I won't "  I guess his actions and answers are leading me to believe that he wanted a divorce just didn't have the nerve to do it.  He doesn't want to go to counseling, be honest or see 12 years is a long investment.  He is protecting this other woman, if he loved me he would break it off with her and tell me who it is.

20090305071227AAyt6nE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really want to make the right choice…please HELPPPP me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!…	I have known this guy ever since I was 17 years old, Im now 21 years old and we have a lot in common. we are both twins, the same nationally and close in age and he lives in the next street and we know each others family. I have always had something for him and I think that he had something for me by the way he acts around me. he would always come into my work and always try to talk to me. However, every time I try or he tries to make a move something happens or someone gets involved. For example, my older sister told him to stay away from me because she is “overprotective” in everything that I do. I tried to make it up to him by inviting him to my birthday and he said he would come but he never did. I asked why he did not come and if he was upset from, me but he said that he had work and could not make it. but I think that he got cold feet. Therefore, we kept being friends then I went overseas for holidays for three moths. and I joined “face book. and I added him and we began to come close to each other. he would always ask me when I would be back home and we even agreed to meet up when I returned home but tow weeks before I come home I find out he has a girlfriend and he started to act weird. Therefore, I disconnected him from face book because I was upset. and when my twin sister was at the shops he said hello to her I think he thought it was me and he was really happy even though I disconnected him and now I think that I should make peace by added him back because I still have feelings for him I don’t know what to do please help what should I do?

20090305075759AAOYUF5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i get him to trust me?	I've been dating this guy for 2 weeks now and im so scared i might lose him. Before we started dating he just broke up with his girlfriend 2 weeks before. I honestly have fallin for him so hard. He's the perfect boyfriend any girl would want. He looks so good and treats me like a angel. But there is something wrong in that. He has trust issues because of his last relationship. So he dont want to move fast in our relationship because he doesnt want to be hurt again. I feel like he is holdin back. I  dont want him to feel like he cant trust me because i wouldnt do anything to him. i think a relationship should come first in everything or it will fall apart. But he thinks im just saying that to get him to cool off about everything. What do i need to do or say to get him to see im not going to be like his last girlfriend? i need help because he might just leave me because he his afraid to get hurt again.!!!!

20090305071641AAfr2Ss	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I get through to these people?	To make a long story short: my father's family (parents are devorced) has treated me like crap my entire life. (I'm 23) I have moved on from them. My father only wants a relationship with me if I look past all the harrassing e-mails, pain, and heart ache he's caused me over the last few years. I know they are family, but like my grandmother said, I am only seen as the child who was born out of "wedlock" and I am the "gap" in the family. So, as you can imagine I want nothing to do with them. There is no talking to them about anything! Yet on Facebook, Myspace, and through e-mail they keep trying to contact me. How can I get rid of them? How can I tell them that I no longer want contact with them and to leave me alone!?

20090305080324AAVl89p	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Where do I write "and Guest" in the invitation?	Hi!  We're getting ready to prepare our invitations, and I am wondering how to address the ones that are to "So-and-So plus guest."  If the person is single and doesn't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, do I write their name on the outer envelope and add "Plus Guest" right there?  I'm hearing a lot of talk about inner and outter envelopes.  The invitations that I have do not have this mysterious inner envelope.  If it has something to do with the reply cards, we have post-cards instead of a regular card with small envelope.  So aside from that outer envelope, there really isn't anywhere else I will be writing the person's name.  Am I missing something here??  Thanks!

20090305064917AA5okU7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys 18 or over, I'm married, he's single - are the rules different for our friendship?	I met a man from UK 6 months ago while on vacation here in the US. I am married and he is single. We developed a friendship and emailed a couple times a month. I gave him my cell number and he started to text me and then called me around christmas. Since then we have started calling one another. We call or text 1x every week or two. ( he stopped emailing as I think calling is easier for him to call - he initiated the texting and calling, I was happy w/email) We were taking turns contacting each other.      About a month ago he called me and we spoke for a long time. I called him 2 weeks later (after sending him a funny email and a funny text to which he didn't respond but there wasn't a need). I called that evening and instead of waiting for him to call back, I called him 2 more times the next day looking for his address to mail him a photo of me as he asked me to. He called me back that night and we spoke for 1 hour. A week and half later I sent a photo of myself (he asked) and he texted me "got your photo and card today! will speak soon" . Then I called him 2 days later (perhaps I should have waited until he had time to chat) to joke about the other funny item I put in the card I sent him and we spoke for 15 minutes as he was going into a meeting. He seemed surprised to hear from me and a little cocky but warmed up.  He asked if he could call me back in 2-3 days. That was 2 weeks ago. He works alot and was away this past weekend. Also, we really don't communicate with one another more than 1x every couple of weeks anyway. But I got the strange feeling that I may have overstepped some boundry.      Could it be that he likes me more than friend or does he think I am pursuing him?  Or just calling when he gets the time since it is long distance? Are the rules different in guy/girl friendships. This is a new friendship and we don't really know eachother very well so any insight you can add is appreciated.      My husband knows we are friends and " couldn't care less why/why not the brit calls"      By the way we are both 40.
20090305073658AAvcFzv	Family & Relationships;Family	Friends or Family? Who would you choose?	(Long, but i really need advice)      Last year 2007-2008 i went against the wishes of my family and moved in with my ex boyfriend. I disappointed and hurt them alot, but when my ex became abusive and i could no longer live in the same apartment with him, my dad stepped in after disowning me and paid the rest of my leftover rent for the apartment, the deposit on a new apartment, and since money has been tight due to some financial issues im still paying off b/c of my ex, my dad has been slipping money into my account all year 2008-2009      My friends and i made plans to go on a cruise for springbreak and i put the $300 deposit down. Well, when i ran the idea by my dad i think he was alittle hurt and betrayed that he has been giving me money only to find out i had money to spend on a cruise.  I think he wants me to not go and do the responsible thing, which is to not miss work and maybe come home for a time during break.      I feel like this is a choice that will once again show who i am placing first in my life. My family or my friends. The only other thing that is hard is i invited a friend from school to go that doesn't know any of the other girls going, but was thinking that if i cancel i would just tell her to invite a friend. I've already paid for the ticket and if i don't use it, its $300 down the drain. What do you guys think is the right choice to make?

20090305070558AApnUsb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My first Fight with a boyfriend (answer quickly, I am about to cry)?	I am 12 and I had a fight with my 13 years old boyfriend (yea, kinda early) just because I don't want to go out with him behind my parents back...I really love him but when we were fighting I understood all the bad things in him...he flirts with other girls too but he keeps denying it. He says he really likes me and that he doesn't joke with other people's feelings and I find him sinceer.   If he wants me to go out with him behind my parents back, I just said "no" and when then he said: "Fine, you're not the only girl in the world" and I said: "Ok, go and have fun and when you have time, remind a little about me, ok?" and I signed out and he had left an offline message that said "I won't have time"    The worst is that he will be there with some of my sworn enemies, with the ones I have to act like friends, (my strategy, long story) and I am so scared he will flirt with them and other girls and that will be so not cool. If you give me "dump him" advices, please consider that I love him very very very much, in a way I never loved a guy before
20090305074021AAXWSuL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Based on getting married to have a baby, will this marriage work?	am looking for honest advice. This is such a sad story, and I am trying to move on, even though I am struggling so much.   My exgirlfriend and I were together for 3 1-2 years total. We were in love, things were great. I just wanted to wait to get married, but we were doing good, and I did stall in marry her, I KNOW this. I gave her false promises, kept telling her we would marry, then I didnt do it. I wish I could change the past and marry her, but I sadly cant. I didnt want to be with another woman, I just wanted to wait, got scared, etc.    She got a little sick and had some sort of uterus problem and the doctor told her she should be fine, but that in the future there could be complications with kids. My ex freaked out, and internalized this as "I cant have kids, i have to get pregnant now." She asked me if I wanted to have a baby, she got really desperate and I told her that medically she would be fine and that we would wait. Well, she dumped me and 5 months later married another guy and she told me, my mom, dad, family that she ONLY married him bcs she didnt want to risk NOT marrying and NOT having a baby. This happened one year ago.       The first 7 months of her marriage she called me constantly to tell me she was confused, loved me, probably made a mistake, and wished she was married to me instead, but that her husband treats her really well. She says that she got married for the baby (she is still not pregnant) but that she must honor her commitment, even though it is not want she really wanted. We have not spoken in 5 months.      If this is how she got married and feels, will this marriage work?? Will she eventually be happy? I just need to know. I need to move on, but I need to know, please give me your heartfelt answers.

I am really really torn right now. My husband recieved a text from a woman this morning saying "We just cant do this anymore, Im sorry, but last night my conscience just got the best of me"    I got her number out of his phone book and called her because I wanted to know what went on. She said that they have never met up and have just been texting. She didnt tell me what they text about but she did say she could see it going further than friendship. But then she told me he loves me a lot. I hate to say it but I dont believe it because why would he be talking to her so much and trying to "hit" on her if he did?

Ex said it happened only 1x and was a hugh mistake...oh well!   She also babysat our son...   Where are the morales of some people???   Is he stupid or what..   Would you stay friends with someone like this??

20090305080845AAbVGRK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	10 points! and over 21 please!! mature advice is appreciated :)?	My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.   We hvant talked since Valentines day and its hard because we talked everyday for a 2 years.But that was his choice. I alwtas told him no pressure if he doenst have the time to text or call but for 2 years he always texted me "goodnight love".. I know he still loves me and still cares. The last 2 times i saw him he couldnt let go of me and couldnt stop telling me that yet didnt want to talk about why he wants this.         ok, so its been a month and he saw my a university the other day and i waved to him...he came up to me and hugged me for the longest time and kissed my forehead. I was confused!! he sent me a msg later that night saying ti was good to see me and that he enjoyed the hug he also said that if we had started dating when we were 24/25 i would have been the one. & that right now he needs to figure himself out first.      i replied and i agreed with him that he needs to figure things out   and that 24/25 thing doesnt matter as you cannot time things like that.   I wished him luck in his studies and everything      do you think i handled it well?!?!?!      by the way, I knwo what alot of youmay be thinking. oh he wnats to party it up and see what else is out there. We cleared that up. I jokingly asked if there was someone else when we were breaking up and he said that he cant even thinkof something like that & that if i were with someone else it would hurt him beyond belief. & he partied sooo much before i met him when he was 18 and 19(legal age in Cda). He absolutely hates the clubs now too. Thinks hes passed that stage.He is stressed with alot of other stuff right now though.
20090305070435AAVsM0G	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I doing well avoiding him?	There is a friend of mine that is a communist. It was all good in the knot until he was open with his being communist. Now almost everyone in the knot, including me, will avoid him, mostly because he will not hesitate to start talking about how we should wake up, take action, get written in an organization etc. He has brought me the local youth communists' newspaper a couple of times and although I read it, i didn't like it. Should I continue avoiding him until we are out of high school? I find it the most effective way to get myself out of thepestering he does and it hasn't brought up any problems yet.
20090305063209AA7lSf2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does this guy like me - what are the signs?	Well, I've met him twice, and the first time he poked me to get my attention for his friend, and I turned around and his friend was like, "that was him, not me." and he just looks with a smile into space... :S      Then well I was just standing, and he just stared at me. Like no expression, his mouth open staring, his eyes normal everything. Then I was like ? in my head, and then I just walked off.      WHY WAS HE STARING @ ME??? I don't have any chest development (not that much anyway), so what was he doing?? :S
20090305065313AARtm3U	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend is a slave?	One of my best friends fell in love with a girl with him at university. Ever since they started going out with each other, he became sort of her slave. He never has time for anyone else anymore, treats his friends and parents like he didn't know them, and she is a rough and bossy girl that I don't really like, she also makes him suffer and she's very irrational and jealous as well, and he doesn't seem like he minds. Ultimately, me and my friends tried to convince him that what he's doing is wrong, he always says he'll work it out and improve, but ends up doing nothing. We know he's a bit blinded, but it's been 7 months since they've been together, and they're 22 years old, so they're grown ups... How do you think we can convince him that what he's doing is wrong?
20090305075938AAO51ir	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If he doesn't pay his child support can he still take her?	My daughter's father still lives with me. But I was wondering if I kicked him out and filed for child support, then he didn't pay can he have partial custody of her and take her? We were fighting last night and he said "go ahead file for child support i'll sit in jail before i give you a dime" He thinks that he can still have her on certain days if he leaves and doesn't pay.       When we fight it's like he gets mad at her. He won't talk to her or play with her or anything. Im worried if i kick him out he will get to take her and treat her like crap because he'll be mad at me. That's pretty much the only reason he is still here. He says such mean things when he's mad, and sometimes he throws things. I'm so scared that if he leaves he can take her. I know he is her dad and all that. I'm just worried that if he does take her he wont take care of her or he'll take his anger for me out on her.

I am positive he feels the same way, and I can see a difference in him since we got together. He has changed so much, he used to be a bit of a trouble maker and a huge clown most of the time, but now he is sweet and sincere, and he does not seem to be in as much pain. Well my problem is, my parents.. I graduate High school this year, and I am supposed  to move to California for collage. Well my parents are forbidding it because my boyfriend is going to move out there with me. He gave up everything for me so that he can help me pay for collage, but they are having a cow about it. How do I cope with this??? How do I get them to see what it really is and that we are not running away to get married or anything

20090305064659AA6Kued	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Don't know what to choose for wedding night wear?	I am not a lingerie type person, and on a regular day to day basis neither is my HTB. My MOH gave me a gift card to victorias secret so I've been looking online for something for the weddgin night. I'm not into trashy super over the type lingerie, like crotchless, boobless, ect. If I were going to wear soemthing like that I'd do it just randomly to suprise him. But at the same time I am torn between some of the more lacy see-through ones, or some of the more subtle but sexy silk/chiffon babydolls/teddies... I don't know what to pick. I want something simple/subtle/romantic/but still sexy. I'm going for when he sees me to be like wow in a sweet romantic way, not wow in a OMG my wife looks like a 10cent stripper way. I was even thinking of just a soft little cami and they have a pair of bow shorts with a big bow on the bag sort of wedding looking, but i wear that sort of thing to bed a lot...so I wanted something a bit different. Here are the 3 I'm really in between on: which one do u think will get the look I want? What type of wedding lingerie do u have?         Ok this one is sweet and romantic but it might not be exciting enough...but I do love it:  http://www2.victoriassecret.com/commerce...       This one in Ivory, it's sweet and sexy...but it doesn't look nearly as nice of fabric:    http://www2.victoriassecret.com/commerce...

20090305072846AAziaLk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I tell my friend that his wife is cheating on him?	A real close friend of mine had to go to Florida for a month to help his mom move and get settled and he left his wife here at home. She is more or less a model and he married way over his head but he really loves her. Right after he left she found me at the beach and we had a few beers. One thing lead to another and we found ourselves at my place. That night got really heated and we had sex for hours. We've continued to have sex for the last 2 weeks no less than 2 times per day. What makes matters worse is that since he had a vasectomy she isn't using any BC and now she's pregnant. He's a really close friend of mine and I feel the need to tell him that she's being unfaithful and he needs to get rid of her.

I hid my identity because I didn't anyone the know about me being gay.   It all started when I had seen a lesbian group(its the only lesbian group that exist) in my country. I decided to join the site and went about creating a fake name, "TRACY".. My society is not very accepting of gay people and I feared about what the world will think about me if they came to know I'm gay. & the main reason about me creating a fake name was because my name is very uncommon..and almost everyone knows me. So then , our lesbian group decided to meet up for lunch.. and I didnt feel good about lying to them about my name & now they all know me by "tracy".   i plan on telling them the truth but im not sure how to..   Any idea??   Please help

Run as fast as you can, you would suffer from her extreme jealousy for the rest of your life   Try to find another girl   You do not need a dog like that   Dump him   He is a control freak, leave him   She's not only a cheater but she is insensitive to you telling you anything about him   I would have left her immediately after cheating   Once a cheat, always a cheat, so don't take her back   WHY is she SOOOO stupid to stay with him?      Well, she is confessing about cheating then she may be sorry on that and just trying to be honest and you call her insensitive? Why do we become a detective and want everything in our partner faultless.  No human is just what the doctor ordered so why don’t we encourage making it up again or try understanding a bit to keep the family bond intact.
20090305064457AAg6lAB	Family & Relationships;Family	How does my sister find out if the state is going to let her adopt 2 grandchildren that they placed with?	her 5 years ago? I am involved in the case because I am adopting 2 younger siblings. I have been told that the children are staying with her because there is no other place for them. They told me they will not be adopting these older children to my sister. they have recently told her that they will adopt them to her. However, they will not tell her what she needs to be doing to get things in order for this to happen.  they will be adoptable in a few months. can she go ahead and petition for adoption now? this will force their hand and make them tell her their plans for these children. Other than see an attorney, I don't know how to advise her. there is another person wanting to adopt the children that I am looking to adopt. they have tried to talk my sister into saying that she thinks the children would be better off with the other prospective adoptive parent. she is afraid they will pull these 2 children from her home if she doesn't agree with them. they live 1200 miles away and I cannot be there to help her get some straight answers. I will be going in 3 weeks. what should she be doing to move the process along ?
20090305064740AAThaby	Family & Relationships;Family	How to work around overprotective parents?	Okay, so lets set this up. I am seventeen, I go to a really good high school and have good grades. I know exactly what I want to do with my life and I am generally the kind of person who doesn't get in trouble. I am the youngest of two girls, but my mother was raised very catholic and my father was spoiled as a child. So they both have issues and are very overprotective. I am very independent so I really don't tell my mother or father anything.       I started having sex when I was fourteen, but only a few times total over the course of two years with four different guys. It was always protected and I was on and off the pill for most of that time. My mother is completely unaware of this.       This past summer I spent a lot of time away at camps and friends' houses. My mother heard a rumor that I had been drinking at one of their houses, which I don't think she likes but she has been letting my currently 19 year old sister do it since she was 16. Its not a big deal to drink in my house. But I think she saw it as me hiding things from her and she doesn't trust me as much. I had sex with two random guys, I do know them but I wasn't dating them which is weird for me. When I came home and went back to school, I was 'talking' with a guy who is now 18. We started dating and I hid it, or rather just didn't tell my family, for about a month. She found out because I came home with a hickey one day and she hates those. He lives over an hour away but I can easily take the train/bus down to see him.       Since September, when we started dating, I have taken the train down or he has driven up to see me every weekend or every other weekend. She really didn't have a problem with me taking the train because I do it a lot anyway. Over Christmas break we both went to a camp, my parents knew he was going and they trust us, but on the first night of the camp, my mother called the guy in charge, told him we were dating, and said to watch us. I feel like my mother didn't trust me while I was there. She has since been much more protective, applying curfews she never did to my sister even when she was grounded.       I almost never get in trouble but a few weeks ago I was thirty minutes late for curfew and now I cannot go see him but he can come up to my house. I don't know why she is so overprotective. I have never done anything for her to need to worry and I just want her to let it go.       Is there some way I can convince her to let me have some space, and maybe if I make some mistake or something that she can punish me for, then she can?    I am getting really sick of her stalking me and being overprotective with me. She never does that with my sister. I would like to sometime be able to stay over my bf house, possibly from prom this spring, but I dont know how to convince her? Any ideas?
20090305064938AAed0Du	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be paranoid about xox?	My boyfriend didn't text me back last night, but it was 10.40 so he may have been asleep. I texted him today to check I was going round his later and he said yeah see you then.   But what I'm getting paranoid about is he put 'xox' at the end. We've been together 7 months and in texts we've only ever put 'xxx'.    As far as I know about guys they're not the ones to come up with these things. He must have gotten it from copying another girls kisses.   I feel like he put it by mistake, he should be at work so he would've texted quickly. Does it sound like he'd have another girlfriend and texted me the ending he would text her?
20090305065004AArJ2Op	Family & Relationships;Family	Parental Kidnapping Florida?	Our sons baby boy who is 2 1/2 years old was just taken by his mother. We have a Paternity Judgment preventing removal of the child without consent or a court order stating that she could take him. I and my husband has had temperory custody of him for the last two yeras that she willing signed over. Now after two yeras she has moved to KY married a man and has taken the baby under false pretenses that she was only going to visit him in Tampa for the week with her mother. NO written notice, no permission just verbal between I and her. She only phoned once a month to speak to this baby, last time he even physically saw her was in Sept. 2008 when she signed over gaurdianship for another year. Now we are fighting the courts that donot seem as though they care that this girl was not involved in this babys life for two years and all of a sudden because she cannot get anymore money out of me and my husband can take this baby with a final court judgement dening such.       There is so much more to this that places the baby in harms way. She has no family except this man and his parents, she just married him in OCT. 2008, no job lives with his parents and did not give a darn about this baby until now.       She and her husband both have outstanding warrents out for their arrests in Florida, this has been reported to law enforcement and so has the illeagal removal of the child. My son and us are devistated that the justice system is failing us. We never keep the baby from her or her family that lives in Florida.       How can she get away with this?       We have already filed an Emergency picup order, but was denied due to her stating it is just a vacation, but it is not, it was pre-meditated parental kidnapping.       Please any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.

20090305065652AAwZY9v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Opinion? On my story?	So I’m 26 weeks preggo and single again. I never thought that I would have to do the single mom thing again. I thought that I would get smarter with age or at least better with guys. I guess I was wrong on both accounts. So let’s start with a little back ground info. I am 24 I have a 4 year old daughter, I’m going to have a son in June. I am I nurse at walker Baptist. With Kaitlin I was young and ignorant when I had her the father  had been on drugs and off again for as long as I can remember and he wasn’t ready to change that for me and a child. I wanted to finish going to school and I knew I never would if I was with him so I left him. That was when Kaitlin was about a year old. I went to school graduated and started working as a nurse at walker Baptist, I started dating Hershel, and he had two boys. I thought we were perfect for one another. He made me so happy. As time went on I started to love him, we were together all the time. We got our kids together all the time. The kids didn’t always get along so well. But that was there age and I figured it would get better with some discipline and time. It was after all a new experience for all of us. But that isn’t the way things worked out. I always felt like I was on my own with the kids. Hershel didn’t really want to help with them he was always looking to blame someone or something else. He couldn’t just step in and say no son we don’t do that we don’t treat people that way. I spent all my time with him and his kids; we were with them more than we were at home. Hershel wanted to buy a house together. I wasn’t so sure about that. Me and kaitlyn were quite used to his kids, and he always blamed either me or kaitlyn for anything that went wrong. It was never his or his kids fault. And that really started to rub after awhile. I know my daughter isn’t perfect no child is, but I think I did a pretty good job raising her, sure she acts up like all kids do, and she is a bit of a tattletale, but I could live with that, she doesn’t hit, bite or intentionally hurt people. She was a good child. His two on the other hand needed some serious displace. The oldest who was 5 threatened to kill me in my sleep he would never mind me and would flaunt it in my face he was always intentionally hurting my child, he would hurt her then lie about it, kick her across the room, off the bed would yank her chair out from under her, say mean things to her all the time he was the worst behaved child, he would talk back and his dad and grandmother always blamed it on what happened when he was little.  The youngest was the exact opposite he was three but acted more like a one year old I often wondered if he was going to be slow. He didn’t act like most kids his age, always wanted to be fed, would sit down and cry every time he didn’t get his way he just always acted like a baby it was cute at first, then it really started to drive me insane. Then I found out I was pregnant I didn’t know what to think, I had been on BC. I was in total and complete shock. I told Hershel never expecting the reaction that I got. He went off like horribly, told me it was him or that baby that I had to have an abortion, it was nothing more than a mass of cell it wasn’t a real person or baby right now anyway.  I hadn’t ever accepted that I was pregnant yet and he was already telling me to have an abortion. I was so upset and confused. I didn’t want a baby right now, but I don’t believe in abortion now or ever. I think k things always happen for a reason. I knew than that there was no way I could have an abortion. If it wasn’t meant to be it wouldn’t be. So I stood firm and that just caused more problems. He wanted to break up, didn’t want anything to do with me or the baby, but we talked it out and I think he was okay with it. Not happy but resigned. I think he resent me from that moment on. The fighting between us just got worse after that, I was moody and bitchy and he wasn’t any better he just acted like he didn’t care about me anymore and it really hurt my feelings, so I would lash out. His kids were out of control, they acted worse than ever, and he would never try to discipline them. He just always blamed me and kaitlyn for very thing. If I ever said anything about one of his he would tell me kaitlyn wasn’t perfect either. I knew that, but she wasn’t mean didn’t hit people minded and didn’t talk back. She whined and tattletaled. And I would discipline her. Nobody heal overnight. It is a work in process but maybe I approached him on it wrong who knows. That was what our last fight was about. I told him that I didn’t want to move in with him until he got his kids a little more under control. He took that as I didn’t want to be with him anymore. So when I called him the next day he was really mean to me and I asked what was going on and he said that we were broke up why was I calling him. So of course I’m 17 weeks pregnant and I kind of lose control I start crying, and he was just so mean saying hateful thi

20090305065930AAANqWR	Family & Relationships;Friends	6 months of friends with benefits, what is next?	I am going to make this short and sweet...I know everyone asks this question, so I apologize...      1 year of being best friends..then we were out of each others lives for about 5 month, then we were brought back into each others lives...a few dates, then starting sleeping together. This has been 6 months now. We only briefly had a conversation around the 2 month mark, and he started to say something about how everyone thought we should be dating (which is true..everyone sees the chemistry we have), and I shooed it away because I didn't think he really wanted that thinking he just was trying to say something nice, and didn't want him to say he didn't want to date me after saying that. I then told him I wanted us to hang out more, even if we were having "just sex," so we have been for 6 months...he took me out for my birthday-dinner-very romantic...and when I went away for a vacation he came to visit me and see some other people.   I ask the question....I know I need to have a conversation with him..but is THERE ANYWAY he actually has more feeling for me than just sex?? We have amazing chemistry, still good friends, great sex..so I want to see if there is more..but I am afraid that he won't feel the same, which I will move on, but before I initiate the conversation I would like someone advice...  MOVE ON-because it will never be anything more than sex, or MOVE FORWARD-because there is a chance. I mean if it is just sex, why take me out for my birthday???       thanks for your responses...

20090305071555AAa5kP6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Really weird situation...please help?	I am living with my fiance in my parent's basement just for the moment because we recently relocated and the housing market here is crazy so we're just stopping there for a couple of months until we can get some money together.      My sister, who is 17 almost 18 also lives at home, along with my Mom and Dad. My Mom and Dad just got back from Florida (there were gone for two weeks). Last night they noticed that two of the knives from their good set of knives were missing. They looked all over the kitchen and they couldn't find them. I helped them look and then I went into my sister's room and looked under her bed and in her drawers, but I didn't go into her closet. I couldn't find them.      I told them it wasn't me (it definitely wasn't) and my Mom was being very rude, saying there was a "pyscho killer chick" living in the house. She said chick, so obviously she meant my sister or me. She says she was joking but she wouldn't stop going on about it.      When my fiance got home from work at 11 p.m. I asked him if he knew where they were and he didn't. So we went to bed. When I woke up the next morning my Mom was in the kitchen and I started to tell her that my fiance didn't know where the knives were, and then she said that they had mysteriously been put back in the night. I looked and they were put back. This led her to being even more rude by saying someone in the house is really "peculiar". Again, it wasn't me.      I phoned my Dad because I thought maybe he had found them this morning, and he hadn't. My sister I don't think was around last night when we were looking for the knives. I asked my fiance if he put them back last night and he said no. And my Mom says she has no idea how they got there.      Who do you think is lying? This is really annoying me!

20090305071031AAKnWc1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I found a picture of another girl in his bed... What do I do?	Last night I stayed at my boyfriend's house. When I pulled back the blanket on his bed, I found a picture of another girl. (If you put two and two together, I'm sure you can figure out why it was there.) It wasn't just any girl though, it was a friend of his whom I can't stand. She invites him places, but not me; she talks to him all the time, and is kind of known to be... a little off color in the relationship aspect. He told me that he didn't have anything with her, him doing that was a way to release anger and stress at me without actually doing something he would regret. I know this isn't as bad as it could be, but still it betrays my trust so much. I'm not sure what I'm even feeling right now because I'm so upset. I just think it is going to be very hard for me to be able to trust and feel the same way about him again. I do love him, and we've had our future planned out for a while now, but what will happen when he heads to college? He wants a second chance, and I know he probably does deserve one since he didn't actually cheat on me, but I think I'm going to have a very hard time with this. What would you do?      I didn't even go to school today because the thought of walking into her mom's classroom with pictures of her all over the place makes me sick. I can hardly look at him the same way as I used to. I'm just simply disgusted.

Now, we are engaged, and this ex has been dating my fiance's Best Man for about a year now.  He's totally okay with her coming to our wedding, but I can't stand the thought.

Hi. heres the deal my husbands ex wife recently found out that he got remarried and flipped her damn lid and took the child away and wont let him see her, so we filed contempt charges on her and in the midst of this she presented the court with a paternity test naming another man as the father. thats all well and good becuz my husband questioned it anyway. this other "dad" was supposed to file papers to have my husbands name removed from the birth certificate and to start taking full responsibility but as im sure you can guess that has not happened. so in the mean time, were still paying retarded amounts of money for this child and shes not even his nor does he get to see her. how is this even allowed? and child support enforcement said that even when his name is removed from the birth certificate he could possibly still have to pay for her.... what the hell is really going on?

20090305074603AAsa3Qe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend letting me call him someone else during sex?	Well I had a fight with my boyfriend about something he did. And I would tell him, teasing him saying things like oh ray j from for the lov of ray j is so hot. He knows I was just playing with him, but I do find him attractive. So when we had sex yesterday he put on sunglasses to make him look like him and he said to call him ray j.                             I didn't at first, but he kept asking so I started to. And he was telling me say you love me say you want this from me, so I did. I just think this is weird and he hates when I say things about ray j or even watch the show around him. After we finishedhe told me he just did it cause he wanted to make me happy. I just don't understand this whole situation and why he would ever let me do that.
20090305075109AAaHyR5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm seeking attention for the wrong reasons.  Why?	There is this man that I have been dating off and on for the past few years.  In the beginning we really hit it off, but as time went on there were issues that I wasn't really happy about.  After that, things were not so hot and heavy.  We drifted apart, which he was not happy about, but I couldn't see it any other ways.  However, now I can't stop thinking about him, can only remember all the good times, and want to start things up again.  BUT, I know those issues still are alive and things will just go back to being bad again.  Now I am totally sending him mixed signals, and I don't now why I am doing it.  He would take me back in a heartbeat, but I really don't want to go back, why am I doing this?

20090305075830AA2R8Hj	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I deal with my in-laws when my husband refuses to do anything?	I have been married for 2 years to my husband who happens to be a momma's boy. My sister in law seems to be the main problem for me. My husband and I thought maybe we were pregnant a few months after we got married and when she found out, she told me i better hope i wasn't because there would be a search for my dead body if that were the case (she is having infertial issues) when this obv. pissed me off when she said this to my face and infront of other family members i pulled my husband aside because i wanted to beat her @$$ for saying this to me, however my husband tells me to just let it go and not to say anything about it because a conflict would upsit his mother. A few summers ago, we went camping with his family and were there for only 5 mins before his father made a comment about his nice new chair that was made for heavier set people and it would be my chair for the remainder of the camping trip ( he then tried to cover it up by saying he was being nice by offering me his new chair) however being a woman i found it rather a rude comment. So anyways my point is, how do i deal with my in laws, Ive separated myself as best as i could but now my hubby is getting upset that i avoid his family, what would you do?

20090305083802AAUuqbl	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend not wanting to hang out with guy friends after he gets a girlfriend?	My boyfriend and his friends have this guy friend who always used to come to hang outs and stuff. 8 months ago he got a girlfriend (his first girlfriend) and since then he has changed. He almost acts like he doesn't want to be around the group of guys.    On another note, his girlfriend hates his friends and even sent a message to one of his friends(my boyfriend) saying she would basically do anything to destroy his relationships he has with his friends and even his girlfriend.    We think that the girlfriend hes been with for eight months is brainwashing him into hating the group of guys he hangs out with.    If this is the case, what do we do about this? His girlfriend claims she is not brainwashing him but there is a big difference.    The girlfriend threatens suicide a lot, and gets very upset when her boyfriend wants to be with his guy friends.       What do we do about this? I know it is a bit confusing but the group of guys are desperate to get their old friend back. The only thing that would work is breaking them apart but we don't want to do that.       How do we get our old friend back???

20090305082848AA6UROY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you could change 1 thing about your spouse, what would it be and why?	This question is pretty self explanatory. :)      Thanks!
20090305083756AAASDoZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If your spouse could change 1 thing about you, what do you think they'd change and why?	My last question has inspired me to ask this one, LOL.      What do you think your spouse would change about YOU?               Me:  I think it depended how loving my husband was feeling at the moment. He'd either say -- "I wish she weren't disabled anymore so she didn't have to feel pain all the time" or "I wish she were less sensitive because it's annoying." LOL
20090305083731AAPeJ2f	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it ok to take a break from your spouse for a month?	We have a 7 mth old together so he can see our child whenever he wants. I just need a break. I think it would be good for me. He always takes a stab at my side of the family b/c he doesn't like them. He doesn't like them due to some fight a long time ago. so, he pretty much tries to keep me away from them. I can't drive or I'd go see them on my own. That's part of the reason, I want to take a break from here. (to work on driving). Anyways, anything I'm passionate about, he doesn't care and so it brings me down knowing I can't get support from him. If I try to build this house up by trying to make it look like something, he tares it all down by drowning our home w/ computer junk. I'm exhausted and know I can do better. All my efforts go out the window. I never get to pamper myself but he cuts his hair when he wants or buys something for himself. He'll only take me to my grandparents depending on which grandparents they are. They're all in bad health and I wanna see them before it's too late. He also goes a horrible amount of time without bathing. I'm tired of talking to him about it b/c he makes excuses. His excuse this time is "I wanna be home with you and the baby and don't have time to shower". I make time so why can't he? He's not respectful towards the things I bought way before I even met him. Yet, if it was from his family, he'd value it. I just need a break. A break to get re-organized, work on driving (I have someone in mind who will help with that) and just plain out relax.

20090305082735AAvL62w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need your help!! Do I move on from thinking about this guy or wait and see?	I am just friends with this guy and I do not want to be physical until I feel more security in the situation, but we have been physical in the past. We are very connected, similar and attracted to each other and laugh together A LOT. I can tell he cares. Sometimes when he texts me, he won't ask me to hang out but he waits for me to ask. What do you think? I don't call him at all...      He always wants me to sit close to him, he is always complimenting me, he likes to talk about how cute my nose is in front of his friends, he always brushes the hair out of my face, even when we're in groups of people, his friends hint to me that he loves me, that they think we will work out, etc.    He has called himself a "loser" and seemed uncomfortable with who he is at times. He doesn't have a job but he is in business school.      Sometimes it seems like after doing the sweet things, he puts a wall back up and plays it cool in front of me for some reason and I don't hear from him again for a week. So, I don't want to play guessing games. What should I do? I get so many different opinions....Should I not be focusing on all the signals and wait for it to be clear? I dont' want to push the issue...
20090305083343AAqrEjQ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Advice? Opinions? suggestions? Anything at all..............?	Hi..    I've been with my man just over 3 years...   From the beginning we''ve had our issues!      He's a compulsive liar.. right from the beginning he told me lies like he could drive, he was in the army, he had been to America...etc. All stupid lies he did not need to tell.      So I found out, and forgave him cos I felt sorry for him. It went well after that, he never lied.. and in this time, we fell totally in love and by the time we were together 6 months, he had proposed, and I accepted!      I then had alot of stress with my job, and my health which put alot of strain on our relationship. To put it bluntly, I wasn't the best person to be around. I was groughy and really down. But he was there.      Then suddenly, when we were a year together....we had an argument and it came out that he had feelings for a girl he worked with. I was insanely jealous... but most of all... that day - was the day my heart broke! He was distant all over that Christmas period. Left me alone and crying on New Years Eve. (Even though I had a big party planned, I had to cancel as we had another argument abuot this girl, he packed his stuff and left, only for me to find out he spent the night partying at hers!)      Anyway, we got through it, but a month later I found out, while he was after that girl at his work he had texted another girl wanting to meet up for sex, and texted another girl claiming to love her.      But again, I forgave him and we got through it.      At Christmas just there, I found out that he had claimed to another girl (at his new job) that he liked her too!      When I approached him each time, about all these girls, he says he loves me, and doesn't know why he does it. He says he depressed and trying to feel something.. etc..      Anyway, just when I thought we had got over all of those other girls   (none of them whom he's actually physically cheated on me with, just told them he likes them..etc)      I was on his laptop last night.. and I came across a chatlog... of him talking to another girl who he met online on the PS3. He had been on msn chatting to her... and it sounded like really deep. They were telling each other that they loved each other, and oh how they missed one another...      I just don't what to do. He was sitting in the room with me when I found, I asked who she was, I cried, I shouted, I talked to him. He sat with head down answering to every question with "I don't know" & "I can't remember"      He said he didn't mean it, and that he didn't know why... yada yada heard it all before.      I'm numb. I can't cry anymore. But I still love him.   I don't want to be without him... and there's also a weird part of me that is scared if I do split with him, he'll go away and find someone else and be happy.. and I'll be left on my own.. with nobody interested, cos I've put alot of weight on in the last two years.       I know those are selfish thoughts..       anyone been through the same? I wouldn't usually come on here with this... but I can't tell anybody. All of my friends will just say "AGAIN?"      Help. Any advice, stories..etc much welcome!!!!! Thanks xxxxxxx

We got along great, watched movies, went to the mall, all those friend's stuff. Then, she moved to Canada two summers ago due to her father getting a new job. She met new friends down there of course, and she completely changed. Now, she smokes pot, very stubbourn and doesn't even care how I feel.       At the moment, we only talk on the internet because she stopped calling me. About 2 weeks ago, I was very sick, busy with school and just had no time to get on the computer. She was completely pissed at me for not being on. She thought that I did not want to talk to her or my other friends that I chat with on the internet. She called me betch (she pronounced it the real way) and said I was selfish. I apologized to her, told her that I couldn't help it, I told her everything I needed to tell her. She kept saying, "Lmao, lol" all that crap. Should I be friends with her if she won't forigve me for something that I can't handle?

20090305082123AAygrWV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	MY girlfriend got kissed by anothe dude...what do i do?	She was up at a hockey tourney with some people. Everyone was drunk but her and she went to go to bed. She woke back up at like 6 am and some dude she knew just came and layed down beside her and turn around and kissed her on the side of the mouth. She was half asleep soshe just turned over the other way and mumbled something like "no". She let it fly cuz he was drunk. But loater that day me and her got in a big fight over the phone and considered a break. She started to cry her eyes out and began shaking anad heaving cuz we do love each other. We lost our virginity to each other. She was in the bathroom crying and the dude was leaving and came in and held her while she explained how much she wanted to be with me and how she lost her VIRGINITY to me and said we might be on a break. It calmed her down a little to think of me. But while she was thinking the dude propped her head up and said "everything is gonna be allright" and kissed her for like 2-3 seconds and tried to put his tongue in her mouth. She said she puckered by complete reaction and didnt know what was happening. and when she realized what was she put her hands out and backed away from him. She said she didn't expect him to do that and said she was completely innocent and taken advantage of. She then remembered what the dude did when he was drunk and realized what he was trying to do all along. After he left, she texted him right away saying "that was a mistake and i never wanna do that again." Now she doesnt trust other boys at all and wont even hug them. Did she cheat? Can be so sad make you oblivious to whats happening? I do love her more then anything and she loves me the same. I just cant take a back a cheater. I would kick his @$$ but he lives like 3 hours away and have know idea where he lives and hes is the kind of kid who apparently would file assault charges..(cool huh).Is her story legit. (BTW i know so many details because i asked a hundred times so i could determine what exactly happen not cuz of her saying all of this.) please help. I think she is innocent!
20090305081229AACLyR8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is wrong with Wisconsin women?	I've heard people from out of state say that this is the most unfriendly place they've ever been. I too have noticed that it is unfriendly here to a fairly large degree and I've lived here my whole life.. It's very hard to approach people you don't know and if you do, prepare to get shot down viciously. It's also been more difficult to meet women here for dating than I've experienced when I've been out of state. No there is nothing wrong with my approach, it works for me just about anywhere else and I've gotten numerous friends, and dates. But it just seems like you can't talk to someone here that you don't know, whether it's waiting in line at the store, at a ballgame, or a bar. People seem to have the mentality here that if they don't know you, they don't want to waste 5 seconds interacting with you unless it's flipping you off.       I don't know what is going on but I have extreme difficulty in meeting women here and I haven't experienced the same difficulties anywhere else in the country as far as dating goes. I tried online dating and I can't even get replies from the girls in this state that I contact unless it's a snide, nasty comment. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong because I'm getting boatloads of emails and such from girls out of state (even in Illinois, Minnesota, and Iowa) who are very interested in me and want to go on dates with me, but it's sorta far for me to do that and I don't have the money to travel like that to see someone.      Does anybody have any pointers or know anywhere that I can move where the people are more friendly and the dating scene is nicer?

20090305082248AA94mSv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How does "back" child support work?	Can a woman say that a particular man is the father when, say, the child is 10 or 15, and say she wants child support for all the years of the child's life that the father was unaware he had a child?      My situation is, a girl I was with once or twice said she just had my child. The timing is off from when she gave birth and when we were together, and on top of it, the child looks absolutely nothing like me. She says she wants money but will not allow me or my fiancee to have any visitation. Now, I know I am entitled to visitation if I'm paying support, so if it is my child I want visitation.      I know I can force her, via court, to take a paternity test to know for sure. But, my fear is that if I don't, she will  wait until the child is much older (like 15 or 16) to demand "back" child support and say I need to pay for all those years when the child was younger. That way, she can still get all the money but obviously I would have missed out on years of visitation.       Can a woman wait years and years and then all of a sudden file and collect for those past years or does child support start from the time the woman files for it?
20090305082710AAUfaqQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can i still do something about my ex husbands military adultery if were already divorced?	ok, so we were married and he had an affair in iraq with another woman and got her pregnant. I of course found out the second they got back in the states, but he of course denied it up until after the divorce was finalized 4 months later. So the entire 4 months as he was calling me and settling things for our divorce and our daughter, i was calling and emailing his chain of command and his commander about the issue and all i got was, "i need solid evidence". like as if the baby in her womb wasnt enough. so the baby was born october 3, and our divorce was finalized october 14. i dont understand how in the world he got away with that. he finally admitted in november. his term in the army was up in january and now hes paid 3 months of child support, seen his firstborn once for 20 minutes since she turned 1 and she is now 3. and he also has been texting me telling me he wants to give up rights. I need to do something about this jackass.
