vyHwhACjaa	If he's not going to be in a title match then I would at least hope he appears in Money In The Bank. After all it was Jericho's idea and he's never won. Y2J being Mr. Money In The Bank would be very credible, as Jericho has already proven he can win the world championship at a moments notice.|`|2kVmQWF0aa	He should face Stephanie Mcmahon at Wrestlmania I may pay to see that.|`|yfXpPXlMaa	Maybe Money in the Bank again? Maybe a match against CM Punk for the intercontinental? Big face vs. big heel. Gives 2 more people a chance at MITB as well I guess.     I know WWE like them, and it's a big draw, but I think the celebrity matches are kinda stupid.|`|3m9DQuDRaa	I believe Jericho will end up in the MitB.  I don't believe he'll win it, though, as this would be a kind of last minute change in plans.  But you never know...  that's how John Morrison won the championship.|`|l6g3moiEaa	LOL, if there wasn't gonna be a match with Rourke as Randy the Ram, brother, it was gonna suck anyway.

He has no choice but to show some bite.|`|gpNIG15eaa	That fat waiter is just jealous Alex Ferguson is the greatest manager in the whole world and wishes he was the chairman of the FA.|`|yulika3laa	He simply thought that "it was time" to show some fangs. He thought that with his team's performances then, it would add some spice to their so called journey to become English Champions. What he didn't realize is that his team were not really good enough.    I don't think he spoke out to challenge Sir Alex mentally. Even the dumbest person knows Sir Alex is one of the best in mind games.    Apart from that, he's just losing it. You know, blame others for things that are your fault.|`|4ecd94d350b85a878a8087e8d7d214d4aa	When Rafa came to Liverpool in 2005 , he was a stranger , and so he decided to adapt step by step without aggressive encounters with others .. but now he got the experience , realized very well what will be the exact other's reactions to such actions , he is no more a stranger , he became a Liver's symbol , also with some pressure , an obvious chance to win the EPL , he get mad !!!

MXwcAom4aa	No, the elbow was unintentional. It would be unsportsmanlike had he done it on purpose or if he didn't approach Gerald after the hit, which would have also led to a potential suspension or fine. He was in the motion of putting his hands up and the elbow just got in the way.    In a nutshell:  Bynum's elbow was too late when his arms were on the way up and inadvertently got in the way of Wallace. The kid's a natural shot blocker, so it may have not been on purpose. So it does not warrant a suspension in my opinion.    For an intentional hit, look here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khM5WjeyL...|`|AA11488609	No.  Sure Bynum deserved a flagrant 1, which he got, but from looking at the replays, he at least never looked like he wanted to ram Wallace to the ground.      Otherwise, Shaq should be suspended for injuring Andray Blatche a couple days ago simply because he's real strong and Blatche is a stick, and ironically, the man himself, Gerald Wallace should be suspended for stepping on Gilbert Arenas' knee, for those of you who don't know what caused Agent 0's misfortune the last couple of years.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	He elbowed him really hard. Fair is fair remember what Horford did on Ford. That was unintentional, but he was suspended. i do not know if this was unintentional or not, but it still warrants a suspension because of this Wallace has a collapsed lung and bruised rib cages.    It doesn't matter if it was unintentional or not hits, like that warrant a suspension. If it was done in the playoffs then it would be questionable and should not be suspended, but worthy of a fine. But, this is the regular season and he should be suspended no love lost.|`|AKHywxwlaa	yes|`|bda90fe4a3f3926b8f365b8127d043c2aa	he elbowed him in the ribcage...i think that's really very unsportsmanlike, even if it was unintentional|`|dOelpoecaa	it didn't look that bad or intentional.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Nope..................|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I hate it when players commit fouls like that.  Now wallace is out with maybe a broken rib.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	I think it does.  It's not his elbow that's the problem, it's his hip.  Bynum gives Wallace a hard hip check while Wallace is up in the air and extending for the basket.  That's what knocks Wallace off balance and sends him crashing the the floor.  Bynum clearly wasn't going for the ball.|`|0yljkLGeaa	all i can is **** YOU BYNUM!!!  you shouldn't have played basketball at all!

If you strike an illegal target, such as the back of the head, the spine, or the groin; if you kick, knee, or stomp the head of a downed opponent (I think Wes Simms got DQ'd against Mir that way); if you bite, gouge, or head butt them.  I've seen fighters get points taken away for grabbing the fence and for "spiking" an opponent on their head, but I can't see someone getting DQ'd for that.
eDCyle05aa	About an hour before the race I eat a bannana or a spoon full of peanut butter because it gives you an energy boost.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Don't eat within several hours of the race, eat something that is not going to upset  your stomach.  Don't eat meat or dairy products.  You are not going to get any extra energy from your meal, but what you eat may upset your stomach during the race.  These events are not endurance events, they do not last more than a few minutes.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	In high school I was always partial to half a Snickers bar about an hour before the race.

With things the way they are now, they'd make a lot more money at Rockingham than they do at California and look at the fuel alone they'd save on just the drive alone.

LA is simply not a sports town. generally speaking the people there just simply lack passion for sports. but NASCAR, the NFL, and every other sports leauge will continue to try to force their products on LA LA land because it makes good financial sense, so get used to it.     rockingham, on the other hand, is an old speedway with poor facilities. the attendance of the races  there was also very poor the last 4 or 5 years they held cup races. a big part of the reason for this was because they were given crappy dates by NASCAR. the 2 rockingham races were held in feb. and nov. the last 5 or 6 years. i would loved to have seen what would have happened if, after taking 1 race away from there, they had moved the other 1 to a warmer date, i'll bet it would have made a big difference in attendance. it was sad to see it close though, i used to love to go there for races and camp. the locals there were always so nice, and they always got excited on race weekends with all the race fans coming to their tiny town. kinda like martinsville.|`|KxCtFhV7aa	California isn't usualy that exciting of a race, and the Rock was    Have a great day M.

Nascar Nation is the best!!!!!!|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I think the exclusion of the rock is a travesty. I have nothing against California but it just seems to me that the folks out on the left coast don't have the passion or show the support that is shown in the east and south...........    M Pepper, have a great spotlighted day!!|`|9BtA5Knfaa	They need to split the races up 1 at California and 1 at The Rock and not just get rid of the Rock!!          M Pepper, today is your day ENJOY, and have a good one!!!  Bye the way tell your cuz, Dr.Pepper I said waz UUUP!!!  HEHEHE LOL! just kiddin!!!|`|TCehI17kaa	Enjoy your day as well Nascar Nation.|`|n55igpCUaa	Okay, so leave 1 Cali race, 1 NHMS race, 1 Pocono race, and 1 MIS race. Install lights and make them night races. Replace the missing ones with Nashville, Kentucky, Laguna Seca, and The Rock.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	I live out here in Calif, and my one of my all time favorite tracks is The Rock, I use to live 10 minutes from The Rock when I was growing up. All of my little Nascar group that i'm in out here would not mind taking one from Calif and giving it to The Rock. We know once the Auto Club Sponorship of the track is over this track will be shopping mall probably, California people just do not have enough time to devote to Nascar way to much to do out here. The Feb race is always up against the Academy Awards and that is as big as the Super Bowl out here, People throw huge Oscar Parties, they could care less about Fontana. The Rock should have never lost a race, especially to Calif.  M Pepper enjoy your day, its yours do anything you like.    Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|OFFjKX72aa	If anything the Rock deserves two races and California none. California is too similar to Michigan and that makes it lose appeal to me. The Rock is a unique track whose surface made the teams think smart in order to preserve their tires and made for an interesting Sunday. California has a lot of cautions, most of them coming from the large amount of debris such as hot dog wrappers that gets blown onto the track. Bring back 'The Rock'!    -Edit-    Congrats, M Pepper.|`|zii6IWHoaa	NASCAR seems  to have lost touch with the history that got them where they are now, Rockingham, North Wilkesboro, Darlington|`|muc8sq9naa	I still like California, but I'm partial...I live there.  I would love to see them race at the Rock again but...not gonna happen.    Here's to you:  M. Pepper.  Have a really fun day.    *JAKD*|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I miss the Rock. It was always a great track. I wish they would bring it back. Since they got an ARCA race last year, maybe they can get a Nationwide race or something. I personally think that California doesn't deserve two races. The racing there can be pretty dull at times.    Congrats and have a good day, M. Pepper!|`|b74c7c820c32f05c280545197fca275faa	California's races are boring, and, apparently not drawing fans.  Rockingham, on the other hand, is legendary and would draw the fans, but does need some work before becoming re-certified for NASCAR.  If I had my way, Auto Club Speedway's races would be replaced by a race at Toyota Speedway (Irwindale) and a race that runs odd-years at Iowa and even-years at Kentucky.

AA11109752	Not by the wall, but it did hit off the goalie's hands as it crossed the line.  Sweet strike though!  He did a great job of recognizing that (1) the keeper would leave the near post wide open, and (2) that the keeper would immediately shift his body weight towards the middle of the pitch.  Of course, when Beckham hit the ball, the keeper did take a half-step to the middle, and then dove back towards the ball and got there a second too late.  Beckham should stay at Milan.    thessg.blogspot.com

FYd1ndVxaa	Two different strong styles. Federer has his way, Nadal has his own too. We will see how these different ways outdo one another, and see who prevails in the end.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|3jBUJxOdaa	yes he has a chance..but i don't think he'll win the title here against fed this year, but he'll be more ready for next year.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	The way Fed's been playing, nobody can stop him...except for Rafa, that is. I expect to see another instant classic on Sunday, with the Spaniard winning in 4...|`|ClQ9yJweaa	I love Nadal as well and is the only player, besides Murray of late, to be able to beat him consistently, on any surface. If Nadal falls to Verdasco wich possesses a very similar style to Nadal in the semis, Fed will have his day with him. Would be awesome to see Nadal against Federer once again in a Final on a diffferent surface. The slower hard court might give RaFa the edge, but will be surely another entertaining Final, no doubt. First though, he needs to beat his "twin". Verdasco has buffed up, hitting so much stronger, and looks like Nadal with his game. This could be Rogers 14th.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	i'm a federer fans and i was thinking that roger might not beat nadal.  they're both playing really well, so it'll be a good match.|`|c46a4fbd2c6a4c512dd76cd2d2cc0b44aa	Lol!!! That's just like saying does Roger stand a chance against Rafa at the French Open.     If Roger plays his best in the finals like in his game against del potro and roddick, then sadly Rafa will have no chance at all.     Im a Roger fan and this is not just being biased or anything. Del Potro is no slouch as he has consistently been winning the last year but look at what Roger did to him. 6-3, 6-0, 6-0.     Look at Roddick. Roddick is known for his killer serves which averages at 206kph. However, Roger has even more service aces than Roddick in his match against Roddick yesterday.    Roger is hell bent on tying with Sampras record of grand slams so he'll crush everything that stands in his way.|`|efk81nMRaa	I HAVE faith with Nadal and everytime FED plays with him, FED's game is totally different. Remember that FED owns Wimbledon and look what happened last year. Mentally and physically, FED is different everytime he faces NADAL. I WILL GO ALL THE WAY to NADAL and I can see him (NADAL) beating  FEDERER in the finals (if Nadal beats Verdasco which I am hoping sincerely) VAMOS RAFA. SHOW TO THE TENNIS WORLD THAT U ARE REALLY THE NUMBER 1 PLAYER NOW WITHOUT A DOUBT.    Nadal leads FED on there HEad to head meetings (12-6) as breakdown below:                          HARD           CLAY          GRASS      TOTAL    NADAL             2                   9                 1              12  FED                 3                   1                 2                6    They met 14 times in the finals and the score was 10 - 4 in Nadal's favor (though most of the finals were played in clay which is Nadal's favorite surface). But Nadal also beats FED's on both hardcourt and Grass which is FED's favorite surface.    NADAL ALL THE WAY.............|`|GombKA8Kaa	Rafa is the favourite. He hasn't lost a set yet this tournament and Roger has struggled to find form.    Rafa is No 1 in the world!!!     If Rafa wins against Fernando he will beat Roger. If Fernando beats Rafa, Roger will win the Final.

NJMzhcKhaa	Machida also the only one to beat Rich Franklin in Light Heavyweight division, and the only one other than Anderson Silva to beat Rich.    But Machida is not an exciting fighter to the average bear drinking viewers of UFC.  Until Machida can find the balance of being a good fighter and an exciting one, his career won't get anywhere. UFC is a spectacle sport, if you can't impress then it will be hard to find your place in there properly however good you are.    Admittedly not many of Lyoto's fight will be interesting enough to the average people since he's not aggressive and fight very carefully, so there you go.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	He' gets the title shot if he wins his next fight.  I already talked to Joe Silva about it,  but the guy he is fighting ain't no pussie.|`|UictPrl5aa	after he beats silva silly|`|36u3Ml0kaa	Yes he is boring to the average viewer who has no idea how or why he is fighting the way he is.  He is a very smart and strategic fighter.  I would love to see him get a title shot if he beats Thiago Silva.  He deserves it-Rampage can wait.|`|616f37abb5f6bb497fbb33bae765a7e2aa	Brock had marketability which equals $$$ for the UFC. Machida is barely know to the casual MMA fan. Machida has some good wins, but they aren't top contender wins, and most of his fights went to decision rather then finishing them. Yes, he did get a when over Tito, but lets face it, Tito is not the fighter he used to be. If Machida manages to beat Thiago Silva then he will be in title contention. But he will still have to wait a little bit because Rampage will get the next title shot unless he loses to Jardine which is highly unlikely.
Tdzk4o5Iaa	Doesn`t Matter they will still never win a Playoff Game!        GO EAGLES!!!!!!|`|a6EndAPiaa	Because there was no NFC South when the Cowboys joined the league.  In fact when the Cowboys joined the league the only other team South of the Mason-Dixon line was the Redskins.  Which is why George Preston Marshall (then owner of the Redskins) fought Dallas getting a team -- which was the start of the Cowboys Redskins rivalry.    Now because of traditional rivalries they stay in the East.      --- Edit  I should have said there was no *NFL* team South of . . .   because we are talking about NFL/NFC teams not AFC teams.|`|u7GBP579aa	gary e is right|`|2e8927a3f6a8ce1bcb8c36d3d86c7439aa	Cowboys in the NFC East   Colts in the AFC South   Rams in the NFC West   Cheifs in the AFC west     It is what it is|`|dnwJmNkdaa	geographically yes.  However they were in the NFC East since before the merger of the NFL and AFL and have long time rivalries with Philadelphia Washington and NY.  When the NFL went to the new north south east west format they moved some teams.  For INstance Arizona Cardinals were part of The NFC East and Seattle was part of the AFC west.  Dallas fan base is much larger than Arizona and Seattle and People have emotional investment into hating them.    tradition is the short answer|`|8vCzgOlpaa	Yes they should but the powers to be decided to leave it as it is|`|Bgpk4npBaa	i think they should move the cowboys to the NFC south and the carolina pathers outta the south to the east|`|HtinWEuhaa	Keeps the Giants and Eagles rivalry alive!|`|AVYaugeoaa	tradition, tradition and tradition. the nfl wants to keep the rivalry between the cowboys, giants, redskins and eagles alive.|`|uoEfoI7aaa	wow...answers are close..but not quite accurate...  The Dallas Cowboys became an NFL expansion Team in 1960 , at that time, the Dallas Texans owned by Lamar Hunt was already in Dallas and they were an AFL team.  Hunt moved the Texans to Kansas City where they became the Chiefs.  When Dallas joined the NFL there was only 2 other teams west of the Mississippi...The NFC East was created and Dallas, NYG, Philly, St. Louis Cards and Washington were all slated against each other.|`|RSBBPYDWaa	The Arizona Cardinals used to be in the NFC East.|`|3yHJFp1Kaa	For the guy with the pic of Eli......Cowboys and Redskins have a WAYY bigger rivalry than they do with the Eagles or the Giants.

Fez9gSf3aa	People are jealous, especially whites. Think about it, historically, tennis was a white game, no blacks allowed. Then you had a few blacks to win at least one major but the William sister's dominates, both have titles and has won a lot of money. The haters should be glad they do not play doubles as much because they would take that as well. Lol    For the one's saying people hate them becuz of their dad, BS! Their dad had/has every right to express himself. He's was born in what, the 40s and knows racism very well. He knows what his daughters have to face, lets not put it under the rug. And for the record, I find it hypocritical to hate the sisters even if it was becuz of their dad because Dokic dad is way worse but people do not hate Dokic.|`|1xFwfz5Raa	Well I grew up playing tennis, live in an all white community, and Serena is my favorite player ever to live.  I love watching both of them play tennis.  Yes, I also like Sharapova, but I love the Williams' sisters!|`|5HeNp5tjaa	its because there black thats the truth. look at everybody hating on obama i didnt hear nearly as much bitching wen whore bush was running this country into the ground.. serena and venus are good athletes point blank end of story if they hate then let em hate|`|0Har0q79aa	It's not about them being black. It's because earlier they were so better than the rest that they used to reach the finals and their dad decided who among the two would win...kind of match fixing, that people thought..|`|o4NicQNGaa	Its always great to see them play as they seem to be the only ones that can stop all the Russians beauties snatching all the women tennis titles and especially the Grand Slams.  Look at what happen in the AO now. There were going to be 4 Russians for the semis and the final.   Serena was not going to let that happen.     So, being white myself, it has got nothing to do with race. I love them both as they make women tennis more exciting and energetic with their powerful serves, like men.    So it will be an interesting final to watch between the Americans and the Russians. I would go swimming or go to a cinema if 2 Russians were in the finals.  May the best player win. Go Serena and go Safina.|`|p6zY2TVhaa	Well...i think it is a combination, because I dont think people dislike them all for the same reasons.  1. They're good. If someone comes along beating the players you like, you would tend to dislike them. Plus their game is a power, which may not be the traditional style, and we know there are alot of old school people  2. Their confidence is somewhat piercing, even after they lose, especially Serena. She gives little credit to other players most time when she is beaten. That confidence though, is based on her knowing how good she is, but most people have bad days.  3. I believe race is still an issue. Whoever thinks that there are no racial people existing out there, then you live in a a bubble. Most times, both the sister are attractive, nice bodies etc, but still you say comments. I know looks are a preference thing, but your lack of a preference doesnt mean they are ugly.     They are good players, personable etc. People have their preferences and at the end of the day, they are two of the best players in the world, whether liked on not liked.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't dislike them.  I think they are amazing.|`|Hzzdalavaa	Because they dominate the womens game and win most things.|`|SFL8VnOuaa	I'd like to see them try to come back to the Pacific Life Open and get Boo'ed off the Court!|`|MAAxboH7aa	we don't hate them. we just hate roger. or maybe that's just me ;p|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I don't really like Serena because to me she always gave the impression of not being a very nice person, but I do like Venus a lot!|`|e7B8WkkIaa	Mostly people do not like them because of the antics of their father. When they were young, they were kind of punky and dad was a dick. The media gave him no love and it crossed over. They do not seem too interested in image and so it goes.   I like them better than I did when they were young. But still do not really care for them.     It has nothing to do with race. So get over that right away. You cannot celebrate every black victory and say it is others that draw attention to these issues. Go, strong black woman and women.   Anyway...  Rafa is fan and media friendly. He is a different animal entirely.|`|QGuxbItCaa	Sisters? I thought they were brothers.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	Here we go again. The black issue. If you want to hear someone play the race card, listen to their father.|`|nE9BaUWIaa	I never realised that. Obama has his work cut out.|`|iD3XXaMOaa	I dont hate Serena & Venus at all. On the contrary, I simply love the way they play Tennis. If there's anything I hate about them, its the grunting. Again, thje sisters are very arrogant. We all know the ridiculous comments Serena has made in the past. She thinks that nobody other than her can play Tennis. Her biggest problem is that she refuses to give credit to the opponent when she gets beaten.    I hate people who hate them coz they are black. Tsonga and James Blake are two of my favorite players and they are not white either.    Other than the above stated reasons, if there's anything that most people hate about them is that they win too much. Its always frustrating to see them win all the time when you are supporting another player. Federer is one of the most humble and down to earth person. But why do ya think Federer has so many haters in this section? Its because he wins so much and fans of other players can stand that.    I agree that its time people realise that Serena & Venus are two of the best Tennis players ever amongst women.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	I don't know, maybe for their being so dominant over most players who happen to be the hater's favourite players/idols, and winning most of the slams in recent years in combine, like what happen in the fans between Nadal and Federer. I like the both players very much, especially the elder one, Serena has been great. The only times when I dislike Serena is her being rude in words to her opponent/umpire. Recently, I feel a little unfair from the matches Serena has gone through (the heat issue during Australian Open). So I dislike her being the 'beneficiary' in favouritism of the AO authorities/organizers (they slightly favour the higher seeds/higher profile players) when the she got a little of the luck to advance (Azarenka's withdrawal due to the heat - unclosed roof & energy restore of Serena when the roof was closed in the middle of the quarterfinal match) to as far as the semifinal. But in the semi, she really performed well, but I'm sad Dementieva had to lose to her in that match. Despite being sad for the slipping away of Dementieva's golden chance, I look forward to the final of Serena and Safina. Bravo the two finalists!|`|LKVTY2EPaa	Serena is my favorite player ever, and I also really like Venus. I think people dislike them because of a combination of their father making them look bad (as you see he no longer attends their tournaments) and because it's natural for people to hate athletes. You have to hate someone right? I don't particularly like Murray or Sharapova, and I absolutely despise Jankovic mostly because I want to. It just happens. I don't think it's a race thing. Maybe at the beginning it was, but now I think it has become irrelevant because they have become household names (even people who don't watch tennis know who Venus and Serena are).|`|xLyNsywiaa	I dislike Serena cuz of her attitude after a loss, but I absolutely love Venus...
Z1BtUmC2aa	You need to show your dad that you are a responsible adult now and are capable of handling your own life. Show him some of the pros of kickboxing:    Your keeping fit.   Those who do sports do better at school.  Tend to be more responsible.  Learn how to work with others.  Less likely to be involved in drugs and alcohol.  Higher self esteem.  Social activity.  Learning great self defense techniques.    Here is an article that shows why kickboxing is not dangerous:    http://www.centralkickboxing.org/Article...    He also may think that you are going through a phase and won't want to do it in a month so be persistant. Go out to Borders or somewhere and get a kickboxing workout video.

nvQHFcFpaa	Go onto this link:     http://www.fermedefavard.com/    It's an equestrian centre that I've recommended a lot of people to. I work on a campsite a few miles from Sarlat, and we send all our clients there.  It's very professional, well run, and they speak a bit of English, although the web site appears to be all in French (click on 'access au site' at the top left of the intro page to get into the site).    Alternatively, you could phone Sarlat tourist office and ask them - they speak perfect English and are there exactly for questions like that - phone number 00 33 5 53 31 45 45.      Have a good time on your holiday - I'm sure you'll love the region - don't forget to try the duck and the truffles whilst you're here!|`|S2tBYhCKaa	Quebec Nationalists use the term, revanche du berceau, to describe  nag rides they themself would urge their Pro-French population.

Klw3Ke3Haa	Congratulations to Wake Forest. I am sure that a lot of UNC fans are happy at seeing Duke fall. As for draft picks, Aminu has all the potential to be the next Rudy Gay. Teague is lighting it up like the next Deron Williams. While Johnson has all the potential to be a Jeff Green elemental player as possibly a mid-late 1st rounder. While Chas McFarland I still think will get drafted because the NBA teams need a key big men to eat up minutes.
QlrIUIfOaa	I don't see it.  He owns Baltimore - a move to Dallas would cost him millions off the field.  If I was his financial adviser I'd tell him to stay put and maximize the Ray Lewis brand.  That means Baltimore.    You are right about Phillips - he is not the problem.    You are right and wrong about TO (Spagnola is a DFW sports writer, don't believe a word any of them say.)  TO is a problem, but the real problem is Jerry Jones.  Jones has screwed this team worse that Bush did the economy.  He thinks of himself as a kingmaker and puppet master.  Yet, aside from picking the Vikings pockets, he has the reverse Midas touch.      Why not trust DFW sports writers?  None of them, and I mean none, have the testicular fortitude to take on Jones.  He gets a complete pass.  Oh yeah, a softball or two.  But Switzer, Galey, Campo and now Phillips get killed in the media.  Who hired these guys?  Why not believe the writers?  They need access to the team to make their living.  If they were even the least bit honest about Jones they would run the risk of getting cut off.  Jones is the problem.    EDIT: Granted, TO is a good player, but he contributes to the circus atmosphere in Dallas.  I'm not sure a 35 (something) year old player is worth the baggage.  I'd get rid of Pacman (gone), Tank (going) and TO (I'm hopeful).  Roy Williams will do the job.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I'm sure Dallas Cowboys fans are hoping that he signs, but its not likely.  The rumor mill is constantly swirling about Ray Lewis, but if you noticed, he hasn't said that he wants to leave the Ravens.  There are two reasons why not.  The first reason, is that he loves Baltimore.  Most players do not get to finish their careers with the same team they were drafted for.  A lot of that reason is because of the free agency period of these days.  Secondly, Ray Lewis wants to get another championship in Baltimore.  The Ravens franchise only has one championship and that was during the 2000 season.  He was apart of one of the greatest defenses of our modern day history.  Why would he walk away from a team that is so close to going back?  The Ravens need him for their leadership.  He is the face of that franchise.  The Cowboys would do anything to get a playoff win including throw money at Ray Lewis.  They are desperate for the pieces to get to the super bowl.  The problem with Dallas is not their defense.  They can add all of the defensive pieces they want, but if their offense and their head coach does not invoke responsibility then it is a lost cause.  Don't get me wrong, the Cowboys have talent, but they lack accountability from Wade Phillips.  Even if Lewis is signed it doesn't warrant a playoff win or great success, he is one player not the whole team.  If he is signed it would surprise the heck out of me.|`|HLzS2z9laa	I dont see Ray leaving his defensive kingdom, even thou 30 million for 3 years is not a bad deal at all|`|8vCzgOlpaa	None, he will retire a Raven there is no way they are letting him go|`|C2CCbTRKaa	snowball in hell has a better chance.|`|u7GBP579aa	no personally  i think it will be a bad idea because they need to bring youth to that position. Right know i think they still have zach thomas who is probally going to retire and signing ray lewis will be dum because he only has a couple more season left. Plus ray lewis wants to finish his carrer with the ravens, but if it so happens that he has to go, the best situation for him would be the jets. Because his x defensive coordinator rex ryan is now the head coach there.|`|MQMregbvaa	oh yeah man your right on trak go dallas we wont ray lewis to kill there offense|`|uoEfoI7aaa	SLIM TO NONE...

GombKA8Kaa	Basically back in the 1900's Tennis was only really played in the countries UK, France, US and Australia. These 4 countries players dominated the tennis circuit.    Therefore that is how the Grand Slam was created aswell as the Davis Cup, playing for your country was a very important honour for players at that time. It is based on Tradition and the start of world tennis. Tennis was an amateur sport and this was what the players played for.    When Tennis turned professional, that is when more tournaments where added to make a full blown professional sport where you can play all over the world and earn rankings to play in major tournaments and to earn money.    So basically the four Grand Slam tournaments are the most important tennis events of the year in terms of world ranking points and prize-money awarded, But most important the Grand Slam are the beginning of Modern Tennis and professional sport and there can never be any other tournaments that can take their place.    In saying that, the closest thing to this is the Masters which takes the top 8 ranked players in the world at the end of the year and play off against each other for the highest prizemoney and ranking.|`|NPioEHKWaa	The 4 grand slams are basically the 4 major tennis tournaments of the year.  This can't be changed unless the governing body wanted to make a massive move which is very unlikely.|`|iD3XXaMOaa	In old days, there werent so many ATP tournaments as now. Basically, there were these four grand slams and a few other tournaments. As you might know, Tennis was not always a professional sport. This is called the Open era but there was time not too long ago when Tennis was considered as an amatuer sport.    So, considering all these, I think the honour of hosting a grand Slam was only given to countries which had the infrastucture and the money to host such a major event. USA, England, France & Australia were the major countries in the world of Tennis in early days. The other countries took up the sport seriously later when Tennis came into Open era.

XrCc85kNaa	He will suck it up in Oakland....  His value will decrease like crazy in the FA next year...|`|FfIqGrdkaa	His average will stay the same or go up, but his power numbers will go down. I look for him to bat .325 with 22 homers and 90 RBIs. And then in the offseason will sign a 6 year 108 million dollar contract because hes the best hitter on the market and reprsented by Boras.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	His numbers will decrease.    Coors Field was (is) a hitter's paradise; Oakland is a big park where homers don't fly out.  He'll probably lose 10-15 homers just by playing home games in Oakland and not Denver.|`|39d2f170b7ab29e80de1d05e4c44248baa	Contrary to what's been previously posted, his HR numbers won't drastically decrease, mostly due to the subpar pitching in the AL West (Outside of LA). What's going to hurt him most is playing 81 games in Oakland where there's a ton of foul ground and balls that would ordinarily reach the stands in Colorado will now be outs. I look for .300 with 28-32 HR's RBI  's will be down as will runs scored.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Holliday has always performed well outside of Colorado. And while he'll lose a few HRs hitting in Oakland, the majority of the AL ballparks are 'very' hitter friendly. Add in a DH hitting behind him, and the watered down AL pitching, and he's likely going to have a fairly successful year.|`|7zfcYRqwaa	His power numbers will decrease, but you have to remember that he is not a power hitter, he is a line drive hitter with pop.|`|2wAPwZ1kaa	Colorado started putting game balls in a humidifier, the number of HR's in Coors Field dropped drastically since then. It's only advantage now is the thin air affecting curve balls from breaking. Holliday is probably going to still hit for average and see a slight decrease in his HR totals, due to better pitching in the AL West.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	His numbers might not be that good. Last season he had a slump late in the year. Now he is changing over to a new stadium and he is switching leagues. Sometimes when guys switch over leagues their numbers are horrible in the first year. Holliday is a good hitter though and I think he will be able to make the adjustment.

AA10427951	Play that is the first way.  Play as much and as often as possible.  Play against the best players in your area.  Play local tournaments both grass and sand.  Play indoors when its too cold, play outdoors when its not.  When you feel that you are one of the best around play some more then travel to some tourneys outside your area.  When you are consistently  competing at a high level.  Then find a AVP qualifier and try your luck.  Many of the pros played indoors along with outdoors to get a good base of form, technique and knowledge of the game then took it to the beach.  I wouldn't get a coach right away unless they are coaching an indoor team.  The best coach is to play.|`|085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	It really depends on where in Texas you live?

He can very well take down many Tennis stars in the Men's rank.    Djokovic Vs Venus====Djokovic. Venus is like a walking stick. Anyone can beat her like a pulp.      Nadal Vs Safin====Safin.

Nadal keeps bending down to re-tie his shoes and tighten the tape around his knees, providing Tsonga routine opportunities to attack.    A-Rod.  He punches Fed in the face at 349 mph, the fastest punch recorded in the galaxy, knocking Fed out cold.    Fed.  Serena sees him approach and begins dutifully making a ham-and-swiss on rye.  Fed seizes the opportunity and attacks.    Venus.  Djoker steps into the ring, slips on a "water spill" and "twists an ankle."  As he whines to be taken out of the ring, Venus kicks him in the torso several times, much to the roaring delight of the crowd.    Safin.  Would've been a close fight, but Nadal picked his *** so much his right hand got sucked in.  And since he's not really a lefty, he got pwned.

Ray Allen and Peja Stojakovic are here too,Ray is not the best shooter.He's more catch and shot type player and when he gets his stroke it's hard to defend but he and any great shooter can be stopped from great defenders.Ray Allen gets his hot three point shooting from the corners more hot spots for him and clutch with the quickest release in the nba.  Peja Stokajovic-Great shooter and specily from the corners for downtown,we have seen that spot as the hottest spot for him.

KijAnaKHaa	I like your move, bringing in Daniels. Many people dont realize it but this guy is performing under the radar. Pretty consistent too and Indiana isnt that deep so expect him to produce behind Granger.     For your team, right now, i would choose team 2. Just imagine Randolph becomes healthy, you got 5 legitimate rebounders over there. Scoring aint a problem coz almost everyone produces good numbers on given nights. =)    But, great move putting Daniels over there buddy =)|`|Qyw9yTYFaa	You have 2 good teams there. I might have kept Battier due to the fact the rockets players get injured quite a bit. He will get playing time and hell get you your steals and assists and 3s. Daniels does good too though in steals and 3s. I just like Battiers game a little bit more hes an all around stat guy. He'll get you points, rebs, blocks, steals and assists in a game. With one injury after another he will get to play. But overall you have 2 fairly good teams. With Harris playing the way he is now and the rest of your first team I would have to go with the first team over the second.|`|nDzenpkwaa	I like team two better as well.  I would try and trade Yao. He is prone to get hurt for the rest of the season.    In my league I just traded Yao and KG for Chris Paul. Now I have  Wade  Paul  Duhon  Calderon  and I won't miss KG cause I have Durant, Murphy and Shaq    You could probably trade Yao for two good players and drop one your mediocre players.    I think team one is pretty solid, you have a couple injury problems there with ILGUASKAS and Marion. Beasley is real streaky too...|`|a46b5a4e31721d81f61d716c33bd388daa	yes, the move is pretty good, although shane battier is pretty clutch in my opinion.    i like your second team better, mostly because im a david lee fan, but i would use that team over the first

v9hxcvkfaa	Denver's future of leading their division hinges on a couple of things:    - Playing Well After All-Star Break  ... if they come off All-Star break playing how they are currently playing, they'll be good, but teams tend to have to warm back up.    - Health  ... Nene is finally showing what he can be when he's healthy    - Trade  ... Not many teams can survive a major trade, another one they might not gel so quickly after it.

Not unless they go on some kind of losing streak.|`|RSBBPYDWaa	Portland is a good, young team and I think they will give the Nuggets fits in the future (even next year). But as for now, with Melo back, Denver has nothing to worry about.|`|FTYJbQaDaa	nope they cant catch us|`|kFcdwVwdaa	Melo is an offensive player. he has a few rare times where he actually stops someone. when melo gets in his own little mind set, he becomes a one man team. (like younger kobe). he wants to shoot the ball first whether its a good shot or not. sometimes he makes them most of the time he doesn't and a lot of the times, the shots he takes are dumb. you may see it as a good thing bc you get your scorer back, but at the same time if he is in a slump and he keeps shooting, what makes the other team from not catching up in the game? if they lose some of those games then portland might catch up. but i don't think its portland that will do the damage this season. wait until next year. when utah gets healthy its a different story.
JD5NQxeNaa	I do not know. I always said, this guy has the talent to be a force. He led the NBA in FG% twice. Being, the only Bulls to ever accomplish this and he did it when Shaq was in his prime. He also has shutdown the dominant force that is DH12 on many of occasion. He has a reliable 8-10 foot game besides having quick footwork down low and dominant power.    His problem is he is a fat and lazy sloth that gets out rebounded by PG's mind have you even with that massive frame of his. He is also slow and fat. I really feel sorry for the man ever since Randolph was paired with him he stopped being the 20+ PPG player and not only that he was robbed at gun point this summer, he had an irregular heartbeat and is only 26, his driver wanting $ came up with an inconceivable sexual harassment charge, and now his gf and infant son was killed. I truly feel sorry for the man for his hardships and losses as of late. Hopefully, he can get his career to where it was going on another team that could utilize his strengths and hide his flaws.    A good opportunity would be Indiana they need an offensive Center that can dominate the inside game. They have 2 very good reliable Centers, but they are offensively limited. Curry is defensively and rebound wise limited - while Foster and Nesterovic are great in those areas. They could check and balance each other out and make for a nice Center trio and Hibbert is in the wings, so a quad they will make.    Indiana could give the Knicks Marquis Daniels, who is very good and versatile. But, there is a logjam @ SG/SF w/ Mike Dunleavy coming back and Indiana wants to go through Dunleavy more, since its an offensive team. Daniels gives both offense and defense and would help my Knicks out. Indiana throws in Travis Diener who is a very good shooter that does not get minutes cause he plays behind Ford and Jack who play 28-32 mpg a night.|`|TbEwkoQDaa	No one does expect this tragic event for Eddy,  fans and NBA society is expressing their condolence for Eddy's family.

hBUf7EjRaa	to answer this question, one must do without their personal agenda against any one of this three teams.  therefore biasness aside, let us view the criteria that define a 'big club'    1. GLORY(we have to discard domestic triumphs because all three teams play in different leagues and thus domestic trophies are an unfair gauge of team's supremacy)  on this account, we have to use the champions league as a platform.   REAL MADRID has won the competition the most number of times(9)    2. PLAYERS(again, there will be an endless argument whether zidane, ronaldo, cantona, kaka, figo is the best.)  on the account of most number of FIFA world player of the year awards won: REAL MADRID with 4  on account of most ballon d'or wons: AC MILAN with 6    3. FINANCES( as of 2008)  REAL MADRID with 513.48m     4. FAN BASE/FOLLOWING  undeniably MANCHESTER UNITED     these are just some of the criteria that i've managed to come up with. some might argue that at the moment Manchester United are the undisputed World, Europe and English Champions, therefore they are the best team at the moment.    but to answer the question of which of the three is the bigger club? then, the answer in my point of view is still Real Madrid(for now)|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	lmao at the first answer    Real Madrid is BY FAR the biggest club here and Man Utd is easily 2nd|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Manchester United|`|A4W6YLS0aa	AC Milan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|kOcBfbRraa	If by "bigger" you mean, Who will win 4 trophies this year ? -- EPL, FA Cup, Carling Cup and Champions League............then MAN UNITED, easiest answer ever.|`|idT8xm0taa	Real Madrid|`|3ZrTiVFCaa	Man Utd obviously     Last season - won - Epl,Champions league & Community shield.

And at the end of the day I would say it is AC Milan because they have some winning history of their own. Dude MAN UTD is not suppose to be here, sure they have won stuff but not that much, plus they are English so the are lame.|`|X1ij46peaa	i din't like one of then but... i would have to say man utd|`|Z11DKA9Gaa	ac milan|`|hL4u2kv2aa	and for juventus??  but for your question, I think that manchester united now is the bigger club, but AC Milan, don't jokes: Ronaldinho, Beckham and other samples...

I'm Italian...|`|EJyZ5D0yaa	Manchester united because it is the latest club who won the european cup and they have popular players such as ronaldo (player of the year) etc.|`|QVDJi2GTaa	Real Madrid!|`|ZiOGqEp2aa	I think man utd because they have many skilled player liked Cistiano Ronaldo , Wayne Rooney and much more.|`|1NwjxaVZaa	MAN UTD!!!!|`|3pbrt34qaa	real madrid, it has joined most of the popular players and experienced the true meaning pf team work and football.

It was time to start making some bad trades and tear the team down to its usual status.  I don't know.  The trade makes no sense.  They should've kept Cedeno.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	i feel bad for u guys, now u will know the pain mets fans have been going thro for 4 yrs|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Fresh off the Cubs Convention I was geeked for this year..... I got home from work yesterday & the 1st Q I clicked on was about the trade. I thought it was an early April Fools joke so I looked it up & about YAHOO CENSOR in my pants. I was under the impression Olsen was trade bait for Peavy now it's gonna cost us Marshall, Hart  & Vitters....... I say give up on Peavy save Vitters to take over for Ramy|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	Um, because the Cubs SUCK, so it makes sense to get a player that sucks.|`|lC5NLsZZaa	This has to do with Baseball.    I like it better when we talk about your chocolate hamster, GCG.  Go back to that.    Thanks.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	They needed someone who will be the workhorse delivering the paper for the tribune, and this way Ronny Cedeno can finally become a decent player.|`|EtEf098yaa	Well, first off, Cedeno and Oslon suck too so it was a trade off.  They wanted to clear off some roster space (2 for 1) and now if they don't move to get peavy they'll have another SP option.   And I only think he sucked b/c he's wanted to get out of NY for about 2 or 3 years now.  If anyone needs a new team it was definitely him.  Its a gamble, if he's good great, if not, they didn't give up anything for him.|`|jENl8y24aa	He should fit in well.|`|3FFAIMpLaa	Why would anyone care, knowing full well that the Cubs suck?|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Would they be the Cubs otherwise?
bYK9AX8Raa	Hockey requires anaerobic effort, in which oxygen is used from the bloodstream faster then can be replaced.  During pregnancy the respiratory rate is naturally increased as the body works harder to provide oxygen to the developing fetus, which reduces the amount of oxygen available for exercise.  This already reduced oxygen level combined with the natural ?oxygen debt? caused by playing hockey can cause decreased endurance and breathlessness and can shift needed oxygen away from the uterus.    Hockey requires many sudden starts, stops, turns, jumps, pivots and sprints.  During pregnancy the body releases a hormone called relaxin, which loosens up the joints of the pelvis to make room for childbirth.  Relaxin affects all the joints in the body making the body more susceptible to injury from the sudden movements of hockey.  Also, because of the enlarging womb, the women?s center of gravity shifts causing changes to balance and posture that may effect playing.    During pregnancy, the body increases its blood volume by 40% and heart rate increases by about 15 beats per minute.  This allows nutrients to be transported to the fetus more efficiently.  However, with the growth of the womb, the flow of blood in the body can be disrupted and lightheadedness can occur.    Also, with high-flying sticks and balls, even a mild injury to the stomach can be serious when pregnant.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	I think it would depend on how far along she is.  If she is more than a few months, I would be concerned about falling - never a good idea while pregnant.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	No possible way!!  Not so serious answer-  How can the woman see the puck at her feet if she's pregnant?Sheeeesh....Wonder the same thing with Broduer but that's a different argument for a different time.    REALLY not so serious answer-  No she can't play because she's a woman....Kidding girls|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I'm going to try to provide a serious answer.    To answer your question, this is probably something that the woman should discuss with her doctor.  If she's playing a non-contact version (or shinny), the low-impact exercise from skating is probably good.    From what my sister has told me about this stuff, the woman would probably need to make sure she stays properly hydrated before, during, and after.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	The short answer is yes.    One member of the 2006 Swedish Women's team was 4 months pregnant during the tournament.    Manon Rheaume also played a couple of games for Canada internationally while knowingly pregnant with her first child.|`|G33E41IBaa	It depends on how long the woman has been carrying the baby.  If she's been pregnant for 2 months, yes.  If she's 8 months pregnant, hell no!!    Actually, doing physical, but not strenuous, exercise is actually good when you're pregnant.  It strengthens the muscles and makes birthing much easier.  In women's hockey there's no hitting, so I'm sure up to a certain number of months of pregnancy the woman can still play.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	I dont think 4th graders should be allowed on the computer.|`|sZj3qWMUaa	Nope|`|naZQqrNeaa	Only if you like your eggs scrambled.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	r u serious no women should play ice hockey let alone when their pregnant ................stupid question dude sorry|`|Z5akjbOOaa	I'm sure it will be fine....|`|G2ex4HYuaa	man are u nuts!?HELL naw...|`|Icze35Nqaa	Yes but I wouldn't recommend it.|`|AA10068004	Of course one could... but why would one risk it? Its nine months... the game will still be there after the birth.|`|AA12089021	My wife discussed this with her doctor.  Her best friend is a hockey player and being married to a hockey player, we were both pushing to get her on the ice.    His recommendation was that she could skate until she began to show.  That would sync with the time frames that the woman LITY referred to playing.  The doctor was aware of the risk of a big collision or a stray puck to the belly.  The doc said there was little, if any risk.|`|BqIyO3x3aa	uhm no im pretty sure that kid would have birth defects

739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	Yes a driver can be a success without winning a Championship.  Our fellow members of NASCAR Nation have provided us with several examples.  But you see that doesn't matter to the folks that feel the need to drag Junior threw the coals at every opportunity they get.  Junior has a lot of fans and folks dislike him for that.    Let's take a little looky-poo at Junior's career stats.      Sprint Cup - Races-327   Wins-18   Top 5-86   Top 10-136  Poles-8     Nationwide - 22 wins and 2 Championships     Winner of the All-Star race XVI    2004 Daytona 500 winner.    Hmmmm....it's not to shabby huh?      Junior IS a success in my book.  The only folks complaining are the the ones that have nothing better to do than b**ch.  No offense to anyone.  I don't hear Junior's team, team-mates, owners or sponsors complaining about Junior's accomplishments so I can't even give a thought to this dude's article.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Yes. It happens in every sport.. Dan Marino in football, John Stockton and Karl Malone in basketball, Ted Williams in baseball.  Why would NASCAR be any different? There are always great athletes in professional sports who will be celebrated for their greatness who people will always say "if only he had a championship"..    Just my opinion.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Yes they can...there are a lot of greats that never won a championship.  Anyone who makes it in NASCAR and sticks around is a success.|`|JLayHNZCaa	JB doesn't know jack.  DJ has more than earned his pay check.  If he had never led a lap, won a race, or made the top ten, his name alone has paid for his career.  Look how long it took his dad to win Daytona.  It is all relative.  DJ may never win a championship, but he is already a champion.|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	Robby Gordon will probably never win a Nascar championship; but he is a success in nascar and all the other motor sports he races in.    Jr.  He is still young and has a whole life of racing ahead of him.  He will win a championship at sometime.  But if he does not; he will still be considered a success.  He is a success already in my book.|`|n55igpCUaa	Mark Martin. Enough said.    And Busbee is correct.|`|zii6IWHoaa	It would be hard to call Mark Martin unsuccessful and he has never won a championship and even though I don't like Jr. , He probably sells 10 times his contract in merchandise|`|kYYDOJzSaa	There can't be two number ones!!!    That would be 11!!!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	That would just depend totally on one's definition of "success"  I doubt any of the drivers out there who have had nice careers and won some races but no championships  consider themselves to be losers.|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	yes and I think Dale Jr. is a success. Jay Busbee is a idiot if he doesn't think  that Jr. earns his paycheck.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	Mark Martin comes immediately to mind. Junior Johnson, Ricky Rudd, heck, even Jeff Burton--those are some other guys who are successes without championships. I'm sure there are several more I don't know about from farther back.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Yes. Mark Martin as an example.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	Yeah I think so. If you can race at the cup level for several years and stay in the top 25 you have succeeded. Championship or not. You making it to the cup level is a success.|`|YQLLxGNWaa	of course. mark martin has done exactly that    of course there are always going to be people like t-bone with double standards. junior hasn't earned his paycheck because he hasn't won a championship he says. but i'll bet ya a steak dinner he wouldn't make the same statement about mark martin or kyle busch.|`|52Ycgnozaa	yes it is possible. Mark Martin had a very successfull career and odds are he will never get a championship.|`|5Hh4Stj8aa	Junior Johnson, Ricky Rudd, Mark Martin, Fred Lorenzen, and Buddy Baker are the living embodiment of bridesmaids. They were huge names without even needing a title (however I still believed Mark Martin got screwed in 1990).|`|VQHGqYXvaa	tony n    Said it all he got to it before i did .They were the best of the best I THINK !!|`|iHIEp8Fzaa	Yes, Mark Martin is a prime example of that! 2nd in points 4 times, 35 Cup wins, and 48 Nationwide series wins. He owned IROC for awhile and holds many records that may never be broken. I consider him a success. Dale Jr. is already a success even if he never wins another race.  Peace!|`|PGlZn1wEaa	Jr needs to earn his paycheck.  Last year was put up or shut up and this year its sink or swim.  Jay didn't say he was not successful.   JAy merely stated its time for better results.    I read that article last night and knew it was a matter of time before being misconstrued by JR nation.  Jay was spot on Lenny.  Like an arrow on a bullseye.|`|1mSgtDmuaa	Yep. Jr will get his one day.
13XU8cCKaa	I see them making the playoffs.  Without Redd the Bucks will not make it.  The young rookies of the Nets are hitting the rookie wall which is why they are struggling.  Before the trade the Knicks were a great team but then they made the trade and it led to them struggling.  Now they are playing like they did befpre the trade and the Knicks are a dangerous team.  I can even see them steal that 6th spot.  This is how I see the Eastern Conference playing out though.  1.  Cleveland Cavaliers  2.  Boston Celtics  3.  Orlando Magic  4.  Miami Heat  5.  Atlanta Hawks  6.  Detroit Pistons  7.  New York Knicks  8.  Philadelphia 76ers|`|1TgIuZMqaa	i'm not gonna lie, i see the Raptors squeezing into that last spot, their just too goof 2 have the record that they have, and momentum seems 2 be changing the last couple days...so watch out.|`|GMmmbLGRaa	Phuck the knickerbockers!!'    GO LAKERS!|`|ClQ9yJweaa	No odubt. In the Weak East, a team can finish under 500 and make playoffs. D'Antoni has Knicks playing good ball as of late, but surely he needs them to get some D and fast. They have enough scoring but without D, they will hover around the 500 and under mark and if getttign into playoffs will eb a very short stint.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Yes, go Knicks and if LBJ23 does not come to MSG in 2010, which I think will be the case Redd would not be a bad option lol. I would even prefer it cause Redd's better shot would work wonders in a D'Antoni offense. Being that the mantra is shoot in 7 seconds or less and create spacing. Redd has the quickest release in the game and is great in creating spacing. I think he is 2nd only to RIP in creating spacing for himself in the entire NBA.    Anyways, my Knicks are doing great and I think we can pull off another 1999. We have a great coach and if we head the playoffs in rolling fire fashion who knows what can happen. If we get 7th, hopefully Orlando gets 2. If we get 6th, hopefully Orlando gets 3rd. We pose a chance w/ Orlando all we have to do is contain Hedo and Rashard really. They are the only ones that can play great against our uptempo system. Nelson could too, but he has the reputation of choking in the playoffs.    Pietrus, Bogans, and Johnson, and maybe even Reddick can play in this system, but they are not difficult to stop. If we hold the Lewis/Hedo duo in check I like our chances. DH12 is a beast, but his offensive game besides dominating the paint is very limited. He is very strong and can dunk, but he is not fast with that muscular build of his, so he will be out of his element against the uptempo system that is the Knicks. If we tire him out he will be rendered limited being that he will be too tired to dominate the paint. Then what does he do, he hasn't got a mid  range game and other than Gortat, the only C sub that can play against Mike D's  system. Usually, never gets mpg and Battie and Foyle sure as hell can not keep up with a Mike D team.

lPDHMOVZaa	As a corner back you have to focus on the receiver. It's hard not to look at the quarterback, but you have to focus on the receiver, otherwise he could disappear on you and then your burned.     Stay with the receiver and watch his eyes, when he looks at the quarterback than you can too. Find the ball when it's in the air and make a play on it, but you have to stay with the receiver... you don't have the luxury of roaming like a safety does.     That is for "man" coverage schemes... in a zone, you have a little more luxury. You can watch the quarterback more and try to jump routes... but you have to make sure that you stay in your zone as you are responsible for any receiver who enters it.|`|u7GBP579aa	i use to play free saftey and it is all about balance and hip contorol. try not to turn your back until you see the ball comes out. you normally have to play off your wideout so you can watch his every movement then every now and then look at the QB and make your move. But the reason you never want to turn your back is you want to make the move before the wideout does.|`|wf9RHP3Eaa	Start by playing the receiver and watch his eyes. Most will look to where they are going to cut before they make their move. Most importantly, when the receiver turns to look for the ball, you have to turn your head- at that point you play the ball, not the receiver. If you have a play on the ball, make it, but if not, you have to be in position to make the tackle. With experience, you'll get better at finding passing lanes and getting between the QB and the receiver. Cardinal rule for starting out- PLAY THE DEEP PASS- don't let yourself get burned. If you have to, play off the line of scrimmage as much as 8 or 10 yards, but don't let the receiver get behind you for an easy score.|`|06qRRwbNaa	You can help a coach.

It was worse than taking Gerrard off Touz - simple.

Cause United is paying him to make sure Liverpool never win the EPL.|`|AA12122904	You need to play your best players to win games, he had stopped all that rotation nonsense at the beginning of the season and they looked like genuine title contenders.  Now he seems to be returning to it and it just isn't working - Gerard has to play for Liverpool to win games.  As for the Ferguson rant - Sir Alex must have been rubbing his hands when he seen just how much he had gotten to his rival manager.  With Rafa heading for the nuthouse and Gerard heading for the big house things aren't looking very promising for Liverpool just now.|`|AA11447659	You can find Rafas outburst funny and some people say true but what he did that night was attack another team, it showed that he is feeling the pressure because there really wasn't any need for it and your results show that it did you no favours.

cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	You and I can assume it but there is no way anyone cam prove it.  No matter what happens his career will always be tainted. Looking unbeatable against Cotto then getting caught with "questionable" taping then getting beat up sure looks suspicious.|`|CDeZOLmgaa	Margarito has been suspended so there is some validity to the wraps, the tests came back and it was a hardening agent. I would say historically Cotto has an excuse and It certainly will allow him an argument but It wont be reversed.    Im guessing that Margarito has always done this, why only for this fight with a guy most people thought would be a walk through would he decide to cheat and not against the younger hard hitting Cotto?|`|Ef4HdzEfaa	Ok lets clear a few things up  1 Cotto barely beat mosley ....and went into retreat mode a few times throughout that fight , that fight could have easily gone either way. With that being said that automatically takes away bragging rights on cotto's win over shane. In my eyes it calls for a rematch right away... unfortunatly cotto turned down the offer to give shane a rematch. (I wonder why?)    Ok and  2 you maynot know this or want to admit it but shane is a much better fighter than cotto all around. Its just that Shane is getting old so someone like cotto can at least hang with an aging shane mosley and be able to give him a close fight. Its hard to compare them by comparing how they each did against the same opponent because they are both 2 different fighters.    The bottom line is shane beat margarito because he has more tools in his bag than cotto does and lets face facts he is a lot smarter than miguel cotto. He doesnt crumble under pressure like cotto can and has a far better chin as well as better stamina. Far as the cheating goes none of this can even be proved for certain so the result of cotto vs margo will never be changed. It does raise suspiscions of course but because we dont know for certain yes margarito knocked cotto out (made him quit) and won that fight convincingly and possibly fairly. I dont think its safe to assume anything... yeah a big shadow is being raised over margarito in general right now which i can understand , but honestly whats done is done ... cotto got whooped  by margo and because of that may never be the same fighter again , loaded gloves or not we will never know. If they have a rematch that might help people get a better idea if margo did have loaded gloves for the first cotto fight. Judging by the way they both perform in a rematch.|`|Iq4qLnobaa	I have not heard about the hand wraps. I saw him pickup Cotto, but also get picked apart by Mosley. I guess we'll wait to see what comes out of this.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	How many of your guys are familiar with plaster of paris. Well I am very familiar. I am a Dental Lab Technician. We use plaster to fabricate dental casts. The same one doctors use to cast broken bones. Plaster of paris comes in powder substance and once mixed with water takes about 45 minutes to an hour to set. Once the plaster is set you cannot wet it again or it will weaken. Also it is impossible to place plaster of paris inside a glove, why? because in order for the plaster of paris not to break, it must be thick. otherwise plaster will break easy especially in a moist environment, it will start crumbling easy. With the first blow Margo throws, it will break in many small pieces. So for all you mofos talking all this when you are ignorant about plaster, Stop it now. First go buy the plaster, it is sold in dental Supply stores. Mix it with water to a melted ice cream consistency and put it on your fist, put a glove and pouch the bag and you will see that I am know what I am talking about.|`|72a8f6bb0546923e3c32d62e24eacb0caa	Attempted cheating.

If he did use a illegal substance on his hand wraps the commission will however deal with it. But the Cotto record will not be taken back regardless. Even though Margarito took every punch Cotto had to offer. The match may  have been decided by the judges perhaps in the favor of Cotto. As I remember Cotto did most of the punching in the beginning & middle rounds. So if Margarito cheated I don't think it took away much from Cottos' punch. However, there's different kinds of plaster that will harden in the presence of moisture.|`|Yrcf7HGAaa	I strongly believe Team Mosley decided to make false accusations in regards to Margarito using plaster while wrapping his hands was simply to take the bad news off Mosley.    Remember boxing fans prior to this fight there was talk all over the sport of boxing about Mosley cheating against Oscar De La Hoya by using steriods.    I don't buy it for any moment.  Margarito does punch hard he just did not fight back which is why Mosley survived without a bruise.  It looked like either Margarito sold out or Mosley used steriods to win haven't you boxing fans ever thought about that?

Gilly or Healy (in keeping only)====Gilly. Mate, he is the best ever Keeper by a long shot. Even in keeping only, I'll rate Gilly slightly higher than Healy. Gilly have taken quite a few blinders in his career.    Dhoni or Boucher====Boucher. Boucher has been around for a long time & is proven performer as well as a match winner. He has the record for most dismissals as well. Its only fair that I choose him.    Ponting or Graeme Smith====Ricky Ponting. He is my favorite batsman. I will be onest and say that I will choose him over any batsmen you give me. I know I am a bit biased when it comes to Punter but then none can argue against this great man's record. He is quite possibly the best batsman of this era.    Warner or Duminy (most explosive batsman)====Duminy. Warner has so far only showed his fire in the ODIs and T20s. JP Duminy on the other hand, has won a test match for SA. The way he played in tests, shows that he has got what it takes to become one of SA's premiere batsman in days to come.

Y4mz8BShaa	All airsoft guns use 6mm BB's, aside from some Marushin and Maruzen, which use 8mm BB's.    Use .12's in spring guns with less than 225 FPS with .20's.|`|wCVnav0Maa	Most pistols take .12 gram bbs. Most bbs are 6mm but the weight varies. If you find that these pellets seem like they are curving up and aren'tt going as straight move to a heavier bb like a .20 gram.|`|kJcCNie0aa	most likely 12m bbs, if not try 20m. you can get them at wal-mart in the hunting and outdoor department.
vqm10k3Jaa	Others have given good advice, so I'll say for the last of rather or not it gets easier.   Fact is that it does and you'll get better and when your done feel great.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	You are still young and should come up to speed fairly quickly if you keep it up each evening.   Push yourself a bit (but not through pain).    I suspect that unless you are significantly overweight  that you should be putting in a couple of miles without stopping within a few months.     If you are very overweight, take it easy as it can be hard on your joints.    One of my favorite quotes on running is:    You should not run to lose weight.   You should lose weight to run.        I also suggest augmenting your running with strength training and stretching.    It will accelerate your progress and have many health benefits.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I was the same way as you 10 months ago, I couldn't make it a block without dying.    Take your time, just relax and stop worrying how well everyone else is doing and just concentrate on yourself. Make sure you have a breathing technique that works for you, breathing takes time to master (for me it was a good 3 months before I found what worked for me and I get asthmatic when I run) and make sure you are wearing good supportive shoes.    Running is hard, it takes a long time to get from A) to B) and unless you're athletically inclined you have to work for it. When I first started I felt like a gorilla running plus I was touting 20 +lbs ontop. I've lost it now, and I'm in a good secure place now with running where I enjoy it. '    If I can do this, anyone can do it. Just don't give up and have fun with it!!|`|gBAstki5aa	start off with a slow jog. Make sure you teach yourself how to breathe slowly (in the nose, out the mouth). Over time increase the distance. Oh and don't stop, keep going daily. It'll be hard, but you'll see improvement in about a week.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Just take it easy and give it time.  You're just starting out, its going to be hard at first, but it does get easier.    Don't run any faster than you're ready for, this will only burn you out.  Run at a comfortable pace, and don't push if your body tells you NO.  The key to all of this isn't learning to RUN, its learning to LIKE running.  If you're out there killing yourself at something, its hard to learn to like it.  If you take your time, and build slowly towards a goal, you don't get tired of it and it doesn't feel as much like work.  You're not a professional, this isn't a job, its a hobby, and you want to enjoy hobbies.    I hope you can learn to love running as much as some of us do.  It will get easier, just give it time.  Good luck!|`|ocHNtbQZaa	The reason you are getting so tired and slow down is because you are not strong enough to support your body weight at ground contact. To increase your muscle support force try standing on one leg, on ball of foot, knee slightly bent and hold that position for as long as possible. Work up to a 5 minute continuous hold. Do holds on each leg 3-4 times a week. This will get you stronger and faster and running will be much easier.

peeNituyaa	Most certainly.  I have not read it but if it contains all these little dirty secrets etc. then I have lost all respect for the man.  First off, as a Manager of a team, you have players confidence and they tell you things based on trust.  A trust he is now betraying.  Second, if I was a LA Dodger, I would be careful what I said or did around him because again, I would not trust him.

Torre is a HOF and was treated like crap.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Not at all. He was abused by the Yankees, after he had turned that franchise from losers into the force they are today. Let's not forget what the Yankees were before Torre took over. The laughingstock of the AL, just ask Mattingly. What was it 13, 14 years without even a playoff appearance? Then after he knocks down a few World Series, and reels off 13 straight playoff appearances, they give him a joke of a contract offer, designed only to insult him and save face to the media. The Yankees can give Arod nearly 30 million a year, but can't find the cash to keep Torre? Please. I can just say that Torre's had more class than I would. I'd have been dishing out every little secret to any talk show I could get my hands on.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	How can it when the only thing you hear about it our headlines in the news?|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	it is not out yet is it??|`|6tGYe5roaa	Nope.

3m9DQuDRaa	The Bellas have been in wrestling a lot longer than Maryse has.  Maryse was originally going to just be a valet in the WWE, but she asked to be trained, so I give her credit for that.    Maryse isn't really all that talented in the ring, though.  Most of her moves are sloppy, and she doesn't always seem sure of herself when doing them.    The problem with the Bellas, though, is that they have no discerning qualities other than they're twins.  They can't really act, and I can't see ONE of them being a champ, but the tag division doesn't allow for a woman tag team (due to the WWE's newer policies on man/woman violence) though I really think it should.    In the end, Bellas are better in the ring, Maryse is a better character (though she's not really that much better as she's kinda bland as well...  it's sad that the women's division is so shallow in the WWE...)|`|S6iJSXseaa	maryse...duh|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Maryse|`|rjWlOAnEaa	The Bella Twins.

392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	The real question is if Sean had a gun would he have been able to defend himself.  Considering the fact that the other person also had a gun, the answer is probably not.  Sean would have had to shoot first and he may not have had that opportunity.  Having a gun does not guarantee you anything.  Responsible ownership and the ability to use a gun correctly may save your life in some circumstances.  Possessing a gun does not give you immunity from the other person's bullet.  If you are not able to be a responsible gun owner and are not willing to learn how to property use a gun, do not get one.  Guns do not kill people.  People kill people.|`|AA11154942	your misinformed|`|Vcbj2rqiaa	hes not stupid....hes just on the bears thts wuts wrong with him...its not his fault|`|u7GBP579aa	a lot of people said that when he first died out of frustration but no,  21 would have rather died then for his fiance' and baby to get hurt.

QlrIUIfOaa	Yes, I think that is a good idea.  The old saying "strike while the iron is hot" comes to mind.  After the playoffs end folks are still interested in watching football.  Playing the game between the playoffs and the SB fills that need.    As to the game, it's an all-star game.  It is an exhibition.  It is meaningless.  So why not wrap it around the SB festivities, in the same city, and try to expand the party.  If they had the PB in my city, DFW, I would consider going, if the cost was not out of control.|`|wxXguyK3aa	I guess it's a good idea, but shouldn't Hawaii have some football since they don't have a pro team?    Actually I heard they are doing this next year.  It's going to be some place in Florida a week before the SB.|`|ejrVotg8aa	I wouldn't be any more interested in it. To me I'd lose interest if non of the Super Bowl players are in it. Those are usually some of the best or most popular in the league. If the idea includes excluding players to me it's a bad idea. Not to mention if the game is in a city where the weather is cold or nasty the players aren't going to be less likely to want to play in it. Why would they want to travel to a cold destination.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	No. Most importantly, I think it would take the focus off of the Superbowl and that is not good.     To be selected to the Pro-Bowl is a privilege and an honor for the players... some really enjoy being their... others not so much. It should be their choice whether they want the honor or not. As you mentioned, players in the Superbowl obviously would not play... and in most cases there are several Pro-Bowlers in the Superbowl (just look at this year)... this wouldn't be fair to them.      I thought the Pro-Bowl was fine where it was and I disagree with the move.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I think so because after the Super Bowl, people lose intrest|`|Iq4qLnobaa	Sure why not? More people will watch it. Those players in the Super Bowl, won't play but the other deserving stars will. I think it's a great idea.|`|631d898eda9d1327e73c3f692a061adcaa	I still won't watch it|`|AA11154942	no because then anyone in the superbowl cant play... nothing can be done to the Pro-Bowl to garner mass interest by those who are voted in|`|Wz2lTWJ3aa	I guess my biggest objection is that it makes the superbowl players ineligible. Imagine this year's pro bowl without James Harrison, James Farrior, Troy Polamalu, Kurt Warner, Larry Fitzgerald, Anquan Boldin, Adrian Wilson, and Sean Morey. (those are all the starters) The superbowl teams are generally the teams with the superstar players to watch. Taking them out of the probowl will make it even less interesting to watch.|`|24UPDIBTaa	Players only care about it because of the prestige of adding Pro Bowler to their resume, a bonus in their contracts being triggered, or they enjoy hanging out with their contemporaries in Hawaii. Don't think I know any fan that gets excited about it. What to make of the change?    There's one red flag for me:    If the big game is played on a grass field, I wouldn't suggest they risk screwing up the surface the week beforehand with an exhibition game both fans and players have little interest in being played. Therefore, it should be a no-go unless there's either an artificial surface or a secondary site to host the game of lesser importance.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Who cares when it's played?  Hardly anyone judging by the ratings.    They should just save a lot of money and time by announcing who made the "All-Pro" team and not bother with the game at all.    Besides, it makes no sense to have an all-star game when the players from the two best teams cannot play in it.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I'm not interested in the Pro Bowl and probably will never be. It's a meaningless game that the majority of the players don't even want to be in. As far as I'm concerned, they could do away with the "game" altogether and it would not bother me a bit.
RGxMkT0zaa	Cricket gets all the limelight and attention in India. People love the Sports and it is a vicious circle. Revenue pours in. The cricketers are now well paid. They have their own business. BCCI is glaringly in the limelight.  All this attention causes jealousy too.   To top it, media gives them hype.   If other sports get enough sponsor, this will reduce. They just turn their anger on what is in front of them. The cannot abuse the Department or the Sports Ministers. Then they will not get any chance next time.|`|AA11088802	mAY BE SOME POLITICS|`|t7uuzjfHaa	good question  I agree 100%    I also think  that some sportsmen  are  taking the Padma Awards  for granted      The  Olympic  medalists and other great sportsmen like Kom  have done a great job for India and they deserve respect and praise.     But they should not be childish and  blame cricket for it.  Other sports  are  not popular,so you can't bring down cricket  to  make them(other sports)  more popular.     You can't force people to hate  or like cricket.  The  government should ensure  that they   are  just in giving away the awards and should consider achievers in all sports.     Blaming cricketers  or the game itself is wrong.     The administrators  of those sports should market them(their sports) well,rather than blaming cricket|`|sK3qibRwaa	It is because India`s national sport is  Hockey,but people always consider cricket has national sport unofficially,politics should be changed for this!|`|SWxnbKyyaa	Even I used to feel like that, like cricket hogs the lime light for everything.The main reason why they would have felt like that is probably because cricketers get a lot of publicity for anything an everything.Sachin's birthday will make more news than a player winning a competition in any other sport, is that fair???    Having said that we can't blame them can we, its not their fault    I wont say cricket is entirely to blame but also a little bit of the media because they are the ones who questions after every olympics get over "why one billion is not able to produce a medal" but at the same time they dont give any news if someone wins something in any other sport,from sponsors point of view, cant blame them much because they want money.The federation have a major part in this, they have not been able to market their sport well to attract sponsors and they have a lot of politics as well.    C'mmon mate, in today's world anything can be advertised, TBH we werent really good in cricket were we? but still we have been able to run the game very well .When even lame boring T.V serials are able to attract sponsors why not sports????    So a little effort is required from the federations running the game to market it well.So the actual blame is on the media as well as the people running the game|`|FNs7MZF4aa	Because the Government doesn't provide enough facilities and take interest in other sports than Cricket.    Cricket is the most popular game in India and BCCI is the richest board in world Cricket.  Where's Money there is respect and people run after it.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	Nobody stopped these people from playing cricket when young; instead the y decided to club each other in to pulp in the name of boxing or whatever. I think it is pure jealousy. Cricketers are not rushing to Rashtrapati Bhawan; they are invited and bestowed the honour. These people should accept it and try to win a few medals for india, and then ask for awards.
AA12251404	I think he has a great shot if he keeps his lifetime batting average over .300 (it is .310 now).  That is likely unless he sticks around too long trying to get the magic number of home runs 500 (has 408 now).    Although he has played multiple positions going from shortstop to LF to third base to LF and back to third base he has never been know as a wonderful fielder.  He will get there based on his offense---and he will get into the Hall of Fame.|`|GwawzO5Faa	He's a .310 life time hitter who will end up with better numbers than Jim Rice who got in so I say yes.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Not a sure bet.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	No doubt the writers will exploit the "character" and "integrity" clauses against Jones and hold him back for a few ballots due to his fathering a child out of wedlock.    Chhhyeah, right. I know the Hall means well, but vesting "character" and "integrity" evaluative responsibilities to a known gang of drinkers with writing problems really doesn't pass the second-sniff test.    Chipper has a very, very high probability of earning the plaque.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Definitely, Jones has been a star producer for year after year. It's amazing that he's only been around for 14 years, it feels like it's been longer, the amount of times he's been winning games for the Braves. He's only getting better too it seems, after the amazing season he put together last year. Losing a step? He seems to just be turning the corner. At this rate, 3000 hits and 500 HRs seems a real possibility for him. And for a switch hitter, that's amazing.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Yes. He's in.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Yes, he will need to play for a couple more years but he will make it!|`|4SKmjYrsaa	Hands down, sure fire, no doubt. He has the  's and lets not forget, it is the Hall Of "FAME" Chipper is the most noticable player in this ERA.

Anyone says Chipper told him so should suffer the same in hell for all eternity.    Anyway, once he got his 500th HR in the pocket. He will be first ballot.|`|AA11605300	Yeah. Just compare him historically to others at his position.|`|yJ8DqPA0aa	Thats a fact and a shoe in.|`|NdTy3twjaa	He's a lock, even as a NY Mets fan I know this.  He is one of the best switch hitters to ever play the game.|`|dsW9j8ZFaa	without a doubt. one of the best offensive 3rd basemen ever.|`|5Iq77gujaa	yeah i think so.  he's an awesome player.  :]|`|TYVltdGxaa	no he used steroids. (he told me himself). He's my dad so stop talking about him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|wApoUG2baa	As a Mets fan, I would agree, as I have seen a lot of his great games.  **bangs head against the wall**    Even though he hasn't been tied to steroid allegations, his injuries probably keep him out on the first ballot but he will eventually get in.  My guess would be after six years on the ballot.|`|AA11808177	He should be hands down the man is a pure baseball player!!  Plays for the love of the game and nothing else, alot of good demeanor from him much like ripken, yount, just to name a few.|`|ZatADRPXaa	Probably not first ballot because he was never the best at anything, but he's had very good stats for a long time, and will probably get a bonus for staying with Atlanta his whole career (assuming he does), and for all of the division titles.      He'll be in, probably within 5 tries, but not the first    Actually on second thought, he has been one of the best switch hitters in history... first ballot could happen.|`|qEbzWH0uaa	I think he is.  He helped the Braves for most of the years they were making the playoffs.  He wasn't there at the very beginning, but he was there most of the way.  He won an MVP award, and he's been one of the most consistent players in baseball.  To those of you who say that he'll get in there only in his hitting, that's a bunch of bull.  Chipper may not have a Gold Glove, but he's been just as consistent in the field as he has been at the plate.|`|b737c34b13c7c1e591c03a8665d3e3fdaa	Yes. If he doesn't make it on the first ballot, he will make it not too long after that
qThmcR1Aaa	The Lions were competitive in a lot of their games this year. There have been a lot of teams worse than them, even some 1-15 teams. The '89 Cowboys were absolutely miserable, for one.    Apropos for the Super Bowl this year, a lot of football historians consider Card-Pitt to be the worst team in NFL history. The Steelers and Cardinals merged in 1944, because of wartime roster shortages, and they got blown out of the water all season long. They earned the derisive nickname of the Carpets, because other teams walked all over them.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card-Pitt|`|6KZgeq3Maa	I will always think that a team that could not win one game will always be worse than a team that did win one.|`|JURTQAfgaa	The '76 buccaneers because the 0-16 lions would have killed them and it was because it was their first year in the league and they had to pick from old players and undrafted rookies.|`|PMluTf72aa	in my opinion, the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers were and are  the worst team ever assembled.  they went 0-14.  however, they have an excuse to go winless as they were an expansion team just starting out, Detroit has been around for a while.|`|AA11154942	the difference one team won the other did not:      Detriot or Yuckaneers (0-14)|`|ybt605Qfaa	The Packers.|`|2wpPrmibaa	its ok, too miami dolphins 2008 i win 15 looses|`|36u3Ml0kaa	Detroit was worse.  Statistically, as well as there own fans hating them and stop going to games.|`|ENBhz7Asaa	I think the 2 worst teams of all time were the win-less '76 Tamba Bay Bucs, and the 1989 Dallas Cowboys.  TB was horrible for 2 years actually, but they did finally win a game in '77.  Dallas finished 1-15 but were horrible.  Jimmy Johnson's first year, Troy Aikman's first year, as an avid Cowboys fan, it was painful to watch, but not nearly as painful for me as it was Aikman.  He got a finger on his throwing hand broken, and was knocked unconscious at least twice and maybe 3 times during that season.  Dallas was so bad, that Johnson said in his book that his last Miami Hurricane team could have beaten them because they had more team speed.  I think detroit probably finishes third in this.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	1976 Buccaneers (0-14) They were shut out 5 times, lost by an average of 20 points/game. Outscored 412-125 for the season. 7 total touchdowns thrown. The coach ignored his team several times out of disgust. Though not old enough to have watched it, I've heard all about the Bucs debut into the NFL-and people laugh about it.    Lions, however come in a very, very close second. At least the Bucs were new to the game, Lions have been losing forever.    Funny fact: After a Tampa Bay loss the coach was asked about the team's execution. His response, "I'm all for it"|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	The Lions were worse and it's not close.    Sure Dan Orlovsky (or Culpepper/Kitna/Stanton) was better than Leaf, but San Diego had a decent defense ranked 13th overall. They were 29th in points allowed (still not the worst) because of all the turnovers comitted by Leaf.    The Lions defense was one of the worst I've ever seen, they allowed 172.1 rushing yards per game, with the Chargers defense they would have won 3, maybe 4 games. The 2000 Chargers with the Lions 2008 defense would have gone 0-16.|`|2HXq1569aa	Lions. This isn't just one season for them. They have been this bad as long as I can remember.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	2008 Detroit Lions.  My best friend has given up his season tickets.  The Teams owners won't spend the money to get quality players.  Expect the team to be sold and moved out of Detroit.|`|kFuCqQIWaa	Lions. The Chargers went to the superbowl against the 49ers if my memory comes correct. I have never been alive to see the Lions do much of anything.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Neither-- It is the 1976 Bucs! Yes they were an expansion team. But even by expansion standards they were poorly put together.
JD5NQxeNaa	Not even close. In the 90's there were more 50 win teams than there are today and there were numerous times, numerous teams won 60+ games in the same season. For example, virtually every year besides the 72 win season the Bulls were 2,3,4th seeds behind teams, like the Knicks, Heat, and Pacers. Competition was stronger than and in the West it was Utah, Houston, Seattle they won 60 a piece and in the East 3 teams won either 60 a piece or close to it.    Back then the defense was great they had great dual defenders that can guard the 1 to the 5. It was harder to score. Virtually, every championship contender were defensive juggernauts with the only exception the Indiana Pacers - whom were the D'Antoni Suns of the 90's.    Defense today is terrible man to man defense is virtually done. Not to many great man to man or on the ball defenders. Everything is help defense today and even that is not great. There are only 3-4 great defensive teams now. Everyone else falls in the average to abysmal in defense. The only defense that has improved now from when Jordan played is perimeter defense. But, it was harder to defend the 3 in the 90's cause there were better perimeter shooters back then than now, so really its not as if perimeter defense has really improved.|`|zRoDeilLaa	Don't you mean PIPPEN'S Bulls?      Jordan's Bulls did nothing but LOSE in the 1980's (till Pippen came along and took over leadership). LMAO!!|`|wXxJUnLJaa	In some ways it is.  In Jordan's era, they didn't have a defensive 3 second rule.  So I guess it was kinda harder to score.  Although MJ always made it look easy.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	NO    th 90s era was the TOUGHEST era!|`|eF60R7DPaa	more harder???|`|IvW7wKXjaa	I think the best measure of this is a team like the Rockets who could not win until Jordan took those couple seasons off. That Rockets team was nasty, among the many other teams that were then.|`|FTYJbQaDaa	yea

The NFL is very unpredictable, so there's no telling who will be in the Super Bowl. Teams can turn around just like that. For all you know the Browns and Lions could be in the Super Bowl. You never know.      Really? I didn't know that...  I was just saying anyone who puts their answer on here is only thinking that certain teams will be in the Super Bowl, because they like the team.

lgMTSoAtaa	It feels like WWE just doesn't care about ECW. They only get the "leftovers" and it's a shame really. I would like to see them give ECW a different style perhaps than RAW and SD. Maybe a little darker, grittier, and more hardcore! Also they should keep it less wacky, (no hornswoggles, khali kiss cams, etc). That may not only help revive it IMO, but also give it a bit of a different edge from RAW and SD.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	Honestly, I think it will be shut down in about a year. It's just not as good as Raw or SmackDown. Vince should learn that sometimes less is more, and quality over quantity.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	The company gets the slot for virtually nothing, so it will remain a distant third in brand name and a dumping ground for talent that have contracts, but little to no future in getting story lines in Smackdown or RAW. It is a Class AAA affiliate to the major product.|`|GKJV2EBSaa	I think ECW needs RVD.He would definitely up the ratings and it would be great to see him back in action.|`|bBHlGs5waa	Yeah, ECW sucks. It could be alot better. They only have about 10 superstars and you actually only see a few of them wrestle. I feel the future of it as a brand is dim.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	It's a show used to develop talent that can be transferred to Raw and Smackdown. It is also used to carry over and further storylines from Raw and Smackdown. It also provides another hour for wrestlers and divas to do matches, cut promos and do interviews. It appears this is the purpose World Wrestling Entertainment has for this program and it serves precisely that purpose.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Nothing. It will just continue to be the third string brand of WWE.|`|BhxycGViaa	i really wish  ECW would go back to the way it used to be this sucks i loved the old ecw this is all vince its nothing like the old ecw  bring back all the old ecw stars the ones that are still with us|`|BMDPdkdraa	now when matt moved to SD to a storyline with jeff ECW is lamer than ever, still im not sure what will be the future, maybe some day vince will want to make ECW like the other brands (raw SD) so it depend on what vince wants|`|DPcIjHHZaa	When Hornswoogle is the most   "Extreme" wrestler then you know there something wrong with ecw what to the old hardcored day|`|TWQNYhVVaa	RVD coming back would do wonders..|`|xnhBucrjaa	the only good people ecw ever had had are gone. like the big show retired and came back to smack down. kurt angle went to tna. bobby lashley got   drafted to raw and then disappeared and wasn't kane on ecw before to? they can't keep anyone good on their.
OfNTLq3Qaa	It still does not even come close to the fiasco at the end of Raw.|`|3I6YUfg0aa	haha, i just watched it back, and yes! now you have told me, it is really noticeable.    Thanks =]|`|8Im1iGFTaa	haha ya that was funny how he got all pissed off at the ref|`|3m9DQuDRaa	The problem wasn't Orton...  It was the WWE wanting a "Better Angle" on the shot.  The cue was supposed to be the point, and Orton assumed that he'd point while in the ring, to get the ropes in the shot...  even the camera man thought that, aiming the camera at both Orton and the Wrestlemania star...  but in the end whomever was the director of video for the night wanted the turnbuckle and gave that as the cue for the pyro...  and probably forgot to tell Orton.    I hate "mis-cue" situations at live shows, because it just proves that things are rigged.  You're supposed to have a suspension of disbelief...  like why is it that pyros go off anyway?  And why does music start before people come out for promos?  Why does music interrupt other promos if no one knew they were going to interrupt?  Instead of asking those questions, we're supposed to just be like "look at the power that guy holds!"  Then flubs on the parts of the backstage happen, and that kills the whole ordeal.    My favorite one was about six years ago when Mark Henry was coming to the ring and Maven's music hit...  do you know why that happened?  Because Maven was the name under Mark Henry in the computer, and someone double clicked incorrectly.    So stupid.|`|XulcYwOnaa	no, but did anyone hear some yell at Orton that he has herpies on RAW the next night? haha it was great!|`|5fQH1V44aa	oh..i didnt notice that! wow! thank you for telling me!|`|7Hsvjp5Jaa	No !!!

Football is really only popular in the states... the NFL has been trying to find a way to spread for years and really hasn't made any progress. Though they are starting to play yearly games in Canada and Europe to try to gather some interest. The other sports have the olympics to get the world's attention while football is on it's own.     Hockey is very popular in Canada, Europe and Russia as well as the United States. Thus the wide mix of Europeans, Canadians and Americans.     Baseball is very popular in the Americas... ranging from North to South. Including all the island nations in-between. It is also popular in East Asia with China, Japan and several other countries in the area showing interest.     Basketball is also gaining popularity. Though it is most popular in the United States... several European countries and Asian countries (mainly China) have pro-leagues. And everyone wants to be in the NBA, so once they've proven themselves in their countries league, they don't hesitate to jump at any oppertunity to join the NBA. The same goes for MLB and the NHL.     So really, it's just a popularity issue... football is really only popular in the United States... naturally it is only going to have American athletes.|`|RL3EVSW2aa	they all get scared when they hear it's long BOMB|`|VvU76vJxaa	American football just isn't very popular abroad so many foreign kids never learn the sport.|`|gBMSx1Jgaa	cuz only americans love football...    im one of the exception though, im not an american but i love football, i love all sports...    with the NFL, i love to see em give each other compound fractures, concussion and tear their acl's off...|`|Wz2lTWJ3aa	The way to become an NFL player is to be recruited from college (with very few exceptions). And the way to become a college footbal player is to be recruited from a high school (with very few exceptions).

I have the movie, but still am unsure about which scene your referencing. But I can answer your other questions.     The fact that the combined weight of the men is over 1,000lbs. does not mean that Foxx had that much weight on top of him. I'm sure the "stack" wasn't perfect and therefore the legs and arms of the men were probably on the ground while they were laying on top of Foxx. A leg of a 300lb. man could easily be 50-70lbs... That combined with the fact that each man was probably supporting a little of their own weight with their arms would take quite a bit of the burden off of Foxx.     That said Foxx still probably felt any where from 500-700lbs. on top of him. This wouldn't hurt so much as take his breath away... the padding is designed to resist pressure, so I doubt Foxx got hurt in any way. Plus they were all professionals... they had several former and current NFL players in that movie and I'm sure they had several informants.

WrDGhduxaa	When the NCAA stopped allowing student athletes to work it put many into an impossible situation.  the school provides tuition, books, and room and board, to most major sport athletes, but not to minor or non revenue sports.  If you are going to school on a track scholarship and receive a half ride you can not work for spending money or to help with your expenses, so unless your family can support you, you can not afford to attend school.  At major D-l schools the football program supports and finances all of the non revenue sports.  They have the money to support the athletes, but spend it on other things, and not teacher salaries or books either.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	If I had my way, there wouldn't even BE athletics in college.

But I just feel its unfair to the people who go there for what college is actually meant for EDUCATION and have to pay for all of it when some people dont care about education and go there for free.|`|YnWrmVd1aa	Where would the money come from?  University systems are already cash strapped and charging outrageous tuition's.  They are already getting a scholarship that pays their tuition so that is already significant.  The ones that turn pro are going to be instantly wealthy.  There is no reason to pay them a salary while in college.  Athletics absolutely deserves to be a part of the university system for the same reasons that they are part of high school.
KW6tdMgKaa	Go to your local golf shop, most shops have equipment to analyze your swing speed, with that information they can suggest a shaft for you. Now for the grip get something that feels comfortable for you, maybe try a mid size grip like a winn xi7, they have a reel good feel to them.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	I would say to see a fitter and get your specs.  Just because your "profile"(hypothetically) says to get jumbo grips and an S-flex shaft doesn't mean that's necessarily true.  A fitter can see little nuances in your swing or grip, and can give you the best possible means to make a good swing.  Maybe you'll change everything, maybe you won't change a thing.  But it'll definitely help you one way or the other.    Don't worry, however, because the driver is the least forgiving club of almost everybody.  It isn't just you ^_^|`|wYGeg0QRaa	Skater a small grip has a tendency to make your hands active in the swing and promotes a closed club face at impact. Playing with a shaft that is too weak will also lead to inconsistent contact with the ball. Try using a stiffer shaft and a standard grip size to help with your problem.

wXxJUnLJaa	I would have to take Ray Allen for sure.  Although Nowitzki is taller and has a higher release than Ray Allen, Ray Allen has a quicker release, & is faster to get open.  Also deadly from that corner spot.|`|y8qGjcZyaa	Ray Allen- Quicker and more agile than Nowitzki|`|VJ1Gsr0Xaa	Dirk. clutch.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	i have to disagree with filip,  ray has been chosen as one of the leagues best and pure three point shooters in the history of the league.  nowitski is a great shooter but he is not as good as ray when it comes to shooting especially from them corners spots.   if either of them were open i would go wit ray but if someone was in their face i would go with dirk. he has a higher chance of making those lucky shots he makes with someone in his face and his length helps.|`|TYVltdGxaa	dirk duh!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|v9hxcvkfaa	It would depend on the situation ...    If it's a designed play out of the inbound, I'd go with Ray Allen    If it's a game on the line, just happen to have the ball in hand, it's Dirk Nowitzki    Ray Allen is a great shooter, but he's also greatly streaky (last year's playoff drought from behind the arc, anyone?), if he hasn't been in a rythym and he just takes the shot b/c he has the ball, I wouldn't bet it all on him.    Dirk's actually a go to guy so to speak so I can see him just end up with the ball at the end of the game.|`|ZMvnaVvCaa	Ray Allen by far.. Dirk isnt as consistent as Allen and even with a man in his face hell drain it. Allen and House are lighting it up from three land these past few games|`|2obPKDr0aa	thts some wat of a tough 1 i would have to say ray allen cuz wen he played for tha sonics he broke a 3pt record,and he has the quickest shot in tha nba.    so i would hav to say ray.|`|Zw3x6aL9aa	ray allen, hands down point blank period.|`|Hvhynlftaa	Ray allen for sure.    Been on the Celtics for only 1 1/2 season and made like 20 buzzer beaters already.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	DIRK NOWITZKI  He can be clutch but i agree with brother J,  Corners more hot spots for Allen,but the rest positions from the wings and the other one are for Nowitzki,more hotter spots for him.But because Dirk Nowitzki is better shooter than Ray Allen so i would say he will take it.  Nowitzki is better than Allen is shooting for little,it's true that Ray has quicker release but Nowitzki's higher release is better and Ray shots quicks and that jumper doesn't go anytime but Nowitzki's higher release is better and can go in more.    Albi i disagree with you too,Nowitzki is one of the best shooters in NBA history so as Allen,but if you're looking over shooting from anyware for three and two it's Nowitzki.But i agree with you only for one thing,corner better spot for Allen.  When from these two guys have a hand in their face Nowitzki is better and he has to be guard for that,no mather wide opne,under presure,clutch or with a hand in his face Nowitzki will hit it.|`|3eI8jxqraa	ray allen|`|4DcvpQXfaa	RAY RAY!    he's more clutch than dirk!    BTW,corner is HOT SPOT for allen!
YnWrmVd1aa	Sure, sounds great.  I'm surprised that they don't have this already.  Who cares if there are more teams and players.  Most people are going to focus on the top few conferences anyway.

YlGjkF4gaa	Well most F1 drivers started at a very very very young age.   They started with karting won everything possible to win in karting then went to the next category like Formula A world series etc. then to Formula 3000 or Formel renault or Formula bmw and some went to GP2 after that. And then some but not a lot make to Formula 1. I mean there are 20 formula 1 drivers and 1000 of people are trying. So it's hard work, discipline, talent !! and some luck.     Formula 1 drivers start gettting sponsored at the age of 10 in these days because karting is is already really expensive, more expensive then most other sports and then think of how much the other categorys cost, that's why they get help from development teams from mclaren/bmw etc and if you aint the talent there looking for, they won't even try you.    So if your not 3 years old and already starting to drive karts or your not a billionaire with the best contacts in the buisness. I'm really sorry but, then it's bad luck for you.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Try to contact Narain Kartikheyan, who raced in F1 in 2005.|`|DY8YYluqaa	You would have had to start with Karting from the age of about 11...

Then if a driver has shown potential they may get a drive for formula one.    But.. it is likely you have missed your chance.|`|kJcCNie0aa	you would have to go through a lot of training and work your way up, start with races that have a small entry fee, once you gain some money, get professional training, it would probably take 3-5 years before you can get into formula 1...

But in high school if I had to guess maybe 5'11 - 6'3    185 - 220 pounds. But you arnt playing on varsity you're playing on a freshman football team so maybe size wont matter too much. But dont worry about size just play where you want to. Body fat percentage I'd guess about anywhere from 5% - 12%.

utaxvtZZaa	You won't go to jail dude. You'll just get some fine and have to go to court. Avoid the players though - you might be fair game (if they're willing to touch a naked man). Some guy did it at Ohio State when I was there. Everyone cheered and it was awesome. He did a pretty good job of running around out there with people chasing him - it took them a while to capture him. The players were cracking up watching him go. The crowd went totally nuts then bood the security guys when they hauled him to the sideline.    Look at it this way. If you can afford it, make sure your friends have a video camera and that will DEFINATELY be something you can always look back on and laugh about. It'll be a hit every year at your Super Bowl party.    Also, don't listen to the people who say you're a loser, or a$$ for disrupting the game. Believe me, when I saw it, the stadium went nuts. No one was complaining - it was hilarious.    If you want to minimize the fine, I'd say do it at some high school game close to where you live (so court is easier) but where no one knows you. And as part of the bet, your buddy pays the fine and gives you whatever else you need to do it. Go for it dude, seriously, if you got the guts you have to do it.|`|rgA2o9c0aa	Indecent Exposure.

(had to add something funny)... but seriously, you have to remember the times we are in.     It really all depends on how light-humored the officer is who is dealing with your case. If the officer is in a good mood, you could get away with a fine and a slap on the wrist... and would most likely have to register as a sex offender (which you don't want), if the officer is in a bad mood, they could throw the book at you... which could easily include jail time, community service, fines and more. I would highly recommend not doing this... especially at a nationally televised game... if it is televised at all, you also have to worry about the network coming after you... as well as the sports league in which you plagued with your naked a-s-s.     To keep your word on the bet... try streaking through a highschool half-time show or something... avoid the national spot light. Just my advice.|`|VvYNeqcIaa	Yea I'd say a fine for sure.

Thats what Mixed Martial Arts is-the combination of different martial arts.  If you train hard enough and eat right losing the weight shouldn't be too difficult.  Good luck.|`|vOOf7xdEaa	dont know sorry|`|MekHMnAkaa	First of all you have a good start with 3 years of boxing, but if your getting into it just because a friend wants you too you should probably stick to boxing. Learning sevaral fight disciplines takes a lot of dedication and willingness to get beaten up in the ground game for a while. But as in any other realm in life hard work and dedication will take you as far as your willing to go.

c5menwRwaa	All depends on what you are training for, if you are training for real combat then train as you will be when it happens - no wraps, unless you are boxing, then train with wraps and gloves.    Any protective equipment will impede the conditioning of the area it covers.    Protective equipment is by no means necessary, people have been training for thousands of years without all that stuff.    Train to meet your requirements and goals.|`|CQo3Y0Jmaa	Yes if your fighting in the ring or such but other than that why would you need them except in a match or training?|`|IFGYXPDbaa	If you want to hit a heavy bag or spar against an opponent, you must wear hand wraps.    Be safe, not sorry.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	what are you conditioning your knuckles for there ninja?|`|vOOf7xdEaa	if you dont want to break your wrist or fingers|`|vt2VS0lDaa	If you want to be a burrito.|`|kH4LeoAAaa	Yes, It is a must if training punching.    A hand wrap is a strip of cloth used by boxers (and participants in other combat sports) to protect the hand and wrist against injuries induced by punching. It is wrapped securely around the wrist, the palm, and the base of the thumb, where it serves to both maintain the alignment of the joints, and to compress and lend strength to the soft tissues of the hand during the impact of a punch.    A hand wrap protects against several common types of injuries that are familiar to most boxers. For instance, it supports the wrist joint, keeping it aligned when the impact of a punch is absorbed by the wrong part of the hand. It also secures the base of the thumb to the hand, thereby reducing the chance of a sprain or fracture that can result from the thumb striking an opponent's elbow. Most importantly, it significantly strengthens the metacarpus, reducing the likelihood of a fracture of one of the metacarpal bones. Such a fracture is often called the "boxer's break" -- which is usually a fracture in the neck of the fifth metacarpal -- because of its ubiquity among fighters.    Hand and wrist wraps are used to compress (and keep compressed when hitting) the bones and tissues in the hand. The claim is that such compression allows boxers to hit with greater force than if they did not use them. Boxers claim they feel less pain when hitting so their opponent may feel more pain.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Not necessary, but will help prevent injury.|`|25xZMjmTaa	absolutely. My instructor nearly broke his hand without wraps, and w.o. them long term damage can occur|`|vll1ynAgaa	If you are boxing then it would be a smart thing but for karate they aren't needed unless your practicing breaking wood.
jvRZfkvRaa	it all depends on why you are building stamina.  knowing that would help give better answers     In genral.  running, swimming and anything thing that has to do with raising your heat beat and keeping it there an extended amount of time is going to help build stamina    as a martial artist I would highly suggest a martial arts class|`|GCsMUrQbaa	I was watching a show on HBO a couple weeks ago and the chick said that if you flex your penis like when you want to stop peeing and keep it flexed for ten seconds and do this randomly throughout the day that you will gradually gain stamina.|`|IgivEx1Vaa	Answer no 2 is absolutely bull***t .

ec75e725937fc92000f2745410651420aa	How dare Arsenal draw with Everton you mean... you didn't take the lead we did. It was 1-0 to Everton until the 93rd Minute...    I don't think Wenger will moan about it... he'll leave the whinging to AF and RB... funny though... anyone who has a niggle at teh Spanish Waiter is okay by me... ; )    It bugs me when managers moan about tactics played by the opposition...    lets see...    I know that manure nited play a great counter attack and direct passing style... so I'll let them do that just in case they moan afterwards... get a grip...    Managers who moan about the tactics of the opposition don't have enough tactical knowledge to change their team around to compensate.    Everton have a very small squad, and the majority of our attacking minded players are injured... so I guess we have to change the tactics that suit US... not YOU... its seems that the Redsh*te and Manure don't agree with this.|`|u9k4Orvpaa	RVP scored a world class goal to save your skins... just think what everton could achive with a couple of fit class strikers ...|`|yulika3laa	He has realized how silly he looked whenever he rants by just looking at Rafa.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	How does it feel?

Wenger needs a course of sour grapes, quick.|`|AA12352139	Sadly, Arsenal has lost it's cutting edge. Teams no longer fear the gooners. Arsene should concentrate on his own team and stop moaning about the opposition's tactics. Build the defence up and stop trying to 'walk into the net'.     Arsenal should also be wary of the 'lower' teams. If they can beat Chelski, ManU and the Reds, they should not be losing to Hull and dropping points against Everton!

No, their season is not over.|`|ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	Its over for Arsenal. They had a good team last season, the one the manager had been pleading for patience with. But he dismantled the midfield, letting go of Hleb and Flamini. He replaced Hleb with Nasri (good) but did not replace Flamini who is warming the AC Milan bench. So in essence he took the club backwards instead of forwards, and their league position reflects this. If Arsenal drop out the top four, the axe will fall on Wenger.

But we have an important game on Sunday (against Chelsea) and if we play like we played in the first half we can beat anyone."      ahahaha if the first half was great enough to defeat anybody why was there only one goal???? Anyways I thought he knew games were won after 90mins and not 45 after commanding Captain Flailtastic to fall in the box after 80mins to get the winning penalty so much.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Oh it's Wigan's fault , " because they  tackle and keep running" ? - I think that was the wrong thing to say .|`|7x4VtGtFaa	Rafa is clutching on straws. He is blaming everyone but himself. He is clearly distracted. The players are demoralised. And the club under speculation is not helping either.    I can see Fergie, holding Rafa's behind and saying "Squeaky BUM time"!
Z0IKiIJ4aa	No  Shevchenko left a winning team to go to another winning team (at the time lol)    Keane left ...(i cant even say the team's name) and went to L.  (gawd, i cant even say that name. geez)    Brings new meaning to the phrase  Going from bad to........ dR bad!|`|JCRdicqXaa	Good point.  But any other comparison between them is academic as, once, Shevchenko was considered a World Class player but Robbie has and never will be considered one.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	I guess you're right.    I hope the rumors are true and Keane goes back to Spurs.|`|peFtORvUaa	28million for ferdinand?i'm sorry but that much money for an average defender?|`|tfotPdeZaa	hey! leave sheva alone.|`|AA12352139	Spot on! Robbie is still a good striker - best bet for him is to stick his tail btw his legs and go back to Spurs or moaning Rafa will ruin his career. Harry would welcome him with open arms anyway.|`|roALMIXOaa	mmhmm i see wer ur cummin from|`|gPsFFQbRaa	MABE|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	wtf kinda question is that to ask?|`|BAlXgworaa	Is Wayne Rooney a Granny Shagger in Seedy Brothels?|`|4ecd94d350b85a878a8087e8d7d214d4aa	Robbie KEANE is not a player for big teams...   but , Liverpool didn't use to buy first class strikers : Ciss , Crouch, Morientes, Belamy & others .. Torres is the only exception ! so y to blame Keane  , blame Liver's ambitions this season !|`|Ix0M7mpgaa	You've gotta give the guy a chance and play him consistantly and in his preferred position.    Berbatov hasn't exactly set the world alight with his UTD performances so far but he has been playing constantly and is slowly getting better and better.    Very few players come straight into a new team and produce outstanding performances immediately ala Torres and Rooney.|`|7x4VtGtFaa	Oh dear, I was just thinking about that. I mean, Chelsea is reportedly being sold by Abramovich. So if someone buys Chelsea, he can try to buy Liverpool. And yeah, he can try to bring Shevchenko back to the premiership. LOL.|`|huto12P3aa	Yep he is
IgivEx1Vaa	Yes I wanted to see a five set match. Atleast a four set would have done.  But that was not the case as Federer loves to lose against me. So I'll Defeat him on Sunday.|`|gBMSx1Jgaa	kinda expected that to happen, actually almost everybody expected another drubbing..     with the current weapons that roddick has now, there is no way he can beat federer...|`|VefSnu0Gaa	well, more like sad......cause i really thought andy could do it this time.-  but federer played amazing, and deserved to win.-|`|Vbmq0lupaa	I beg to differ actually. I thought it was a pretty high quality match -- Andy played his best, so did Roger. The reason why Roger beat him in straight today is because he knows Andy's game inside out and Andy is a good match-up for him. He can read Andy's serve, be aggressive, attack his second serve, and boss him around the baseline and construct a point to finally set up a winner. Which is why their head-to-head is 16-2 in Roger's favour.    Andy did play well -- Roger just played better, and knows exactly how to tackle Andy's game. I mean, Roger hit 16 aces and 51 winners; how can this not be a high quality match? Andy's stats were pretty good too.|`|X0xwZTebaa	The court was too slow so roddick had to lose!!|`|Z8egbefvaa	Yes I was.  But Andy has had some great results this tournament.  That not only means match wins either.  It has been so long since I've seen him move that way on a court and hit shots like that in such an attacking style.  For years I've watched him play feet behind the baseline on all types of court surfaces getting beat by players that shouldn't be able to hold their own against him.  That match vs. Novak is the reason why I am a fan of Andy and his tennis.|`|ClQ9yJweaa	Not at all. Went as expected. Roddick was lucky to just get there, and cant beat Federer, and continually goes over rated, and a top 10-15 player at best. All Roddick has is a serve, unfortunately and a pretty decent forehand, but you cant consistently slice backhands and not play net well in order to win. He has never really possessed a topspin backhand and has hurt him through all these years. Plays all too defensively, too often with that slice, and his serve can only get him so far. What is he 2-14 against Fed?. Says enough doesnt it?|`|ppoD3p2Saa	not really, i knew federer would beat him weather roddick played good or not.....federer just a better over all player...sry|`|by7BQ2npaa	This was just going to be another routine match for Federer.  This isn't 2003.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes i would have loved seeing 5 setter , roddick forehand was not working|`|3jBUJxOdaa	not at all. roddick lost to the brilliance of federer..so i don't see anything to be upset about it..a brilliant performance usually does not result in a long match, but a great match nonetheless|`|U7BkuEU9aa	While I never believed Andy would be able to take more than a set from Fed, I did expect the game to be much closer...sure, he did play better after the first set, but it ended up having the same result as the Rafa-Simon match!|`|e7B8WkkIaa	Not at all. The TV wonks try to make you think that Roddick has some sort of fitness advantage.   No one has an advantage over Federer in anything. Nadal is the only guy who can compete with Federer right now. Roddick had a great tournament. He wins the ones he should win and loses the ones he should lose.   It usually plays out in tennis.|`|AA12050428	Just what I expected!.  Brilliant!|`|6of3tqHhaa	yes, I really wanted Roddick to win too!  I thought he would have the potential to beat Roger|`|iD3XXaMOaa	Not really. I am a Federer fan & I will take a comprehensive straight sets victory any day over a gruelling 5 setter. Dont get me wrong mate. I am a huge Roddick fan and I support him against every other player except Fedex.    Roddick has been simply playing brilliantly throughout the Australian Open. He really did try his best today but Fedex was too good again today. He hit 51 winners today. Its hard to counter the man when he is hitting aces and winners at will like this. After that 5 setter match, Federer looks in magical touch. He toyed with Del Potro and Roddick. Roddick did his best & I dont think he could have done more. Another day, he could have beaten Fedex with the kind of form he has been in but Roger was not to be denied today.|`|WwZpEFg5aa	very disappointed indeed, but lets wait till the finals with NADAL ;-}|`|rHz1RyWiaa	I was disappointed that Andy didn't win the match, but I wasn't surprised.  I would love to see him win a few more grand slam events before he is done.  Federer looks like he is back to his old self and it will be hard for anyone to beat him.  It looks like it will be another Nadal-Federer final which is fitting because they are the top two players in the world right now.  I am just glad that Andy beat Djokovic.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	I wish it could be a much closer match-up. But I must say the quality of play is not bad. I'm not very disappointed. Federer has just mastered the game of Roddick. He has got used to it. Unluckily, the great improvement in silence from Roddick still is insufficient to outdo the smart-playing Federer. I hope a stronger Roddick in the coming tournaments will appear. I look forward to the men's and women's final!  ~I'm saddened instead by Dementieva's not being able to be the champion this time~|`|NPioEHKWaa	No not really  Almost everytime Fed plays Roddick he takes his serve apart.. When you take Roddicks serve away you're left with a pretty average player. Although he has been getting more confident with his forehand but not good enough to beat Fed I'm afraid.|`|2m1hbw2iaa	People like to talk themselves into thinking Roddick could've edged out a close 5-set victory over Fed, saying things like "Oh, Roddick's in top form" or "Fed's too vulnerable nowadays."  And here we see a decisive 6-2, 7-5, 7-5 crushing victory (and the 16th notch in Fed's 'Andy Racket')    The fact is that we're still in the midst of a tennis era dominated by Fed / Rafa.  I almost convinced myself to stay up and watch this match, then realized I was being foolish.    Wanna see a close, epic match?  Stick to the classic showdown of the Titans:  Nadal and Federer.  There are still plenty of epic showdowns left for the tennis fans to enjoy.|`|m2E4rLxgaa	Does Roddick have any game besides a fast serve? I don't think so--and you shouldn't either.|`|j5fNBBi9aa	It was a good match....one of the best 3 setters youll ever see.....Federer had some great shot making and Roddick had his moments too.....Roddick is helpless against Federer.....look at the differentials Roddick was like +20 and Federer was like plus 35 somethin like that.....it was good tennis....just quick tennis....both guys play fast....but it wasnt a bad match at all
vqm10k3Jaa	you might want to have someone check that little click in your shoulder. Either that or use lighter weights if your being too heavy, I don't use that particular exercises but it appears to but lots of pressure of the shoulder at that angle.    I have a deformity as well, think called funnel chest.  It's only slight but it's easily noticed and thankfully it doesn't restrict my lungs or heart so I got lucky.  Getting a bigger would take time, and you would have to focus alot on the chest, shoulders, and back muscles.  But if your training MAs be careful not to overtrain yourself with too much resistance, such as if you punch heavy bag, your shoulders will be getting plenty of work.    Find a good coach.    (this is my best answer, take for whats worth.)  Hope you get answered by some of the more knowledgeable people on here.
sBdOzbx5aa	I've sat everywhere from a sky box with all you can eat food and beer, to behind the dug out,  but the best is behind the plate especially when there is a really good pitcher on the mound because you really get a feel of what the hitter is going through as far as the movement and speed of the pitches.  So first is behind the plate,  then behind the dugout or  any where in the infield is pretty  good,  then sky box, then second level behind the plate or infield,  I only go to the bleachers as a last resort.  I had to sit in the bleachers when I was a kid and I would rather just watch on TV.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	If I could sit anywhere, in any park~ It would be right next to one of the dugouts. (Are those seats ever available or season tix only?) You get a chance to hear what the players and coaches are saying, and maybe even snag an autograph before or after the game.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	first base line seats are the best|`|ytNlz3b7aa	The dugout is a pretty cool place to watch a game. See if you can get a contract.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	When I go to reds games I like being either along the dugouts or in the outfield as close to the wall as I can.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	The best spot is to sit right behind the dugout! If you want to snag homeruns though, just go to any of the outfield seats.|`|ZgBczgIMaa	In the back|`|ZatADRPXaa	I like the front of the second tier up, just beyond first or third base.  Nice unobstructed view of everything, pretty close, but far enough that you can follow everything.

Although Swagger had an awesome one liner.|`|Nzqt4Qu7aa	We learned that Matt Hardy requested to be released from ECW to go to SmackDown. There was a match between The Boogeyman & Ricky Ortiz, Boogeyman won because Ortiz left the ring. Jack Swagger got his title stolen off of him, him and Teddy went to the ring and demanded that whoever took the title come out and give it back to Swagger. Finlay came out saying he knew who took it, Hornswoggle comes out from under the ring with the title. Hornswoggle gives Swagger the title back. Swagger pushes Hornswoggle over & Finlay starts to beat on Swagger.    Oh and there were two other matches: Mark Henry vs. Tommy Dreamer. Mark Henry won. And Finlay vs. Paul Burchill. Finlay won.|`|yKBsB4Dyaa	i don't have time for ecw  i mean i barely watch raw|`|YhfMrppSaa	It was boring.

He says that Matt Hardy has requested his release from ECW and will now be on SmackDown. He then announces that Boogeyman is backstage. Jack Swagger comes out a interrupts him.    * Ricky Ortiz vs. Boogeyman  - Ortiz comes out and tries to give Boogeyman a rally towel. Boogeyman clotheslines him out of the ring and the ref throws out the match before it gets started.    * A Tribute to the Troops video package is shown.    * Jack Swagger is shown backstage. Someone has stolen his championship belt.    * Finlay b. Paul Burchill  - Katie Lea is out with Paul Burchill and Hornswoggle is with Finlay. The match goes back and forth for a while until Hornswoggle distracts Burchill long enough for Finlay to gain the advantage. Finlay gets the win following his Celtic Cross finisher. During the match Hornswoggle chases Katie Lea around ringside.    * Backstage Swagger tries to get Tiffany to help him find the missing ECW Championship belt.    * Jack Swagger then confronts Mark Henry about the belt.    * Mark Henry b. Tommy Dreamer  - Mark Henry misses an elbow drop and slams into the ring. Tommy Dreamer goes to the top rope and jumps off. Henry catches him and hits the Worlds Strongest Slam followed by a pinfall.    Theodore Long, Tiffany, and Jack Swagger head to the ring to get Swaggers ECW title belt back. Theodore Long gets on the mic and calls out whomever stole the title. Finlay makes his way out to ringside. Hornswoggle appears from underneath the ring with the ECW Championship belt. Swagger hits Hornswoggle and Finlay takes him out with a shot to the head to end this weeks ECW.

PaMTtUXbaa	I am not going to Mock your draft.     I like it!|`|rDmlKoRQaa	-Hakeem Nicks will not go that high, and Jeremy Maclin won't go that low. Maclin is projected to be the second wide receiver taken in the draft because of his speed, size, and ability to return kicks. Depending on combine workouts you could even see Kenny Britt taken before Nicks.    -Malcom Jenkins will not be taken top ten in this draft unless he has a phenomenal combine.     - The Packers are more likely to take a defensive end in Orakpo or Brown before they take a defensive tackle. They have spent early draft picks on DTs recently so I doubt they do it again.    - I don't think the Dolphins will draft a WR in the first round. It doesn't match Bill Parcells' philosophy.     - Percy Harvin will not be taken in the first round. He is small and has had a history of injuries. His hybrid RB/WR style doesn't match up with all teams style of play.    Other than those things, your guess is just as good as anybodies. If it was easy or a certainty to pick a mock draft we wouldn't have to tune in to watch it would we?|`|CP2Ahl1baa	that is really good    but i dont think leasean mcoy will go that high and not to the egals they need a power back like sean green who they could get in the second round not another speed back    percy harven will not go that high, he runs the ball a ton and is to small to do that in the NFL, he could have value in a wild cat but jermy maclan is a better prospect,     i dont think marc sanchez has a chance to fall that far    hakkem knicks wouldnt go that high    neither will sedrick marcs    neither will willam moore    i think the lions will get staford but i understand that pick|`|fiaFQAWWaa	LOL- Maclin is way better than Harvin!    Your draft is the worst so far!|`|u7GBP579aa	i not goin 2 comment on everything becuase i know most of the positions not all but there where a few that stood out. number 1 lion will take a quarterback and matt staford has to be the one they will pick there is no way they will pick any other position there. the other one that stood out is chris wells going to the eagles, i dont see that happening i see him going to the bears. even though the bears may need a wideout i think they will solve that problem during free agency|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	I don't think the Jets would pass on Sanchez and Maclin to take Laurinaitis. We don't really need another linebacker, we need a QB of the future and a talented young receiver.    Otherwise that looks excellent though, and I can see you know your stuff. I'm not familiar with some of the names later on, but the top 10 or 15 sound very plausible.    (edit:) p.s. Regarding Nicks I agree with kcbf that he probably shouldn't go that high, but the Jags have made a habit of reaching in the first round, so nobody they pick would surprise me.  As long as Al Davis is running the Raiders, nothing they do would surprise me either.|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	It's good  whenever someone takes the time to share their draft is cool. Now to your draft I doubt Nicks goes that high or Sanchez drops that far, but who knows until after the combine. As for Britt going to the Giants at 29 doubtful since they should be able to get him with the I think 42nd pick If Brian Cushing or Stintim from Virginia are avaliable the Giants take either one.|`|1b056ae753a93a6725c73d5d98237d88aa	If the Raiders draft Percy Harvin I will literally kill someone    Edit:Why the hell a top 10 pick in Brian Orakapo fall all the way to the Falcons who already have a good DE?    Also the Chargers don't need another RB. Also the Bengals will be the ones who will need to add Aaron Curry or maybe even the Browns.

vgt0YtRxaa	, Chargers hire firm to market team in L.A. area     The San Diego Chargers have revealed that they've struck a deal with the Wasserman Media Group to market the franchise in Los Angeles and Orange counties.     There's been a bailout plan in place for years, in case the San Diego city fathers fail to build the Chargers a new stadium somewhere in the Northern Tijuana region.     And Casey Wasserman, who owns the now-dormant Arena Football League's Avengers, has been using his indoor team as a practice wife, so when the day comes for an outdoor football franchise to make up its finicky mind, he'll have an engagement ring ready.     Upon further review, we'd kind of actually welcome the Chargers back, nearly 50 years after they literally bolted. That prodigal son kinda thing, and all.     Wasserman has ties to Roski and AEG, that Tim Leiweke-led group that built Staples Center, Home Depot Center, L.A. Live and had plans at one time for a downtown football stadium until it grew tired of the red tape involved.     No they won't fire AJ and yes the chargers are good as gone in San Diego. AJ in LA|`|rzkFHAEJaa	If they do, they do. I can't stop it. And the imports on the city councel could care less, being from other places.|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	AJ is good at what he does...find and hire new talent.  I didn't like what he said about LT but he did apologize and said he was wrong. BUT that does not change the fact that the guy appears to be getting a little full of himself.  I say its time for a change.  Not saying the Spanos' will do that.  Heck, they let go a future hall of fame coach in Marty because he and AJ didn't get along.  Where I came from that's call "Cutting off ones nose to spit your face".    As far as the Charger's leaving San Diego and moving to LA...I'm certainly hoping not, but if they do, I wouldn't blame them. Professional football is a business. The Spanos' are in it to make money. Until the San Diego City Counsel and other politician get off their backsides and get a stadium built, the Chargers have no other option but to leave. It will be a sad day in San Diego because we'll never ever get another professional football team here. At least we have them for one more year.    GO CHARGERS 2009!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	They should have fired that moron LONG AGO!!    No, they are not moving.|`|GMmmbLGRaa	Phuck San Diego!!..    GO NINERS!    hope this helps..|`|utaxvtZZaa	I'd like to see AJ go - he's just a total beeeatch. Sure sometimes he has good drafts but then he blows player contracts. Look at Brees, man. I don't care if they move or not. I'm a Charger fan but never lived anywhere close to SD. I guess I just grew up liking their uniforms and started following them from there. Fouts, Jefferson, Winslow, those guys - they were cool.
uWYlumvsaa	I did. Andy got hyped up again, and as usual, it backfired on him. Assuming there'll be a Fed/Nadal final, EVERYONE is gonna be tuned in to watch. Either Federer will make history by tying Sampras for No. 14, or Rafa will win his 6th slam and add humiliation, having beat in a GS final on every surface, including his weakest. This should be a fun final and I expect tons of shotmaking. I don't expect this to match the Wimby final, but it could come close.     Both have played tremendous, but Nadal's been better, not having dropped a set. I think he is far more motivated to win his 1st slam on hard courts as opposed to Federer wanting to win No. 14. I'm sure Sampras will be watching, and secretly cheering for Rafa, so his record of 14 slams remains intact. As great as Fed has played as of late, it's no guarantee it'll be enough to beat Nadal. We shall see what happens.    Can't wait for Sunday!!!!|`|NdTy3twjaa	No, I had class in the morning.  Plus I knew Federer  would win anyhow.|`|VefSnu0Gaa	well, my time zone it's different, so it's more like i woke up early.-  dinara's match ended around 5 am, and i got up again at 6:30 to see andy.-|`|USY1XHfbaa	Yes it is 5:30 AM right now, and I have a class at 8:30 so I am just going to tough it out. I hoped the match would have stretched 5 sets but it was still worth it nonetheless. Now all that is on is Mats Wilander and Pat Cash which is pretty painful to watch.|`|3b1KrGHTaa	I slept all afternoon and evening so I can stay up and watch it. The messed up sleep/non-sleep schedule is worth it every time.
b994a4f27ea4a38742bd550caa568bbdaa	good for parker.  your son should mind his own business and not approach guys he doesn't know, especially in strip clubs.  pro athletes out of touch???  your son called to cry to you about a stranger not signing his hat.  who's out of touch?|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	you should tell your son not to go to strip clubs...seriously.|`|0Lg0Pj0Paa	Your son should go fetch his balls.. Who wears a cap to a god damn strip club? Did it have a propeller on it too???|`|7nDpz7vyaa	Murdock, you and your unfornunate encounters! LMAO|`|e5B5ITbhaa	Thats the way players are now. That was rude none the less.|`|AA10896470	I doubt this is true but if it is, here's what gets me: So your son goes to a Steeler, before the Super Bowl, with a hat that has Cardinals colors? Think about that. Also, he throws the cap across the room and your son doesn't kick him in the balls but rather goes and "fetches" it??? Are you sure your son's a man? Screw an autograph, how about your son grow a pair or get a sense of pride for crying out loud!!!! It's guys like him that take BS like this that are the reason why these athletes have such crappy attitudes.|`|ORJ1UNSjaa	This sounds made up. Really, who gloats to their mother about visiting a strip club? That would sure make her proud, excellent job raising your son!|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	i think you're full of crap.  you got about a million members of the national and worldwide media down there, and you know they're ALL looking for some juicy bit, some gossip to be the first to break, so i'm sure they're staking out such "hotspots" like this just waiting for some pacman bullsh*t to happen and get it off to the internet.  willie, and the rest of them, are aware of this, and i'd be surprised if any of them were on anything but their best behavior down there.        you need more evidence to backup your claim.|`|xCquanOeaa	As a pro football player paid millions Parker should act like a Professional when in public if he didn't want to sign the cap that's fine but just because your a pro don't put other people down. I bet if you contacted the Steelers via their website they might find this interesting. If you do this make sure you son has witnesses to back up his story.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I agree with the guy above me.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	haha yea I was in that same room. I was stunned when little Gil went running after the cap.  Absolutely low class move by Parker|`|xGofrX5Iaa	Another reason to hate the steelers.|`|4blCVEvOaa	Clown Murdock is right. Hats can really get in the way when you're doing the motor boat at the strip club.    Your poor boys....they sure go through some rough times. Maybe it's all those soap operas you made them watch growing up. You have to figure that years of 90210 reruns sissified them at least a little. Oh well, you can always rent a hooker on Craig's List and try again....|`|vT4eybSyaa	As a Steeler fan I am embarassed.  I make a point of telling people how classy the players and organization are.  I wish he could have just told your son no, and not embarassed him like that.  If I was your son, I might have started throwing hands as soon as he tossed my hat.  I personally don't care how rich and famous a person is, if they disrespect me like that, I'm handing out an ***-whipping.    And for the record, not all of us Steeler fans are pompous arrogant *******|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	this is the 3rd rumor ive heard. your lame! hahahahahaha.

m2zXOREJaa	Sacked he should be bagged with a name like Henderson a bet he's a muppet,Knighton did'nt get his mitts on United thats a lie as was he not labeled for one game the man in the spotlight lol.This guy rants about old news,i'd send him to the home section of the fans section and witness a game 1st hand as he comes over as a penpusher who possibly has'nt been to a City match in his life.   E.K-i like how the person below says dont read the article,now correct me if i'm wrong so you buy a paper to read to find out whats happening,and that means all of it,so basically if someone says anything about our club then you know there is going to be criticism,it's the nature of the law.|`|u7YIC77Xaa	That article is written in an inflammatory manner but I wouldn't take it to heart. Just don't read that particular paper! Most papers have an editorial stance which is hard to avoid given that all journalists are humans with opinions of their own. Some papers encourage their writers to invoke anger in their reader. Check out Jeremy Clarkson's articles for example!    To address some issues raised in the article:  I don't think Mark Hughes is an 'errand boy'. The article seems to assume that Mark Hughes had nothing to do with the Kaka transfer saga. As if any manager in his right mind would turn down the opportunity to sign Kaka! The journalist even admits Hughes is 'an intelligent' individual. Do you think Mark Hughes would have walked into a job if he thought he wouldn't have control? Of course not! You can definately see Mark Hughes was behind the signing of Bridge and Bellamy. The Sheik wouldn't have chosen those two players himself. They might have paid over the odds for those players but that is simply because every club targeted by City is sticking their hand in for extra cash.|`|GjpWEu6Raa	KNIGHT     SEND IN ANARTICLE OF YOUR UNBIASED OPINIONS AND ASK THE MANAGEMENT TO SEE IF THEY COULD EMPLOY A MORE ARTISTIC WRITER WHO WOULD NOT COME UP WITH SUCH CODS-WALLOP ie YOU..!

afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	If those are your only two choices, go with the shotgun. For home defense the shotgun would be a better home protection choice. As a beginning hunter you'd also want the shotgun overthe .22 pistol. Most of your shots would most likely be with a rabbit on the run rather than a sitting shot and you'd want the wider pattern the shotgun would offer.   With not much experience you'll also want to practice shooting as often as possible until you're comfortable with the shotgun and it becomes second nature to turn the safety off, shoulder it, and fire in a nice smooth motion.   With that being said, I regularly hunt rabbit with .22 pistols and revolvers, and my Ruger 10/22 with a red dot sight. You just need paractice, practice, and more practice.|`|AseJ6Y13aa	Shotgun will kill them much faster and will be easy to hit them with. The 22 does not spread out like the pellets do from the shotgun.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	A 20 ga will be better. It is easier to score a hit and get the desired results on both rabbits and robbers with the shotgun.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	You might what to consider an O/U Combo, with a 20 guage under and a rifle bore on top. There are manufacturers who make a 22/20 Over under..   http://www.survivalprimer.com/PaulsGuns/...  http://www.savagearms.com     Contact a Dealer to see about the 24C Savage.     The advantage of a rifle is the reach out and touch something,  The shotgun is an excellent choice for birds, squirrels or rabbits. Personally the less lead you put in a critter the less you have to pick out when you eat it.  The rifle for small game like rabbits, squirrel is a better choice. Generally you can get a shot as a standing rabbit or squirrel.. Hunting birds is a shotgun sport.     The 20 guage is adequate for self defense. Get buck shot rather then slugs. Keep in might both of these will carry through walls..     If you are considering anything for self defense one of the best weapons is knowledge. Get to a weapons and tactics self defense course in your area, it would be well worth the time and money spent in protecting yourself, your family and belongings.     Don't be a victim. Join the NRA   http://www.nraila.org/Issues/factsheets/...|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	It's next to impossible to hit a running rabbit with a rifle, much less a handgun, but it's lots of fun to hunt with the 22. The big difference is how hungry you are. If you want rabbit for the pot, you'd best stick to the shotgun.|`|nooi0ldjaa	20 gauge would be better for both.|`|TvARYVRJaa	20 gauge pump  for both ,, assume you mean home defense,,,, yes shotgun works all the time|`|zlmnfFpYaa	You probably will actually be able to hit a rabbit with a shotgun.  I'll pretty much guarantee you won't hit a rabbit with a .22 pistol, unless the rabbit is really stupid.    As far as self defense, neither is a great choice.  They are both very light caliber firearms to use in that capacity.  A .32 or .380 handgun is the absolute lowest caliber you should use as a handgun for self defense.  If you need a shotgun for that, no lower than 16 gauge.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Actually you can hunt rabbits with a .22 pistol successfully.  It is challenging, but very do-able if you stalk the rabbits.  Of course, the 20 gauge makes rabbit hunting much easier.  Also, a 20 gauge is a better weapon for home defense than any handgun; it is equivalent to the ballistic force of being hit with two .44 Magnum rounds simultaneously.    If I understand correctly, you want a gun that you can use for both rabbit hunting and self defense.  The 20 gauge shotgun wins hands down in both situations.  Although it can be used for rabbits, the .22 pistol requires pretty good marksmanship and it is too small to use as a reliable self defense tool.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	In my not so humble opinion the Mossberg 500 shotgun in 20 ga is the most versatile choice available for hunting up to deer and down to varmint control. I know there are other manufactures with excellent reputations; however, during my service time in the Coast Guard I used Mossbergs in weather conditions from really bad to unmentionable, and they always preformed well. I like the twenty gauge because of control and recoil characteristics.      Look Here for more information on Mossberg:    http://www.mossberg.com/products/default...    then hit specifications and check out 500 pump action combos. for 20 ga. This gives you a bird, rabbit, field barrel and a rifled barrel for sabot slugs for shooting anything up to deer sized game.     Last you need a secutiry barrel for home defense. look here for one.  http://www.mossberg.com/products/access....    Under 500 barrels the 20 ga slug at 18 1/2 in for home defense.    During officer survival training the FBI told us that the most frightening sound a criminal can hear is the sound of a pump action being cycled.     Please take a NRA sanctioned beginning shotgunning course and if available locally a home defense course.|`|ZA7qM4mvaa	Its easy. a pistol=1 projectile / a shotgun= multiple projectiles I prefer mulitple projectiles being put on target, rabbit or for home defense|`|Y4RS35M7aa	The advantage of the shotgun is that it's so much easier to hit the little b@st@rds with a spread of   5 shot than with that tiny 22 bullet.  The other advantage of the shotgun, for home defense, is that a load of buchshot is much, much more effective than that little 22 bullet against an intruder.      Also, in the case of the pump shotgun, there isn't an intruder in the world who wants to hear the "Rack-Rack" of a shotgun.    Of course, a 22 is certainly better than no gun, if you really need one!
gVYfFSpRaa	You're really an @sshole, you know that?|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Maybe hes a swinger & i thnk little dustins cool sorry tom lol
GdJTQX6raa	No, I don't agree with you. even today this game is unpredictable as ever till the last ball is delivered or the last batsman is out. can we re collect the historical ODI chase of 434 by SA against Australia. no one expected truly unpredictable .Eh, then at Kolkata India chasing 387 against England.in the test match of course, unpredictable.SA Chasing 414 against Australia, again unpredictable.In the second ODI SA Vs Australia, the smile vanished from Ricky Ponting when the match turned out to be Australia's Favour, but table turned upside down. Bangladesh defeated NZ .unpredictable .   the details will go on IN Cricket, it remains unpredictable as good over from a bowler will change the course of the match.same way the batsman in MIsbah will do or die and if getting the right rhythm finish with all predictions. last ball or last wicket is the main key word of uncertainty even today in the cricket from the time immemorial.|`|YVUM2s6Baa	The unpredictability has increased in 2000 era. How many 280+ scores are chased in 90's era?  In 90s, If a first batting team score 280+, then the result is predictable. But this is not the case in this era. Now, 280 is considered as a modest total. Even, teams are capable of chasing 400+.     Nowadays, we have more last over or last ball victories when compared to 90s.    But, incase of matches involving West Indies, Zimbabwe and New Zealand, the results are predictable as they are weak when compared to their 90s team. The essence of unpredictability is more when top teams compete.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	I think the element of surprise and prediction have gone with the advent of technology; everything from the angle of a batsman's ankle to the number of sweat drops a bowler has on his nose bridge is studied and analyzed in great detail. They have targets for the first 5 over, then the next 3 overs etc etc.  Like everything else in life cricket too has become straight forward or should I say mechanical.|`|AA11088802	That kind of Par period is coming on the way|`|gfxXikenaa	LOL. its actually OPPOSITE to that, mamba~    when did you see scores of 434 getting chased in previous decades~    and when did some one like laxman stole victory for his team following on~    there are many more examples and today there is NO SAFE SCORE at the end of 1st session.  so your observance doesnt have much weight~    EDIT: what objective? im just giving an honest answer, and i INDEED mean it when i say that today's games are unpredictable than past :  if you check the stats you would find that the totals of 300 have been chased in much excess of percentage then they were in the 90s~  those days a total over 280 was considered SAFE and teams could rarely chase it ~  and now......... you would know if you follow the game regularly LIKE ME ~    srini you are talking about the predictability involving minnows, but that has ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME CASE ,even in the 90s so hows that a difference?    in present era the UNPREDICTABILITY  factor is MUCH HIGHER ~|`|iD3XXaMOaa	Well I aint the best person to comment on this one coz I only started watching cricket in 2001. Haha.    But I always thought there was atleast one dominating team in any era. It was West Indies in the 80s and early 90s(?). Then Australia took over. So, there must have been enough one sided matches in the 90s too.    Even in the 21st century we have had our share of one sided matches & some upsets as well. Pakistan being beaten by Ireland. Then Bangladesh beating a few top teams. But overall, I agree that upsets these days are few & far between.    Edit: Yes, you are probably right mate. But as I said I have very little knowledge about cricket that happened prior to the 2000s.|`|7oHt9fTkaa	i don't think so.  even now a days you can see  uncertainty specially in sub continent.if you get a  example from SL vs Bangladesh match,no one thought murali will do so much thing to move up side down Bangla victory.and same as the Pakistan tour of SL.when first ODI  SL losing by 8 wickets,no one thought a 2-1 victory for SL in the end.And you will see that kind of unpredictable series with India also.wait till that.  i'm talking with my experiences and i think that element of unpredictability hasn't been reduced yet.
b2qV9K5Gaa	Woolmer's death will always remain a mystery.. Many people feel it was murder due to Pakistan so called 'shock' loss the day before.. Yes i say so called shock, because nothing Pakistan does these days suprises me.. Just remember how they played last week..   Regarding doping, Asif has been caught numerous times but is yet to be heavily punished( i dont mean financially) doping test should  happen more often during tours in order to rid the game of rotters.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	In the past cricketers were not paid as now, so they were easy preys for the Fixers; now that's not the case, the cricketers are rolling, sleeping and playing on $, so I don't think fixing will again raise its head,  Dope is another matter; sadly it will continue.  Where is it rampant? Why, on this beautiful planet, we call Earth.|`|AA11088802	cant say|`|f9hiPMDxaa	After the furore when match fixing came out, I would be surprised to see it raise its ugly head for a while yet. I don't think cricketers, umpires or officials would be involved in match fixing.     Unfortunately, you will always have individual players who go to the dark side but this is more in drug use than in match fixing but this is in the vasy minority.    We have a much cleaner sport than athletics, weightlifting and baseball.

TLHb2jlaaa	I am not sure but I guess its all because you dont mind blocking just anyone and everyone.     It gives you great joy to have decent users in your blocked list while you support trolls like "I thought my jokes were bad", "Dark knight", "punjabi" with open arms.    You dont give appropiate answers. You always think that the correct answer to a question is India & Sachin. Very rarely do you give correct or appropiate answers. Atleast I have never seen you saying good things about any country other than India.    Lastly, you dont mind abusing Aussies one bit. Can you say one good thing about us? I thought not. I still havent forgotten that you lent you voice in the past in support when someone asked a question saying "Aussies are convicts and racists".    Now ponder over these points and start counting how many good users you have in your blocked list.    Edit: Thanks for unblocking. I have done the same to you. I think you are a pretty nice bloke who is smart enough to know who is good or bad. People who takes to racism, villification & abuse of other users are the only ones you should block. Difference of opinion is part and parcel of life. That's no reason to block anybody.    I dont have any problems with you supporting India or Sachin. But try to give correct answers my friend. The answer to every question is not India. For eg, I did notice that a few days ago when a guy asked "Which team last beat Australia in both ODI & Tests in Australia?". You answered with "India". Now, you surely know that India didnt beat us in the test series. Similarly, there are loads of examples like that.    Anyway, I know you have a good head on your shoulder. You can definitely improve. Just give it a try. You must understand that I am not attacking you. I am just pointing out some inconsistensies. Would you rather have some fair criticism or just blind praise?    Edit: Yeah I guess so. I am willing to be friends with anyone who stays within their limits. I judge people by their answers and not country. I must confess that I have zero tolerance for Aussie haters or Anti-Aussie folks.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	Nice and apt thoughts TBO; I agree with you.

Felt sorry for Lee Wilkie, he was crying.  I hope they get that pitch sorted for the final though, which hopefully the hoops will win, but we'll see.    @ Tam - maybe it is a Mickey Mouse cup and it gets you nothing but it is a trophy at the end of the day, so why would any team not want to win it?  Yes 7-1 does ring a bell, not a hope in hell of doing that with the team we've got the now though.|`|ePFdhsCYaa	Great game, even better penalty shootout. It was a bit ironic how it was Flood who decided the outcome.|`|DpfJfK6Baa	now we're out, I'm not bothered who wins the final.  lets say, on the toss of a coin, celtic.    united were excellent yesterday, in fact I thought both teams played pretty well on a horrendous surface.  man of the match, gary kenneth, a good Mid laddie, turned in his best-ever United performance, Kovacevic never gave McGeady a sniff, the midfield three (especially Jimmy G) were tenacious and energetic, and Big Silky played his usual captains role.    Thought Celtic were much improved after the introduction of Robson and Samaras but I was very disappointed by Robson's laughable penalty claim.      Anyway, bring on the Rangers at Ibrox on saturday, what better way to put the penalty shoot-out behind us than by humping the huns.|`|3uxSproCaa	Certainly did give Celtic a good game, thought maybe the champions fitness level was showing through towards the end, but Dundee Utd. gave a good account of themselves.

They may lose all the time but you gotta like their spirit and the manner in which they play their games.    Bhajji or Warne=====Warne, any day. This comparison is a joke. No explanantion needed.    Micheal Clarke or Micheal Hussey====Michael Hussey. He is called Mr. Cricket for good reasons. When he is form, Hussey is a tough nut to dismiss and he can be an explosive player as well in T20s.    Sri Lanka or Zimbabwe====Sri Lanka. This comparison is another joke. Other than Andy Flower who was a genius, nothing good has ever come out of Zimababwe. Muralitharan's attractive personality only is good enough for me to favour Sri Lanka over Zimbabawe.|`|dqPdoiSYaa	Offspin or Legspin: Off Spin  Steyn or Johnson: Mitchell Johnson  Pakistan or Windies: Pakistan  Bhajji or Warne: Shane Warne anyday  Micheal Clarke or Micheal Hussey: Michael Hussey  Sri Lanka or Zimbabwe: lol Sri Lanka definitely!|`|YVUM2s6Baa	Legspin - Batsman mostly struggles against legspin  Steyn - Performed well against top level teams  W.

Tri Series or IPL: Tri Series  Tri Series will be my pick if the series is played between my favorite teams only.     Test match or ODI or T20: Test Matches  All the three formats are equally enjoyable. But I would rate Test cricket to be a bit better than any of the others.    Lee or Ishant Sharma: Brett Lee  Ishant Sharma is just a talented youngster. He still has a long way to go to prove himself. Lee has been playing for a long time and is undoubtedly one of the best Australian bowlers ever. I will pick Lee ahead of Sharma any day.    AB De Villiers or Herchelle Gibbs: AB De Villiers  He's been in the form of his life at the moment. He has given many match-winning performances in the recent pasts for South Africa.Gibbs is a brilliant batsman, but seeing the form now, De Villiers has been slightly better.     Courtney Walsh or Curtley Ambrose: Courtney Walsh  Very Tough to chose between two of best bowlers ever for the Windies. But as I've got only one choice to pick one, am picking Walsh.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	World Cup  IPL  Test Match, if played by the top teams(Aus, SA, Ind, SL etc)  Ishant, on current form  Gibbs  Tough one, but Ambrose- bowling wise both were equals, but Amby was a better bat.|`|8yMkjeDdaa	World cup  IPL   Testmatch ODI T20  Ishant Sharma  Ab De Villiers   Courtney Walsh  Curtley Ambrose|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	World Cup  Both  All  Lee  AB De Villiers  Courtney Walsh

Afterall, you didnt mention specifically that I would have to choose the best. So, here goes:    Bowling or Batting====Batting. Because its always exciting to hit fours and sixes and to even get a half century. Besides, I was always that type of batsman who would play barely 15 balls but would score 30-40 runs and then get out,lol.    Lara or Tendulkar====Tendulkar. They are both equally great in my eyes. But I like Sachin batting more for some reason.    England or New Zealand=====New Zealand. They may not be a very good at the moment but I wont go wrong if I say I love my neighbours.    Flintoff or Kallis====Flintoff. Kallis is way better than Flintoff but you cant go past Flintoff's charisma and personality. Besides, the way he bats is so damn entertaining.    Phil Hughes or Shaun Marsh====Shaun Marsh. Shaun Marsh has built up such a strong reputation in such a short time. Well, the way this guy has been performing, there's no reason not to like him.    McGrath or Lillie====McGrath. I never saw Lille's bowling. So, from what I have seen, McGrath is the best ever. How many bowlers can get as many wickets as him & still be a miser in terms of giving runs away? Enough said. He is trully great.|`|dqPdoiSYaa	Bowling or Batting: Batting  Lara or Tendulkar: Tendulkar  England or New Zealand: New Zealand  Flintoff or Kallis: Jacques Kallis  Phil Hughes or Shaun Marsh: Shaun Marsh  McGrath or Lillie: Glenn Mcgrath|`|sK3qibRwaa	Both  Tendulkar  England  Kallis  Shaun Marsh  Lillie|`|ZqVz0QR2aa	Bowling or Batting?

They've got nothing to lose - they can always take it to the Big 4|`|HtsowwHBaa	if anyone said to me at the beginning of the season that villa will trail united only by 3 points in january i would say they're nuts...    who knows, its been a great season so far :D|`|7x4VtGtFaa	I asked a similar question earlier, if Villa can overtake Chelsea and Arsenal. The answers are enlightenting.|`|XzhjWTA2aa	I don't think villa will win the league, but i do believe they will secure a champions league spot.  villa are a quality side with a quality manager, and nothing to loose.  that's a dangerous mix.|`|sztJ5dhPaa	They could be but i dont think so. But Champions League position is something they likely to achieve.|`|no3tD0OSaa	Nah..   If Barry had moved to Liverpool, do you really think he'd be getting the first team football he does at Villa.?|`|WmPHrszoaa	Villa = flash in the pan|`|e7WQxGSGaa	no chance, one season wonders....will be a few years before they are ready to challenge the big boys|`|cUJbhspDaa	liverpool thought they would win at christmas being top now look at them fighting for 3rd so wait untill 6 more games and then see where they are but good luck to them|`|AA12122904	I'd love to see Villa win the league but I seriously doubt anyone other than Chelsea will challenge United this year.  A top 4 finish is a great result for them if they can get it|`|mn7cIHCxaa	yes   ha ha ha liverpool|`|ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	Arsenal are the team that are upset, they wont catch villa.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	i would definitely be looking over your shoulder.... they just keep winning!!!!!
DOVbF4Piaa	You go by your inseam size more then height.  A bicycle shop will fit a bike to you, and can make other adjustments that are not related to frame size.  There will be different sizes between a road bike and a mountain or comfort bike for the same person.  This site will tell you how to measure yourself and will suggest the frame size.    http://www.coloradocyclist.com/bikefit|`|3f938a1ffcd84afe57de9879e26aba19aa	well Halfords will do all the dirty work for u.............they did it for me!

The best thing to do is to go to a good bike shop and try some bike and listen to their advice.|`|gnQXkjnMaa	Here's an article on selecting the right sized bicycle frame.  Hope it helps.|`|e8Z1N9wGaa	Go to a bike shop and let them measure you for an exact size. If you are sat on the saddle and have your feet on the pedals your knee should be nearly straight, but not quite and you shouldn't be stretching to the handle bars.  When you get off the bike your crotch shouldn't touch the top tube.
DfPyyDssaa	Yes,it is.  That's the way it's made.|`|VJ1Gsr0Xaa	thats how they are.
SpHfkIHYaa	I have no idea. If he isn't then it was by his choice. Contrary to what some of the people have been saying on here about "Vince doesn't respect his legends", they don't know what they are talking about..at least concerning HBK. If you read Shawn's book then you would know that there have been many times where he has been giving the option to be a champion and he has turned them down. He has said in his book as well as in many interviews, and from other sources that HBK does what is best for WWE and the ratings, he doesn't care much more for titles and the spotlight. Besides, HBK has alot of creative and influence within WWE and is one of Vince's best men. So whatever they decide we will see.    As far as him retiring this year. He isn't. He has expressed that his time coming very soon. He hasn't giving a date though. So whatever people are saying about WM26 is all speculation.|`|ikyij2g3aa	I think he will be in it and they might make JBL betraying him and causing him to lose his chance at the title at wrestle mania and to stop him from stealing the show which will enrage shawn and cause him to stop being his employee and sweet chin music him on the next raw and eventually lead the storyline into wrestle mania.|`|KIOR56r6aa	No, he's busy being someone's b1tch because WWE have no respect for their legends.|`|dGYR81enaa	Well, JBL will fire him next week, then he will qualify for the elimination chamber and win the WHC and face orton at Wrestlemania... TRUST ME!|`|8Im1iGFTaa	i dont think so i think hewill face jbl at NWO|`|YhfMrppSaa	I think, or JBL vs him at WM or next ppv      chance for him winning the chamber is zero, vince got no respect for his legend, what so ever.     Sorry    no offense|`|RskPXtibaa	yes of course he alredy qualified|`|WZDJXXMXaa	I don't know, but I sure hope so. He is the best.|`|94c52e622f8386f41ece9ca78c8861dcaa	It will be interesting if he wins a qualifying match JBL will ethier go in or say shawn is wrestling on JBL's behalf I don't think HBK will retire this year maybe WM26|`|qVDY1hm5aa	No, I don't think so. I think he'll carry on the feud until No Way Out, where it'll be JBL vs. Shawn Michaels. Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker at WrestleMania 25 looks like it's going to be on the cards.
3b1KrGHTaa	I laughed the entire time. Federer's shots are unbelievable, and the way he returns Roddick's serve is hilarious. He sticks out his racket and next thing you know, he hits a winner. The first set was great, the next two showed Roddick trying nearly everything to no avail. Total annihilation.     It upsets me that some commentators are saying that Nadal can beat Federer in the finals, mostly because a part of me fears that it's true. The way Rafa has been playing is incredible, but there's a bigger part of me that knows that Federer is too good, too brilliant. Total annihilation. I hope.|`|w8fP7aBNaa	as a nadal fan, im crapping myself! i think rafa has no chance im afraid!|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	It looks federer is back to his best.He is looking really dangerous.Its up to another final of federer and nadal this australian open.The way federer played shows he is eager to own australian open this year.|`|AA11422321	My wife was happy, i wasn't :(|`|c46a4fbd2c6a4c512dd76cd2d2cc0b44aa	I wasn't surprised. I know Federer would win considering his 15-2 standing against Andy.     I really hope Roger crushes Rafa on the finals. It would be sweet revenge for Roger for being defeated at Wimbledon and Roland Garros.|`|uWYlumvsaa	Nice match from Federer. He didn't play perfectly, but he played good enough......without mistakes. Assuming he'll play Rafa Nadal in the final, he knows he'll be facing a brutal, uphill battle against a guy that has practically owned him. I'm sure Federer will be favorite to hit No. 14 by most, but don't be surprised if Nadal steals Fed's joy away from him yet again. Sure, Fed is the slightly better hardcourt player, but it will mean absolutely nothing. If he doesn't beat Nadal in Sunday's final, it will be somewhat humiliating, having lost to him in a grand slam final on EVERY surface. We shall see what happens. Best of luck to them both on Sunday.|`|nE9BaUWIaa	It's easy when you have a 15-2 record against someone. Like I said before, you've got to out ace Roddick. His game lives and dies by it.|`|Dtgw3jkdaa	Gutted.
lYkvps54aa	maybe not the league wazza but martin o'neil did the same at celtic by signing big strong players.     i think they will qualify for the champions league as they have a big squad.    thats what he does, hes a good man manager.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Yeah! Well done, that's pretty good!  But it wont last cause Arsenal will finish  4th.|`|juTQEZWoaa	no way willl they win the league but they will qualify for sure arsenal are in a huge slump|`|GjpWEu6Raa	YOU CANNOT BELIEVE IT     HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL    THE SEASON TO FINISH 4TH AND THE LEAGUES TIGHTER THEN A DUCKS BOTTOM      MAN U ALSO HAVE LIVERPOOL,CHELSEA AND IM NOT SURE IF VILLA &ARSENAL TO PLAY AT HOME       "SQUEEKY BOTTOMS TIME"
4a3c4c50a6a9e82506477f10b7f1fbdfaa	yeah it was a terrible game, but i have to take into account that they only practiced like 3 days together, whereas The MLS is not playing at the moment and the USMNT had plenty of time to build team chemistry..|`|7Xridrxaaa	haha idiot you cannot judge mexico's performances on one game in which we used our b-squad. Let us not forget most of these players wont even be playing against the US or in the World Cup qualifiyers. So i am sure just like we kept our mouth shut about a US team struggling yet beating a Sweden team (except for Kido who is a US butt licker) you can keep your mouth shut. We lost because of a defensive blunder. The US needed a penalty and a beautiful freekick by Sacha to score in the first half.|`|VAMEPo0Waa	Viva Mexico|`|LAdeGGGFaa	most of the players for the U.S and Mexico that played Sweden, are not going to play feb 11.|`|6uc8ROfWaa	duh u *** we all did and that aint the end of the world just wait and see who duz best in the world cup mayb ya will win 1 game and if we beat ya or dont that dont mean your better mexico till i die|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	US destroy Sweeden...3-2 is destroying now?    @ rafa: man that wasnt even mexico's B team, that was their C team|`|ed0ySnCmaa	SH!T,DYANAMO 187 IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|o2kW3eG0aa	we all saw the game... and yes were disappointed. but non of those players are ganna play xcept for like 2 for mexico and maybe 2 for the usa... so who ever is best that day is ganna win.   Dont forget MR POWERHOUSE THAT MEXICO ALWAYS DOES BETTER THAN THE USA WHEN IT MATTERS.  maybe the usa will win one game in the world cup next year        CRIS G----- IF MEXICO SUX SO MUCH THEN WHY DO YOU GET SO EXCITED TO WEN YOUR TEAM BEATS US?  BECAUSE YOU LIKE BEEATING YOUR DADDY *****... WHOSE YOU F****** DADDY?|`|TovUBgidaa	i saw the game.. but we are so gonna win! dnt worry. just because we loose this one doesn't mean we are gonna lose the next one! we are gonna be mad and confident and gonna win! one more thing stop hating on our team! we mexico fans are with them in their loses and their wins! no matter what we are always there for the team! that's how we roll. We are NOT going to bail out on this game! hell NO! we play and win! thts how it is! MEXICO ASTA LA MUERTE!|`|AA11518933	Yeah I undestand Sven was playing players who were first timers, not starters, but Sweden was was playing their C team. This lost for Mexico was very disapointing, It seems Mexico is lost with Sven or Sven is lost with Mexico. I feel bad for Sven but hey he knew his azz would be on the line in Mexico( pressure demasiado)  In regards to team USA, right now they are moving in a positive direction, good team chemistry, a coach who's from USA and knows american players well, Team USA has a solid foundation and discipline, you have to admit they are pretty good team and each year they get better, mostly all there NT starters play in Europe, some are bench warmers but's that's ok in time. I think it's pay back for those years MX dominated, now it's the USA turn.|`|f4w9NkETaa	haha Destroyin?? 3-2?? bro that aint destroyin, if US would of beaten sweden 3-1, 3-0 then u could call that destroy.. just cuz mx  lost one game in a friendly doesnt mean that they are gna have a bad year, just wait til mexico get their sht straight and get all the stars back then will see whos the big giant of the concacaf..     hahaha US beats MX everytime.. thats funny.. bro ur on crack...|`|JiKNOtvdaa	Mexico didn't play with the players they usually do, but vs. USA you'll see better players that will destroy USA 3-0|`|b4uCTRABaa	usa didn't kill sweden you guys barley won by a goal and they were some Lucky *** goals.but mexico loses fair and square|`|82fd54d1c65455ed9c17232b1e7b390baa	So that match did nt mean anything. I mean Barsa lost their first match in the regular season but then beat that team for pay back. So just cause mexico lost doesnt mean we are 110% sure that USA will win. So shut the hell up.|`|vt2VS0lDaa	I saw it last tuesday|`|xepff87Haa	i did see this game but in consideration Mexico had non of there star players. And its true that the United States now more than just the underdog its futbol has become very impressive but i have think that this sport is more than just skills. Its about money too for example if Mexico can beat Brazil why do they loose to the USA which lost to Brazil...... we might never know but back to your question yes i saw the game and it was disappointing  (Mexico still has two wins over the United States in there history of playing so USA is catching up....Good luck to both teams)|`|enoFj0MWaa	ye sweden are good tho lol and they have top players like kallstrom ibrahimovic olsson etc|`|C3RCunFoaa	To answer your question, yes i did see mexico lose.      you're right usa did destroy, in a goal difference of 1.|`|CWTRdrQaaa	If US fans would stop sayin ****** about da MNT, ans get out of the Mexico SocceRT Fourm, i would have respect fr the USNT, and maby go to one of thier games.......|`|aNnmH3R4aa	Alright people.....WHO LET THE DOG OFF ITS LEASH??        Spud.....Kiddo....Is this your Mut right here?|`|4bhJVOmBaa	yeah I saw both the U.S. and Mexico games against sweden.  Honestly both teams (U.S. and Mexico)  looked weak.  But, Mexico still gets more props in the world stage.  Maybe because they go to international tournaments like Copa America and the Confed. Cup and beat some good teams.  The U.S. does not want to "Man Up" and play anyone like a Brasil or Argentina.  I remember Mexico beating Argentina and even my Brasil in a couple of international tourneys.  Who has the U.S. beat?  Mexico... who you look so down upon.  If Mexico is your biggest win... than as a Team you are weak as well.  Know your role U.S.  Viva Brasilia!!!!!!|`|No7cWEKIaa	Hey edmister, how can you say Mexico always beats the US when it counts? I remember a pretty important game in the freaking world cup when mexico got worked. Sven has no chance of leading this team anywhere.|`|GmfE8RzHaa	What **** are you a fortune teller to say Mexico is going to lose!|`|SVmsA8MMaa	you know what shut up damn mexico is a winner they just don't have thier good players like rafa marquez andres guadado nery castillo and the best mexican goalie ochoa mexicans can play soccer|`|FbmMnIg5aa	USA  destory Sweden ha they scored double on yall and dont forget one of yalls goal was a penalty     it really dosent matter because USA sucks TOO so it not like yall are closer to winning a world cup or anything so yea it dosent matter|`|ZPKpednIaa	Dynamo. I'm a US fan, but I really wish you'd stop doing this crap. You're giving the USMNT a lot of bad karma, and we're gonna look real stupid if we lose on 2/11. Just watch the game and hope for the best. Peace to everybody and all fans.|`|YRnbqszzaa	Jumping to conclusions doesn't win you anything. Both Mexico and the US National Team have a chance at winning. I'm a Mexico fan, but I refuse to bash the US National Team. Oh, and don't go speaking lies; the US hasn't even come close to beating Mexico every time.
YcvKwRqiaa	Coz he's a lazy bugger!    Edit. But apart from that, whenever I think up of a question, someone's either already asked it or the amount of retards responding with drivel put me off asking any more.  But I understand the reason why you're asking this so I'll attempt to be more proactive. But there are two things that may prove to be an issue.  One is that footy season is just around the corner so,I'll be going back and forth from here to there...  And the second is that I know everything anyway!    Edit. Everyone got a thumbs up except for the joker (mate you don't know crap), kela, fat head guy and punjabi. And I'm sure you can guess why.|`|gfgJUt62aa	asterix aka TB official only thumb up people like kerr TBO, troll buster official, another fella supporting racism|`|1524096e5bddfd306a16addaf018f46eaa	Asterix asked 3 or 4 questions this month in Cricket section  Check his profile  This section isnt looking so interesting these days Good users shoud ask more questions  THere are a few users who ask one question every day while others ask only 3 or 4 questions in a month here|`|eXB1ypZnaa	I agree Evan.    Instead of sitting back and complaining (which ive been guilty of) smart users, should ask Good Cricket Questions which should spark some life into the Cricket Question.    Instead of waiting for some user to ask a Question, maybe we should ask one ourselves. It shouldn't matter how many crap Q's there are, if there is 10 Decent Cricket Q's asked after it inside an hour.    Maybe we should all get involved!! and here's an idea. TALK ABOUT CRICKET.    Asterix asked a Q about Haddin once i believe!|`|LzkujA3Faa	I remember answering at least 5 questions of him since i have come to this section. Like Oracle said, not enough people ask questions here,including me. But it is not fair to put the blame on Asterix.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	For a start Asterix is NOT a girl, and he spends time in the Aus football section which I gather is his favourite in football season.I enjoy his witty comments & I hope he keeps coming here.|`|gfxXikenaa	he's one cool guy who doesnt stress too much , and punjabi he's a nice unbiased fella. i think you have a wrong perception abt him`~|`|Leoc8rlGaa	Not enough people ask questions full stop. It's not just Asterix. I ask plenty, and there are a few others, but many people rarely, or never, ask anything.    For the past few weeks I havde been coming on here and seeing little, if anything, worth answering.    If there are no questions to answer, this perhaps reflects that not enough decent questions are being asked.    But I think it is a little unfair to single out Asterix. There needs to be bigger contributions from everybody.|`|wPlfPc0gaa	Criticizing Asterix will be hypocrisy from my part, since it is long since  I have posted a question. I am not as active as I used to be. Trust me, I am planning to change it in a couple of weeks time, as currently time is an expensive commodity for me.|`|AA11088802	HE ask two Q since tomorrow|`|91e2b57c649a78f3809de6d411c1a263aa	maybe he ran out of questions like me.|`|8w9JZlaGaa	i wonder, you people have been here for ages and i am a pretty new user in here  still i know that she is a girl , not a guy  every one calls her a guy  and i thought my jokes were bad  though she is not a good joker for sure|`|iD3XXaMOaa	Now now, lets not force people to ask questions mate. He can only ask when there is something to ask. Usually guys like Rahul Rocks, Ange, Binga keeps us posted about the current events in the world of cricket. So, there is nothing left for us to ask. Many users like me also dont like to ask random questions just for the sake of it. I usually ask a Q here if I am excited about something or I need to know something. So, I guess that's the deal with Asterix. But lets not forget that he does ask questions although not regularly.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	I can give you a reason why he doesnt ask or what makes him not to ask.    Lets take my case for example, from what I have seen in this section the cricket questions asked are mostly about performances of teams while playing a match and related questions,team selection during a match or for a series, some questions on trivia,some captions and sometimes controversies on statements made by some players before or after a series.    But the reason why I dont feel like asking questions like this is because if I dont ask, surely somebody else will ask.So if I get something which is other than all this I may feel like asking.I also try to have some humor in it as well,some side topics.    TBH sometimes I find the cricket section quite boring that I may spend a few hours  scanning but actually answer nothing!!!!  The reason is because I find the same kind of questions repeated for that part of the day    However I like answering your question because sometimes it is a little interesting    Maybe Asterix feels the same way as me or maybe even one step ahead.Perhaps he hasnt found a topic which he would have liked to be asked as a question|`|4VoQduaZaa	May be if he changes his nickname to 'Question Mark', he can start asking questions :-)) Just kidding.|`|AA0L7X2Oaa	wat team he is from|`|lckvYTdHaa	"Why doesn't Asterix never ask a question in the cricket section?"    You've used a double negative there, Evan. replace "never" with "ever", and your question will make more sense ;-)

USY1XHfbaa	My favourite player is Roger but at the same time I hate to see Andy lose. The postgame interviews with A-rod are always classic, so I guess it's not that bad. A semi final at the AO is a really good start to the year for Roddick and I really hope he continues this way. Andy played a decent match but he was facing a hungry Federer who was not going to be stopped. I really don't like either Nadals or Verdascos chances in the finals, but you never know.    Back to Andy. He showed he could beat "the Djoker" on the big stage, and I feel if heat weren't a factor he still would have came out on top. His backhand is no longer just a liability and his overall game has improved. He never took enough chances against Fed-X and was playing Roger's game rather his own.     Oh yea and I couldnt help but laugh in the final game when Roger challenged his own serve that was called out. Andy immediately knew it was in and said "you guys get paid for this, right?" And he was right and so was his remark as Federer was 5 for 5 on challenges in the match. LOL.|`|Wg3UySpfaa	as good as i think andy has become, he will just never beat federer. He might be good enough to beat a lot of good players, but he is just not compatible with federer. I honestly think he gets a little intimidated by federer before they even start playing. He even got more aces than andy...too bad.|`|I9cmOie8aa	it was a good match but i dont think andy played  his best. he could have done better. Oh well there is always next year. :D|`|Pl7GnQfqaa	I like both of them but after those two dodgy calls but that line umpire early in the match, Andy seemed to lose his cool and got a bit more emotional every time the ball was called out.  Fed's hard to beat at the best of times!|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	Nothing to worry.Good effort from roddick.Federer is a great person to play against and its tough to beat him.|`|RC4K4TQ4aa	watching Roddick getting dominated was quite entertaining.|`|nE9BaUWIaa	It's easy to beat Andy. Federer does it by serving more aces than him in their matches. Roddick's game lives and dies by his aces.|`|c46a4fbd2c6a4c512dd76cd2d2cc0b44aa	in tennis, there are no lucky shots just like there are no lucky punches in boxing.     When Federer is playing at his best (which he is), no amount of hoping or wishing can make him lose.     That's all there is to it. I know Federer would win the moment he got paired up with Andy.    Roger's standing against Andy was 15-2. The first defeat was back in 2003 and Roger is still not known as the mighty genius he is today. The second one was last year but he had glandular fever and mono during that time.    Roddick will never beat a healthy Federer at his best.|`|xUrEnxIGaa	OK , If you insist, you foolish girl|`|uWYlumvsaa	Although I don't like him, I do feel a bit for him. He played well up to this point, and of course he hyped himself up with the thought he could win this. Andy's shots just weren't good enough, and Federer capitalized. Sure, Federer's found great form in the last 2 matches, but, if he has to play Nadal in Sunday's final, he'll have to get No. 14 against a guy who's never shown him any mercy. I wish Fed luck. He'll need it.........and then some!!!    Roddick will bounce back. He just ran into the wrong player at the wrong time.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Both the runnersworld site and the halhigdon site have great plans for beginners.    You've been at it for 2 months, your conditioning should be good enough for you to start a marathon program, rely on those sites for a good, proven program.  The tips I'm going to give will be of a more general nature:    -Keep a log of your running.  Include total time, miles, and a brief description of anything you think is important (weather, how you were dressed for that particular weather, course, how you felt, anything unusual)    -Don't obsess about it.  I'm an experienced runner, preparing for my first marathon, and I'll admit it, I'm obsessed.  I spend way more time and energy than I should thinking about, researching, daydreaming, and obsessing about running.  Set aside the time for these things each day, and outside of that time don't let yourself continually go on about it.    -Have fun.  You've said that this was one of your dreams.  I'm certain no part of that dream was to go out and make yourself miserable for an hour each day preparing for the race.  Enjoy it.  All of it, training included.  Pick scenic routes to train on, daydream or listen to your favorite music while you run, make friends within the running community.    -Do your research.  A race like a marathon requires this.  Again, let me refer you to runnersworld, they've got a ton of information.    I hope your marathon is everything you've dreamed of!  Just curious, what marathon do you have in mind?|`|0bzIkdyOaa	Find a beginners training plan and follow it. some good websites are :    www.runnersworld.com and coolrunning.com also  www.halhigdon.com has a plan that is easy too. find one that best suites your ability.   The long runs are the most important.|`|mTXHW3lzaa	Begin with working your easy runs to the point that you can run the distance of a marathon with little distress at an easy pace, that way you know confidently that you can do the distance. Next its very important that you can handle the terrain, hill workouts will make a huge difference with this. A good routine would be one long run a week, 2 medium runs, 1 hill run and an easy recovery run. Remember, its very easy to get injured by over training for a marathon, its not a sin to skip a workout day because your not feeling your hottest. Rest is critical! You wont improve if you don't give your body a chance to recover! Good for you and good luck!|`|TKNPveHDaa	First, you should have at least a half year of regular running to even start thinking about training for a marathon.  If you've only started, your body isn't really ready for the abuse you're about to undergo.    July is a ways away, but you need to go out and buy a book or go to the library and get educated quickly.  Knowledge is the most important key to a successful marathon.  The training programs, diet programs, and insight on gear and motivation will help you more then anyone on the internet can.  Go to Barnes & Noble and buy some literature.    Good luck!    Detroit Marathon 2006 - 4:24:45  Cape Code Marathon 2007 - 4:17:35|`|7fcfff4308bf09439ecbf47e67c14035aa	Hi, I am glad that you are interested in running a marathon. I ran the Marine Core Marathon in 2007 with a time of 3 hours and 30 min when I was 17, and that was my first marathon.    My advice to you is to research several different kinds of programs.  Just google marathon training programs and check them out. I used several different programs and found out what was good for me. I used advice from one, and advice from others to make a custom program for myself.    You also need to give yourself at least 4 months to train. That would be the minimum I would recommend.  If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask me.

U7BkuEU9aa	Because he's a self-important whiner...he's undeniably good, but Rafa and Fed are in a whole other dimension.|`|rHz1RyWiaa	Djokovic is a very good player, but he is so whiney.  It's always good to see him lose.  I was excited to see Roddick put him out.  Nadal and Federer will continue to dominate for awhile.|`|KF2yg9Ovaa	he's arrogant...and lacks the class that those two have...he's good, but i agree he has a long way to go|`|02d0dbba77861d90576aef0958f8bca9aa	I'm not really sure if it is Djokovic who is putting himself in that category, or if it is the media/commentators...?  His mother perhaps?  :P  In any case, you are right, he is nowhere near Nadal or Federer in the Grand Slam wins category.  However, he does have a few achievements that merit recognition as one of the best tennis players around:    1.  He was able to sneak in a Grand Slam win when Federer and Nadal had a monopoly of all the Grand Slams (with a win over Federer en route to the finals).  Noone else except Safin has been able to accomplish this (and Safin's win came early on when Federer and Nadal had not fully exerted their dominance).    2.  He has been at the number 3 ranking for a year and a half now.  And, remember, this time last year, he started to become a threat to the number two ranking.  Also, just a few weeks ago, he could have overtaken Federer if things had gone his way.  So, he has displayed some consistency, albeit just below the level of Federer and Nadal.    So, while he doesn't belong in the same category as Federer and Nadal (I'm not even sure if those two belong in the same category), based on his performance the past couple of years, he has been a notch above everyone else.  He still has time to get his act together and prove his worth as a tennis player.|`|LALDdLkNaa	Cause hes arrogant.  He needs to change his atitude and approach if hes going to get better hes defo talented but mentaly hes not as good and hes not got there consistency.|`|gBMSx1Jgaa	cuz he thinks he is as good as them... which obviously most people dont agree... djoko is a good player, but he needs to collect some slams first before he can be at par with federer and nadal...|`|iD3XXaMOaa	I dont think Djokovic puts himself in the same league as those two. He is certainly not arrogant. He is the World No.3 and if he has every right to make a few confident statements about himself. However, he never said that he was as great as Nadal and Federer.    I agree with you that Nadal and Federer are head and shoulders above Djokovic. But then that doesnt mean, Djokovic will never attain that much success. He has many years ahead of him and he is consistently improving. He has the potential to be as great as those two in the future. Just give him time to prove himself.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Ok, if Djokovic's not close to them now, at least, he has been that close in chances of winning the slams they enter together and in other matches where he has beaten the top 2. Djokovic is just being him - a rather smug but more, a highly self-confident player. I'm rather ok with his impersonation of other players. However, sometimes I just can't stand his over-c0ckiness (being proud is normal, that's a nature of every human, but sometimes Djokovic is just overly showing it off). Overall, I respect him as a great player.|`|Vbmq0lupaa	It's not Djokovic who puts himself in their league. It's the media. Notice that after Andy Murray reached the US Open final last year and defeated both Nadal and Federer on the way to the Aussie Open '09, the media were all blabbing on about him having the biggest chance of winning the AO. And yet he got ousted in the 4th round. He may be a great player, but not experienced enough to be a true title contender. Maybe later in the year, but not now.    It's mostly the media, really. Last year after Djokovic won the AO, they kept hyping him up as the next big thing. Now he seems to be performing erractically and crumbling under the pressure of defending his hard court titles. But I don't think he was ever arrogant enough to state that he was in Fed and Nadal's league.|`|LKVTY2EPaa	I don't think that Djokovic is in the same category as Nadal and Federer, but he probably feels since he used to dominate Nadal on hardcourts, that he should be included with him. I don't think Murray should discussed in the same conversation with the three but he is. I guess it just happens.|`|by7BQ2npaa	Djokovic did not put himself with Nadal and Federer.  He naturally got in there by his own merit.  It's not just the number of grand slams won, but it is also staying power.  The three of them, also known as the "Big 3", have clearly been in their own league because of how consistent they are in getting to semifinals, finals and winning during tournaments, week-in week-out.  They tend to face each other (either Federer vs. Nadal, Federer vs. Djokovic, Djokovic vs. Nadal, etc.), but unfortunately this is where Djokovic has been losing because he has had to face either Federer or Nadal in the semis, which is a reason why he hasn't had as much opportunity to win more titles or slams. That only shows how natural their talents are and how fit and strong they are physically and mentally.  The rest of the tour are clearly not in the level of the Big 3.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	it does't really bothers me what he thinks (or for any other what they think)..and whatever it is that he thinks of himself, in my opinion, has not resulted in actions that are any way unacceptable in tennis...  if djokovic puts himself in the same league as nadal and federer, well its his choice..maybe its his motivation to be competitive and do good in tennis, or maybe he's just a little conceited, or maybe...but then,  what's really wrong with it?!|`|e7B8WkkIaa	Wishful thinking. Some reporter told him that he was and his publicity guy agreed.

CDeZOLmgaa	I see no way Hatton wins this, and I would have said this prior to the DeLaHoya fight, he looked good in his fight with Malinagi but he did not have any power to worry about. When Manny lands it is going to hurt, I think Hatton is damaged goods, fighters like Hatton usually do not have long careers into their 30's so hes doing well for himself, he drinks between fights, puts on all kinds of weight between fights, thats not good , make no mistake even with Mayweather in his corner Hatton is at the end of his career and Manny is at the peak of his.    Manny vs Hatton will be a more competitive version of his fight with David Diaz but the end result will be the same.    Manny TKO 10|`|dh48AkbCaa	first of all, if hatton wins, i don't believe the will claim the best pound 4 pound title, as marquez, calzaghe and isreal vazquez will each move up one place, leaving hatton about 4th.    as for the outcome, i've learned my lesson picking against pacquiao, but hatton will be much tougher than de la hoya or david diaz were, so either way, it's gonna be a tough battle.|`|b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	"If Hatton wins he is gonna claim to be the best p4p but i dont think thats true."    If Hatton can beat the current number 1 best P4P boxer then yes he should be classed as the best P4P boxer!! It's just plain logic! If he can beat the best of the best then who else is there to beat? He'd be ranked number 1.    If Hatton steps up from his normal weight to fight Pacquiao then I can't see him winning.    Either way, it's gonna be a cracking fight, two exciting boxers with a lot to lose. Come on Hatton!!! :)|`|3jBUJxOdaa	as ruddiger said it, hatton vs pacman is the more competitive version of diaz vs pacman..pacquiao will have to work a little harder and the result will be likely be the same - a tko by pacman..afterwards, pacman will face mayweather in a battle of p4p kings..if pacman wins, well, he'll be remembered as one of the top 5 best boxers of all time, if mayweather does not come out, pacquiao may have to face marquez, that is to settle things all out...    but, although unlikely, hatton wins, the best fight for him will be mayweather also, which in all likeliness will be easily won by mayweather again..if mayweather won't fight, the best there is is a rematch with pacquiao, especially if their first fight is damn close..

qHagqx0Jaa	Arizona is going to win the superbowl. Look at the facts... Arizona is the most underrated team out there. Then we have possibly the best offense in the country with Kurt Warner, Larry Fitzgerald, and Anquan Boldin. The defense has been BEAST recently. Warner > Rothliswhatever, Fitzgerald (easily best reciever in NFL) > Ward or Holmes. Polamalu is pretty damn good but he cant carry the whole team. ARIZONA!!!|`|AA12284392	The winner at the Superbowl?

However the way Arizona has been playing lately they were the team I didnt want to have my team play. All you got to do is open your newspaper and look at the spread. They got the steelers by 9 i think.|`|F5GyrdQfaa	Just based on the Championship Games I think the Cardinals have a pretty good shot as long as they protect Warner from that Steeler defense. Only problem being that Warner seemed to rely almost entirely on his wide recievers, and the Steelers are good at getting 'panic-close' to opponent QBs before the recievers get in position.     As long as it isn't a wash-out I'll be happy. Parity rarely works anywhere else, but it sure does make for entertaining football!
2sxiHRvzaa	we are skint|`|m2zXOREJaa	Mind you in saying that it dont reflect well on the EPL as he started at Man City.|`|ePFdhsCYaa	So Bougherra didn't play 34 games for Charlton last season and then 28 times for Sheffield Wednesday the season before that? Did Flood not play 25 times for Cardiff before he moved to United?    The Championship overall is still a more competitive league than the SPL and most of thier clubs have higher wage structures than both the old firm.|`|nH4TOhGVaa	Well i have not seen them in england but i guess i'll just take your word for it.Although i thought flood has a good game last night.|`|7EuVbDAYaa	I dident think i would ever be saying this, but i gotta agree with linzi    it works both ways... look a boumsong, he was a massive hit in the spl. then went to newcastle and became the worst defender in the EPL. then i think he has done ok since moving to juventus.     and as linzi said, graveson was a great player for everton and real madrid, then was a massive flop at parkheed.     players can become good/bad when changing leagues. through a few things. here is a few    1. the suitablity of the league, as in like how physical/skillfull it is    2. the club they go to might suit there style    3.just the standard of the club they go to can make them worse/better    4.having to fight for first team places at bigger clubs, when there used to walking into a team    5. the manager at there club can determane if they play well. like if he has confidence in the player    6.the amostphere when playing home matches can help them, and there is non better than at ibrox|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Different players are suited to different styles of playing and at different levels.  How could Graveson not do well in the spl when he did at a much higher level? You'd think our "bad" football would be a breeze for him.

With Given flirting with Man City and Owen constantly being linked with Villa, I can't see the top players being held on to. I'd like to see them stay up as they used to be a very interesting team to watch, Shearer was simply sensational, but right now I don't think they have the managerial structure to maintain their Premiership status. Were they to get rid of Mike Ashley and get somebody with some knowledge and sense and get a more reputable manager than Joe Kinnear, I could see them reaching the heights which the size of the club suggests they should be reaching.|`|gYThMID8aa	I've been optimistic for over 50 years and I'm not going to change now.

I think we should get an English Manager.|`|0KVws6REaa	If that Portugese tw*t becomes manager of LFC I will no longer support them.    Yes, we did lose the league in January and Rafa can take some of the blame but remember there are still 11 guys running around on the pitch.    We need to sort the ownership problem out and the Rick Parry situation but I still feel Rafa will be at Real next season.    It's a shame Mark Hughes went to City, he would have been an ideal replacement.  Maybe we should bring back King Kenny?|`|peFtORvUaa	Totally disagree..was mighty p1ssed at benyoun the other day but hes made up for it by scoring last night.    Lucas was unlucky with the penalty and he   is definately a future star,remember hes still only 21,he will get better and better.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Lucas is an idiot - I am sorry but liverpool please - send him on loan or something to get more experience - why did he bring Koumas down , he was no threat .|`|mn7cIHCxaa	ha ha ha liverpool|`|7x4VtGtFaa	My goodness, I hope you are not pointing fingers this early!|`|V4STBjyFaa	the fat spanish waiter should be given a job for life|`|AA11076076	Yes I want Jose too .|`|FVlQ8dWwaa	It's not Lucas,it's rafa that cost liverpool the league.  I personally think they should sack him and get jose.|`|8ORwpuTuaa	It was not Rafa who controlled the ball at the time.        What Rafa needs to do is to tell the team that once they are a goal up against the other side, they should not relax and let their guard down,         It is a team effort - both Rafa AND the players.   Next time, let us hope they pile the pressure on the other side once they are a goal up.|`|Ix0M7mpgaa	Why does Rafa keep a notepad and pen with him during a game?....      Because he's teaching the team how to draw! :-D|`|AA12042538	Well I agree that what Rafa said was stupid...     U don't take on Sir Alex, he is the master of mind games! You just can't go around making allegations like that. I don't believe that those were FACTS as benitez put it, they were just his opinions ultimately!     He may well have had a point but then again Rafa's one to talk because he has criticised refs and got away with it!     If Liverpool win the title... It'll all be forgotten BUT if they fail then everyone will look back on rafa's comments and take the view that it was those that cost LFC the EPL title.|`|SZsl07Gbaa	Sack Max from "Max & Paddy", Manuel doesnt have a clue anymore. His tactics are to not lose and they work cause Liverpool dont lose they just draw all the friggin time.

me36q49Qaa	Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch. They offered the stadium to Fulham Football Club, but the offer was turned down. As a consequence, the owners decided to form their own football club to occupy their new ground. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge. Since there was already a football club named Fulham in the borough, the founders decided to adopt the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea for the new club, having rejected names such as Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C...

DLxh9CANaa	I am- and I am praying that Nicanor will be safe when he makes his racing debut, either this Saturday or next, at Gulfstream Park in Florida. It wouldn't hurt to say a prayer for Barbaro's and Nicanor's connections, either- they are still healing, and could use some support. As for the retirement homes, we are still a long ways away from having enough of those- and that situation isn't likely to improve any time soon, not with the economy in such dire straits.    To Phlegm: You don't know what you are talking about, so do everyone here a favor and be quiet. Barbaro died from a DISEASE, NOT from his injuries- by the time of his death, the original fractures had HEALED completely, and he eventually would have walked sound if it hadn't been for the laminitis. I can find no fault with the decisions made by either the Jacksons or by Dr. Richardson, his vet- and by the way, the Jacksons tried to save that colt BECAUSE THEY LOVED HIM, and for NO OTHER REASON. To them, he was like their own child, and how many parents DO YOU KNOW who WON'T FIGHT to save a child who is critically ill or injured, REGARDLESS of the costs?  I can't think of many myself, and somehow doubt that you can either. What happened to Barbaro WASN'T about money- it was about LOVE- and that's something which you apparently don't understand. Enough said.|`|uNGJe5GBaa	Until I read this, I didn't realize it's been two years since he died.

Barbaro was a true champion and I will always remember him by his Derby win and not what happened to him.|`|URO3gDXcaa	not me.  sorry to be so crass, but the horse should have been put down earlier.    but i do know what i am talking about - the end result.  they wasted money on trying to save a horse the vet said can't be saved.|`|KVlRYoidaa	who can ever forget barbaro,the twin brother of edgar prado.

But the thing I would do it just buy one of the plastic bat tubes at your local sports card store. They are about 10-15 dollars and worth it for storage. Good luck with it.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Keep it out of strong light, and keep it dry, until you can deliver it. Shouldn't be any more tricky than that.

I turned and while I was tussling with him a passing driver ran over and they both ran off.  Police apprehended both suspects.    - lone assailant, boxcutter, late afternoon on a section of a subway platform (there were some people around).  He blocked my path after I made a purchase at a newstand.  He drew out the boxcutter right in front of me,  menacingly.  When I saw there was no way around I had to make a grab at his hand and cranked it backwards as hard as I could while shouting for help.  During the scuffle we must have gotten too close to the edge and he slipped off one leg and fell down to the tracks.  I ran back to the clerk and someone got a hold of the police.  He probably landed in a bad way, maybe directly on his leg or broke something when he hit the steel because I don't remember him getting up when I ran off for help.  I got a rather painful cut on one hand and received stitching for it.    - mass assault, 7-8 attackers, one picked up a wooden broom stick or handle from a garbage area, evening hours on the street.  I must have been in a brain fart at that time because I stumbled directly into their hangout.  These were some type of a gang and they didn't want me there.  Probably the toughest thing you could ever face.  I managed to run and fight, run and fight, but got knocked down several times.  It's basically like fighting through thick mud.  Ducked a few haymakers when one guy picked up a stick and came at me.  I instinctively put up an arm to block the blow ( I was wearing a down jacket so there was some cushioning).  I somehow got a grip on the other end of the stick and used a prying technique against his hand that broke his grip from the stick.  I managed to strike several of them in the head and legs with the freed stick and that's when they backed off and I was able to fully get on my feet and make my escape.  I was pretty banged up. Bystanders were of no help...all they did was stand there like zombies.  Something you can never forget.

4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	Campfire Stew    1lb cubed beef  4-6 red russet potatoes  6 stalks celery  6 carrots  Garlic Salt  Black Pepper  Butter or good margarine  Tin foil    Take a 12"x12" square of tin foil and smear butter on it.  Slice the celery and carrots and potatoes into bitesize pieces.  Place one serving of meat, potato, celery and carrot on in the center of the tin foil.  Sprinkle with Garlic salt and pepper  You may want to add about one more tablespoon of butter right in the center of the food - this will help minimize sticking.  Tightly wrap the tin foil so no air can get in and the butter cannot leak out.  You may want to double wrap in another piece of tin foil to be safe.  Throw the packet into the hot coals of a campfire.  In about 25 to 35 minutes, it will be done.  Be careful opeining the tin foil to avoid burns.    Enjoy!    Potsie Pies (That's what we call 'em anyway...)    Go to a camping store and buy some "sandwich irons) - they split in half to hold a slice of bread in each.  You use them to make pocket style sandwiches.    Loaf of white bread  Margarine or butter    Now, this is the fun part - for pizza, you can have any pizza ingredient that you want, like sauce, Mozz cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, green pepper, etc.    For Rueben, you need corned beef, sauerkraut, provolone cheese and thousand island dressing.    For dessert, you can use cherry, blueberry or apple pie filling.    I personally like chicken.  Dice and cook some chicken breast ahead of time and take it along in a ziplock bag.  Season it to taste (I like Cajun seasoning) and also some cheese.    How to make the sandwich...    Make sure your fire is hot embers and not a raging flame.    Butter two slices of bread on one side.  Take the sandwich maker apart.  Put each slice of bread in the half that's open  Buttered side to the sandwich maker.  Fill one slice of bread with indredients of your choice.  Careful not to get it too full  Close sandwich maker  They usuall have a handle lock on the of some sort.  Stick the sandwich maker in the hottest part of the fire  In about 5 to 7 minutes, you have a hot, melty meal!    WE love 'em!|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	http://www.thecampingsource.com/camping_...

Its an easy meal to prepare and gives you much energy with necessary carbs. Variations are mac and cheese, you can get powdered alfredo/pesto etc. Protien is necessary! Get summer sausage that doesnt need to be refrigerated. Even if it does, it can last a few days and be perfectly fine. Ramen extreme is always amazing when camping. Take ramen, and put it in a bowl with some powdered mashed potatoes and cheese. Pour the hot water over and let it sit till the noodles are cooked. Doesnt sound o appetizing now, but in the backcountry, it was the best meal i ever ate. You can make "backcountry thanksgiving". Mix powdered mashed potatoes, uncooked stuffing, powdered gravy and canned turkey. Pour hot water and let sit for a few minutes. These are always better than they sound in the backcountry. Just make sure you bring some veggies and you can add them to any pasta dish. But pasta dishes are always an easy, quick, and delicious meal.

Also this has really easy clean up, just use the tinfoil as your plate.    also, breakfast burritos are awesome, just make eggs bacon or sausage (or both) some cheese and wrap it in a tortilla You can always add salsa, or sour cream.     If you are up for a challenge try the orange cakes. Get an orange, cut a small hole big enough to get a spoon in on the top and scoop out most the insides then fill it a little under half full with cake batter (white cake batter works best, but others are good too). Wrap the whole thing in tin foil (make sure you keep it right side up) and then put it in the fire. It will be done when the cake mix is cooked.

FYd1ndVxaa	He holds the world's fastest serve record in modern tennis - it's near 249km/h. But his average first serve speed may not be the fastest among other players, but one of the fastest, the others include Ivo Karlovic, Sam Querrey, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Mardy Fish, Ivan Ljubicic, Amer Delic, etc. In every match, different tournament, their average first serve speed vary a little from time to time.  Roddick's average first serve speed is usually around 200km/h-210km/h.   The key to his powerfully fast serve is the speed of his shoulder rotation with the speed of his arm (racket) swing. He has strong rotator cuff muscle (a shoulder muscle) to do that, combined with the force he generates from the jumping off the ground when serving.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	It's his gift, I guess...|`|ClQ9yJweaa	Cause thats all he knows. he has never wanted to change up his speed to throw off his opponents, use some kick serves, and way too hyper. Thats the way he has played since youth and all he knows, which sadly for him, isnt enough to win championships as he was hoping and wishing for while growing up. Much too stubborn to have changed his game, and had plenty of time to do so. A top 10-15 player at best.|`|n29tt9chaa	Cos he sticks his *** out like he is taking a crap.|`|USY1XHfbaa	He is the fastest, but it seems as though American tennis players in general are just predisposed to serving fast. See: Roddick, Fish, Isner, Dent, Williams sisters, etc.|`|GombKA8Kaa	I agree with Hoo Roo Day.    It is the mechanics of his serve.    Technically he has great rotation, the force when he pushes up and forward from the ground (jump) and his snap of his wrist.|`|evFCon1Waa	he is the fastest server who has the world record speed but thats not why hes the best server it becuase every first and second serve is above 200km. thing is he has consistency i mean you might catch a arrow but his consistency makes his oppenet catch 70 arrows a match. now to go specific what makes his serve tick is his low toss, one of the lowest and somehow he has like the best serve so its not a coinsidence. now another thing is that while he tosses his arm is straght and  so is that side of the body while the rest of him is bent so hes like a total bow. now a small thing that he does is bend his playing arm and does that robotic arm lift while he does the throw and that slices the ball and when you slice that makes ball go in plus his robot motion u see is basic consistency that he perfected to hit similair speed every time. now adding it all together will equal to hitting a fast paced ball that goes in every time without slowing down and all hes got to do is use power. peace out|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Yes, he's the fastest server and holds the professional record for serve speed.  Why?  It's a combination of things.  Here's a technical article... http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors...|`|Lp2FNrb7aa	he serves fast because he is strong enough to do so! id say hes probably the fastest on the tour, but if hes not he wouldn't be far off. im pretty sure he also holds the record for the fastest serve, 244km/h or something like that... but i guess it may have changed by now|`|e9ARhomFaa	he is fast cause he obviously practised harder than the other guys.

PMluTf72aa	BJ Raji from Boston College is the most popular pick for GB in the first round.  he's the biggest DT, so he'll be the ideal NT for any 3-4 defense.  therefore, he's likely to go to GB as they are desperate for help in the middle of their DL.  he's about 330 pounds.  in order for the 3-4 defense to work, you need a big powerful NT to anchor the DL.  considering how none of the Packers DT's stood out last year, they will draft one.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	A.J.

(even Lebron averages 7 per game)   i mean, correct me if i'm wrong, but the main job of the PG is to run the offense and DISTRIBUTE the ball to the scorers...right?  well Mo Williams doesn't necessarily do that...certainly not by himself. half of the time i see Lebron bringing the ball up court.    guys like CP3, Deron Williams, Steve Nash, and Jose Calderon....these guys are clear point guards. you don't see them running around WITHOUT the ball. they are the ones who DIRECT the other players on the floor.  so as for MY OPINION....i do agree that Chris Paul is the BEST PG out there this year.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	No, AI, Billups, and Nash, J.

GombKA8Kaa	Hi Stephen C,    Unfortunately not anyone can just enter these tournaments.    You must start by registering with the International Tennis Federation as a player.    You need to play many tournaments around the world to gain a ranking to qualify you to be able to play in the tournaments like the Grand Slam.    it will take you a few years to do that, so I suggest you to practice for a few years play the tennis circuit to gain points and a ranking and then you can enter the big ones.|`|xUrEnxIGaa	First you need a racket and a ball, and of course the outfit.  Then fly off to Paris which is in France. Go to the tennis association and ask for the French Open form. Then fill it in. You will need to do this in French. Try and get there early and take a few lessons, This will improve your chances of winning.
RPXief0iaa	1) Apache Cat    2) Wilander    3) Weekend Hussler|`|nfZzdWGLaa	Tie between Weekend Hussler and Apache Cat I can not choose between them|`|zywy6vOGaa	Ok this is a tough one that i'm going to stay out of this race but because you want my opinion -    Weekend Hussler does not have the best first up record, and has actually not had a start over 1000m which worries me, also I don't trust Ross Mcdonald.    Apache Cat is very inconsistient, he does have a pretty good first up record and is unbeatan at the distance though.    There are some other pretty good horses and I think that anything could win this.    A horse that I would keep an eye on though is Seventh Rock. From Rock of Gibralter out of a Rubiton mare. Great sprinting breeding has raced four times over this distance for three wins and a third. First up for nearly a year, has a perfecrt first up record. Trained by David Hayes. This class may be a bit to high for him I think he's going to be a good one in the future and a horse that will place and give the others a run for their money.    So Weekend Hussler, Apache Cat and Seventh Rock, I'll probably just box this trifecta.    Good Luck to all having a bet.
vea6mqPZaa	It could be anything or anybody, just ask the range who the sponsor is. They may not want to tell you.    We add to a fund locally along with a few other companies that sponsor the "New Shooters" program at a local range.    The fund basically provides 2 ruger 10/22's and 3 bolt action 22's for the use of the local range and lots of 22 ammo.    Any child under the age of 16 is more than welcome to come shoot. If the child would like to come back, we put their name on the bulk pack of ammo. when the ammo is gone then they are required to bring their own.    90% of the time the kids come back with their own rifle and ammo before they use up the 500 rounds we give them|`|TEAKcA5Laa	my guess would be the nra. if your not a member, you should be.
Y4RS35M7aa	The 357 Sig is based on, and has ballistics matching, or at least close to, the 357 magnum, which is, according to things like the Strasbourg tests, and other effectiveness tests of handguns, the most effective "stopping" cartridge in the world.  Also, the FN, Sig, Glock, etc chambered in that caliber have a high capacity magazine.    See the discussion here, but don't forget that it's Wiki.  It's still an interesting discussion.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_po...    I went with the 40S&W for myself, though.|`|RSbn5STjaa	A .357 Magnum with a semi-jacketed hollow point has tremendous stopping power and is easier to handle than the SW|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	The .40SW would probably have more stopping power, but I would have to look up ballistics reports to give a really good answer.|`|aY6EjDwjaa	GET THE 357 mat DO IT NOW  if your looking for protection of course  if your thinking of muggin someone dont buy any XD  YAY GUN CULTURE (not really though)|`|o793tJyAaa	http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/s...|`|dbCkTKDxaa	357 sig|`|TPZwmQK9aa	The considerable research I've done has lead me to conclude that there is only one reason that the SIG would be superior.  That is, the round is famed for penetration of things such as vehicle doors, while not over-penetrating on human flesh.  Unless you are in law enforcement, where you might have occasion to have to shoot someone behind a car door, the .40 makes more sense.  Same size gun, very similar ballistics, much more ammo to choose from, and no worry that, as with the SIG, there aren't many .355 diameter bullets on the market that are made to withstand the velocity it creates.|`|803a466c10f04d50a006761a7ef5b803aa	Both are good cartridges, the .40 is cheaper to shoot and has a larger selection of ammo.    I have both and enjoy both.|`|CFm0u13Paa	Shot placement is more important than "stopping power".     .40 cal ammo is much more widely available than the .357Sig and considerably cheaper which equates to more practice and better shot placement.|`|TvARYVRJaa	the 357|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	The best .357 SIG has a 147 gr bullet @1225 fps, 490 fpe. The comparable load in the .40 is a 200 gr. @ 1050 fps, 490 fpe.  If you subscribe to the bigger bullet, bigger wound, go with the .40.   Another consideration is availability of ammo. The first site I checked didn't have .357 SIG.  Also price of ammo at Cabela's is $121.99 for 300 rounds, .40 is $92.99.  If price is no object, or you reload, take your pick.|`|AA11295048	njmotorcop is right.|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	They are both good rounds.  I'd take the .40 over the .357 sig because of the cost of ammo.

KJWxqQHiaa	1.) What is the best stocked trout bait?    I tried a bunch of nightcrawlers slabbed on a panfish hook, under a bobber and caught 1 trout. While people beside me fishing w/ corn were catching them by half-dozens (no joke). So, corn & nightcrawlers should be high up there.    2.) At the river or still at the dam?    Probably at the dam. They wouldn't leave that fast. Unless the water was just too bad for them to survive.    3.) What kind of powerbait?    Here's a link about fishing w/ powerbait, http://ezinearticles.com/?Using-Powerbai...  I don't know an exact color but, yellows & oranges are good, and berkley makes a pretty good kind.    4.) What is the best lure?    In-line spinners like rooster tails, mepps or panther martin's in 1/8oz. sizes are killer for trout. So, i recommend them.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	Most folks have the best luck with whole kernel corn on a salmon egg hook for hatchery raised trout.|`|r6zLN0Daaa	You cant go wrong with orange and the green power bait.

45M7V8aoaa	As long as its got full traceable service history and everything changed when it should have been changed (ie cam belt) it should be good for double that mileage. The early 2.0 TDI's had a faulty fuel pump so check this has been done, also if the ABS system gets faulty that can be a grand to fix, so give it a good hard braking test to make sure it all works and the ABS light stays out after.

AA11729094	Because it takes 12 lead balls the same OD as the ID of the barrel to equal one pound.     16 bore, or gauge, needs 16 lead balls the same OD as the ID of the barrel to equal one pound.

Also, the 5" or larger guns on Navy ships are called guns.|`|ky3B42f6aa	Technically speaking, a gun is the same as a cannon, i.e. no rifling [grooves]  in the barrel.  A rifle, by its very name, has a rifled barrel.  If you are talking about a modern "gun" on a modern ship, you really should talk of a rifled cannon.  Another mixup is between pistol and revolver.

This is incorrect nomenclature and aggravates a lot of type A personalities including all Drill Instructors no matter the branch or nationality.    Edit: someone on here tried to define pistols and revolvers and made a common error. Pistols are not clip fed semi-auto short barreled hand held fire arms. Those are more correctly referred to as autos for semi-automatic reloading. Pistols is the term applied to all (single) hand weapons that are fire arms. IE The Dueling Pistols of old did not have magazines. Revolvers are pistols, Autos are pistols, Derringers are pistols, and the old single shot flint locks of pirate movies are pistols.

The rifling is essentially grooves on the inside of the barrel that are designed to spin the bullet; increasing accuracy dramatically much like throwing a 'spiral' football instead of a tumbling football.  Rifles fire a single projectile (bullet) at long distances with great accuracy; depending on the caliber of the rifle.      Other types of guns include shotguns and handguns.  Shotguns are similar in length to rifles but they have smooth barrels since they fire many small pellets and don't need the rifling for accuracy.  Handguns; which includes both revolvers and semi-automatic pistols; are essentially rifles with really short barrels designed to be fired one handed.|`|VgUAIvEUaa	a gun is a weapon that fires a projectile (or a number of projectiles)  a rifle is a gun which uses rifling to spin the projectile    I got this from wikipedia which might help:  "Generally, the difference between a rifle and a machine gun comes down to weight and feed system; rifles, with their relatively light components (which overheat quickly) and small magazines, are incapable of sustained automatic fire in the way that machine guns are"|`|Y4RS35M7aa	A rifle has those grooves cut into the barrel that engages the bullet giving it that spin that increases accuracy so much.

BjGBz4Scaa	yes u can use paintballs in airsoft guns. they are obviosly smaller and more expensive. u will have to look closely to see if you are hit. here is a site that sells them http://www.frattoys.comproduct_info.php?...  have fun and give me the best answer lol u rock|`|JXMVNEQoaa	if an airsoft gun shot a bb .68 inches wide that would hurt like ****|`|jaAolejUaa	paintballs are too big for the airsoft gun...|`|ytNlz3b7aa	Yeah, sure. Just push the paintballs really really hard to stuff them in the magazine or barrel. Don't worry if they break and get paint all over the place. That's just part of the process.|`|SgKsHxD5aa	well, im not sure for all of them, but paintballs wouldnt fit into MY airsoft gun. others may be different tho...just dont buy anything expensive and see if it works i guess....|`|RX5t6x6Haa	expain how your gona get a .68 cal paint, into a 6mm barrel? yeah they make airsoft paintballs, but they more then suck, they'll jam in the gun and not break on the target, just spend a tad more (like $100) and buy yourself each a paintball gun, co2, and a mask and some paint) for like $150|`|Y4mz8BShaa	There ARE 6mm paintballs. All of them are poor quality though. They're all horribly manufactured, and only like to break on solid objects, not fleshy things like humans. Basically just on walls and inside your gun.    Airsoft works on the honour system. If someone cheats, a rifle butt to the face works quite well, as does spraying them with point blank with an AEG.    How bad would it be if you used them in ANY airsoft gun? You'll need to buy a new one.    Airsoft belongs in Other - Outdoor Recreation.|`|5628ec20b00d1a53d79e14cda6f420f9aa	NO- airsoft uses a small diameter plastic bb|`|OhMHSy9Oaa	You can find airsoft paint balls it really isnt that hard. just look for them where the aintballs or the airsoft guns are sold.|`|RIl5oMaaaa	i live in Gt Yarmouth and their is a air soft shop that sells the paintball bbs that will fit into an air soft weapon. They are the size of the standard bbs.|`|23oJf8mjaa	You can't use paintball bullets in an airsoft gun. You would have to buy a paintball gun. The guns are too different- the paintballs wont fit into an airsoft gun, you wouldn't be able to load them, and vise versa.|`|thCgYA5Jaa	well there are airsoft paintballs but i really dont recommend using them. they are pretty likely to break in the gun. I would just buy paintball guns if you have the money to buy airsoft gas guns.    www.pbnation.com is a very good website for used guns for great prices|`|ZA7qM4mvaa	you sure can, they really shoot great, thanks for posting here.|`|9wfmpBMWaa	When did paintball and airsoft  become a hunting topic.  I just don't understand.|`|uYOWTRtOaa	yes you can buy 6mm paintballs for airsoft guns
HsX4H0FLaa	Yes, it can.    The side-effects sheet mentions muscle weakness -   "Musculoskeletal System Disorders - Infrequent: arthritis, muscle weakness".|`|4gZYucHMaa	No infact most doctors encourage you to get active as there is proof in studies that exercising, gettting outdoors decreases your depression/anxiety.    edit--I went on Celexa after I lost my son, it *numbed* me and I couldn't feel anything mind or body so perhaps you're on too strong of a dose, or need to switch to another kind. I was on the lowest dose of Celexa and it still messed me up--I hated it. Doctors will tell you it's safe but I don't believe they are--there's a lot of side effects and altho I never found mine or yours on their list, there has to be some sort of connection.
f2TGzTGKaa	I manage fighters and I keep them on a training program at home as well as training in a gym. When you move to Ohio hit up Dragons Den..they are a no bullshit training camp and have fighters in big shows its a Mark Coleman gym. Before you go pro you need to do some ammy fights to see if mma is right for you. People who go pro right out of the gate end up screwing thier career with bad records. I manage fighters all across the country and currently have 8 in Ohio alone. When you move hit me up and I can help you out with your training.|`|vOOf7xdEaa	dont know sorry|`|kH4LeoAAaa	You seem to know what you are doing, and you obviously have some essential training gear. I would suggest you just doing your best to keep your endurance up before the move to Ohio. You can do this by getting one of your more serious friends to come over and pump you up during exercises meaning: Screaming at you, getting you going so you'll do more pushups, Saying things like cmon move move stop being a sissy! YOu get the point right. That way you won't be able to talk yourself out of doing a workout as soon as you feel tired, cause hey, thats what real trainers do right? Getting you worked, even when you are worked.    Good luck.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	like the person above me said keep up your endurance, and cardio.   this is randy coutures strength and conditioning work out i found online and it works wonders. use a barbell with about 35lbs on each side, and do all these without putting the bar down.     Bent rows x8  Upright rows x8  Military press x8  Good morning x8  Lunges x8 (each leg)  Squat push press x8  Deadlift x8    After the exercise is complete rest one minute then go again do at least 3 sets every time you do it and do it every other day.  you can find a video for this by seaching for couture work out    i also do other strength exercises after this one.    pull ups  plyo push ups for explosive power  sit ups, v ups,  sledge hammer a tire  tire flips about 30 yards down and back    do 3 sets of this along with the couture work out    other than that just do rounds on the heavy bag, and grapple with a partner if one is available. until you can get into a gym|`|qIa6m7pnaa	If you are seriously about this, turn this into a second job.   Treat it as such as well.   Work on your diet and exercise routine.   Build up a lot of core strength and cardio.  Do not build bulk.   Big muscles will slow you down.   Also when you find a gym take the second job aspect there as well.   When training do not go half assed.    Show discipline and do everything move until it becomes a reaction.    Also I do not know how young you are but do not fall for this "I am cage fighter ain't I cool" attitude.    I have seen a lot of fighters fall into this and they start slacking off and end up being carted out by medics.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	You should look into relocating. If that's your passion, and it's illegal in your state... Then, you know?    For $400 you can train at the MIlitech camp for a week and if it works out you can train there regularly, and just move there.    Also, you could move to vegas where Xtreme Couture is. I think a basic membership is only like $125 a month.

ClQ9yJweaa	I remember all too clearly for several reasons. First I had started collectign those Sprite cans my man Duncan was on and was saving them. Became a huge Spurs fan cause of him. AT same time was a big Knick fan, then ( Loved Ewing), and one of the best Finals personally for me, having my 2 fav teams playing. Especially Knicks upsetting the whole East during the playoffs.   If D'Antoni can get these guys to play some D, they could still get into playoffs in the weak East even under 500. They have plenty of offense, but without D they wont handle Boston, Orlando, Cavs and be a very short post season.   I used to like that Knick team and then thought Camby was under rated and should have been used more. Ewing, Sprewell, Oakley, Starks, man, miss those guys.|`|keUqPWVuaa	What "IF" I don't think the Knicks could have beat the Spurs in that series no matter what. Knicks fans see it one way, we se it another. Robinson actually was quite solid, but differed to Duncan who was the rising star, Elliot was killing you all with the deep ball. But Ewing would not have made the difference, the Knicks were over matched. It was a good series, but they were just a bit out-gunned. The only team that San Antonio has ever played in the Finals that has made it a REAL tough anybodies game fight was Detroit.|`|21J0IIZbaa	The lockout season.  The Spurs cruised  to a title by going 15-2|`|AsvVWfiHaa	i do recall that year quite well as a lifetime Knick fan.  for me it's all summed up by Allan Houston making the game winning shot against Miami (of all teams), and then running to the other end of the court to pump his fist in the face of some fools who were trash talking the entire game. that was FIERCE!!!    and you're right, we had a whole lot going for us that year...but unfortunately, not enough. i have to disagree with you on one point...Sprewell didn't get us by Atlanta by himself. Allan Houston played very well in that series too (he led all scorers in game 1 with 34 pts, and in game 4 with 19pts).    as for the similarities...i'm sorry, but i don't see it. i'm far from a fan of the defensively void coach (NO D)'Antoni, and his offensive schemes are only going to be a let down in the end.    we lost to the Spurs that year because they were clicking on ALL cylinders. we were severely outplayed by their bench, and their inside-outside game nailed the coffin shut. they beat us by at least 20 pts in 3 of their 4 wins....and Ewing could not have compensated for all of that by himself.  it's nice going down memory lane tho.  good stuff!|`|4DcvpQXfaa	i'm sorry    i just remember when they were lost in the game 5!    EDIT:yes the ONLY differences is what?    "i have duncan,you're not" LOL cool quote!|`|Z3bpKA2caa	I'm the exact same age as you. I remember that lockout shortened season had one of the more memorable playoffs in my memory. It was SO nice to see guys like David Robinson and Sean Elliot finally winning in the playoffs. Then on top of that there was the ultimate underdog story with the Knicks.    The Current Knicks are a clear leader away from being a legitimate playoff team. Hopefully they can pick up someone who would be their leader in the 2010 free agency even if it doesn't end up being LeBron. Donnie Walshe has the right idea clearing cap space. The Knicks future looks pretty bright.

Kobe will forever be superior to allan, should have stayed a piston, houston.|`|AA11488609	Nope, are you crazy?    As with the Knicks talk, they are capable of getting in the playoffs, and David Lee should be considered for the All-Star game.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	You're so Dellusional.    The NBA doesnt revolve around the Knicks, all your questions are so Biased for the Knicks. "Should David Lee be an Allstar", "Is Patrick Ewing the Best Center Ever", "Will my Knicks make the playoffs".    Very annoying.      edit: The Knicks are a Garbage Franchise, their fans boo at just about anything and everything *coughs* NBA Draft *coughs*. I hate to see the Knicks have sucess because of their fans dont deserve it.

EtEf098yaa	As as yankee fan, absolutely.  So far most of what i've heard i know already (is it a shock some players thought arod was overrated?  or that cashman signed players with good stats?  or he wasn't happy about not getting a multiyear deal from the yanks?  or everyone hated pavano?)       it seems like its completely overhyped but in the end most people will still read it and i bet most people think its a letdown.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	I loved that he pissed alot of ppl off because now he showed his true colors.I guess i'll check it out now that i know not only did he bash Arod but just about everyone who played on the yankees even Rivera,problem is i'm not sure if its going to be in the fiction or non ficton isle :)|`|TCehI17kaa	I probably will check it out.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I don't see myself buying it.

First off, as a Manager of a team, you have players confidence and they tell you things based on trust. Same thing with an Organization.  A trust he might now be betraying. Second, if I was a LA Dodger or member of that Organization, I would be careful what I said or did around him because again, I would not trust him. This may be over blown and nobody has read the book yet but if it is that bad, then he has lost my respect for sure!  I can't wait to read the book.|`|Ng0MKmxaaa	Yes.  I've got to see what all the fuss is about.|`|cxyLCoYraa	Maybe Maybe not|`|v7TXEzYhaa	Yes I will read it.|`|X9fo1IkKaa	Im going to buy it.

vXFpzKRaaa	If he wins this Superbowl I think he should seriously consider retirement and go out like Elway.  Go out on top and in class.  Don't be like this other QB that is still in the league that still thinks he can play at a high level when obviously he leads the league in INTS and doesn't have "it" anymore.  Warner seems like a classy kind of guy and I don't seem him pulling a Favre...  but then again a couple of years ago I would of said Favre was a classy guy too... now look at the guy.|`|AA10226964	No way|`|jLM4Yo32aa	Very good question, I think he should retire if he wins, if he comes back i doubt hes going to win another championship, and most players play to win.|`|JURTQAfgaa	First off, even if he loses he will still go into the Hall of Fame and I think he should stay one more year.|`|VhNmMWbXaa	I think he should.  There is talk that maybe the Bears or some other team might want him to try to make a run, so why not?  He's still got the ability, so why not play if he has a chance to play for a winner.  If a team like the Bears or Vikings signed him to a 1 or 2 year deal, I think he would take it.  Not for someone like the Chiefs or Raiders, but someone he could win with now.|`|ZImavV2Oaa	brett farve should f*cking retire, that old b4stard. he's gonna ruin his name if he doesnt.    yeah i think kurt should go too.|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	he won't retire.  even after he was let go by the rams and was backing up in NY and in ARI, he never gave up.  he's got too much of a competitive spirit in him and had said himself he felt like he had more to offer.  and he was right apparently.  but hopefully he will, unlike farve, know when the time is right and not make a fool out of himself.  you hate to see a good player make stupid choices.      i think he should give it another year and then see where he's at.|`|Zfbe0rYraa	he should but he wont, only because he loves the game far too much.|`|acaAycEXaa	Hell no! Who wants to be stuck with girly-man Leinart?    Some of you clowns are ridiculous! favre had one of the best years any QB had and finished 2nd for the MVP last year. This year he made the Pro-Bowl and was in the MVP talk until he got hurt. Not exactly washed up, ya think?|`|ePeKSqrIaa	No way hes still got it in him to play another 3 years or so. I don't see why he shouldn't|`|wjcK1h4caa	yea. I think he should. He would have made history in Arizona. Their first superbowl ever. He's had his time in the spotlight. If he wins this superbowl he might and should. I don't kno. It depends on his age|`|nZVKjJleaa	As a San Francisco 49ers fan I have seen Warner play against my team twice a season for the better part of his career.  Until now I never really had that great an appreciation for his skills.  I always thought he excelled in a 'system' chock full of superstars and a great offensive scheme.  That is, until now.  This guy definitely deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.  Sure, not many QBs have the benefit of playing with 2 all-pro receivers and a speedy 3rd WR on more than one team, but the QB has to bring it all together in this type of offense.  Hats off to you, Kurt.  You should NOT retire at the end of the year.  Keep playing for a couple more seasons, even if it means torching my favorite team twice every year.|`|GwawzO5Faa	It would be a great way to go out. Win or lose he should.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	"IF" he wins on Sunday...thats a big IF. But if somehow the Cardinals do win the Superbowl then yes Warner should retire. I think that would be good for the Cardinals too so that Matt Leinart could take over as their Franchise QB.|`|UA5L2SqXaa	Best way to step away from his pro career. Go out at the top.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	no way he should come back regardless. he could continue being a backup somewhere if nothing else.

But would definitely consider getting a Steelers one if/when I do get one.  Would likely just fit it into a bigger piece like an arm sleeve or something like that...
pDwQgwvRaa	I think your question should read, 'Can FSU again achieve national success under Bobby Bowden?'  He has reached the pinnacle in college football but has had some lean years here of late.  Bowden just signed a one-year extension which to me implies he is ready to hand over the reins to Jimbo Fisher.  I am an LSU fan (okay - give me a few negative votes) and watched Fisher coach under Nick Saban.  He is a good offensive-minded coach but he lacks defensive experience.  As long as he hires a good defensive coach who can assist him in evaluating and recruiting defensive players then yes he will do just fine.  FSU is having a good recruiting year but if you look at their roster they need to recruit more defensive players this year because the offense is set to roll.|`|JURTQAfgaa	Yes FSU is achieving a lot under Bowden and I think that he will lead them to the National Championship.
21J0IIZbaa	They still have time to turn around the season.  They will miss the .500 mark by going 40-42.|`|AA11488609	They are capable of beating most of the teams in March and April, barring another injury to O'Neal and somehow hitting .500.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	NO|`|yzY7W9yZaa	no and no playoff|`|JD5NQxeNaa	That's what they get from working the free agent marking to get aged players, like Parker and Moon - who have not played in the NBA to long as role players. Moon played in the NBDL and other nations  for nearly a decade as did Parker in the NBDL. They have aged if you wanted vet experience at least get vets that have been vets in the NBA and could do a lot.|`|t1uKdzmLaa	The Raps CAN reach .500 but I don't see it happening because of their major inconsistencies. I support those guys but I have to be real unfortunately.|`|LMGWEPBtaa	no|`|ClQ9yJweaa	There is plenty of time for them to reach 500 and beyond and think they will/can.  With Calderon back, and Bargnani picking up his play last several weeks, consistently, then of course Bosh, O'neal etc, I cant see why not and perhaps make some noise in the playoffs. They can be the "quiet upsetters". Only due to injuries, adjustments have they falthered, but clearly are a team to reckon with.

AsvVWfiHaa	maybe in a perfect world that would work....but the Knicks are absolutely set on letting him go.     as a native New Yorker born and raised in Brooklyn, i was beside myself with excitement when we signed Marbury. i mean it's always a dream for pro players to play at home...right?  BUT over these last couple of years, Marbury's antics (both on and off court) have lost him respect amongst his peers. what makes it worse is that he's not doing any damage control. he just keeps on talking and fussing.   it's bad enough that (NO D)'Antoni hasn't liked him since they were both with the Suns...but NOW??? he made it very clear from the beginning that he had zero intentions of allowing Marbury to play. it's just time for Marbury to leave if he wants to salvage wat's left of his career.  but in a perfect world....it sure would be nice!!!   LOL|`|t1uKdzmLaa	I don't think the coach would be that stupid enough to let that boy play another minute ever again as a Knick.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	they make play off with marbury?    if they can,why should they bring back marbury?|`|ClQ9yJweaa	Secret weapon? Too much of a distraction. That Coney Island bad boy ego he has, he needs to grow up. Hes not 19 anymore. Much too selfish and kills any team chemistry whereever he is. A team that acquires him will be most desperate, surely. His selfish, vain, immature personality has ruined his professional career and in time will realize the huge mistakes he has made.|`|qiCrVC5Saa	marbury, is done, the knicks can turn the page on him now and move on. He would be a distraction more than help.
Q3hOqlOTaa	I dont do fighting.    If there is ever a situation where someone would have to die for their club, football should be banned.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	LMFAO!!    Hell no, I'm not crazy. I would fight back if Im attacked by some other fans (as I did in Athens) but not with the intention of "it's ok to die for my club or to defend my club" and nor would I take provocation to begin an actual fight.    It's a sport. It's very important to me, Im passionate about it but you have to be psychotic to think it comes before family, relationships, friends and life itself.|`|VpiYSQVnaa	nope and anyone who would, doesnt have their priorities straight|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	football is an important part of my life but even fighting for it isn't worth it.|`|3yqCKPzVaa	haha no way! I'm not dumb!|`|7VwcvLTxaa	Erm, no.|`|Yb0182Vxaa	no|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	nope i don't like clubs to much pollution|`|NSFuIeZYaa	There is no way, they feel like family but if push came to shove and it was you re life or theirs I promise they would leave you standing alone|`|eG7pYnGxaa	Bloody stupid. Over a football team.    Maybe some people realise that the players and the managers of these teams dont give a sh*t about the fans. They go home to their mansions with swimming pools, super cars and model girlfriends and dont give fans a second thought so why should the fans give the greedy players a second thought?  Put it this way, if your team won the premiership, FA cup or Champions league, how do the fans benefit? By being able to brag that their team are the champions, thats all. The fans will still have to continue with normal life as soon as the game is over, work, nagging wives, money problems etc. So if people are willing to die for a football team that would never do anything or make any sacrifices for the fans, then the fans that would be willing to die must be thick as f*ck and have nothing worth while in their lives.|`|mvJXPDLgaa	no|`|AyHo8rnKaa	nope, I wouldn't get in a fight, just argue. when it comes time to fight, trust me, I am faster than Messi and Ronaldo combined.|`|cTaX7sFtaa	no i wouldn't, not if it would kill me|`|HkqiGEMuaa	Nope. I haven't joined a club anyway..|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Would you get yourself killed because someone slagged off your favourite supermarket?  Football clubs are businesses these days, pure and simple.  There's nothing noble about kicking a ball around for a couple of hours to earn more than most people watching will see in a year.  It seems a stupid and pointless thing to die for.  It's not like they'd thank you, or even care, If they knew.|`|1NwjxaVZaa	no not really cuz the clubs managers players dnt realize how much we care for the team|`|DMDYR6RXaa	I would fight for ma club but if it got too serious I would prolly run away.|`|a2ad32848d176ccd23fce84af9334c40aa	Um... No, I like United to a point.|`|rVHPjLfAaa	noooo... i would kick the wise @ss's butt and run away :P
F3VjJAdiaa	raw smackdown and ecw are all owned by vince mcmahon so i don't see the need to call them different "brands" i see it as wwe vs tna. obviously wwe is bigger then tna but tna is coming up in the world and i do like to watch their brand better then wwe. having said that, i watch all that is on tv.|`|JiCfYfLraa	man thats hard because both shows have great storyline so ill say uhhhh.......smackdown no no lol raw yea thats it raw lol.|`|RskPXtibaa	now both brand storylines better than last year  wwe is getting better|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I agree with the first user. I think both brands are solid right now. For a while, Smackdown was the better show, but Raw has picked up the ball lately|`|yKBsB4Dyaa	in wwe RAW and Smackdown brands have good storyline i don't have time to watch TNA thursday nights...  but if i had time i would of deffenetly watch it|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Raw and SD are even right now IMO...|`|BMDPdkdraa	WWE  (i hope TNA will have more ratings and than WWE will become more extreme and not extremely fake as its now)|`|94c52e622f8386f41ece9ca78c8861dcaa	I think that RAW has better storylines the charecters have more emotion bt the thing is SD! consitantly proves to be the better wrestling show    SD will get the rise in ratings the big names are on the show HHH the undertaker edge and more the only thing that is hurting it is it is pre taped and on friday if it was on thursday or wed or tuesday it would kill in the ratings maybe beat raw some weeks
aNnmH3R4aa	It doesn't matter!  I don't like his style of boxing!  Slow and it seems like he fights in slow motion!  It seems that all the hype he got after the fight with Cotto went to his head.  Even if he cheated or not....Mosley trashed him!!  Did you not see the knock downs?  IF he were to fight Cotto again....I wouldn't be surprised if Cotto won the next fight!      I like fighters like Barrera and Morales when they were in their prime....and right now my fav boxer is Juan Manuel Marquez.  I'll be hoping for the third fight between Marquez and Pacquio and have Marquez put a stomping on pac man!|`|SVmsA8MMaa	what is wrong with the mexican fighters  first oscar del la hoya and know margarito man that sucks  so bad it makes me so mad both lost their fights man that really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Mq21Qkyraa	No mammes  Dejalo en paz...Sugar Shane se lo putio bien feo.|`|7Xridrxaaa	haha Mosley is my favorite boxer because he is black but he fights mexican style. How cool is that? haha but idk if Margarito cheated. Cotto isnt that bad of a fighther either. If Margarito gets punished.. then oh well i guess haha|`|TovUBgidaa	okay well obviously your talking about the cotto fight. yes he is a cheater! he is NOT a true fighter! idk wat is wrong wit him. he is so STUPID! he cant fight. ouch! Hes all saying tht oscar is too old so he should retire and all tht. well wat about him? he should retire too before he makes a fool out of himself. he should be suspended for his life. he did cheat and so now here is the consequence. thts STUPID, DUMB! ugh!|`|81af62d312c580c0af445576215d2d5eaa	Why? Just because he lost to Mosley??? Mosley is a more experience and faster fighter than Cotto. Margarito can take a punch, but when he's taking 3x's the hits @ a time instead of the hits he was getting from Cotto of course he's going to wear down. All New Yoricans are just mad that another Mexican beat you guys! Face it, Mexicans have a better history in boxing than New Yoricans/Puerto Ricans! You guys have who? Trinidad & Cotto? That's it. We have Chavez, Duran, Margarito, Marquez, Morales, Barrera...and the list goes on! So quit hatting! This is what happened with Ali, Foreman, Liston! Liston beat Ali, Foreman beat Liston, Ali beat Foreman!!! It's the nature of the sport!!|`|CWTRdrQaaa	WTF are u gay, why are u kissing ure dad and posting it so evryone can see?!?!?!?!?!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?... thrse some sick dudes here in YA

UQLNP6iyaa	There are no vegans in the NFL. Have a sausage.    EDIT: gnab gib: I just like saying "have a sausage". There's a tiny little infantile part of my brain that gets titillated by that, especially in response to a patently stupid question. I also like saying "go on, you could get hit by a bus tomorrow, have a smoke". No offense is intended to you or Sir GaryE, I respect you both enormously.|`|a6EndAPiaa	I am a vegetarian so please do not be insulted when I say:  A Vegan bar?  Tampa Bay is *NOT* LA.  You might find a bar with vegan fare but there is almost no chance that there is a purely vegan bar in a city like Tampa . . . even Miami would be a long shot.|`|ZImavV2Oaa	the nfl does not cater to hippies. take your *** out to the bar b q it aint gonna hurt you.      now a serious answer......try the phone book?|`|mTSOJKlyaa	real people watch the NFl    and real people eat meat|`|2VGbJtnCaa	I don't know about that but there are some great steak places in Tampa!|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I'm a vegetarian, too. If you really were a vegan, you'd know that you're not going to find a "vegan bar." You go to a restaurant and order what you can from the menu.    Let me guess ... "All State Football Vegan" under a new screen name? When you guys retort with stuff like "have a sausage," that's exactly what he wants you to do. Don't fall for it.

I follow Kentucky and tune into March Madness quite a bit.     I watch the NBA every now and then... my only interest really is for my fantasy team. The players in the NBA just don't seem to care, they're all about themselves.      Hockey. Hockey is my second favorite sport and I love watching the games... the actual games though, I'm not into it for the fights. Go Redwings!     I follow the Detroit Tigers during the MLB season... but it's too long and boring to really keep into it...

But this is a radio call in show in New York.  You want them to talk about the Padres and Cardinals the same amount as the Mets and Yankees, since they are so non-biased?    He is doing his job.  He gets the callers riled up, either for or against his points, and they call in.  If he had no bias, what would they talk about all day?|`|4iQSHyScaa	He's being passionate because he's a Mets fan who wants them to sign Manny. He's a sports talk host, not a play by play commentator by the way, so he can be biased toward NY teams. It's fine that you don't want hosts to be biased, but that's the way it is if you listen to a local radio station. Maybe on ESPN they aren't biased, but it's much better to get locals discussing the local teams.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Lmfao I want him too :[|`|M0eyMvqlaa	I guess the media really wants the Mets to sign Manny lol. It makes sense though, he would be perfect for the lineup. That move would definitely put the Mets ahead of competition.(Let's Go Mets)|`|NdTy3twjaa	Your a Yankees fan that's why your annoyed.   Joe can say what he wants he's not insulting anyone he is making a point.   Mike and the Mad Dog helped convince the Wilpon's to get Mike Piazza back in 1997 so who knows what might come out of it.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Are you saying Joe Benigno likes the J' Mets? I haven't been listening, there's only so much J'Mets I take. He's over the top, and the shouting matches are annoying. He's just a fanatic fan ranting to a large audience.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Lmao I gotta admit I like listening to him and Evan Roberts, but I don't mind it,  he's not as bad as Mad Dog Chris Russo I mean that dude is 24/7 when it comes to the San Fran. Giants lol.|`|yk4S7uuraa	...a non-biased radio personality, like Francessa, this @$$w!pe does nothing but yap about Yankees all the time, but that's different I suppose.    Let Beningo talk about Manny all he wants, its his show. The one thing about NY radio is you have the choice to change to other similar stations, this isn't Butte, MT where there's only one station.|`|CHSIzFq9aa	he is a radio personality get over it change the station he i9s a good player the mets should get him. everyone is a big boy on the mets they should be able to have him on the team and not be distracted I think the dodgers dude gave him rave reviews.|`|wApoUG2baa	Its funny cause even Evan's going crazy about it.  I feel Evan rolling his eyes whenever Joe asks a question about Manny to someone.  Its really funny.    To your other point, who isn't a biased radio personality?  Evan is. So's Mike and the schmooze.  So's Sterling, and Mike and Mike on ESPN.  Thats definitely not a battle you're gunna win.|`|T5UBrKZjaa	That guys head gets larger everyday...hey Joe...remember your over-night roots @ FAN and stop worrying about your slicked back hair and GQ suits.     Enough with Manny....he's the greatest hitter...we all know...but he's a cancer and NOBODY invites cancer into their home. Remember Rickey Henderson !     Enough, enough, enough !!!!
6tGYe5roaa	They are all pretty annoying. I wold probably go with E as the most annoying. That is just immature and ruins someone else's time on here.    As for the baseball question, I'd have to agree with the others on Ted Williams.|`|3ULjjUNlaa	A's pretty annoying, but nothing I can't handle.    B is also annoying, but fun to give sarcastic answers too, along with A.    C is fun to answer because I LOVE to talk about the Tigers.    D is definitely up there.    E really gets on my nerve because people who try to spread there knowledge should not get reported and it bugs the living daylights out of me.    F, meh I'm going to say D-F    I'm going to have to say Ty Cobb would do really well in today's game.|`|WWT45CEzaa	The most annoying would be (E)   How fair back you want go   Shoeless Joe Jackson   Babe Ruth     just to name a few|`|tG5Ar7DIaa	E is the most annoying...Then A, then B, then C, then D.  To tell the truth, X doesn't really annoy me like he annoys others...I just ignore him.    Willie Mays.  Or Ted Williams.|`|Ng0MKmxaaa	A and C mostly but they are all pretty annoying.      I'm jumping on the Ted Williams bandwagon.|`|AA10672842	F. Although i'm not a big baseball fan I'd say Lou Gehrig because I think he should remember for more than having a disease named after him.  I read his record for 23 career grand slams was still standing as of 2008|`|AA10358665	B, I suppose.    Rod Carew. The man is the Ichrio and Vlad of his era... he could turn just about anything into a base hit.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Gotta be F, without a doubt.     AS for a player from the past, I would Love to see Bob Gibson throw some heat under the chins of these young cocky players. They'd start jawing and yapping at him and he'd do it again. Then they'd rush the mound, he'd beat the snot out of them and he'd still throw at them the next game he saw them. He'd do quite well I think since Pitching never goes out of style.     I miss being able to throw inside and actually have it mean something. Instead we get guys wearing armour and hanging over the plate like they own. Then getting hit, when they move in instead of trying to get away. (I.E. AJ Pierzynski)|`|ywYRId6maa	I would have to say F, I hate when people ask stupid questions, and X just annoys me.     I agree, and say Ted Williams|`|v9bTfQGMaa	F. All of the Above!    I agree, Ted Williams:)|`|AA11565799	E.  I have never blocked anyone because I don't like their opinion, even the Hamas supporters on News and Events.  I even have been blocked by a Tigers fan, for Heaven's sake.  I am a Red Sox fan.  I don't hide that.  Agree with me or not.  But don't block me for voicing an opinion, so I would say being blocked on a baseball board is most annoying.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Lmfao A thro F    & prob ted williams with that average|`|gVYfFSpRaa	F, they're all annoying, but I personally think that the worst are A and E.    BQ- I agree with Ty Cobb|`|gwUq6HMUaa	F..for sure!  BQ:I think Ty Cobb would absolutely destroy in this era. He didn't use steroids and look how good he played. Another I like is he played small ball.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	People who block & report you b/c your answer or opinion on a Baseball related issue is not to their liking even though they asked for your opinion|`|AA10554783	Questions by X & others like him.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	F  Orlando Cepeda- he was built like a bull, very good hitter. I have no idea why I thought of him, being a New York fan.|`|UoUaO52taa	E: Jerks are all over    As for the baseball question. Willie Mays. mThe greats can play in any era and Mays a 5tool guy and the greatest player of all time woould play just as well now    As for Williams, I think he could be even better actually being able to watch film on hitters. That said he'd have to learn to pull against the shift rather than being stubborn and trying to hit against it|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Good list, Scooter, but you missed:    -- trivia questions where the asker doesn't even know the correct answer;  -- poorly-phrased questions where the asker expects you to interpret what he was trying to say;  -- anything about Pete Rose;  -- utterly meaningless comparisons (e.g., Pete Rose to suspected steroid users);  -- obnoxiousness;  -- general nitwits.    Bill Bergen would hit no better in today's game, and still pull in a multi-million dollar contract.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Definitely A everytime I come in here it's one of the most frequently questions asked .|`|AA10349169	F    Mickey Mantle or Willie Mays|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	I get "E" an awful lot but I don't like surveys or Chipmakers ego (that's not my thumb down)    BQ - The Say Hey Kid|`|yjwQG6tXaa	F    A - Obviously no one knows  B - Same as A, obviously no one knows until the season starts  C - Just look at the persons profile or their avatar (like mine)  D - I blocked and report him and that Tom M guy.  E - I never try causing problems but the trolls always do it    Scooter, man you speak the truth and you are darn good at it. I respect that.    BQ: Babe Ruth he would pick apart all the average and below average pitchers in the game currently|`|utTFiz3gaa	F gosh those questions are annoying!    Roberto Clemente  Rod Carew ^^|`|4cJuKxJbaa	F definatly    I could see someone like Ty Cobb being a gutsy little guy...however if he pulled the antics he did in the past he would be banned from baseball! Stabing people & beating up fans would definatly get you in trouble...but he was one of the best ballplayer  there was for years!|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	F! All of the above.  A- Let me get my crystal ball - Brewers! Bet you didn't see that coming.   B- It's all about who's best on paper, I hate this question most. It dismisses my Brewers and that's not cool.  C- Milwaukee Brewers  D- Blocked and ignored  E- Hate them    I agree with Ted Williams
5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	yea maybe.. And to rhe answer above me.. what are you on??? The last three or four games dawson has played man of the match performance is is in excellent formm.. do you even watch football???  i think we are fine for defenders BUT we need a proper left back... maybe Nickey Shorey.... or a left footed left midfielder|`|HxET88bDaa	Yeah you're right...Serbia have the best up and coming players...ooops Man Utd are buying them all:D|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Nahhhhh   North's got lots and lots and lots odf good players.  (Better than east)|`|AA11109752	I'm a Chelsea supporter, but I think you guys should get rid of Dawson, he's rubbish.  You want a cheap European defender?  Neven Subotic of Borussia Dortmund and Serbia.  He's about 20 years old and will be one of the top 5 centre-halves in the world within the next 5 years, mark my words!    thessg.blogspot.com|`|c1wYc2syaa	You talk a lot of sense, and i agree dawson has been playing exceptionally well and he deserves to make Ledleys place his.
yJ8DqPA0aa	R Alomar of course.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Alomar. I dont think Morgan will ever be known for his defense more for hitting|`|iPWKzzQtaa	Alomar is obvious, he had much better range. Omar Vizquel made Robbie look even better, when Robbie played with the Indians.    I don't downgrade Morgan that much. Since Robbie was about the best ever...Joe Morgan would probably be in the Top 20.    If picking a team...Alomar, because he could bat lead off or 2nd.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Alomar. Because he was. That and I really can't stand Morgan. I used to respect him before I had to listen to him run his mouth when he started broadcasting. Now I just wish they had the ability to kick people out of the Hall of Fame, just so I wouldn't have to listen to him remind me that he is in the Hall of Fame, every five minutes or so.|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	Peter Beaters.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Alomar, not even close.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Felix Millan was the best second baseman.|`|Mqurv3LXaa	Roberto Alomar was a brilliant fielder and hitter.  The tandem of Vizquel/Alomar would turn games around with their offensive and defensive excellence.
zbjF53nraa	It all depends, on smackdown, there aint so much storyline and rivalry it is just good ole' wrestling. Raw is more storylines and rivalries so its for people that like soap opers type things, and smackdown is just for people who like wrestling. I like Raw better because Shawn Michaels is my fav and plain old wrestling starts to get boring|`|RskPXtibaa	RAW is best for only one reason  it only made WWE what it is today  because raw only competed with wcws nitro and it only made vince a billionere and all best superstars are and were in RAW once  and WWE's RAW only made wwe what it is today|`|WCX6kYITaa	Vince is pushing both brands now with the Orton [kicking Vince storyline] on Raw and the Matt vs Jeff storyline on Smackdown. Overall though, Vince favors Raw that's why big storylines involving him always occur on Raw.    Smackdowown has the greatest superstar (Edge), the great Shelton Benjamin, the joint-best Diva (Maryse) and the best GM (Vickie). But it also has idiots like Chavo, Kendrick, Ezekil Jackson, the aweful McCool, untalented babe Maria   Raw has the awesome Jericho, the brilliant Orton, joint-best Diva Beth Phoenix. They also have other great "under-heels" viz. JBL and Regal and the Diva-cutie Mickie James and funnyman Santino.     Smackdown has two of the "uber-lame-asses" of the WWE (Jeff and HHH) and so does Raw (Cena and Fatista).     Smackdown has the single greatest individual in WWE (Edge) but overall Raw is ahead.|`|xmj1HGTBaa	I think Raw has the better story line.|`|xnhBucrjaa	raw is the better show. it has most of the top superstars and the best story lines. plus if you notice vince only goes to raw.usually.|`|eMAIGsPoaa	I think right now Smackdown is the top brand. Firstly Jeff Hardy is the most over face in the WWE and I expect Matt to draw some major heat after his recent turn, as he was already an effective heel in the Mattitude era. Smackdown also has Edge who is the best heel in the business, only Jericho is even in contention. And finally Smackdown is a show that is free of John "super" Cena.  I don't really dislike Cena I just can't stomach watching him overcome insurmountable odds anymore.|`|zeIQRq6Paa	before the last draft it was easily raw but what you need to do is look at how many of the big stars are on which show, there is batista cena orton hbk y2j jbl and so on, that means that raw is the weakest brand in the eyes of vince.  the reason i say this is because cena and co were used to boost smackdowns ratings and vince has said he wanted to try and improve raw's fanbase by using cena.  i still perfer raw because im old school but i was really gutted to see trips and JR go over to smackdown and we get that sucker cole. the story writing for both has gone a little weak recently. would like to see y2j being a bit more of a ammusing heel. some how the writers made him boring. for technical wrestleing its smackdown   hhh big show mvp edge and the gold standard are considerd the best in the wwe.  for the bigger stars and slightly better story lines its probaly raw but its more personal choice to decide which is better|`|wM9D9w8xaa	Well.. I have always preferd RAW.. But, Since the 2008 Draft Smackdown has taken over.. Since Jeff, Triple H etc. Has moved to Smackdown I think there has been better roster. . But its not just the roster thats good.. The storylines are also better.. Coming into the Jeff & Matt story now is gonna be very interesting & also how they bring back Christian . . I know RAW has good 1s aswell like the Randy & McMahon situation but from my point of view Smackdown is better :) x|`|fJhVPz3Haa	raw  because it has better superstar like orton jericho punks mysterio kane     AND USUALLY VINCE COMES ON RAW AND RAW HAS A BETTER STORYLINE INVOLVING LEGACY ORTON RHODE AND DIBIASE|`|JiCfYfLraa	i have to go with raw because the fans are more live and the action is just more hyped. raw has some of my favorite superstars like randy orton,chris jericho,cm punk,kane  and shawn michaels.|`|KIOR56r6aa	RAW is a lot better. SD! good matches is only Undertaker and mid carder matches, the main event involving HHH and Kozlov is no different from a snorefest.|`|8t1Osybyaa	raw cause its live  and im always excited to see it unlike sd which is taped i always read spoilers and know what happens raw is the best|`|TWQNYhVVaa	I'd have to say RAW,I like smackdown it's just kinda..meh,boring half the time,Raw has it boring matches but most of them are good,they have a lot more of my favs,CM Punk,HBK,RKO,plus a little better storylines I think..|`|8Im1iGFTaa	RAW they are live, have all the star power, and the mcmahon orton storyline|`|YhfMrppSaa	Smackdown, Raw has Cena and batista who gets title shot always, and making raw boring this day's back then it was fun.        SD has Taker, HHH, Edge, and Big. S. couple great superstar then raw does.      Raw has top star like HBK, and Orton        Cena and batista no offense, sory, but  they are boring.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	Smackdown.|`|LfWghJYeaa	In my opinion raw is better just cause of the fact they way more a list superstars and Raw is Vince's baby so you need that he is making raw  the best on purpose.|`|1MQRfEgSaa	Smackdown ... They have the Undertaker , The Big Show , Triple H and they got HARDY so id go with SD   SD is much more entertaining than RAW ,  TV Ratings will also go for SD   So SD rox
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	1)  There would be a bigger disparity between the top and bottom of the standings    2)  There would be a bigger disparity between how much the top team is spending compared to the bottom team    3)  While I'm not convinced that free agent signings would have been vastly different team wise...........I'm sure the money would have been bigger.    For example.............Drury and Gomez would probably still be Rangers, with more money.  Briere would probably still be a Flyer....with more money, etc.  Hossa would probably still be a Red Wing, but they would have given him more money because Lidstrom would have gotten more, Datsyuk, etc    The one thing that would be different is there would be less talk about whether or not a team could be kept together.  In Detroit and Chicago's case the answer would be 'yes', and in Pittsburgh and Phoenix's case, the answer would be no (In a no salary cap league, there is no way that Pittsburgh would be able to sign EITHER Crosby or Malkin when their RFA came up as teams like Montreal, Toronto, Detroit, Philly, NYR....would offer them more than Pittsburgh could match - even with their new arena)        Awesome Bill   - teams wouldn't go under - they just wouldn't be competitive (by choice).  Phoenix was in better financial shape before the lockout because they had a $23MM payroll.  Now that they have to be at $40MM+, it's hurting them.      Bill  Point Taken, and I think relocation would be the most likely option|`|VC5mEULTaa	The Leafs would have triple their current salary and still suck|`|kOcBfbRraa	I think the bigger AND BETTER question would be..........How great would the nhl be if midget bettman never came to it?|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	It would be the Original Six and a few other teams like the Flyers, Ducks, Stars, maybe the Pens competeing for the Stanley Cup.|`|UoUaO52taa	It'd be like MLB where the rich stay rich and the poor can't move up|`|VjAoRpIhaa	it would be like baseball. the teams that have the most money in baseball, like the yankees, can sign all the good players, and the teams that are doing bad in finances, like oakland, cant sign good players, and it will stay that way|`|lYnkvRASaa	The Leafs would be sitting in 8th place contemplating bringing in one more old overpriced has been at the deadline.    The wings would have both Zetterberg and Hossa under Long term deals.    Sundin would still be a leaf    We'd be talking about the Leafs and rangers breaking 110 M in payroll|`|VRLs50xsaa	I dont watch too much hockey but its easy, it would be like the mlb where there are rich owners who just have dominant teams to get whoever they want every year i.e. Yankees, Red Sox, Dodgers etc. And then there will be other teams who cant afford star players and it takes them a long time to actually accomplish anything as a team|`|AA11674745	I would expect some teams to be going under because of the disparity of financial resources. For better or worse, the salary cap is a much-needed lifeline for the NHL teams.    We'd probably have to hear more about Foppa's return to the league, franchise free agency, and teams from the smaller markets making it to the Finals because they do a better job with less money. The Red Wings being the exception to that rule, of course.    LITY - Your point about Phoenix is valid and well taken, but I contend that because of the disparities in revenue earning and spending we both have mentioned, coupled with the current state of the economy, the "unhealthiest" of teams would have to be strongly considering lucrative deals to relocate or worse, face disbandment. These "what-if" scenarios do allow for a wide margin of interpretation.|`|VvYNeqcIaa	The reason the CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement) was put in place with a salary cap included was so that teams like your Coyotes can compete against the big boys like Detroit and New York. If there were no salary cap I 100% guarantee there'd be no team in Phoenix this year. And also around the rest of the league. There would of been teams that folded already like Atlanta,Tampa Bay and Florida. While teams like Montreal, Detroit, New York(rangers), and Toronto would have AllStar teams and the smaller market teams would struggle. The way the NHL is set up now your team is rewarded for good scouting, teaching and development and being able to access talent. Also you need to make smart trades, wise signing of free agents and good money management. It makes the General Managers of these teams more responsible.|`|UADHt07Zaa	The Wings would have Hossa and Franzen under long term contracts.  The Habs would have signed Mats Sundin and traded for Vinny Lecavalier already.  The Rangers payroll would have topped 100 million by now.|`|94C2U5FLaa	red wings would own! hahaha im a hawks fan but they have such a good team this year!|`|6KZgeq3Maa	Players salaries would be ridiculously high (like in MLB) and you would have the same few teams in the Stanley Cup hunt each year while the smaller market teams will be happy just to field full teams and make money.|`|fB4RfiCgaa	The rangers would be a lot older, and the Sabres would be a glorified AHL team|`|IznMkOvmaa	check out the Yankees in Baseball   Big Market teams would have all the talent and then the small market teams (FLA teams, Atl, phoenix, etc...) would not exist anymore making for a better NHL    Just get rid of the SE division
JiCfYfLraa	they are ok but i dont think they are good enough to get wins over victoria and natalya. they are not even in victoria and natalya's league thats what makes me sick about the wwe. they are decent thats it nothing too special. i cant say if i really love them or hate them because they havent impressed me yet. the wwe is making them out to be some kind of goodie goodie superstar divas when they are not.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Love 'em. Whats to hate about them? Nothing|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	I hate them, they bring even more disgrace to the womens division, just like kelly kelly|`|2rJwgk40aa	dont love em,dont hate em.I dont see what the big deal is about them.They really dont impress me with thier wrestling abiltity.|`|0KN8bX3Daa	Hate is a very strong word, but I must say I do not prefer them because they're very boring and lame. Maybe if given a better storyline I would like them but for right now they don't entertain me. Sorry!|`|vyHwhACjaa	Well "hate" is a strong word but the question you need to ask yourself is would either of them have been hired on their own as singles competitors? No. In other words they're just a gimmick and another blow to WWE's women's division.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	I haven't really seen or heard them enough to say one way or the other..I guess like em right now..|`|BMDPdkdraa	i love the  there is no reason to hate them  and they have some nice gimmick|`|PylZ74Z1aa	their hot  but i prefer gail kim , i will never watch the wwe again if gail kim is forced to lose to the bella twins.|`|1MQRfEgSaa	I don't like them ,   They look kinda boring , they're weak and they're not entertaining|`|YhfMrppSaa	Love, and love|`|c4945703897699a06e7537baffebe49caa	If they stood by the ring for us to look at, love 'em, but to watch them wrestle, no thanks.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I don't think i've ever seen them on tv, but it sounds like another lame gimmick to show women on wrestling.
LEQowzHCaa	I also think the Red Wings will have a big second half of the season. They have a lot of players who have the potential to play a stronger game. Datsyuk, Zetterburg, Lidstrom and especially Chris Osgood. He has struggled but I expect him to play a lot better. Ty Conklin has been dominant so look for him to have another strong second half.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	Price     I think it will be Vancouver|`|DvBPLP4saa	The Penguins. Because last night I caught a small sight of the team I remember.     .....Plus, I can always dream. :P|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	St.Louis Blues and the New York Islanders they can only go up from where there at.|`|UoUaO52taa	Pens. Tehy're a better team than their recrd indicates. They could still make a move at the deadline and Gonchar should be back in March    Vancouver: Sundin will start producing and if Luongo gets hot lookout|`|VjAoRpIhaa	florida and carolina. i see them both making the playoffs and not almost not making it|`|iMcjcPBbaa	THE SENS!   Nah, i'm just being optimistic though!|`|eXYY6qDtaa	Senators - They have alot of potential, just their main scorers and point giver's ( Spezza, Heatley, Alfredsson ) aren't really doing much right now..    GO SENS GO.|`|VvYNeqcIaa	There are 4 teams that come to mind all in the Western Conference that will surprise alot of teams in the second half. Two of them are teams that should make the playoffs for the first time in a very long time. The Phoenix Coyotes and Chicago Black-hawks are two teams that have been stock piling young talent from the draft after so many bad years. Both will be very hard to eliminate in a seven game series in the playoffs this year. In the end it comes down to goal tending. Phoenix may not have the horses or experience to go deep in the playoffs but Chicago definitely could surprise. The other teams hiding in the weeds are Calgary and Vancouver. Calgary is a very rock solid hockey club with 2 lines that can score. While the other 2 make playing difficult. Excellent goal tending and a rock solid defense. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they upset one of the big boys. The Canucks are a bit of a reach. But if Sundin can find a way to gel with his new team they also have all the ingredients (scoring, defense and goal tending) to wreak havoc in the second half.|`|94C2U5FLaa	the Red Wings already had an awesome first half! how can they do better?! I think the Hawks and the Lightning will have a great turnaround!|`|lVOkCSbyaa	Dallas Dallas Dallas. People forget about Dallas. Avery is behind us, Turco finds his game more and more each outing, and the IR is getting shorter. Everyone bet against us last year and look how we did, I'm glad people are against us now so we can go out, play our game, and turn heads. GREEN AND GOLD FOREVER!|`|s9Fjj9A2aa	Florida Panthers I think are going to have the best turnaround, they have already been turning it around.    Also agree with the Dallas comment. They could be solid without morrow.    And maybe Tampa Bay? Lol nahh... go sign another 30 players this summer and maybe they will?|`|AA11196555	One team I love(Minnesota) and one team I hate(Vancouver, well, until they get Patrick White).  Both teams have amazing goalies.  I think Vancouver will be better down the stretch of the two because they have more consistent scoring.  It will be interesting if Minnesota gets Marion Gaborik back for the final month of the season.  I guess I'd throw Pheonix in the mix too, a ton of great young, fresh talent should prove successful for the 'yotes.|`|sVg0O0Jcaa	The Lightning. They started the season horribly but have recently started to turn the corner. I thought I heard they won 7 of the last 10? Doubt they'll be in a position for a Cup run though.|`|qH4svuCIaa	pens, crosby has been out, their net minder has been swiss cheese... they are too talented to miss the playoffs... and it kills me to say that|`|IznMkOvmaa	dallas and Vancouver  Both goalies are going to get back to form and Sundin is going to start clicking for Vancouver|`|HNEWf7ILaa	My Columbus Blue Jackets!

7e779664f2fa69c81d06551c999ec10baa	Hmm.....So there are no Red Sox fans in Fairfield County, but there is a Red Sox bar in NYC.  I guess only Yankees and Mets fans patronize their establishment.  Interesting.    http://www.sheckys.com/newyorkcity/searc...    Here are a few words from Joba about Lester during this Hot Stove meeting at Sacred Heart University:    Chamberlain was unabashed in his admiration for Lester, who overcame cancer to have a breakthrough year for the Red Sox in 2008, going 16-6 with a 3.21 ERA, including a no-hitter against the Royals and a shutout at Yankee Stadium.    "It's an honor to appear on the same stage as him," Chamberlain said before the program. "He's done things in baseball we'd all like to do, like pitch a no-hitter, but what he's done in life is much more important."    http://www.courant.com/services/newspape...|`|39d2f170b7ab29e80de1d05e4c44248baa	Yes, Heaven forbid a Professional athlete with an inspiring story of overcoming Cancer should make an appearance to kids...

5xIroQjMaa	Forever loyal is a thing of the past. I can only name three marquee players in recent history that were forever loyal. Gwynn, Mattingly, and Ripken. That said, the Cardinals are a franchise with a proud history, and fairly good ownership.management from the top down. I wouldn't be surprised to see them rebuild a quality ballclub before Pujols contract is up. Now whether they can still afford him at that time is another question. I'd give it a 50/50 chance right now. We'll see exactly what Pujols is about though....the game or cash. He deserves big bucks, and can easily score the fattest contract ever (topping Arod), but he might not want that.|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Well he's already making $10 mil a year now. He's pretty much a local as he lives in St. Louis year round and he has family in Kansas City also. Albert has been talking and referring his stats to life long Cardinals like Stan Mussel, I think they've already got a mold for his bronze statue to stand beside 'Stan the Man'.  If the Cards offer him anything salary wise for a franchise player on a mid-market team he'll stay in St. Louis. But the Cards are cheap! So who knows.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	I'm going to guess the Mets.  Delgado is getting a little long in the tooth (though he had a good season in '08), and the Mets are one of the few teams that will be able to put up the $30 million/year it'll take to sign him.  The Yanks wouldn't bat an eye at offering Pujols the money, but they have a great first baseman already.  The Sox might give it a shot, but I can see them going after someone a little cheaper.  I think the Dodgers won't go into that kind of salary range for any single player.  When all is said and done, he'll make more money than at least one MLB team combined.|`|CO2o0YYMaa	I'm a Cubs fan and I say he will forever be loyal to the Cardinals.|`|cnssh7v3aa	He will remain a cardinal for now but if he ever goes anywhere, the tigers should get him :)|`|8RQifraJaa	I don't think that the cardinals would allow him to go to another team. Once his contract is up they would pay him as much as he wants. He has been a model citizen and the face of the franchise. Just like the yankees did with derek jeter. He's one of the highest paid players but his stats don't justify the yankees paying him that much. They did because he is a great leader and he is the face of the yankees.|`|h074DM42aa	Honestly, he sets the standard for class.  I just can't see him heading in the direction of several other big names (not the least of which is A-Rod).    Having spoken with him prior to a deployment with the Army to Iraq, he was very level-headed and seemed to understand that there is more to life than huge contracts and hype.      He isn't about hype.  He likes St. Louis.  He loves St. Louis.  And St. Louis loves him.  There'd be a revolt if he left.  Of course, I can't see him leaving, either.      He's bigger than the others and understands loyalty.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Hell always play for the cards, the yankees have tex they dont need him. Id love for him to play for the mets but that would never happen|`|iPWKzzQtaa	I think he is already clearly one of the best hitters in baseball, if not already the best..some might say Manny, but it's really close.    I think the Cards would keep him..going up to a multi year deal of 20 mil plus per year..not 30M. My personal opinion is that Albert would stay put in St Louis, declining the extra money.     Being an icon in St Louis is better than getting mega millions in NYC. The fans in St Louis wouldn't turn on him in case of a mini slump..whereas in NY, if the team didn't win as expected, Albert might hear about it more.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	that dude is going to get a career ending injury this spring training, to which the Yankees will still trade for him...I looked it up in the Mayan calendar.|`|EtEf098yaa	He isn't hitting free agency.  I can see the Cards swooping in and offering him close to what Mart Tex got from the Yanks before his contract's up.  Possibly even more depending on his next few years and his recent injury problems.  All in all he's the best player in baseball, and I can't see the Cards not doing everything they can to keep him (and it doesn't seem like he wants to leave either).|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	I dont think he will go anywhere, the sad case is that the management is too cheap to get him some other players that could make him and the organization see alot more rewards(mvp,ws) at Busch. I could see him saying something to do the management, I hope he does real soon.|`|utTFiz3gaa	Pujols should/will/must be a Cardinal forever lol i don't see him in any other team than the Cards... kinda like the Jeter and Yankees thing... And Pujols is so classy wish i had MLB tv or something so i could see him more often (seriously the only way for me to see other teams is to watch Dodger games)    It sure would be empty without either of them on the team ^^|`|FJzR3YaTaa	I have watched Albert throughout his career with the Cards and I think we will move to a larger market. I have a strong feeling that he will eventually go to the Redsox. That is one position that they are lacking a dominate player at. He can hit and he is known as one of the top defensive players in the league. So, I think the Red Sox would be a perfect fit for him.

4TgxrCX4aa	Funny you should ask, I have a story for my reasoning:    On the first day of school a first grade teacher explains to her class that she is a White Sox fan. She asks her students to raise their hands if they, too, are White Sox fans.  Wanting to impress their teacher, everyone in the class raises their hand except one little girl.  The teacher looks at the girl with surprise and says, "Janie, why didn't you raise your hand?"  "Because I'm not a White Sox fan," she replied.  The teacher, still shocked, asked, "Well, if you are not a White Sox fan, then who are you a fan of?"  "I am a Cubs fan, and proud of it," Janie replied.  The teacher could not believe her ears. "Janie, why pray tell are you a Cubs fan?"  "Because my mom is a Cubs fan, and my dad is Cubs fan, so I'm a Cubs fan too!"  "Well," said the teacher in a obviously annoyed tone, "that is no reason for you to be a Cubs fan. You don't have to be just like your parents all of the time. What if your mom was a hooker and your dad was a drug addict, what would you be then?"  "Then," Janie smiled, "I'd be a White Sox fan."

And the reason is because of T-ball pictures as a 4-year old.    When I was 4, we had to go to a building to get our pictures taken for T-ball, you know, team pictures, and also an individual one. For the individual picture, we could choose between a Wrigley Field background or a Comiskey Park background (it was called that at the time). Everyone was choosing Wrigley, and I "felt bad" for Comiskey and chose that. Only one other person chose Comiskey. So to this day, I am still a fan of the Chi-Sox.

I think the top 4 teams in England are better than the top teams in any other league.  While I do think the Premiership is the most exciting, I don't like the style of play very much, outside of the big 4.  Look at Bolton or Stoke for easy examples.  All they do is turn each game into kickball; Stoke especially likes to rely on a long throw in to win matches.  What is up with that?  That kind of play should only exist in Scotland.  I like to watch La Liga because even the average teams play good technical football, which is what I like to watch most of the time.  For that matter, my top 3 leagues in the world are La Liga, EPL, and Serie A...in order.

oYf3jSq6aa	Wrong Pedro  There is no federal law that sets a minimum age to own handguns at 21    Pa sets the minimum age to own firearms at 18 and does not distinguish between handguns and long guns  So yes because there is no law against it it is legal for an 18 year old to own a handgun in Pa      http://reference.pafoa.org/statutes/PA/1...    Panama Joe  That is because it is illegal for a federally licensed dealer to sell handgun ammo to someone under 21, just as it is illegal for a licensed dealer to sell a handgun to someone under 21  There is no federal law that prohibits private transactions of either handguns or handgun ammo for non licensed individuals|`|Y4RS35M7aa	When I worked at the gun store in PA, we used to ask young-looking people who wanted to buy ammo, "Is this for a carbine, rifle, or handgun, because if it's for a handgun, we have to say 'No.' "   Naturally, they'd say it was for a rifle or carbine.    This leads me to believe that you can not have a handgun if you're under 21.

Now if you have a handgun carry permit and your dad says you can carry your gun today and you shoot somebody YOU are responsible. Not your dad. Go to www.gunlaws.com That should help you out.|`|AA10702710	bferg got it right again.    I am originally from PA and I used to hunt with a handgun at the age of 18.  In fact, I had a handgun hunting permit issued to me at the age of 18 (had to have a different one for each handgun I wished to hunt with and it had to be purchased annually).    But, to purchase a handgun or handgun ammunition, you have to be 21 years of age.|`|VaxIN5oIaa	18 u can own  21 u can purchase|`|WBGnXsr7aa	It is perfectly legal to hunt with a handgun in PA. At 18 as for owning one, No you do need to be 21 to be completely legal. (registered in your name) Call a PA gun shop see if I'm wrong. To OWN is just that it means it is registered in your name the only way to do that is thru an FFL. A handgun not registered in your name is legally not YOURS. You can be in possession of one yes but not OWN one. A private sale is not inheriting a firearm. So you are wrong as well vanigon. However catholic if you get yourself caught with one while doing a side deal, all I can say is good luck to you if it's not legally registered to you. It's not hard to report a stolen weapon. Also when you do turn 21 and go to register the weapon in your name, just say the person moves and you dont know where they live, then what? You need both parties to do a transfer.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	There is a federal law restricting gun dealers to only sell to persons 21 years of age or older. However, each state sets it's own age limit for handgun ownership.     In PA you can own a handgun at 18, but you can't buy it at a gun dealer. It could be given to you, or you could inherit it.

mTSOJKlyaa	alright thanks for posting something that isint even a question|`|I2I843Myaa	Like you said, no weak teams, it's anyone's game, we'll see.|`|GwawzO5Faa	I think it's more about wanting the Cardinals to win. The Steelers won one a few years back and a lot of fans in general would like to see a team that hasn't won one win one.|`|KNTofuxMaa	Why even play the game? They should just crown their asses right now.     Steeler fans have taken over the top spot of most obnoxious fans. At least you all are the best at something.    Gangrel... could you please post your source for the "facts" you claim? And for the record... the cowboys sell more merchandise than ANY other team. That may or may not indicate the biggest fan base but, it seems likely that it does. Thank you and God Bless!|`|xGofrX5Iaa	I don't know what's worse Steeler fans or cowgirl fans. They might win 6 championships, but the ones they won in the 70's should be thrown out since everyone was doing steroids on their team.|`|KhBmlaefaa	I agree. The Steelers are by far the better team. The offense is not as great as Arizona "should" be, but the defense is so much better than that of the Cards. Overall just a lot better squad.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	hahaha, likewise for doubting the cards.|`|xO2fDqklaa	I doubt the Steelers. The Cardinals are better. Im from AZ and i have been a diehard fan since 1988. They will beat the Steelers 31-30.  Go Cards!|`|355232ca109d88be6fb23e594e9e9813aa	Well Bam Bam, I wouldn't say we're the most obnoxious, just the most numerous. After all, the Steelers have the biggest female fan base of any team in the NFL. I am a born and bred Steelers girl, raised an hour north of Pittsburgh. I recently moved to Bills country, but we've gotten quite a few ppl to jump ship and come over to the right side, black and gold that is.     But oh yea- Tomlin and Roethlisberger are on their game, and with all the good ole' boys being back in time for the game, it will be an awesome game, and victory XD    Here we go, Steelers, here we go, Pittsburgh's going to the Super Bowl!|`|y4lCDAZOaa	Those chicks ROCK!!!    Bam Bam, don't be mad cuz you guys can't even beat Utah.    As for the Steelers, first team to win 6 baby!!!!!!|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	So you find it amazing that someone might have a different opinion than you.  Wow.
awfhKRPtaa	Steeler are going 2 ge beat  in a stunning upset for the Cards!!!!!!!  27-21|`|tPTse1tLaa	Cardinals are going to win! :)|`|AZlAw2r7aa	well cardinals have other players who are good too like boldin and pope  i think they are both really good teams and they are doing a great job in the superbowl they have both intercepted it once but it was amazing when harrison took that ball 100 yards but if it is my opinion steelers are more advanced and better LETS GO STEELERS but cardinals your still good|`|XLXncQu9aa	I like how you added all of those stats.  You do have a legitimate argument, but you cannot forget the fact that paper stats mean nothing if you don't show up.  The fact is it is about momentum and who wants it more.  The Cardinals were never expected to be in this position let alone win a playoff game.  But they have truly shocked the world and they will do so if they win on Sunday.  I think they have a good chance of winning.  You are probably a fan of the Steelers, and there is nothing wrong with supporting your team.  But I won't go so far to say the Steelers can't lose.  I think some respect is deserved of the Cardinals.  They have played hard to get here, despite the critics.  They also have a great WR in Fitzgerald, and so far no team in the playoffs had an answer for him.  So I think the chances of the Cardinals winning is just as great as the Steelers.  Realistically any team can win with the right amount of motivation.  Ever heard the term, "Any given Sunday"?|`|rzkFHAEJaa	No amount of pleading will make it so the Steelers won't lose. It only makes YOU look more desperate.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Superbowl 13? Did we go 30 years back in time?    For your sake, you better hope you're right.|`|KNTofuxMaa	Hate is a very strong word. I hate the Steelers. It's posts such as this that further reinforce that sentiment.    Screw the Squealers.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	Thank you for representing our fan base so well...no wonder us Steeler fans are getting slammed on here. For the record, I never doubted the result of Super Bowl 13 either.........|`|tWUQU4Juaa	Man-o-man , it almost makes me feel sorry for the Cardinals . Really when you think about it they don't stand a chance .    Steelers 35------Cardinals 3|`|ZImavV2Oaa	steelers ftw.|`|5wlLABo2aa	Well! I sure hope your right!! And are there really going to be many more steelers fans thatn Cards fans?
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I think it will be Sting.  Not only does he not participate in the gang beatdowns he usually just walks away from them with a rather annoyed expression on his face.    He started this group but Kurt Angle came in and took over as leader; Sting hardly gets to say anything any more.  Angle does most of the talking for the group.  Booker, Nash, and Steiner follow along with whatever Angle says.    I think Sting is going to get tired of the beatdowns and the way the MEM disrespects everybody, and he's going to turn on them.  "You guys just don't get it," he'll say.  "I didn't want a gang of thugs but that's what you are.  This group was supposed to be about respect but you don't respect anybody.  You're worse than the kids in the locker room".|`|K95QGwsSaa	TED DIBIASE|`|HpbuBRtAaa	My guess is Sting. I've been reading that he's really not involved in the beat downs in case that they want him to turn babyface again.|`|RskPXtibaa	vince mcmahon|`|ZDyiSTwoaa	stable glamarella - person to turn on it beth pheonix|`|ODGOdxuOaa	Sting.

He selfishly believes that ONLY he is worthy to be the Champ.|`|UvMP9yOCaa	Sting|`|H0idNjxmaa	My step sis told me Sting and I said why? hez the one that created it. then she said: That's why hez goin' to be the one that ends it. I agree with that.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	well to leave it could be steiner or nash. both for medical reasons though. to turn on the MEM i agree with everyone and say sting. he seems to speak for himself and just kind of stands around and does nothing when the beat downs happen.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	This will be a classic story line of Sting trying to stop a "gang" beating and then he gets beat up, which sets off a feud that can last to the summer. Done right, it can lead to a major conclusion and Sting is one who would be able to pull this thing off.|`|GKJV2EBSaa	Sting looks like he'll be leaving or will turn on MEM.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I also say Sting|`|KIOR56r6aa	Sting has the biggest possibility|`|7rpILeYtaa	Sting|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Sting.|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	The obvious answer would be Sting but I'm gonna go for Steiner. I think they'll be a time in the future where he doesn't feel respected in the group, has enough of being lackeys for the rest of the Mafia and just leaves|`|8Im1iGFTaa	sting|`|u2H68wiaaa	Sting.  He's the only who doesn't participate in the gang beat downs, and always looks like he doesn't want to be with the group.  Add to that that he'll most likely lose the World Title to Angle at the next PPV, and I think it's only a matter of time before Sting leaves the stable.|`|YhfMrppSaa	Sting, when MEM attacked Brother Ray u see his recation, he walked away, now Sting made me think he is the first man to walk out.    2nd Nash    3rd Stenier      4th Big T      5th Angle seprated.        I'm guessing for 2 thoufgh 4, u know.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	sting|`|VQlrQ34Faa	Sting
9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	Rey Mysterio is the most overrated wrestler. He's not even a real wrestler. All he does is flips. The set up for the 619 is so lame and predictable. There's no way this puny little wrestler can go toe to toe with these 250 pound behemoths. The WWE title became worthless when Rey Mysterio won it.

He is a good athlete too. I remember back in the day, all of his amazing matches against Ultimo Dragon and Psychosis in WCW. The whole 619 ghetto thing is a bit annoying though. Also, I don't think he should have ever taken his mask off. Thank god he wears it these days.|`|qVDY1hm5aa	Rey Mysterio is a big asset to the company. He's one of the top five merchandise sellers in the WWE, a big hit with the younger generation and a decent high-flyer.
u4FGBKi4aa	Sport shoes are just better for support of your legs and back...|`|Wjp0niEhaa	Actually, I think it is a good thing to run bare feet. As long as you aren't running outrageous distances (like 5-10 miles), with bad form (pounding your heels first), you should be fine.  I think feeling the ground with your feet as you run, might actually help your running form.|`|qU70m29uaa	The hard floor is probably not good for your knees, back, and feet.|`|Ue5mbS5Laa	if your doing yoga and streching...then ok!  but to jog and run....no way!|`|AZxJfST5aa	It's much better to wear running shoes because of the support they create for your knees and ankles.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	Sure is. Just make sure you run/walk correctly, and watch how you place your feet...    Your feet are made to walk on without having shoes around them.  But if you're not used to it (like most people in "modern" society) you're feet's muscles will have atrophied and need to (re)gain their strength and size so you'll need to go slow initially.|`|qMKYjAMoaa	Should be.

8bTder08aa	The bridle is the gear the horse wears on his head that holds the bit in his mouth and has reins attached, and is used by the rider to help control the horse.    "Off the bridle" means the horse has backed off forward momentum and is not trying to move forwardly.  A horse that is "off the bridle" has quit trying and is not responding to the rider's cues to move forwardly.  The horse may still be going in the forward direction, but he isn't putting his best effort into it.    A horse that is "on the bridle" is moving forwardly, making his best efforts and putting his energy into trying to go forward.  He is paying attention to the rider and has his heart and mind on going forward.  He is trying.    A horse that "runs through the bridle" is running away, not paying attention to the rider.    When a horse comes off the bridle in the race, he may be doing it because he's spent his best efforts and is done; or he may have just mentally checked out and decided he didn't want to try hard.  The rider has to know which is the case:  if a horse comes off the bridle because he's tried his best and has nothing left to give, you don't want to keep after him.  But a horse that comes off the bridle because he's unwilling to exert himself, or is sulking because things haven't gone his way (he's been trapped behind other horses, or the rider is trying to rate him when he wants to take off, or he resents the rider's urgings to move forwardly) needs to be persevered with, because once he's gotten the idea that he can quit if he wants to, it's hard to get him to try hard enough to win.  This kind of horse is deemed "ungenuine" and is the bane of a trainer's life:  the horse with known talent who will not exert himself to use it.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	Both of the top answers are fairly correct, however the actual bridle, is the leather piece that goes on the horses head, and holds the BIT.. The bit is a piece of metal that goes in the horses mouth, and it was ultimately controls the horse.. There are SEVERAL different types of bits for different horses.. Some horses require a heavy, controlling bit, and some like a light, snaffle-type bit.. When a horse runs, it pulls on the bit. You can regulate the speed of the horse by pulling back on it.. Some horses do not pay alot of attention to it, and thus require a more harsh type bit to get their attention.. Some will respond to the lightest touch.. Every horse is different.. But the expresions most correctly used, are "Off the bit," or  "spit the bit" Both  mean turning the bit loose and not pulling on it..|`|8lsBBK62aa	Think of it as the steering wheel and brakes of a horse and off the bridle means you're starting to run on empty!
rDHsyJZiaa	because foreigners think agressive sports are when you cut off heads of tigers, have stadium sized collesium style life-or-death style fight-offs, and more. Foot ball gets pads too.

Our football evolved from rugby, so there are enough similarities that people keep making comparisons, without understanding that football and rugby have grown into two totally different sports.     Just listen to how many times foreigners say our football players are wimps because they play wrapped up in helmets and pads, while rugby players don't wear any protective gear. It shows that they don't understand how football is a different game from rugby. Football is MUCH more violent. It's a foul in rugby if you don't bring a player safely to the ground when you tackle him, but in football, you can launch your body like a missile into someone if you want to. Rugby is a contact sport; football is a collision sport.    They also complain about all the starts and stops in football ... again, they're used to rugby, where the action is continuous.    It's their loss. Rugby is an awesome game, but so is football.    But then, we don't give soccer much of a chance over here, so I figure we can't throw stones ...
r5AMG8g7aa	Matt,   without being able to watch you it is difficult to advise you. The best advice would be from your instructor. He is there and can see what you are doing.   The only advice I can give is to try not to let the opponent get you backing up. Fighting while constantly having to back up is a good way to lose. Get with your instructor and have him give you tips and watch while you spar.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	You have to establish respect or your opponent will do this to you.  hit him hard a few times early and even if you miss he will think twice before coming so relentless at you.  this means you have to develop the power to hurt though and the speed and endurance.   punches will always get through your guard if that's your only defense.  you have to learn to dodge weave bob roll and parry as counter punch.  for now use your offense as your defense|`|vOOf7xdEaa	dont know sorry|`|BLTq0vLWaa	Firstly seeing as it's your first time It's going take a few fights before you start to adjust to how the whole sparring process works.    You said he's very aggressive and that he comes at usually quite fast? Usually due to this his own guard or defence is poor hence the need to attack in order to defend himself.    Usually aggressive fighters try to end a bout as quickly as possible as they cant pospone that work effort over a long duration and will quickly tire out and often lack edurance, so the longer you can prospone the bout the more tired he will become. Keep your guard high, and move about only when nessceray in avoidance. Keep him at bay with kicks and if he does get close to you, dont get involved move back out as soon as you can.    As i can gather he comes at you fast but lacks alot of power, this is more than likely due to the stance he fights in that prevents him from acually using his bodyweight in his punches which means his stance is incorrect and he will lack alot of balance and you'll find will be supprisingly easy to actually knock over.    As for fighting back, using the same methods as him wont work, and he is likely to win down to experience fighting like that. Your already doing the correct thing by fighting only with counter-moves. Only throw punches at hm when is there is a clear opening, and by the sounds of his fighting style he will leave himself open an awful lot. Aim for points around the side of his knee with your kicks, and the centre of the chest and face with punches.    It's hard to adapt to it at first, but you need to learn how to think, watch how he fights others by the sounds of it he is likely to make the same simple defensive mistakes over and over.    Also seeing as he's aggressive use his own aggression against him, he's likely to lean into his punches, move to one side leaving him to stumble forward (due to lack of balance) and you've got a few open shots.    Don't worry about hitting targeted areas on his body such as the neck, kidneys, etc. just concentrate on what he's doing    As for your gaurd keep it high and very strong, and keep your chin at a angle, will cause is punces to glance off.  And keep your feet shoulder width apart with your shoulder's square, so your left shoulder at he front if your right handed and vice versa, this gives him a much smaller target to aim at.    It's hard to convey this over to you writing, from people who have never seen you fight, so talk to your friends and instructors there about how to adjust and adapt to situations rather than take our word for it, thats the best advice.  It's all part of the learning process you'll learn how to deal with it so keep enjoying it ;)        You've been told some good stuff by the guys ^^^^ above ;)  Good luck ;)|`|MnCqBqz5aa	Lol, if your opponent is mad agressive...     Use your opponents own force or strengh against themselves. You can easily achieve that once you' ve found you cetre origin and balance. Fight like a ghost, then you' ll have total control over them.    It' s like reconizing how gravity works on other people, also, once they loose balance, you may easily COMBO (MANY TIMES AT ONCE) attack them in vital places & organs such as the neck, eyes, face, genitals (LMAO) etc.    Never concentrate strengh to much in one particular area of you body during an attack, cus that would just slow you down. Don' t be tensed, act like each fight is a training practice, den throw quick fists, like short ones that are real fast, so your punches are safe from being grabbed or caught etc. due to the speed.    Good Luck- XD|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	get the book secrets of championship karate has very good info|`|dmX3zwbHaa	When some1 rushes me i try to front kick,back kick him or step aside and at the same time giving i left hook punch.|`|AA11102922	Hi there    I've been doing Taekwondo for about 2 years and found the same problem at first.  Then I started getting friends to put my body armour on them at home for a while or even just attaching it to something heavy like a chair and just throw random kicks at home myself.  It was amazing how quickly my speed increased and how many groups of kicks I could put together when I was relaxed and calm in my own surroundings away from the pressures of the actual class.  My confidence soared and within a few weeks I found that it was an instant automatic reaction when I was sparring and I didnt even have to think about it anymore.  It definitely worked for me.     Good Luck!|`|qIa6m7pnaa	Aggression is your best friend.   That is all your opponent was doing to you.    Also you might want to take a look at your stance.   Are your shoulders square to your opponents?  If they are try blading your stance.   This will give your opponent less of a target to hit.|`|4LYasBGXaa	i can't say anything about your specific technique, your "guard" in this case is not a wall, so i don't know what you were doing- you have to actually move it to prevent from someone connecting. i don't know specifically what happened with you but maybe thats it. was the guy powering through or was he just a "sharpshooter"?    he was probably just quicker on the strike than you if it was your first time-    all the things you mentioned were just part of the learning process-   you will eventually not be nervous and self-consious and become more agressive yourself and initiate attacks ratehr than wait to counter.    quite honestly what you describe sounds like most people thier first time out- hesitant to initiate an attack for fear of eating leather.    the only real advice i can give is also the best advice- keep it up and ask your instructor and opponent (if he is more skilled tahn you and can pick out things) what you need to do to improve.     this is why you spar- to learn from mistakes in training so you don't make them in competition or out on the street.    what you do in pad work will translate- this is why you spar- to learn to apply what you have done in training.  thats also why many many arts might train technique well- but how good is it if you don't learn to apply it- be glad you are at a school and train in a manner that you will eventually learn to apply what you do outside of sparring to actually useing.    focus not so much on "winning" in sparring- but trying to successfully implement what you have learned- the guy is not there to beat the snot out of you- he is, like you, there to better himself at fighting.    EDIT:    there is a difference between bieng aggressive and overly agressive- sounds to me like this "aggression" might be him coming after you which is probably a perception based upon you never sparring before- don't confuse normal attacking with someone bieng overly aggressive.    be carefull here and rely more on your instructors who have seen you fight and can tell you to make specific adjustments rather than people on the internet who have not seen you fight to make specific reccomendations about your performance.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Keep sparring.|`|eAzq2N9raa	NEVER GIVE UP!!|`|479f89e771d6cadd15df056eaf3128b2aa	I think you have two choices.    1. Develop an amazing guard and let your opponent tire them-self out trying to get through it.    2. Get your first shot in before they do.    When I am sparring I have a tendency to be too defensive and wait for an opening before launching a shot. Unfortunately this strategy usually ends up with me being forced backwards and being overwhelmed in the manner you describe. The only way to prevent this is to be more aggressive than your opponent. Get the first shot in, and then keep following up with loads more.    You could ask your instructor to insist that you and your partner do controlled sparring at half speed. This will help you get used to sparring, develop your technique, and develop your ability to see techniques coming at you.    Hope this helps.|`|uepdHurFaa	Everyone will have their own style of fighting even within certain styles.    I teach muay thai and have fought for 11 years. Being first off the mark is definatly an advantage most of the time.    When you are first learning muay thai, practiise and practise and practise some more using your jab plus leg kicks. Dont be afraid to fire off your jab continously, your opponent can still still counter but will have to come under or use angles more.  If he does get through with clever a solid leg kick is always easy to stick in even at awkwrd angles.    A front kick is also useful to put distance between you and catch some time, obvioulsy you can then also latch on a combination after|`|c5menwRwaa	Use controlled aggression, intimidate your opponent, get distance with solid push-kicks. Don't let getting hit phase you, Muay Thai is a rough sport, develop the attitude of wanting to get hit, iand smile whenever you get hit.    Practice moving forward off center 45 degrees to your weak side when your opponent comes in.    Don't close your eyes, don't get over-whelmed.    Determined mind, strong heart.

AA11488609	With their continued run and some luck, yes.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	LOL never going to happen!!! Bobcats getting the 8th spot or not. Plus, the greatest playoff run in NBA history will forever be my Knicks, whom in 1999 became the only team to make it to the Finals. We beat the stacked 1st seed Heat, becoming the 2nd of 3 total teams that were 8th seeds that knocked down a 1st seed. Then we swept a stacked Hawks team in the Semis, and in the ECF w/o Ewing we survived the very stacked Indiana Pacers. Also, in those playoffs there were many memorable moments, like Houston's running running lay in w/ 2 seconds left, Sprewell single handedly beating the Hawks, and LJ's 4 point play.    Tim Duncan was great as always and imposed his will on us. But, that was a close Finals series and we played with heart. Who knows what would have happened if Ewing would have played.    Your Bobcats have nothing on the Knicks now or in 99. Knicks this year beat you guys 3 times already. But, I still hope you make it.    99 Knicks:    PG. CHARLIE WARD  SG. ALLAN HOUSTON  SF.

c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	If you have a child, guns are perfectly safe if you use your brain.      A gun safe is the best idea, but all those trigger locks and integral gun locks actually work.  I think the last two are all worthless when it comes to practicality.      If you want to use a gun for self defense (maybe not your case), you need it fairly handy.  This can be achieved safely with a quick release handgun safe that is bolted down.  Some are keypads, and there are some that are biometric (fingerprints).  They are a bit more expensive, around $300, but they sound snazzy.    I don't see why a range that rents handguns wouldn't let you rent one, but I'd seriously reconsider your attitude on gun ownership.      Gun safety is a conscious decision.  Any perfectly reasonable person can keep their family safe.      .22's are very cheap to shoot, but I prefer something larger.  9mm is nice compromise between power and cost to shoot, though I prefer a .40 S&W.    Have fun, be safe.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	First off where do you live  Does your state require permits  And yes you can rent a handgun for use at the range without a permit because you are under the direct supervision of the range who will have a permit to do so    I can never understand the mentality of people who think that just because they have a child that they should protect they have to discount one of the most effective means of protecting that child    Teach your children  about guns and they wont be fascinated with them  get a relatively cheap handgun safe to keep it in when you can not be in control of it    I gre up around guns as far back as I can remember  Most were left out with ammo within easy reach, that was the norm back then  No one I  grew up with ever felt the need to break into anything and shoot anyone|`|HHICEewjaa	How will you ever protect yourself form an armed intruder without a firearm?  Going to try to defend yourself with a kitchen knife against a gun?    There are lots of ways to keep a child from getting a gun without even using a gun lock.  A gun in a safe or in a gun lock takes too long to get to when you need it anyway.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	You can usually go to most ranges and rent guns to shoot there without a permit.  Of course, you can't take it off the range.    However, if you're going to want a gun for self-protection, don't go with a .22.  Unless you hit them is a critical area, it's not going to do much damage.|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Nah, most licensed ranges that rent guns allow you to shoot with no ID needed but a drivers license.    You just may have to be accompanied by a range safety officer... but Im sure you dont need a License to have a pistol to rent a .22 pistol from the range.

CBVlu3Gvaa	If you read the real Specs for every club made...you will see an allowable variance of + or - 2 degrees.

One of the problems being created by all of the manufacturers is they are giving players too many options when trying to choose equipment.

Now you have to pick one for soft sand, firm sand, wet sand, dry sand, and on and on. Where will it all end. Thankfully they'll have to pry my wedges out of my cold dead hands.|`|aX8nee8gaa	Honestly bounce angles of 8 and 10 degrees are so close together as to be virtually indistinguishable.

xhPKkkELaa	Yes, in some places, but not in south Florida.the Bahamas break up the Atlantic groundswell (see below). However, driving just a little bit north gets you close to some decent surfing spots. If you are a surfer looking for a Spring Break town, stay further north if you are Florida bound. The crowds are worse, but the surfing is more realistic.    "Most spots past the Fort Pierce Inlet (South Hutchison Island to Miami) can only receive groundswell from sources north and northeast of the Bahama Bank, an archipelago 60 miles off of the Florida coast. The Bahamas shield the region from frontal assaults by hurricanes and southeasterly swells, making it less consistent than breaks up the coast, especially during summer months. Except during large east swells and the extremely rare swells coming from 180 degrees south, the beach break at Fort Pierce's North Jetty is the first spot north enough of the Bahama bank to work on easterly groundswell, essentially marking the transition into Central Florida."  Surfline.com    http://www.surfline.com/travel/index.cfm...|`|ypB3QDWNaa	The only decent surf in all of Florida is found ONLY from Miami/Ft. Lauderdale north up to the Jacksonville/St. Augustine area.  There is NO SURF whatsoever in the Keys or anywhere on the west coast.

CQo3Y0Jmaa	I would have to say I love doing the basic ones still as lame as that may sound, it helps me keep my basics up to par and strength. In a competition I would do Gojushi ho sho or Seipai maybe but under BB Id do Hieon Yandan.    I do know the bunkai of each movement as well but I do not know if they are JKA standards.|`|c5menwRwaa	In ZDK we were taught the Goju kata and their bunkai, my favorite at the time was saifa because of the speed and coordination required to perform it.    My favorite now though not a kata by contemporary terms is ninjutsu's sanshin no gata as it holds the principle of movement. You can destroy an opponent with sanshin alone.|`|4LYasBGXaa	gun-kata,    becasue equalibrium is a bad *** movie.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Katas?  Yawn.|`|7e730f6436a4fbf1ea59232ed326b671aa	Zagyo Shihogiri (4 direction cut from the seated position) because it is the kata that took me the longest to master. Once completed fully it is impressive, powerful and beautiful to observe. It is also long and gives one time to truly lose oneself in it. I have still not reached the point of mushin at the start (I still have to say to myself "ok.....first...."  while seated, but then it just flows. To this day, I can't clear that first thought of beginning without continuing to sit there and not start. How do you start without thinking 'start'?  LOL Maybe I need to be more realistic. Wakaru-wake nai-yo.    Peace on your Path.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	kata with out bunkai in my opinion is useless.  so yes, i know the bunkai for all the kata i teach. i have not had time to research every kata i have learned and dont know them in great detail, but  most shotokan kata i have. and a lot of the kobudo and iaido kata i have as well.  some of the bunkai i was taught others i learned on my own or researched it.    as for favorite kata i have a few of them on the top of the list is unsu  then there's nijushiho, tekki/naihanchin, seipai and gankaku, and a few others    although i'm learning rohai now so that is going to knock gankaku down a space.    if you include kobudo and iaido thats another list.|`|QM2A6rBlaa	I can honestly say I don't have one. Each one has strengths and weaknesses. I tend mor eto have favorite motions out of the kata, rather then the kata itself.    Yes my school is heavy on realistic understanding of the motion, as well as training it with aliveness.|`|nRBC4E5saa	Probably Naihanchi Shodan, overall.  The bunkai I've seen for it that make the most sense to me make it a close-ranged system, and I'm a close-ranged fighter.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	In my style I teach 12 kata. Back in the mid 1970's I knew 32 kata, at the time I reached Shodan(not all of them were from the same style). However, I did not understand the bunkai of any of them. Now I spend my time dissecting the kata I teach and studying with other martial artists. My goal is to learn as much of the bunkai as possible for each kata. That in itself is a lifetime goal since there are multiple bunkai for each technique in any kata. As for my favorite kata..... I like several. Naihanchi Shodan, Bassai, Ku-San-Ku, and Sei-San, are my favorites. Why? because I like the bunkai and the way they flow, and that fact that they are unusual.  I'm looking forward to researching Ni-Sei-Shi, as time permits.    I fully agree with Shihan J that kata without bunkai is not of much use.      Funakoshi Sensei once said that if you knew all the bunkai from just one kata, you would be a deadly fighter.    Anyone that doubts that has not been to a Seminar by Seiyu Oyata. He makes Dillman look like a kindergartner.    **************************************...  EDIT: I see here that we are not all talking bout the same thing when we talk about bunkai. It is clear to me that what some here view as bunkai is not what other know it to be. Bunkai to many people is a very simple way to use the techniques. It is usually based on what the techniques look like it is.  To advanced martial artists is not what bunkai is. Kata was designed to hide the real use of the techniques. If you think that a techniques such as the so called X-block is in fact a block for a low kick, then you fall into that category. The so called X-block is not a block at all. It is a grappling technique for one. It can be many other things as well. True bunkai is not something that the average martial artist will be able to figure out for themselves. It requires that someone that has this knowledge first teach you some of the keys to unlocking the original intent.   This is not meant to put anyone down, but to distinguish the difference between those beginning to learn bunkai, and the more advanced applications.|`|HuwEDF0Qaa	My current favorite is Sip'jin, but that is because that is the one I am learning.  No, I haven't figured out the bunkai of this form completely, yet.    My students like to watch me do Basai, and yes, I know the bunkai of that form.  We may or may not have been taught each move's application, but we're encouraged to figure out what each move may be doing.  Sometimes, one student will come up with something completely off the wall, and when we try it out in live application, it works better than the "logical" technique.

RogGmYUCaa	practice dibbling with your left hand, to get to the basket, you will need that, when you are driving in fake like you are going to the right, and then go left; and you will have beaten your opponent. Good luck!|`|jDi45m0uaa	Practice triple threat, so before you dribble you can fake your opponent that your going left but your going right.    Also bump into him a little so he can move back.|`|eXYY6qDtaa	practice left-handed lay-up's in your practice's  to get to the basket, seel out your opponent, place your foot  between his two feet, twist, and go to the hoop.
DymLS3Nyaa	Always been at night....|`|GwawzO5Faa	That really depends on what time zone it's being played in and what time zone you live in. It's not dark at 6:35 on the west coast. It's only 3:35 there.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Kickoff is in daylight on east coast but does end up concluding under the stars. If a west coast stadium is host to SB the game is played in daylight. SB has always been played around this time from what I can recall.|`|JTSNljLhaa	idk i thought it always been night, well atleast we get to watch it at night while the people on the West have to watch it in the afternoon|`|WlzvmavXaa	it has always been at night that I know of
KNTofuxMaa	How will the fare? They will certainly have trouble with Warner and his outstanding receivers corp. If they blitz, Warner has a very quick release and the experience to burn them. If they don't blitz then, Warner can sit back and pick them apart. It's all going to come down to execution.     Offensively, the Steelers can only hope that Ben doesn't lose the game for them.  Their offense has been less than impressive and they can only hope that the defense plays well. Pittsburgh cannot win a shootout. They lack the offensive firepower.|`|jwQPWl5Haa	The Steelers will win the game if they get their running game going to set up the play action passing and protect Big Ben on passing plays. Fast Willie and Mweldwe Moore are healthy and make a good 1-2 punch of speed and quickness. Gary Russell will be the big back to get those tough yards. Hines Ward will be a big factor even if he doesn't catch a single pass. He will keep 2 defenders around him plus his downfield blocking will spring some big plays. Holmes, Washington and Sweed will be open most of the game.    The Cardinals defense is soft and I suspect that they will wilt in the fourth quarter. If the Steelers have a good halft time lead the game is over. The Steelers have only given up 29 points all year in the 3rd quarter.    The Steelers defense is good enough to keep the Cardinals in check most of the game. There 3-4 defense will be after Warner all day and even if they don't get a lot of sacks they will put pressure on him and cause him to get rid of the ball too quick at times.     I see this game going like this, Steelers take the lead  at halftime 17-7, and put it away in the third quarter and go into the fourth quarter leading 27-7.  Warner makes a few plays in the fourth against a prevent defense and the final score is 37-20.|`|rgA2o9c0aa	Well, the main key to winning for the Pittsburgh Steelers is to score more points then the Arizona Cardinals in the given amount of time that the game takes.    They follow this key they should be in good shape.    Next SuperBowl question please?|`|5wlLABo2aa	It bassicly depends on Arizona's running Defense. Against measly defenses, The steelers' offense looks great.

It's a Belgian-made copy of an English Manton shotgun marketed to play on the names of Joseph and John Manton. It's not the only one.  There were literally dozens of copies of famous maker's guns at that time.  J. Manton & Co. was another copy made in Belgium that was sold by Crescent (HD Folsom) in the US.    That E/LG stamp in the oval/pineapple under your barrel is a Belgian proofmark.  It's the only thing you need to look at.  Look for it, you'll find it.    It's not "no value", but it's far less than a real English Manton.  You're looking at $250-$400 or so tops depending on condition.  Date, 1890 off the top of my head.    If you want to, email me your pics and I'll try to date it for you.

Bgpk4npBaa	ima die hard fan and i believe that the cowboys are in dier need of a new coach and not just any coach i mean some1 like Bill Cowher or Mike Shannahan     im realy scared that their gonna blow it again next year with this bum as.$ coach Jerry Jones need to fire him and back off and let the new coach do his thing...............|`|pDwQgwvRaa	They need a new owner.  I like listening to Troy Aikman not only  as a color commentator but he throws in a few gems once in awhile.  He is quite diplomatic in his answers as he does not rant but provides good insight regarding the game, players and coaches.  He is fair-minded and I like the comment he had about his differences with owner Jerry Jones.  He basically said he and Jones disagree as to the importance of team chemistry and leadership on the field.  Jones' meddling and the flair for controversy is ruining the Cowboys chances of becoming a Superbowl caliber team.  Yes they have the talent but lack a good head coach and leadership on the both sides of the ball.  Personally, I think it all starts with Jones.|`|xLqMubuBaa	I don't know why Jones keeps committing and staying with Phillips.  I really don't get it.Especially knowing Jones' hunger for another championship.I don't think Phillips can get it done.To be honest,I don't think Romo can get it done.At least he hasn't proven it yet.Look at the rings on Aikmans hand.I know ,you didn't ask about the QB.  Heck,Johnson & Parcells were great coaches.Switzer wasn't terrible.He won a superbowl !  I just don't have faith in Philllips.And I don't understand how Jones could possibly have faith in him.  They need a new coach !|`|Ltuj145xaa	yea, wade is a big teddy bear and cant keep his players ego's in check... we have some of the biggest egos in the nfl!  what we need is a parcells like coach, maybe gruden, to come in there and lay down the law...|`|ZImavV2Oaa	jerry jones needs to go, and they need to get rid of problem players. and get a new coach to say the least.......        all jerry jones cares about is fillin seats and makin a buck, not winning. he'd rather collect names like t.o. and people that cause nothing but trouble and arent worth the helmet they put on.|`|CohTdlI9aa	I don't think Dallas Cowboys need a new head coach.|`|jLM4Yo32aa	No, keep that coach so they can be losers next year.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	they need a new owner. but as a texans fan i kind of like seeing them lose. so they shouldnt change a thing.|`|VhNmMWbXaa	New coach, new owner, new roster.

I think they need a new owner. Jerry Jones is the biggest problem the Cowboys have. His Texas sized ego has been our downfall this decade. Wade may need to be replaced but, he has done a decent job.

Most people simply mean "A watch UFC with my friends and i think im a good fighter cause i beat a dudes *** in high school once"
nhINToFyaa	ok if you are a regular skateboarder than you put your kick flip marker your left leg in the left corner by the bolts or screws. Then you try to jump and kick your foot out. Its simply easy. If you are a goofy skateboarder then you put the marker on the right corner by the screws.

It's simple, I broke my last Worth mitt over a freak accident at an ASA tournament last year, during it's warrenty (It is pretty expensive.) And when I called the factory they said "Hello, you have reached Rawlings sporting goods." So I told them about my delema, and they sent me a brand new higher quality Worth mitt. =D  It is the greatest mitt I have ever owned in my life.

koTI0lsMaa	1)Stretch: Stretching will prevent soreness and aches. good stretches include the tree, the pancake, and the tennis player.  2)Find a nice place with a deep water to do it in, so you don't hit your head.  3)Start by jumping in backwards, get comfortable with not seeing where you are landing. Do this with your legs medium bent.    4)See how far you can jump in. (forward) If it is not very far, remember backwards, you will jump about half that distance, so make sure it has a good distance.  5)Now to get a good back-flip, you must practice. So try standing with your back to the pool, and jumping, and landing on your back.     6)Get in the water. Do an underwater back-flip. See how you control your back and spine with it.       7)So, to complete the back-flip, Combine steps 5 and 6.     Tips:To prevent hitting your head try and keep it tucked into your collar bone.  Your arms should be extended to keep balance and stamina    Keep practicing!|`|jaAolejUaa	just back flip and make sure that the pool is more than 6 ft deep|`|pOrwteQUaa	This post has been moved or deleted.|`|XZlFLecLaa	very carefully|`|cf8ab77939ead7223bbb655f627c7404aa	Basically, your screwed for life if you jump like a white boy, but mainly just get up the guts to do it, and pull your legs over and let the momentum carry you.    Its no, "mental preparation" you just do it. But if you cant jump or are a fatty, it wont work.

qtN0ut0daa	I need to know your starting level of fitness. How fast are you currently running a mile? How long before you need to take the test?    You should be running 5 times a week. Try shortening your distance and increasing your speed each week. You want to be just under your maximum heart rate. Calculate this by 226- your age. So for you the maximum heart rate is 213 beats per minute. I reccommend you aim for a target rate of 195 beats per minute.     Make sure you get PLENTY of rest the night before the test. NO cafeen. Eating bananas (potassium) will prevent any cramping. Stay focussed on your breathing. Any real runner knows that proper breathing is the diffference between unleaded and leaded gas in an unleaded tank. NO shallow breaths, but rather longer, drawn out breaths. The longer you can breath during your run through your nose, the better. Only start breathing through your mouth when you reach the point that you need to.    **Given you are asthmatic, have you tryed breathing over a humidifier? The moisture will help open your airway. If you don't own one; no problem. Add some steaming warm water to a large bowl. Lean over the bowl, with a towel obver your head, and breath in the moist air. Doing this the moring of your test will help open up that airway. Please be aware of how you are feelling during any run. If you are on Ventalin, take it with you. No test is more important then your health.    Hope this helps, and please post your details regarding your current level of fitness.|`|yreFf59uaa	by running fast|`|vqm10k3Jaa	Just giving a bit of info, others have given you a lot of tips.  Do you have any way of keeping track on your speed?  to beat a mile in 6:50 would require you (assuming you keep same pace through out the run)  you would have to maintain a speed of at least 10 miles an hour or more.    That breathing tip was really good.|`|mQwyWWHtaa	You might not be able to beat that time due to your asthma but you should definitely try. Never give up because that will only make you less strong.

But in terms of who did more for wrestling, The Undertaker is right up there with the Hogan's, Flair's, and Rhodes. He was essentially the first 'dark' gimmick to go over so huge. In terms of wrestling talent; Muta is obviously better. But overall, I think you have to go with The Undertaker, because wrestling isn't entirely based on wrestling skill alone.

cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Hey it is a nice mock draft can tell you took time in doing it. My critique is that you have Stafford dropping to 10? Nobody has him falling that far, but again the Combine might change a lot of things. Jason Smith at  26 some have him being the top tackle taken, also Everette Brown at  31 ain't going to happen he is certain to go in the top 15. Clint Sintim to the Giants at  29 I agree with if he is avaliable the Giants will snatch him up.|`|y4lCDAZOaa	I like how you think you Cards are gonna have the 32 pick!

I believe if the Lions go for an offensive linemen, they will probably take either Andre Smith or Eugene Monroe. Don't get me wrong, Oher has a ton of potential, but I think Smith is more developed as is Monroe. I also believe that Stafford will be picked before Sanchez. I am also not positive the Chiefs will draft a QB. I have heard that they are satisfied with the play of Tyler Thigpen. I like Aaron Curry in that spot. I also think that you have Beanie Wells being drafted a little too high. He is injury prone and does not have top notch speed. I see him more in the mid to late 1st round. I am also not so sold on the 49ers investing another 1st round pick in a QB. Mike Singletary is big on defense and I could see him going after a guy like Everette Brown. The last thing. Jason Smith will go higher than you have him unless he doesn't perform well in the Combine workouts. Other than that, it looks great.|`|acaAycEXaa	Jason Smith  Jeremy Maclin  Matt Stafford  will all go much higher.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	HORRIBLE!    No way in hell Sanchez gets drafted ahead of Stafford...    And my Jets wont get a Linebacker, we need a Defensive Back (William Moore or Vontae Davis).    And how come there are ZERO safeties in the 1st round?  William Moore is a top 20 draft pick.    edit: Yes actually I could make a better one.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	No way Sanchez is 3rd pick in the draft; are you high???

oMjVp4zGaa	Poles don't have the luxury of the use of reels, poles have a string tied on the end, like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer used. Only rods can be used with reels!    I did go to the page but found it lacking in description as to whether it is a spinning or a casting rod. By the very gradual guides size showing, it appears to be a casting rod. But, without seeing the first guides (closest to the reel seat)diameter I can't say.....|`|cLm5FqWnaa	http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templa...      I have one and never had a problem with it.

vQtW48riaa	I support England.<br>  <br>  1. The ECB's greed.<br>  - Here in England there are 3 Test matches in London per year, whilst there are only 1 or 2 test matches in the North of England. The ECB keep giving 3 test matches to London each year because of money. There are plenty of people in the North of England who want to see Test Match cricket.<br>  <br>  2. The lack of quality spinners in England's recent history<br>  - We have never had a spinner who has even came close to having the talent of a Shane Warne or Muttiah Muralitharan over the last 25 years. England have never had the coaching available to convert a decent spinner into the next Shane Warne, if England had a quality spinner now, we would be up there with the best teams.<br>  <br>  3. Persistance with average players<br>  - Geraint Jones, Sajid Mahmood, Tim Ambrose are just some of the players over the last 3 years who have managed to have a prolonged runs in the England side, despite not having a proven record in England First Class cricket.<br>  <br>  More general things<br>  1. England's ODI record.<br>  2. England's lack of killer instinct<br>  3. Young players focusing on money rather than cricket|`|YcvKwRqiaa	Mine are all with the selectors.<br>  1.

LH7u3wO6aa	I think I can help! I'm working on double axel so I have a few tips...  ~Make sure your jumping up! If you hardly get off the ice your body won't have enough time to get into the right position and cross you legs before you wind up on the ice again.  ~Use your arms. If you pull them up and in it'll help your momentum.  ~Make sure you are pre-rotating on the ice. I'm not sure how to explain this on without being on the ice, so ask your coach about it.    That's all I can think of right now. I wish I could help more!    P.S.- How long have you been working on it? You have to have patience with this jump, it's the hardest one! It typically takes about a year to land it.|`|uiIVD8ssaa	My axel used to look like a two footed waltz flop thingy too, here are some tips, especially for axel:  -make sure your leg goes through, not around when you take off.   -use your arms! have them take the right motion, don't forget to hold your position!  -jump higher. you'll fall less often, because you'll have a chance to land on your feet.  -practice practice practice off ice! Jump around in the back scratch spin position as if you're doing a back spin on land.   -practice waltz jump loop combinations until you are super-comfortable in them.  -jump off ice, and try making two rotations, most people can do one naturally but you have to work at two. When you get that try two and a half, etc. getting two rotations cleanly off ice (720 degrees) can take a while.   Above all, listen to everything your coach says! Good luck!|`|yPRhc6oWaa	YOUR SICK DUDE I AGREE WITH THE GIRL ABOVE ME BAN THAT DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh sorry i have no advice!!:)|`|EaGk5P9Vaa	Easy, use the blade to help cross legs over.

jHqV6yUxaa	Too soon. This year promises a lot, and I mean A LOT.     But between these two fights I pick Berto vs Collazo. It was a more competitive fight with back and forth action.|`|8xyFCsMRaa	i believe 2008 was a great year for boxing but 2009 would see its re-emergence.  there are lots of exciting fighters in each division (except the heavyweight) and upcoming prospect who are expected to make a niche this year.    however, its only january, although the abovementioned bouts were truly a beauty,  there are a lot of marquee fights that are scheduled and soon to be scheduled.  its gonna be an exciting year.|`|CDeZOLmgaa	Because of the upset, and the non stop action, even though It was one sided it was pretty exciting seeing the old veteran destroy the invincible young Mexican, and watching Margo's head snap all over the place and wondering how much he could take was pretty exciting.    I would defiantly go for Mosley-Margarito as fight of the year so far, but remember we still got Pacquiao-Hatton too look forward too|`|zI6cZoAWaa	both of these were good. it is hard to choose. 2009 will be a great year for boxing there are so many good fights coming up|`|Ef4HdzEfaa	Well so far not much a contest right now if we are only looking at the 2 meaningful fights that happened so far this year its gotta be hands down Shane Mosley vs Antonio Margarito. The berto fight was a very good fight as well but cmon now the mosley fight had knockdowns and a k.o. in it , no way the berto fight tops the mosley fight.

More commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault rifle. A weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood. It doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It'll shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export.

The M-4 is pretty but like  an ugly .50 crew served weapon it is wasted if issued to me.|`|vcVZ0IBKaa	The M-4 Carbine.

mjJTQgjJaa	like mark said practice makes perfect ....practice for at least 1 hour every day...just dribble the ball try 2 control it....pass it from foot 2 foot.....run a mile a day....for kicking get a big area and try 2 kick the ball with different areas of ur foot.....for long distance try 2 kick the ball from under 2 were u almost kick the ground.......hope this helps|`|7koWGjhNaa	Ball control is key. Just launch the ball at a wall and try to control it quickly when it bounces back.|`|DrbO2hl4aa	just always say that u are the player u like..... like guaredado<br>  just say im guardado and im daring<br>  <br>  if u say ur favorite players name while u play u will fell ur really good|`|PFQxbEqmaa	perfect practice makes perfect|`|VMmHYWjxaa	Play more sweetie =) More practice, the better you get!
b8UzJEiBaa	According to USA Swimming, an invitational meet is a "type of meet that requires a club to request an invitation to attend the meet." They may be restricted by time standards, such as an A/B meet, A meet, etc.     JO (I'm assuming you mean Junior Olympic meets) are an "an age group championship meet conducted by the LSC." LSC is  your "Local Swim Committee. The local level administrative division of the corporation (USA-S) with supervisory responsibilities within certain geographic boundaries designated by the Corporation." By "actual JO meet," I'm assuming you mean a national or worldwide version-- I don't think there is one. However, Nationals, which you make by reaching really fast time standards, is probably similar to what you mean.    Time standards for A/B are here:   http://www.usaswimming.org/USASWeb/_Rain...  Other time standards are listed on this page:   http://www.usaswimming.org/USASWeb/Deskt...|`|9LVpjgoVaa	Invite swim meets are meets that your teams are invited to and it gives you the privilege of going if you are apart of a team.    First Its Junior Olympics, If you do very well there (top 6 I think) you qualify to go to All Stars. Then the next meet is called Junior Nationals which very qualify for.    below is the exact link to find 2009-2012 National Age Group Motivational Times for both long course and short course in the 'AA' and 'AAA' form.    http://www.usaswimming.org/usasweb/_Rain...    copy and paste into browser.

JBqqS8IXaa	The right build would depend on the position.  If you were going to be a cornerback, you would need to be around 5'10" or 5'11", 180 lbs. and blazing fast.  You can get by if you are a few inches shorter, but you would need great speed.  Darrell Green played corner for the Washington Redskins at 5'8" and 175 lbs., but he was the fastest man in the NFL for many years.  If you are going to be a lineman, you would have to be light on your feet, but big and strong.  We're talking around 6'4" and 300 lbs. for an offensive lineman.  It just depends on the position, but strength, agility, quickness, intuitiveness and intelligence all come into play if you don't have the prototypical size.<br>  Hey!

9lHmcL1jaa	try to do a lot of long distance running every 2nd day.  tennis requires a lot of stamina and this should help and you can also try to run a short distance as fast as you can, such as running 25 metres as fast as you can 4-5 times.  this would be helping with your acceleration speed which is also required for tennis.<br>  <br>  either than your fitness you'd obviously need to play tennis.  i would suggest starting with the basic swings again, forehand, backhand and serving.  don't start hitting the ball straight away, start with just the motions. after maybe 4-5 minutes of practicing the motions you can then start hitting the ball against the wall.  hit the ball left and right and left and right and so on, just lightly, to build up your accuracy again and get the feel of your racket hitting the ball.  after this you can just start to play with your mates.  and always remember to stretch first.<br>  <br>  its nice to hear that you always go to the gym every other day regardless of tennis, this means it will be easier for you to get back into it, as you should be quite fit already.|`|BRTa5h7iaa	The most important muscles for a tennis player would have to be<br>  1. Quads<br>  2. Other parts of your legs<br>  3. Shoulders<br>  4. Forearm<br>  5. Abs<br>  Since our power comes from rotation and explosive power from our low body, legs are more important so don't spend that much time on your arms. I would suggest long distance jogging, some short sprints, footwork exercises (look them up on google, theres lots), ab workouts, and pushups (b/c you do need some upper body strength)<br>  |`|7941db8aae4ffaebc845d12c6575ca9eaa	Run, run, and run some more. Go to the gym by all means, but you have to have stamina, and be long winded....which means RUNNNNN forrest run. |`|5KmtCYgFaa	I suggest you to try running, all tennis players need strong muscles in their legs so they can run. That's the most important thing you need to do, and everything else is optional. Try hitting some balls with some of your friends or maybe a private coach to refresh your memory and get better. Try and maybe fit playing tennis every week into your schedule.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, just run :)|`|B07sKfdvaa	Find a friend and play play play play play!|`|c91a5c595831cbeaa9ee55f15973bedcaa	Running, exercise, sex, you name it.|`|QxrxKmVfaa	Try yoga and jogging. Together, they are miracle workers!|`|5NblOqicaa	Tennis stamina is very different from most other sports. Long distance running has it's benefits but may not be the most efficient work out for tennis fitness. Tennis involves short bursts & changing of direction. Shuttle run in my opinion emulated this best. There are typically many injuries in the shoulder areas so weight/ resistance training for the shoulder, lats would be useful.|`|n4dnIrBlaa	If you want to bulk up I would say eat salads, fruits and vegetables as well as meat. You need all of the nutrients that they give to you. Take multi-vitamins for their nutrients, and exercise. Work on sprints, long distance running, push ups, sit ups and leg lifts and jumping rope. You might want to swim as well, it uses many of the same muscles as tennis.|`|7069f870bd28d69f470bd669963204e1aa	play other sports.  don't burn out by playing tennis exclusively.  Basketball and soccer are great for movement, footwork and endurance.  gym is good for conditioning, play other sports will keep your tennis fresh and fun.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	go for jogs to build endurance<br>  do ab workouts and balance workouts for core strength<br>  lift weights for more muscle strength<br>  <br>  sprint for short distances very fast so u can chase down drop shots or get across the court very quick.<br>  <br>  eat a really good diet and alot of protein|`|AA10208080	Running.

nYC4JHfjaa	I think A should win. Brett Favre will tear up oakland worse then NO did. Portis has been doing great and so has Forte. Both should be fine even against strong defensive teams. Greg Jennings and Braylon should get a good amount of points too. Especially if Braylon plays like he did on monday. Colston can go either way. If he is 100% then he should be fine. Cooley is fine and Nick Folk should be good too. Titans D is the best in the league and they are playing KC. should be a slaughter.|`|MxHRjPFHaa	team b..........<br>    matt had a hell of week last week he's coming around..peterson he's a stud but going against a hell of a run def.....thomas jones had 3 td's last week he'll get you 60-80 yards every game....berrian he's a good pick.........coles not bad..........steve smith he could have a break out game anytime......cooley the redskins will the throwing the ball alot this week to keep up with anderson.........folk back QB's in for romo lot of FG's...........vikings def........they are in the middle of the pack|`|AA11900003	team a i know because im in the upper 2% as far as trivia goes or sports knownledge |`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	a|`|a0223cb90091117bae34fe4ba8dec364aa	Team B wins by 15 points and Forte is playing the Vikings not the Bengals.
52DdSgpxaa	Very solid, i have edwards, portis and bush on a team of mine as well.  It's good that Manning is finally playing like...well, Manning.  Easily going to reach 150+ points.<br>  <br>  You are in 6 team league though, but nice waiting on Edwards, i'm sure there are tons of WR that did better than Edwards until the last 2 weeks or so. |`|lV0IKNoFaa	I would start Berrian over Braylon Edwards.  <br>  <br>  Both Bernard and Bobby Wade, but especially Bernard will be really focused to show Da Bears how to catch Da Ball.<br>  <br>  Braylon could be great,  Washington secondary is healthy now though.  One good cover man to cover the only wideout.  Smoot or Shawn Springs.  Maybe both at times.  Plus CLE is coming off an emotional high and Washington will not want to lose to two puppies in a row at home.  They were complacent last week, but not again.<br>  <br>  The weather should be good in both places for you.|`|Ng5QmZv3aa	QB=MARC BULGER<br>  WR=LEE EVANS<br>  WR=TJ HOUZMANZAHDA<br>  RB=BRANDON JACOBS<br>  RB=EARNAST GRAHM<br>  RB=RONNIE BROWN<br>  TE=TONY GONZALEZ<br>  K=STEPHEN GOSKOWSKI<br>  DEF=TENNESEE|`|f4d79d78cbd0a714a8cfa6f5a073485aaa	Go with Big Ben as QB, he'll have a good day against the Cincinnati Bungles this week; Go with the Steeler's Defense too, it may be a shutout.|`|DH0mGxmyaa	That's a pretty stacked team.  I don't know what other Free Agents you could get.  LT has not looked as strong as everyone expected.  I also have crosby and portis and have no complaints.|`|3crBmyHmaa	Wow, my Nfl fantasy team also has Peyton Manning, Reggie Bush, Bernard Berrrian, and Mason Crosby.|`|m6YHA9Ezaa	If I were you I would be cautious about Braylon Edwards and maybe Reggie Bush. Braylon won't have another great game, and Reggie is playing with Deuce and is playing against Carolina. Everything else looks nice,
