20070706234329AAnqL78	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help! grammar check please?	I received a handful of criticisms from my parents for not helping out and being slothful in front of their eyes before I realize that it is also my responsibility as the eldest son to be a servant-leader toward my siblings and hoping that it would be beneficial in the future. Immediately I did every single thing that is expected from an eldest son: doing laundries, washing the dishes, helping my sibling in their home works, cooking when my parents are not available, and being a good example for my siblings—Servant-leadership at its finest.     Looking back at that time, I really felt that the concept of taking care and looking back at younger siblings is not that beneficial because it is basically the parent’s duty towards their kids—I was dead wrong. My bond with my 3 brothers and sister has increased and become inseparable. I’ve come to know them better, and most importantly earned their respect.

I just recently left the workforce to take care of my kids and think about whether I want to go back to school or not.  I currently have a bachelor's in Business, but I like law, and was wondering if it was worth it to either go to law school, or just get a paralegal degree.  I used to be in banking, but considering the current crisis, I was thinking it would be better to think ahead at what careers are on the rise for the future if I ever decide to go back, which I haven't totally ruled out.

20090225082715AAvpVB6	Education & Reference;Teaching	I have the desire to teach...always have. Where to begin, public schools or university?	I've always had a great desire to teach. Even more so now since I have kids. I love setting foot into my children's classroom and I love the whole education environment. This is why I'm in school for my MBA so I can teach finance and maybe math later on.       So I don't bore anyone further than needed...if you were in my position, would you work for a public school like teach business in middle/high schools or would you work for a college/university? Why do you like one over the other?      I had just finished my certification as a substitute teacher and right before I had planned to put in my application so I can start accepting sub positions we started passing around bronchitis/pneumonia so now since we're done with that, I am putting in my substitute application in this week. I want your honest opinion.      I've also thought about just focusing on the degree, getting it done quicker so I can teach in a university since I was offered the position when I graduated. My 3 year old has a learning disability and I have to be careful what I do job wise till I get something permanent and state benefits so she doesn't loose Medicaid/SSI.

I'm writting a critique essay on an essay about global warming, and my instructor grades very, very, very, very, very, heavily. I need all the help I can get to make sure there are absolutly zero mistakes in my paper. This is just my introduction paragraph, I need to know if it makes sense, have any comma-splices (misplaced commas), mispelled or wrong-words, grammar errors and so forth...               Just how serious is global warming? Should anything be done about it and most importantly can anything be done about it? Global warming is described as earth’s average increase in temperature due to greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide trapping heat and energy in our atmosphere, this is also known as the greenhouse effect. An increase in temperature could result in a change in climate and precipitation patterns. An increase in temperature could also result in ice caps melting bringing great concern to a rise in sea levels, which may threaten our civilization. It has been discussed that our planet is getting warmer, but carbon dioxide has always existed through volcanic emission, is man truly contributing to global warming or is global warming an inevitable phenomenon? Climatologist and social activist, Mark Lynas gives incite on how serious global warning is and answers whether it is too late or not to do something about it. Mark Lynas has written many articles for publications, including the Observer and the Guardian and is the author of the book High Tide: News from a Warming World written in 2004. In Lynas’ essay, “Global Warming: Is It Already Too Late?” he raises social awareness on the situation.

20090227122606AARpI3t	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Anyone else think that American high schools should require uniforms?	Do you think that they should? I'm asking this question as a teenage high school girl.    People usually argue that uniforms take away ones creativity and ability to express themselves, but people pretty much all dress the same anyways (at least where I live), so you might as well dress nicer and look the same.      Besides, it's easier to concentrate when you wear a school uniform. Some of the countires with the best education systems all make uniforms mandatory and you don't endlessly spend time thinking about what you're going to wear. Uniforms are practical, and can look good. In the long run, they would also save money too- you wouldn't spend as much money on clothes.      So, do you think that American high schools should start making uniforms mandatory?

20090227123016AAg7oFA	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How much of a factor does class rank play in college admissions?	I am a junior and we found out our class rank recently.

Anyways I really want to go to a good school; like Cornell or Dartmouth, and although I am in the top ten percent I'm worried that they will reject me because of my stance. I'm really upset about this whole thing, as everyone at school was asking me over and over again if I was valedictorian. I just didn't feel like telling anyone my rank.

20070905202150AAXtT7f	Education & Reference;Homework Help	"Sinner in the Hands of an Angry God." (Get 10 points for doing it right)?	"Consider the fearful danger you are in; it is a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you, as against many of the damned in Hell. You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder; and you have no interest in any mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you.... The sovereign pleasure of God, for the present, stays his rough wind; otherwise it would come like a whirlwind, and you would be like the chaff of the summer threshing floor."       Explain the mood of this passage.       Using specific examples, give one example of a metaphor, one example of a simile, and one example of an allusion that Edwards uses in this passage from the sermon to elicit this particular mood.      Metaphor: A metaphor is a comparison of two unlike things without the use of like or as. For example: In the sermon the metaphor of loathsome insects describes sinners. The congregation's righteousness is compared to a spider's web. God is compared to an archer. What metaphor is used for Hell in the italicized passage?       Simile: A simile is a comparison of two unlike things using like or as. For example: "The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present." What similes are used in the italicized passage?       Allusion: An allusion is a reference to someone or something that is known from history, literature, religion, politics, sports, science, or some other branch of culture. Puritan writing makes allusions or references to specific passages from the Bible. As you read the sermon, locate the allusions to biblical verses and figures.       What specific words (minimum of three) does he choose to make his tone clear?       What images (pictures in the listeners' mind) does Edwards use in the passage to make his tone clear? What effect do those images have on establishing the tone of the piece?       In the last two paragraphs of the sermon (refer to the Investigate page of this lesson) Edwards talks about an "extraordinary opportunity" his congregation has. What is this opportunity? How does his sermon persuade the congregation to take advantage of this opportunity?

I'm working hard this semester to raise my GPA before I am going to apply in November. I am also planning to join the Honors Program (TAP) and join the honor society Alpha Gamma Sigma. I was also a member of the Student Goverment. Currently I tutor English 6 hrs/week on the side (I am an English major)   If I successfully complete the Honors program and raise my GPA to at least a 3.5 will they look past the F?
