41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I try to put the lids on them so I don't lose them.  But, its inevitable that they will be lost.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Sorry the sock monster and the lid monster are related. I never did master that. I didn spend on tupperware, I started using the tubs the maragrine comes in, I started buying things in plastic realising they were giving me free containers, so if it cost more to get a freebie, I would pay a lttle more. I dont have kids at home, so Im not making lunches, and not having tons of leftovers from meals so its easier for me these days. I use alot of baggies now. I buy at walmart, I have snack, sandwhich quart and gallon. I have those new two pocket ones too. I have correll, and there are only two lids that fit bowls, so If I need a bowl with lid, I have those two. I wish correlle had more lids, I found mine at the seconds correlle shop in my area. <br>  Free containers, and baggies have become my saviour, I love those giant giant new household sized for closet storage too! As far as the few lids I now have, I have a dedicated drawer. But I only have 4 lids now. I have one thing for ice, it lives in my freezer. I have one in the fridge for cheese and lunchmeat, it too never leaves the fridge except for when I clean it, and even if its empty I put it back in the fridge.|`|lXE75yQjaa	I keep the bowl/lid together. I've tried the drawer method before, and that was a nightmare. There are too many lids that are too close in size/shape, and I'd spend a half an hour searching and trying to fit the right one.<br>  <br>  <~~ still gives up from time to time and uses foil or saran wrap...lol|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i have a basket.  i put all the containers and the lids together in the basket.  then once every few moths i go through and make sure they all have matches - no matches = trash|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I actually have this "basket" that I screwed into the side of the cabinet (hard to explain, but basically it is a metal, wire basket.)  All of the lids go in there, sitting sideways, so I can see exactly which lid I need.  Right underneath the basket, I stack like-sized containers.<br>  <br>  This is all after I got rid of a lot of tupperware.  After a while you start accumulating all these weird sizes and shapes and it seems like nothing matches. (The orphaned sock syndrome.)  I bought three sets of one brand with colored lids for each size...and no other tupperware is allowed in the kitchen!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Haha, just the other day I heard my dad mumbling to himself when he was in the kitchen, and my step mom went over and he said<br>  "Cant we just throw all these damn tupperware containers away?? Im throwing them away! There are no lids to any of them, this is ridiculous, it;s insane."<br>  <br>  HAHA lol my step mom did not let him throw them away though. ;)<br>  Maybe she knows where the lids are.|`|AA10943329	just keep them away from a two year old. That often works. And become a horder and never throw anything away. It always turns up eventually|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Well, I used to keep all the bowls and lids together in one "Tupperware Drawer" in the kitchen.<br>  <br>  But Johnny didn't like that idea.<br>  <br>  So, now the bowls are in with the pots and pans and the lids are in with his cups.  I tried to move them back where they were 'supposed' to be, but they mysteriously moved back to the other drawers.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I put the lids on, with a piece of paper towel inside to absorb any odours. I just do this for 'real' tupperware, though. The nonames can fight for lids on their own!<br>  I do have some which are rectangular and stackable, so each lid fits under each size of container. So that's handy and neat to store.

Nux5S6oVaa	I just had this problem- LOL!<br>  <br>  I was told by my doctor to take fiber or colace.  The pharmacist reccommended colace. (It brings water to the bowel to relieve constipation).  So that's what I'm using, and I've taken Benadryl and tylenol...all of which my doctor said were ok.<br>  <br>  Basically a nonstimulant laxative is ok.  Though they recommend some more than others. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ddP3klT3aa	This is not a question to ask here. You need to call your OB/GYN.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	I would check with your doctor before taking anything while pregnant.

iFAlZfVMaa	sex, sex, sex... semen  has components that soften the cervix and orgasms will help bring on uterine contractions...<br>  <br>   ALWAYS remember... the way you get a baby out is the same way you go it in!!  You can always hang on til your contractions start naturally...  99% of the time, you body know when your baby is ready...<br>  <br>  *****NEVER ingest ANYTHING (castor oil, black or red cohosh, etc... NOTHING!!!) without the up or down from your dr or midwife... their expertise and wealth of information as well as knowledge of YOUR PARTICULAR medical history is necessary when deciding how and when to artificially bring on labor...*****|`|OtfSP7kHaa	Sex, walking, spicy foods.<br>  Go with sex first.  It worked all three times my wife was pregnant.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Haha! I know how you feel. When I was at 37 weeks I was ready to be done. You could have A LOT of sex. Which probably at this point is no fun but there are things in the mans semen that can induce labor. Nipple stimulation, go for walks, walk up and down stairs, (I skipped) they say primrose oil but that hasn't been proven safe yet. Or call your doctor and ask to get a cervical exam and if you are 100% effaced and starting to dilate you could asked to be induced. In which case they will put you on Pitocen.  The long walk and skipping was the one that did it for me.|`|UKmZcA30aa	When i was 38 weeks and some days i drank some castro oil and i had my membrains stripped. i went into labor the next day and had the baby. Most doctors wont strip your membrains until your 39 weeks, they did mine early because the daddy was leaving in the army. Good Luck!|`|G32X9fnZaa	Lots of sex which can turn into a huge laugh too depending how big your bump is!!!!<br>  Have a walk,nice hot bath and more sex.|`|CrYc4TTSaa	Without the natural hormones to open your body and encourage birth- aint nothing going to happen

His chances of getting that are extremely small. 13-28 hours is the time it would take for him to get sick, but I really don't think that's going to happen. Experts would just rather that those 110 cases don't happen either!|`|vJEatJFPaa	I would be pissed too.<br>  <br>  All you can do is keep observing your baby and make sure hes okay. Chances are he will be fine...Make sure you make it clear to your parents not to do this again.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I would FREAK out too!  If you are so concerned, just call your baby's MD and ask to speak to a nurse (insist if you have too).  Just tell the nurse what happened and give an approximate amount of honey ingested(a cup full, a tsp full, a tbsp full) and how long ago.  She will consult with the MD and let you know what to do.  I have a feeling though that if it was a small amount they will say not to worry, but don't quote me!  Good luck.  I will pray everything is ok! :)|`|OuuYoSBeaa	well now a days things are alot more strict. i grew up eating honey and my parents grew up eating honey and my 7 year old grew up with honey... we are ALL fine, its just since my pregnancy with my 2 year old that i heard this no honey thing. a little bit that your mom gave him isnt going to hurt so i would stop worrying now.|`|ntcETBTQaa	haha our mothers are tooo much arent they... i have a  6 month old and my mom always wanted to give him honey....<br>  she kept saying give him honey..<br>  <br>  until i freaked out and she finally stopped asking ... and does not dare to give our son honey|`|T0gv52CDaa	More than likely, your son is just fine.  The odds of a small drop having enough spores in it to cause a problem are very slim.  That being said, call  your doctor's office and ask them what signs of problems you should be looking for, and for how long.  That will put your mind at ease a lot better than random answers from non-medical professionals on the web.<br>  <br>  As for your mother, I've learned with both my mother & my mother-in-law, the best way for them to learn to follow my rules with my child is to 1 flip out on them (both have felt my wrath at different times) and 2 not had my child back to them until I'm no longer pissed off.  Sometimes that's an hour some times that a couple of days.|`|yea2hci5aa	Usually if your son was going to have an allergic reaction it's within the first 3 days.  It was wrong of your mother to give the honey to him but I don't think it's going to harm your son.  He's 10 months old now and can be consuming a lot more now.<br>  <br>  Sorry you had a scare.|`|qWn2DRtsaa	From a father of 2's perspective.....<br>  <br>  Parents are f**ed up that way.  They think because they give us alcohol and peanuts, and honey that it won't harm the child.  Chances are, it won't -and you're in the claer, the problem now is your mother.  You obviously can't trust her and she is not respecting your rules or wishes as a mother- and that's not cool.  I know it's easy to say, but I would have (diplomatically of course) asked my mother to leave just to show her how serious you are about this.  Otherwise, who knows what's next?  Driving lessons when he's 2??
VbXbxxAnaa	Judo summed up what I was going to say. He is most likely telling his mom what she wants to hear. Maybe set up a rewards system at you house where if he does not lie to his mom he will get a sticker or get to pick something special to do with his dad and you. And talk to him about how bad it makes you feel inside that he is making up these lies about you. Also talk to him about how its not ok to lie and how people that lie get in big trouble especially later in life. That it is important to always tell the truth and that people that tell the truth getting better things in life and so on. Sit down with him and make a list of really fun things that he wants to do. And then remind him that if he makes up lies to his mom that you will not be able to do those fun things with him the next time he comes because he will get them taken away for lieing. Also I would consider getting him into some sort of counseling if his mother is getting him to tell her what she wants to hear that could really hurt him in the long run. I realy hope things get better for you guys!|`|QveBSjFSaa	he is telling his mama what she wants to hear.She may even be "rewarding' him, i.e. special attention because his step-mommy is so "bad' to him, etc.<br>  with my step-daughter, she gets treated to shopping sprees everytime she says something against her father (my husband) or myself.<br>  normal, in this type of situation.<br>  kids learn to play both sides against the middle.<br>  you are right to always want a "witness" around.<br>  I'd like to tell you that it gets better, but there's a good chance that it may not.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	From what you've said here, with him crying when he says he doesn't know why he says those things, I would guess that mom is *encouraging* him to say bad things about you & dad.  That she pushes him & shows pleasure when he says bad things.  <br>  <br>  Mom will never admit this.  Your stepson may not ever admit it, either.  <br>  <br>  I think at this point, the best thing to do is to try to let it all roll off of you.  You & your husband know that you are not doing the things that she is saying that he is saying that you are doing.  You can calmly tell her that these things are not true.  <br>  <br>  But, while I don't condone lying or allowing a child to lie, if this is a survival thing for him (he has to say these things to mom, when she pressures him to do so), then you might want to start having a kind of silent truce on the matter with your stepson.   Sure, defend yourself confidently, but calmly to mom.  And, encourage him to be truthful in every other thing in his life.   But, if you know he pretty much hates doing this, but has to do it to keep mom from flipping out, then don't hold him responsible for doing what he has to do. <br>  <br>  We pretty much did the same with my stepdaughter for years.  Mom would rant about how horrible dad was to force his daughter to spend time with him, ruining her life, tearing her away from family & friends week after week, missing school because she was so sick about dad going in to volunteer in the classroom....   And, dad would nod his head, quietly & walk away.  Or, if necessary, defend himself in a courtroom (with the GAL supporting his claim that stepdaughter, in private conversations with him, states that she enjoys dad's interaction in her life).  <br>  <br>  We knew these things were not true.  We knew that, once in our home (away from the scary transition time, where mom was acting crazy yelling at dad), she was happy, content, had fun with us & with family & friends at our home.  <br>  <br>  So, with my stepdaughter, we just didn't talk about it - didn't ask her to corroborate what mom said, didn't hold her responsible for agreeing with mom when mom insisted or pushed her to do so, didn't ask her to defend dad to mom.  Not her problem.  Her problem was *bigger* - having to lie & pretend about dad, when she truly knew that her mom was wrong & that she loved her dad & her time with him.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I would drop his mom a very sweet note, and this is what I think is going on, hes true to his mom, and is too young to understand its ok to be friends with you, and love his mom too. Id let her know, that you are doing the best you can, and want her to know, you have no intentions of taking over as mom as the childs acting out is seeming to lead to. Hopefully she will understand this. Prove it by not doing anything with the child one week and see if any stories come up, then you can let her know, that something is up. Try not to use the word lie. Good luck on that, its hard for kids, as it is for parents, he sees you as the intruder, the seperator of his parents. His mom needs to discuss the divorce with him more. She may complain about you to her son, so he feeds her fire with tales of untruthes trying to show her compassion.
88cf073c1a10431f8f96825fd98241e8aa	You should check out if you qualify for government health care. I know in CA if you are pregnant you can get health care just for your pregnancy.<br>  I had mine in the Hospital but i did not have an epidural and boy did it hurt. Its like taking a dump and squeezing out brick stones and they did give me a shot 1once but that wore of pretty fast. Really check if you qualify for healthcare while pregnant in your state.

You have to get it at a nutrition store, and it tastes awful, but load it up with sugar and stuff.  Some brands will say "for early motherhood" on the box, but I was 2 weeks late with all 5 of mine.  Had #s 4 & 5 at home.  Best thing I ever did!  The tea strengthens your uterus to do its job... kinda like working out before a marathon.  Not raspberry tea from the store- ra leaf tea.|`|LxrsG8ifaa	I would have the epidural/hospital as a back up option in case the pain gets too bad or there are complications.

I called my dietitian this morning cause my son keeps saying he is hungry and she told me that at that age it is normal to have kids say they are hungry. She told me that he is getting enough to eat because their surviving size is the food that could fit in the palm of their hand.

LxrsG8ifaa	You are most fertile the 24-48 hours after ovulation. After that the egg dies. But you can also get pregnant by having sex in the few days before you ovulate because sperm can survive inside your body for up to 72 hours.|`|fzjePK5Haa	You are the most fertile on the day you ovulate.

But you can get pregnant anytime still but arent as likely too.<br>  <a href="http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/</a>|`|VdS9WE5Faa	A woman is actually most fertile during ovulation. Ovulation lasts for about two weeks and you can usually tell when you start ovulating because you start having vaginal discharge, and sometimes, lots of it. This is when you should avoid having sex if you really don't want to get pregnant. And you are less fertile the week after your period is over because there is no egg to be fertilized.
miPubuDYaa	Some one who has a normal cycle would need to wait 2 weeks. That is when thier period would be due. So if you ovulated on the Feb 14 and you have a 28 cycle your next period should be on Feb 28th. That would be the best time to take the test.<br>  <br>  What you are experiianing could be implantation bleeding. That usual occures 7 - 10 days after conception. Its not as comman as people talk about it. Only happens in about 2 or 3 women out 10. But it is spotting that last for a a couple days<br>  <br>  Your best bet is wait till you miss your period to take a test. And get the double pack just to be sure. Take one first day of your missed period and take the second the next or even 2 days later.|`|UaL28atDaa	It is usually about 3-4 weeks but in the mean time you can take a look at this and see if you are having any of the other symptoms that come with early pregnant.

Just take a $8 test.|`|uuHPneEcaa	There is a chance u could be pregnant. and the spotting could be from implatation bleeding.  Pregnancy symptoms are somewhat the same and ur period symptoms. If u are going to see a doctor tomorrow don't get urself too stressed out okay. Ur not going to feel pregnant. But I am sure u know ur body. <br>  <br>  My symptoms where implatation bleeding ( bleed one day 2 weeks before my period), I was always hungry, tired, tenderness in breast, my period was 5 days late ( always regular), and frequent urination. I also didn't want my boyfriend to touch me in any kind of way.<br>  <br>  and since ur one week late go ahead a take a EPT. I did and it was positive (5 days late)|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Sounds pregnant. I just had a child 4.5 months ago and I was wondering why my period hadn't come this month.I didn't feel pregnant, but I am! Last time I had all the classic symptoms, sore breasts, darker aerola's, sleepy, spotting, and nausea. But this time i didn't feel a thing. So take a home pregnancy to kill the curiosity.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	one week late isnt something to completely freak about yet. if you arent and youre making yourself more nervous youre putting off starting even longer. i would take a digital test to see, they are the easiest to read. the ones with the lines sometimes dont come out clear enough to tell. the brown discharge could have been your period changes in hormone levels can alter it in color or frequency or it could have been implantation bleeding and you are pregnant.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	two weeks late is a good sign of pregnancy forsure. No one feels pregnant early on except for maybe what you are experiencing and some morning sickness after 4,5 weeks along.<br>  Why not take a home pregnancy test, that would releave some of your questions, especially at this point.
C4miEeuYaa	Why were you drinking at 14? Maybe you are paying for it now. That's what guilt is. Let this be a lesson learned for the future.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Well the good thing is that you know better now. You will never really know if you were pregnant or not. I'm pretty sure you can't have a miscarriage by pushing on your stomach. You can't change the past all you can do is make a change for the future. Make sure you never do this again. Also get help with your drinking and put your focus on school.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	You're right about one thing. It's time to forget about the past and move on. I doubt very seriously that you had anything to do with an abortion and I doubt you were even pregnant.  Man, you are way too young to be drinking alcohol, where are your parents?  Look, just use this as a life lesson, but don't keep carrying it around with you.  Move on...the future is in front of you not behind you.|`|102f032dfc7dad2b1b96978795427516aa	too young to have sex.... You need to stop and then there is no chance of you going through this again.  Love yourself and don't think someone else has to have sex with you to be loved.  Love yourself first!  :)|`|WvWFmwQoaa	don't punish your self for it now you wernt ready for a baby you were an alcoholic and needed help to realize that you were a drunk its probably better that you didn't have that baby because you probably would of being a bigger alcoholic, had that baby and been such a big alco that you would of f***ed its life and it would of been even worse besides you don't even know if you were pregnant and you were too young to have one anyway.<br>  you carnt kill something that wasn't there. and you didn't know if it was there its not your fault just think of how much of a screwed up life that baby would of had if you did have it at that time in your life. you were drinking while you were pregnant and you probably would of been still drinking through out your whole pregnancy because you hated that you were pregnant and hated what a baby was going to do to your life. just think of it as a wake up call and move on and try and make the smart choices in life from now. your life is what you make of it so make it worth while with very little things to regret :))|`|uX4FDZnvaa	girl seriously you are so young. you do not need to drink to have fun.<br>  <br>  to be the cramps and bleeding and clumps you decribed does sound like a miscarriage i have had 3.<br>  <br>  you are only 16 hunni dont put yourself down now you have your whole life ahead of you.<br>  <br>  just remember people make mistakes and you learn from your mistakes if you have a brain lol. <br>  <br>  you will have the chance when your older or ready to have a baby.<br>  <br>  my little saying is "you learn from your mistakes so i might make another " lol <br>  <br>  <br>  just go an enjoy yourself and remember you DONT need drink, drugs, you dont even need boys!|`|AA10063059	you cant abort a pregnancy like that,that was just your period and your guilty conscience|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	That's horrible! You were 14, what were you even doing having sex? Unprotected at that. Drinking too huh? Well I don't feel sorry for you. I feel sorry for that unborn child and the fact that you took its life because you are a immature selfish person. I hope you learn from your mistake and in the future you aren't so stupid. I have to question your parents parenting too.|`|CrYc4TTSaa	Aw, honey, I'm so sorry.  The fact that you feel bad about it actually is a good thing.  Try not to let this make you closed off or bitter.  Maybe if you call an abortion alternative (Christian) place or church- and ask for someone who has been there- you can speak with a woman who has experienced something similar and learned how to forgive herself.  Forgiving yourself is not saying it's ok, but allowing to move on.  All people have done things- you need to move through this to a good life.  I'm glad you have made decisions to begin to care for your body.. try to find an older friend or adult who can be there with you also.  Tell God how you feel and ask Him for help with all your needs- there are so many people He loves in the Bible who royally messed up, but He forgives and FORGETS.  He won't ignore your pain, but has good things in mind for you- bluehen@ymail.com|`|XhzwLFieaa	wow girl. that's a difficult situation...i'm sure you're not the only one who's experienced this. I think the best thing to do seriously...and I know it sounds corny, but if you don't want to talk to anybody else about this like a couselor or therapist or even your parents...then maybe you should pray. Again I know it sounds corney. But it may help. However, if you were/are drinking that much so young then you have more problems than just losing a baby. Not that its good you lost a baby, but it's best you don't have a child. You yourself are already a child...you don't need a baby. I'm sure you realize this. I strongly encourage you to talk to somebody about this. Preferably your parents, your mother. She may be more understanding than you realize! Moms have a way of being there for you when you really need them to but you don't think they will.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	MIscarriages happen often and most of the time happen early in pregnancy and (usually) no one knows what causes it and many times there's no way to prevent one - there are many different reasons so you can't assume it was all you.<br>  <br>  You need to stop drinking - you obviously don't know when to stop - do you want to kill yourself?<br>  <br>  You need a counselor asap - they are the ones that can help you get through this. <br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|xsaxyB1gaa	You're young, and yes miscarriages are painful, regardless of the circumstances, both physically and emotionally. I would suggest you talk with a counselor and try to work through this. If you still continue to have a drinking problem, I would ask for help wherever you can get it. I wish you all the best.|`|yea2hci5aa	I'm sorry that you have so much guilt about it but you're just a child.  You aren't even sure if you were truely pregnant so there's no way to know 100% if you did indeed have a miscarriage.  It sounds to me that you should go see someone like a therapist in order to talk to someone you trust.  They can help you make sense of the situation and make you realize that it wasn't your fault.  From now on, you need to be a little bit smarter with your decisions.  Use some type of protection because you are still way too young to have to care for another child.  <br>  <br>  Please talk to someone you trust, getting this off your chest will help you.
KvE6eKWxaa	MMR, usually done around 18 months. Controversial vaccine, doctors swear, and swear, and swear it is safe...I refused it for my son.<br>  Make a knowledgeable decision, and make it your own, don't get pressured into getting it for your child because your Dr. insists its ok.|`|BzBKnlSSaa	The MMR.. that kids get around 16- 18 months.. which happens to be the same time that autism really becomes apparent.. which is what the pediatrician told me when I asked. She said that there is no proof that the MMR causes autism. I am not too sure  myself what to believe.. I'm just not going to give my daughter the MMR till shes about 3 just in case.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	i recently saw on the news a report that the doctor who started the vaccination = autism faked his results . i think all the info is  speculation i would recommend looking at jenny mccarthys website. her son has autism and she has done lots of work|`|VC7PyH53aa	I don't think they're saying it the vaccines but the chemical that added to the vaccine for preservation/stability. I think they're talking about mercury.|`|YR9h8p77aa	Doctors have not made any link to vaccines causing autism, parents of autistic children say that the thermisol in the vaccines caused it.  There is no evidence that that is the case as thermisol hasn't been used in vaccines for about 10 years.  I'm not saying that vaccinations couldn't worsen a pre-exsisting case of autism, but cause it?  I'm not too sure.<br>  <br>  While it may be a possibility that vaccines could cause autism (no hard evidence to support that) think of this, there are a lot of illnesses that are making a strong come-back.  For example, I've added a link that shows you what Whooping Cough sounds like.  I've also added a couple of links about current study into vaccinations and autism.  Autism is not fully understood as of yet, I think it's premature to stop vaccinations and possibly harm our children and others when we still don't understand the condition.  <br>  <br>  All in all, it's the parents choice on whether to vaccinate or not, but if years down the road we find out that caffiene intake by the mother caused it (or something similar) I wouldn't want to be the parent thats child had measels and is now sterile.|`|yPLS0FeWaa	The MMR vaccine and thimerosal (mercury additive) found in other vaccines, which is no longer used.<br>  <br>  **Dr. Andrew  Wakefield is the doctor who associated the MMR vaccine as to causing autism in a report released and published 1998 in The Lancelot, it was later found that he fixed the results and most of those children in the research  had documented signs of autism in their medical records before they recieved the MMR shot. <br>  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_an...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_an...</a>|`|Mh8pATk8aa	for a while people thought mmr increased risk for autism and then they thought thimerisol did. thimerisol was in some vaccines but never in mmr and now it's been removed from everything except the flu vaccine. now scientists have shown neither mmr nor thimerisol increase risk for autism.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	None there is no risk for autism.
3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	I had normal heartburn symptoms before I got pregnant.  They happened everynow and then.<br>  <br>  After I got pregnant, everything gave me pain.  I was going through containers of tums.  <br>  <br>  To ease the pain, watch what you eat, document what gives you pain and don't eat it.  Take Tums or calcium tablets.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what the Doctor can prescribe during pregnancy.  I would definitely talk to him about what you're going through though.|`|cjqOUq5xaa	Yea you had better go to the dr. I have acid reflux (diagnosed by the dr) and I have never had symptoms like that. But I guess there could be different signs. But my dr. gave me protonex
NAIkcKssaa	My son is 18 months just had same virus for 10 days. We use a mixture of things aveeno soothing relief a lot and i mean a lot with Vaseline or aquaphore on top at night. during day we use triple paste for one diaper change and aveeno the next i really goop it on get a good layer between diaper and skin. also regular baby wipes make it more painful. I make my own at this time with soft paper towels and baby wash.also a little air in between changes helps. hope that helps|`|3m40DbqNaa	Put Mylanta, or another antacid liquid medicine (used by adults, but safe when applied on the skin of babies) on his rash with a cotton ball and let it dry before putting a diaper on. It neutralizes the acid and gets rid of the rash pretty quick. Also let him go diaperless as much as possible.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	I always use Butt Paste. That stuff works wonders!! and you can get it just about everywhere :-)<br>  <br>  Also instead of using  baby wipes  (since it can be painful), try just using a wet paper towel instead. Just until his diaper rash clears up a bit so its not so painful.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buttpaste.com/BLButtPaste.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.buttpaste.com/BLButtPaste.php</a>|`|s75QB5GMaa	Make sure it's not a yeast infection first otherwise none of the other remedies will work. You may want to take him to his doctor, and yes baby boys do get yeast infections. If that's the case is will only take a few days with medication to clear up. Good luck, I know how painful it is to watch him in pain.|`|pgBHEesTaa	Use the daiper rash powder or petroleum gelly i am sure you have it at home|`|37af6af737ecf01d20140945cf5cf24aaa	Balmex!

(Approx. $7-8)|`|Hhifw93laa	AIR let him go diaperless for a couple min at a time then when you do put it on put corn starch in there it helps keep the moisture out of the diaper trust me I have 4 kids and 2 of them still in diapers and we just got over the bad flu bug thing to and my 2 kids butts are back to normal try it air and cornstarch the best ever lol <br>  <br>  God Bless|`|uxItOSkmaa	I second the liquid antacid remedy, but I rub it on and then sprinkly tons of pure cornstarch on top.   Like another answerer already said, stop using baby wipes until the rash is clear and makes sure his bottom is completely dry before putting anything on him.|`|AA11327039	If you're willing to put up with the messes, let him go bare bottom most of the day....just clean up any urine or bowel movements as soon as they happen.  Dry him off, add a little Vaseline and let him run.  Fresh air and sunshine (which this time of year is hard to come by) is best|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Rinse his butt with warm water instead of using wipes, which have fragrance and cleaners. Air or pat dry and then use some pure cornstarch. It will keep his diaper from rubbing and will help keep anything from sticking to the sore areas.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	We always used Desetin overnight stuff.  It worked miracles for our kids, and saw my son through the flu at 12 months old.
OpVysSzQaa	its normal, and it stinks. I know, because I normally have a high sex drive, so when the hormones kicked in during my pregnancies, I went insane.<br>  <br>  try every position you can get your body into (comfortably), try anal sex (use caution of course), or rely on oral for a while. the best position for me for a long time at the end of my pregnancy was spooning.<br>  <br>  nothing the docs told me to do decreased the pain at all. so I can't suggest anything in good conscience lol.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would think that the only thing you can do is speak to your doctor about it. She has probably been asked the same thing a million times. Good luck!|`|9fb8dd613b6d7669a254e54dfa56167baa	Do you have to have penetrative sex? I find Sex uncomfortable at mo (23 weeks) so we find other ways of stimulating each other, ie using hands and oral, feels like being a teenager again!

I asked and they told me to just keep trying different positions, but I honestly don't think we can get much more creative lol.
hwRdT156aa	yes that would be your mucus plug.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	it could be your plug...I had the same thing happen to me but it was at 36 weeks. But at my 37 week check up I was dialated 1cm so the nurse said that's probably what it was. Most people don't ever really know for sure unless they are one of the few who an accually solid plug type falls out. Good luck!!!!|`|nowngQiPaa	I a not a doctor, but i have had 4 children.  i am saying it is your mucus plug.  this does not mean you are in labor, but it does mean your body is getting ready for labor.  so take it easy, i would guesstimate you will have your baby by saturday. but that is just a guess<br>  good luck to you
qZ9JeED7aa	If you really want to conceive, you should check out the book below.  It is all about knowing when you are fertile, when you should try, and much more.  Sperm can live in your body for 5 (and I've heard 7 days).  So it is possible for the sperm to still be alive if you ovulate 3 days later.  What you really want to look for is a lot of cervical fluid.  This tells you that you're getting more and more fertile (closer to ovulation).  The key day is the day your cervical fluid is like an egg white.  Also, if you are comfortable, you can check your cervical position.  When you are not fertile, it is firm, closed, and low.  As you get closer to ovulation, it rises up further, gets softer, and opens up. <br>  You can ttc prior to ovulation, but trying after you ovulate, to my knowledge, doesn't do anything.  <br>  Check out this book for more information.  I am currently using the methods in the book to tta instead of ttc.  But, I am excited to have the knowledge for when we are ready to start trying.  It tells you so much about your body that I think is really cool.<br>  Good luck ttc!|`|sstNdyYVaa	yes sperm can live up to 3 days so there is a chance!<br>  <br>  all the best, relax itll happen by the will of god xxx|`|uX4FDZnvaa	well i never get all this ovulation stuff because my periods are so irregular its unbelievable. <br>  <br>  The thing i do is just have sex everyother day or 3 days a week. people will probably thumbs down me i dont know but i have done this 4 times and i have got pregnant in a month or 2 months.<br>  <br>  unfortunatly them 4 pregnancys did not result in a baby  grr :(<br>  <br>  goodluck and hope you get a baby soon hun XxXxXxXxX|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	That sounds right. If you really need help I really do suggest buying the clearblue easy fertility monitor because it tells you all your fertile days and the big ovulation day. I had sex on all of them and got pregnant my first time trying it. I had been trying for 2 1/2 years before that. Good luck and baby dust!|`|AA10063059	they may be inside you yes but they will not be so mobile and active and fertile|`|aJTBF7opaa	www.early-pregnancy-tests.com/ is an easy cheaper way to track ovulation|`|wTYh7DiSaa	Short answer yes. Sperms can live up to 5-6 days inside provided that they are in the most optimal environment. Most of the sperm die with the acid environment of the vagina and does not get the chance to travel up the uterus, but, we are talking about millions of these swimmers.. so no worries, you have more than enough spare to wait. As you know pregnancy is all about timing!|`|V6aH1vpQaa	Yes, the sperm can live days.  But the best thing to do is just have lots of sex.|`|XhzwLFieaa	I think that yes you can. If I'm not mistaken yes you can. Hope you get a lil baby soon!! I just had my baby boy 7weeks ago!

You said shifts so if its the nhs then they defiantly understand but if its not then get a doctors note and even if its not child related illnesses get your doctor to write you a note to show them what you did have, before they can sack you they need to have tones of reasons well that is as long as you have worked there over 6 weeks.|`|6kBNHzSVaa	for 1 if your job knows you are pregnant it shouldn't be an issue if they don't i suggest asking your doctor to write a statement on your condition to give to work
88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	Yeah! Congratulations! Yes, prenatal vitamins are great and a very healthy diet. Calcium is a natural relaxer and important during pregnancy.  Avoid stress and stressful people. Avoid lifting and rest when physically fatigued.<br>  The appointment time sounds average.<br>  <br>  My friend had concerns about miscarriage so she started taking a sublingual b12/b6/folic acid tablet daily and her cramping stopped. She felt this really helped. <br>  She had a miscarriage the year before so she was very concerned.<br>  <br>  She has a beautiful baby girl now.<br>  <br>  Again, Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!|`|k4c24zblaa	Hi Sweetheart, First of all Congratulations, Second just go to the store and get any kind of over the counter Prenatal Vitamins, try to reduce the amount of caffeine you partake a day and just live your life the same way but be careful in a sense that you don't do anything drastic that will harm the baby. Third there is nothing you can do to stop a miscarriage I had one when I was 7 weeks but within 3 weeks I was pregnant again now I'm 3 months. My first appt wasn't supposed to be until I was 10-12 weeks but since I didn't know for sure how far along I was they scheduled it before and when I went to the doctor i was about 9 so yes you should feel privileged that you get to see the doctor as early as what your getting to. That is totally normal! So goodluck!|`|102f032dfc7dad2b1b96978795427516aa	Don't stress.... !  :)|`|OchDUGDgaa	eat healthy and cherish every second cuz your having a baby.. i always wanted a baby and was told it wasn't going to happen well surprise i was 41 when i finally got pregnant and have a 3 year old wonderful boy. i was so nervous but now i know i missed out on little milestones (first time i felt him move) because i was to worried to celebrate so relax and enjoy every second you of this wonderful gift god is giving you CONGRATS....|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Pre-natals YEs!.....no heavy lifting or straining. Stay away from household chemicals/do not keep your belly in hot water over long periods of time. Don't change out your cat's litter box. and make sure all the meat you eat is cooked. Congrats!!!<br>  Soon to be MOM!|`|RPoFBenJaa	you'll be fine. Dont take anything except prenatal vitamins. The more u stress the more you higher you chances of complications.|`|XQIbx7Plaa	First of all relax!  Don't worry.  And rejoice, you are Pregnant!!<br>  They sell over the counter prenatal vitamins, in the vitamin section.  Be sure to eat healthy and stay hydrated.  Take care of yourself, and the baby will be fine.<br>  It is also great to keep yourself informed and know about the babies development, you can get a pregnancy book just about anywhere books are sold...<br>  This is all so routine for Doctors, they deal with pregnant women on a daily basis, so often they are not very sensitive about telling you things like this in a kind way.  <br>  Chances are your baby will be fine, but if you do miscarry there is nothing that you can do or could have done to prevent it, and worrying is not going to help.  I am a firm believer that the more relaxed you are the better it is for the baby.<br>  So go and celebrate, have dinner with your husband.<br>  Congrats!<br>  ps start tracking all of the fun moments too, it is always fun to have a pregnancy keepsake book
rTaaIXSuaa	That's up to the baby. lol|`|vue9NOhYaa	Of course many women 'take this long.'  The 'average' for a first time mother is, in fact, not 40 weeks, but about 41 weeks.  <br>  <br>  You will almost certainly go into labor sometime in the next 7-10 days.  And no, there will be no pain from going a bit 'late' than if you'd gone into labor on your due date. <br>  <br>  If you reach 42 weeks without signs of labor beginning, the doctor will probably discuss induction. But, until/unless that happens, don't fret.  Your body will go into labor when it's ready.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	How many weeks pregnant are you?  You will go into labor when the baby is ready.|`|AA11612508	i never went past my due date, i was always induced. But i was also 3 cm dialated for a month before the induction. And clearly my baby was big enough and developed enough for an induction. If your doc says just roll with it without inducing, like today, i would say trust his judgement. The baby does better every single day they are in the belly. just rest right now if you can!!!|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Technically your pregnant for 10 months ie 40 weeks.<br>  Exactly how far along are you week wise?<br>  Everyones pain level is different.<br>  Talk to your doctor.|`|CrYc4TTSaa	Take a look at the calendar- you won't pass the next full moon|`|mldo1vxYaa	Whoa whoa whoa, calm down!!! Everything is fine, this happens almost every woman especially on their first child. Nothing is wrong, very few people actually give birth on their due date. Remember your due date is just an estimate, the baby will come when he or she is good and ready.<br>  <br>  And no you wont have more pain lol Your waters might not break at all, not everyones waters break naturally. Either contractions or water breaking could happen, dont worry you are fine.|`|qmNZnmzeaa	my mom told me to take a laxitive and go for a brisk walk to help start my labor. because when u go for a brisk walk it wakes up your bowels and the laxitive helps everything get flushed out for 2 reasons. 1 because when your bowels r completely empty it allows to baby to move down in you pelvic more and 2 because you dont want to have an accident while pushing out your baby. i did the lax and walk and went into natural labor with contractions within 24 hours of me flushing everything out for my first and second pregnancy so maybe you should try it  good luck and early congrats|`|MMj7YcXkaa	I am sure that your dr will induce you when you are 2 weeks overdue.  I know some women who went 1 month over.  No reason to be scared!  My sister and friend had to be induced.  IT was their first child and some women need help starting the process.  Just walk WALK WALK. If you can, have sex too.  Make sure he comes inside you because the sperm has this stuff in it that makes some women go into labor. And the pain is the same.  It just is a little faster because the drug they use to induce makes harder faster contractions.|`|Vj7OtluBaa	hi, my second daughter was nearlly two weeks late , i went in for a routine app. and as i got up out of the waiting room chair my waters broke and made the whole waiting room laugh, my contractions started almost straight away and she was born 6 hrs later, good luck:)

781d71752d258090b69b654451d07ecfaa	I am 22 weeks with a girl and I am having just a really great pregnancy. I've had NO morning sickness and have felt great. In the first trimester I was tired alot but now much less. Like you said, I can't wait to have a belly cause mine is still really small. I bet though once  have it I will want it gone so I can be more comfortable too. I mostly am feeling happy and excited but am super emotional too. I think once it gets close I'll be nervous about the birth because the hospital I'm going to does not do epidurals so I don't have that as an option. I notice too that everyone is so much nicer and people bring me cookies just to be nice (though I ish they would stop!) and I get first dibs at the bathroom which is awsome! Anyways so far so good! Hope your delivery goes great!|`|FeMJDEcIaa	I am 32 and 1/2 weeks along.. and LOVING IT!!<br>  I haven't had the cravings so many other woman talk about or been as emotional.. I had one moment a few weeks ago where i started freaking out about labor but other than that my pregnancy has gone super smooth.  I've gained about 40 lbs, but most all of it is in my belly.  My boobs starting "leaking" (i guess you would call it) last night but it wasn't much though it did freak me out a little... <br>  <br>  oh and I'm having a boy! He is due April 20th.<br>  I am mostly ecstatic about bringing life into the world....<br>  <br>  <br>  Hooray for pregnant ladies!!<br>  <br>  wishing you the best|`|l46COY9eaa	Congrats to you! Well I am about 7 weeks along, my boobs hurt, I am having food aversions to raw meats (I can't stand to open the fridge, all the smells blending together...blarf!..no nothing is going bad in there! I just have recently developed super sensitive smelling ability)-so I don't want to cook. I am exhausted just getting out of bed, but at least I am not peeing as much as I did in the first few weeks! (I got up like 5 times a night). I wonder if everything I eat or do is OK, I wonder if I'll be a good mom, I wonder if I am in fact carrying twins will I be able to handle it, I have all the usuall "wonders".|`|rnTNu6MTaa	Hi am 40 weeks today due with a baby girl :) and i can't wait to hold her and look into her eyes for the first time. She is our first baby and my husband is so excited :) even this morning he was talking to the baby asking her if she wants to come out today...lol. The phone is hooked on him ....and his teammates at work the same in case i call. It's very funny. We are very happy and we can't wait to begin our journey as parents. Good luck with your baby and hope you have an easy delivery and ur baby is healthy!!!|`|MtC3CWZraa	I was due last Thursday. Other than being exhausted because I'm no longer capable of getting a full night's sleep, I am willing to agree to pretty much anything my doctor wants to do that will get this child out!!! I don't care how much it hurts. I just need to be done. I'm not the least bit scared of labor at this point.|`|buoqtZeFaa	Well I will be 30 weeks tomorrow YAY! lol.  I think I am getting a little bit more nervous everyday.  On one hand I am so ready to meet my little girl them on the other hand I am sooooo scared to go into labor.  I just keep thinking that something will go wrong.  I like you want to be able to sleep on my stomach again because that's just how I am use to sleeping.  my DR. has put me on restrictions to only lay or sleep on my left side which is SUPER uncomfortable at this point.  I think this will be my first and last lol.  Other than that I am just all around excited lol.
iR9w7d7Yaa	It's disgusting. Just small-minded people making an issue as they have nothing better to do. What if their child was born with one arm? I think children need to know from a young age that everyone is different.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	all i have to say about that is the parents that are complaining are simply TOO LAZY to talk to their children about acceptance and disabilities. these are the same people who are going to be wondering 'where did i go wrong' when their kids come home pregnant at 15 because they didn't want to have 'the talk' too soon. people ARE dumb and close minded. i think it is a wonderful idea to have different types of people from different walks of life on children's programs. it encourages discussions that may not otherwise happen. people are just (again) TOO LAZY to deal with REAL issues of REAL life!|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Whatever happened to parents teaching their kids tolerance for people with handicaps? That's wrong, if it was their child with only one arm, they would be outrage if he/she wasn't accepted, even as an adult. But because it makes THEM uncomfortable, she should be hidden away? People need to learn compassion and understanding. What are they teaching kids about acceptance if they as adults can't accept someone based solely on physical appearance? I feel sorry for their kids.|`|sgMno1PRaa	stupid people!!|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Children are hardwired to shun people who don't look the same and who might have disabilities with an evolutionary reason - people who are born different clearly have a genetic problem, which the hardwiring of children see as being a threat to the continuation of the species.  In the old days, chlidren with disabilities were often left to die after being born.<br>  <br>  So we as parents have to teach children that we are now part of a society that does accept people with disabilities as we are caring and sharing.<br>  <br>  However, children will continue to be horrible to or scared by anyone different.  They can't help it.  <br>  <br>  An adult CAN help it and to post something on a BBC board like that is appalling.  The man should be ashamed of himself.<br>  <br>  Why am I getting thumbs down?|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Wow, no wonder our world is full of so many prejudices. Parents are teaching their children to ridicule and be fearful of things that are different instead of explaining the differences to them. What a shame that there are so many closed minded people out there. I wish I knew some of those people so I could set them straight. It is NEVER too early to talk to your children about differences and there is no safer place for them to ask then in their own home. It's way better then them asking out on the street when they pass someone with a disability (we all know how loudly our children can ask questions at the most inappropriate time) and making someone feel badly. Although we don't have access to her programs where I live I wish that my kids had the chance to watch her so that they weren't surprised when they saw someone with her same disabilities.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Have just asked a similar question myself when I saw the story, and then answered another on the subject in between then and now.<br>  <br>  All it does is highlight the ignorance of the parents I'm afraid.  Discrimination like this is unacceptable.  If they can't manage this situation as parents they really didn't ought to be allowed to have children!<br>  <br>  Edit: At one time ethnic minorities wouldn't have been allowed on too, but that changed years and years ago.|`|b3889ee355f01fc906d1159fd12fa66daa	I totally agree with you!

Who ever these people that are putting in these complaints are really need to go and get lives and cop on to themselves. there a disgrace|`|J7ZZL1bCaa	I agree, here's the story for anyone who hasn't heard it..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20090223/tuk-one-armed-cbeebies-host-scaring-chil-45dbed5.html">http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20090223/tuk-...</a><br>  <br>  What if a child was 'scared' of someone with a turban on a children's quiz show, or someone with a black face on Blue Peter...would they lose their jobs??...no way.....neither should this girl.|`|a35650a2d4dd8438b175c12703752380aa	Some people can't see past there own nose's these thing need to be taught to children at an early age that everyone is different and we are not all perfect what will these people be like when their little darling go into the real world they can't shield them for ever by making these comments or stopping the children watching the programme will only make the kids ask more questions ,hope that he parents never have a disabled child how will they explain that to their other children or will they just switch it off as if it were not their put it in another room the parent have alot of growing up to do my children are too old to be wathcing these types of programmes now but when i catch them starring at some one different they are always made to apologise<br>  Live and let live i say|`|bHjxnGyOaa	Completely wrong. The parents are just sad people who haven't grown up and can't face life little tragedy's. If they don't like it, don't let their kids watch it.

I cannot believe people would be so shallow! <br>  I don't have children I am only 20 but i would deff wouldnt even think about letting or not letting them watch her or anyone else on tv! the fact that she only has one arm shouldnt come into anything!<br>  i am totally digusted at the moment after reading that,|`|B8yKpGUnaa	I agree, these parents should be embracing the opportunity to educate their children about disabilities, not hiding it from them.|`|AA11364095	Lets be honest, it's not the disablity its the bad acting which is scaring everybody|`|6T4SvlMOaa	thats horribal. <br>  the kids r gonna grow up learning people will have disabilitys and only one arm or one leg or w/e<br>  <br>  poor gal. gettin complaints in for tht|`|4UeQlNqMaa	yes i think this is awful too..i dont believe for one minute that the children are scared or could have nightmares, i think its the parents laying this on them because they shocked to see it, i child is very open minded and they dont judge, they ask questions, if my daughter asked me why she has an arm like that i would just tell her because were all different, cant believe its caused so many awful comments, i dont think there is anything wrong with her and the cbbc channel shouldnt be criticised for hiring her.
1c32b2a7f08aa2dc2fd8c1ccbe87d1c6aa	I'm not familiar w/ the anomaly scan either.<br>  For constipation - check w/ your doctor but you should be able to take like Metamucil or something like that.  That should be safe for the baby.  In the mean time - prune juice and lots of water to try to soften it.<br>  It's normal w/ your second or third or subsequent pregnancies not to talk to much about the pregnancy.  You both know what's going on and what stage is next.  Although it is still exciting w/ every baby, it's not "new" meaning - it's not the first time you've been through it.  I know that you and him and both still excited about this baby and I'm sure you do show it, but you're experienced parents now, you know what to expect.  Keep talking about it as much as you want to - I'm sure your hubby feels the same way.<br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|M5HyStReaa	there are generally 2 anomoly scans - at 12 weeks for dating and for down's syndrome, and at 20 weeks for head formation, check all the limbs are there, cleft lip, formation of heart and kidneys, placement of placenta and blood flow.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	The only answer I can give you to all of your questions is about the constipation.  My doctor told me its normal and if it really becomes a problem to take a stool softener.  They said it will not affect the baby at all.|`|7edddef837f9013ff2f1f46a6893dcb7aa	I'm not familiar with the term 'anomaly scan', but I assume it's either an amniocentesis or nuchal fold scan to look for chromosomal abnormalities.  I had an amniocentesis at 19 weeks because of an abnormality that showed up on an ultrasound of my daughter's heart. (fortunately, it turned out to be a harmless calcium deposit.) These tests analyze the fetal DNA taken from either a sample of amniotic fluid or else cells from the nuchal folds.  These tests can determine whether the fetus has the correct number of each chromosome and can detect several of the more common chromosomal disorders such as Down Syndrome.  The scan is typically done around 13 - 15 weeks of pregnancy so that if it reveals a severe birth defect (very rare) the expectant parents can decide whether to continue or terminate the pregnancy.In the past, these tests had a complication rate of about 1%.  Now - at least in the US - the compliation rate is about 1 in 600.    The amniocentesis was uncomfortable, but not really painful. <br>  <br>  As for the constipation - drink LOTS of water (3 - 4 liters a day, minimum), eat green leafy vegetables, eat dried fruit, and don't eat much cheese.  If these things don't work ask your doctor to prescribe a stool softener/laxative.  Some prenatal vitamins - especially those with iron - can 'plug you up'.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|v3LnJycKaa	i thought apples, cheese, bananas, rice all bind you???? Try prunes, or plums, grapes, etc... more fluids... or a stool softner. I thinkt he anomaly scan is just the Nuchal translucency scan they do here in the states, it basically checks the growth and development to this point and measure the fold on the back of the babies neck as a downs marker..|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	For the constipation: try a big glass of prune juice before bed. When you get up in the morning, mix a teaspoon of benefiber into whatever you drink. (fibresure is another brand of the exact same thing- it's tasteless and textureless fiber, you just add it to a glass of water, for example, and you wouldn't even know it's there. Promise.) Have a small bowl of 100% bran cereal. Drink a lot of water and voila! The problem is always solved for me, and I have had baaad constipation. Good luck!
pvH3oHRfaa	I've been breastfeeding for 6 months, and I've had one period in that time. It wasn't much of a period, but it was something. I do sometimes get period pains as well but no bleeding.<br>  <br>  I think it's just one of those things when you're breastfeeding. They will probably return to normal once you have weaned baby.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm quite glad I'm still not getting them!|`|vue9NOhYaa	it would be VERY rare for a nursing mom to get a period a month after giving birth.  The bleeding you had then was probably lochia, or some women do get what appears to be a light period at around 6 weeks post-partum, and then see nothing more for many months.<br>  <br>  I'd say that you have nothing to worry about.  The average for getting a first period when breastfeeding is about 9 months. If the test was negative, and you're using contraception (either LAM [lactational amenhorrhea method] or some other method), the odds of pregnancy are very low.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	When breastfeeding it is common to not have a period at all.

You could also just look for something that is tight right below the breasts and is loose the rest of the way down.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Yep, go to a bridal salon and get a maternity-style bridesmaid's dress.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	lol sorry saw this a lmao <br>  do an net search|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	You might consider having one made.  Look at patterns at a local fabric store for maternity clothes.  There are bound to be some styles that are dressy, they may be short, but you can always lengthen them.  <br>  If you find a style you like, then it's just a matter of selecting the fabric and finding a skilled seamstress to make it for you.  People at the fabric store may be able to give you referrals.|`|AA11612508	i would say dont buy anything yet of course. you change by the week in size when pregnant i swear. I would wait until about two weeks out, and just shop in same section. i have found that clothes while pregnant do not have to be "maternity" just find a dress that fits. search local mall, not sure what you would have in oklahoma|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I'm gonna hold my tongue on this one.....<br>  <br>  You just simply need a dress with an empire waist that flows away from the body.  There are tons of prom dresses in this style.  Look online if there aren't any dress shops around where you live.  I always got all my prom dresses from JCPenney's.  Although pregnancy and prom were never two words I put hand-in-hand, I do recall there being tons of dresses that would fit a pregnant girl.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You may just have to get a stretchy dress or something. It will probably show off your belly more but it would work. You may also try a plus size dress and then just get it altered to fit you around the chest. You'll just have to wait until then and try on dresses and just get them altered a bit. Good luck!|`|4XfjUcvDaa	You would prob have to go to a bridal shop and get a maternity bride's maid dress.  If you want something more casual then go to Motherhood and get a simple dress. It wont be fancy but a lot less cheaper.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I had to buy a dress for my company Christmas party and I found one on ebay that was normally around $200 and I got it for about $30.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Yea you can get an empire dress.|`|9AUmp5jWaa	Your parents must be so proud....|`|lY2XI8kUaa	have you tried going to motherhood at the mall? they may have some dresses there. or you can try looking online.<br>  www.motherhood.com is their website address a pea in a pod will also have some nice dresses <a href="http://www.apeainthepod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apeainthepod.com/</a>|`|94kNwMPdaa	you could always wear those long straight silky dresses. get a size you fit in. you'll look beautiful in it and it'll illuminate your baby bump. here's a website you can look at<br>  <br>  i cant get the link for some reason<br>  <br>  but go to davidsbridal.com then click on prom. then all styles under the dress dropdown menu and a dress like the long pink one second from last on the second page would look good|`|oWAUb6vpaa	I don't live anywhere near Oklahoma, but: <br>  <br>  If you can't have one made, buy one that is loose (and flowing) from the waist down that way as your belly grows, you'll still fit into your dress at prom. <br>  <br>  Have fun and congratulaions mom.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	You can go to Deb and get the dresses that are tight around your boobs but then loose everywhere else.  They are called BabyStyle dresses.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	you'll probably have to geta bridesmaid dress they make maternity ones and they do have cute ones my mom owns a dress shop|`|SNVauR3laa	I was two weeks from my due date at prom. I got my dress at Motherhood Maternity. It wasn't very fancy, but it was acceptable, and honestly, I don't think that the people that were staring were talking about my dress. It was also cheaper than a bridal shop, and I was saving all I could for baby. Good luck to you.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	get one w/ an empire waist w/full skirt like w/tulle as the underskirt and have the upper top of the prom dress draw aten to your shoulders, bustline, maybe a backless style.(like a babydoll backless) so u can still look good w/o looking maternity style. like get the dress in a length that shows off legs &wear hi stilettoes 2 lengthen leg even more. (if stilettoes have a platform, they will be easier 2 walk on cuz the plat form will give stability. and get ankle strap ones 4 more prettyness. think babydoll coctail lenghth dress. w/lots of prettly fluff/fullness in skirt. and long"shoulder duster" crystal earrings would draw atten tion 2 face, neck , hair &would be a beautiful touch 2 complete the look.

tLGbtmGsaa	I would get your heart checked out.  Anything that affects the function of your heart can make you feel more fatigued than normal.  I don't mean to scare you but 2 months before my dad had a heart attack he was feeling really fatigued and had no energy.  So for the sake of your health get your heart checked.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	I felt the same way, when I was exclusively breastfeeding. You are giving lots of energy to your daughter, so you need lots of energy coming in, so stick to healthy, energy rich food. This is the time for a large steak with mashed potatoes, pancake or ham and eggs for breakfast, chicken soup with fresh veggies and the like. Make sure you have easy and fast snacks around: Nuts and raisins in a bowel on the table, yogurt with cream on top and smoothies in the fridge and so on. Whenever you feel hungry, eat! You'll have time enough to diet, when baby is partly on solids.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I hate when people write answers to get the questioner all scared and worried about a new condition... so I'm not trying to do that... just give you an option to check out.<br>  <br>  Low Thyroid (Hypothyroidism) is very common after pregnancy.  And exhaustion is a leading symptom.  There is a medication that you can take to regulate this and it will improve things.<br>  <br>  It is a simple blood test to check, and/or you can just discuss it with your dr.  Also, google it and see if you have any of the other symptoms.  Good luck!|`|T0gv52CDaa	For as long as you are breastfeeding, you should still be taking your prenatal vitamins, that may help some.  Also, breastfeeding uses a lot of energy.  It may seem like you are just sitting on the couch holding her, but I know I still fall asleep almost as quickly as my son (also 3 1/2 months) does.  It burns so much calories, that if you are using weight watchers to lose weight and are breastfeeding, they add 10 extra points to the amount you should be eating daily.|`|OpVysSzQaa	I have longterm sleep deprivation, so breastfeeding my 6mo has been draining.<br>  <br>  try aquafina vitamin+plus. I find it to be revitalizing and its perfectly okay to drink while nursing! also, you can increase your sugar intake.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	Honestly, I didnt regain any energy until after 6 months..(once she started solids) <br>  But prior to that believe it or not..if you can do even 10 minutes of cardio a day and get your heart rate up it gives you TONS of energy..its what got me through! Also..a protein shaked with fruits blended in..always gives me a boost that caffeine just cant match.<br>  <br>  And next to that, what you eat makes a huge diffference the more, prepacked processed foods you eat, the more sleepy they will make you feel..fresh fruits, meats, etc etc..WILL up your energy level.
MW18liqTaa	My son prefer's my breast.<br>  He will occasionally take a bottle and we use Avent BPA free.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	dont use avent!!! they leak constantly and are a big pain in the butt! i used them for my first son and forgot how much i hated them and recomended them to my friend and she had the same problem. in the meantime i had another baby and tried using them again and even called the company about the bottles and their suggestions didnt help at all. they are too expensive and totally not worth it! i ended up using walmart brand bottles and they worked fine-i never once threw them across the room in frustration!!|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	We have always used Playtex Avance with a Medela nipple (our daughter is very particular). They are curved in a way that helps to reduce colic. If you are going to stick with the drop-ins, why don't you try going to generic liners instead of the brand name ones? I know that once a baby gets used to one type of bottle, it's really hard to switch. However, if you go to Walmart (or a similar large chain), they should have a generic brand of liners that will say what type of bottles they can be used in.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I hated Avent myself, they leaked for us. Soothie bottles are okay but not GREAT. We used both of these until we started with Playtex drop ins.<br>  <br>  It's not really that expensive, IMO, but I also don't know your financial situation. We were using Target's brand of liners when we were using the drop ins(he's on sippy cups now) and spent $6 twice a month when he was younger and once a month when he get older(this was for 100 liners). I just liked the fact that we could squeeze the air out and not have to worry about any of it getting into Noah's belly.<br>  <br>  I've heard good things about Dr. Browns bottles too.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I had answered your question earlier<br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3247622&CAWELAID=255656008" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  These use the same nipple as the playtex drop ins, if you think that is going to be an issue, but they don't need the drop ins and you would already have extra nipples to use from the drop ins.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Playtex Drop In hands down I love that bottle. I also like the glass bottles by gerber.|`|odu4jOx3aa	the ones at the dollar store.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I also prefer the Playtex bottles with the Playtex drops ins. Like you... I was finding it getting expensive to buy the drop ins. I tried "Parent's Choice" drop ins which fit Playtex bottles and I have been using them ever since. They are half the price of the Playtex drop ins and work just as good. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.parentschoiceformula.com/baby-bottle-liners.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentschoiceformula.com/baby...</a><br>  <br>  I have been saving a lot of money from switching to Parent's Choice. I even use Parent's Choice diapers and wipes now.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	I personally LOVE the Playtex Drop-Ins...They reduce the amount of air baby takes in which causes less gas. Me, personally, Im willing to spend just a little extra if it causes my baby less tummy aches, and if your baby takes them well, why not just keep him on them?<br>  <br>  However, if it is really a financially struggle, you could try the soothie bottles since he takes the pacifier really well.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	My son wouldn't take any bottle but the Avent.  My 3 1/2 month old daughter is exclusively breast fed.  The few times she has to take a bottle, she won't.  Until recently when I decided to find a bottle the same shape of her pacifier.  It worked like a charm.  Try buying one of both (if you can afford it) and see which one he likes.  Good luck!|`|CsnIpuNvaa	Born Free is the best.  I use the glass bottles, which are easier to clean and stay cleaner than plastic.  It is BPA free as well.  My son rarely spits up.  I just use the sam e glass bottle and change the nipple every six weeks, as recommended.  I have to buy a new nipple ring, though, and may have to buy a whole bottle because I don't think it comes separately.|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	i think the best bottles are from the brand the first years . they have them only at target a pack of three for only 5.99 they have winnie the pooh on them . they are the slim bottle . i used to buy avent but my son hated those . i found these at target and he loved them easy for him to hold to. he has used these ever since .|`|dnEmjUkNaa	i like the dr. browns, but they are just so time consuming to clean and put together. i used soothies with my son and never had a problem with them. i really liked them and plan to use the same kind with any other children i may have.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Dr Browns by far. They help with gas and colic. They helped so much with my sons gas.|`|EhGR05Etaa	I have always used the playtex ventaires also...they are expensive...but I have noticed that if I buy the 3 pack it's a better deal.  I just like them because they cut back on the air baby gets while earting, which cuts back on gas a lot.  Plus I just really liked the shape...made it easy for me to hold and when my son started holding his bottle it was easy for him also.  All babies are different though as I'm sure you know....go with whatever works best!  Good Luck|`|S6QpB8QZaa	My favorite bottle when my son was born was the Dr. Browns. He had awful gas problems and they helped out a lot. I liked them so much I am going to use them when the new baby gets here. They are a bit expensive to buy but in my opinion they are worth it. If you don't want to spend that much wal-mart sells their own version of the Dr. Brown bottles but they are harder to clean.|`|yea2hci5aa	Hands down the best bottles are the born free bottles.  The flows of the nipples are perfect and they're bpa free.  They are a bit more expensive but totally worth it!  All you have to do is sterlize them, I was paranoid and sterilized them between each use, but they're easy to use and are fantastic.  My daughter loved them!|`|VrPyp1APaa	I prefer the playtex drop-ins.  They have worked the best for my son.  I usually buy the store brand drop-ins because they are cheaper than the playtex ones.|`|gvdoMC1baa	I love the Playtex Ventaire. You mentioned that you use those as well as the Drop Ins. Why change bottles and add that expense?
4XfjUcvDaa	I am almost positive that HPT tests have become alot more accurate now a days then years ago.  I am not sure why you have missed your period, or even the fact that it seems that you are pregnant but the test came back negative.<br>  <br>  Personally, I wouldn't waste my money on another test I would call the doctor right away and request a HCG blood test.

AA11327222	Mirena does not cause weight gain. But can cause acne. ALso Mirena makes you less interested in sex. I had Mirena, was great for about 9 months then I started to get bad migranes, back pain, cyst all the time, and bleeding was not stopping, no sex drive . I have the bleeding problem with everything though. I got off of it due to all the side effects.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I have the mirena and I have had a year and an half now , I have no problems with wieght gain.BUt my friend said she gained wieght on it but she also wasent eating healthy. <br>  I dont know personally cause like I said I didnt gain any with it, and I am quick to gain weight , I gained 20 when I got on the pill but not with this. I love the IUD
GfG6wupTaa	Yes, anything is possible. Have a blood test done, you could be anemic. It happened to me and I just chalked it up to menapause, but after ablood test, my doctor said I was anemic and it causes excessive bleeding.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Yes you can. This happens more often with younger women in their teens though, but it's happened to me (29).|`|102f032dfc7dad2b1b96978795427516aa	some times it is due to stress or changing in your life.  Yes it can happen!  :)|`|t0Xdw5gxaa	yes you can have 2 periods a month. wait til next month and if your periods are still strange, go to the doctor. it could be nothing but you need a check up just in case. oh and my aunt had a period for two months and nothing was really wrong with her that was life threatening, it just sucks. Doctors can give u birth control to regulate your period. but like i said before, it happens sometimes and please dont freak out over it.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Yes, it is possible.  You need to see your gynecologist and let him/her know what's going on with you.  They can do an exam to make sure all is OK with you and put your mind at ease.  Good luck.  I hope this helps.|`|gdnL63ngaa	it could also have been implantation bleeding.<br>  was the 2nd "period"very light? If so take a preggo test.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Yes yo can get pregnant but chances are slim because you're not as fertile right before your period.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	yep, all it takes is forgetting one time.|`|odu4jOx3aa	holy dumbass... YES you idiot <br>  not taking your birth control= being pregnant|`|i8Ch743Laa	Yup,you sure can,and may end up that way.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes|`|C4miEeuYaa	You sure can|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	You can get pregnant even if you remembered to take it. It's not 100% effective. So now that you forgot to take it it's even less effective for the time being. Double up with another form of bc for the next few weeks just to be on the safe side.|`|osj6pGzJaa	Well, if you forgot to take your birth control and then you have sex without any other form of protection, the answer to that is a big; YES!|`|gDuDNeRcaa	oh nah. you should be completely fine.|`|zYnArpdIaa	Yes you can, use condoms now or if you had sex and you are worried go to a doctor.|`|dtHjJah5aa	YES....use protection....AKA-Condoms.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Yess a friend of mine got pregnant with all 3 of her kids because she "forgot" to take it one day.|`|102f032dfc7dad2b1b96978795427516aa	yes, but unlikely!  :)|`|4XfjUcvDaa	yup-u can still get pregnant while taking the birth control as well|`|05OjWUyCaa	Did you have sex the day before or that day that you forgot to take it? And if youre taking the pill then it sounds like you were probably on your last week of pills for the cycle which are actually just sugar pills that you are supposed to take just to stay in the habit of taking the pill. So basically you wouldn't be taking birth control pills anyways bc if you were you wouldn't get your period. I wouldn't worry about it because the way the birth control works is during that last week of placebo pills you still have enough of the birth control dose in your body to ward off pregnancy. In fact generally its very difficult to get pregnant for the entire month after you stop taking birth control pills because of that same reason though there are exceptions.|`|5jCLzhGdaa	By the sounds of things you didn't use protection. I'd be more worried about chlamydia than anything else, as there is only a very small likelihood you would have fallen pregnant. Still get tested thoug. Good luck.|`|yCWjBrjnaa	Quite simply yes.<br>  <br>  Consult your doctor.  Also the effects of Alcohol can stop the pill from working also being sick (Vomiting) this may aslo stop the pill from working.  <br>  <br>  Best advice, consult your Doctor sooner the better<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|A2G9foewaa	Umm yeah you can for that matter you can get pregnant while on birth control it is never 100% effective.|`|HuSlCMC6aa	Yup! Take a test as soon as you can.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	DUH!  YES.  Thats the same as asking If I have unprotected sex, can I get pregnant!|`|lY2XI8kUaa	yes you can|`|QfitgXqSaa	of course! birth control is already not that dependable but missing a dose would make it even worst|`|O5KOwhovaa	Yes.|`|ntef2sPMaa	Yes. What kind of birth control do you take?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You sure can!|`|SIp415MFaa	if you have unprotected sex yes|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	yes|`|FlzU20bLaa	yeah...|`|OpVysSzQaa	yep
uFrqC4Y2aa	I had those same symptoms when I first found out|`|VEkkn2Otaa	no one can answer that for sure unless you have a pregnancy test|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Sounds like you could be. You basically described what I was like with my first child. But I would take a test to make sure. :)

rC6gL7KOaa	I knew I would be that way so to avoid the disappointment, I didn't buy anything, I tried not to think of baby names, and I tried not to think of any color schemes or designs for the room. Deep down I wanted a girl and I had to ask myself how I would deal with it if I found out it were a boy. If I were you, I would think of all the good things about having a boy. Playing catch with his father, being his #1 fan at all of his sporting events, and being the "Queen Bee" of the house isn't all that bad. Don't worry, when the baby comes,you will love that baby and be a wonderful mom. Oh I am having a girl.|`|WmKjeUELaa	We haven't found out the sex of our baby yet.  But, we would love to have a girl, although if its a boy, we will love it just the same.  We just want a healthy baby.  Some parents feel exactly the same way you do.  Sometimes I wonder how I will raise a boy if I have one because I am not used to baby boys, just baby girls.  I'm sure your motherly instincts will kick in and you will be just fine.  =)|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	no you are not a bad mother. my first child i was told that it was a boy i bought everything blue and after i gave birth it was a girl. the easy way to cope with dis is by reminding yourself of ow much you wanted a baby and be it a boy or a girl they are all babies.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I wanted a girl SO BAD! In fact I started to tear at the ultrasound when the technician said CONGRATS ITS A BOY!  Still i wish that it was a little girl inside me, but its not.  I love my baby with all my heart and feel that sometimes I am over reacting that I want a little girl.  I get depressed when i go to a clothing store and see 5 rows for girls clothes and like 2 racks with boys clothes.<br>  <br>  I have heard that this is completely normal and that as soon as the baby comes your mind goes in spins and you forget all the worries that you have had during the pregnancy.  And NO MATTER WHAT you will love the child.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	You are not a bad mother! This is so normal. You have mass amounts of hormones shooting around inside you! You wanted a girl and its a boy. This happens a lot. But you are still happy you are having a child and this makes you a good mom.I think you will come to terms with it. Start shopping in the boy section and have your husband go shopping with you for decorations. You will be happy. Especially when you see your sons face for the first time. You will instantly forget about that girl you have been wanting. Congratulations!|`|ZKkZWiM9aa	no your not a bad mother,just wait til your babies born,the feelings will come then,its probably a mix of anxiety too,any way i was told my daughter was a boy,they dont always get it right unless done through amnio test.|`|vjoyv5J6aa	I am having a boy also. I really wanted a girl, but I never got anything until I knew what I was having. There are some items... girl or boy that I wanted. I wasn't going to go pink crazy. I chose a neutral theme, Under the Sea. If it was a girl I was going to add more pink fish, but the room was still going to be a bright blue either way. They have some cute and adorable boy clothes now.... yeah its not a frilly pink dress, but they are cute. Boys, I hear, are really close to their mommies. Girls are typically daddy's little girl. Its kinda nice being the only girl in the house and my boys (son and hubby) can spoil me. Think about the positives. I'm due in 6 weeks.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i found out i was having my 3rd boy and was a little dissapointed, but it only lasted about a week. it wasnt that i was sad i was having another boy just sad i wasnt having a girl-if that makes sense. i think you need to realize that you might have a lot of expectations about your pregnancy or bringing the baby home that wont come out the way you want them to. as a woman of course i wanted to pick out some girly things that i like or buy pink clothes but my sons are the best thing ever and i wouldnt trade one of them for a girl! you will love this baby so much when it is born and never give it another thought that he isnt a girl. try to be excited about what you have instead of sad for what you dont-life is 99% perspective and 1% circumstances|`|QSodlfMraa	no you just had your mind on something and something else same along, be thank full giving the fact you tired for 5 years i would say.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I wanted a boy, also...but we got a girl.  It took me one hour to get excited.  I was so happy when I bought her first bibs...That said DADDY'S GIRL.  I know I was looking forward to basketball games and football and haircuts instead of ponytails. but God doesnt make mistakes and you should be happy that you are getting a bouncing baby boy.  You will get the hang of it.  I did!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	21 weeks girl (shes 21 months now) <br>  18 weeks boy <br>  This is what i wanted tho but believe me you will be great with this !<br>  i am sothrilleed we are having a boy My hubby said there is nothing like a boy and his mom . he will always be your pal and you will have a man to help you out even when he is grown|`|CJqK40uFaa	you arent a bad mother. you are just adjusting to the change. i thought i was having a girl, and when i found out he was a boy, i was pretty bummed for a while, but once i started going shopping i got excited again. it was hard looking at lil dresses and stuff but they say that baby boys are great and a boys first love is his mom so think of what you are shaping in your sons life. he will have u to look up to and base whoever he finds to love and marry after you. thats a big thing to be in control of. just think. you wont have to deal with periods and pms and all that drama lol, it should be easier with a boy. at least thats what i tell myself. dont feel bad though. the love will come, if not soon as SOON as you see your lil sons face. it just takes some adjusting and its hormones. if u need anymore cheering up u can message me :) congrats|`|uuHPneEcaa	u should just be happy with what u got, there are so many people out there that want children and can't have them. (not trying to be mean or harsh or anything okay)<br>  <br>  I understand the feeling I wanted a girl so bad I had tons of dreams and it was a girl in every dream I had. but when I was 19 weeks, the ultra sound tech asked me what I was hoping for, I said a girl.. she said if its a boy can I keep it I told her no.. she said well hun ur having a boy, I began to cry!! I didn't matter to me anymore what I was having as long as I was having a healthy baby sex didn't matter to me anymore. I have a name picked out (Alexander James), He doesn't have a room yet because my apartment isn't ready but If it was it will be all nice a decorared in blue. I didn't start buying baby clothes until I knew the sex of the baby. <br>  <br>  U should just be happy that ur having a healthy baby =). and no ur not a bad mother so get that out of ur head right now! U are going to be the best mother u can possilby be to ur lil baby boy! NO MATTER WHAT
Kl1h5dCaaa	My 2 middle Boys saw a Speech Therapist since 1yo. Our William is hearing impaired so we had to see to learn sign language.<br>  <br>  Tobias picked up talking at about 2 years of age. He is 3.5yo now and honestly he doesn't shut up. William on the other hand, doesn't talk at all, well he does at home, but around people, no way.<br>  <br>  I know about the knots in the stomach too. Truth is there isn't much we can do, but we can try and get the help needed for them. Easier said than done, the guilt of a mothers mind is fierce.<br>  <br>  With Tobias he started talking about 20 months. It was trying to make him see that he could talk, and he could, just wouldn't. Stop the older sibling talking for him. We've actually had to stop everyone talking for William, to try and coax him out.<br>  If at 18 months he can say 20 words he is well ahead of our Sons. William & Tobias didn't say a word, only babble until they were almost 2, Dominik our Eldest was 4yo. Our youngest 2 blew everyone away with almost a good understandable vocabulary at 12months.<br>  <br>  I think it is worth it, but only if you get a good Speech Therapist. Our first one, wasn't any good, but our second Therapist, is excellent. <br>  <br>  Good Luck with it all|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Hey, stop worrying.  My son had a cleft lip when born and lisps as his teeth are wonky.  We went to the speech therapist and they give you exercises to do.  You just have to spend a bit of time with him on his own doing them that's all.<br>  <br>  By the way, youngest children often do really well in life because they can see all the mistakes their older siblings make and then just get on with things themselves.<br>  <br>  So don't fret - he will be fine!|`|8jlOGOAeaa	While I don't have any personal experience, my cousin has three children (ages 20, 14, and 7) and they ALL have had speech therapy. The oldest two talk completely normal now, and you wouldn't even be able to tell they used to have problems. The 7 year old is still in speech therapy twice a week (I think) but she sounds a 100% better than what she did a few years ago.<br>  <br>  The thing with speech therapy (and therapy really) when dealing with toddlers and small children is that they don't even know it's anything other than play time. Most teachers are really good, and make all the "work" fun for the kids.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	he doesn't HAVE to go.  you choose to have him go.  my 19 month old is behind too. He understands perfectly, just doesn't talk.    I refuse to put him in therapy until he is over 2.  I worked in daycare for over 5 years and there are many kids who can not talk and they are three. Some 4. They understand perfectly, just do not talk.  and let me remind you that Einstein didn't talk till he was 4. I am pretty sure that he didn't go to therapy either. You are making a big deal out of nothing.  If he is on target, why fix something that is not broke?|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Oh he is in good shape!  Mild mild delay.  My 3 sons have all gone through early intervention for speech delays and other delays too.  I have seen kids come in with mild delays like you describe and catch right up in only a few months, real quick. <br>  <br>  Not the case for my kids who have more severe delays but it all comes out in the wash, my 8 year old talks constantly and didn't really talk till 6, he had no words at 2 and 3 and 4<br>  <br>  Einstein was high functioning autistic, your child is clearly not.<br>  <br>  Waiting is the worst advice anybody could give you.<br>  <br>  I have been involved with early intervention for 6 years.  I have met hundreds of parents with delayed kids, not once have I ever heard a parent say this therapy is crap and a waste of time, I have heard numerous times if we had only done this sooner.|`|AA12380746	For some reason I don't get emails and people don't get what I email... so I guess ask the question and I will be all over answering it.
BTuFtui3aa	That would only apply if the person was finalizing in India.<br>  <br>  According to the US State Department: "Indian law only allows Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists to complete full adoptions of Indian children. However, Under the Guardian and Wards Act of 1890, foreigners may petition an Indian District Court (or Family Court in larger urban areas) for legal custody (guardianship) of a child for the purpose of taking the child abroad to conclude a full and final adoption."<br>  <br>  If the adoption is finalized abroad-- which it would by definition be in international adoption-- there is no religion requirement imposed by India. The adoptions are legal if the above steps were followed.<br>  <br>  The website you quote is not incorrect exactly, but isn't giving you the full story.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	India is one of the most diverse country's when it comes to religion. I believe that just as in the US Adoption Agencies have the right to set their own rules. In the US some adoption agencies will require a certain religious affiliation in order to work with an interested adoptive family. Those whom do not qualify to work with that agency would need to find one that worked with families who were not.<br>  <br>  This is very common in the US and other countries such as India where there is freedom of religion. So this agency in India is only service these religious affiliations. Much the same as in the US working with a Catholic agency may require the families they work with to be Catholic or at least Christian. <br>  <br>  Hopefully this will not be changed as I feel that a Hindu parent should have the comfort knowing their child will not be adopted by people of a different faith if this matters to the biological parents they should at least have that much say so. <br>  <br>  Even our children adopted from Foster Care and placed after their mother's rights were terminated were placed with a family that met the request of their mother who made religion one of the things that mattered to her.|`|tX2giFynaa	Read the following links carefully.<br>  <a href="http://www.karmayog.org/adoption/adoption_16981.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.karmayog.org/adoption/adoptio...</a>|`|2wyDALHgaa	That is somewhat correct.  It applies to foreign adoptions.  As a Canadian, and as a Christian, when I was living in India we could only get permanent guardianship of our daughter under an Indian court order.  We could not adopt her formally there even though we were living in the country because we were not Indian citizens.  The same goes for people who are not living in the country at the time they are trying to adopt (those based in Canada, the US or other countries).  They can only get legal guardianship under the Indian courts and must finalize the adoption in their home country.  The guardianship order actually reads to the effect that they are appointed the permanent guardians for the purpose of removing the child from India to their home country for the purposes of adoption.  <br>  <br>  Now, if you are Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Muslim, Buddhist or any other religion that allows for formal and legal adoptions as recognized under Indian law then you may do one of those legal "religious adoptions" rather then obtain guardianship through the courts and, I believe, they are recognized by most countries.  You may still need to "re-adopt" in accordance with your countries laws when you return though.  <br>  <br>  When I, or others, speak of our adoptions from India we are just simplifying it for the sake of discussion.  We actually obtained guardianship of our children under Indian law and then completed the adoptions back home.  <br>  <br>  Hope that makes it a bit more clear for you.
hJWjSWYXaa	Stress is the number one cause of missed period's but it could also be your body adjusting it's self, if you hang out with girls a lot your periods are trying to readjust to each others days and soon you'll all be on it at the same time! If you been hanging out with boys a lot your period is being thrown off wake due to your hormones changing! Don't worry it will go back to normal!|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	That happens sometimes, I am sure it will show up sooner or later.  If it is consistently irregular then get it checked out, if it is only once don't worry.|`|AAZ3sNCgaa	Stress can play a big factor in making your period come later than usual.  Also, a lack of key nutrients can cause you to have irregular periods, which is commonly seen in females with eating disorders.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	stress and change in your diet.  If you dont eat, then your body thinks it is not able to support having a baby, so you won't ovulate.  Same with stress|`|kP3Ryfyuaa	sometimes stress, or you could just be irregular. I heard your body changes every 7 years so maybe you are going through a "change" and sometimes when you are younger they just arent as regular!|`|GfG6wupTaa	Are you doing any drugs?? Legal or illegal????
AA10624857	It varies depending on the environment and the condition of the sperm. Typically, though, sperm should easily be able to live inside a woman for 2-3 days. In optimal conditions, though, sperm may be able to live as long as 6-7 days. It's hard to pinpoint exactly the moment of ovulation and after the egg leaves the ovary, there is only about 12-24 hours where the egg will remain viable. So, having sex on the day you ovulate may or may not work out. If the egg releases in the morning and you don't have sex until evening than the window of opportunity may be past. Having sex a day or two before ovulation tends to work better since the sperm are ready and waiting when the egg comes down the fallopian tube. It's a tight timing act and even if the sperm does manage to penetrate the egg there are a variety of problems in the fertilization process that can cause the attempt to fail. Statistically, only about 20-25% of the time does a viable pregnancy result when both egg and sperm are present.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	I  read that some can stay in 3-5 days. But it all depends on the temp. and fluid.|`|f0dnVAW7aa	The maximum is usually five days, and only if you have optimal cervical mucus, which is eggwhite or watery. Sperm last longer in that fluid, which peaks shortly before ovulation. If you have recently menstruated, or are due to again soon, sperm probably won't last more than a day or two, if they make it past the hostile cervial fluid you have the rest of the month. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is more input and advice: <br>  <br>  It is a fact that sperm can live up to 4-5 days in your body, contrary to anything else you may have heard or read. In addition to this fact, the egg released can live between 12-24 hours. Therefore, your fertile period starts approximately 4-5 days PRIOR to ovulation and ends 12-24 hours after ovulation. If you do the math, it is possible for some woman to be fertile for as many as 7 days. You may have heard you can only get pregnant one or two days a month...SO NOT TRUE!!! You may only ovulate that long, but with the life of sperm and the life of the egg, your fertile time can be much longer. . <br>  <br>  Depends on when she is ovulating. If there is a lot of mucus (usually a lot more when she IS ovulating), it can last up to 5 days. If not, usually about a day or two.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	If you have very good ewcm it can last a long time. I watched a video about a pregnant woman who was in the hospital delivering and when the doctor examined her he asked how long ago she had sex as he looked at her cm with a microscope and saw live sperm. The last time they had made love was 11 days before!  You need the good mucus so they can live in it, if you are dry, they will dry up and die.
qrfJ0ffiaa	At the point of criticism I handle it well, when when I get home I am usually VERY peed off and dont handle it very well. My partners mother and sister have a habit of making me feel like im a rubbish mum. His mum babysat my daughter for 4 hours and because she didnt poo in this time she gave her water with sugar in it, she was 4 months old! His sister is the worst though, she always criticises me for the way I feed Rylie, like she doesnt have chocolate and instead of crisps she has organix range of rice cakes, she always questions us about why Rylie only drinks water and not juice, because they make juice for babies dont ya know???? Lol, arggghhh, her latest 'criticism' was "what are we all supposed to get Rylie for Easter if she isnt allowed chocolate? Its pathetic" <br>  <br>  OMG I wish I could open her eyes to the obesity rates etc in this country and then she'd realise why I dont shovel crap down my daughters throat at 14months of age!!!!<br>  <br>  And yes she does have a daughter, who drinks coca cola and tea with sugar from a avent bottle!!!|`|pXSKSS3daa	I don't.<br>  <br>  If someone wants to tell me how to raise my son they are more than welcomed to but don't expect me to sit back and take it. My husband's grandmother made comments about our son having a pacifier(he was then only 3 months old) and how it's for "lazy parents". I told her "It works for us and he's happy", and that was the end of that.<br>  <br>  I raise my son to the best of my abilities and I'll be darned if someone is going to talk badly to me about it.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	My MIL doesn't criticize me, she just strongly tells me what she used to do. I ignore her. Her and I just butt heads so if I give into her arguments we could be there for hours bickering over stupid things since neither one of us gives into the other. So I just avoid it by ignoring her or nodding and smiling.|`|wURg3jBcaa	Tell her the jumpers aren't shrinking, your son is growing.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i come on here and rant about it|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Where appropriate, I will tell my MIL what research I have done that led me to making whatever decision she is questioning. I try not to be mean, but it doesn't hurt to strongly imply that someone who last dealt with a newborn while Nixon was president might not be up to date on the latest methods.<br>  <br>  Occasionally I will just ignore her.  Sometimes if it's an issue that I don't feel strongly about (she wanted to let the baby try some potatoes at Christmas) I'll just go along and figure the baby will let us know if it's a bad idea.  And she is reasonable enough to take that as the final word.|`|OQdPzl15aa	Just take it with a grain of salt.  Remember that she has been through motherhood before, and probably feels obligated to share whatever she has learned.  Just thank her graciously, and tell her you have it under control...but if you need advice, then she is definitely at the top of your list.<br>  <br>  I don't know any mother in law who doesn't act this way =], so I wouldn't let it get to you.  You are the mommy, and you know what's best.  That's all that matters.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Just ignore it and try to be nice. Don't take everything personally. I'd just say, " I guess they don't make jumpers the way they did in your day". As for giving the baby red onion, I'm not sure I'd do that...could be a real choking hazard due to the texture. Your mil may have read how many babies actually choke to death.|`|AA12080472	i would of assured them that i am certified in dislodging objects from a choking baby.<br>  <br>  i would of told them that that the next time i need to do laundry, i will drop it off at their house. so that way its perfect.  who wants to do laundry anyways.  <br>  <br>  u got to be quick with your comebacks.<br>  <br>  sometimes it helps to listen to hteir criticism maybe they have a point. if they are not making a point, just have a funny sarcastic comeback.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	I just smile and ignore it.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	my father is the same way. my daughter can't make a move without him screaming (like a woman) and jumping to be right by her side. if HE thinks she took too big a bite of something he will make her spit it out in his hand! it makes me so mad! people will always have something to say about something! i just do my best to ignore it and when i am out of his ear shot i vent (usually to hubby or my mom).if you can't hold your tongue then do what i do and just simply say : i got her this far and she is still alive and healthy i must be doing something right! OR listen, i am with her 24 hours a day 7 days a week and i know what she likes and what she can handle and so does she just leave her be.<br>  the main thing to remember is to count to 10 before you say anything and the most important piece of advice i can give to anyone (especially mommies) is this:<br>  opinions are like a**holes everyone has one and they ALL stink!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	I know people will tell you to "ignore it" but that can only last so long before you're ready to scream at her.  My mother in law is the same way.  She questions EVERYTHING we do.  "should you be doing this?"  "Why dont you do this?"  "I don't think you should be doing that."  Or an all new one that she has added after she asks me after any of those "should you" questions is "or do you even care."  I just want to strangle her sometimes.  <br>  When she starts questioning about your baby's eating habbits just say "The doctor gave us the okay for MY son to eat it."  Emphasize on the MY son part on everything she corrects.  Whenever she questions about his clothes shrinking in the wash you can say "yeah maybe I did wash it wrong, or maybe it's those few extra inches he grew this past month."  Just answer back.  You can only ignore it for so long before it turns into a problem.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	it takes a lot of inner strength to keep from yelling your strangling them!! lol. honestly, try to ignore them. i'm not sure what kind of MIL she is though. i mean, i can tell she's obviously a "know it all" and seems controlling like her way is the only way. you'll have to play it by ear. if you think she would listen to you by confronting her and letting her know you appreciate her trying to help, but it makes you feel (blank). cuz i dont know how you feel. try to talk it out with her. maybe she has no idea she's coming off the way she is. maybe she hasn't been around a baby in a long time and so all those noises babies make, keeps her on edge. if all else fails, try to keep away from her when your at these family events...i know it'll probably be near impossible. but the best advice i can offer is to confront her about it away from everyone else so she doesn't feel attacked. good luck!!|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Actually this type of thing has happened at family functions several times. When it comes to criticism about how I raise my son I am very, very defensive because I am a damn good mom and I know it. I would never do anything to jeopardize my son and when people make comments or give unsolicited advice I get pretty annoyed(depending upon how it was said too.) I am there with my son 24/7 and I know what he is capable of and what is right for him. Same is true for you and your son.<br>  Other than with my son, I handle criticism fairly well. I usually just consider the source and/or make a smart*** comment to them. I don't usually get angry or defensive. Sometimes it can be quite humorous (my husband and I will have a good laugh later.)<br>  Your MIL needs to chill. I hope your partner is willing to back you up though. While it seems to me these stupid comments of hers would be laughable now, I can see where they could really become an issue.|`|Olo2Stqxaa	some clothes shrink in the dryer and some don't. us old ppl don't use dryers bcuz the 60's cotton and elactic shrinks. we also use cold water on new stuff cuz warm or hot will fade the color. As for criticism If she is polite you may be able to talk to her. Try to decipher if it is constructive criticism. "You teach ppl how to treat you" She thinks she can tell you stuff well then you have as much right to tell her whatever. Stick up for yourself cause nobody elce will.|`|qStmw7qgaa	Seems to me you are doing everything right!  :-)  At 11 months, babies usually feed themselves (and they are SO cute when they play the copy game.  My niece does that too!  If you cough, she will cough back)  :-)  <br>  <br>  I would ignore her, or find an appropriate way to tell her that you are the mom and you are doing exactly what is right for you and your son.  If she doesn't like it, then she should keep her opinions to herself.  You are Mommy.  And Mommy ALWAYS knows best.  That is what I think.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I am 35 and still get told what to from my mother.  I still struggle to find the strength to stand up to her but sometimes I find that if I ignore her for a period of time she realises that she should back off a little.  Yeah she does go back to her old ways from time to time but the silent treatment does work sometimes.|`|953d56217e04f770928da61b84727bd3aa	I have to ignore my mother-in-law because she says so many things, not just to do with my children, that I'd just be arguing with her all the time if I didn't.<br>  It's called meddling and interfering and I hate it.|`|YHdjNv87aa	Just ignore her or tell her you appreciate her concern but he i your son and if you want her advice you will ask her for it. Or get your partner to have a word with her. <br>  god luck|`|uTIoOa62aa	ignore it|`|EhGR05Etaa	I don't think you should ignore it....especially with family because once you start letting people think they have a say or that you don't know what you're doing...it will never stop.  No one knows what's better for your child then you, and you also have to remember that you spend more time with him then anyone else and you know what he can and can't do and what he likes and dislikes....which is what I would say if I were you.  I don't know if this applies but my husband is a little older then me which in turn his parents are older...and raising a child was VERY different back then...and a lot of things have changed....like what position to let baby sleep in.  Anyway just always remember no one knows your child more then you....and of course you will do whatever it takes to keep them safe.  But strangers wouldn't get away with telling me how to raise my child...and family wouldn't either unless they weren't "telling" me but asking (that's a little different).  Especially if you have a different idea of what you want to do then the family...think about if they ever watch him....I wouldn't want him to get the wrong idea about who is the parent....and what is right and wrong...you know?  Good Luck|`|OuuYoSBeaa	you have to ignore it. MIL are the worst for critising their daughter in laws. you just have to say thanks for the input. as far as the jumper things go, it all depends on the brand, you can wash all the clothes the same every day, but some shrink and some wash nicely and has nothing to do with your laundry skills unless you plan on hand washing everything and hang to dry... not likely.<br>  As long as you dont live with your MIL, just be glad you dont have to go for dinner everyday with her, and just ignore what she says, with a smile on your face since at the end of the day, its your baby and you raise him the way you want.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i started to ignore it. when he was first born i took it all to heart and even cried a few times but yesterday i was at my friends lil boy bday party and i mentioned that i took the baby humidifer bc i was coughing alot. they looked at me like he sleeps with a humidifier why? im like because he has been stopped up and has a cough but it was like i did something horrible. my guys mom is the worst. she even took my son away from my friend bc he was coughing when she was feeding him. he has a cold of course he is going to cough. i just laugh now|`|VXhOLgDEaa	I don't handle it. I make sure to let whoever is criticizing me know ..that his/her advice or comment is unecessary and not asked for. I went through my share of unwanted advice...because I was in my early 20s...and my MIL's friends thought that my MIL would be the one taking care of MY baby once I had my daughter ..just because I was young and probably didn't know what to do. Which was completely wrong because I'm the oldest out of 3 girls...and the youngest is 12 years younger than I am. What's even more amusing ..is my MIL sucks with babies..she doesn't know what the he** she's doing half the time...so I hate letting her babysit...she's always making stupid mistakes that should be common sense...because my husband even knows that what she's doing is weird and wrong. She only had one son (my husband)...and left him with babysitters when he turned 1mth old. SO....I don't trust her. ANYWAYS....it's always my MIL's friends that's always trying to give me stupid unwanted advice that I don't care to hear.....I just don't say anything and walk away ..or roll my eyes. Yea I'm kind of rude...but I don't care...they should learn to keep their mouth shut because it's not their baby....I hate it when my mother in law is always making stupid mistakes around my baby but always wants to babysit her....GODDDD it's annoying I just wanna tell her to go make her own baby and leave mine alone. I know it's her granddaughter...but uhm I'm the mom....give me some d*mn breathing space.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Ive been though this many times before. Ive learned to ignore it. I do have an online journal that I rant to that helps also a bunch. We brought our son over to meet my MIL friends for the first time. They kept telling us that we are dressing him wrong and that he should be on cereal already. Needless to say he was only 2 months old at the time. We told them what our doctor said and that we were going by that. Though it didn't work they kept putting in their 2 cents and it was really annoying.<br>  <br>  People just don't seem to understand that it is your child and not theirs.<br>  I have many more stories about people telling me how to raise my son but it would be pages long.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	It used to really piss me off...and to be honest sometimes it still does, but I try not to let it get the best of me. <br>  <br>  I just always try and bite my tongue and ignore it...Because regardless they are going to say what they want, and in the end, its still your baby and you will raise them the way you want them to be raised...<br>  <br>  I know its hard sometimes, especially with Inlaws...But, in order to avoid conflict (unless they say something REALLY outta the way) just nod and smile....Because Like I said...ITS YOUR BABY!!!!
KDb96QS7aa	Yes, I was sad when I had to get rid of my sleep positioner. I happened to have a very odd shaped pillow I could use (and still use) in it's place. It is basically like a very, very long boppy pillow and skinnier and very firm ( he could not suffocate in it because it is so hard). I ended up snaking that over the top of his head and down his back so he was a little more secure but if he moved the whole set up would move too.  I don't know if you could fashion something similar - something you could stick behind her or next to her that is very firm that she couldn't muzzle her face into?|`|AA12080472	once your baby can roll around its safer to keep all and any objects out of her crib.  no need for a sleep positioner|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I've read online that as soon as the baby can roll that they should take out the sleep positioner...1 due to the fact they can suffocate or like piper has done and pulled it out<br>  <br>  Basically the risk of sids is dropped when they can roll. Amber sleeps on her face and I find her in all sorts of weird positions when I wake up...even sometimes she has fallen asleep in her crib sitting up lol|`|zPYyGw8oaa	Take it away, usually sleep positioners are used only for the first month or not at all...it will be difficult but eventually she will settle and be able to sleep without it. if she still likes to be swaddled just continue that to help her feel at ease :)|`|AA10063059	take it away once they move about freely they will not suffocate,that is not what a cot death is
oCTG5IVvaa	Congratulations!!!!<br>  How exciting! i always read your questions and it's lovely to hear such brilliant news!!!<br>  There is nothing to say this is an ectopic pregnancy, I used OPKs and i only caught a positive one by chance (it was late at night) i would have missed it, and also had dud OPKs which just didn't work.<br>  STAY RELAXED and calm! don't stress!<br>  Eat well and take your vitamins/folic acid (although im sure you already are!) i use pregnecare.<br>  The doctor may test you for confirmation, mine didn't he said home test are just as good...especially as i had done more than one using different brands lol<br>  Doctor will give you a due date and send a letter to your local hospital to arrange your care with midwifes over next 8 months or so.<br>  The midwife dept will contact you by letter with your booking in appointment (around 10 weeks where i live) and will send you a screening booklet for you to read up on.<br>  <br>  So happy for you, take care mama! and keep us up to date!<br>  x x x|`|FLOjzbKEaa	Gongrats.

Pregnancy is a joyous experience so i'm glad you've finally got the opportunity to experience it. Chances of it turning into an ectopic are extremely unlikely so don't worry yourself on that score. Not every woman gets EWCM, or some do and just don't realise it, so it means nothing you didn't. Enjoy being pregnant and prepare to start the fun bit of looking at/buying baby things and deciding what colour you want to paint the nursery.. Once you get a positive pregnancy result the chances of it becoming negative are next to nil, so don't worry! I'm very happy for you.|`|XwjjKkPCaa	Hey Hunnie, <br>  <br>  OMG how did i miss this i havent been on in a few days im delighted for ya!!<br>  <br>  See now you see anything is possible last week i was reading you were annoyed and trying to give up ttc now this week your pregnant and joining me in the pregnancy section. <br>  <br>  Still waiting for the rest of you TTC's over here, Lola, TTC Fairy  have all my baby dust! Tubster sends love too xxxxxx|`|Ldvi6UPOaa	Cakies!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm so excited for you!!! Don't start to worry hun, you need to be stress free right now. Just wait until your doctor confims your pregnancy and just wait it out. I'm sure everything is fine. And by the way some women don't have EWCM show externally so you may have had it deep inside your cervix and you just didn't know.<br>  <br>  But any ways I am sooooooooo EXCITED for you!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Whooooooooo Hoooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|b3889ee355f01fc906d1159fd12fa66daa	Congratulations!!

I got my BFP a few weeks ago and now im 9 weeks pregnant! It still hasn't sunk in, im so excited but so scared at the same time that something will go wrong cause I just can't believe that this is gonna happen. In regards to some of your other questions, I was told not to eat seafood like prawns and uncooked stuff also to stay well away from uncooked meat and raw eggs. I was also told that if there are peanut allergys in your family then to stay away from peanuts but im not sure how true that one is!! Also with the weight watchers diet, my personal opinion would be to come off it and just keep to a balanced diet eat loads of fruit and drink fruit juice, make sure you get your 5 a day!! Just to pre-warn you if you are a little overweight like me, the midwife will say that you should try and loose a bit of weight and when she told me this I burst into tears and came over all emotional!! How pathetic did i look. Take care and congrats again to you both xx
LPEWAoWCaa	I'm the mom of three and I also have worked retail previously and I think you were completely right and the Grandmother was overreacting.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I think the grandmother was just a racist b**ch.. If he was clearly white and his mother was with them. She would have kept her mouth shut.<br>  <br>  I would have told her to leave and take her money elsewhere.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Near or in? <br>  <br>  I assume the definition is simple. In is for women, near is for the general public...|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i wouldn't have even noticed to tell you the truth. are you telling me that if i had a son and i needed to go into a dressing room and i told him to stand outside the door so that he didn't get lost that i would be in the wrong or my child would be doing something wrong because he is simply standing outside the dressing rooms? give me a break. it would be different if he was peeking under the curtains or if it was a creepy man and not a young child. people are STUPID as this grandmother so blatantly showed herself to be. i think you did the right thing. the lady had the option to change dressing rooms if she was THAT uncomfortable. there is NO reason for those peoples behaviors and i would have soon told her to leave if she didn't like it. what an a** those grandparents are and i tell you what all it teaches their granddaughter is to be afraid of every male because he might be a peeping tom! idiots! you did the right thing.|`|hRVB5VGzaa	i think you reacted fantasticlly! i work in a clothes store and would probably have done the same by explaining that they had as much right to be standing there as the womans husband did being in the store. good on you!|`|562qoBUUaa	I think you did the right thing, offering the other fitting room in the back.  The woman was just looking for something to complain about.|`|mPyN2XX3aa	Sounds like a crabby old lady who likes to complain to be happy.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	yea way overreacting. i hated working in retail because of people like that.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	She did overreact but let me tell you something...if she was a grandmother, what can you do? She`s getting older, her mind is just not as logical as of a young person...and she didn`t realize the whole story about why the father and the son where helping the little girl.<br>  I think you handled it well, you found out what was going on, made sure the guys were no threat and so you did your job.<br>  You can`t please everybody and whatever that lady said, she will be back hehe, she`ll buy more clothes and spend more money at your store.|`|XChiSgDZaa	OMG you were sooo right the grandmother clearly over reacted. Its not like the boy was in side the dressing room with his sister he was standing there with his father.  Good for you for not giving in to this angry grandmother. If she has the money to spend thousands of dollars then she can go some where else and spend it .|`|AA12080472	well, i would of told the grandmother he is waiting for his 7 year old daugter, whom he is trying to protect. can't expect a 7 year old to go into the dressing room on her own.<br>  <br>  sounds like she was trying to control things. <br>  <br>  i would address this problem to the top management to ask what is the appropriate way to handle a problem like this.  the child was 7 and was with her father, where should dadddy stand when she tries things on.  who leaves a 7 year old unmonitored in a store?|`|PUUXbVK2aa	i'm not a mother, but i still think that's rediculous.  <br>  <br>  i don't understand why she just wouldn't have gotten her granddaughter to the other dressing room.<br>  if i was the grandmother, i would have taken my granddaughter to the other dressing room, or another store if i felt that uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  if i was in your shoes, i probably would have told her to spend her money elsewear or i would have taken her granddaughter to the other dressing rooms myself.
ge2IamhUaa	What wouldn't go with such a simple name?  They should consider the masculine names on each side of the family for the middle name.|`|omegLbOAaa	Lane Perry|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Lane Matthew<br>  Lane Christopher<br>  Lane Alexander|`|qeVrEYjvaa	Lane Anthony<br>  Lane Reece<br>  Lane Thomas<br>  Lane Wade|`|VEkkn2Otaa	Michael<br>  Eli<br>  Elijah<br>  Maddox|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	Michelle<br>  BreeAnne<br>  Hill|`|flWS1h7vaa	I like the name Lane...For a girl I think that Lane Nicole,and Lane Alizabeth is prettty also like Harley Lane and call her Lane.. For  a boy Lane Micheal,and Lane Briar, is cute also like the name Johnathan Lane and call him Lane.
fMilDRgLaa	I had implantation bleeding with both of my pregnancies.  I had from light pink, to dark brown, to bright red.  It was never heavy and lasted 2...maybe 3 days at most.  <br>  <br>  It depends when your last period was and when you ovulated. BUT....what you described was me in both my pregnancies.|`|oMNXWMs9aa	I had implantation bleeding with this pregnancy. It was not enough bleeding for a liner or a tampon. Just when I would go pee I would wipe and it would be there so I thought I was going to start my period but never did this happened for about 4 days then on the 5th day I too 4 test and they all said positive I am now 4mths. The blood was brown then red everyone is different. I tested before the bleeding started and got a negative so I really thought it was my period then I tested again after that happened and it was positive. I would just wait a while if it continues for a few days like that then there is a good chance that you are pregnant.|`|CkoWcA4gaa	I had found out last week Tuesday that I was pregnant. On Friday I had noticed some mucus with red spots and then my next wipe was a pinkish colour then I had no other bleeding... I went to the OBS/GYN and he checked things out and narrowed it down to implantation bleeding... <br>  My suggestion would be to take a test and see if you are pregnant and go from there....<br>  Good Luck!|`|ZKkZWiM9aa	sounds more like the start of your period,or if you have been having a lot of baby making lately you could cause a slight bleed.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That sounds like your period coming, when I have had implantation bleeding it's been pink and that's it - only a little color.|`|miPubuDYaa	It could be. Implantation bleeding only occures in 2 or 3 women out of 10. It would take place 7 - 10 after conception. I would just wait until you period is due and take a pregnancy test.. So if your next period is due in about week. That would be a even bigger Yes, it could be inplantation bleeding.<br>  <br>  BTW don't be sticking your finger on your cervix, if you are pregnat that could cause a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  add when your last period was and we could better tell you.
ksXayEUoaa	I didn't pick up on it until I finished reading your question.<br>  <br>  I never knew kids growing up that spent their time making fun of people's names. I give people more credit than that. Moreover, the bullies I have come across don't typically care to ask a person about their middle name.<br>  <br>  If his initials were KKK that'd be a different story.|`|86oPkfzOaa	Yes, I would pick a different name.|`|1h5RpINNaa	Kids are mean so more than likely yes he will be made fun off.  If she really likes the name maybe she could just switch it to Zander Adrian instead, otherwise poor baby.|`|ecNeN0staa	How about Adrian Sanders Saya?  XD|`|BO28Mn8haa	when is he honestly going to use the initials like that? usually he'd use A.Z. no big deal|`|Mb2xXZZqaa	perhaps, yes. i would chose another middle name.|`|0QXiPW9eaa	Possibly... <br>  I wouldn't like them to be my initials.|`|A2G9foewaa	Umm yeah i can see a lot of counseling in his future|`|HuSlCMC6aa	Yes he will! My initials are ACS...but without the 'C' its A.S. and believe it or not I get jokes because of it!|`|ElayGlHPaa	Maybe she should have the middle name be Xander or Sander. probably Xander though|`|OCFh5CBlaa	yeah..i could see it already..lol<br>  <br>  "yo azz face! wats up?"

sgMno1PRaa	if your parents are in the room then they will just say it.|`|vue9NOhYaa	The doctor will not tell your parents unless you give permission. <br>  <br>  And yes, the doctor will probably ask you if you want them in the room or not, and you are free to ask them to leave. <br>  <br>  (I have a 17 year old daughter, and the doctor always asks her if she wants me in the room or not.)<br>  <br>  EDIT: You are a minor, but reproductive health matters are treated differently, and they will not tell your parents without your consent.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	If they are in the doc's room with you, then the doctor will assume it's ok to tell them too. <br>  <br>  I would ask your mum / dad if they wouldn't mind staying in the waiting room whilst you have the appt. <br>  <br>  You could always take a home test first.... they're about ￡10 from the pharmacy.  Have you had unprotected sex / missed a period?|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	In UK no he should not. Wait a minute, your parents are going to be angry, disappointed and hurt and you will have to accept that but they are also the best support you will have so the best time for them to know is now and you are going to have to make some very grown up decisions as to how you intend to deal with your child who is their grandchild|`|xpstigPTaa	Well because your a minor, they will most likely tell your parents. Why not take one at home before you go? You need to start being more careful...you shouldn't even be sexually active yet. Good luck.|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	its up to you if you want them in the room or not when you get your results if you dont want them there just say and if they dont go the dr can make them but unless you say they wont know|`|ESKslyfsaa	Why can't you go on your own, I wouldn't dream of going to doctors with my 16 yr old son, unless he asked me.|`|zcujH5XDaa	ok if you are going to a ob/gyn then you can ask them not to speak to your parents abuout any medical situation unless you giver permission, but if you are going to a pediatrician they will most likely say something......also try telling your parents you are uncomfortable having them in the room when the doctor is checkin your private parts, and tell the doctor that 2 they wont let them in if you dont want|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Well the doctor will tell you whether your parent is in the room or not. If you don't want your parents to know you can tell the DR before hand that you would like to tell them yourself if you are. But it's kinda hard to hid if they are taking you. You will grow if you are.I guess I don't know what your plan is but this is my answer.|`|gdnL63ngaa	Tell your parent to wait in the lobby. Just tell them you are getting a physical or something. You are old enough to see the doctor alone!<br>  <br>  Its totally up to you but the doctor should not tell your parents, You're not 12 or 13, you're 17 and perfectly capable of finding out information on your own.|`|qmNZnmzeaa	i think since your a minor the doctor will tell them. have you done a home prego test yet? maybe itd be a good idea and find out and beat the doctor telling them. i got pregnant at 15 and i told my parents before the doctor could that way itd still be a shock but not as bad if they heard it from anyone but me. good luck|`|oWAUb6vpaa	You're underage so the doc is supposed to tell them. <br>  <br>  (Condoms, condoms, condoms... you need birth control ASAP. I would discuss this with doc tmrw if you're not pregnant and if you're not comfortable with your doctor, go to a woman's clinic asap.) <br>  <br>  Good luck, luv..|`|AEyztU2laa	Where are you?  Different areas have different laws.|`|4KF2cZWkaa	THEY WILL TELL YOUR PARENTS, YOU'RE BUSTED LITTLE GIRL, I GUESS YOU SHOULDA SAID NO!!!!!|`|0l1IzIQEaa	In Britain they dont have to if you are 16 as that is the legal age for consensual sex.<br>  But dont you think it will give it away if the Dr or you ask them to "step out of the room"<br>  If you are pregnat sweety then you really dont want to go through it on your own ive seen enough young girls try it and never works.<br>  Mainly because first of all the big lump you will have in your tummy is a bit of a give away, ha ha ! and mums will know straight away if their daughters sre pregnant purely by maternal instinct.<br>  Also  how would you,  A. find the money for an abotion <br>  or B. Raise it on your own without them knowing.<br>  Good Luck,<br>  Baz x|`|ZKkZWiM9aa	if your parents with you the doctor will asume its ok to talk in front of them,if you dont want this then tell the doctor,however it may be for the best as if you are pregnant at least it will come out in a nuetral enviroment where it can be discussed ,your mum hopefully ,will be a good support for you in whatever you decide to do.|`|fBhXFLSUaa	if there in the room with you he will tell them try and get them to wait in the waiting room and go in alone, but if you are pregnant maybe your better off having them there i had my first son at 16 and i told my mother as soon as i found out i taught she would kill me but she was really understanding and helped me through my pregnancy|`|HV5hqLIwaa	its most likely the dr would not tell your parents. But its better that your parents find out sooner than later. Because if you dont tell them they will  find out one way or the other. But it is up to you.<br>  <br>  Most people lose their virginity at 16 or 17. I lost mine at 13.<br>  (im a boy)|`|6Sr3mGGwaa	Im not certain but i think that the doctor will ask your parents to step out the room if it comes back positive, if your really worried ask them not to come in with you|`|UDEBAveDaa	probally whatever you want to happen the doctor will respect it as its your choice and doctors tend to be suppoortive

jMJD50Nuaa	I would take a test if I were you!  The pill doesn't usually kick in for 4 weeks.  See your GP. Good Luck!|`|ruczpWrGaa	I had most of those issues the first time i got on the pill.  cried at the drop of a hat,  sore bbs, everything.    It takes a little over a month for the pill to work into your system properly.   <br>  <br>  Your dr should have advised you of how long it would take to be  effective.  But you can still get pregnant on the pill.  My mother did, twice.  You should always use a second form of contraceptive.  You should be able to test now.  Good luck.|`|dYa5AEwSaa	this could be mental, some girls wanna has a child, and they think that them are pregnants, but it is false, but maybe can be true, i would say taht is a 50% possible.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	When taking the pill you are suppose to wait 2 weeks for everything to kick in and work correctly. Therefore you very well may be pregnant! <br>  The reason I know this is because I was put on the pill after I had my first child and doctor told me wait 2 weeks for everything to get going! <br>  I got pregnant on the pill 1 1/2 years later. So after second child I got the IUD , most effective birth control! <br>  I would say take a HTP after you miss your feb. period cause im sure you will. you sound pregnant to me , and just in case stop taking the pills , cause that can cause problems if you are preggers. If you must have sex  before you find out , wear protection just in case you are not pregnant but by the sounds of it you are.|`|W4MJiYYfaa	The key right there is the cramping, but no period.<br>  <br>  Right before I found out I was pregnant I had that, I was positive I was going to start my period but then it never came.<br>  <br>  Same thing happened to my sister in law.<br>  <br>  I'd say to test just in case. It's entirely possible to have your period while pregnant.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	I disagree (with the above post)  it is not probable to have a period for 6 days and be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  I would think it is just from your body getting used to the hormones. There are a lot of side effects from the pill.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	On the package of birth control it says it takes a month to work, so not to have unprotected sex.  <br>  <br>  Anyways- your hormones are probably changing from the birth control, but take a test anyways.
oXzHvsBpaa	No I would not. I would wait till about a year or I would ask my doctor if my baby was ready for tea. It has so much caffeine in it and it can;t be good for the baby at all.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Tea? No way.<br>  <br>  Your 5 month old only needs formula or breast milk(whichever he/she is taking).|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Tea is really hard on the stomach.  I like tea, but it occasionally disagrees with me.  Even ignoring the fact that it's full of caffeine, this just sounds like a bad idea.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	NO.<br>  the only thing a 5 month old needs is formula or breast milk (whichever you are using)<br>  unless you are giving him/her solids (baby food)<br>  <br>  i wouldn't recommend anything like tea or drinks with caffeine until at least the age of one. you should talk to the pediatrician first|`|M5HyStReaa	No. i would recommend at the same age you would think about giving coca cola as they are both caffeinated drinks.<br>  <br>  Tea also has tannins in which prevent iron absorption|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Good god, no.  Anything with caffeine in it is not recommended for babies.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Babies and children do not need caffeine.  I would never recommend giving a baby tea.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i dont remember how old my daughter was, 6 months or something, but she was sick and at that age you cant give medacine, so i bought some green tea for her, and gave it to her in a bottle, it was weak but i think she took like 2 sips and that was the end of that. <br>  i think to give it just for fun, i would wait untill after a year when they are on 3 solid meals plus snacks and off formula.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I don't even drink anything with caffine while pregnant or breast feeding, so I deifinitely would not be giving my baby tea.  At five months, he doesn't need anything other than breast milk (or formula if you aren't breast feeding).|`|gvdoMC1baa	Absolutely not.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	No, I would not. I would hold off of tea for a while. <br>  <br>  My Daughter is 15.5 months and she occasionally gets a sip of my Tea when I drink it.
WpGROxH8aa	Its possible to get pregnant when they guy doesn't ejaculate inside you. But its less likely, of coarse. So if he only was inside you a little bit, that's even less likely. So its probably unlikely, but still possible.|`|9fb8dd613b6d7669a254e54dfa56167baa	Why are you letting him put his penis anywhere near you down there without protection?  Pregnancy is highly unlikely but possible....as is herpes, genital warts, crabs,clamydia, HIV.... do you need me to go on?|`|GfG6wupTaa	Of course it could happen! But what I don't understand how it could have accidentally slipped in a " couple " of times? Why wouldn't you stop after the first time?|`|gdnL63ngaa	OMG yes! you better get a test!|`|05OjWUyCaa	You could be, but probably not. I'd take a test whenever possible if your worried about it.|`|QSodlfMraa	yes because, sperms do swim upwards, and when the penis come touch with the vagina there is a chance of pregnancy.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	you could be yes

n86nMfbtaa	I live in Texas and Medicaid for me took about two weeks. And after choosing a plan, it will take another two to three weeks for your insurance card to come in (I just got mine a week ago as Medicaid is my secondary). <br>  <br>  Until you can see a doctor, just eat healthy, take care of yourself, take your prenatals and write down any unusual things you experience so you can ask them about it when you finally see them.|`|sMvWJDqsaa	I am in the same boat...18, almost 19 weeks...started medicaid process in Colorado but moved back to Texas and had to start over..my friend who had medicaid said they told her she would get a response by phone or mail, and that they had up to 14 days to give her an answer..I think she had to wait a week to get approved, but they give you the disclaimer of 14 days so that they can take their time and you don't go postal with phone calls about your app..she also said it is a very frustrating process, but it was worth it in the end...since they base your eligibility on income..if you are like me and do not make much you should be approved..but the waiting game is maddening!!!<br>  Good luck...feel free to e-mail me with additional questions or to celebrate when you get your answer!! :)|`|uBXtBirUaa	i live in phoenix, so it might be a major difference, but I had to wait almost 3 1/2 months to hear back the first time and i got denied!

They USUALLY have pregnancy's on high priority.|`|d8f33a786fc596d3152ea4e9b00a36c6aa	I would say you will get a letter soon giving you an appointment where you'll go into the office and prove eligibility.  You'll have to take your check stubs and proof of residency and other minor stuff.  Don't worry about your visit to the doctor.  If you are approved for medicaid, they will go back and pay anything 3 months prior to your approved date.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Do you mean you applied for medicaid?  Call your caseworker if you're concerned about the time its taking for a response.|`|iu4SOin3aa	You can call 2-1-1 from a home phone (wont work with a cell) and talk to people regarding your medicaid.<br>  It can take up to 30 days to getyour application processed, but its usually quicker for pregnancy medicaid.<br>  Pregnancy medicaid is a lot different than traditional medicaid, you dont have to choose a doctor or whatever, but they will require proof of pregnancy from your gyno/obg. It shouldnt take much longer, but unless you apply for emergency medicaid, it will take longer than a week.

They also may progressively worsen or progressively become better (convalescence). Conditions may also be classified as symptomatic (present and demonstrating symptoms) or asymptomatic (present but without symptoms). Asymptomatic conditions exist for years undiagnosed and may only be found upon medical testing (such as high blood pressure).<br>  <br>  Constitutional or general symptoms are those that are related to the systemic effects of a disease (e.g., fever, malaise, anorexia, weight loss). They affect the entire body rather than a specific organ or location.<br>  <br>  The terms "chief complaint", "presenting symptom", or "presenting complaint" are used to describe the initial concern which brings a patient to a doctor. The symptom that ultimately leads to a diagnosis is called a "cardinal symptom".|`|MMj7YcXkaa	no, just because you don't feel pregnant, you are not!

KvE6eKWxaa	since a mother can go to the hospital, have the baby register the child and in the process name the child all without the father knowing, I don't think the father can do anything about it-even in Utah.|`|xq8Kn7Phaa	as long as no parental rights have been taken from the mother <br>  she kinda has the last say although if u are a participating father roll u should have a say so|`|MlshtGVTaa	well it takes two to make the child it should take a combined effort for the two to name that child. If that is imposable for whatever reason the mother is the only one that can make discussions for the child, unless the couple is married. <br>  that is federal law, now i'm not sure if Utah rubber stamped and amended this law but that is the standard.
Fkl6gV8Qaa	They won't even try until 12 weeks. That's when you are usually guaranteed to hear it and even though it is possible to hear a heart beat before then some pregnant women start to worry if they don't hear it so they just (almost always) wait for the 12th week. That said, my midwife has an ultrasound machine in her office and LOVES to look at the baby so you might get lucky.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Most likely not,I got a transvaginal ultrasound at 6 1/2,and I heard it. I heard it with a doppler at ten weeks.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	nope you wont, a heartbeat can only be heard by a doppler from the 10th week of pregnancy, if you want one of these so you can listen your self in 4 weeks, then go to www.hi-baby.co.uk they are ￡10 a month|`|dDVAUA9saa	No.  You can't hear the baby's heart beat with the doppler until around 12 weeks.|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	no i heard my twins heart beats at 14wks but it was still very difficult to find them|`|sstNdyYVaa	nope sorry its too early<br>  <br>  ull have to wait 17 weeks im afraid|`|z0XRuVwSaa	sorry no at 16 weeks u will tho|`|DRf4N4sTaa	hiya, and congrats on ur pregnancy !!! <br>  if its just an appointment with ur MW then no she wont be able to listern to HB, most MW wont try till 16wk !! mine tried at 15wk5d but said dont panic if she ***** find it, however she did, if u had a scan at 6wk tho,seeing the HB is likley, but then some havent and gone bk a wk later and all is fine :)<br>  when u get to 12wk u can get a home doppler, i got angelsounds, but ***** still find HB at 15wk so at 16wk i got a hibebe one, a little expensive but we found HB straight away and have done ever since , goodluck with ur pregnancy x|`|MKnpH4XKaa	Got a vaginal ultrasound done and I heard my baby's heart beat I was 7 weeks and 2 days it was a wonderful feeling to hear it and I got three pictures of the little baby looks like a pee-nut and I also got a DVD made so all ur friends and family see the little baby and heart beat.|`|oCTG5IVvaa	No i don't think so hun, my appointment at 11 weeks found heartbeat and she said it was lucky to be able to hear it so early.<br>  I had an emergancy scan at 7 weeks and we saw the babys heartbeat though..<br>  Good Luck|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Yes if you ask for it.  Several people said no but we were able to see it at 5 1/2 weeks. You can see it beat but maybe not hear it.|`|86PuYgDJaa	No. I first heard my baby's heartbeat when I was 14 weeks and even then the midwife said not to worry if we couldn't hear it because it depends on how baby is laid etc.|`|M5HyStReaa	no. generally they will check at 12 week ultrasound scan and via doppler from 20 week appointment.|`|AA12279950	No.|`|fZGBjtpVaa	Afraid not.<br>  <br>  Doctors in a hospital can hear the heartbeat as early as 10 weeks in SOME cases, and that's if the mother is very slim.  Generally you'll be able to hear the heartbeat at around 16 weeks, give or take a few weeks.<br>  Until about 7 weeks of pregnancy there isn't actually a baby in your womb, it's basically just a sac, with cells in. I was at the hospital when I was 5 weeks, they tried to do a scan and all they could see was sacs, can't even see a heartbeat until about 7 weeks.<br>  <br>  Congratulations btw
uX4FDZnvaa	dont worry it is fine a pregnant womens is more prone to colds throughout her pregnancy. <br>  <br>  i had a cold with my last pregnancy i found out i was pregnant the day after i my cold started. you will be perfectly fine huni xXxXxXx|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	no baby is good , make sure you get that cold taken care of colds and stuff seem to hang on to us preggo gals . congtrats!! Oct baby for you|`|dDVAUA9saa	No.  Pregnant women are likely to come down with something in the 9 (10) months of pregnancy.  Trust me, I'm 6 months and have had morning sickness, flare-up of Crohn's disease, a severe cold/asthma attack landing me at emergency on ventolin mask, and the flu.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	No.. not to worry at all.. your cold will not harm your baby.  Just be sure not to take any unnecessary medication for it, as some medications Can harm your baby.  Ask your doctor what is safe.|`|Lj8wZiLuaa	nope! the womb protects the baby from all your sickness... just dont overdo it on any medication, and make sure you check with your dr. on whats safe to take.  but the cold itself will not hurt the baby.|`|MKnpH4XKaa	hmmm seems like I read one like this last night.<br>  <br>  some say its fine but I would just wait till you go to the doctor before taken anything people are different and pregnancy are different.|`|3EiOobEVaa	no the cold is not harmful to the baby...when I got a cold and the flu during my pregnancy the only thing that I  could take is tylenol and the doctor told me to drink as much water as possible... Good Luck!!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	no!  you can take tylenol, benedryl, and sudafed to make you feel better|`|FH2iKFcJaa	As long as your fever isnt higher than 102. there is nothing to worry about.

Ashley is a bit too overused for me, but I really like Jaylen. Adalyn Grace would have to be my favourite, Jaylen Grace sounds nice too.|`|hqA9rzE5aa	Adalyn Grace. I don't like the name Ashley its too common. I also liked Jaylen but not with the middle name you choose.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Ir0dKh3iaa	Don't use Ashley Madison (its a site to look for someone to have an affair)<br>  <br>  Other two names are both pretty!!!<br>  <br>  Ashley Grace is pretty too.|`|ge2IamhUaa	Jaylen fits with the rest.

Ashley is too common.|`|gtfgZQbMaa	You know, I really like Adalyn Grace personally. I've never heard of that name before but it sounds good to me!
nuBRcuwvaa	Haha, I think all inlaws must take the same "course."<br>  <br>  First of all, this is the first of MANY battles you will probably have.  So I would lay out the rules to caring for your child now.<br>  <br>  1. You are the mom/dad and "in general" this is how we do it.<br>  (whatever the issue)<br>  2. We appreciate that you're caring for our child and we do trust you, so if you're going to try a couple of new things that is fine, but "in general" we'd prefer that you stick to our guidelines.<br>  ***Then give some examples, jelly on toast won't kill her, ice cream, etc.***<br>  3. These are the things that we are actually 100% against though.<br>  (cupcakes, salt on meat, you pick what is the worst.)<br>  <br>  I guess I've just learned that inlaws and even my parents, are going to do things differently.  As long as they play by my rules 80% of the time, I'm ok.  And if you speak up, and do so clearly, in a loving way, right away - it is easier than waiting and building resentment.<br>  <br>  And remember, 2 cupcakes and canned corn won't kill her while you're gone.  *I'm not saying its perfect, but you will have to pick your battles.*|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	You could write a list of do's and don'ts. And half way through the week you could have a friend to visit your MIL and see how the baby is. Then they could ring you up and report back|`|GpR5MI5raa	just tell your MIL that thats not the food you want your child eating. and while grandmothers are entitled to some spoiling, it may be a little early for that.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	You have your daughter on what seems like a good and healthy diet and it seems that your in-laws have the more traditional approach to child feeding (anything that seems tasty).  Which is how most of us were raised. <br>  <br>  You have a few options:<br>  <br>  Cancel your trip and stay home with your baby<br>  Bring her with you on the trip<br>  Leave her with the in-laws and let them take care of her and stop micromanaging her food.  Bread and sugar for a weekend won't kill her.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Although I do think that your MIL should respect your feelings I also think that you need to understand that her giving your daughter sweets is something that grandparents do. That's the great thing about having grandparents, they let you do things that your parents don't and they spoil you a bit. <br>  <br>   That said, there is absolutely no reason to remove all spices from your child's food (I can understand limiting sugar intake) unless your child shows adverse reactions to certain spices. All over the world babies eat spices and sea salt. If you are eating a healthy diet then your daughter should be able to eat the softer version of what you are having, if you aren't eating a healthy diet then start now because the best way to teach your child to eat healthy is not by making them eat healthy foods but by eating them with your child.<br>  <br>  There is no reason to worry. What do you think is going to happen while you are gone? Yeah she'll probably get some sweets and some salt, but what harm is a week of occasional treats going to do? Nothing, the only thing that will change is she will know the joy of getting spoiled by her grandparents.|`|pWxhivTIaa	Very good answers already given.<br>  <br>  I just want to add one thing I didn't see: even tho grandmothers like to spoil the grandkids, remember that she is not trying to harm your child; and apparently she did some things right -- after all, she raised a son that you thought was OK.<br>  <br>  enjoy your vacation|`|YR9h8p77aa	The only way you will stop worrying is by not leaving your daughter with them.  You can tell them what you expect them to feed her while you're gone, and they will listen or they won't.  But you will probably never know.  If it's for a short period of time, I wouldn't worry about it.  You can get her back on your schedule in no time.  <br>  <br>  Every one thinks they know better than you at this point.  My sitter yelled at my husband the other day and said that our 6 month old was fussy all the time because we started him on Stage 2 foods too early.  (which led me to the decision to start looking for another sitter)  You are her parent and you know what's best.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	honestly you can give them all the do's and donts taht you can think of but while the cats away the mouse will play... (or something like that) my MIL doesn't listen to a word i say so i simply had a talk with my husband and he had a talk with his mother..... he told her you either follow our rules or don't watch the baby. PERIOD. there is no way to guarantee that your in laws will do exactly what you tell them to. if you don't feel comfortable leaving your daughter with them then don't. you wont have a good time if you are not confident in the care givers. i don't want to be a downer but it's the truth. good luck
OuuYoSBeaa	young people are just that, young. you can tell them whatever you want untill you are blue in the face but most of the time they have to learn from experience. For the millions of teens out there, how many are getting the proper education, how many are getting the proper guidance from family, school, friends etc...we may not change they outcome for everyone in the world or on here, but if we get through to just one, then that is starting a difference and helping. Its like drinking and driving, you see death everyday from it, or hear about it, but yet millions still do it everyday...how do we change it..... just keep trying right.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	When you say young i'm not sure if you are referring to teens or early 20s so i'm going to go off of teens. <br>  <br>  There isn't enough education for them. High school only teaches  abstinence. And now that fake/real baby crap. My cousin went through that week of fake/real baby thing and she thought it was easy. Of course it's easy. No buying diapers, no making bottles, no staying up all night because of teething, no skipping going to friends because parents will watch the fake/real baby, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Teens thinks its easy because everything they have just magically appears. They pay for nothing.  Lights? Stay on by themselves. Hot water? Just comes through the faucet.  Heck most teens i know don't even have to pay for their own cellphones so why shouldn't they think everything else will be just as easy.|`|ODosyM8zaa	It seems like within the last 3-5 years, the idea of being pregnant and having a child, has become more of an accessory rather then a living, breathing human. These days girls think that having a baby will show that they can be responsible and unselfish. WRONG! I work at a center for teens where 25 out of our 65 teenage girls between the ages of 13 and 19 are pregnant! It amazes me to hear some of the things these girls say. Recently I've heard "My mom is really going to be the one to watch my baby. I'll just help out as much as I can." And "My baby doesn't need a dad anyways! I grew up without a dad, look at me!" I mean, these girls act like they just a new puppy to share with the family! It's crazy and I hope this epidemic comes to a halt ASAP!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	it's a little tricky for a parent to convey that to a child without sounding like we find our own child burdensome, which is not what i'd want to convey.<br>  <br>  but yes, i think with kids entering puberty it's important to try to give kids a realistic view of what parenting entails so that they understand why it's important to wait.  i think that's the idea behind those sex-ed classes where the kid has to carry a model baby around.  of course it's not the same as a real baby, but kids do learn that it's not all cuddles and coos.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i don't think you are ever fully prepared for children.  you can think you are, even the best of us thought we were, until we brought that baby home.<br>  i think some young people only see the cute aspect of a baby.  they see the sweet little baby cooing and smiling.  they don't see the screaming newborn, the projectile poop, and the weeks on end with very little sleep.<br>  <br>  i do think some people, not just young ones, are completely misinformed on kids.  i do find a little humor in people who think they "deserve" something just cuz they had a baby.  i'm really not that fond of the sense of entitlement that some parents have, expecting things that don't need just because they brought a child into this world.
hFVPEkWjaa	let your parents take you to your doctor right now don't wait any longer|`|QSodlfMraa	tell your parents so they can take you to the hospital|`|Z1FdawAOaa	tell you parents then try calling the nurse hotline, they will give you accurate information.|`|4HvuxHPoaa	call mom, dad, grandparent, older sibling, good friend.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	You need to go to the hospital.|`|vjoyv5J6aa	call 911, it could be nothing but better safe than sorry.
miPubuDYaa	Everey book is different however here is just a one: You have just started the third trimester at week 28<br>  <br>  1st trimester 1 -13 weeks<br>  2nd trimester 14 - 27<br>  3rd Trimester 28 - 40+ weeks<br>  <br>  Each trimester is about 13 weeks<br>  <br>  BTW: Don't worry if you are measuring big now. It means that your son just weights a few ounzes more than average 28week fetus. And anything can set this off. The sono tech measure him just a hair bigger, he moved durning the measurement, or he's not gonna the be average 7.5lb baby instead right now he is heading to be 7lb 11oz. If it was any concern, you doctor would have been alarmed.|`|dDVAUA9saa	0-13 First trimester<br>  14-27  Second trimester<br>  28 - 40  Third trimester|`|vjoyv5J6aa	They say your uterus is the size of how many weeks you are. 33 weeks is 33 inches.

0070ba6b4d411e4f950988e769591459aa	Why did babysitter leave the kids alone with him? I don't like men hanging around babysitting places. This is just from observation but growing up if the guy hung around a lot he was normally a molester. Most guys didn't want to be any where near the kids. Hi, bye and run out the door. <br>   Lady down the road babysitted all the neighbors kids and husband hung around with kids. I was not even a loud to go near that part of the road. Found out he molested all those kids. My mom was right!|`|lY2XI8kUaa	this is why i am a stay at home mom.  you can never be sure how safe your kids are when you leave them with strangers. there are way too many stories of children dying at the hands of child care providers or even getting hurt. i am not saying that all daycares or home daycares are bad, but it only takes a few bad people to mess it up.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	i think you need to do a background check, reference check...anywhere your kids will be spending a lot of time.  if you can find a place with great people, i say why not.  unfortunately, these people that run in home day cares are usually low income families without any training.  i live in pa and there was a story about a year back.  the babysitter left and left a 4 yr old in charge of a new born.  i am not sure if she fell or was dropped.  in any case, the baby died.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I think that everything in life has risks, and there is no way to protect ourselves, or our children, from every danger.<br>  <br>  Home daycares have risks. So do daycare centers. And so do our own homes.  You do your research and do the best you can.
BHkaULukaa	It is absolutely horrible that these kinds of things can happen to children.  I have a friend who inspects daycares and the stories she has told are enough to make me never send my child to a home daycare.  She had one woman put the children in playpens and then leave the house to go to the store down the street.  I worked in a daycare facility for many years and would never send my child to one.  The staff have more accountability at a facility, but there is so much influence from other children who are allowed to watch and say anything at home.  I don't want my child to lose his innocence at a young age.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	It goes both ways its not just in home day cares I can tell you allot of really bad stories of normal and state run day cares. Did you hear about the one last year that the director who was a male sexually molested a 10 month old baby girl and the whole daycare covered it up. The teacher knew that he was taking the little girl home and he cut her open and molested her almost all day and then sent her home like nothing had happened. Then they made up claims of her being there all day and that other teachers were there besides that one and the director. It is horrible what people do to little children. Who are we supposed to trust our kids with these days? The people at that daycare were finally prosecuted some of the people that worked at the daycare decided to tell the truth and not keep their mouths shut any more.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	i agree they are cheaper but not safer. unless you know the person youre trusting  your child with i would say h*** no. my sister in law had her daughter staying with an older woman several times a week for months before she heard from the friend that recommended the woman that the caregiver had been arrested for hitting a child with a board. needless to say neither woman leaves her child anywhere but daycare now.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	That could happen in a big huge daycare!  You have to be very alert and watch for any sign of abuse.  You should check in unannounced all the time, throughout the day. You need to investigate and NEVER be afraid to ask why.  Why is that child crying?  Why do you always have the tv on all the time? Why are there people here that do not live here and don't have children?  I personally used a inhome daycare and I loved it.  She taught my son so many things. and he was so attached to her. He would ask to go to her house on the weekends and stuff.|`|0QYIbn1saa	We have a wonderful in-home daycare provider.  I trust her 100% with my child and have never had any problems.  You have to do your research, as with ANYONE who is taking care of your child(ren).  In-home daycares shouldn't be singled out.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	if you are going to use an in-home daycare then you need to have prove that they are regulated and approved through your state.|`|JOVWBOOCaa	I think that anywhere you go these days you run the risk of something happening to your children and it is scary and sad. I have used a daycare center (a well known learning center) however currently have family watch my 4 year old. Either my aunt or my mother. They both worship my daughter and would NEVER let anything happen to her. My aunt is also a retired police officer. My daughter has known her ABC's, how to spell her name, can count and spell simple words before she was 3. She started reading in small bits, spelling her name and can write the alphabet at 3 years of age. She gets the one on one she needs as well as play dates with other kids everyday. I know that not everyone can be as lucky and that sometimes the only option is some sort of daycare center in which I would say it is the parent obligation to research as best they can from internet, to visiting the school several times, looking up state accreditation, to talking with parents who have had their kids in daycare. If choosing a small in home daycare, which personally I would not......You still need to do the same thing. The homes that some of these daycares have been run out of anyhow I would let my daughter go play ther much less be there for 5 or 6 hours, eating and playing and what not. I have seen pictures of some of the homes that these crimes happen in and I don't even know how the state can allow them to be a daycare. It is always important and not fool proof to get on familywatchdog.us and check out any area and or people your children are around, you NEVER know who could be a sexual offender. Also, as for the daycare drug kids and making them perform sex acts, it was a family run daycare....nothing like a large accredited daycare/learning center. (it was a building that had a daycare running out of it but also a swingers club). It was in Mineola Texas. More or less an in home daycare except they found a building to rent. It does not sound like you are generalizing and of course everyone is different and has to do their own research and find what is best for their own kids. However, these days a lot of time there is a reason something is so cheap, I would rather pay the extra money to feel more comfortable.....this is my child we are talking about!|`|krQiDGCHaa	Well now let's be fair, here.<br>  <br>  I remember reading something a few months ago about a day care FACILITY, a LARGE CENTER, that had children in it that were being drugged and made to perform sexual acts on each other.<br>  <br>  This stuff happens everywhere, even in big licensed facilities.<br>  <br>  If you had a bad experience with an in home daycare, I apologize for that.  However, don't go saying they are all unsafe or that the children are not properly cared for.<br>  <br>  I, myself, happen to operate an in home day care.  (I have no kids today because 2 are on vacation and 1 is sick.)  I have AMAZING references, a very low turnover rate, and very happy parents.<br>  <br>  Don't generalize.  It's rude and it makes you look unintelligent.<br>  <br>  ADD ON: To the lady whos child's femur was broken at an in home daycare -- my little brother's arm was broken at SCHOOL in 2nd grade.  This stuff can happen no matter how many people are watching your kids.  Kids fall, kids get hurt.  It can happen if they are unsupervised, or if they have 12 people watching them.  Geez.  I'm glad I don't watch your child.<br>  <br>  Also, I used to work at a large day care facility, but I quit because I didn't like how they treated the kids.  They'd put 3 year olds in time out for 2 hours.  Also, they'd make the 2 year olds walk outside in the snow barefoot if they removed their shoes.  I quit, and called CPS.  These things happen everywhere.<br>  <br>  ADD: I actually don't think that's the same story.  The one I'm referring to the children performed sexual acts on each other.  They were forced to take vicoden.  The place WAS an old church, but it was a day care facility.<br>  <br>  Also, sorry if I insulted you, it just annoys me when people generalize like that.  Bad things happen everywhere, and you shouldn't be starting a debate on how unsafe in home day cares are, when it's really ALL day cares are a risk and you just need to make sure to choose wisely.  I just didn't appreciate the way you were saying in-home day cares were no good.<br>  <br>  To Do Your Own Thinking:  Sometimes crying it out is necessary.  Hence why the many children I've raised have grown up to be successful and self sufficient.  I don't raise children to grow up to be dependant and unsuccessful.  You have your method of child rearing, I have mine.  If you don't like my advice, don't listen.  MANY people do like my advice, and many people enjoy the way the children I've raised have turned out, than you very much. :)|`|XChiSgDZaa	there are benifits to both. I have heard horrible stories about facilities to. Just do your research and ask qeustions. In alot of states the have a website to check if a person or center have had any violations also you can contact your local department of human services ( place where you apply for state aid) and they normally can give you info on providers. My daughter is in a home based daycare but the big plus is that the provider is a dear friend of mine so I dont have much thought to it.|`|ax57ni78aa	As a mother of a 3 year old girl this is really scary stuff. But as a woman who has worked in daycare for over 13 years, I will let you know that you as a parent have to do the research on these day cares. I live in Texas and I know that there is a website that list all of the registered day cares in the whole state. (<a href="http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/If" rel="nofollow">http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/If</a> scroll down to the bottom and select Search Texas Child Care, then enter your zip code) If your daycare is not on the list, then it is running illegal, and should be brought to the state's attention. I know that all home day cares in Texas that have 12 children are supposed to have criminal background checks run on all family members living in the house who are over the age of 14. Like I said it is up to us as parents to make sure our children are safe.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	There are benefits to in-home day cares and there are some really, really great ones out there.<br>  <br>  My oldest was in an in-home daycare until his right femur bone was broken in her care at the age of 7 months.  Now, I make sure there is MORE than 1 person watching my children.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	This could happen anywhere. It could happen in a daycare center, it could happen at the park, it could happen in your own backyard by the elderly neighbor who loves to sit outside when the children play.<br>  <br>  I don't think this makes all home daycare bad. Not at all.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	you can find creeps anywhere, not just home daycare.  In our city, a school bus driver did it to the last kid left on the bus at the end of the run.  Who would have thought?  Priests do it. Literally, creeps are everywhere.  A home daycare, particularly a small one, can be heads above one of those big ones, more personal care, etc.  You have to check it out carefully, ask and check references and ask to see state license, if applicable, and best of all, watch closely, turn up early now and then to pick the kids up, observe everything.  It is scary.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Honestly, abuse happens everywhere. In home day cares, day care facilities, and even family based childcare. It's sad that it's so hard to trust people. Even grandparents, aunts, uncles and siblings have been proven to abuse (sexually or otherwise) the child/ren they are assigned to watch. Abuse can happen anywhere, regardless qualifications of the providers, the daycare size, or the licenses.|`|vcNvEIOwaa	this could happen in a regular day care too though.....personally.....I WAS abused in an in home day care by the husband of the wife who was suppose to be caring for us. BUT..I would not rule out all home facilities....Its up to the parents to really research the place their kids will go. Interview these people and ask them questions that would reveal their character. I wouldn't really want to go with a place that had a lot of kids anyway.....I would want somewhere with very few kids...people just need to learn to be a good judge of character.....but if they have no morals themselves to try and do this would be close to impossible.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Well, yeah. This is why I stay home with my daughter...<br>  <br>  <br>  Re. Mrs Heather Schabby's answer: Mrs Heather Schabby doles out loads of...what she might think of as no-nonsense, and what I think of as mean, advice on here. Time to let 'em cry it out, etcetera. Another reason I would not put my own child in a day care no matter how great the references etcetera.
LqimEAfWaa	Does each student have a different mascot?  Or is it the same picture for each child?  If they have different pictures, then I would first only have about 3 different ones and let the children pick which one they want to color.  If it's all the same then I wouldn't worry about that part.<br>  <br>  I would ask the child why he doesn't want to color the picture.  It could be that the child is feeling sick, can't find their colors, doesn't like the picture, or any number of reasons.  Once the reason is known then it is easier to determine how to go about solving the problem.<br>  <br>  The last thing I would do is punish the child for refusing to color.  I would simply tell him that it can be taken home for homework, and find an alternate assignment for that child to do.<br>  <br>  If this is a one time thing, then I wouldn't push it too much.  However, if the child is consistently refusing to do coloring activities in school, then I would talk with the parents about it and work with them to see if there is anything we could do to encourage the child to color in school.<br>  <br>  Again, punishment would be the absolute last resort.  If I did use punishment then it would only be a short time out, or not get to do something special with the rest of the class.  Again, it would be the last resort.  I would try everything else first to find out why the child refuses to color.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	This depends on the history with this child.  If this is one of the few times he is refusing to do something, you find out why and find an alternative for him to do (still sticking with the general assignment...perhaps tracing the letters on the page, writing a sentence on the back about the mascot, etc.)  The drawing can be sent home to color, but again, if it is a one-time deal and he usually colors...I just let it go.<br>  <br>  If this is a child that repeatedly refuses to color, you address that.  Some children just don't enjoy coloring, so you encourage what little they will do.  Colored pencils, markers, etc. are a fun alternative that can *sometimes* get these type of children more interested in coloring.<br>  <br>  If this is a child that repeatedly refuses to do anything....you send him out.  (Along with many other things, conferences, etc...that answer is just for the sake of the coloring assignment.)  Schools have different set ups, but the most recent one I was at had a "rec room," where these particular children could be sent to finish their assignments in quiet with the resource teacher one-on-one.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I would of done what my teachers did.Those that refused or did not finish have the chance to finish it for homework.And explain to the child why it is important to get your work done.If they do not get it done its there choice.Maybe a timeout or no play time.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	I'd ask them why they didn't want to color the picture, tell them that it was an assignment and that they need to get it done because assignments are important, if they still refused I would probably punish him or her or call in back up reinforcements. I want to be a teacher and I am in college for it, if you become soft the children will walk all over you. You can't just say oh I refuse to do my warm up math assignments in middle school so you shouldn't be allowed to say that in kindergarten.<br>  <br>  ETA: I'd tell them to go sit by themselves until they could feel as if they could rejoin the group and participate. If the child had a mental disability it would be different. LIttle kids need reinforcement, sorry; that's why we need supernanny because people don't know how to reinforce how children should act.<br>  <br>  ETA: If the child still refused, I would probably talk to his or her parents; especially if it was a reoccuring event. Throwing temper tantrums isn't tolerated in school; sorry if I sound strict but I was always well behaved in school and at home and that was because the adults in my life were strict.|`|lbAVMiILaa	I would try to find out why he/she did not want to color the picture and just try to give him/her reinforcement and if that would not work go ahead and let them know that maybe it can be something fun for them to share with their family|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i would ask him why he dosnt want to color it, then ask him if he would rather take it home and color it with mom or dad..<br>  he is only what, 5, so they are still at that age...kindergarden teachers, for the most part, are understanding of the age.|`|prckcKLYaa	Psychology teacher?|`|sbeoF50gaa	1st. I talk to the child and figure out what the dilemma is.  If I were a teacher I'd be using the "red light yellow and green light" system when a child misbehaves or does not do the work assigned to them they get put on yellow and if on yellow get put on red, once on red you get a time out.  I would have let it go and moved on to the next activity. She had a choice to do the work and stay on green or not to the work and be put on yellow. I then would have  Allowed her to be involved in the next activity and getting her color back to green again for participating. In which case she would have seen the positive side of doing the activities everyone else is doing and maybe next time coloring her picture as told. By using the "lights" as a warning for not doing your work you show the child they can get into trouble, ultimately getting into time out but also they see they get rewarded for being "good"<br>  <br>  I also agree with the many posting that they should take it home for homework.<br>  <br>  :edit: I've always gone by the age of the child is how long time out is for. If your kid is 5, she should get 5 minutes of time out.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	my kids' kindergarten teacher could talk a cat into jumping into a river.  most k teachers would probably manage to change the kid's mind by being a good combination of supportive, encouraging, and firm.<br>  <br>  but if that didn't work, i like maureen's answer.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I'd ask him to bring it home for homework.  <br>  <br>  Happened to my son quite a bit in kindergarten.  Coloring is not something that he really enjoys doing & that's fine.<br>  <br>  ETA:  When he brought the work home, we would talk about how he could have gotten it done at school, instead, freeing up more playtime at home.  We'd talk about how his refusal to do the work at school was not polite to his teacher, since she worked to create the lesson plan and was not polite to his classmates, since he took the teacher away from them while she talked to him about it.  We'd work with him to create habits that were more polite and time efficient for him.  <br>  <br>  The 'consequence' of losing playtime at home and of losing something in his relationship with his peers and his teacher, seems like lesson enough.<br>  <br>  ETA: I do agree that children need to learn how to politely do as they are asked by their teachers, when they are asked to do it, before the work gets too hard & before the independent work becomes necessary to the learning process.  <br>  <br>  But, learning takes time, foundation building & lots of mistakes along the way.  Kindergarten is the first step for many kids to learning the how & why of doing what your teacher asks you to do.  <br>  <br>  Just like I know that, eventually, my son will need to learn how to drive a car on his own, that doesn't mean that I'll expect him to know how to do it now when he's 9 years old - I also know that he didn't need to be punished in kindergarten for not doing his work, instead he needed to learn why it was important and how to build good work habits.
vue9NOhYaa	Sounds like she's been ready for a while now.<br>  <br>  Pitch the babyfood and let her eat. (Of course you'll want to avoid honey for another month or two, and choking hazards like nuts and raw veggies until she's able to chew them well.)|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i let my daughter set the pace. she knew what she wanted and when she was ready for it. by 11 months my  daughter wouldn't even drink formula she would only take the whole milk and the same with food at one point she refused to eat the baby food so i started feeding her bits of what we would be eating then she decided that she wanted what we were having all the time. as long as she showed no signs of digestive problems or allergies i just started giving her what we were having. i talked to the pediatrician about it and he told me that it's fine as long as she isn't having problems.<br>  and i have found that the earlier i started giving her different choices of foods the more she would be willing to eat and try the new foods. which has helped her to NOT be a picky eater|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	If she can eat it and she is fine then you can switch her.  Just make sure tha twhat you are feeding her is healthy, not junk or filled with salt.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	go with the pace of the baby just watch her closley when she is eating incase she does choke you are right there|`|kf1PWDb8aa	No I don't thinks it is to early Just make sure you are chopping it up for her. Make sure she is getting her veggies and fruits lots of adults don't eat there fair share so make sure you are making her some. Good Luck!!|`|AA11611165	At 10 months, my baby was smashing on table foods. Just watch if she chokes or has pooping problems, and stuff like that...Besides that, if she can chew it and is doing fine. let her go. its all godd-_-|`|9DpbUdKcaa	my son was the same way, he was never a fan of the baby food.  As long as she is digesting everything ok and she is getting plenty of fruits and veggies in her diet then table food it great!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Sounds like shes ready to make the full switch. Congrats mom!
hElfBPZwaa	I gave birth to my babe naturally at home with no interventions and no drugs. I didn't tear or even have any "skid"marks. Other than feeling tired, I didn't have any pain. <br>  <br>  The more  interventions you have the longer your recovery is likely to take. If you have an epidural you won't be able to feel your pelvic floor which can result in more damage to your pelvic floor. Too strenuous pushing can also cause this. And obviously there is more healing time if you get an episiotomy.<br>  <br>  You will probably want to take it easy for several weeks regardless and just snuggle in with your new baby.<br>  <br>  C-sections have a lot more recovery time and carry a much greater risk to both you and your baby. A natural birth is safest for you and your baby and makes you feel empowered.  All the better if you can find care providers who won't push an episiotomy, an induction, an epidural or other interventions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11210211	I would suggest you try vaginal before opting for a c-section,I had a c-section with both of my children,I can't give birth vaginally so I have no choice.It takes about 3 to 4 weeks for the actual incision to heal on the outside but it can take up to 2 yrs for you to fully heal inside,|`|f949a6440379e23438eb10c50bdfb4abaa	I had a C-section 5 months and it was not bad at all. The first week I needed help at home (watching the baby and doing other things to help me out). There was pain the first time I got out of bed (the day after the C-section), but it healed pretty well. I was up again and just about back to myself in about 2 weeks. Good luck!|`|vBR9nB81aa	Even if you have not yet healed completely, you can still return to school as normal, as long as your doctor says so, and you feel up to it. I had a natural birth and it took me about 4 weeks to feel normal again and to heal up to where I felt normal in my vaginal area. At 6 weeks when I went back to my doctor for my post-partum check up I was a little sore, but I was healed completely. If you have a C-section birth it will take a little longer to heal up, and get back to your normal activities. If this is your first birth, and you plan on having more children, I suggest you go vaginal. It is my personal opinion but talk to your doctor about the pros and cons. Good luck girl!|`|CsnIpuNvaa	I had a natural (vaginal) birth and felt fine the next day.  That could be due to the fact that my baby was born premature, so he was only 4 and half pounds.  Because he was so small that perhaps made it easier.  My roommate in my hospital room had a C-section.  She couldn't even walk.  A C-section takes longer to heal than a vaginal birth.  Plus, you really get to experience the beauty and awe of birth when it's vaginal.|`|ugsfuQQcaa	A C-section will take longer to heal.  A vaginal birth would take about 3 - 6 weeks, especially if you have an epesimotemy (can't spell)  If you have a c-sect, it could take months to fully heal or longer if there were issues.|`|yS4GKSHRaa	I had a c-section after being in hard labor for 24 hours.  <br>  <br>  For about 2 weeks it was nearly impossible to get to a sitting position in bed by myself.  But with every week that went by it was hard to imagine how much worse I had felt the week before.  I had a fairly physical job and I went back to work after my 6 week checkup.  I'm pretty tough and I worked through a lot of pain.  <br>  <br>  My son is 7 months old and my scar still hurts a bit.  Some people say their scar hurts for a year or so, but this isn't a pain that would keep me from doing anything I want to do.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend a c-section to anyone who could choose to have an uncomplicated vaginal birth but as the risks of vaginal birth go up, a c-section may be a better option for a positive outcome.  <br>  <br>  I think it's wonderful that you are looking at both options.  <br>  <br>  This is a very emotionally driven subject.  I didn't want a c-section but it happened.  It taught me (the hard way) that it's as important to be flexible as it is to be prepared. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!
AA10730513	1, I would look into what their convictions were and if they were repeat offenders. I mean, are we talking serial killers who target women and children? Or some guys who got caught with drugs 1 too many times and were awaiting placement in a drug rehab problem?<br>  <br>  #2, assuming the answer to #1 didn't make me feel like their prime target, I would go about life the same way that I should every day. But I would be more cautious about making sure I remembered to lock the doors and windows and to only answer the door to people I know. I would make sure my phone was charged and to keep any defenses I have such as pepper spray on me when I go out and where I can get to them easily if needed in the house. <br>  <br>  #3, I would watch the story unfold and try to relax and go about life semi-normally. After all, statistics are on your side. How likely that they would target you for a brutal crime? Are you responsible for getting them locked up? <br>  <br>  You should be ok. Having your mom and sister home gives you that whole safety in numbers thing. But I bet these guys are hiding out somewhere, and/or heading to get out of the state ASAP.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I am really not the least bit concerned lol<br>  Idk if you know anyone who was ever in jail but they arent people with rabies, and the last thing on their mind, usually, is doing anything that would get them remotely close to going back there, until that wears off after a couple months/years, they are on good behavior.<br>  Just be a little more watchful, I guess.|`|MnzX5quAaa	well don't panic and keep your doors locked, if you see any suspicious persons around just call the police, and keep some pepper spray on you if you go out,|`|562qoBUUaa	Lock the doors when you're at home.  Don't be afraid to go out and about, just keep your phone close and and eye out.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	theres nothing you should be overly worried about ..just keep doors and windows locked and you'll be fine.|`|MA9XuLlHaa	People should grow up before havng kids!!!|`|XLsnuAqmaa	it does happen every so often.  keep your doors locked and try to stay inside...|`|AXEqOEloaa	Have you checked the basement/attic?|`|3Ewo8Pgzaa	I would make the same precautions that I make every day, locking my doors etc.  I wouldn't do anything special.  <br>  <br>  Those men escaped cages, but they aren't animals.

We live near many prison/jail facilites, and have had escapes on occassion.  I pretty much start wondering whenever I hear a helicopter circling the area.  I'd just be careful, that's all.  Make sure you lock your doors, including car doors when they are parked outside, even at home.  We had one escapee who was hiding in various unlocked vehicles here.  Don't go out at night if you can help it, or at least not alone.  Don't go out alone, period, actually.  Just be cautious and use common sense.<br>  <br>  ETA - PS - for those of you who think guys who escape from jail aren't dangerous - THEY CAN BE!  One prisoner who escaped here broke into a home at night and beat up the guy who lived there, just to steal some weapons for his own protection before moving on!  Yeah, they usually just want to get back to where they came from, but they will do anything necessary to get there and protect themselves.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	1. Keep all windows, doors, and garage locked up.<br>  2. Don't go out alone during the day or at night.<br>  3. Don't be afraid to call the police if you see strange people in your neighborhood.<br>  4. Don't answer the door to anyone. No matter how nice they seem.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Don't worry about it too much.<br>  <br>  I would lock the doors and windows, and avoid watching CSI which I have done in the worst of times. Called the cops on a meter reader once. Nuff said.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well, it honestly depends on the age of the children and where we lived and if i had to leave the house it would depend on where i had to go or how far i had to go.
kiAQi91laa	When my oldest daughter was 5 months old we traveled from Brunswick, GA to Fort Hood, TX.  The travel went pretty smooth even when we a trailer hauling our stuff.  My daughter slept most of the time and we stopped like every 2-3 hours to check her diapers and give her a good stretch from the car seat.  <br>  <br>  Now, we didn't have two dogs in the car either.  If you're dogs are pretty big or overactive, I'd reconsider taking them with you and place them luxury dog boarding/pet resort...that way they can have a mini vacation too.<br>  <br>  I used playtex drop in bottles that I measured water in them and added the formula when she needed feeding.  These days some formula is already measured like Enfamil singe packets, one packet for a 4 oz bottle and two are needed for 8 oz bottles.  It's a bit more expensive, but it'll make the trip easier than having to scoop baby formula at a rest stop or in your vehicle.  Maybe even measure the formula and put it in a very small plastic baggies.  Buy and bring baby food that can be purchase in small plastic containers (gerber 2nd foods) that way you don't have to worry about the jars hitting each other and waking the baby up during the drive or even broken glass.<br>  <br>  I used cloth diapers, but for the trip to FT Hood from GA I purchased disposable diapers.  I didn't want to smell dirty diapers and deal with the mess in the car or at a rest stop/restaurant.

sgMno1PRaa	Im 18 weeks and I havnt been touched once by my midwife, Actually I have once when we listened to the heart beat|`|A1S5KNUkaa	My midwife felt to see how high my uterus was at my 16 wk appointment but I think it's dependant on who you see to be honest.|`|dDVAUA9saa	My midwife started feeling the size and shape of my uterus at my first appointment at 9 weeks.|`|jiTKnCKpaa	They don't normally check the fundal height until about 20 - 24 weeks so yes she is doing her job properly, the baby isn't really high up enough now.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	I asked my midwife where he was and she checked, not sure if she would have if i'd not asked though|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	yeah im 29 wks with twins and still they dont feel where they are|`|oWAUb6vpaa	You should be happy with your midwife / doctor and not have to 2nd guess what s/he's doing. And you're right, she's supposed to feel your belly to look for the fundal height which will tell her if you're belly is growing as is should be. Get a new mid-wife. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations mom!|`|wTYh7DiSaa	They feel the size of your fundus at 20 weeks, This is when your fundal height should correlate with your number of week (i.e. 20 cm = 20 weeks). She is doing her job as far as I can tell.|`|oCTG5IVvaa	at my 11 week booking in appointment she felt my tummy to see if my womb was coming up out of hips yet, then i saw a different midwife for 16 weeks appointment and she didn't...so i don't think it's unusual...i hope she tried to find heartbeat for you though? x
wTYh7DiSaa	Heart burn is usually felt in the chest area and the throat. it is a slow dull burning feeling. Mine usually spreads over my chest area. No, it wouldn't just be on the left side because of the word "heart" in heart burn :) It is acid reflux, when the acid from your stomach backs up into your esophagus. Usually during pregnancy all of our organs are pushed and squished around to accomodate our little one, not to mention that we produce relaxin which of course relaxes muscles in preparation for labor. The side effect is that it also relaxes the muscles that prevents the back flow of stomach contents especially the acid.<br>  <br>  What you're descdribing sounds like heartburn but, not the part about back and arms. I looked it up and it sounds more like gallbladder problems (seeing that you do have a family history of it): gallbladder problems may lead to biliary colic, a condition marked by nausea, vomiting and severe upper abdominal or right-sided abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back.<br>  <br>  Call your doctor and mention BILIARY COLIC, "severe upper abdominal or right sided abdominal pain sometimes radiating to the back".|`|veO1RXrCaa	Oh honey Ive been there.  There is almost nothing as painful as a gall bladder attack.  Does it happen with what you eat?  Even something seemingly innocent like peanut butter had me in agony.  I didn't think of p.b as a fatty food but it was and I had the worst attack once after eating it.  Anyhow I got a ultrasound done and it turns out I had tiny gall stones.  I was in agony.  It was like heart burn mixed with a anxiety attack with someones knee in my sternum.  Heart burn will burn/hurt in the same area as a gall bladder attack.  Its the fact that all those remedies aren't treating it makes it seem more like your gall bladder.  Go to the hospital if you need to.  Don't suffer with this.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	Your gall bladder is not in your chest.<br>  <br>  Just to be safe, I would see your OB/GYN...female heart problems manifest themselves in many ways...Always better to check.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regards|`|7d6d1be3884cf46230d224bf7dd43f47aa	yes its your gallbladder.....have a sonogram of it done to look for gall stones.....i had a few attacks like you before i was pregnant but after i became pregnant they were worse and more frequent....i could only sleep sitting up in a chair and it would come and go as it pleased and nothing ever specifically triggered it nor did anything seem to help alleviate the pain (which was excrutiating for me).....i ended up having mine taken out 10 days after my son was born<br>  <br>  and yes i would go to the er...they are going to ask who your doctor is but i would tell them that you have spoken with him about it but would prefer a second opinion|`|Kaudz4Msaa	I think you may feel your gallbladder anywhere in your back, more likely than your front, from my experience with my mother's gall bladder polyps, at least.<br>  <br>  It is normal for babies to be placed with their feet on your right side, just under your ribs.  Pain may be around that area.  Mine was usually bad, but sometimes, my front was just numb!!  My baby liked to kick my liver, and I was told this is normal.  Gross, huh?! <br>  <br>  I would not worry about gallbladder in particular...why, are you prone to gallbladder problems?  I haven't heard about gallbladder relating to pregnancy, but I don't know.<br>  <br>  If your doctor is blowing you off, that is not a good sign.  I would highly recommend taking a natural childbirth class and switching from a doctor to an experienced midwife, like I did.  I was treated like a human being, and my baby was delivered beautifully and naturally.  Plus, I had lots of time to rest at home before delivery, I was not induced, and even though my labor was 36 hours, had no c-section.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  By the way, don't hesitate to go to your G.P. if there is a question of gallbladder...as I said I don't think it's very common in pregnancy, so the ob/gyn may not have too much experience with this.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I would go to a doctor that would do tests and screen you.  If you think the pain is bad enough, then go to the ER...but it may be easier and cheaper to make an appointment with a different doctor.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of heartburn so bad that it makes you cry.<br>  <br>  Here's a good article:<br>   Pregnancy symptoms you should never ignore<br>  Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board<br>  Last updated: June 2006<br>  <br>  How do you know whether that sudden ache is normal or warrants a 2 a.m. call to your doctor or midwife? Here's a rundown of symptoms that should set off your warning bells. But even if you don't see your symptom on this list, it's better to err on the side of caution and make that call than to agonize for hours, wondering whether you've pulled a ligament or gone into preterm labor.<br>  <br>  Note that some of these symptoms may be more or less urgent depending on your particular situation or health history and on how far along you are in your pregnancy. Ask your practitioner to review with you which signs warrant an urgent call at various points in your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  ? Your baby is moving or kicking less than usual (once he begins moving regularly). Ask your caregiver if you should monitor your baby's activity by doing daily "kick counts." She can give you specific instructions on how to count and when to call.<br>  <br>  ? Severe or persistent abdominal pain or tenderness.<br>  <br>  ? Vaginal bleeding or spotting.<br>  <br>  ? An increase in vaginal discharge or a change in the type of discharge — that is, if it becomes watery, mucousy, or bloody (even if it's only pink or blood-tinged). Note: After 37 weeks, an increase in mucus discharge is normal and may indicate that you'll be going into labor soon.<br>  <br>  ? Pelvic pressure (a feeling that your baby is pushing down), lower back pain (especially if it's a new problem for you), menstrual-like cramping or abdominal pain, or more than four contractions in an hour (even if they don't hurt) before 37 weeks.<br>  <br>  ? Painful or burning urination, or little or no urination.<br>  <br>  ? Severe or persistent vomiting, or any vomiting accompanied by pain or fever.<br>  <br>  ? Chills or fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.<br>  <br>  ? Visual disturbances such as double vision, blurring, dimming, flashing lights, or "floaters" (spots in your field of vision).<br>  <br>  ? Persistent or severe headache, or any headache accompanied by blurred vision, slurred speech, or numbness.<br>  <br>  ? Any swelling in your face or puffiness around your eyes, anything more than a little swelling in your hands, severe and sudden swelling of your feet or ankles, or a rapid weight gain (more than 4 pounds in a week).<br>  <br>  ? A persistent or severe leg cramp or calf pain that doesn't ease up when you flex your ankle and point your toes toward your nose or when you walk around, or one leg being significantly more swollen than the other.<br>  <br>  ? Trauma to the abdomen.<br>  <br>  ? Fainting, frequent dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, or heart palpitations.<br>  <br>  ? Difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, or chest pain.<br>  <br>  ? Severe constipation accompanied by abdominal pain or severe diarrhea that lasts more than 24 hours.<br>  <br>  ? Persistent intense itching of your torso, arms, legs, palms, or soles, or a feeling of itchiness all over your body.<br>  <br>  ? Any health problem that you'd ordinarily call your practitioner about even if it's not pregnancy related (like worsening asthma or a cold that gets worse rather than better). Just call a little sooner than you would normally.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure whether a symptom is serious, you don't feel like yourself, or you're uneasy, trust your instincts and call your healthcare provider. Your practitioner expects such calls. If there's a problem, you'll get help right away. If nothing's wrong, you'll be reassured.<br>  <br>  Your body is changing so rapidly that it's hard to know whether what you're experiencing is "normal." Do yourself and your baby a favor and get any unusual symptoms checked out.|`|iR9w7d7Yaa	You need to push for them to give you a scan of your chest/tummy area to rule out gallbladder problems. I have had my gall bladder out (exactly a year ago yesterday) and gall bladder pain is excruitiating. I was on all sorts of pain killers and could hardly move some days. <br>  If it is your gall bladder then i do know that they will removed it after the first trimester but i think they would recommend that you wait until after you have had your baby.<br>  On the other hand it could be heartburn as that can be nasty too! I have never had heartburn like i have had during my pregnancy.<br>  Hope this helps a little.
Fkl6gV8Qaa	It really depends on your family history. All the women on my mom's side of the family carry to 41 weeks every time. The same has held mostly true for me (gave birth at 42 weeks the first time). I know how frustrating it can be to go over your due date.|`|bK5f2p38aa	My first baby came out at 39 weeks, i hope the second comes at the same time because i feel soooooooo much tired than the first time, congratulations!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Both my babies came at exactly 38 weeks.  <br>  <br>  If your already dilated and effaced a little, I would start walking.  I walked for three hours the day I went into labor.|`|sv4guUQNaa	My 1st came at 38 weeks, every woman/pregnancy is different.|`|hVVALFAPaa	The baby does not know how to read a calendar so she will come whenever she is ready!<br>  <br>  Babies USUALLY come when mommy is between 38- 42 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  Most doctors will not let you be pregnant past 42 weeks. They will probably do an induction to put you into labor. It is not good for the baby to be in there for more than 42 weeks as the placenta (the part that gives the baby his nourishment) won't work so good past then. The baby will not be getting enough nourishment then.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CLm2dX1faa	I would just be prepared. Pack you bag clean your home do not leave any laundry etc. you will have so much to do when you come home from the hospital. Take care or yourself now (shave your legs,give yourself a facial) It may sound like nonsense but you will appreciate a clean home and a little pampering when your little baby arrives. <br>  It will happen soon. so enjoy this time your life will never be the same again.|`|ZKkZWiM9aa	babies can come up to 10 days late,even wait the extra 2 weeks before having to be induced,they can get comfy in there,and its been very cold lately,i never knew when mine were gona come,they just fell out when they pleased,usually got labour hour before if i was lucky lol.|`|65RZ441Zaa	My girl was 10 days early ,and my boy was 10 days late, and they 1lb apart. All pregnancys are diffrent, sit back and relax, maybe do some scrap booking to pass time. She'll come when you Least expect it :)<br>  good luck and congrats!!!|`|mldo1vxYaa	It could be any time between now and 42 weeks, most first time mums go late but everyone is different. Remember your due date is just an estimate thats why they will allow you to be overdue.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	everyone is different but you are close, they wont let you go over 42 so even if you dont go by 41 you dont have much longer to wait. were inducing on sunday at 39.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	i had my first baby a week early, and my second right at 40 weeks. so it all depends on your body and if they baby wants to come on out.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	My first and only baby, was born two weeks early. Whenever they're ready, they'll come out.|`|vjoyv5J6aa	Everyone is different, but she will be here soon. I bet you're excited. I'm at 33 weeks and have a scheduled C-Section cause of a back injury. My Sister-In-Law was 38 weeks and her water broke, my cousin was 5 WEEKS LATE!!! no lie and the baby weighed 10lbs 1oz. WOW If this is you're first plan on waiting, but get all your stuff packed and ready to go. Don't forget snacks! Anyone who may stay will you in the hospital, make sure they have clothes and a tooth brush also. Good Luck!|`|a8ws0XVtaa	They say that most first time mothers have their babies late, but due dates are just an estimate so you never know. My water broke at 39 weeks and now I'm a first time mommy to a 5 week old baby boy.  Congrats and Good luck - get rest now because you won't get it after your little girl comes.|`|xm1NjRqSaa	The Midwife told me you can go 2 weeks early or 2 weeks late, So any where from 37 to 42    Good Luck !  Enjoy your self till D day !! :)|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	babies come whenever they are ready not wen  you want them to. but who knows today might be your day just make sure you gat everything ready because it will suprise you|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i think if you havent gone by 42 weeks they help you out  hey good luck honey lucky u i have 12 weeks to go|`|1tmX7xbRaa	no it's not true that you will go into labor at 41 weeks the first time. you can be early or you can be late it all depends on the woman. with my first daughter i was over a week late and they had to induce labor.
efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Wow, so glad it ended OK.  I had an episode like that....all six of us went to the mall and we had the older kids (12 and 10 at the time) and the baby and toddler....we were at a crossroads in the mall looking at some artwork and suddenly I realized the toddler was not there.  We all assumed someone else in the family was watching him.  Immediately we all split up running (four directions to chose from) and I found him just walking along like he knew where he was going.<br>  <br>  It scared me soooooooooooooooooooo much!  I know just how you feel, it's the worst feeling and my heart goes out to the families of missing children too~!|`|AA12145826	My daughter is 6, but when she was about 4 1/2 she thought it would be funny to hide in the clothing rack at the store. I had a hold of her hand one minute, I bent over to pick up a scarf I knocked over and when I straightened up and looked around, she was gone, like GONE. I FREAKED! I mean I was screaming her name and shouting for my husband in the middle of Sears. I was running from rack to rack all around the section and plus we were right near an entrance into the mall so store employees were running out there to see if they could see her. I was bawling, oh it was awful. I really thought I was going to die.You don't know what fear is like until your child does something like that.<br>  <br>  After about 5-6 minutes of shear panic, just as suddenly as she disappeared she popped out of the clothing rack next to me. I went from shear fear & panic to elation to a brief moment of "I'm going to kill her" back to elation. Turns out the little bugger was right there the whole time. She was super sneaky and stood up on the cross bars so when I did a quick look under the clothes and such I didn't see her feet. She's been handcuffed to me for every trip to the store since than.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Awww, this made me cry. <br>  <br>  <br>  One morning I went into my bathroom to pee real quick and I could see my son sitting in the living room playing with his toy's. When I went to grab the toilet paper, he jumped up and went out of my view.<br>   When I came out of the bathroom he wasn't in the living room. I checked in every imaginable spot you could think of, and started to really panic. So I was running from his room to the living room and felt this super cold breeze. The sliding glass door got Unlocked so hunter opened the door and slipped out back and the blinds were still closed. I peeked through the blinds and he let out this excited yelp and went running into the pouring rain. It was pretty cold outside and he was in his pajama's with socks on : [  He was happy to take a bath.<br>   That was really scary.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	It happened to me on Saturday. I stopped to get something out for the baby and my 3 year old wandered off. I assumed (my fault i suppose for assuming) that my MIL would watch her as I was busy with the baby. When I realised she was gone, a woman noticed my panic and said, 'there's a little girl wearing pink up that way', and pointed. As I sprinted off (after making sure this time that my MIL could watch the baby), I heard her shouting, 'mummy'. I got to her and all was well.<br>  It was ages before my heart slowed down, it was awful.<br>  I heard a story about a supermarket not to far from where I am. A woman was looking through clothes racks and someone lifted her baby girl out of the trolley. She alerted a security guard who put the whole store on immediate lock-down and called the police. After an extensive search, they only found a couple of eastern european immigrants in the customer toilets with a little boy. Thankfully, a policeman noticed hair in the sink and asked them to strip the boy. It was the little girl - they had cut her hair and changed her clothes.<br>  Thank GOD for a quick security guard and a sharp-eyed policeman. I can only imagine how that mother was feeling.|`|6J6S6ECoaa	This happened with one of my grandchildren when we were in Tesco's. I told one of the check out girls and the doors of the store were closed until we found him.That was important that the child did not get out or be taken out of the store by a stranger .|`|EvMvSHULaa	This happened with my son when he was 3 1/2...only it was at Sea World!  We thought he was with his poppa going to the restroom, Poppa thought he was still with us.  When Poppa got back with no son I literally could not breathe.  We found him, after only 3 or 4 min. standing at the top of the stadium with someone who worked for the park, as he'd been told to do in that situation.  But for those few minutes, my world crashed....to this day when I think about it, I still lose my breath.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	scary stuff, but small town or not, this just goes to show not to leave your children alone in public stores....u are lucky the outcome was what it was...|`|xi7mq1xGaa	I don't have kids yet but I've been in the place of the child. When I was 5 my mum's friend took me and my then 7 year old brother to the swimming pool in our nearest big town along with her son who was also 7 and was my brother's best friend. At the pool the 2 boys had a bit of an argument, and as my brother was a typical older brother and not always that nice to me I took the other boy's side! Once we left we were going to go to McDonalds so set off walking, with my brother's friend and me walking a little behind, grumbling about how mean my brother was, etc etc. We didn't notice when the adult and my brother stepped into a shop, and so we just carried on walking. I don't know how much later it was, but can't have been more than a couple of minutes, but we realised we didn't know where they were. We wandered around for a bit, and then decided they might be in McDonalds (lol, being little kids we didn't realise an adult would cancel all plans immediately to search for us!) so we walked there, which was a good ten minute walk away. Thank God I was with this slightly older boy as I have a horrible sense of direction so don't know what I would have done on my own, or where I would have ended up! Anyway, they obviously weren't there so we kept walking around the town looking for them. I think we were missing for about half an hour. Eventually we saw them just as they saw us. Mum's friend was busy talking to a policeman at the time. He gave us a bit of a lecture about not wandering off. The boy cried but I was very stoical and just nodded in the right places! The worst part for me was afterwards when we did actually go to McDonalds (she was so thankful to have us back she still gave us the treat!) and Mum's friend told me she would have to tell my mum what had happened. I was mortified as I knew my mum would tell me off for not staying close by the adult. I think it must have been truly awful for her - losing her own child and someone else's!<br>  <br>  Another time my brother got lost in Central London when he was about 4. I don't remember as I was 2 but I was there too with my mum and we'd been to visit my dad who was in hospital with a skin complaint. My mum said my brother disappeared in a split second at the entrance to the Tube station. A big group of kids on a trip was milling around and Mum was worried he'd got caught up with them. Luckily it was only a few minutes before she found him looking a bit worried. He'd been looking at Big Ben. He said 'Mummy, if I'd stayed lost, next week you would have had to have told Daddy I'm lost.' Mum replied 'If you'd stayed lost another few minutes Daddy would have been out in his pyjamas looking for you!'|`|AkFag8tNaa	I was at Sears when my oldest was 2. We were looking at clothes and he darted away. I couldn't find him and had an elderly woman help me (he was hiding in one of the racks of clothes. I sat him on top of a washing machine model and lectured him w/tears streaming down my face.  So glad she's o.k!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Thank God, it ended well with her being with your husband. That is one of my main fears, losing my children to never see them again. I honestly get terrified even at the thought and I do not know how I would survive without either of them.

VwMkiLFPaa	You’re here right now aren’t you?<br>  <br>  Get angry with her all you want, but you don’t know what was going on during that time. You don’t know her situation, her status, her mindset. <br>  <br>  I’m sure you would feel a bit “wow” because that’s some big information. But again, there are two sides to every story and quite honestly, that’s your mother! She did carry you for 9 months and she brought you on this earth. <br>  <br>  Why judge her for what she “almost” did?<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  <br>  But may I ask you what YOUR stance is on abortion? Could your anger be towards the fact she believes in abortion to begin with? <br>  <br>  Not trying to cause a debate, I'm just curious if this could have played a part in your anger/trust.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	There are many women who have been lied to.  Told that it's not a baby, just a mass of cells or tissue, told that a fetus is not a baby and that it's not painful.  When an abortion is described toa woman the word baby is never used.  It is usually "clearing out the contents of the uterus".  So many woman make the decision under the illusion that there is not a real living being residing and growing in them.  So many women find out the truth after they've done it and regret it so deeply, or they happen to see the dead baby pulled apart in a container afterward and realize what they have done.  Abortion is one of the biggest lies out there.  Be thankful that your mom had you, she got past the lie and I'm willing to bet she is thankful everyday that she didn't do it.  <br>  One thing that you could do is talk to her about it.  Find out what she knew or what she was told about who you were.  What made her change her mind, and then do some research yourself on the abortion lie and teach others about what it truly is.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	yes-she had never been a mother before-how can you know how much you will love your child till you have it.its something no one else can explain to you. seriously-if she has been a good and loving mother to you your whole life,this shouldnt even be an issue.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	she DID have you is how u should see it now<br>  its very normal for a woman to panic when she 1st finds out shes pregnant<br>  my mum didnt know what to do when she had me!! she kept me and is pleased she did <br>  im sure your mum has no regrets x x|`|F6lZHRkVaa	So many children weren't planned or wanted when their mothers first became pregnant. I would think my mother was just confused and scared, so many moms are. Just because you were unwanted when she was pregnant doesn't mean she doesn't love you with all her heart now.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	My Egg & Sperm wanted to abort me, after they found out I was a girl. No one would do an abortion at that stage.<br>  <br>  I haven't had a relationship with them at all, not since 4yo, and I don't even care to. They are nothing to me.<br>  <br>  If you Mother actually stood up and raised you, your way out of line. I went years of abuse, eventually being placed in State care. They didn't want me, they hated me.<br>  By the sounds of it, your mum has been in your life. Falling pregnant can be a scary thing, especially when it's not planned.<br>  So you thank your mum by acting like a complete tool, after she raises you. Doesn't sound fair does it.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Yes, ----- She didn't abort you, and she's taken care of you your entire life.<br>  There's nothing wrong w/having doubts and being scared of having a baby!!  You don't know what kind of life she was having at the time, so you really shouldn't judge!  It may be a shock to find out, but get over yourself.  She obviously sacrificed and gave you a life...If I were in your position, I would walk up to her and tell her how glad you are that she didn't abort you, and that you're happy you have had the chance to know her, and that you LOVE her...|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yes i would just thank them for not doing it and try to understand what was going on to make them feel that they wanted one.<br>  try listening to Nick Cannon's song "Can I Live" his mom almost had an abortion with him and he made a song for her. It makes me cry every time i hear it. Just be grateful she gave you life.|`|AA12145826	Yes, I would still see my mother as a loving mother if she had at one time thought about aborting the pregnancy that resulted in my birth. As one poster pointed out, she didn't want to kill you. She considered terminating the pregnancy but instead chose to not only give birth but to keep the child resulting in that birth. That child was you. SHE CHOSE YOU!!<br>  <br>  And how dare your aunt bring up something that isn't even relevant today. What kind of hornet's nest was she hoping to stir up? How in God's name do you benefit from that kind of information? If you should lose trust in anyone, it should be your aunt.|`|GpR5MI5raa	you have to remember how different her life was before she had children. It wasnt a personal thing against you, she probably just wasnt sure if she was ready for a baby. But she kept you anyways, so im not sure why your so upset. try relating with your mother and her youth a little more. and to answer your question, it would not bother me if my mother had considered abortion with me, because she didnt do it.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	The important thing is that she DIDN'T go through with it.  Maybe she was just scared at first and needed some reassurance from your aunt and uncle.   Don't look at it like she wanted to kill you.  She didn't even know you at that point.  I think your aunt and uncle should have talked to your mother before they told you that she wanted to abort you.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Yes I would still see her as my loving mother - she CHOSE to have you - no one forced her and she obviosly raised you.  She was probably is shock and terrified at the news of a baby and sometimes we think stuff that when looking back - was very stupid. <br>  <br>  Point being - she is your mom - she is human.  Have you never made a mistake?|`|hJWjSWYXaa	I trust my mom completely! when I was 15 i asked her how she came up with my name so she told me this... When she got pregnant with me her and my dad were having really bad problems and she was planning on leaving him, well when she found out she was pregnant with me she didn't want my dad to know because she would end up staying with him and she didn't want that! My mom didn't have enough money for an abortion so she told my aunt(dad's sister) to push her down the stairs(yeah i know dangerous).So when my mom started having a miscarriage my dad took her to the hospital not knowing what had happened and she almost lost me! She said when the doctor told her she was having a miscarriage she couldn't believe that she did such a thing and prayed to god to let her keep me! Well as you can see I'm still here and my mom said that almost losing me is what made her realize that god wanted her to have me and that's why I have a religious name and my mother has always been proud of me! I trust her now more then ever because she could of gone Thu with an abortion I would of never been here! I LOVE MY MOM!|`|ODosyM8zaa	50% of the time when a woman gets pregnant with her first child, especially if she is single and/or young, she considers ALL her options. Wouldn't you want to know that if anything happened you had options? Obviously she chose not to abort for a reason. She also decided to raise you rather then give you up for adoption. So in my opinion yes, you can trust your mother. She is your mother and she obviously loves you!|`|bMyq2nOTaa	My birth mom put me up for private adoption, which didn't turn out so great, and I have no ill feelings toward her... Just wish it had been handled, differently.<br>  <br>  People have all kinds of thoughts, in life, and the fact that your mother chose NOT to abort you, should mean more than a thought she had (abortion), that she didn't act on.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	how old are you now, did you have a good child hood, food, clothing, education, spending money etc...<br>  i think to hold something against your mom now for something that was a thought many years ago is stupid. she loves you, and probebly cant imagine what life would be like had she of gone through with it those years ago. Untill you are in your mothers shoes, the ones she was in when she fell pregnant with you, you will never understand...so ease up.|`|113FoyMFaa	"she wanted to kill me at one point."<br>  <br>  She didn't want to kill YOU.  You weren't YOU at that point.  Understand, that everyone has a different opinion on abortions.|`|c88406c33ed216877628e7bfcb6d5c27aa	Shame on your aunt for telling you that.  I would be hurt knowing that information too.  Like others said, she made the right choice in the end.|`|zFT0FFogaa	Yes, because she chose NOT to. Cut her some slack!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	My biological mother did want to abort me.  She had two kids under 4 years old when she became pregnant with me and her husband made almost no money at all.  She decided not to due to my father's spiritual convictions and due to the fact that she could never bring herself to it.<br>  <br>  I still see her as a loving mother (though she's not the one I call mom because I was adopted at birth).  She considered abortion due to her circumstances.  I'm glad she chose life.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps your mom was in a similar circumstance when she conceived you.  I'm not condoning her telling you what she felt back then, but you can't lose all trust in your mom or even think she doesn't love you.  I understand though how you can feel that way, but I promise you that she does love you.
7rCeCVl2aa	My baby's favorite toy by far is his Leap Frog Discovery Ball<br>  <a href="http://azingzang.ecrater.com/product.php?pid=3482383" rel="nofollow">http://azingzang.ecrater.com/product.php...</a><br>  <br>  He loves making it spin but I can also take it off and he chases it. VERY cool toy. It only makes noise when they are being interactive with it. =) He started really playing with it at 7 1/2 or 8 months.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	My daughter LOVES her jumperoo and exersaucer. She'd rather play in them then be on the floor or play with anything else. She's 4 1/2 months now and started playing in/with them around 3 1/2 months old.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Aislings favourite toy is a teething cat that her grandpa got her for Christmas. She won't go to sleep without it at night lol. And for while shes awake, she loves her exersaucer, some blocks, her rattle and stuffed animals lol. <br>  She started actually playing with her toys when she was about 3-4 months.|`|14JQ11AUaa	My son has a walker, rain forest gym mat with tons of those attachable toys. We just got him this round ball thingy lol. It is a big round ball with animal shaped buttons and ribbons...hmm let me see if I can find a link for it, be right back :)<br>  <br>  My sons is a little different than this one but pretty similar.<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4726210" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  He also has this really cute steering wheel thing..<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5913449" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  He also has a few cool looking rattles, little animals that rattle and then some regular stuffed animals. We plan to go toy shopping soon, kind of excited :)<br>  <br>  So my fav is the v tech ball, it helps them learn to crawl. You turn it on and it sings learning songs and rolls on it's own...lights up! It is a real cool little toy, worth the money and my son absolutely LOVES it :)|`|yCwPxulYaa	<a href="https://www.downtowntoysandgames.com/vtech-roll-learn-ball-pr-419.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.downtowntoysandgames.com/vte...</a><br>  <br>  This is my daughters favorite toy.  She will kick it and it will roll away from her and she just watches it so intently and it flashes  lights and sings songs.  We got it at Wal-Mart.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	My son absolutely loves his ball pop by fisher price. It's def. his favorite toy. He got it about a month ago. So he was 9 months when he started playing with it.|`|TZzWGFNMaa	My daughter is only a month old so she still isn't doing much activity even though she is advanced for her age all she owns currently is stuffed animal (like pooh and tigger) and soft baby dolls and a few teddy bears!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My youngest is only 4 months, but she LOVES her rainforest jumparoo, and something called a Baby Shush from Tomy. Her face lights up at them every time.|`|kf1PWDb8aa	When they were little just a crib toy but now they have all the baby toys they need. I started playing with they at 3 months or showing them their toys!!
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	The same reason people get houses, cars, electronics, even pets that they can't afford...a lot worse when it is a living being, particularly a human child.<br>  <br>  I do understand not wanting to give up their child though.  I could never imagine giving up my baby.  Ever.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you can't control what other people do, only yourself.  But you can help by collecting items for them (do you have freecycle.org for your area?  or check the free section on craigslist.com...lots of people give away formula, food, baby clothes and items on there.)  There is also usually a program through gas/electric companies that helps people pay their bill...they may have to contact them for that though.  Finally, you can research the different places that will provide help for them and pass the info along...government funded, church groups, community programs, etc.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	There are tons of people that can't afford children but that doesn't change the fact that they are their children. Since when did you have to be rich to love a child? Since when did being poor mean you couldn't care for a child? This baby will have food, there is government assistance. This baby will have clothing (does it have to be designer? I think not) And this baby will have a roof over his head (there are homeless shelters) They are on disability for a reason. Not having money doesn't make them incapable of caring for their child. It doesn't mean they won't love this child. It means they will struggle way more than other more fortunate parents but it doesn't mean they should put the baby up for adoption because they are poor.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	if you full well know that you can not afford to take care of a child then i think it would be selfish to purposely become pregnant HOWEVER some people get pregnant and have money and good jobs, houses etc but then they loose their jobs. should those people have to give their kids up? sometimes people have hard times and sometimes people make bad choices. it doesn't mean they don't do their best as parents.|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	Maybe they COULD afford it when they fell pregnant, and never thought there may be a time when they would struggle for money??<br>  <br>  I was working full time when i fell pregnant, and was with my partner. I had severe PND, lost my job and then my partner had an affair, and i certainly never thought i would be a single mum on benefits.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	People are irresponsible.  I sincerely hope that they are not having this child for money.  I really believe that when people are at a certain poverty level, they do not see anyway out and they still want to exercise the right to have children.  So to them, being dirt poor and raising kids is an option because that is all they have ever known.  They are perpetuating a pattern that is most likely going to be followed by their children.  It is sad to see these cycles continue...<br>  <br>  You can encourage her to find childcare and apply for a job (he needs to as well).  You need to help them understand that living on assistance is no real way to live, and that they will forever be poor and hopeless unless they do something about it.  There are so many places that offer assistance for schooling, as well.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, you are a nice friend.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i didnt have money when i got pregnant with my first child. we had an eviction notice every other month and not much food in the house. the one thing we did have was clothing and food for our daughter and lots of love and support from friends and family. People do it every day. Just because you dont have money, dosnt make you a bad parent. there is lots of resources for people with no money and there is lots of jobs out there even people with a disability can do. you find a way to survive for your childrens sake. Yes, sometimes there are parents that are selfish and dont care about the kids and they are neglected and put in unsafe, unhealthy enviroments, but usualy a phone call is made and the children are taken away.<br>  support your friend however you can, and it dosnt have to be financially. Help her apply for food stamps, take her to the thrift stores for baby items, give her helpfull suggestion.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Because the government gives them the resources to.  Medicaid, WIC, welfare, you name it.  All are things that over used and abused too often.<br>  <br>  The same reason people run themselves into hundreds of thousands of dollars in credit card debt for cars they can't afford, houses they can't afford and keeping up with the Jones'.  <br>  <br>  People don't think about what is logical and best for the time being.  They just know "I want it, I want it now, so I'm going to get it now".  There is no sense of responsibility in this country today.  I don't understand it myself either.  Just because you want it right now doesn't mean you have to have it right now.<br>  <br>  If you really know of a baby living in the situation you described, then please contact social services for the well being of that baby.  For now, if you can contribute even some clothes, diapers or food for the baby please do.  Do what you can to help, even if you can't give money.  That baby deserves it even if the parents don't.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I think that a lot of people don't realize how expensive it is to have kids before they have them. That combined with poor birth control usage. <br>  <br>  he best thing you could do for your friends baby is call the state on them. It's cruel but maybe having their baby taken away would wake them up to support themselves OR the baby will just have a much better life for your efforts.
AA10922386	i had an hsg, and were clear, had clomid shortly after and ovulated, but nothing happened unfortnally, there was no real 'reason' it didnt happen which was really disapointing as i thought i'd get pregnant if i ovulated, i was on clomid for 6 months.<br>  <br>  now i have an appt at a proper fertilly clinic on 3rd march to discuss our options which will be either iui or ivf - scary stuff i know, but wot the hell im willing to give anything a go x<br>  <br>  good luck xx|`|O8TA4tMGaa	Hi,<br>  I had the HSG done.  No blockages either.  It didn't make getting pregnant easier.  I didn't take Clomid, although one of my doctors wanted me to.  I went the natural way which included nutrition, exercise, taking Vitex, Evening Primrose Oil, Flaxseed oil, drinking lots of water and baby carrots (to increase cervical mucus) and, most importantly, I let go of the need to get pregnant.  When I let go, I got pregnant the very next month and that was after 4 years of trying with no luck.  All the best!
3K7ffKn2aa	there is really nothing that can be done. I mean its sad but there is not law or anything saying parents have to care if their children "misbehave" i mean one person's definition of delinquent is not the same as another. It just a hard thing to describe (b/c everyone won't agree with the same definition). We just have to pray for them.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Um, first of all, mind your own damn business! You're not their parents, worry about your own, if you have any, which from the sounds of it you don't! Sometimes there is just nothing left that you can do besides give up. If a parent has chosen to do so, then it's truly none of your freaking business!|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Catch them on videotape, and prove it.  Maybe you'll get them sent to juvy and you'll never have to deal with them ever again.<br>  <br>  I agree that it's frustrating, but like everyone else has told you, there's not a whole lot you can do, other than getting the police involved.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	I don't really care to be honest, its not my problem its theirs. if they choose to have children then therefore it should be there responsibility to care and discipline their kids.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	there is nothing you can do really. bad parents don't give a crap you just said that so even if you call them a million times it won't matter to them and as for the kids they will end up in jail or worse
ciG5yrgFaa	recieving blankets, onesies, a few stores have a baby health kit that has nail clippers, thermometer and some other helpful things, baby monitor, baby sling/kangaroo pouch, crib sheets, burb towels, bibs (preferrably the ones that velcro around the neck)<br>  <br>  gift cards are great because you can get what you need with them.  we have way more than enough clothes thanks to my mom raiding goodwill ($1 per item, most of the things still had price tags from the disney store, nfl store, gap, etc.) so if we get clothes we're returning them for store credit to get things we need.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	a bumbo (cushy l'il seat for baby)<br>  a boppy (peanut shaped nursing pillow for you)<br>  a baby sling :)<br>  digital thermometer<br>  <br>  This isn't essential obviously, I would also go and smell all of the baby bath products to see what you like and pick some of those :) The same with diaper creams or ointments.

Bw1h5xAcaa	There are different BCBS plans, so we can't answer that, call the customer service number on the back of your card.<br>  <br>  Usually only office visit copays (usually ranges from $10-$30) are demanded at the dest at the time of visit. If there are additional deductibles or copays required they will send you a bill.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Call your insurance and ask what your copay is.  When I had BCBS, I didn't pay anything during my prenatal care.  The only time I payed for an ultrasound was when it wasn't for medical purposes (ie: the 3D ultrasound).  Everything else was for medical purposes though, so it was 100% covered.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	You need to call the insurance company and check - we have BC/BS in Massachusetts - for regular doctor appointments I pay $25.00 for an office visit . . . but all of my prenatal appointments and ultrasounds were 100% covered so I did not even have to pay that!<br>  <br>  You can also ask if the insurance company has any programs - they signed me up for a Healthy Mom / Healthy Baby program, sent me tons of info in the mail, coupons and paid for my parenting classes.<br>  <br>  Congrats and best wishes!|`|xm1NjRqSaa	Not everyone will have the same plan so it wouldn't help you can either call the place your having the US and see it they can find out for you or you can call the # on the back of your card|`|AXEqOEloaa	Mine is 25.00, it usually says on your insurance card what it is.

That is always a tell-tale sign.|`|ruczpWrGaa	check out twoweekwait.com  its helpful.|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	You can get a test done but be patient till a month i.e when you have your period date<br>  <br>  After 4 weeks or having passed your date you can get a pregnancy test done or a blood test done to confirm it<br>  <br>  You have to wait till 4-54 weeks since having conceived and please take good care to keep it so that you have the good news in 4-6 weeks|`|xm1NjRqSaa	Some people say they know right away.

A Blood test can be done 10 days after conception.|`|LyDAVmm6aa	i had symptoms 2 weeks after 'conception' ( 4 weeks pregnant)....nausea, cramping, going to the toilet more often , binge eating all of a sudden........hyperemesis kicked in at 6 weeks right til the end|`|wzXJOSIeaa	At around 6-8 weeks you will begin to notice pregnancy symptoms.|`|Kaudz4Msaa	In my experience, nausea is the first clue.  Bloating and cravings are another.  I remember, I wasn't sure I was pregnant, but I happened to get pregnant just before Christmas, and although I normally love consuming egg nog, mulled wine, etc. over the holidays, this past Christmas I just didn't crave those.  I felt bloated and easily nauseated.  There may be a little abdominal pain, but if it's strong cramps, it may just be PMS.

AA10096832	Depends on what infant car seat you got. They all have maximum for height and weight that is probably printed on the side so take a peek. It's probably somewhere between 20lb and 23lbs.<br>  <br>  There are carseats that are specifically for babies/toddlers more than 20lbs (they all look pretty much like this one: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Graco-Nautilus-Car-Seat-Matrix/dp/B0011URFRE/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=baby-products&qid=1235407475&sr=8-1)." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Graco-Nautilus-Car...</a> True boosters are for kids (you're probably thinking of boosters like this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Graco-Backless-TurboBooster-Seat-Chatter/dp/B000WJK9O6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=baby-products&qid=1235407535&sr=1-1)" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Graco-Backless-Tur...</a><br>  <br>  I know it can be overwhelming with the whole carseat thing. If you are anywhere near a Babies R Us, I really recommend going there. I'm not a superstore fan but they have a good selection and both times I bought carseats, they carried them out to the car first to ensure that the seat would fit in my small car. Very helpful.<br>  <br>  Oh, and remember to keep your baby rear-facing for as long as humanly possible. It's really much safer for them and takes no extra effort on your part.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	My son was about 7 months old.  He had outgrown the weight limit and was fast approaching the height limit.  <br>  You should switch from an infant seat to a convertible seat when you child outgrows the weight or the height reccommendations for the seat.  Our graco infant seat went up to 22 lbs. and 29 inches.  <br>  <br>  We got a convertible seat that can rear and forward face, goes from 5-35 lbs rear facing,  20-50 lbs forward facing, and then converts into a booster seat for 50-100 lbs.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	We had a Graco key fit and the weight limit goes to 30 lbs. He is 9 months now and still with in a few pounds of the infant carrier but he is also 32" long so we put him in a convertible car seat a couple of weeks ago. His feet hung off the end of his infant carrier. =)|`|sv4guUQNaa	My daughter had already hit 20 lbs by her 1st birthday so I moved her to a regular front facing car seat the same week as her birthday.  She's now almost 40 lbs and the car seat is only good up to 40 lbs so I'll have to move her to a booster in a few months.<br>  <br>  Also we got a convertible car seat that changes from rear facing to front facing to booster, but for the amount we paid for it, we could've just gotten three different car seats and saved a little money.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well i moved my daughter up to a toddler car seat when her feet couldn't fit in the rear facing position anymore. by then she was close enough in weight that it was safe to put her in a toddler car seat that was forward facing. i don't remember the age though|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	both 1 year and 20 lbs|`|AA11611165	Infant seat untill they hit 20 pounds and 1 year old...Then 40 pounds they can get into a booster...<br>  There isnt really sizes, i mean, all kinds are differant. Like   I have eddie bouer, and its a big one, my friend as safety first, and it is a little smaller. So there isnt really, sizes of car seats. Its just, Infant, toddler, booster.  Hope it helped...|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Both my kids were 6 months when they moved from an infant seat to a convertible seat. They had to switch because they were too tall. A lot of moms fail to realize their is a height limit on their car seat as well as a weight limit. Having a baby in a seat that they are too tall for is dangerous. The height limit on most infant seats is 28 inches.|`|TZzWGFNMaa	after your baby hits 22lbs or 1yr that's the limit for most infant seats so its time to switch when your baby has hit the max for the infant seat even though you can switch before that but an infant seat is much more convenient though if you switch early make sure the seat is installed properly it still has to be rear facing for the first year and make sure to always use a head rest!|`|7a44936933ba839c97c6dfe7c9f85d0eaa	I think the infant car seats go up to 15-18 lbs. The next size is the one the that is more straight and that one can hold up to 80 lbs.|`|LtuWHvkraa	9 months|`|W8hvEmFlaa	8 months
xm1NjRqSaa	I read that the implantation bleeding can last a few days, And i always thought it was a very light pinkish color. But, Everyone is different.<br>  Ps. You can get preg right before & right after that's why so many people have False Neg. because they got preg. different times then they thought they should have. Both of my boys were conceived within days before the start on my period.
9a3sNrEqaa	sounds VERY normal! for the constipation go to the pharmacy and get Colace-stool softner. Don't get the one with the laxative in it. It works pretty well! its what my dr suggested for me! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!! <br>  <br>  ps...don't worry ur not paranoid ur just a normal mommy 2 be!!!|`|MKnpH4XKaa	Im 7 weeks and that's what im having its normal.<br>  but my nausea isn't that bad has before.|`|QSodlfMraa	had all those too, its normal i am now 22 weeks.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	Those sound perfectly normal!  Just don't stress because that is harder on the baby than almost anything.  Relax!  Good luck and congrats!
5axGfFofaa	I ovulated Fri ( will not be due for AF until March 7 or 8th) so I am currently glued to yahoo answers (hoping someone will randomly put a message on here stating they are psychic and I am pregnant), analyzing every little thing about myself, and thinking about what a possible due date would be (my birthday month)....I am obsessing and need to get over it.  I am reading the last book in the Twilight series so that is helping a lot.  I am also starving so I keep looking at online menus of restaurants near us.  If you can afford it, try and take a mini vacation....Yesterday to pass time I went through all the steps to book a Cruise (did not hit submit).  I am also playing on trip advisor.  These things pass a little time...but then I go back to obsessing over nursery schemes and baby names!  Tonight I am going to the gym to workout.  Then I will be back to obsessing!!!!<br>  Best wishes to all of us!|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I drive myself crazy during the tww! I will be ovulating in a few days and I'm already going mad. I have started in on some home improvement projects to help pass time. Like painting and stuff.<br>  Some tests can tell as early as 10dpo but for a more accurate result its best to wait until 14dpo. Good luck!|`|eytlIKITaa	I'm with you on the TWW!  I'm a bit irregular though, Friday will be CD45 so I'm going to test then...  (Cycles normally 30-47 days)  No sign of AF, so I guess that's a good sign- not sure if I have any pregnancy symptoms though, I've been known to trick myself- so I've learned not to read into anything that much.  I don't think there is anything you can do to not freak out...  I just sit on YA during the week and try to help other hopeful mommies-to-be...<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Baby dust!!!|`|WnlzScIyaa	Oh girl, I don't know what to do!!! I am going to ovulate in the next two days, and I am going crazy already. I think it is because I am trying the instead cups this month! But I CAN"T WAIT. I feel like this is the month  I will finally see my two pink lines!|`|14RzmDTmaa	well i ovulated on the 17th and the earliest i can test is the 27th. it's hard to wait but my husband is trying to keep my busy, plus we are moving. good luck and keep us posted.
pWz8d8MBaa	i have i feeling this doesn't have to do with your period, but the only way we can tell for sure is if these symptoms continue longer than 2 weeks, if thas the case see a Doctor but before then get a pregnancy test because that could be an option... also have you been having any digestive problems this is a sign that these symptoms are a possibility of a wide range of conditions and according to the lower back and thigh aches i think that could be true.|`|VClsjJzGaa	i cramp all the time but i think its do to lactic acid or something like that|`|AI2VoFP4aa	does not sound like pregnancy. alot of people cramp around the time of ovulation and if youre not on birth control then you dont have those hormones to regulate that. ive never known anyone to cramp that was pregnant unless it was ectopic. every dr ive known has said if you have cramping during pregnancy theres probably something wrong and the only first trimester symptoms i know resemble a stomach flu.|`|Y66oUW5qaa	cramps are usually caused by lack of calcium, since you let out a big amount of calcium during menstruation period, and is also largely affected by the level of your hormones.

Fkl6gV8Qaa	Actually they no longer tell you not to bath your baby until the cord falls off. When I said something about it they told me that that was the old way of thinking. I never did give my kids a full bath until they fell off though. There are some powder that are okay and they recommend that you not squeeze it on the baby but in the diaper away from the baby. If you really like powder it does come in a roll on form that is completely safe. Desitin is fine but my pediatrician recommends A&D ointment. Lotions are safe but I would avoid the cord as the more dry it gets the faster it will come off. There are so many out there. I prefer Burt's Bees apricot oil. I actually ended up still buying after my kids grew out of baby lotions to put on myself each day (it smells wonderful and is SO good for your skin).<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you are right no full baths until the chord falls off<br>  when you do start baths you can use any baby was. i used Johnson and johnson from head to toe just because at the time it was easier and smelled so good. <br>  you can use any kind of lotion just try to make sure it's sensitive for baby;s skin.<br>  the DR's tell you not to use powder anymore<br>  and yes you can use desitine|`|ugsfuQQcaa	use the Johnson's head to toe, also the nightime soap will work well in the evenings.  Use Johnson's lotion and definately nix the powder, not good for them.  And sponge bath until the cord is gone.
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	When I was pregnant, I didnt know what I was having so we choose both a girls name and a boys name. Brooke Elizabeth was our pick for a girl! I loved it!... But we had a boy. Brooke Caitlyn is nice but there might too much of the K or C sound going on. But of course I like Brooke Elizabeth better!|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	I think that it is cute but I don't think that it flows too well. I really like Brooke Elizabeth<br>  Brooke Alexandra<br>  Brooke Alexandria<br>  Brooke Emmaline<br>  <br>  I think that those go better with Brooke but that's just my opinion and the best of luck to you and your family! ~I LOVE Derek|`|kLNhAEVpaa	I like it.<br>  Haha, what about Brooke Lynn? Lol!<br>  Or...<br>  Brooke Christine<br>  Brooke Michelle<br>  Brooke Marie<br>  <br>  I think two-syllable middle names go nicely with Brooke, to balance out the number of syllables in the first and last names (for example, Brooke Rose is only two syllables, so I think a two-syllable name would work better if you want the name Brooke.)|`|w0eRRsoVaa	It's cute.  The reason it's hard to find a good middle name is that hard names like Brooke often require really flowy middle names like Evangeline, etc.|`|VHk7ihSdaa	How about Brooke Delaney or Brooke Indigo or Brooke Willow. But then again Brooke Caitlyn sounds good too. I can see your problem with finding a middle name.|`|MdSU0s8Saa	very sweet|`|io3lMQgFaa	The best one to compliment Brooke would have to start with a vowel in my opinion, but if you really love Caitlyn then it's not bad.|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	erm how about Brooke Emelia? Brooke Grace, Brooke Ebony? i like Brooke Ebony the best out of those.|`|Ir0dKh3iaa	Yah it works.....<br>  <br>  Brooke is my middle name!!|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I like it. It's cute.|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	its profect|`|i3GmRK2Qaa	I like it. but spell Caitlyn, Kaitlyn|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Very cute...sounds great.
AA12032374	that is not a stupid question. Yes you can breast feed in whatever position is comfortable for you and baby. If baby doesn't mind you walking around while he/she is feeding, go for it|`|q1Swxe3qaa	You can definately stand up to nurse! I used to walk around the house, cook dinner, or clean while nursing my daughter! it takes some practice, but eventually you get so used to it that you can do anything if you need too!|`|a1x0xqARaa	You can do whatever you need to do while breastfeeding.  Walk around, and such. Just make sure the baby doesn't unlatch or he/she will start cryin on ya!  It's not like it only works sitting down, lol.|`|MMUeOWXUaa	You can go wherever you want, walking, standing, sitting, etc as long as you are comfortable with it!!|`|hVVALFAPaa	If you can comfortably hold her and move around, go for it. <br>  <br>  I don't know how I would have gotten anything done without feeding on the run!|`|JsfSS1o8aa	you can but dont do it when you are swimming or running lol|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	Both.|`|AA10958272	It's a matter of balance & protection & calming/time, no?<br>  <br>  Biologically speaking, your mams are where they are -- and a woman's hair grows long so you CAN stand upright & move with a baby attached if necessary (especially to avoid predators). But.. why would you want to answer the phone, or cook an egg or go pour yourself a cold drink, etc. for the 20-mins. or so it takes for a feeding? It's possible, but so is a baby bjorn loosening for that matter -- which is why you're coddling the infant in the first place, no? It's about the most poignant time of nurturing for a mom/child, so what would be taking precedence of that feeding time? That's my question? Are you doing the bills at the same time? it's NOT a stupid question -- but I don't see why you would want to walk around... you mean, like going-on shopping in a mall vs. having to find a spot to sit?<br>  <br>  You're trying to protect the baby, and keep them calm all the while -- so, you'd think you'd want to shield their eyes from light or make it noiseless, or maintain eye contact if they look at you for reassuring, etc. and not move them as you walk. Are you THAT busy? that you can't stay still?<br>  <br>  P.S. -- Sorry to see the Thumbing Down here, going on.. but what can I say. Most ladies feel this is their area, their purview and don't like reading ANYthing from a man in this regard. So what. I'm a father of 2, contribute around the house & outside at that -- and know what I'm talking about. You have your answer, whether or know the Ladies with Agendas here simply answer you with "yeah sure" or "I agree" or "you go girl" nonsense -- my advice is, because you CAN doesn't mean you SHOULD. <br>  <br>  GL.|`|9ganxm8iaa	AT first you will probably have to sit still until you and baby get use to it and then you can do whatever.  It is an incredible bonding time though and a nice way to relax.  The only times I ever moved around was when I needed to grab the phone or get my 2-year-old out of something :)  Other than that I sat still and took advantage of that sweet precious time that will never come again.|`|Zdj6wmaiaa	No, its not a stupid question at all!  In the beginning, for me at least, it was hard to to get the latch right even when sitting.  After a while though, when you and baby are used to it, you can do it while walking without even having to stop!|`|jEq8iZW6aa	yes you can stand up and breastfeed. They also make these sling things that you just hook on to you and you can breast feed while she/he is in it and your able to move around. I personally havent used one but i've heard alot of good about them.|`|MnzX5quAaa	this is not a supid question, your just a concerned mommy, and yes you can walk around and do what you need to do, they even have devises that allow you to breast feed your baby hands free, <br>  <a href="http://www.mamatoto.org/Default.aspx?tabid=172" rel="nofollow">http://www.mamatoto.org/Default.aspx?tab...</a><br>  check out this link|`|ezljKYqLaa	Sure you can walk around.  I found it kind of hard to do so at first, but the longer you breastfeed the better you get at it.|`|LtuWHvkraa	Yes,but as baby gets heavier  your biceps have to get bigger ,too.<br>  <br>  as the baby gets older he/she may be too squirmy.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	yes you can breastfeed standing up. i would walk around stores breastfeeding and no one ever noticed.|`|TZzWGFNMaa	you can breastfeed and walk and it shouldn't be a problem esp with a sling to keep your baby in...like the ones you find at Babies R us|`|AXEqOEloaa	You can breastfeed standing on your head as long as you are comfortable.|`|c416U2swaa	you can breastfeed in any position that works for you and your baby|`|AI2VoFP4aa	no you can walk around, as long as it isnt upsetting the baby why not?|`|113FoyMFaa	Of course you can|`|eV6MHADQaa	it's more comfortable but the baby will eat my ex wife breast feed everywhere|`|jXtbb11Haa	I do it sometimes, however it can make your arms ache|`|yjyBbVJoaa	yes but its not fun to!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	You can walk, I always did if I needed to grab something or wanted to move.<br>  <br>  You would be amazed at the things you can learn to do while breastfeeding.  I could make a whole sandwhich or a salad with little effort while nursing at the same time.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	i think you can if your boobs are smaller. mine are massive so i have to hold boob while she feeds to prevent smothering her. wish i could get up and walk around. i get bored strapped to the sofa.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, you can nurse standing up.  It's easier to manage if you use a sling (esp. if you need to actually DO something when you get to the kitchen), but you can breastfeed standing ... sitting ... lying down ... standing on your head.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	It is getting harder to do now that my daughter is getting a little bigger. But yes, I can get up and get the phone, or remote control, or a drink etc. without interrupting the feeding.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, you can breastfeed while standing and walking.
eytlIKITaa	It may still be too early to test- I would wait a week if AF still isn't here and test again.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  Lots of baby dust!!!|`|53GH38Qiaa	There's still a possibility. It may be too soon to tell. Wait another week and test again. I have a friend who didn't get a positive until she was 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And sending Baby dust your way!!|`|14RzmDTmaa	wait another week if af don't show up i would test again, it may have still been too early to test. woman vary on the amount of hormone levels at different time of pregnancy. some woman don't have enough pregnancy pregnancy hormone until they are in there 2nd month. so good luck!

LxWYVksSaa	hi there!<br>  i am going through the same thing. Took a pregnancy test this morning at 15dpo and it was negative. i was disappointed but then again i too dont feel ANY symptoms except for mild cramps like my period was coming. I also had a light pinkish/brown stringy discharge around 8dpo which would be normal implantation spotting.<br>  <br>  i really do hope that you get your BFP, sorry couldnt give you more advice but you are in my thoughts ad i hope you get your BFP!!!|`|dGsgzRkFaa	please post what the outcome is.  I had the same thing happen to me.  I don't want to stress whether I'm pregnant or not because that can delay your period too.  Please post your outcome.  Thanks:)|`|28dke1UCaa	oh my goodness. I have the same thing going on. I am a week late and I have been very regular for at least a year. I have taken 3 tests since one day after my missed period, all negative. I have been having cramps that are a little sharper than my normal mestrual cramps. And my boobs are starting to get sore. My husband and I have decided to retest AGAIN in a few days. If I still have no period and keep getting more symptoms and still BFN I think I will go to my gyno. Let me know what happens with you.
Mp9SaP1iaa	When I was on the IUD and Nuvaring I had alot of those and felt that I was pregnant. I found out later that my body could not take any sort of BC<br>  <br>  With my first I didnt know I was pregnant until I started having back pain and I was couple months along I couldnt stand it any more and went to the hospital and thats when I found out I was pregnant<br>  <br>  With my second I had a miscarriage but before I found out I had very bad nausea <br>  <br>  My third got pregnant really quick after the miscarriage and I had nausea off and on dont believe the word morning sickness because it happens whenever morning evening night<br>  <br>  And this one my first sign was tummy twitches, alot of gas and yes diarreah off and on which I thought gas happened later in pregnancy alot of people told me it was nothing but I took a test and later found out I was indeed pregnant 7 wks now<br>  <br>  Best thing you can do is go to your doctor and tell him/her whats going on and see if you can stop taking your BC and wait to find out if you are or not pregnant ask when you can take a blood test to find out or a HPT.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	none of those are signs of pregnancy and not all people get morning sickness that is just a stereotype of pregnancy. i wasnt sick even one day and i didnt start feeling or even looking pregnant until my third trimester.|`|SqDXxAeGaa	the best and weirdest way to do it if your within 2 months of the possiblity of being prego then pee in a cup of bleach if it bubbles then your prego if not then its to early to tell or your not good luck|`|3Ks21ASDaa	Probably just sick. Look up pregnancy symptoms. Buy a test!!!|`|SmWuSrHYaa	I think it would be worth it to buy a test cause then you know for sure. I found out a few weeks ago and I  haven't thrown up yet. Not everyone throws up. I suggest getting a test. I got some at the dollar store to see if they work and it was darker than the expenisve ones I bought.|`|kP3Ryfyuaa	I dont think you are, but the only way to make sure is to wait and take a test.... sorry I wish I could give you the "right" answer but everyones bodies are diffferent.

Good luck.....answer my question!|`|XXKs0tpOaa	i find the most reliable sign is when a baby tries to free itself from your uterus, allthough even at this point i would still reccommend a test to be certain|`|Sz36Xyqtaa	a defanant sign is when a baby falls out of your vagina|`|mEhvkaSfaa	better take a test|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	I dont think it is worth it, considering you are using birth control.

g9vw4ovGaa	Oh my goodness, I truly do hate baby book thumpers!! I was working in a restaurant until i was 37 weeks pregnant, and in the middle of dinner rush, I took off in a fast sprint because I left my money laying on a table. I didn't go into labor, and nothing ever happened. I kind of felt tight like my muscles had a work out or something for a few days. Since you're so far along more than likely you'll be going to the doctor soon, let him/her know what happened. There are women that still jog during pregnancy. If you feel nervous about it, call the advice nurse at your obgyn, she'll tell you what is the best idea. And of course, don't feel bad about doing what any dog lover would do! That doesn't make you a bad mother!|`|LcOPL8gCaa	No one should give you crap for getting your dog. Its like getting your kid. Its fine. Anyways I think you should go to your doctors. And get a check up, there could be some problems, but is your daughter moving like normal? Or is she not moving? If you did speed up the labor i'm sure its fine. Some have their baby's at 35 weeks. Its very normal. Anyways, go to the doctors, make sure everything is fine, and try to avoid running =] i know you couldn't but I'm just saying. I think your okay, but that sprint, was something you haven't done in a while so it could have just tightened everything up a little.<br>  But call your doctor get in and check everything.<br>  <br>  Good luck & best wishes!|`|hVVALFAPaa	My guess is that the jarring caused your baby to drop. That is the feeling you described (locked in tighter)<br>  <br>  First babies can drop up to two weeks before birth. Second or third babies usually do not drop until labor but they still can.<br>  <br>  Since you are 36.5 weeks, you and the baby are good. <br>  <br>  Good luck and stop feeling guilty! Running after your dog is really no different than running after a toddler later!|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	The baby is fine..she has alot of cushion..no worries there. Chances are you didn't increase your chance on labor either...unless you are already dialated or was put on bedrest for fear of going into labor. If you have having no contractions..you are fine.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	I doubt you hurt the baby.  As long as you are not having pain...or spotting of blood...she/he was probably just jiggled around or probably dropped alittle....which could explain the tight feeling you are having.  The only way to be for sure would be to call the dr. and ask.  Usually all dr. offices have a nurse on call that you can speak with.  Call and let her know what happened and if she has any concern they will bring you in to monitor you.  As far as labor, even if you did speed up you coming into labor you will be fine!  Anytime after 36 weeks the baby is fully developed and is perfectly fine to have him/her.  If you were to go into labor today it would be fine, you have pretty much carried your baby to term already!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wTYh7DiSaa	You have 2 days to go before you are considered full term. Relax :)<br>  <br>  And unless you had sudden gush or trickle of clear fluids, more than 5 contractions in an hour, vaginal bleeding etc then you haven't harmed the baby. You only stated that you  ran and did not fall, or4 hurt yourself, so you should be okay. Is your little one still moving as she should? Continue with the fetal kick counts and if you notice something has changed, go to L&D or call your OB.|`|vjoyv5J6aa	My dogs are my kids too. Just take it easy for a while. I'm tired of getting speeches from everyone telling me what to do and not do, blah blah blah. Mostly saying "you don't want to have him early now do you?" Its possible, but your body tells you whats good and not good. Thats what pain is for. Take it easy today, baby's are more active when you're relaxed. It says you can move your belly around to get her up and count movements (all) in ten min... its in that what to expect book. I think its to just check on them.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	i dnt think you can hurt your baby from running i mean it is still protected by the sac  just keep track of the baby movement if you are worried cos dat can help you tell if the baby is ok or not|`|mEhvkaSfaa	ya ya don't worry. everything is fine.|`|MtC3CWZraa	No need to worry. You're probably just a little sore/tight from doing an activity you don't normally do. That's how I feel the day after I put myself on the treadmill since I've been too lazy to do it on a regular basis since I got pregnant.|`|dDVAUA9saa	There is nothing wrong with running.  Many women run until the day they deliver.  Running 100 feet will not hurt you or the baby.
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	No. Give your child their own identity.|`|u7o75zipaa	Yeah, that's pretty cute. <br>  And I love the name Steven :) <br>  I think it's good to give your children a meaningful name. My siblings and I have our first and middle names after people.|`|Elxuvon8aa	steven is okay if you choose a different middle name|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No, no one likes to be a junior.  You could use Steven as a middle name though.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	yup|`|MdSU0s8Saa	if you want<br>  afterall it is partly your choice|`|1Cnaphybaa	if 'steven' is a common name in ur family , then maybe it would be a good idea.its nice to have a name passed down through generation.on the other hand , if ur child ever feels embarrassed about u , they would definitely not like to be named after u.each individual person likes to feel like , a , well , individual ! maybe a different name would give the child a nice boost of self confidence.it is not good to feel plain.whatever you do though is ur choice and u must feel happy with it !|`|8mQVfDRqaa	I wouldn't use Steven as a first name, but maybe a middle name.<br>  <br>  If I was a boy, my middle name was going to be Steven, and Steven is also my dad's name.<br>  <br>  I say use it as a middle name :)<br>  <br>  But the mother may not like it...|`|AXEqOEloaa	I would never name my son after his father and he agrees, but if it is something that is important to you then go for it.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Yes, you shoud if that is what you want. I think it is really cute when a dad names his little fella after him.|`|FsiG5WtQaa	It a really common name and He'd prolly rather have his own name when he gets older.|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	if that what you went it dosent matter what everyone thinks all the time its your decsion|`|n7BuH75gaa	So many Stevens.<br>  I don't care though.<br>  Ask the mom when the times comes, not us. <br>  LOL|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	no., everyone should have their own name.|`|eJMIazhLaa	My opinion, I would say no.  My husband wanted to name our son after him, but he would have been a third.  I put my foot down and said "NO!"  I think that a person should have their own name, be their own person.  It also causes some problems down the road.  My husbands dad had a bunch of stuff on his credit report that was his son's.  Too much trouble.|`|EiN9qdapaa	that would be cool if you named you kid after you as long as you dont use the same middle name some cool names would be:<br>  Steven Caden <br>  Steven Mathew <br>  Steven Ace<br>  you could also use some old family names from either side of the family.|`|C0uMGfCCaa	well steven it is your own choice but personally if it is a girl no. If it is a boy go with the middle name steven but its own name for first. also the mom has to help you decide|`|flWS1h7vaa	I wouldn't put steven as a first name but very well could be used as a middle name like Zachary Steven or if you do decide to use it as a first name Steven Alexander is cute and call him Alex|`|dLYakS7gaa	I really like the name Steven but i think you should call your son something else more original!|`|86vUwqyhaa	yes absolutely. steven is an awesome name.|`|FVkyxQjqaa	No give your child his OWN identity|`|W7ZUz9araa	and jr to the end
AA11987492	Have you thought about switching to paragard?<br>  <br>  I have never had the Mirena, I but I do have the ParaGard I *LOVE* it!<br>  <br>  It is hormone free, so it doesn't mess with your cycle, and you don't get all of those nasty side effects either.<br>  <br>  I did bleed heavier at first with it, but to be honest, unless you are prone to anemia, it really didn't bother me. I just wore an ultra tampon instead of a regular one, no big deal. <br>  <br>  Now, my periods are about the same as they used to be, I will wear an ultra for the first day or maybe two, but after that, I have the same flow and length that I used to.<br>  <br>  I had slight cramping with my first period after it was inserted, (I never used to), but it was nothing that Tylenol couldn't take care of, and now I don't cramp at all.<br>  <br>  Also, My OBGYN said that the strings are much softer and less "wirey" than the Mirena's. I know a lot of people with the Mirena say their partner is always getting poked with the strings, but mine has never had a problem with that.|`|LCryvb7qaa	I feel your pain! I had the Mirena put in during the first period I got after delivering my son. I never had any unusual scattered bleeding or anything, but I felt like I had my period 24/7. I was so crampy all the time and a few times it got so bad I was doubled over for hours and felt as though I was in labor. We were ready to go to the ER but my doctor insisted it was "normal." I'm sorry, but that's no way to go about life every day just because the doctors say it happens to some women and it's normal. I tried it for eight months and decided enough was enough and got it removed. It was pretty much immediate relief and could not even feel them take it out!|`|e0Om6Onqaa	I've heard about a lot of problems with Mirena. Sounds like it's not too rare unfortunately.
S6QpB8QZaa	THe Answer brand OPK were actually my favorite to use although are a bit confusing. I found that the more you open the container the lighter the control line was. The tests still worked.
SEzIkGNiaa	I suggest *not looking online for jobs, as its very dangerous.  What I did was I handed out flyers to neighbors/people I knew with children.  If you don't know anyone with children, you could ask people/or family members if they know anyone that might need a sitter.  On the flyer put:<br>  <br>  Name<br>  Number or Email<br>  Age<br>  Rates<br>  Experience<br>  Availability/Flexibility<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|hJWjSWYXaa	Sittercity.com you sign up and fill out all the info and you can search for jobs and parents can  find you great site I'm a nanny as well|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	on criagslist, did you look for jobs or post something?
uFSDEo9Uaa	<a href="http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/" rel="nofollow">http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/</a> is a new approach on quitting for free.<br>  This site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking.<br>  <br>  It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you, and it's free.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I am a smoker, and all I can really say is, if you really truly wanted to QUIT, I mean honestly wanted to,   you would.  No excuses, nothing.|`|SDnhUMv9aa	Okay, so you know that smoking is bad for you. You know that it CAN kill you and you know it can kill your baby. It's going to be hard but just think how much better you will feel when you have stopped. It's not just you anymore its you and your child and you need to protect him from everything you can. You need to give up for the sake of your son and for an all round better health. Its better to quit cold turkey as the nicotine in your blood level will be completely gone in a few days as oppose to refilling it and needing cigarettes more often. You say you are not addicted, its still going to be hard but you haven't got into the daily habbit yet. You seem to just go for the cigarettes when you are feeling down. Why not choose a subsitute for the smoking? Obviosly I wouldn't turn to something like alcohol. Maybe when you feel bad you could go and spend some time playing with your son? As for your boyfriends brother I would just stay away from him for now. Hes just going to start the cravings if he smokes around you. <br>  I hope this helps and good luck! xx|`|eytlIKITaa	I understand your parents stressing you out- I'm dealing with a lot of rubbish with my parents as well.  I used the patch to help me quit along with the knowledge that my husband and I are ttc and I wouldn't subject our unborn baby to that.  Today is day 52 for me!  You just need to have the want and the drive to quit!  It's hard, I know, but totally worth it!|`|AA11705909	I gave up by attending a smoking cessation group at my health centre.<br>  It was run by the practice nurses there. They will tell you just how smoking affects you and start you on a regime of patches on gum.<br>  The others in the group will help you along, peer group pressure is a wonderful thing.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Biggest thing for me is don't quit for anyone else but yourself. Quitting for someone else is hard and stressful.|`|MdSU0s8Saa	go on the nhs website where you'll find loads of helpful stuff to stop and there might be stop smoking packs in pharmacies near you|`|nY1nq9hCaa	Will power with patches.  <br>  <br>  It is best doing it know, stats show that children who smoke is a result of family members who smoke.  It is a habit that should not be passed on.  You have to tell yourself why you have to quit and what caused it in the first place and that it has done nothing to help by doing it.  It is easy getting hypnosis but in the end its you that has to learn to beat it so that you can cope if it returns.<br>  <br>  Your family problems should be dealt with in a different way from smoking.  That does not mean eating lol|`|TrBoPj92aa	Awwh Jacey i feel really sorry for you  about your parents, thats tough my dad left my mum when i was 15 its hard but the pain does go away.<br>  <br>  Great, you haven't been smoking too long so it won't be too hard to quit, remember cravings only last for a very short time 30secs or so so when you feel one coming on just think about different things like where your children are.<br>  <br>  When you feel upset and stressed out do something to make your children happy not to hard, tickle them or play with them and when you see them smile and hug you you'll feel much better and happy.<br>  <br>  Stay away from your boyfriends brother, he will try and temp you or you will want to smoke being around him.<br>  <br>  Remember the reasons you want to quit  <br>  - you want to stay with your children for longer as you want to see you grandkids grow up too!<br>  - you want your kids to stay as healthy as possible remember although you don't smoke around them which is very good, they can still smell it on your clothes and in the long run it will damage their health as well as yours<br>  - you want to keep fit, no point taking your kids to the park in 5 years time and you can't keep up with them - boys can be pretty fast<br>  - kids can feel embarassed when they are older with smoking parents<br>  -you don't want them too smoke<br>  - you decrease your chances of having another child if you want them to have a sibling then quit!<br>  <br>  try really hard with WILLPOWER and if you don't manage to quit then<br>  talk to your doctor he will offer help to you <br>  you sound like a great mum so keep going good luck jacey =)  x|`|sgMno1PRaa	I no its difficult - But i just quitted and that was it. I had my last one, woke up the next day and didnt smoke. You need to clear your mind and change your attitude. Keep thinking to yourself, Ive got control of my body Im the one in charge and no addiction is going to control me anymore. Its all about will power.<br>  Like people who are anorexic have a voice saying dont eat, even when there body is so hungry for it.<br>  So you need to be that voice and do it.<br>  Have the control and power and take charge!!<br>  Be strong - Dont be weak!|`|MPCfQuT5aa	If you really want to quit then just stop. I have known many heavy smokers and the ones who succeeded in stopping where those who went cold turkey, no patches, gum or any other aid. They just stopped and never started again. If you find yourself making excuses, like 'I'm addicted' or 'I don't want to put on weight' then you are probably not ready to give up and it would be a waste of time trying.<br>  Good luck|`|Og3vKQeWaa	it`s difficult Jacey, the only advice I can give, is to eat something, that make the cig taste bad! I was eating apples and drinking apple juice, to try and make them less appealing, but still took me 4 years too quit!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Talk to your doctor or a doctor or even a local hospital.They will point you in the right direction.Maybe even a pill that helps you stop smoking.|`|ZKw46efXaa	jesus if you are not 'too addicted' then bloody well give up! its been 53 days for me and i was a very heavy smoker for 10 years so if i can do it you can!!|`|6J6S6ECoaa	Go to your doctor and explain your situation . He/she will certainly put you in touch with a Stop Smoking Clinic and with help of those in the same boat you will certainly be able to stop . You can get patches or chewing gum to relieve the withdrawal symptoms . I think you need help with your relationships with your parents and here again the Doctor can refer you to the correct person. You ca stop smoking and after you do you will never again worry about a cough and wonder if it is lung cancer . Good reason ?  Best of luck .|`|562qoBUUaa	Just stop smoking. Quit making excuses for why you smoke and are stressed out. Find another, healthier outlet. Exercise or something like that. Do it for your health so you can be there for your kids longer. Get on the patch, the gum, or just stop cold turkey. Make up your mind and do it!!!!|`|xocIN0scaa	Good for you for making the right choice to seek help to stop!!!<br>  Try leaving reminders for yourself around the house...A picture of your baby on the back door so if you go outside to smoke you can see why you are trying to stop.. think about the $ you will save and what you can buy instead.. maybe a nice trip to Disney with your adorable baby :)|`|VqN3xV1uaa	Don't worry about it. You haven't been smoking for very long, and with the stress you are under, I'm sure it helps. And kids don't mind smoke - the more they are exposed to, the stronger they will be. I have 3 young daughters, and they all love to smoke.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	By not smoking around your children, you're only teaching them, it's ok to sneak around. When they get older, they will only sneak around on you, because that's what they are learning.|`|izbQoi33aa	Hypnotherapy hun. Costs around ￡40.<br>  I used to smoke 30 a day. Got hypnotized. Havn't had a cigarette for 3 years.|`|AA11163869	Eat a pomfret cake before every cigarette , it`s as simple as that.
wemgrzjwaa	At 14 months, she should be sleeping through the whole night! Is she napping allot in the day time? If so, you have to break her out of it. I had that problem with my son and the doctor told me to try and wake him up whenever he fell asleep, try and keep her really busy throughout the day, and at night right before bed time, give her a nice soothing bath, make sure to put water on her face a couple of times, but focusing on the eyes only because the nice warm water makes their eyes feel heavy and make them want to fall asleep. (make sure water doesn't go in the baby's nose or mouth or the baby could choke!)<br>  I hope this helps, I did it with my son and it worked like a charm :)|`|ZVCm3XAEaa	I went through the same thing with my daughter and it is not an easy thing to stop but worth the hardship. She would go down in her own bed at 8 (after falling asleep on either me or my husband), wake at 9 cry until lifted and would only sleep again if with us and this could take hours. In the end, for the good of our relationship, when she woke I would just go into the room and lay her back down and then sit in the room, not holding her, not talking to her, just settling her back into bed every time she got up. I ended up sleeping on the floor of her room until she got the message that I was not going to lift her, talk to her, feed her or anything else. It was a fortnight of screaming from her and tears from me but well worth it. She now goes down at 7.30pm and don't hear from her again until 7am. Good luck and stick with it.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Stop ALL day time naps.|`|wcDStct2aa	I am having that problem at the moment my daughter is 11 months and has not slept through the night in 4 months and god aren't i tired. I have tried everything on the internet i went to the doctors today and she lent us a book in the art of control crying it does sound mean and frightening but  would you rather a couple of nights crying or restless sleep forever i am trying it as i speak and am having no problems. The key is for a relaxed bedtime routine. It is very difficult and i am dreading the crying but you need to find the right cry knowing when she is distressed or just after attention. I have spoken to many people and everyone i have spoken to says it works within a week some quicker than others.
PTdy6TWRaa	I've heard stories about that one getting recalled in 2007. Since then some users complain that it's a bit flimsy and prone to breakage. It has a very low weight capacity and may be tippy - tends to lean forwards but I find many buggies of that style will do that.<br>  <br>  I tried to find out more on the recall and found this link for you where other moms were discussing their experiences, pros and cons of that buggy:<br>  <a href="http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/1012/384696" rel="nofollow">http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/1012/384696</a>
vBR9nB81aa	You need to call your OB/GYN and let them know you are having oral surgery done. Ask them what can be done and how it can be done. He/she will more than likely give you a doctors note for your oral surgeon stating the meds you can take and all that. I had 4 root canals during my course of pregnancy, and everything was fine for me. I know this is different then pulling teeth, but also similar as I was given all different meds and had X-rays taken and such. Good luck!|`|AXEqOEloaa	Wow 15? Yikes!  I know my doctor would not do such extensive work during pregnancy. If you can wait that would be better, but you need to call your doc and see what they suggest.|`|GfG6wupTaa	Are you crazy!!! Have it done after you have the baby.|`|mEhvkaSfaa	no they will not do it|`|QMxEjCpiaa	wow 15 teeth, thats a lot of teeth! I would let your dentist/oral surgeon know about you being pregnant. They can either recommend you have the procedure done after the pregnancy or using another medication. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|i8Ch743Laa	Not typically,call the oral surgeon,they may not want you to. I luckily had all that taken care of before I was pregnant. I have 32 dentures.|`|AA11612508	wow! 15 teeth. i would say thats a toss up isnt it horrible to get dental done during the pregnancy. especially such a big oral operation 15 teeth!!! omg.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	No..they will not do it! The only way they will extract teeth while pregnant is with a release from your doctor and only if it is medically within reason...like an infected tooth or something.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	I don't see why they wouldn't....but you should probably tell them just in case|`|kUCVLuTPaa	the surgeon may not want you too and also u probably dont want to because the pain will be worse since you're pregnant
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Early detection tests even vary in the amount of hormone they detect. Could you be pregnant? Sure. Time will tell. Some women bleed after they are pregnant, so it's possible. How likely? I don't know. I like first response tests, they cost more, but are reliable. But even a negative on one of these doesn't always mean it's negative. <br>  Take it first thing in the morning to have the most concentrated hormone in your urine, but also, be aware that tests are always more accurate the longer you wait after your missed period. These tests are more accurate, but by no means fully accurate. If you are really concerned then make an appointment with your ob/gyn or nurse midwife ASAP.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	obviously u know you're possibly pregnant..so go get a test|`|7ObD9tNbaa	well for me i started getting tired right away, a few cramps, and ate 24/7 .. wait another week and a half, then test Again, always test in the morning, that's when hormones can be recognized the quickest, good luck, email me if you need any advice!|`|PGiOSIBkaa	It wouldn't matter if it was early detection.  Anytime after your missed period, it's pretty darn accurate!|`|F3BRG72iaa	well if your period is normal and you had spotting then there is a chance that you may be pregnant...a friend of mine actually had to take about 7 tests and only one came out positive so keep on testing|`|e0Om6Onqaa	Take an early detection test then, duh.|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	If you cant conclude with the pregnancy testers then get a blood sample test for pregnancy done to get out of this situation<br>  <br>  It is accurate and simple like blood sugar test <br>  <br>  <br>  The Blood Test<br>  Pregnancy blood tests are performed at your doctor's office or health clinic. They detect pregnancy by measuring hCG levels in your blood. There are actually two types of pregnancy blood tests:<br>  <br>  Quantitative Blood Test: The quantitative blood test detects pregnancy by measuring the exact amount of hCG in your bloodstream. It can also be used to detect how far along you are in your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Qualitative Blood Test: The qualitative blood test detects pregnancy by indicating the presence of hCG in your blood. It does not measure your hCG levels, and only provides a yes or no answer as to whether or not you are pregnant.|`|xm1NjRqSaa	Some people experience implantation bleeding and cramping, But it is usually very light. That could be what you were experiencing. You really only have 2 choices wait a week or 2 take another home test or call your Dr. and see if they will let you take a blood test now.|`|V7xgMAzcaa	Hiya.<br>  If you have taken a test and its negative, its possible you tested a bit early?. If you still don't get a period in a few days i would either take another test or go and have a chat with your doc. Hope this helps<br>  Good luck!|`|xEI2wR4Daa	Hmmmm Missed period--- Have you had sex lately?? Are you throwing up in the morning?? Are you using the bathroom a lot??  These are signs that you might be pregnant. Take another pregnancy test|`|SmWuSrHYaa	If you missed your period then you wouldn't need an early detection test. I would go to your dr and see what they say. They will test you too|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	have another one done in a few days time
Nqp4zjGSaa	pray hard that's the only way. You can't determine the sex of your baby anyways, your husband does, and he can't control that either.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Have sex right on your ovulation and it should be a boy.  Normally, a girl is conceived a few days before ovulation begins.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	We tried everything to have a girl because we had a boy already. Now we have two boys LOL and I'm 24 weeks pregnant with a girl. There is absolutely nothing you can do to help your body get a specific gender. you get what you get! Sorry hun.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	There is nothing you can do to produce a baby boy, it is all in God's plan. If you want a boy, you'll end up with a girl, if you want a girl, you'll end up with a boy. Thats just God's way of saying "hey, i'm the one in charge here."|`|klrQ9yFlaa	Have sex the day of ovulation or the day after because the male sperm swims faster and dies quicker so your chances for a boy would be good then.
miPubuDYaa	Why are you scared? Every women who delivers either by c-section or naturally will have a 6 weeks appointment<br>  <br>  You doctor will look at you incesion and your cervix and tell you if you can start having sex again. If he hasnt already removed the stitches he will do that today. He will also discuse a BC plan if you choose that route.<br>  <br>  I had a c-section 7 years old with my first i had a 1 week post op appointment to remove my stitches and a 6 week appointment to make sure i was healing properly.|`|HUQQzph2aa	Not much will happen at the 6 week check up. The doctor will  take the staples out and make sure your are healing properly.|`|xm1NjRqSaa	There is nothing to be scared of. They will just check your incision to make sure it is healing right,They will push on your belly to make sure your Uterus has gone back to Norm. size and then they will prob. do a Vaginal exam to make sure everything is okay on the inside ( It doesn't hurt) Then they will ask you how everything is going and if your feeling okay.   Hey you might enjoy getting out of the house for a little bit !|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	nothing much just check that you are healing properly and dat dere is no infection and your womb is contracting well dats all
JOVWBOOCaa	I would say to do it once in awhile is absolutely normal but doing it all the time is something I might be concerned with. I would definitely bring it up at her next appointment with the pediatrician. I assure you no question is too weird for them, I have asked some questions where I feel like the dr will think I am absolutely nuts but he ends up knowing exactly what I am talking about and has a good explanation or able to refer me to someone who can help. Good luck!|`|Jswomud7aa	My son is about 14 months and is pretty much the same way. He "allows" me to hold him and when I want a hug I have to steal it, he doensn't give out freebies! <br>  <br>  He, also, has recently discovered he can scream and he screams just for the sake of screaming. As a mother, we all can distinguish between the "i just want attention," the "I'm REALLY hurt, the "I'm tired," or the "I'm hungry" cry and when he screams I believe he just does it to hear himself. It's so high pitched when he screamed I was amazed he could reach those notes! But I honestly don't think it's a big deal. <br>  <br>  My daughter and him get into screaming competitions (let me tell you how fun that is for ME! lol) and then laugh when their done, it's entertaining for them. <br>  <br>  I've recently started teaching my son to give kisses. I don't know if you have done this with your daughter, but I try to get his attention when he's facing me on my lap. It's kind of hard to actually get him to face me straight on because he's constantly looking side to side, but once he does I say "kisses" really clearly and pucker. He looks at me with a smile then I lean forward and give him a kiss. It becomes a little game and he tries to pucker his lips and give a kiss after I say "kisses" again. I've only been able to get this to last maybe a total of 60 seconds, but I think it helps.<br>  <br>  Some kids are not overly affectionate and don't like the feeling of confinement when they're cuddled. I wouldn't worry too much about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	The CNS-central nervous system isn't mature in anybody until ages 6-7 sometimes 10.  She certainly has tactile defensiveness, possibly sensory integration disorder.  This can stand alone, but does frequently accompany autistic spectrum disorders.<br>  <br>  The important thing is to have early intervention evaluate her, its free you need no referral.  A good OT can start a sensory diet.  <br>  <br>  Based on the tactile defensiveness, I'd start with the Wilbarger brushing protocol 4-6x/day.  The brushes we get ours from <a href="http://www.superduperinc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.superduperinc.com</a><br>  they are called webber brushes<br>  <br>  Get "Sensory Defensiveness in children aged 2-12, an intervention for parents and other caretakers" book by OT's Julia and Patricia Wilbarger<br>  <br>  Things I found helpful:<br>  Hug from the back her back to your chest, and be firm, they like deep pressure, anything else feels ticklish<br>  <br>  squish her with deep steady pressure with a pillow while she is lying on the floor|`|At7WLduQaa	i dont think thats normal, From what I have seen infants always want to be hugged and attached to there mother in some way, otherwise they cry, but an infant that doesnt like to be touched is kinda of wierd, she must have a wierd impressinon of you or something, DO you smell|`|f7PlvV4Baa	No that's not normal but i wouldn't assume the worst quite yet. give her some time.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	thats how i am and im 27. according to my mom ive always been that way. some people jsut dont like to be touched.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i saw normal when my little girl get hurts she runs and hids SAD HUH Plus at this age they are so wiggly lol <br>  ask your dr but assume the best|`|AA11247439	because  say u have another child with autism,  and the fact that there is a genetic component to autism it sounds like she could be on the spectrum.     Asperger's syndrome is a mild form of autism that does not involve any language delay (though sometimes there can be a slight delay but not any clinically significat delay.     Or she could just have sensory proccesing disorder    with only has to do with sensory issues and no communication issues at all.    Whatever the outcome is i suggest you get her evaluated by developmental pediatritian who is knowledgeable about the autistic spectrum and sensory issues.  Most doctors who are knoledgable about the whole autistic spectrum will be knowlegdable about sensory issues but not all.

My son did that to but not to that extent.   Turned out he has a severe dry skin problem.  He was very uncomfortable.  I used baby Aveeno lotion and hes been fine ever since.    If it isn't a skin problem, then it could very well be a faze she might grow out of.   <br>    I am assuming your the mother, did you have depression during or after your pregnancy?    My mother had severe depression during and after her pregnancy with me, and when I was an infant I never wanted to be held.    Babies are sensitive to your mood.<br>      It could be a number of things.   If you are really worried about it, speak to you pediatrician.|`|agcSrV75aa	its not normal, the worst case scenario would be that someone has been touching her inappropriately. but don't worry yet, give a while and if shes still acting the same i suggest you try taking her to a child psychiatrist before it gets any worse<br>  <br>  good luck, i hope it all works out|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	She could be on the autism spectrum, but  maybe she is on the high functioning end of the spectrum. Asperger's disorder might be a good place to start. It seems like if you already have one child with Autism you and your  child's doctor's should know what to watch for.|`|ISCewF75aa	every child is different.  I have twins and one of them is like that and they were both raised the same.  I find if I don't force her and let her do her own thing, then she will come to me when she's sleepy and sit on my lap and snuggle but still doens't like tight embraces.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Tell your doctor on her next checkup. It could be in the autism spectrum but a slightly different form than your other child. Not all autistic children have the same symptoms nor do the symptoms show up at the same time.<br>  <br>  Or she could just be overly sensitive to touch. How does she react to different-feeling objects? Hot/cold; soft/hard; scratchy/fluffy.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Since you already have a child with Autism I'd definitely bring this concern to your child's doctor.  It could be nothing...but only your doctor can tell you for sure.  Good luck.  I hope this helps.
miPubuDYaa	Yes. you can get pregnant on BC however its uncomman about 3% chance. Though the first month starting BC you need to use backup protection because your body hasn't yet got adjusted to the pill yet.<br>  <br>  The pill might be making you feel this way. Did you get your period last week? if not take a pregnancy test. If you did than you should be ok.|`|0hSpsSByaa	Yes, you could especially that soon after starting.  It takes a while for them to be fully effective.  Even if you had been taking them for some time, the pill is only 99% effective, so there is still a chance you can get pregnant.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yes, and the pill is not in your system properly for the first month or 2, id take a test today if i was you....|`|ZckxI1M5aa	yes definitely possible. I got pregant on birth control but it ended in an MC. I'd suggest taking a test and then seeing your gyn right away if you are.|`|sAbah6dTaa	yes you can always get pregnant. <br>  my sister in law was on three different kinds of bc when she got pregnant three different times. good luck!|`|AA11612508	happened to a friends of mine.|`|mlFaQ1LPaa	a slim chance but still possible if did ejaculated inside. u need to know when is ur exact ovulation day and if the day u had sex without ovulation, the chances are slim. u need to be protected all time. u can take HPT test 3 weeks after unprotected sex or the 1st day u missed a period. hope it helps^^|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Yes, its very possible. But the first couple months, you will feel sick. Its just the pill kicking in, a lot of women have made the mistake of thinking they were pregnant. But its prob a possibility. It takes at least 3 months before the pill actually works. So that means you could be prengant. But ya, go to the doctors, take a test.<br>  <br>  Good luck & best wishes!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Yes, especially the first week. You are supposed to take a back up method of birth control the first week you are using them while your body adapts. If you miss a period, test right away. Its very possible in your case!|`|AI2VoFP4aa	yes. its not 100 percent and if you skip a pill you definitely will get pregnant. you should find out before you take any more it could hurt the baby to continue taking them.|`|xT4pJ56maa	I got pregnant while on the shot and then on the pill. Sadly I lost both babies. But the only way to know for sure is to take a test|`|4f0f1d9b8b5e1fa34b0d8964dfda912daa	yes it is entirely possible - get a test asap|`|H2DP8pVDaa	take a pregnancy test ?

XnmFz3Pqaa	Even though you don't remember having unprotected sex SOMETIMES, once in a blue moon, a condom will have a leakage which CAN result in pregnancy.  If you have missed your period already then a pregnancy test should show you are or are not pregnant by now.  <br>  <br>  You could also very well just be sick.  Horrible taste in your mouth isn't really a sign of pregnancy...and you wouldn't really feel anything in your tummy yet.  You could very well have a virus and its making you nausiated.  The feeling in your tummy could be you either being paranoid or just your sickness in general.  Craving food probably comes from the sick feeling you are having because you are probably not eating as much as usual.  And if you do have some type of virus that can DELAY your period.<br>  <br>  Really it all depends on exactly how late your period is.  One way to really tell is to buy a pregnancy test.  You can go to the dollar store and get a cheap one.  They are just as accurate as the ones from Walmart.  ...except for the ones that are made to detect up to 5 days BEFORE your missed period!  Those of course, would be different.  Anyway, take a test...if it comes back negative just give your period time!  By the end of the month...or in 2 wks or so, if you haven't had it again, take another test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uuHPneEcaa	u could be pregnant. just take a test, if u have already missed ur period. <br>  <br>  I took my test when I was 5 days late and it came out possitive. <br>  my symptoms where hungry all the time, frequent urination, tenderness in both breast, and tired. I also had implatation bleeding 2 weeks before my period was due.<br>  <br>  but if ur feeling something moving in ur tummy then u may not be pregnant. Cause u wouldn't be that far alone.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	well if you havent had sex.......<br>  <br>  but if you might have, then take a pregnancy test|`|mlFaQ1LPaa	first of all, do u have the symptoms that are same with the time before ur period is coming?how long do u miss a period? u can take a HPT test 3 weeks later after unprotected sex or a day missed a period. if it cames negative, u might be stressing on ur period arriving or not. stressing is very common for girls that DELAY or MISS a period. take it easy all the time and relax urself.. good luck ^^|`|MKnpH4XKaa	hmmm seems odd if you don't remember having unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  sounds to me your pregnant but it can be something else who knows.<br>  <br>  but take a home pregnancy test that's the only way that you can see if your pregnant.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	youre probably ill. these are not really symptoms of pregnancy. you dont feel anything in your stomach for months.|`|12xWe38aaa	you are pregnant because you are having morring sickens but if you see you belly getting bigger don/t get scared just tell your mum puls how old are you because that is the most inportent thing ok from angel wallace age 13|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	better safe dan sry just have a test done at least then you will know if it is pregnancy or just sickness|`|mEhvkaSfaa	may be better check take a test. all the best
Nux5S6oVaa	It is likely. Sounds just like how it happened to me...only I didn't wait until AF was due...I tested 4 days before and got a faint + and then on my AF day...and got a PREGNANT.<br>  <br>  I would test and see...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	I just asked the same question,but my period is due march 1st,6 days from now....ive had cramping for a week,my boobs hurt and just now i noticed mucous on my undies and when i wiped it,it looked a veryyyyyyyyyy light brown,like light spotting,i usually dont get this|`|ViR6BXiyaa	I would do a test if you are 3 days late, its the only way to know for sure.  Good Luck xx
3K7ffKn2aa	yes that would mean that they are both BO. The only blood type that can't produce an O is AB.|`|sAbah6dTaa	i really don't think so.|`|8sJQP3Y4aa	The child would either be "B" or "O".  Check out this website, you can play with different blood type variations.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	No, one parent has to be O whether they are positive or not, and the other would have to  be a negative, whether they be O or not. There  is no way that O can be produnced out of any other blood type than O.
miPubuDYaa	YES! I stop taking the pill July 1st, after taking the pill regularly for 3 years. My first period off the pill was July 31. I concieved Aug 12 - 15. <br>  <br>  Sometimes coming off the pills makes you more fertile though sometimes it gives you a hard time.<br>  <br>  Have sex 10 -15 days after the first day of your period for the best chance to concieve.|`|vue9NOhYaa	How recently is 'just'?  If you mean a couple of days ago, probably not.  You need time to start ovulating again.<br>  <br>  If you mean a couple of weeks ago or more, yes, you could get pregnant IF you ovulate this soon. (And most women do ovulate within a few weeks of stopping the pill.) <br>  <br>  But try to relax.  If you're this anxious this quickly, you're going to get frustrated very quickly.  Even if everything is *perfect* you only have about a 25% chance of getting pregnant any single cycle, so it can easily take 4-6 months or more to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  EDIT: 3 days after your last pill, your body thinks you are still on the blank pills -- you're probably still having your bleed. (Or haven't started yet.)    Be patient.  You will get pregnant, but probably not today.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	In my case, it's been almost 3 months since I stopped taking BCP, but still no period - or baby.  I went to the Dr.'s 2 weeks ago and got a negative blood test.  It just depends on the woman.  Good luck, and baby dust to you!|`|SmWuSrHYaa	Sure. I got pregnant after being off bc only a month or two. Good luck!
dbafItLvaa	I have heard of women being two months along before their test came up positive.  Call your doctor, and they should be able to get you in for a blood test which will determine definitively whether or not you are pregnant.  Good luck!|`|uuHPneEcaa	u should go to the doctor, if u still think ur pregnant. Cause they can check all ur levels and all that other stuff.That is all I can say. Or ur just about to start ur period. cause some symptoms are the same as pregnancy.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	You need to wait at least until after your missed period as other wise the pregnancy hormone isnt strong enough to detect.<br>  The problem with the early detecting tests if you read on the back is that they are not as effective the earlier you take them so you could be pregnant but the test is weird.<br>  I think by at least one week after your period is due you will know for sure and if not, blood test at docs is best way for certain.|`|SmWuSrHYaa	Have you missed your period yet? If you have and you got a neg result then I would think that you prolly aren't. But if you haven't missed it you could still be pregnant.|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	When is your period due?  Maybe it's too early for the HPT to detect the HCG.<br>  Good Luck to you!
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	My youngest turned 1 yesterday and we started him on whole milk at 11 months old.  It was supposed to be a slow transition but he preferred the cow's milk and didn't want anything else.  He quit spitting up altogether and actually seems to digest it better.  <br>  As long as she's eating well and getting all of the nutrients she needs and tolerates the milk well, I don't think it's a problem.  There's nothing magical that happens on their first birthday and cow's milk is better than the melamine risk (IMO).|`|CdTe8MO4aa	my nephew was 10 months when he was drinking vitamin d milk(whole milk) and eating regular food|`|vBR9nB81aa	They make a next step formula. Its an inbetween type formula for babies over 9months old. The step over baby formula but under cows milk. It is recomended not to give cows milk before age 1 because babies cannot properly digest it. I do not suggest giving your little one the milk until this age because of it. I would try switching to formula. I know its only for a month but ask your pediatrician for sure.|`|4hzUOmEOaa	I think it would be a okay to put your baby on milk.. because my son started to drink milk 11months and he is doing wonderful!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	put her onto a toddler formula, my 15month old is still on formula|`|94106f122aa0859301482207e00eda9caa	It's really not a good idea. For one thing, you increase her risk of allergies to milk and dairy, for another - she's not able to properly digest it. Cow's milk doesn't have everything a baby of 11 mos needs for proper growth and development. I was very careful with my kids, breastfed and everything and 2 of my kids have allergies to dairy - it isn't fun. It's nothing you want to risk if you can prevent it.<br>  <br>  I would recommend putting her on a hypoallergenic or soy formula for a month or two and then switching. There is even a formula for babies 9-24 mos of age because it gives them more than regular milk. Might be worth checking into. Good Luck!!|`|kf1PWDb8aa	I stopped breastfeeding at 11 months and use formula for a month or so. I kept all or the formula coupons and would use them for the last month. I bought the formula for 9-24month old babies.|`|c416U2swaa	Quit giving her any baby food and just do nothing but breast feed for a couple days and that could help bring up your supply|`|SxHvknWMaa	Breastmilk and/or formula for children under 1 year.
j2mRop0laa	Awww Texas. My kids are in school and between homework, after school activities and clubs and them wanting to be with their friends (either here or there).. I'm lucky to get an hour and a half a day on weekdays.. but about 4 hours per day on weekends. I had a little breakdown last night and cried because I feel like my girls are breaking away from me so much, with my daughter going to middle school next year and my youngest requesting more lessons (singing and guitar). I have vowed that starting today they will and I will spend more time together when they get home.. no matter how much I have to move things around.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	My kids are 8 and 10.....we don't get a lot of play time anymore, but last week I spent some time with each of them separately while they read to me from a favorite book.  Also recently I had a spa day with my 8 year old daughter and we painted each other's nails etc.  I have to admit sometimes it is harder to come up with things to do with my 10 year old son, but I feel like we have some pretty good discussions.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i try to play with my son, but soon as i sit to play, he will watch then get up and go play in the pots and pans or go sit in the chairs and look out the window. we roll the ball some times but then he gets bored within a min. so i dunno what to do lol. but when its not to cold we go outside and play for 15 mins at time and come inside and get warm and he will take a nap or eat or something then we go back out. as in playin he just wont play|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Ditto here, although it is much harder since I have a newborn. But I try my best to give my daughter all the undivided attention when her brother isn't on the boobies.<br>  <br>  <<<<<Still very grumpy without my picture!|`|dDVAUA9saa	I work full-time M-F (yes, I'm a mommy who is going to rot in hell, I can deal with that thanks) but during the week she gets at least one hour of my undivided attention.  She is also with me in the kitchen while I make dinner and clean up.  She likes to "wash dishes for mommy and daddy" (read: play in a sinkfull of water and make a giant mess) so she hangs out with me in the kitchen when I'm in there.  Or she sits at the table and has a snack while I make dinner.  But I'm not counting that in her hour of undivided attention.<br>  <br>  On week-ends she has about 6 hours each day of my undivivided attenton.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I work full-time, so during the week, although my time after work is his, it isnt always "play time" but we do have fun doing everything.<br>  Generally a day after work for me is picking him up and if it is unusally nice I will make a stop at the park first to push him in the swing for the last 20 minutes of daylight..or going straigh home and spending the first 30 minutes acting goofy with him, and then it becomes time for dinner to get started then time to eat, then bath, then pajamas, relaxing/playing, then bottle and bed.<br>  During the weekend tthough, we spend alot of time playing. Like 3-4 hours lol..overcompensate|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I work, but am off at about 2 pm so I have plenty of interactive time to give my son.  I also see him on my lunch break and we play for about 20 minutes each day.  I would say that he gets about 2-3 hours a day.  On the weekends however, it is in overdrive and he is with me all day/night constantly getting attention.  He follows me around (sometimes so close if I turn too fast it knocks him down).  Although some days he may not get quite that much mommy time.|`|AA12145826	Thumbs down, Lanie, Johnny's Mommy and I are apparently all going to hell in one giant velvet trimmed hand basket for this, but I too am a "working mother"....though not today. Today I'm a stay-at-home-with-a-sick-child-mother. During the work week I try to give her a good 45mins, but between coming home at 6pm, doing her homework with her (not included in that play time), making dinner, eating, doing dishes (you're looking at the dishwasher....maybe I should change my name to "Whirlpool"?), giving her a bath, and getting her into bed by 8pm, some days I don't get to. On those days she's usually playing with her dad. We try, really we do. So on the weekends she pretty much gets me for a whole day, if not 2 whole days. We go out to places as a family (zoo, museums, etc), we read books, play outside, put puzzles together, play board games or video games (I'm getting pretty good at her V-Smile games...teehee), or sometimes we snuggle up with our pj's a popcorn & just watch a movie.|`|2fB383F2aa	My daughter gets at least 2 hours a day, but not straight. Her attention span is too short for that! We can be playing with play-doh, and she'll just up and leave me and colour in her books, and when I join her, she'll just put on her music toy and run around the living room lol.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	My daughter is 19 months old and out of the 11-12 hours shes awake I am physically and actively playing with her atleast 5 hours sometimes more if it's nice outside.  She does like to play solo but than get bored and wants me to play too which is fine.|`|nzY94B7waa	It depends on the day and what we are doing.  Two hours of undivided play time is great!  Unfortunately that is not always possible.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I usually give them at least 2-3 hours.Sometimes more if I am not busy.|`|0XzpNuvOaa	I'm another mom who works outside the home. If I didn't my kids would not have food to eat or a place to live. I work 9-5 and we have things to do throughout the week. Mondays we have cheer (5 y/o), Tuesdays counseling (5 y/o, possible PTSD), Wednesdays basketball (10 y/o), Thursdays girls scouts, Fridays are family night and completely chaotic, Saturdays are their games, Sundays we have have church. In a nutshell...we get home in time to eat, do homework, and get ready for bed. <br>  <br>  We live in Ohio so for half the year we cannot do too many outdoor activities. Ice skating would be great but we live in the middle of nowhere. Sledding? No, it's pretty flat where we live too. During the summer, or anytime it's above 55 or 60, we are always outside in the evenings. If we don't go to a playground or park we are hiking. <br>  <br>  Neither of my kids seem traumatized because I don't play with them everyday.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Before maternity leave, probably about an hour or so, but that's JUST playing. We usually spend a lot of time together doing other things. <br>  <br>  Lately, I've been getting all the house work done, and everything is organized & tidy (for once) that when he gets in from school, I have a lot of free to spend with him, and more free time to play with him for longer.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I try to spend at least a couple of hours with mine, but somedays it is less because they just want to do what they want to do.|`|EvMvSHULaa	I'm another working mom (Thumbs-Down Fairy, I'll see you in hell! :) ), but after getting home and doing dinner and homework, we usually play board games, poker, or have tickle sessions until bedtime.|`|AA11210211	I would say a couple hours at the least with my children,I am a kid at heart and love getting on the floor and playing with them.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	During the week, it's at least one hour a night (I work during the day).  Usually right when we get home, we go straight in and start playing!  Then we go fix dinner, etc.... On the weekends, it really depends on what we have going on, but it's usually at least 3-4 hours each day (yes, I'm a guilty working mom trying to make up what I missed out on during the week, lol).
KmC0K59taa	Wait until after you move.  He will need the comfort of his bottle until he gets used to the new place.  Moving is VERY stressful for babies.|`|DvrpBX4saa	How old is he? I'll be in that situation soon and plan on just getting rid of the bottles because my son is old enough to understand that with a new house, there will be some new changes. If your son is really young and not able to understand this though, you might rethink your plan. Being in a new place, he might want to be comforted by his bottles and it might make the move easier on him. Personally, I don't have an issue with babies having bottles past a year. My son still has his 3x a day and he's nearly 21 months. His teeth are growing fine and he drinks from a cup just fine as well.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Fortunately, this will be a great time to take his bottle away.<br>  Have him toss ALL of the bottles into the garbage (this way he knows they are gone or they ALL stayed with the prior house), use sippy cups and get on with life.|`|pRxzPiSbaa	personally, i would wait. children are very resilient though; i'm sure he would do fine either way.|`|j01zBZmZaa	I agree that this is the perfect time to take your son off the bottle. It may seem harsh to have two changes occur at once, but you can use the moving angle to your advantage and explain that you have to leave all the bottles at the old house (or something to that effect). He'll see boxes and changes and just assume that you're telling the truth. Oh, how wonderful to be an innocent child. However, I'd fix him up with a new goody bag filled with brand new big boy sippy cups so he won't feel completely gilted. Just tell him the new cups came with the new house. It'll be an adventure!|`|AA10186411	I will tell you what my mother said she did with me.  We were moving as well, and she just didn't put any bottles in the new house.  She told me that she left them all at the old house, and that I was pretty okay with it lol|`|AA11481889	I would dole out one trauma at a time.<br>  <br>  New house.<br>  New bedroom.<br>  New everything AND no mimi's?<br>  <br>  I'd put it off for a week or two depending on how old he is.
8pup9oWhaa	Hold her head up when on tummy, smile spontaneously, laugh (3m 2w), squeal, touch feet or legs, hold a rattle or similar toy, knock toys, follow a small object moved in front of her face.<br>  My girl is 3 months, she isn't laughing but she's almost there!|`|EIINtnIpaa	Dont Know|`|TZzWGFNMaa	I wasn't for sure so I looked it up heres a like to babyworld.com
2RFgrJCBaa	Hey hun!!!<br>  <br>  Well, I know that some woman have pregnancy symptoms early on.  Take me for instance.  When I was 3 DPO, I had nausea, cramping, bloating and everything.  My symptoms started early.  So it is possible to experience very, very early pregnancy symptoms.  I tested at 13DPO and got a clear line on a pregnancy test.  The line came up in matters of second and it was 2 days before my missed period.  So I honestly believe it is possible.  I'm no trying to get your hopes up, but anything is possible.  Oh yeah one thing that I did notice with me is that.  I had been taking multivitamins for the longest and noticed that right before I found out that I was pregnant it was getting hard for me to take them.  I had to wake myself up, take the pill, and go back to sleep.  I still have to do that now with my prenatal vitamins.<br>  <br>  But I hope for the best for you hun.  I know that the 2WW is going to be long time, but it's possible that you may be pregnant.  My for sure sign was when my boobs started hurting like hell.  Not your regular aunt flo type, but they hurt like some punched me in them, I had to keep checking for bruises cause I thought maybe I slept the wrong way or something. lol<br>  <br>  But best wishes and baby dust and sticky vibes to you.|`|AA12314337	Sorry, but it's way to early for the vomiting to be a sign of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Also, my OBGYN told me to have sex every other day, not every day. She said that sperm do not have enough time to build up if you have sex daily. (I had sex daily for 6 months. Got pregnant on the 7th month by having sex every other day). <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bo4MguzVaa	Could be....my early prenancy symptoms were super tiredness, feeling bloated, MAJOR moodiness, and nausia.<br>  I am not a barfer, so I have never barfed during a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Although, I would think you would need at least 1 to 2 weeks to have the pregnancy hormones affecting you that way.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Morning sickness vomit is usually a bile vomit rather then a normal sick vomit.  Sorry, I know that is gross.  But if you ovulated on Saturday then you wouldn't be far enough along to have any signs or symptoms.|`|721934bfc1f6d5517b1bb1caa6b48095aa	Did you take your vitamins on an empty stomach by chance?  If so this can make you throw up.  I learned that lesson real quick.  Make sure to eat before you take them.|`|mbP4pEJqaa	Take THE test. It tells the truth. If you want a baby and you are pregnant, YOUR PREGNANT!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, take a test!   If you have morning sickness then a test would be positive.|`|LCryvb7qaa	With my first pregnancy, I started feeling nauseous and vomited around a week before my missed period and thought the same thing as you and I was! I am 19 weeks pregnant with my second pregnancy and this time I felt great with no symptoms until a few weeks into the pregnancy and then I was nauseous 24/7. I don't think you'd feel it two days after conception, but you never know! Every pregnancy is different. The good news is you're not to far away from the test letting you know for sure! Good luck and keep trying!
a8ws0XVtaa	Honestly I felt great! Almost every ache and pain that I had during pregnancy just disappeared - and on top of all that, I had a beautiful healthy baby boy!|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Directly after, I didn't feel that emotional attachment yet, I wasn't sure what was wrong with me, then they put her on my chest and I nursed her and I felt this rush of accomplishment, when I got home, I was pissed off at my mom, for being her normal "i'm not getting all the attention" Bratty self!  I was sore, and scared to move too much, I felt unclean because of all the nastiness that comes out, and I couldn't wear a tampon to keep it at bay, so looking at those pads made me wanna puke. It was all worth it, when you see that beautiful  baby, it makes it all worth it in the end.|`|vjoyv5J6aa	I hear it depends on what kind of birth, C-Sections are out of commission for two weeks. If they cut you down there, that might make it more uncomfortable. If its a normal birth its not to horrible. Take it easy and while people are around take advantage of it. You get instant period and cramping. I hear that some people have a hard time with uterine contractions after.|`|ULTRJJ6waa	Exhausted, sore, overwhelmed, but HAPPY :-)|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	Felt like heaven .. oh to wait to see who is within you at that times feels so good and great <br>  <br>  Wonderful|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Tired.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	Exhilarated! I had a natural drug free birth an I was able to get up out of bed as soon as I delivered the placenta. I was awake for the next 24 hours or so. My son had health complications and the combination of adrenaline and nerves made it hard to even sit still. We went home a week later and I crashed. But all and all it was great. And still is a month later!|`|AA11538461	The first two hours I felt fine.  With my first one I had a thyroid crisis when she was five days old and I was very sick.  I was not strong enough to push the vacuum cleaner until she was three months old.  After my second one my immune system was low and I was sick and running a fever for ten days of every month for six months.  After my third one, I had arthritis in my tail bone for eight months.  The pain was more severe than labor.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I was very tired. I went home and cleaned because daddy has a different idea of clean then I do and then I took a nap after while everyone came and saw the baby! lol. It is not as bad as it seems really you get over it very quickly and forget. While I was in the hospital immediately after giving birth it was had for me to pee and you feel like you have a 100lbs of lead in your ***! But just keep ice packs on your bottom ( the rubber hospital gloves with ice in them work great ) and take it easy you will be back to your old self (nearly. lol. ) in no time. It is nothing to be worried about.|`|nzY94B7waa	I felt, sore, swollen, and crampy.  I was also really emotional....not really in a good way.  However the day after that I started to feel better.  Overall it is way better then the last weeks of pregnancy.  The happiness you get from having your new baby makes most of these discomforts feel like nothing.|`|AA11612508	i was ok with second baby. i was mopping bathroom floor the day i got home (thanks inlaws for not keeping house clean :(<br>  but otherthan that, ok. except for the nasty pads, i hate pads so its a disgusting feeling.
PbBWJGsTaa	Yes, terrified of it.  Basically i think we have to accept that theyre going to THINK that they hate us from about the age of 12 to 20.  Then they might realise that they love us again.  Parenting has to be selfless i keep telling myself.  We're always going to love them more than they love us.  I also think that phase is natural and nessecary, its all part of making themselves independent, which is something that they have to do.|`|MMdWfD1baa	i worry, for sure.  but there's nothing you can do.  just raise her right, and i'm sure she'll be a great teenager. :) <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgUrCswUYbLdIf0lHrCCs1Dsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223095700AAXTOqm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|SDjrojZXaa	omg yes i oppologize to my mom all the time lol for how disrespectful i was and the fact that i was sexually active at 15 and i thought i was grown by then hahaha. I guess my main goal will be to teach my son better and the thing i really worry about is the fact that now i can try to protect my son from bad things and as a teenager i know that wont be easy.and im with you i am loving every stage of my sons growing it is so amazing to see them learn and its so fun.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I kinda was, but now that it's here, it's wonderful!<br>  I think it's just making sure you lay a great, stable foundation for them through the very early years, then reinforce that as they grow (strong family values, consistent discipline, etc.). It pays off in the long run - throughout his growing up, we've always gotten super comments from people on our son's behaviour and actions - he's a fine young man.<br>  I do know it's different with girls but it can still be done if you two as parents keep a great thing going with your family, and pull together to raise a wonderful girl.|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	I am not looking forward to the phase where she becomes hateful about everything.  I remember that time and I just was hell to deal with.  I hope she feels comfortable enough to tell me anything though.  I don't want secrets between me and my little baby girl.|`|WirFwirLaa	I just can't imagine having a teenager, period! I know that one day my little boy will be one and I hope that I have raised him in a way that he will be a respectful gentleman no matter what his age.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	AGH! Yes yes yes! <br>  I have a 13 year old sister, and the way she acts towards everyone is crazy! Of course, I have a boy, so I'm hoping the hormones are different.|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	im both happy and sad that my daughter turned a year this past week and as for the teenage years i am prepared for almost anything.i worry about the same things you do but as long as you build a strong relationship with your daughter she will not go through the i hate my mother stage and even if she does she will come back around very quickly. just let her know you will be there for her and help her along the way of growing up and her changes. when she gets older you can also let her know that you love her very much and she can tell you anything without being judged.
tbLfz5FJaa	It does sound like PCOS but also sounds like Endemetriosis, which causes imense pain and heavy periods...you should book an app to see a gynaecologist. you could have both???<br>  If you have been trying over a year, it is said you should seek advise as you mey need a little help<br>  Good Luck and lots of babydust to you***************|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Its possible.  As far as I know the oily skin and dandruff aren't really signs of PCOS (even though I have both and have PCOS) but everything else sounds about right.  You should go to an OBGYN and let them know that you are ttc and have them test you for it.  They can give you a blood test or do an internal ultrasound to see if you have cysts.  If so then they will prescribe you Metformin and that should help you get pregnant quicker.|`|A8vsSMi4aa	Sounds like PCOS to me but you should schedule an appt with your dr and ask whats up! 15 months is a long time!
ApyrV5J9aa	My husband and I tried for 2 1/2 years. I finally got pregnant on my 8th round of clomid and metformin. I took this combo for 8 rounds but most doctors will not leave you on it past 6 rounds. I finally ovulated my 6th round on 150mg. The Dr tried 200mg for two more rounds and added in an IUI and I got pregnant on my second try of that. I am now going on 12 weeks pregnant. I took the clomid on days 5-9. The cycle that I got pregnant I took it between 10-10:30 am each day. Best of luck to you!|`|dBD8hDnWaa	Hey, I was on clomid for 2 months, first month I took 50mg, second it was 100mg.. I always took it at night, and on days 5-9!<br>  Good luck to you

He still falls over, but within 2-3 weeks I expect he'll be a pro.|`|eaO0MRaBaa	CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  ???
5jjGo6XTaa	Well with the calling you momma thing deff correct her just say no im dadda or daddy. but if you think somthing up you need to talk to the mother ask if theres somthing doing on abuse can be more then physical. talk to her parents more. the child can be wanting you more because momma might night be paying as much attention to the child. this happened to grandparents who practicly rase the grandchild. make sure shes getting the love she need when you not around from the mother. if momma is going out or just not noticing the child and playing witht the child plain and simple will not be attatched to the mother. talk to you child mother see whats up its not good for the child. if you think its somthing physical talk to you child shes old enough to know if somone is hurting her. but dont scare you child if you see blacks and blues ask did u fall was somone playing with you and hurt you maybe not on purpuse. and if she has a lot of dipar rashed she might be neglected to make sure she doesnt drop weight or even gain it to much. but be open with you feelings this is you child you have the right to know whats going on. she might just be missing you and not wanna leave you can also ask the mother if she misses you when your gone crys out for you when ur not their. seperation for a child is hard.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	Totally normal, don't stress about it.|`|oU23CYEWaa	daughters have a tenancy to be daddy's girls it may also be you show her more attention then her mother dose. i would not be to concerned rite now but if it get worse then i may ask her dr|`|TWeRUgXxaa	noh i believe that ur daughter is going to have a fit because she is attached to u for those for days that its hard for her to see her daddy leave her.. so no... that happens all the time.. my son is 17 months old and always does that|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	We used to have the same issue, when I tried to take her to her dads house, she would throw a huge fit and I was concerned just as you are. Eventually it stopped, not sure why. I talked to her dad and I even told him he could take her because she was so upset. Nothing I could figure out was causing her fits but they really upset me. She is probably just happy to be with you and doesn't want to leave, but Im sure that a few minutes after you are gone she has calmed down. Try not to worry too much unless you see signs of abuse, suspect it for another reason, or she tells you something that raises a flag. Good luck!!|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	It sounds perfectly normal. Children of her age crave a routine and when it is interrupted they don't like it. But if you start seeing some serious indications of child abuse, I'd act on it immediately.
XChiSgDZaa	very possible go to the doctor and ask|`|Mj1qhzcIaa	If you have regular periods it is nor likely to have PCOS. But the possibility can not be ruled out till you do the test. An ultrasound scan on the ovaries will show if you have many cysts on the ovary- thus Poly Cystic Syndrome. My younger sister has PCOS and gets very frequent and very heavy periods. She is on BCPs to control her hormones.<br>  You need to get tested to know. With 15 months of TTC, it is time to get checked up.<br>  Good luck dear!!!|`|JMj8HSaVaa	May i ask what does " PCOS " mean ?? i really dont know.. thanks|`|RR35cmBdaa	could be go to the doctor and see what they say. i have PCOS i had blood test done to tell me but that was it. i don't often get a period well can get it for 6 months nothing for 4 months and so on. i have been TTC for 4 years and nothing but found out last week i was so now im 6 weeks pregnant now. i dont take nothing for it  i don't know if they do give people anything for it couple of my friends have it and they don't take nothing for it.
PYiQGwsAaa	this may sound like a chat up line but keeley is one of my favourite names, probably because i fancy the actress keeley hawes|`|u7o75zipaa	Um, it's okay. I wouldn't use it personally and I prefer Kelly which is pretty similar.<br>  However it is pretty uncommon (in my area anyway) whereas my name is pretty common which gets quite annoying (Nicole/Nicky).|`|tZt7fUYYaa	no, but there was a girl at school called that and i didnt like her, so maybe im put off by that|`|AA10458195	Yes I do like that name. I think it was Patty Duke who played a character named Keely. It was a very old movie. I think Susan Hayward was in it. She was wearing a wig and Keeley threw it in<br>  the toilet.  My friend rented this movie years ago. I always liked the name & wished that it was mine.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Yes, I like the name Keeley, it means beautiful<br>  <br>  Keeley, Is a very pretty name|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	It's ok.|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I like it!!!|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i really like the name keeley :D i think it's a very pretty name, and it seems like a bubbly, energetic name. not a boring one at all :)|`|805NtgYpaa	My wife's name is Kiely (pronounced Keeley) and everyone we meet says it's a very unique and cool name.|`|3tlGOeDwaa	i quite like this name to as it is unusual and different!!! ccooooooooooollllllllllll xx|`|bcb975a6a5422a999658b591957e3b9faa	it doesn't matter who like & who don't the most important is that u do like<br>  <br>  any ways its nice|`|Iqh7U5Ypaa	erm.. i think it is a nice name.. but it's not something i would name my daughter|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Very nice|`|z2QYSFlvaa	its cute, mlre like a nickname|`|l7TqWO5Faa	I love the name and have even considered using it- if i ever have another girl.|`|7VnPj8i5aa	yes i think that name is so cute!

I don't care for Dale, I always think "Stale Dale" when I hear it, even though that's really cheesy. It also reminds me of Step Brothers.|`|94106f122aa0859301482207e00eda9caa	Andrew Robert<br>  <br>  Not a big fan of Dale or Darryl. Sorry.|`|FsiG5WtQaa	I like Darryl Andrew.

hY5mMi90aa	what u r doing is a great way to bond; music volume does effect their ears; when we r born our senses r really strong.  Cover her/his ears and just enjoy,  You can use your body as a cover on one side and blanket or diaper on other or use a hoodie from a sweatshirt.  Some volume doesn't hurt maybe dance in rm where the stereo isn't but still fun for u.|`|eaO0MRaBaa	Babies ears are actually only a tiny bit more sensitive than ours. i say as long as you can hear the doorbell ring then it should be ok.|`|zq9kng8Saa	You arent harming her ears if you dont have it too loud. But yes they do have sensitive ears|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	you could hurt her ears if the music is to high <br>  babies ears are more sestive than adults|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Babies ears are more sensitive in that they can, in general, hear a wider RANGE of tones than an adult.  This is why teenagers tend to be able to hear the "bumblebee ring tone" and adults usually can not.<br>  <br>  Of course some adults have damaged their hearing and what doesn't seem loud to them would seem loud to a normal person or particularly a baby or child.  However if it were too loud for baby they'd cry.<br>  <br>  If you want a "rule" you could keep it quieter than baby's loudest cry.  Afterall their crying doesn't hurt their hearing and that's really close to their ears ;-)
2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i didnt have a epi and was ok NOT great hopefully you will go natural as beng induced suxs and makes it worse. second baby should be better (that is what dr told me ) i had bad labor last time too 18 hr all natural .|`|a8ws0XVtaa	My water broke at 39 weeks but I didn't have any contractions so they had to give me pitocin to give me contractions and make them stronger.  They pain of the contractions were WAY worse than getting the epidural - they epidural did not hurt, they numb the area first and by the time you can have one, you will welcome the relief.  After I recieved my epidural, I was able to take a little nap before it was time to push and it helped me rest so that I could have energy to push.  Good luck and congrats on the new baby.|`|AA11784984	Epidural with all three of my kids and if I have another thats what I will use. Everyone has their pros and cons about it but it worked for me!!|`|xocIN0scaa	Epidural = every womans best friend<br>  <br>  it does not hurt to get by the way..i didnt feel it at all :)|`|tZt7fUYYaa	I was also induced, it was my first baby and i had pre eclampsia so they needed to get me along. i did have an epidural and at the time i didnt give a crap, i just had it. only thing i didnt like was having a catheter but i dont think i could of dealt with the pain without it. my contractions were showing as 20 on the machine then 30 and just after epidural went up to 52 and i coulnt feel a thing.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	I had nubane, but I feel it lead to breasfeeding failure as the baby was too sleepy to latch on for a few days.  AND I was too ignorant to understand that at the time.<br>  <br>  The reason the epidural is preferable is because no medicine goes to the baby.  It stays in the sac around the spine.  It is no worse than the IV they will have to stick in your hand to get any other type of medicine.<br>  <br>  Ask for a walking epidural.  You don't want to be so numb that you don't feel a single thing.  You want just enough to take the edge off.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I took castor oil twice to avoid pitocin and I was able to labor at home in  my own comfortable environment instead of being in their environment where they most likely won't want to feed you anything but water during labor which can be a drag if it goes too long.

(Autumn, Aubrey, Aaron, Adam, Ace, Allie, Abbie, & Ambree)|`|guVczXfUaa	I like Maddox, but I think he only pulls it off because of his famous parents.  I don't think it'd be as cool a name for a regular guy.<br>  Zahara, Shiloh Nouvel, Vivienn Marcheline, and Bronx are all really cool names.  I like Knox, but not in the same family as Maddox and Pax.  Harlow is pretty, but I don't like the middle name Winter.  Oddly enough, I love the name December (go figure).<br>  The rest are either so-so or all out bad.

BW7Nrqjzaa	I craved spicy food. I ate Tabasco on everything. I actually made myself sick a couple of times by eating too many cherry peppers. And I had a boy. But with my first boy I ate nothing but grilled cheese sandwiches and pickles. And with my daughter I drank like 4 fruit smoothies everyday...|`|7kosr9mcaa	I had a boy and I craved fruity and salty things...I craved chicken wings, even though I was a vegetarian.

l4mMBe5Aaa	We used the smallest swim diapers, even though they were a bit too big...  They DO NOT hold pee in, anyway (which I found out the hard way - I put the swim diaper on before we left to go to the pool...  Whoops!  Wet car seat...).  Even one that is a little bit too big will hold poo in, and the swim diapers are designed not to hold a bunch of water, so they won't weigh your son down (and they won't fall apart in the water!)...|`|wURg3jBcaa	I'm wondering the same thing...we're going to the grandparents' house in AZ and I want to put my 3 month old in the pool...I may try to put her in the smallest swim diaper I can find and pray it doesn't leak.  I'll put a swimsuit over it to help it stay in place.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Just a regular diaper. Those swimmer things only hold poop, not pee, anyway, and all the pool chemicals will neutralize the urine in the pool anyway.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I was going to suggest using a clothe diaper too.<br>  <br>   You don't have to worry so much about urine, but it's not fun scooping poop out of a pool... Or an exploded diaper. We found out my my SIL let he 2 year swim in our pool with his diaper on. She then left it there for us to find when we came home from vacation a week later... She left the diaper on our cement deck and the poop in the pool. She said she couldn't figure out how to get it out... <br>  <br>  Oh and if you're going to a water park they usually insist on you using a special swim diaper.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	For my pool  you have to have a swim diaper and plastic pants.

W1p6LetFaa	Unfortunately I think it is just something you will have to deal with.  It sucks, I know.  It didn't get really bad for me until I got to be about 38 weeks. I have heard that it actually gets a lot worse immediately after you have the baby because your hormones are going haywire, but a few weeks after birth you should start to go back to "normal."  Perhaps put a few extra layers of sheets on your bed or even put a towel on your side of the bed that you can change whenever you get back from the bathroom.  Be sure to keep the room a little cooler than you did before and (as backward as this sounds) be sure you are drinking plenty of water.  And just remember that it's only temporary!!<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|MtC3CWZraa	I think of pregnancy as a preview of menopause. It’s a hormonal thing and all you can do is to try and keep your room as cool as possible.|`|uuHPneEcaa	I always wake up like that, that is because my grandmother keeps the house so hot. I've tried using fans and cracking the window a lil bit but I still wake up soaking wet from sweat. I guess its something u have to deal with

l4mMBe5Aaa	We just celebrated our daughter's first birthday party with a gathering of family and friends at our home.  We had it in the afternoon (after her nap!) with just appetizer-type finger foods.  We decorated the entire downstairs, and made a dvd of pictures from pregnancy to present and had that playing on our tv in the living room.  Everyone just socialized, ate, sang Happy Birthday, and watched our daughter open gifts.  It was wonderful!|`|X6as2nOAaa	He won't remember anyways but I still want a fun one for my baby, we are just having a bbq and will have a slide into a little pool and her decorations and things like that, just something really fun, she will not be one until july 25th but I'm still excited.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	How about a park?|`|6vdSFw5Jaa	I would just have family and friends over and have a theme that he enjoys. My oldest had Elmo and my youngest had John Deere. We served pizza at one, and had a deli sandwich buffet at the other. <br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty about not going as overboard. He won't know the difference and as long as the people that love him are there, that is what will make the day fun and memorable.

So we are having a St. Patrick's Day theme, since our son was born on St. Patrick's Day, but having the party on a Saturday so everyone can make it!  <br>  If your baby is in the summer, I would have a cook out!  Or maybe if your family and friends are adventurous, you could even have a cook OFF, like bbq or chilli or something like that ;)|`|2LmfQUbKaa	have your husband of brother go to your local costume store and rent a costume of his favorit cartoon film it and he will have a great time i did that for my oldest 2st b-day! hope it works for you!|`|DVtnf0Zeaa	When is your son's birthday?

VMASMHX6aa	OPKs have a much higher cut off than HPTs. A HPT is sensitive from 10miu/ml but an OPK is only sensitive from 30min/ml.<br>  <br>  So an OPK won't show up HCG when a pregnancy test is showing negative. It would only show up HCG after a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  I don't think you can read much into the line on the OPK. Bear in mind that you wouldn't normally be doing OPKs at this stage of your cycle so you don't know what result you would normally get at this stage in your cycle.<br>  <br>  Give it a few more days and test again.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yes it can be used as a HPT, but not usually this far away from your period.|`|4X6MwQJRaa	I would have to say from experience that they are not accurate to be used as a HPT.  I thought the same as you and for the hell of it used one to see if it was positive when I thought I was pregnant and it was a definate negative.  This was 5 days after missed period.  So then took a HPT and it was very dark positive.  I have heard that it is possible it will be positive if you are pregnant but I would not get your hopes up.  Take a HPT when you have missed your period to be sure. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ugbe40X3aa	opk's can detect pregnancy before hpt's have a look at this website it will help and good luck <br>  www.peeonastick.com

If the pain is like at the beginning of your anus, then that might be hemorrhoids. If it doesnt go away in the next few days I would ask the doctor about it...although, he will probably want to look, and possibly give you an "exam"...so if i could deal with it, i would, lol. But thats just me.|`|OU9xnW86aa	Hmm...I don't know what that could be. Maybe a internal hemorrhoid? Sorry to hear about the yeast infection, those are no fun! I'd say if the pain persists put a call into your doctor and ask about it. Good luck!!
28QPS6V9aa	No, do you think he could be teething?|`|1eafc7d2745d873056abda89fd644203aa	7 months isn't too young to start spanking. I'm just sayin!|`|lpVgMkgcaa	teething, maybe gas, you should try to get him in for an appt if it becomes an issue.  thankfully, we didnt go though that with my daughter!|`|X6as2nOAaa	No my baby hardly cries which I thought was weird but she does whine though, you can start spoiling them at this age so could that be it or maybe he is teething? I guess you could ask your doctor?|`|FMmncxToaa	There has to be a reason, maybe he is teething,  hungry, sleepy,  have gas or he could be colicky .Sometimes they get spoiled if you carry them too much though... He is only 7 months old. Did you try speaking to your pediatrician?See what he tells you.
ZkDmJtAsaa	No, you would not be able to find out.<br>  <br>  The bigger problem is why you have not had a period in one year. For that, you should seek medical advice on immediately- there could be serious problems that would cause you to miss your menstrual cycle twelve times in a row.<br>  <br>  Once you have that figured out, then you can work on ovulation tests which will help you determine when you should have sex in order to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  If you are not trying to get pregnant, then you should be using condoms if you are not with an exclusive partner that both of you have been tested for STD's, or other forms of protection if you are both exclusive and already tested.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	No you can't find out today.  Sorry.|`|3427eebd84da66693a5d9d29a3fcc54caa	Errr...his sperm are not even in your tubes yet. Their still on the journey.<br>  <br>  So that would be a no on the finding out today thing.
HSUfe3m7aa	I took Doxylamine (Unisom) and B6 which is the equivalent of Biclectin/Diclectin prescriptions for morning sickness. You have to make sure it's the right Unisom with the Doxylamine in it.<br>  <br>  They cost me 8$ when the prescription was over $100. Take the Unisom at night as it will make you sleepy (it's regular use is a sleeping pill)<br>  <br>  Feel better!!|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	dont get dehydrated. my morning sickness did they same thing. it came back for about 3 weeks and now i have had nothing in about 4 weeks. you have to drink!!!! water, gatoraide something. try tea put some ginger in it to relaxe your belly..<br>  hang in there, and apply for state health insurace right away. <br>  <br>  i also ate alot of popcicles when my sickness was bad. there cheep and keep you hydrated. also not bad on my belly|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	seek health insurance in the state you live in. They'll give you insurance since your pregnant.|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	Ok, firstly you need to get re hydrated so go to your local ER and get some help. Let them know how long ago it was since you actually kept something down. Let them know that you don't have any insurance and they might be able to do more. Ask them also if they can't prescribe you something for the vomiting, a scrip for 30 anti nausea pills is only like $15.00 and they are safe for use during pregnancy. I know because I had severe hyperemisis when I was pregnant with both my children. <br>  <br>  Once you are feeling better go to your local department of social security. Call first and ask what you would need to bring in to apply for medicaid and whatever other help you can get (WIC, Food stamps) They will probably want proof of your pregnancy from your doctor, and proof of your last wages. If you qualify, not only will you get good prenatal care but as soon as your baby is born he or she will have medicaid so he/she can see a pediatrician. Also, they will go back and pay off your doctors bills and your ER visits. After you have the baby you can figure out how to get back into a job and slowly wean off of government services. Don't think of it in a bad way, think about it this way: you have been working since whenever and you have been paying taxes that go towards government programs. So I reality you are just taking some of it back, and as soon as you can you will start working and paying it back some more. <br>  <br>  Ps Check with your local WIC office about a baby well program, most states have them. You go to parenting classes to earn points towards baby gear and diapers and that sort of thing. Also, check out your local church, they might be willing to help some. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|a8ws0XVtaa	you should call your local hospital and ask about women's clinics that offer services without health insurance.  Also for a long term insurance, you should contact your local job and family service department for medicaid options. I know exactly how you feel, its hard to do anything when you feel so sick and stressed out at the same time.  Please take care of yourself for not only you, but your baby too.  You baby is relying on you to take of him/her.  Good luck|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I know this isn't the answer you are looking for, but... you don't want to put your baby at risk by not going to the MD if you feel this bad.  You can get dehydrated quickly.  Tell the office manager that you will have to work out a payment plan, that's what we did.  Good luck.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	apply for medicaid.|`|OdFIQYyhaa	i feel sorry for you but don't get stressed ok try and get a job and insurance. ok|`|jLLkSWyiaa	hey how bout this! ever thought that your TOO YOUNG TO HAVE SEX!!?? shoulda kept your pants up!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	call the local social services about getting on state insurance-maybe its just from the financial stress!|`|Z1FdawAOaa	whatever you do, DO NOT stress out. as hard as that may sound you can't do it for your child's sake.
c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Usually implantation bleeding is so light it is barely noticeable. Just streaks of reddish pink (or brown) among the CM when you wipe and only lasts a day or so (may only happen once or twice withing that time frame)<br>  When I had it witrh my first pregnancy I had the tiniest amount of pink on the toilet issue when I wiped 13dpo and got a bfp the next day. <br>  I also had some spotting last week Thurs. about 5dpo it was brownish on Wed night and then one time thurs it was reddish streaked through my CM and that was about it. I'm waiting to test until Fri or Sat to find out (if it was implantiation or not)|`|Xh5rWuGhaa	I had i/b with my first pregnancy (m/c at 4 weeks in Nov). It was about a week before my period. I noticed it when I wiped (just once) I figured it was AF starting early and put a tampon in (there was barely anything on the tampon) and no more bleeding after that. But I read it can be very light and last 1-3 days. When are you due for your period? If its in about a week then the chance of it being implantation bleeding are good!
cAtWxJG1aa	Not from a single question or answer.  But from a long series of questions or answers, I sometimes (though not with everyone) develop confidence that someone is or is not in fact a parent.  I wouldn't make any strong assumptions about them beyond that.<br>  <br>  As for their age ... no, though occasionally I'd be willing to bet my top contributpr badge (which doesn't matter to me much) that someone is not yet an adult.<br>  <br>  But meow gets my thumb up on this question.|`|AA11210211	I think sometimes you can but not always.It also depends on how you articulate your words and express yourself but you can't always use this because there is always an exception to the rule.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Sometimes it is hard to try to put an age to an avatar (lol) but you can tell regardless how mature they are by their answers. I'm definitely a real parent (when my avatar shows up anyway you can see my little ones), but I really try not to wonder who's real or not (besides my contacts). It's all the roll on the dice here and you could possibly be talking to anyone, that's the way I see it.|`|j2mRop0laa	LOL.. I'm really bad at guessing ages. I thought Des was 50. No offense, des!!<br>  Uhm.. I like Britney Spears and Twizzlers for lunch. I'm sort of loopy, but I can guarantee you I am a mother and proud of it. I'm in my late twenties.. but once I hit 30 I'm no longer aging. :)|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I think sometimes you can tell age.  It just really depends on the person.  I like to think that some posters on here are just trolls trying to get people riled up, lol|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Yes, I can usually tell by spelling/grammer, avatar (sometimes), profile info, or Q&A.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I think most of the people come on her for honest advice and give honest answers.  I have noticed that more and more people are pregnant with triplets and when you read their previous questions they will be asking about the Jonas Brothers or if a guy in their 6th grade science class likes them. With that being said, I have a lot of contacts that are roughly the same age as I am (30's) and there are times we act like we are 12 so no, I don't think you can always guess.|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	no, I don't think you can. And it's really up to them if they want to lie about their age or not. I think that if they are kids asking or teens asking, they'd mostly be asking simple questions or questions asking if they are pregnant or not. Also , by the way they spell, but it's really hard because some are lying. Some don't have kids but are really knowledgable because they are taking child care classes or baby sitting <br>  <br>  why does it matter anyway? just wondeirng.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	I think you can tell if someone really is a parent by their answers. Bad answers usually suggest that they're not really a parent.<br>  <br>  But I don't think you can tell how old someone is. Lots of young people make great parents, just like some older people make terrible ones.<br>  <br>  I'm fairly young for a parent, but I think I'm mature  and sensible.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	It's hard to tell sometimes. Most people have good answers, but then you get the kid who says she's a lawyer and is pregnant with sextuplets and then gives you all the names and links to all the expensive baby furniture she is going to buy. I try to ignore those people and just let them play their little game.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Somewhat...<br>  <br>  You can also tell the parents of the future serial killers....<br>  <br>  They are the ones who are freaking out about every little detail of their poor children's lives...

She is 10 years older then me (im 21) and we share almost the exact same views on raising our baby girls. I guess it all depends on maturity.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Yes, absolutely.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think for some you can tell for sure..without a doubt.|`|xocIN0scaa	I think that answer lies in the question that the person is asking.. when someone ask something like " I am 14 and my boyfriend got me pregnant after he shacked up with my uncles goats" then yes..i think its either a really young person or a troll... but some people actually ask real questions about pregnancy and childcare that are legitimate concerns to most people.<br>  What I can't stand are the pleb askers.. the ones that have a long winded story about how their boyfriend beats them and "does them wrong" and wants to know how to murder their unborn baby. I think that either there are a lot of trolls out there or a lot of fuc*** up people out there.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Absolutely. I can always call when the user is a real adult parent and when they are a teenage baby-momma. The first indicator is usually spelling, grammar, then comes the pretentious attitude...young answerers usually have a 'know-it-all' tone to their answers. They do not conceed that their opinion is only thier opinion. They answer like they are the authority.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Sometimes.  It would be easier if tone was easier to determine.  Some of my answers are sarcastic and I can see someone maybe thinking that I am a child, or have no kids- but that is far from the truth!  <br>  <br>  There are some answers where I think "this person has no kids and is a child themselves" and it may or may not be true.  That's the great thing about the internet- anonymity!<br>  <br>  Also, I would say that some people are adults and their 12 year old kids get on under their names.  All of a sudden you will see an answer or a question and you know that the tone does not reflect the persons usual tone!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I was bought up believing that you could tell a lot by the way someone articulated their selves.<br>  If people want to attack me, go right ahead.

I know, if I didn't say my age, on occasion, many wouldn't guess *my* age, if they base 'maturity' on ludicrous things... I won't get into it, here, but, I'll just say some people are on high horses, and look down on those who may do things, differently.|`|EzcQOTPtaa	For the most part, you can tell how about how old somebody is.

OrKpKxkHaa	I'm pretty sure it is reccomended for the first year that you use either boiled and cooled tap water or bottled water. I'm sure many parents have safely used tap water but I'm sure it is reccomended for a reason and I wouldn't want to use my baby as a "guinea pig" to find out why! If you do decide to use tap water (boiled or not) use cold not hot. Hot water releases lead from the pipes. Good luck!|`|AA11210211	You can use tap,I have never used boiled,sterilized water with my children and they are just fine:)|`|Fd4lITkvaa	If your drinking water is safe for you to drink it's safe for your baby, no need for special water. Just turn the tap on to warm water and use it.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	You can just use tap water, but since it is city water I would get one of those brita filters for your sink and that is really just the same as if you pay for it at the store.

Fluoridated water can cause flouridosis of the adult teeth when used to make formula because of how much a baby consumes.  <br>  <br>  Also unless you have soft water the amount of minerals can be too much, particularly after the water is boiled.  Formula is designed to have all the minerals the baby needs.<br>  <br>  If using powdered infant formula you should know that 14% of all powdered formula is contaminated with dangerous bacteria or viruses; because it is not sterilized during the manufacturing process.  For this reason it must be prepared correctly which means using water that is no less than 70C to prepare it.<br>  <br>  Also don't forget that your health, in addition to the baby's, is at risk if you wean early.  If anyone in your family has had breast cancer, cervical cancer, or ovarian cancer you might want to reconsider.  Breastfeeding also reduces the risks of osteoporosis, heart disease, and diabetes in mom -the longer you do it the lower your risk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/positions/statements/fluoride_infants.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/positi...</a><br>   The ADA offers these recommendations so parents, caregivers and health care professionals who are concerned have some simple and effective ways to reduce fluoride intake from reconstituted infant formula.<br>  <br>      * Breast milk is widely acknowledged as the most complete form of nutrition for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends human milk for all infants (except for the few for whom breastfeeding is determined to be harmful).<br>  <br>      * For infants who get most of their nutrition from formula during the first 12 months, ready-to-feed formula is preferred to help ensure that infants do not exceed the optimal amount of fluoride intake.<br>  <br>      * If liquid concentrate or powdered infant formula is the primary source of nutrition, it can be mixed with water that is fluoride free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis. Examples are water that is labeled purified, demineralized, deionized, distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water. Many grocery stores sell these types of drinking water for less than $1 per gallon.<br>  <br>      * The occasional use of water containing optimal levels of fluoride should not appreciably increase a child’s risk for fluorosis.<br>  <br>  Parents and caregivers should consult with their pediatrician, family physician or dentist on the most appropriate water to use in their area to reconstitute infant formula. Ask your pediatrician or family physician whether water used in infant formula should be sterilized first (sterilization, however, will not remove fluoride).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infactcanada.ca/Newsletters/2007-Winter/safety_guidlines.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infactcanada.ca/Newsletters/2...</a><br>  E. sakazakii is a highly virulent bacteria which is resistant to the high-temperature processing methods used in food production. If infants, especially those who are newborn, low-birthweight or premature, are infected with E. sakazakii, it can cause meningitis, necrotizing entercolitis, and sepsis, and is potentially fatal. As a result of reports of baby deaths from E. sakazakii contamination in recent years the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have declared this a significant public health hazard and have convened two expert meetings on the issue: one in 2004 and more recently in January of 2006. After reviewing the scientific evidence the 2006 meeting produced a report noting that both manufacturers and governments must act to reduce the health risks associated with the intrinsic contamination by E. sakazakii. Studies reviewed by the meeting noted that up to 14 per cent of formula packages may be contaminated by the bacteria.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/pif_guidelines.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publicatio...</a><br>  Powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness and death in infants due to infections<br>  with Enterobacter sakazakii. During production, PIF can become contaminated with harmful bacteria, such as<br>  Enterobacter sakazakii and Salmonella enterica. This is because, using current manufacturing technology, it is<br>  not feasible to produce sterile PIF. During the preparation of PIF, inappropriate handling practices can exacerbate<br>  the problem.<br>  Recognizing the need to address such hazards in PIF, Codex Alimentarius decided to revise the Recommended<br>  International Code of Hygienic Practice for Foods for Infants and Children. In doing so it requested specific<br>  scientific advice from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health<br>  Organization (WHO). FAO and WHO have provided this advice in the reports of two expert meetings held in<br>  2004 and 2006 on Enterobacter sakazakii and other microorganisms in powdered infant formula (PIF). Part of<br>  this advice included recommendation to develop guidelines for the preparation of PIF.<br>  The World Health Assembly (WHA) of WHO requested in 2005 the Organization to develop such guidelines on<br>  the safe preparation, handling and storage of PIF in order to minimize the risk to infants.<br>  The FAO/WHO advice on E. sakazakii in PIF includes a quantitative microbiological risk assessment of E. sakazakii<br>  in PIF. One of the aspects of the risk assessment was to determine relative risk reduction associated with<br>  different preparation, storage and handling scenarios. The recommendations made in the present guideline<br>  document are largely based on the findings of the quantitative risk assessment. No risk assessment was carried<br>  out for Salmonella, but the group reported that the basic risk control principles for E. sakazakii would also hold<br>  true for S. enterica.<br>  In general, sterile liquid infant formula is recommended for infants at the highest risk of infection. Where sterile<br>  liquid infant formula is not available, preparation of PIF with water at a temperature of no less than 70 °C<br>  dramatically reduces the risk. Minimizing the time from preparation to consumption also reduces the risk, as<br>  does storage of prepared feed at temperatures no higher than 5 °C.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1495189" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...</a><br>  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS<br>  Mineral levels varied among tap water sources in North America and among bottled waters. European bottled waters generally contained higher mineral levels than North American tap water sources and North American bottled waters. For half of the tap water sources we examined, adults may fulfill between 8% and 16% of their Ca2+ DRI and between 6% and 31% of their Mg2+ DRI by drinking 2 liters per day. One liter of most moderate mineralization European bottled waters contained between 20% and 58% of the Ca2+ DRI and between 16% and 41% of the Mg2+ DRI in adults. High mineralization bottled waters often contained up to half of the maximum recommended daily intake of Na+.<br>  CONCLUSION<br>  Drinking water sources available to North Americans may contain high levels of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+ and may provide clinically important portions of the recommended dietary intake of these minerals. Physicians should encourage patients to check the mineral content of their drinking water, whether tap or bottled, and choose water most appropriate for their needs.|`|cMc4B1Ssaa	Only use cold water from the tap!

Our brother school is the all guys school we are associated with.<br>  <br>  I put myself through Hell trying to get my parents to allow me to go to the guys school mixer. I had heard bad things (dangerous and creepy) about them from my friends and the only reason I wanted to go and risk it was because this guy I liked who supposedly liked me back was going. I spent all week trying to convince my parents. I did extra chores, never fought with my siblings, did everything they asked, I even gave up free time to practice extra on my instruments and do my brother's and sister's chores. It was the hardest working week of my life. I still ended up letting my mom help pick out my outfit. They said yes of course but it took forever and a lot of work. That night we exchanged numbers and we talked every day for a month. We went on a date in October. But in the end, 1 week after the date, things didn't work out between us. It was a total waste of work and time to go. <br>  <br>  <br>  Ah the things girls will do for guys is amazing. And the best part is, guys don't even know what we go through. Watch this video.

a1x0xqARaa	I remember the night before I had my baby.  We went over to a friend's house for a few hours.  We were actually kidding around about when I would have the baby because I still felt like it would never happen.  My friend put his hand on my belly and tried to predict when the baby would be born.  We left their place around 9 or so and were in bed by 9:30.  As soon as I was laid down and relaxed, that's when the contractions started!  I had them until 6 AM and went to the hospital and was admitted by 7.  I was already dilated at 9 and had him literally 2 hours later, after 10 minutes of pushing!!  So it can come out of nowhere, or it can be an all day feeling like crap thing.  Every one is different.  Good luck!!|`|a8ws0XVtaa	I felt like my baby was just going to stay in my belly forever - I had no symptoms or signs that he was coming.  Finally at 39 weeks my water broke, but there was no indication that it was going to happen in the days or weeks before that happened.  Don't worry, baby can't stay in forever.  In the meanwhile enjoy the nights that you can sleep more than two hours at a time!!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	with number 1, nothing happened the day before or the weeks before. not a pain, not a contraction, nothing.

I worked all that day and went into full-blown labour about two hours after getting home from work and delivered the next morning.
vue9NOhYaa	Rice cereal is very constipating for some babies, and isn't necessary.<br>  <br>  I would stop the rice cereal.  If she enjoys solids, try something else that's less likely to back her up. (Oatmeal, or jarred fruits/veggies [not bananas, they're also binding])  Otherwise, just stop solids completely for a few weeks. Her system may not be quite ready to handle them.|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Just give your baby an ounce or two of water...that will help the poop flow.|`|a1x0xqARaa	Apple juice always made my son give a good bowel movement when I had doubts about that.....Good luck!
qStmw7qgaa	You risk infection anytime you get a tattoo...but I personally would wait until after you are done breast feeding...because you could be infecting your breast milk if you get an infection, and you don't want to pass that to your little one.  So I would wait.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	you can get a tat while breastfeeding its not recomended because just like while prgnant you body is busy. while pregger you body was busy making a baby now your body is busy making milk. and having a tat that you body will need to heal it might not heal right and look messed up. there can also be a lighting to it as if it was an old tat so if you want a good looking tat tha heals properly and fast id wait let you body make your milk.|`|SxHvknWMaa	According to Pregnancy.org<br>  <br>  "We suggest that people wait until breastfeeding is over before being tattooed, because making milk requires a lot of energy so you may not want to heal a tattoo during this time. Talk to your tattoo artist for their thoughts." ~licensed tattooist<br>  <br>  You risk contracting a blood borne disease or infection in body decoration procedure that involves breaking the skin if the needles used are not properly sterilised or are contaminated in some way. Should the underlying tissue become infected, there is a slight risk that it could alter your milk in clarity and amount.<br>  <br>  While pre-existing tattoos and piercings do not generally present problems during breastfeeding or pregnancy, it is advisable not to get new ones until after the baby is born and weaned from the breast. For more specific information, be sure to talk to your health care provider to make the most informed choice for you.|`|kf1PWDb8aa	When you get a tattoo you are taking a chance of it getting infected and if it does you will have to take medications to help the infection and the medications you can not take while you are breastfeeding. So you should wait until you are done breastfeeding!! Good luck hope you get a cool one!!|`|TZzWGFNMaa	I wouldn't for the simple fact if your tattoo gets infected it could travel to the breast milk and make your baby sick|`|vue9NOhYaa	The ink will not get into the milk or anything like that.  The only risk would be the same as at any other time -- infection from equipment that hasn't been properly sterilized. (And if you are nursing, that infection could get into the milk and harm your baby.) <br>  <br>  If the tattoo place is clean and the artist is professional, go for it.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I have actually looked into this because I want a tattoo also. My midwife said that it should be absolutely fine as long as I go to a very clean reputable artist. I spoke to a few local tattoo shops and the first one said that they don't do breast feeding women because the pain will make their milk dry up (which is not true at all). The second shop I talked to I said they would do it but that it was extremely painful to get it done anywhere on the upper body (breasts, chest, back, shoulder) because the nerves are all connected to glands and such. Actually the girl I was talking to said she got a tattoo on her back while nursing and she said she had to take t3's for a week it was so ridiculously painful.<br>  <br>  I still haven't got mine yet I wanted it on my back. I've also always wanted one on my wrist so I think I'm going to get that one done first just to test the whole pain thing.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Depending on the location of the tattoo they might do it. But most tattoo places will recommend waiting until your done breastfeeding. Thats due to the stress that it will be put onto your body changing your breastmilk slightly.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	If you are paying good money for a tattoo do you really want the tattoo artist to be staring at your swollen breasts while your infant is suckling? He won't do a very good job if he is distracted........cheers|`|vJEatJFPaa	I would not. Just incase...I would consult your peditrician.
Fy9S6hjIaa	Well, my son is only 21 months old, so he doesn't really "say" that much, but he did do something absolutely hilarious the other day.  We're in the process of potty training, and he was sitting on the potty.  It was taking a while so I gave him one of those hard cardboard books to read while he was on the pot.  After awhile I could tell he wasn't going to go, so I said OK, are you all done?  Of course he immediately started to hop off the potty and at the same time he slammed the book shut.  Well, I don't know how he did it, but he slammed his little wee-wee right in the middle of the book.  The look on his face was priceless. He looked down at the book, looked back up at me and slowly said "Owwwwwww mama, owwwwww".  Then he opened the book, pointed his finger at it and said "NO NO", then commenced to get down off the potty, run in the living room and put his book in the "time out corner".  Then, we put his undies back on and he went back in the living room, picked up the book, nicely said "no no ouchy, k"  Then gave it a hug and a kiss.  Just like I do when I get him out of time out.  It was soooooo cute!<br>  <br>  Another thing happened the other day that was so funny, but made me feel really guilty at the same time.  I have a terribile habit of saying "Damn it  Mason..."  When I'm frustrated and he's acting up.  Well, the other day it really caught up with me because he had my makeup bag and I took it away from him.  He looked up at me with a stern face and said "Damn it Mom" just clear as a bell.  Needless to say I've quite using that particular frase.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	I have a 2 and 3 yr old  and the funniest well maybe not the funniest but the most shocking thing my two yr old has said was one day at my moms house she had gone into the bathroom and shut the door and he was standing there kicking the door and starts to scream "Open this damn door". Grandma didnt think it was too funny.<br>  <br>  My 3 yr old is really into electronics hes got a laptop and a psp. one day he was tryiing to put a plastic comb in the socket and I told him if he ever put anything in there he would "get dead" and then he asked if "I would put him on the charger." (like when his batteries die)|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	We have a restaurant near our house called the Firefly Grill. My 2 year old son loves going there, so the other day, as a special treat, I took my boys out to lunch there. We got in the car and I asked my 2 year old if he wanted to eat at Firefly. He answered "Yeah! Eat Firefly!" Apparently he was back there thinking about it for a minute because after a few moments he asked "Eat Itsy Bitsy Spider too?" He thought we were actually going to be eating fireflies.....and wondered if there would be other bugs on the menu too :)|`|23bgwpD1aa	As my 4 yr old was being punished he turned to me and said "Do you want me to turn into Batman"|`|Ow6lKFXiaa	Well, she's 11 now so not exactly recent, but:<br>  <br>  My husband was trying to convince my, then 3-year-old, precocious, daughter that football was the greatest thing ever invented and his alma matter was, of course, the greatest team ever created.  He was teaching her the game as if she was more like 8.  I countered that he was going way over her head and she didn't even know what a touchdown was.<br>  <br>  She very indignantly shouted at me, "I do so know what a touchdown is!"<br>  <br>  "Ok", I replied, "what is a touchdown?"<br>  <br>  With hands on hips she very adamantly and with great self assurance replied, "It's a dance!"|`|HdOVYIWjaa	I don't have any kids, but I hear a lot of cute stories about me when I was younger.  The cutest thing I think I've said is when one of my aunt's was going on a trip to Miami I asked her if I can go to "your-ami" with her. (I was talking to her).  I always thought that was cute, I was only 3 or 4 at the time.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	My son isn't talking yet, but my 8 yr old nephew said the funniest, random thing the other day. My sister had taken him and his little sister to eat lunch and he said "Mom, brush Gracie's hair and wipe her face because I don't want people to think we are poor!". Both kids looked fine and being poor, what does he know about that?! LOL.|`|S9ZyjTyyaa	Since I've been potty training my 2 year old daughter she likes to run around with no pull up or pants on. So the other day I told her to go get a diapie out of her room and she ignored me so I told her 2 more times to go get it and looks at me and says 'alright alright already geez!' And went to her room and came back with a pull up on. It was so funny and cute.|`|dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	Shortly after my trucker brother was here for a visit.....  My daughter- 2 at the time was standing on a chair looking out the window at a freak snow storm.  There were big gobs of snow falling from the sky.  Her eyes got BIG and she shook her head and said  .......HO....LEEEEE....$HIT!!! <br>  <br>   (That got my attention)  so I asked her "What did you say?" <br>  <br>   dumb question on my part, I KNEW what she said! <br>  <br>   but she said it again. <br>     I said "No, honey,  you mean Holy Cow!" <br>  <br>  she then turned back to the window and said,  Holy Cow $hit!<br>  <br>  I had to just turn and walk away,  I have laughed about this for years,  she is now 11|`|2fB383F2aa	My dog was annoying my 2 year old daughter today putting his head under her hand so she'd pet him. So she grabs his toy throws it and says "away man.. annoy!" Lol I know she gets it from me, because when my husband is bugging me I'll snap "go away, you're annoying".|`|09061e5674207e8f8a877ca8a18d54f5aa	Well my son is 5 years old and the other day hey was doing something out of the ordinary and says..".Holy Moly Cow " instead of Holy Cow...where he got it from i really dont know...lmao|`|aLHNF9peaa	My 22 month old said "call nannerpuss nannerpuss" because of that Denny's commercial that has been on with the banana octopus on top of the stack of pancakes. She loves that commercial.|`|XQe8rlH7aa	My girls are always doing and saying something that is HILARIOUS!<br>  <br>  One that sticks out is when I had my third daugher and my older two came to the hospital to see me.  I picked up the baby and began nursing her when my second child, Sweet Pea, looked mortified and asked "What are you doing?!", I explained to her that I am breast feeding and this is how the baby is going to get her milk.  She looked puzzled for a moment and then asked "Is there apple juice in the other one?"  Everyone in the room fell out laughing....|`|OIS808Qmaa	My four year old was walking out the back door with my stepfather a few months ago, and he was pushing something out of her way so she didn't trip.  She looked up at him and calmy said, "What the hell are you doing?"  Of course he was stunned, and asked her what she just said, to which she replied with an innocent smile "I said what are you doing?"<br>  Kid really are so funny!!|`|5736b4e8ea75cd3af0e7e4c6e743d45baa	My six year old daughter is a hoot.  We were eating out at a chinese restauraunt and a black guy walks in she says "look mom, it's our president" I about died.  We live in a 95% white population. We had a talk when we got home.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	My daughter isn't born yet, but last time I was at my brother's house, my niece was acting up (shes 3) and he told her to go to her room so she says "this is ridiculous" and stomps off.<br>  It was cute hah|`|3F8f1SoQaa	my 3 year old about made me pee my pants last week. He went to the bathroom and then we went out on the porch to wait for his schoolbus ( he is in special needs preschool). as we are standing there he is fidgeting and trying to pull at the seat of his pants, but cannot reach because of his heavy winter coat and his backpack. Just minutes before his bus comes he looks at me and says "mom, can you pull my pants out?" so I look at him and say "uh, sure honey...out of where". He looks at me and says "my BUTT silly"... as soon as I stopped laughing I checked and he had a full cheek hanging out with the leg seam firmly wedged in his butt crack.
D0y3MwDcaa	Jadynn Alexis is really cute(:<br>  <br>  LOVE the spelling by the way(:!|`|tZt7fUYYaa	Safia Rose|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I really do not like Kensington as a name, if it used, it should be on a pet<br>  <br>  Jadynn, how would you say that?  Is it suppose to be Jaden or Jaelyn?  It look like you could not decided in the to.  If it Jaden, it's a very common boys name, in the top 100 twice<br>  <br>  Cadence Blair are okay<br>  <br>  Suggestions<br>  Emerson Reese<br>  Zayley Alexis<br>  Fallon Bindi<br>  Jana Breese<br>  Ainsley Reese|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	hmmmm i don't like plain names either, but Bair and Alexis seem kinda plain to me.  Jadynn no matter how u spell it is becoming very popular now and alot of people are using it.  Cadence is pretty though.  Kensington Reese however is very pretty and I think its my favorite from your list.  Yet, her nickname would be Kenzie which is VERY common these days so I don't know.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I'm really sorry but they are just not my favorites. They definitely aren't plain, but Jadynn and Cadence are quite trendy at the moment and I just don't really like Kensington.<br>  <br>  Some suggestions:<br>  Kensey<br>  Kinsley <br>  Jacelyn (jase-lynn)<br>  Carsyn<br>  Arden<br>  Adelle<br>  Arley<br>  Rowan|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	I like Jadynn Reese or Jadynn Blair, myself.  <br>  <br>  Kensington sounds like a gun.  Cadence sounds like a march. <br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!|`|AA10972366	Jadynn Alexis<br>  Cadence Blair<br>  <br>  I also like Jadynn Reese<br>  <br>  But i dislike the name Kensington.|`|yv94euDBaa	Kensington is definatly a last name. Reese reminds me of Reese cups. Jadynn looks like a computer code, and Alexis is overused, and common.<br>  <br>  The only name I see have suitable for a name is possibly Cadence Blair, but that's only because I love the names Blaire and Blythe.<br>  <br>  What about:<br>  <br>  Caroline Blair?<br>  or<br>  Candace Blair?<br>  <br>  As for the others, i'd change them to:<br>  Keelie Regina<br>  Jane Astrid<br>  Caroline Blair|`|61NKzPzMaa	Eww I'm not even going to bother. Those names are awful.<br>  <br>  The best one is Reese except that's a masculine BOYS name. Not girly, feminine or unisex.<br>  <br>  Er yeah I have heard of Reese Witherspoon. Just because her parents gave her the masculine BOYS name Reese doesn't make it feminine, girly or unisex. It's originally a boys name and always will be a boys name|`|MGOFjVnVaa	i would not give my daughter the name of gardens in london,<br>  kids would never stop teasing her with this name.<br>  exotic names may be fine, but do they fit with the surname?<br>  will they still fit, when she is grown up?<br>  try to ask yourself, what names your daughter would like to<br>  have.|`|xCeaVqItaa	I love your names. Jadynn isn't my favorite though. <br>  What about:<br>  Kenadie, Adalyn, Meredith, Adrienne, Keelie, Harper, Quinn, Bridget, Willow.|`|E8kzNG3iaa	My favourite is Jadynn Reese. (Although I think Jaidyn looks prettier)<br>  <br>  Personally I think Kensington Reese sounds like a brand of appliances.|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Not really my style.  I think Jade, Alexis or Cadence would be OK as first names.<br>  <br>  Jade Alexis would be nice or Cadence Blair is OK too.|`|HWNSm9hzaa	I really like the first two names. not so much the third.|`|guVczXfUaa	I love Kensington, as long as you don't mind it being shortened to Kenzie (which WILL happen, whether you like it or not)  Reese is a great middle name for it.  :)<br>  Jaden is a boy name, and I think it's too new of a name to go cross gender with it yet.  I really like unusual cross gender names, like Jacob, Daniel, or Zachariah.  But that's just me.  Alexis works just fine as a middle name, but I think it's getting a bit too common for a first name.<br>  I do not like Cadence or Blair at all.|`|3S2gw8D1aa	My favorite is Cadence, I love this name, so very pretty and not too popular (at least where I live). I really don't like Blair paired with it though, there's nothing really wrong with it, it's just not my style. Jadynn Alexis is nice, I know three little boys named Jayden, so to me this is more masculine. Kensington Reese flows very well and I like that it's a strong name. Kensington is obviously a long name, but using Kensie as a nickname would be cute. Middle names are hard to pick, what about these for Cadence?<br>  Cadence Eve<br>  Cadence Avery<br>  Cadence Maeve<br>  Cadence Juliet<br>  Cadence Shyanne<br>  Cadence Sienna<br>  Cadence Sierra<br>  Cadence Eden<br>  Cadence Ruby<br>  Cadence Faith<br>  Cadence Arabelle<br>  Cadence Lily<br>  Cadence Noel<br>  Cadence Reagan<br>  Cadence Morgan<br>  Cadence Aveline<br>  Cadence Angeline<br>  Best of luck to you!|`|6VR19YQWaa	I think that those would end up  being a mouthful..and most would give them a nick name....cady....candy....kensi...that kind of thing. I personally named my children things that are less likely to be turned into a nick name. <br>  A little tip. I used the map for a baby name book.<br>  It's amazing the names you can come up with from there that are never considered for names.<br>  I have three kids, all named from towns in the us....i'm considering Eden for the next one.<br>  I have Kynsley (from Kansas) Dayton ( primarily from Ohio, but other states too) and Makenna (Washington state and Hawaii)<br>  Kinsely is becomming fairly popular around here..not sure if i'ts because they've met mine who is a senior in high school  and works at a popular food joint or what.|`|t0WCS6ewaa	Love Kensington and Blair, I like Reese, Jadynn and Alexis but they are a little to common for me already.

AA10196172	I think this is a pretty good way to handle the situation. At least the mother was informed in a situation where someone else was present, so she could digest the news without flying off the handle too badly. Also good that you took the decision out of her hands - obviously she was unable to get it done herself.<br>  <br>  I give you credit for stepping in and taking charge, instead of ignoring the situation. Just be sure the girl understands that if there's a problem and she doesn't want to talk to her mom, she can come and ask you about it first if she wants - but if it's something important that her parents have to know,  you can't keep it secret from them. Tell her, she can always come to your place if she needs some help or advice or whatever (but she can't move in). Maybe it will do you daughter good to see directly the kind of problems teens can get into.... maybe it won't. <br>  <br>  Hmmm... October? 4 months and she's just doing the test now? How clueless or in denial are some kids? A 14yo is probably starting to show by now.<br>  <br>  The mother seems equally messed up. Maybe she's just territorial - it's my kid, she should have come to me. Some people attack first, ask questions later. Shouldn't have bought the kit? I guess if it's not confirmed yet, it's not a problem.  Well, I guess you know now where her daughter learned to be in denial for four months.<br>  <br>  I don't know what else you could have done. It was something that needed to be done, the sooner the better. Adults, unlike kids, can't be a buddy and keep secrets for someone else's child when it's something really serious that has to be faced.<br>  <br>  So, good for you!|`|HSUfe3m7aa	I think you absolutely did the right thing and gave the girl a safe adult to talk to. The mother is angry because her baby is pregnant and didn't trust her Mom enough to confide in her.|`|WI5KmVRdaa	i think you did the right thing by telling her mom if you didn't she might not have and then the baby would be at risk i know the other mother is mad but in the long run she will thank you|`|SWOeg0jFaa	Not at all! You were being the responsible adult, her mother is just in a state of panic and looking to put the blame on someone other than her daughter.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	her mom just wants someone to blame if it wasnt you it would be the father of the baby. just dont worry so much it isnt your problem anymore.|`|hswTS1jVaa	You did the right thing.  She needed to be told.  <br>  <br>  The mom is just upset and angry at her daughter and took it out on you.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	what u did was right, but I think her mother would have liked to hear it from the daughter... I think u should have had her mother over and had her tell her, and u could have sat along for support. But Im sure the mother is just angry because u knew before her and she was shocked to hear her baby was pregnant.|`|tWKZVDG2aa	The Mother probably feels a bit dejected that you found out before her and may feel like a bad mother or something because she is pregnant at such a young age.<br>  <br>  I think you did the right thing.  Hopefully in time she'll forgive you, after the baby is born or the abortion has happened or adopted.  And as long as your daughters stay close, that's what matters isn't it?<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it :)|`|1enIWBGnaa	The girl needs to talk to her mother and tell her exactly who bought the kit.<br>  Put yourself in the girl's mother's shoes - how would you feel if this happened to your daughter at her friend's house..... you'd probably feel the same way until you found out exactly who bought the kit.|`|1MEnCmwoaa	No, she was just upset and would have yelled at anyone for any reason.<br>  You told her right away as soon as you found out, so there wasn't much more you could do. If she got pregnant in October she really needs to go to the Dr! that is when i got pregnant and i am 20 weeks along already.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	I don't think you overstepped your boundaries in the least bit. You didn't buy her the pregnancy test and you definitely didn't try to hide the information from her.<br>  <br>  She just wants to displace the blame.<br>  <br>  You did the right thing.|`|HZ7CNcbWaa	You did awesome. The world needs more people as caring, judicious and thoughtful as you.  I hope that in a similar situation I would have acted in the same way.|`|7BaHGMEyaa	yeah you did the right thing her daughter obviously trusts you and your daughter more than her own mother her mother is looking to blame someone for whats happened to her daughter.|`|V3NQKYzdaa	It sounds to me like you did the right thing, but that girls mother was upset so she might have be lashing out at you. At least she knows now and can help her daughter.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	yup you did it great well done :D|`|OuuYoSBeaa	you did the right thing and the mother was probebly jumping to conclusions in the panic of the moment. dont worry about it... what you can do to make yourself feel better, is phone the mother in a couple days and have another conversation... explain to her your position in what happend and she may come to understand and issue an apology....if not then oh well, you did your part... just make sure that your daughters friend knows she can come to you if need be if she dosnt get the support at home.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	It's a really difficult dilemma.  My 14 yo daughter's friend did the same thing to me.  I, however, told her that either she told her mom or I would, and that if I did, her mother would be even more upset with her.  She told her mother.  I still don't know if I would have told.<br>  <br>  The truth is, I have a policy that I only tell a parent about something their child has done/is doing is if someone is going to be physically harmed as a consequence of the actions.  I was burned pretty badly once when I told another mom that I witnessed her child driving her car at high speed down the wrong side of the road.  It was her first child, and he denied it.  She believed him, being naive to the huge amount of things teenagers will typically lie about to stay out of trouble.  Ten years later she still won't forgive me.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Her mom is just looking for a place to displace the blame. You did nothing wrong. I wouldn't worry.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i think what you did was just right. obviously the other mom is going to be very upset and wants to be mad at someone. and she probably did think you bought her daughter the prego test but since you explained hopefully she wont stay upset with you. im sure she will want to know everything about what happened and ask her daughter who will tell her the whole story. at least you care!|`|hstwNjNaaa	You handled it well, she needed to talk to an adult and needed you to reassure her that her Mum needed to know. She must have been angry about her daughter being pregnant and just assumed you had got her a test because she's so young, and doesn't think her daughter is mature enough to even be pregnant let alone get the test.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	I don't think you could have done anything better. You made sure that right after you found out, her mother did. Her mom was probably just in shock, and upset that her little girl is pregnant.

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	My daughter isn't a baby, but is 2 1/2 - but the one thing she does that I wish she wouldn't is pull out her own hair. A few strands here, a few there, and then she eats it! It's fairly common for kids her age, apparently, and our ped wasn't concerned. But I just wish she wouldn't. She does it when she's bored, tired, stressed (which happens a lot when you're 2 1/2 and everything is a super big deal LOL).

She's been like this for 3 months now. It is a constant struggle to get her to even drink 4oz. I have to find all sorts of way to get her to drink. I put the bottle in her cereal. I put it in a sippy cup and give her sips all day. Its very exhausting. She loves her solids but I know that she needs the bottle for the minerals and vitamins. I noticed she doesn't like to drink period.

kuIVIy57aa	I'm not sure about the ovulation, but I can tell you this: go to your pharmacist and ask for a bottle of Lydia Pinkum. I have had many friends use this to conceive with excellent results!! Good Luck to you!
El65sns4aa	Well obviously spanking doesn't work. I'm NOT against spanking (Don't CARE WHAT AMERICA SAYS!) But obviously your son has greater problems than a spank can resolve. Of course he is jealous of his new baby brother. That's SO obvious. You are rarely there and can't provide him with the attention he needs. The baby is more needy so you have to do more things for him. Based on your story and the way of the world, it's not 100% your fault. If you haven't already, take his butt to chuckie cheese or something 1 a month. Just you and him. No baby, no Dad.HIGHLY reward him when he does something nice. I mean HIGHLY. Like over the top, but please be real as you can be because he can sense sarcasm.<br>  <br>  I know tv is our number 1 baby sitter nowadays, but you gotta cut the tv off. Finger paint. Now remember, he may do something "dumb" that might piss you off while finger painting, but please say "Hey, that's not nice!" and keep painting. Don't threaten him. Don't warn him. If he does it again, then say, okay you aren't listening to mommy and it's making me upset. I think we have to put this away for another day. Okay it sounds a lil corny but try it your way feel me? Have a firm tone, but don't yell.Once he knows he got to you its on!  If he does it again, clean up. If he runs away screaming let him. As long as he isn't headed towards the baby. Finish cleaning. Sit his butt in the room/corner (not that he's gonna stay) and tell him 3 minutes. Don't say a word. When you go back, if he's still there and hasn't done something worse to piss you off, explain to him why you put him on time out. Girl, patience is the key and i am not one to talk! lol. I have 3-year-old step daughter. She's not bad, but mouthy and manipulative and it drives me NUTS NUTS NUTS! I firmly tell her to stop and she seems to listen to me more than any other family member. But the mouth is somehting i can't tolerate because my own 9 year has NEVER mouthed back tome or caused me ANY problems. HA i was lucky....for now...maybe i'll get it when she's a teen! lol<br>  <br>  Good luck. But please try to solve this yourself by showing him more attention and rewarding him to build his confidence. Don't let these dumbass doctors drug your child into another statistic! Please!1!<br>  <br>  QUICK EDIT - GIRL you need to stop typing all of your problems on yahoo answers. Some are okay but on your down time don't consume yourself with your problems. Try to relax man! Relax!!!! if you were closer i would have a mommy date with you! take em all to the park lmao!|`|0VJE7BXmaa	It sounds like you're trying to do way too much.  You are working 2 jobs and you have 2 young children?  What is wrong with the place you are at?  Why don't you just work the minimum that you need and not worry about saving for a better place.  Where are the kids when you are working?  Are they in daycare?  The kid is crying out for attention.  He needs your attention more than a better place to live.  And whoever is watching him when you work needs to be a consistent and loving care provider who is not in charge of more than 3 or 4 children.  Can you tell us a little more about your child's day to day situation if you are working so much?  Maybe we can come up with some real solutions to this problem.  I'm sure you probably can't afford to get a child psychologist.  However, look up First Steps for your state.  Until a child is 3, you can have FREE help.  Your child will be evaluated, and if he has any developmental delays he will be set up with a therapist.  Its worth a try.  He might have a slight cognitive delay (if he doesn't seem to understand there are consequences for his behavior).  I'm assuming you are giving him consequences for his behavior to teach him what is acceptable. (Consequences: firm no, quick spank, short time out, etc.).  If you are not giving some kind of consequence when he misbehaves, start now!  And don't give him too much attention when you do it, do it quickly and then give all your attention to the baby.  Believe me, if its just for attention, he will find a new way to get attention, because now, he will realize, hey when i hit the baby, mommy gives the baby even more attention and I get left over here in timeout.  When you are with him and not working, give him a lot of attention, try having him help with chores, etc (I know you said you already do that, but just a thought.)|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Well first of all....why do you think you're a bad mother?? You're doing all you can to keep things together and take care of everything....you do not sound like a bad mother to me. I really think you should talk to a child psychologist. There could be something going on. Not to say that there is, but it would be worth looking into.  You're clearly going through a rough time right now, and chances are he can tell. Children acting out is normal, but you're right, this anger and aggression is going too far. I wish I had more to say, but really you should talk to a professional. You're doing all you can. Don't beat yourself up!|`|1enIWBGnaa	Sounds like your older son is extremely jealous and needs a 'food' change.  Feed him only healthy foods; no junk foods and no sweets (including sodas).<br>  Keep the two kids separeated until the youngest one cuts all of his teeth.<br>  Give your oldest son chores to do to keep him busy.  Once the baby is down for a nap - use this time for 'one-on-one' play time with the oldest one.<br>  Continue with the discipline because he needs to realize he's not the only child and he needs to pay for his bad behavior.|`|HdOVYIWjaa	You're not a bad mother at all.  It seems that you are doing all that you can to help the situation.  I believe that spanking is OK, obviously not beating.  You should definitely take your son to a child psychologist to have some tests done to make sure there is not an underlying reason for his behaviors.  It could simply be that he is jealous of his new sibling, older children tend to be jealous because a lot of their time with mommy and daddy has been given to their new brother/sister.  I hope everything works out for you, you are doing the right thing by looking for help.  You might want to try art therapy or something, a child can use art to express his emotions and release angers and stress.|`|KmC0K59taa	You need to consult a child psychologist.  If this continues to go on, your son can seriously injure your younger child or some other child.  He needs help right away.  <br>  <br>  In the mean time, keep him away from the baby!  Do not let him in the room alone with the baby, especially when you are asleep.  I would make the baby sleep with you in your bed.
AA11903503	Absolutely have someone else give it to her. My 8 week old will not take the bottle if he can hear or see me.<br>  We have a ritual of sorts, or a routine. Dad always gives a bottle or his feeding at our dinner time. Baby can smell the cooking in the air, I am no where to be found cause I am busy, and he seems to take it very well.<br>  He gets one bottle a day (unless Mommy is very sleepy) and so long as we do it around the same time each day or follow a routine he doesn't have a problem taking it.|`|vue9NOhYaa	How old is she?  Has been taking the bottle for a while and now won't anymore? <br>  <br>  Babies are smart.  They know where the good stuff comes from, and so most breastfed babies will NOT take a bottle from mom.  If it's important that baby take the occassional bottle, have someone else offer it. (Daddy or grandma or the sitter  -- you need to be completely out of the room.)<br>  <br>  You may also have to try different bottles and different nipples, and have the person offering the bottle try holding her in different ways. (She may, for example, be more willing if NOT held in a normal 'nursing' position.)  Once you get to where she takes it, be sure to offer at least 1-2 times a week, even if not strictly necessary, so she doesn't forget.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	have some one else feed her <br>  feed her when she is HUNGRY <br>  try a diffrent bottle <br>  rub the bottle on your boobs so it smells like u|`|6vdSFw5Jaa	Unless she is very proficient at breastfeeding (over 3 months) I wouldn't confuse her by switching back and forth. I would either strictly breastfeed her or bottle feed her. But, if you insist here are some tips:<br>  <br>  Still hold her close to your bare chest as if you were going to breast feed her. She may be wanting that same closeness.<br>  <br>  Try many different nipples. Avent and Playtex (disposable) are supposed to the be the closest to the breast, but my sister (who switched) just used the regular long tan rubber nipples on regular bottle. Make sure you check the flow of the nipples.<br>  <br>  Be patient. You can't expect an easy change if she has been exclusively breast feed. But, what ever you decide to do, stick with it. Changing it constantly will only confuse her more.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Use a cup, not a bottle.  Or if you can find one a paladai (a kind of milk-feeding cup for babies)<br>  <br>  Even a newborn can drink from a cup, this is one of the methods used for newborns that need supplements. (or usually don't but moms are told they do).  From 4 months most babies can cup feed themselves.  Paladais in particular use the same tongue motion to get the milk as breastfeeding.  The key to cup feeding is to tilt the cup until the milk is at baby's lip, but not to pour it into baby's mouth.  They will lap up or suck the milk depending on the baby.<br>  <br>  Unlike a bottle cup feeding won't cause nipple confusion, won't increase the risks of ear infections, isn't as high a risk for overfeeding, and is more sanitary (cups are far easier to clean).<br>  <br>  Alternative Feeding Methods<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/alternative-feeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/alter...</a><br>  <br>  How to bottle-feed the breastfed baby<br>  ...tips for a breastfeeding supportive style of bottle feeding<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/bottle-feeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/bottl...</a>|`|MtC3CWZraa	I third that you can't be the one to give her the bottle at first.

We chop up veggies, steam them, mash them, sometimes add them to spaghetti sauces!  We even do veggie pizzas.<br>  <br>  Another tricky way to get in the veggies is to puree something like zucchini, carrots or even cauliflower and add it to your..... cookies!  Or cakes, or brownies!  I do it all the time and my toddler never knows!  It also works for persnickety husbands too, lol.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I am very rarely sneaky, I prefer to have the kids actually eat fruits and veggies and know and enjoy it.  (call me lazy or stubborn, but going through a bunch of trouble to sneak in nutrition just seems like way to much work).  Besides, my husband loves cooking and can almost always tell if if I use an odd ingredient!  I do try to sneak in low fat versions of somethings, but if he sees the label, you can forget it!!!!<br>  <br>  Lately the kids and I will discuss certain fruits and veggies and what good vitamins or minerals they have in them.  I also talk about protein in the eggs or meat and how it's good for their brains right before school.  I want them to value what they are eating not only for the taste but for what it can do for their bodies.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I did both of these. Also, slip spinach into lasagne as a layer mixed with the cottage cheese. Cooking onions til they are transparent and adding to most everything, like stews and casseroles. Spaghetti squash is wonderful (never told him it was a veggie). Add veggies to cheese biscuits (onions, spinach, peppers). <br>  Best thing of all was to read the book "Stone Soup" and he was so excited to follow the directions, he's loved veggie soup ever since!<br>  Then, we would try unusual vegetables, looking for them in the grocery store. Now he loves things like eggplant and asparagus.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Well, mine is only 5 1/2 months old. But, he HATES veggies, sweet peas, green beans....nope, not for him. But he has to eat veggies, he can't have the sweet stuff all the time. So, I kind of have to mix squash with applesauce, or bananas with a little bit of peas mixed in or something. He never knows. Usually I will give one bite of applesauce then 2 bites of peas or something. By the time he realizes I gave him to much peas he gets more sweet stuff.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I put it on their plates and say eat it.|`|n2Jromq6aa	That's pretty creative! It can be tough when you have a picky eater (my best friends daughter won't try any veggies, but I think I'll suggest she try those sloppy joes of yours!)<br>  <br>  I'm personally a vegetarian, so I'm always making tons of different veggies for my family. My youngest isn't on solids yet, but my older one loves helping mommy with the veggies and trying new things so I guess I'm one of the lucky ones!<br>  <br>  One thing that I've noticed is that if you make things fun and get the kids involved in helping with the food they are much more ecited to eat it--for example, my daughter loves purple potatoes because of they're purple! She loves showing her friends her "purple fries" and "purple mashed potatoes" Lol|`|AA12145826	I got a recipe from Rachel Ray that works like a charm....honestly some day Hannah will be mad at me for telling her that its "Super Hero Pasta" when really its pasta made with a sauce of yellow beets & ricotta cheese.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Honestly though...I rarely have to sneak them in anywhere. She eats most veggies freely. Only kid I've ever known to prefer a side salad to french fries. My biggest thing is that I have to tell her pork is chicken because she's been a little sensitive about eating any pig products since she saw (and I subsequently read) Charlotte's Web.|`|0QYIbn1saa	The "Deceptively Delicious" cookbook my husband bought recently does the trick!!!!!!!! (it's written by Jessican Seinfeld)<br>  <br>  Last night we made blueberry oatmeal bars...they were delicious....and had 1/2 cup of pureed spinich that you would NEVER know was in there unless we told you!<br>  <br>  This is a fantastic cookbook for ultra healthy food sneaky-ness!!! (And it tastes good to adults, also!)  We make recipes from this book regularly.|`|JivuAmfiaa	I do it all the time, I'll process the veggies and then add it to foods like you do. We do a lot of home-cooking and I often add the veg to burgers or sauce, my daughter sometimes sees me do this so I tell it's "taste-good magic syrup" and she eats it all up! Interesting question!|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	Shred carrots in baked mac/cheese<br>  Casseroles with veggies tend to be hidden well|`|9scpRClxaa	Tried it.

Good idea though!!!|`|vhMe2oCGaa	I made a deal with my kids that every month they can choose one thing or one colour that they do not have to eat everything else the have to eat or at least try it has worked really well for the past year. <br>  I also give there dinner to them on a big plate so it doesn't look like that much compared to dads this was a trick i learn't at college (im a Psychologist) because when its on a smaller the plate the portions look A lot bigger than on a bigger plate this way their brain doesn't turn shut off at the pure site of a HUGE plate ofbroccolii.<br>  i find this i find these both really useful .<br>  good luck and i hope this helped|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I am super super lucky that my daughter LOVES veggies and fruit and only when shes not feeling well does she turn it down. My Grandmother in law does one thing that I love veggie wise. She adds shredded carrots to orange jello and its really good lol. Other then that I do add veggies so my husband eats them lol. Spinach in the lasagna, broccoli and cauliflower to the Alfredo sauce. When I make fried rice I put carrots and peas in that. I slip some in my meat loaf sometimes.|`|4WVUBnA6aa	My Mom used to make zucchini bread that was so sweet it tasted almost like a cake... she convinced me it was nut cake for years.

OBU1eDUHaa	I had the Mirena after my son was born.  I bled for about 1 hour after wards and never had a period the entire time it was in (about 11 months).  The only thing that was a problem was that my husband said he could feel the strings.  However, my MD said if that did happen she could just shorten them real quick, but we decided to try for baby # 2 instead!  I liked it just fine.  Since baby #2 is  3 1/2 months I am going to get it put in again!|`|3LY9PtPLaa	I have been on so many differnt kinds of BC...and I HIGHLY recommend mirena.  The insertion is NOT THAT BAD....it 3 bad cramps..they will tell you when they are coming, and I didn't bleed at all after I got it put in, maybe spotted for a day. Then I got my period for maybe 3 months normal time, and it was super light, then finally I stopped getting my period. It was wonderful, and you don't even know its there, so no more scares, (well for me, I was horrible at taking a pill every day) I had something wrong cuz i was cramping really bad and bleeding for 3 months (it WAS NOT the IUD, it was endometriosis) the DR asked me if I wanted it removed (after 3 years) in case that was the problem (this was before the diagnosis) They took it out and it wasnt the problem, but I have been BEGGING for it back and as soon as I get home from deployment will get RIGHT BACK ON IT!! It was WONDERFUL!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I have the mirena, and I am becoming more skepitical over time.<br>  But It hurt like really bad cramping whne they put it in. <br>  I do not get my period which i love.<br>  <br>  I have had it for a good amount of time now..since the summer maybe?<br>  I did have on and off bleeding after they put it in.<br>  The only problems I have with it are when I was to have sex, he could feel it, even after they made it shorter because he could feel it before too.<br>  And after I would have sex, I would bleed. Like spotting all over again just after sex every time, sometime worse than others.|`|28QPS6V9aa	I have several friends who are on Mirena and they all speak very highly of it. Most of them have been on it for at least a year and still haven't had any problems with it. After my baby is born, I plan on going on Mirena. From what my friends have told me, the insertion doesn't hurt. I've tried a few other birth controls such as depo provera and the pill and I wasn't impressed with either of them. I would try Mirena!|`|xT4pJ56maa	I could feel it all the time, my husband got poked during sex, made my periods crazy, hurt me during sex, and I got pregnant and lost a baby on it. I wouldnt get it. Plus it makes it really hard to try to get prego after getting it out.|`|4hzUOmEOaa	I have the Mirena and I love it!! They put it in and you have nothing to worry about!! I wasnt on my period and I got it my son is 5months old but I think it depends on the doctor. because i knowsome doctors like you to be on it ....|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, you will probably bleed for a while after it's  inserted. (And you'll have some discomfort or pain DURING the insertion. I'd recommend taking a couple of Advil before you go in.)<br>  <br>  Not having had a period should not be a problem, though they will do a pregnancy test to be sure you aren't pregnant.<br>  <br>  The Mirena is a great method.  Most women who have it, love it. Significant side effects are rare, it's VERY effective, compatable with breastfeeding, and you don't have to think about or DO anything once it's in place. OTOH, if you do have bad side effects, or plan to get pregnant again within a year or so, and so have to have it removed -- you're out quite a bit of money. <br>  <br>  If you do plan to get pregnant again soon, or just dont' want to use it (or the doc won't do it for some reason) --- you might consider the mini-pill (I assume you're breastfeeding), or just good old condoms. <br>  <br>  Oh -- one thing to be aware of.  IF you are of the personal belief that life begins at conception, and that anything that might keep a fertilzed egg from implanting is an 'abortificant' -- this is not a good method for you. While it primarily works by killing sperm on the way in, it also alters the uterine lining so if an egg IS fertilized, it won't implant. So, if this would go against your morals, don't get it.  (Your options in that situation are pretty much limited to condoms, LAM or Natural Family Planning.)|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i have it and i love inseting it feels like a little pinch and there is slight cramping <br>  you do bleed for about a month plus but not very heavily <br>  it is the easiest form of bc and the safest if u want future children <br>  i suggest getting this <br>  and yes u still get a period but its shorter lighter and less cramping <br>  <br>  <br>  yay!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I have Paragard, the copper IUD. Mirena is the hormone IUD. They are similar in size and shape, just Paragard has no hormones in it and it lasts for 10 years. I thought about Mirena but I didn't want any other hormones in my body except my own. Paragard will make your first couple of periods heavier but that goes away and you have your own period and not a hormone generated one. I love it and I recommend it to everyone! They recommend putting it in during a period though since the cervix is softer. You Doctor might want to wait until the first period to put in both Paragard or Mirena.|`|vjsT8DMIaa	I got the Implanon back in Jan. Its a think flexible rod about the size of a matchstick..they numb a little area of your arm, under your bicep....make a small incision, and insert the rod. For me, its been great. I have had no hormonal side effects, no cramping....the only thing I have experienced is slight spotting off and on. Which is normal if you choose to get the mirena also. They cause spotting because they are progesterone only, which change the lining of your uterus. Its good for 3 years and I love not having to take a pill everyday.<br>  I've heard too many horror stories about the mirena made me not get it. The bad stories were more than the good stories.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I have the Mirena and I LOVE it!! I have had it for almost 4 years now (wow! lol) and I haven't gotten my period back at all, no spot bleeding, no nothing! I did bleed when they put it in, not heavy, and only for about 4 hours. I had to go back in and have the wires trimmed because my boyfriend said he could feel them, but that wasn't a big deal. Other than that, I have no complaints!!|`|QVg9KB1vaa	I have mirena and i like it just fine.
uuHPneEcaa	I don't think they should be aloud to go out. Yeah it was unwanted but then u shouldn't depend on ur parents to watch ur child while u go out and PARTY... yeah its okay on some occasions. but not all the time. I know this girl who is 15 years old, just had her baby and 2 days later she was back on the streets. i don't agree with that at all.. BUT its up to their parents really.. I am 21 years old, and after I have my son I don't think I will be just leavin my some wit his grandparents just so i can go out and have fun. I am goin to stay and handle my resposibilty.<br>  <br>  I found out I was pregnant 6 days before my 21st birthday, I didn't go out and party on my birthday..I don't think teen mothers should be able to do much. UNLESS THEY HAVE A JOB then maybe its okay, for the parents to watch the baby but other then that. I don't agree with it at all.. Their life is over to me.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	okay when you tac on the leave them with there parents... i hate girls who do that! it give the rest of us teenage mothers a bad name! its horrible especially when they claim to be better parents then you. it also gets looks form people when you go out every once in a blue moon to just go to the mall or for a walk because everyone assumes the teen mom is always going out! its not fair to the parents either, they've already taken care of their kids.  honestly... i hate them. you get pregnant you keep it so you look after it. end of story. my mom take him once in a while and i stay home and clean or go to the doctor or go do things i need to do for all of us.<br>  <br>  i knew a girl like that.. left her two month old son with her mother (who lost her to social services) and went off to a town two hours away on a bus and was gone for three days!  she honestly had the nerve to say she knew more and was a better mother cause she had been one longer! i was SO temped to tell her off and just say "no because i've spent more time taking care of my baby!"|`|a6e7SRYzaa	This one hits an extremely emotional nerve for me. I knew a girl who was one of my good friends, but dated pure trash. Well she ended up pregnant and decided to keep the baby. During the entire pregnancy went to parties and even had the nerve when her parents left town to have parties. She found out that my husband and I were trying to have children, but due to health issues I will probably never be able to carry a baby to full term. She said who cares, just adopt a baby or something being pregnant is stupid and it sucks, and that it didn't really matter for me anyways if I can get pregnant. Since that point I haven't spoked to her, but I know her parents are raising the baby and she just parties all the time.  So my answer is I think they are pathetic people who have serious issues.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	pple like them discust me ... theres this chick i know who still goes to parties while pregnant and even smokes weed! i think its just wrong!|`|f0dnVAW7aa	I really dislike the fact that just anyone can get pregnant. It hardly seems fair to that poor child. Not all teens are irresponsible but from my point of view.. it's not the responsible ones that get pregnant. <br>  <br>  A friend of my nephews is pregnant. She is 15, she drinks, she smokes, not an eager student but intends to graduate - and now she is going to be a mother! He says people congratulate her and ask her all about it (which is very friendly to do of course) but how can they think this is alright.<br>  <br>  When she found out I am sure that she wasn't thrilled.. (or maybe she was - I don't know). She is going to be pregnant throughout the summer.. she doesn't give a thought to how difficult labour is going to be. What about waking up in the middle of the night to feed, expenses - so much that a 15 year old doesn't know. <br>  <br>  I have no doubt in my mind that HER parents will raise this child.<br>  <br>  I fear for this child, and for all other children, that have to try to persevere throughout the pregnancy and overcome the drugs and alcohol, smoke - they don't get a choice and it will affect their life forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  God Bless Their Souls.|`|mTl9l3aMaa	Irresponsible. The media encourages kids to go out and do it ASAP. Sex nowadays is treated like something casual, something for self-esteem. I think it's the kid's fault for being stupid, but much more the parent's fault.<br>  <br>  If the preggo girl keeps the child, there'll be no more parties, unless she gives it up for adoption. But she should learn to keep her legs closed after that!|`|6zPCQ7rPaa	well they shouldn't keep them even if abortion isn't an option. adoption always is. just no partying for 9 months then you are free to do whatever they want. and their parents don't have to suffer for their kids mistakes.i will be damned if my sons had kids and wanted me to watch them.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Well it's their parents fault for allowing them to do it. Thats probably how they ended up preggo in the first place, no parental guidence.|`|OpVysSzQaa	they get too much attention in the media spotlight. the more we hear about it, the more alright it becomes.|`|NNwEuC8paa	It's messed up and one day they will open there eyes and see how stupid they are.|`|07i0Xyevaa	tell them to grow up they have responsibility now and if they cant handle it place the kid in a home for someone who can|`|7kosr9mcaa	If teenagers still want to go out and party just to have their parents look after the child then that is ridiculous!! I have a friend, who is like that. She thinks she is a good mom, but I beg to differ. She hardly pays any attention to her son and she will even wake him from his sleep at night to pack him up and bring him to a friends house with her. she will put the playpen up in a different room and then party in the other room. Unless she gets her mom to babysit.<br>  <br>  I had a baby at 19, I am 20 now. I have no once gotten my mother or my fiance's mother to watch our son so we could go out and party. In fact I have never had anyone babysit for more than a few hours. Our son has only been babysat about 4 times and he is almost 1 year. I believe that it was my choice to have unprotected sex, now I must deal with the consequences. I chose to have my son and now I am choosing to raise him. I have chosen not to be friends with people who just want to party. I try to surround myself with other responsible young mothers.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	My brother was with a girl like this.  She moved in with my brother, 70 miles away from her daughter who was with her parents being raised by them.  I refuse to have anything to do with her.  She disgusted me.
IuzaNq2Uaa	I think it is increasing in popularity but won't get really super-popular in the US.<br>  <br>  It's currently very popular in Britain and New Zealand, and a top 500 name in Australia and Canada.<br>  <br>  Actress Isla Fisher is giving this name a lot of air-time at the moment, and there is a minor celebrity baby in Britain called Isla (daughter of TV actors Jamie Bamber and Kerry Norton).<br>  <br>  The US doesn't have a strong Scottish heritage like the Commonwealth countries mentioned above, so although I can definitely see Isla reaching the top 1000 in a year or so, I don't see it getting any higher than about 200-300 before its popularity wanes.<br>  <br>  That's my prediction! I might be wrong; I might be right!|`|AA10458195	I don't think it will become too popular here in the US. Scottish names<br>  are very different from the names we generally use.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Well I love the name Isla! I think it is gorgeous. I have been surprised by the frequency of which people suggest it in Yahoo answeres also, but I have yet to meet a baby named Isla.<br>  <br>  I think that because of Isla Fisher (spelling?), the movie start, the name is becoming a little more popular. Though I can't predict the future, obviously, I don't see it falling into the "trendy" category anytime soon. Ita a gorgeous name, though!|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Isla is a very pretty name. It is in the top 30 in New Zealand at the moment so I would say that it's going to turn into one of those trendy names. In America at the moment it's not that common though, just depends where you're from. If I were you I would use it :)|`|q02UN23aaa	I like it too. I like the actress (Isla Fisher) so that is where I first heard it. <br>  <br>  I don't think it is too popular and it is a really pretty name. I would use it but im sure my hubby would disapprove.|`|6Swq0iEPaa	It it a well used choice right now, but I wouldn't use it myself simply because I would feel like I was naming a piece of stranded land out in the middle of nowhere. But that's that's just me, other mothers and father may adore it|`|guVczXfUaa	I've never heard of it, but that doesn't mean it won't be really popular.  <br>  I think it's probably a fairly safe bet, even if it gets more common I doubt it will hit the epic proportions of names like Brittany, Jessica, Hailey, etc.  <br>  <br>  My mom had the same concerns when she named me, so she asked an elementary school teacher.  That helped a lot, there aren't too many girls with my name, although it's starting to get a little more popular in the generation below mine.|`|3S2gw8D1aa	The only Isla I've ever heard of is the actress Isla Fisher. I don't see this name becoming to overly popular because most people don't know how to pronounce it. I personally love this name, it's classy and not trendy at all. If you're looking for a unique name that's pretty and not too out there, then this is the perfect fit. Best of luck.|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	You never know what's going to spark a names popularity but female names in the US seem to be leaning toward the more traditional english names and the masculine turned unisex names so I wouldn't guess this would be overly popular any time soon|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I think it will become more popular as Isla Fisher becomes more famous.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Maybe, it could be. I honestly hope it doesn't when I have a baby because I'd feel bad.. But if I had three girls, my third daughter would most likely be named Isla.|`|VTkRjExmaa	i think it would not become too popular...<br>  <br>  because Isla - means Island...|`|bcb975a6a5422a999658b591957e3b9faa	i don't think its gonna be popular although i like it a lot|`|c99aa0d7f7f9c98be09c0cdfc426b916aa	It doesn't have to be popular here. Have you heard some of the goofy names people here name their children? Isla is a very pretty, unique name. I say, go with it! BTW - I LOVE the name Aiden!|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I like it. It might become popular.
KmC0K59taa	Mine is 22 months old and just recently gave up her bedtime bottle.  It was no big deal since she just had one a day.  Lots of moms I know gave them up at 12 months, but what does it hurt?  I was in no big rush to get rid of all her "baby" things at one year.<br>  <br>  Just keep introducing the sippy and she will be thirsty enough that she will drink from it.  Keep the bottle for naptime or bedtime only.  She will learn that the sippy is for breakfast and lunchtime.|`|uxItOSkmaa	Wait to stop offering them until it isn't a battle.  Let her get accustomed to the sippy cup for a while and then start decreasing the number of bottles you give her in the day.  Eventually you'll be down to 1 bottle only and it will much easier to it away.|`|AA11784984	I did it cold turkey but then my kids took to sippy cups at 6 months. Now that you have found a cup she likes only offer that to her not the bottle. It will be tough but if she wants something to drink she will give in. Staying on the bottle can effect her teeth.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Why are you allowing her to tell you what to do?  YOU are the boss - NOT her!<br>  Have her toss ALL of the baby bottles in the garbage (this way she knows they are gone), continue giving her the sippy cups and get on with your life.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	its bullshits when she is ready is when it should happen, my boy is 15months old and has three bottles a day still, and he uses a sippy cup for everythg else (water, juice). take it slow, its not worth the stress|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	I gave my daughter the sippy at 11 months. Have you tried the kind that have the soft "bottle like" spouts? They're soft and chewey like a bottle, so they worked out well for us. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|28QPS6V9aa	Not necessarily twelve months, I think they should be taken away whenever both mom and baby are ready. However, if you wait until they are two years old then I think you've waited too long. I have a big pet peeve of seeing two year old children with baby bottles. Don't cut her off cold turkey, maybe just during the day give her the sippy cup and at night give her the bottle and over the next few months gradually lose the bottle. If you guys aren't ready there's no need to rush. There aren't any rules about this stuff, so just do what feels right for you. My daughter is only eight months, and I plan on switching to sippy cup soon, but that is only because I'm about to have another baby in two months and I want her to be as independent as possible by then.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	In my own opinion in most circumstances they should be taken away at 12 month. I believe they drink formula from a bottle, and if they don't have formula they no longer have the need for a bottle. It doesn't have to be that hard of a battle. It will be hard for the first day or two. But when she gets thirsty enough she will take the cup. If she knows making a lot of noise is going to get you to give in and you give in it will just take longer. It's better for her and you to just take it away...explain to her that she is a big girl and the bottle is going bye bye. Then when she needs milk or juice or water give her the cup. I didn't have a problem at all with either of my children. I found a cup they liked and that was it. Good luck.|`|s4NCMGDeaa	My daughter is 13 months old, still give her the bottle...I only give it to her 2x though...morning and right before bed, depends on how late I feed her if I give her the bottle at night...I would do it slowly...my daughter wouldn't take a sippy until a couple of weeks ago...so do what you feel is best|`|4hzUOmEOaa	Go over to the trash can with her and tell her she is a big girl... and she has to drink out of a sippy. it works ....most of the time|`|wENdWT5kaa	There is no rules on when to take the bottle way. That is just hogwash that you have to take it away. <br>  <br>  My daughter didn't stop taking it till she was 18 months. <br>  <br>  if your daughter still wants he bottle let her have it. She may actually ween herself off it when she is ready. I wouldn't worry about it for atleast a couple more months.|`|AA11327039	My daughter didn't have her bottle taken away from her until she was 13 months and my son was almost 20 months.  Each child is different.  She won't go to kindergarten sucking on a bottle.  As long as she's getting used to drinking out of cups with straws and open cups, she'll eventually adjust just fine...besides, you'll find a day when you are just as ready to toss the bottle and it'll likely be soon.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Why will it be a long hard battle?  Take the bottle away and keep it away.  If she is thirsty she will drink from a cup with a lid.<br>  <br>  You are the adult here and there is a good, long term reason for removing the bottle.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Don't give into tantrums on ANY issue. Each time you give in to a tantrum, you teach her that throwing a tantrum works. You will only set yourself up for years and years of additional tantrums if you do this.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Yes i believe they should be taken away. The sooner the better and the easier it is. Don't give into tantrums or she will learn if i cry long enough mommy will give in.|`|ENANtueuaa	My daughter was pretty much off the bottle completely at a year...but i must admit, she did get a night bottle once in awhile until she about 15 months. I think every situation is different, and it sounds like your daughter needs a few more months with her bottle. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. Most people use 12 months as a rule of thumb, because that's usually when you stop giving them formula. If she has a speech delay, i would suggest that you don't let her walk around sucking on her bottle all day. If she needs something to drink during the day, those are times when she could use her sippy cup. Then use the bottle for more relaxing times, such as naptime or bedtime, or when she first wakes up. It just sounds like she needs the comfort of her bottle in the morning, like my daughter needed hers at night. There is no right or wrong here, and it's your choice. Good luck!

aQ8o4w3Xaa	Alright, put it this way, right NOW you think it's fine and dandy to be sleeping with your boyfriend. How will you feel in 5, 10...20 years? Will you still be as confident with your decision. Like you I first had sex when I was 13 and I thought "what's the big deal? Why do people get so fussed? Sex is sex". But now I'm 18 and I'm a completely different person. Not only do I regret sleeping with him at such a young age, but I also regret being foolish enough to think I was ready. It's only now I've found someone I REALLY love and really care about that it's all dawned on me. <br>  <br>  Of course, none of us here can stop you, but having been there done that, I would bet money that in a few years you'll live to regret it. When you find "that person" and you really fall in love with him, it'll haunt you. Just like it does me. <br>  <br>  As for the "I'm not stupid enough to get preggo" comment do you REALLY think that 99% of teens are that dumb? Condoms break, pills fail. That's a fact. You can't say 100% you won't get pregnant, you just can't. Having been "stupid enough to get pregnant" myself, I assure you that it does happen and no amount of denial or "if's and but's" will stop it. <br>  <br>  When it comes down to it, it's your decision, but please think about it. Reading your post was like listening to myself 5 years ago. I too was far too grown up for my age, or at least I thought I was. <br>  <br>  Good luck. You're the one that has to live with this.<br>  :)|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Saving your body to give away when you are in a deeply committed relationship like marriage shows that someone has a great deal of self respect.  By being easy to have sex with, having sex outside of a deeply committed relationship like marriage is like saying, hey, I'm not worth very much, you can have me without committing to love me.  You can have the goods for free, because I'm not worth much!  That is the message you are sending out to the guys when you have sex so young.  You will wander why guys treat you so bad the rest of your life.  I'm giving you a warning.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Because it's wrong.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	You could get pregnant, even if you use protection. Most of the time with teen pregnancy, it's not planned and a complete shock.|`|AA10186411	BECAUSE YOU ARE A CHILD!  Nobody said you were a whore.. You are just a child.  Anyone that will have sex with someone at that age is just disgusting.  You are too immature to deal with the emotional and physical consequences. I'm sure whatever loser you are dating sure isn't going to stick around for long since you are already giving it up.<br>  <br>  FYI- Just because you are 13 does NOT make you a teenager.  A teenager isn't because your age ends in the word teen...you are nothing but a CHILD.|`|nKSmgjylaa	The way I view it is that it's your life, not mine. It's not the place of strangers on the internet to tell you what to do.. You're sensible enough to use protection and you're in a comitted relationship. It's up to you, just be ready for a pregnancy, sooner or later it could happen. Take care. (:<br>  <br>  Edit - Sorry, I misread the q.<br>  YOU'RE 13? Do your parents know? That's sick.<br>  Children shouldn't be making children with other children. It's just wrong. Sex isn't for fun. Sex isn't for experimanting. Yes, you ARE only a teen once. You're not an adult. Don't waste your valuable years as a child doing things that only adults should do. Ugh..|`|r39EDGhPaa	Why do so many people ask this question?<br>  It's getting old.  Look it up in the search bar, its there for a reason.<br>  <br>  LOL you're not stupid enough to get yourself pregnant?  People have gotten pregnant through a condom AND birth control, and yes I mean they were using them both at the same time.  You just made yourself sound extremely ignorant.  That is exactly how my older cousin was conceived.  You're obviously not as educated about sex as you seem to think you are, and you're obviously not very mature or sensible.<br>  <br>  Just because you're "only a teen once" doesn't mean you should have sex so young.  You're hardly a teen.  You've been a teen for what.. a few months?  Lmao.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, you're horribly ignorant and I'm not going to continue with my answer because you will just report it.<br>  <br>  Toodles :)|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Because at 13 you are not emotionally mature enough to handle the ramifications of sex. You have more chance of getting pregnant, getting STD's, and being limited later in life if you get labeled as a "slut". It can affect your future education, job, marriage, and children. All stuff that seems so far away, but one wrong move could change your entire future. There is absolutely no reason to have sex at 13. Your only job at 13 is to be a kid, you have forever to be a responsible adult.|`|hswTS1jVaa	It has nothing to do with getting pregnant.  At 13 there is NO reason for you to be having sex.  You are young and don't realize the possible consequences.  Lack of sex ed is why many young girls end up pregnant, or thinking it won't happen to me.<br>  <br>  What possible reason do you have to be having sex at 13?|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	I am getting so mad at your immaturaty and ignorance I cant even to begin to explain how wrong this is. Physicaly, mentaly, Emotional, phsycologicaly, morally.<br>  <br>  I can only hope you never reproduce.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Because most are immature and not emotionally ready ready to deal with what can come with sex. A lot of people also look at statics and see the younger you are when you start the more likely to have unplanned pregnancies and a disease at some point. Although you use protection and birth control there is still no guarantee that you won't end up pregnant. Why are you having sex so young anyway? Your putting yourself out there for judgment by posting this. No one would know your age if you didn't tell them, nor would they know you are having sex. Why do you feel the need to shout to the world that you are a sexually active 13 year old when you know you will only be chastised for it?|`|9QC1MD4Naa	People have a problem with young teens having sex because most of them can't handle the consequences. Did you know that using a condom and birth control does not guarantee that you won't get pregnant? Nothing is 100%.<br>  <br>  I don't think you're a whore, I just think your not using your judgement well. And for me, it's just weird to think about, because at 13 I was NOT thinking about sex. Things are really different now.|`|WI5KmVRdaa	people look down on others that are young that have sex because they are so young there are so many young moms  out there that don't take care of their babies or kill them because they want their old life back  im a teen mom  i got preg at 16 and im 17 now and i got talked about all the time because i was so young and i didn't want to get preg i was on bc and we used protection but that doesn't always work but everyone judges because they hear so many teens are getting preg they just don't want that to happen and they're trying to prevent it|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Honestly? You are representing yourself like an ignorant child. "You are only a teen once?" So you are saying all teens should go out and have sex? No, they're not meant to. <br>  <br>  "I am not stupid enough to get pregnant," well.. little missy you need to go take some sex education courses and get familiar with this stuff because no matter what you do, how many precautions you take there will ALWAYS be a chance that you are pregnant. It isn't a matter of stupidity but science.<br>  <br>  I'm 14 and a virgin. Yes, I choose to be the way I am because I have a little something that I like to call common sense. You are a freaking child. You with your little backchatting in your additional details shows how immature and defensive you are.

Enjoy your childhood and stop acting this way.  NO teenager should have sex until they are at least 18!<br>  Besides, CHILDREN are not responsible for what could happen when having sex.  They just do it for fun and don't think about the consequences.|`|EelbVaToaa	This is what we talk about... Why do you ask why people think that teenagers should not have sex, if you have a defensive answer for everything?  <br>  <br>  As much as you do not like it, you are a CHILD.

PLEASE MATURE!!!!|`|ywlhky4uaa	Eww , people look down on you cos you ARE discusting !<br>  <br>  Too little kids trying to have sex ....<br>  <br>  Nobody here want to know what you 2 little mingers get up 2 in the bedroom ok ! god , you talk like its something to be proud off , alot of growing up 2 do !|`|dbf8Afhoaa	I agree 100000000000% with Rainbow Shoelaces.<br>  <br>  Children like you and your little boyfriend should not be having sex.|`|3oswni4Vaa	the decision to start having sex is seen as a big one and teenagers have a lot on their minds with hormone changes etc, without the added stress of having sex. Because there is an age of consent (which can vary, depending on where you are from), having sex at a younger age is actually against the law. Nearly half of British teenagers wished they had lost their virginity with someone else, and many regret losing it at a young age. People will have different opinions on this subject. I personally don't think teenagers that have sex are 'whores' but some people do because they believe teenagers aren't ready to cope with all the emotions etc that can come with having sex.<br>  I lost my virginity at 15. At the time, i felt ready but now, at 18, i wish i had waited. It depends on the individual. (and before you get defensive, that's not my way of telling you that you will regret it later on, im just saying my personal experience)|`|5jjGo6XTaa	well most people look down on teen who have sex because they are not responsibal about it. if you are thats great, but 90% are not. and 80% of teenagers who have sex do get preggers and about 60% of tennagers want to get pregnant. and the thing with all that with people looking down on them is yes it is your choice but most teenagers cant take care of their child they dont have the money to. most teens count on their parents and the govermant to help them. most teen daddies bail out cause they soon see they cant do it and most teens havent got the chance to live their lives so they still try to with the baby and the baby end up getting neglected. I am only 19 and i agree with it i also have 2 children and a step son. i dont fall under those statistics i have my children and i married their father he has a fulltime job who supports us im a stay at home mom. and my step son his is 9 years old who lives with us to. his mother does fall under those statisics because she bailed out on them when he was 2 and since the time i have been with my husband i can count on two hands how many times shes seen him and she only lives 5mins away doent work now has another child with her new bf and they r living in their friends appt and use goverments money she still hasnt gottin him his last years and this years xmas gift. to me thats not right if you have sex you should be ready to give up your life if you do get preggers most teens arnt ready if you are go for you. but you most agree and see most teens are not ready for what sex can bring. they dont thin past the pregnance part. babys grow up it take work it takes a life time. go ahead have sex but be pretected and there will be a time where you might think you in love and want a family but wait cause if you in love you love will still be there once you have finished school once you have a job and have money to take care of your child and family and so will you sex partnet so just wait to have children have sex but always use pretection children change everything. thats why people look down on teens who have sex cause they arnt ready for what it can bring. they let their ammotions get past whats reality.|`|HZ7CNcbWaa	You don't seem to be here looking for honest advice, but for opinions that justify your position.<br>  <br>  Sex is not just feel good pokey-pokey.  Sexual expression between people requires emotional and physical closeness.  Closeness means vulnerability, and being vulnerable means YOU WILL GET HURT.  For you to be emotionally harmed while still adolescent will certainly impact who you will be as an adult.<br>  <br>  You are risking one of two things:<br>  1) Being sexual without being intimate, which is imbalanced and unhealthy, and is the door to a promiscuous lifestyle.<br>  2) Exposing yourself to all the turmoil and heartrending that comes with deep emotional relationship, while not yet having all the social tools that come with a bit more maturity.<br>  <br>  Your actions and choices now will impact your relationships for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  I bet your sister is more concerned for you than disgusted.<br>  <br>  added: "You may see me as a child but I am very mature and sensible.<br>  And it is not wrong."...statements like these are clear illustrations of immaturity and irrationality.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for you because I doubt that anything anybody contributes here will inspire you take pause and think your choice over.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	Well most teens are just irresposible and i give credit to the ones that are responsible but at the same time, accidents happen and the pill is not 100% nor is condoms...Teens are not financially or emotionally capable of taking care of themself most of the time, never mind a baby. Untill you have a baby, you really have no idea the work that is required into raising the child for 18 years.<br>  Not all teens that are sexually active are "whores". You are right that there is nothing wrong with experimenting, but that chances of you spending the rest of your life with this "boy" of yours, isnt very likely. Chances are more likely to split if you fell prego.|`|eeKlogL4aa	Because no, they don't plan to get pregnant. But you know what? Birth control and condoms fail. If you keep on having sex and even though you are using protection, you could get pregnant. Or you could catch an STD. It's called consequences. These things can happen EVEN WITH PROTECTION. Please do not say you are not stupid enough to get pregnant because you use protection. <br>  People look down on young ones having sex because they are not ready for the emotional and physical affect having sex has on you. Most people who have sex at 13 regret it. You will too. Believe me.
OU9xnW86aa	Welcome to the joys of pregnancy! :)<br>  <br>  The bloating may come and go but expect to start getting bigger and bigger. I found myself maternity shopping at 12 weeks. Before that I wore belly bands so I could wear my pre-pregnancy pants unbuttoned and unzipped without being on display.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I bloated really badly with my first pregnancy and sorry to say in my case it never went away. I did gain more than I was supposed to that time but in the beginning it was all water weight. Some people are just more prone to this. I am 23 weeks pregnant with my second and it did not happen this time. Just be careful beacsue if you do tend to hold water weight it could be a problem when you get further along. When I was about 5 months my hand and feet swelled horribly and my blood pressure rised really high. I ended up getting an emergency c-section at 37 weeks because of this. If you feel like something isn't normal or you just aren't sure, make sure you metion it to your doctor. If you wait until a prenatal appointment then write down all of your concerns ahead of time. Sometimes you can get excited about your appointments especially if you are having an ultrasound or looking forward to hearing your baby's heartbeat and you may forget to address your issues. Good luck.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I started bloating at 4 weeks. LOL.  I wasn't changing weight, but it seemed that my stomach and butt got bigger and my pants were snug.  <br>  At first I did the rubber band trick, put a band through the button hole and looped it over the button.<br>  <br>  But I went ahead and bought maternity clothes at about that time, you will need them anyway and they are more comfy.|`|5lmGvQzQaa	bloating is a sign of your baby receiving his/her proper intake of nutrition. if your like....not eating then the baby wont eat.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Your level of bloat can vary from day to day.

You're absolutely pregnant. The blood testing cannot be incorrect. Levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are produced only in pregnancy. These levels will also only rise with a continuing pregnancy. With a miscarriage, the numbers will stop and then decline.<br>  <br>  It is confusing because early on, often, the fetus cannot be detected by ultrasound. That is why specialists usually wait until later on to do this sort of test, because it is scary and upsetting with women who are actually pregnant.<br>  <br>  I went through this with my last pregnancy. The doctors couldn't find a fetus, told me I was no longer pregnant. My 'no longer pregnant' is upstairs in his high chair now blowing oatmeal raspberries at his father! There's more to my story, but please know that what you're going through means nothing more than that your early in pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Take it easy during these tender first few months because there are still risks, but this is the same for all pregnant women. Enjoy your pregnancy. Congrats sweetie!<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  When you go back, I'd suggest that you rely on the blood test results and an exterior ultrasound only. If I were you (I'm not, I know!), I would avoid any further trans-vaginal ultrasounds unless absolutely necessary; however, since you aren't experiencing pain, and if your hcg levels are increasing, it is unlikely that one will be necessary. Good luck hon!|`|gCBqdHf2aa	I just wanted to send my condolences.|`|BO28Mn8haa	I think it could be a chemical pregnancy. But I hope not! Good luck.<br>  <br>  Also, I had spotting for about 2 days and then some period like bleeding.. not as heavy as my normal period but along the lines of like the last or first day of a period. With the thick lining material of a period in some instances. Is that what you are getting? I was wondering what implantation bleeding may look like for a pregnant woman. (hoping you are, of course!)
qHa4w8eyaa	I had the same question, and am still not certain.  However, on fertilityfriend.com, the first day of spotting is not considered CD1.  Instead, they count the first day of bleeding as the start of your cycle. Of course, what one person considers spotting could be interpreted as light bleeding by another, so it's really up in the air.  I would wait until the end of your period and count backwards - If it typically lasts 5 days, count back from the last day of bleeding and consider that CD1.  Hope this helps. :)  Good luck!|`|OCk7I8JVaa	First, did you have an hcg blood test to rule out pregnancy?<br>  To be honest, it doesn't really matter which day you start. I would start on the first day of full blood flow, and if that ends up being cd 4, then it shouldn't make much difference if you ovulate a little later.
zdlLVB1Kaa	You could wait a few days and see if AF shows up and if not then test or you could test now and get an answer.  If it comes up negative then don't give up hope until AF shows.  You can always test again later.  A BFN right now doesn't necessarily mean you aren't pregnant.|`|ZckxI1M5aa	All of your symptons can be symptoms of AF coming.  They are all hormonal.  <br>  If AF does not arrive today, i'd take a test on Wednesday or Thursday just to be sure of accuracy.<br>  If its preganncy you want, i'm sending baby dust your way. But please don't stress yourself out.|`|0e16cb05bc41bf491dee9b4dcc4fd250aa	take a test tomorrow morning and get sure as that is the only way u can find out,so relax and just take a test with a positive thinking,good luck|`|3K7ffKn2aa	no one on here can say definitely pregnant or not. you have to test, and waiting to test won't change the answer.|`|eytlIKITaa	I'd wait another week, if AF still isn't here I'd take another test.|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	You could be pregnant, the systoms that you are having is the same ones that you have when you are pregnant. But you could also be having some problems with your period. The only thing that you could do is to take a pregnancy test and if it comes back that you are not pregnant is go to the doctor. And they could run test on you to see what is causing you to have pregnancy like systoms. But don't be scared to buy and take a pregnancy test. Cause you are going to have to find out what is wrong with you before it gets worse! Hope everything turns out alright.|`|hmOidFp3aa	Hey there! I am not quite sure what answers you are expecting but if you dont start your period tonight then there is a good chance! I would head out and buy a preggo test today anyway and take it with your FMU in the morning! Sore breasts are a GREAT indication that you are pregnant, and dont worry about the face, that is also a symptom. If you are pregnant that the increase and change in hormones can cause you to have mood swings, increased tenderness in your brest, slight crampings, frequent urination, a whole truckload of symptoms! And every girl is different when it comes to symptoms! But just coming from me, it sounds very promising! You could even just go buy a dollar tree test (they are accurate from 20 microliters on, which is good) if you get to ancy! I have before, i will take them a day or 2 before my period because I just want to know!! Plus if anything you just wasted a dollar! Good luck and tons of baby dust :)|`|JMj8HSaVaa	These are pregnancy signs,, i had most of them two weeks ago.. and i was concinced that i m pregnant... i wasnt..<br>  hopefully you are .. but i am really lost, and dont want to get attention to any pregnancy symptoms next two weeks .. <br>  that what happened to me..<br>  try not to think about it .. i will do the same.. Baby dust to you and me|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Hey i have the same thing,but my period is not due till march 1st,i have cramping since last week,my boobs hurt and im gassy as well,i got this pimple above my lip,i  am actually ttc my 2nd,im  sry i dont know the answer but i thought maybe u would want to know|`|NNwEuC8paa	It sounds like you are but don't get your hopes up! I would go buy a test and save it for a few days then test just to make sure you have waiting long enough. sore boobs,cramps and gas is a sign as well as the pimples. Just give it some more time! good luck!|`|28QPS6V9aa	The only thing you can do is test, we can't tell you if you're pregnant or not. We're not your doctor. Take a test in the morning and if it's positive congrats, if it's not then don't give up. It will happen eventually.|`|nULt2y9jaa	there is no concrete answer until you take a test!~!|`|WnlzScIyaa	Test in the morning! Try not to think about it!|`|qHa4w8eyaa	I'm sorry, but nobody can really give you a concrete answer at this point.  They say that the symptoms of pregnancy are similar to those of pms - so it's difficult to tell what's happening at this point.  It's also very early!  How about taking a home pregnancy test tomorrow morning?  Buy an extra and use it in a few days if AF still doesn't show up.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry or overthink too much.  I hope the results are what you wish them to be.|`|7kosr9mcaa	What kind of answer do you expect? None of us can tell you if you are pregnant or not. You could be. I'd wait a few more days and if you don't get your period then do a test. It is your own problem if you are scared, we can't help you with that.
7rCeCVl2aa	Not at all. I think it's a great idea and you will be so thankful after sleeping for an entire night. Good for you for asking for help! =)|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	no! everyone needs a break-we just dont all get one! ;0) if you do-thank goodness! and im sure i cried every night when my son wouldnt go back to sleep-im a girl who needs her rest to function at all|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Having a new baby is hard, harder than anyone can describe. Sleep when the baby sleeps, day and night. You might feel like you are sleeping 24hrs a day and that's ok, you have a newborn! Don't worry about housework or cooking, ask family to bring meals or stock up on microwave foods, cereal, and frozen pizza. Is dad around to give you a break? Let him take a feeding at night over the weekend if he works so you can sleep a bit more or let him take over in the evening so you can nap. Keep the baby close to your bed, don't turn on lights, and don't talk when he wakes up. All you want to do is check the diaper, feed, and put him back to sleep. The more awake he becomes such as crying while you run to another room to get him the harder it will be to get him back to sleep. <br>  <br>  Having the baby away for a while might sound like a good idea but I know personally I couldn't sleep with my son away, everyone is different though and it doesn't make you a bad mom for wanting some sleep. You might ask your mom if she would come stay the night with you instead. Get yourself some ear plugs and let your mom wake with the baby the first time so you get some solid sleep.<br>  <br>  I have plenty of friends that did have grandma take over a night early on and they are wonderful parents. As long as you know the baby is well cared for you are doing your job.|`|X6as2nOAaa	You are not a bad mom you are just tired my baby was 3 months old the first time she stayed at my moms.

No one can make you feel guilty, and no one can stop you from being guilty -guilt is based on your own personal moral code.<br>  <br>  There are lots of other ways to get more sleep.|`|qStmw7qgaa	NO!!!  You are a wonderful mom!  I had to do the same thing at that exact age.  And let me tell you, it is just as hard to drop your baby off at your mom's (my husband and I were only at the end of the drive way when I told him to turn around and go and get her back).  Trust me...this is a necessary thing!  Let your folks take her for a night...because that one night will help everything.<br>  <br>  P.S.  My husband didn't turn around.  We got a full nights sleep, we were both up at 7 the next morning, getting into the car to go and get our daughter.  But we slept.  It made things easier.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	The first few weeks after having a baby are a blur of happy tears, sad tears, frustration and sleep deprivation. You are not a bad mom! You could have a bit of post partum. Your hormone levels are way out of whack from birth, couple that with sleep deprivation and you have a recipe for disaster. What about your son's Dad, can he take over for a little bit? One night at your parents could be helpful. You could also go visit them and crash on the couch a few hours. Give yourself a break! And in a little while things will look up :)|`|3K7ffKn2aa	no its just hard having a newborn sometimes. Next time why not suggest your mom stay with you and the baby to help out when you need it. That way you can have your sleep and help, and not have the guilty feeling of having your new baby leave you. It'll be ok don't stress it. Congrats Mommy : )|`|TJ04fAgNaa	Goodness no, you're not a bad mom for asking for a break!  If anything, you're doing the best thing for him by getting help because if you aren't rested and are starting to get really frustrated, you can't be the best mom to him.  Good job asking for help!|`|OLTjkS4zaa	No your not a bad mom.  You just need a little help.  I hope you get the rest you need.  Also if you schedule permits try to take small naps during the day with your baby.  And know that it does get better.  I am so glad you did ask for help form your parents.|`|AA12314337	HECK NO!<br>  You need a break, and you shouldn't feel guilty about getting some time. It sounds like the daddy isn't available to give you some time to yourself, so you're doing the right thing by asking your mom. <br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|AA11765580	No, you are a normal mom.  Sleep deprivation can make you really irritable.  Let your parents have the baby for a night and get some sleep.  You'll feel better and so will the baby!|`|1e85af996a00b6352dde4d33312b5229aa	No way! You are a great mum! Having a newborn is exhausting! I have just had a boy. He is now 4 weeks old and my husband takes over for me once a week so I can get a good nights sleep and grandma had him one night in  the early weeks as I was close to Post natal depression. <br>  Before he came, I thought I would cope no problem, I mean, how hard can one baby be? All they do is eat sleep and poo! Easy right? Boy, did I get a shock!<br>  I have started to leave him to cry at night. As long as he has been fed, is dry, clean and has no wind, there should be no reason for him to not sleep. I now lay him down, he will cry for about 10 mins and then goes to sleep. A little crying does no harm. Of course, If he is crying hysterically, I won't leave him but you get to know when your baby has something wrong and when they are just fussing.<br>  Enjoy your night off! You will feel much better for it xxx|`|gfIWn6QDaa	Not at all sweetie. It is perfectly normal to get overwhelmed by your baby and the events going on in your life.<br>  <br>  You plan and make everything right and ready, but some how, when the baby is born, it gets all bumpy and tossed around.<br>  <br>  Be thankful your parents can take him for the evening. :) Good break for you and a chance for them to bond with their grandson.|`|OpVysSzQaa	gosh girl... its okay, and perfectly normal. there's alot of pressure on mothers these days, and I congratulate you for doing so well so far. go ahead and take your break and live it up! your baby loves you, everyone knows you love your baby, we just gotta make sure that life doesn't get in the way of the baby knowing that. :)|`|JFbWyKKDaa	No. You are being in control of the situation and it's better than Postpartum Depression and shaking your baby... not that you would ever on purpose, but it happens sometimes.  Parenting is a tough job... I think for me that the first six weeks were the toughest.  As he gets older you'll get used to the whole idea of being a parent as that takes time getting used to as well. Keep up the good work!|`|KUxEBQuYaa	no. my son spends one night on the weekend with one of his 3 sets of grandparents. (they all live kinda far so they don't get to see him very often except when they take him on the weekend.) its nice to have a break. every mom (and dad) needs one. take a break. enjoy a hot bubble bath, eat a good meal, read a good book, watch a re-run of your favorite show. enjoy your time for your sanity's sake.|`|YaC0mpXPaa	Not at all. I know a lot of mothers who have new born babies that have called me over to baby sit. Before you experience the exhaustion you think "id never leave my baby so young with anyone!"  Its not like that, especially if its your parents, someone you can TRUST!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	You are actually a BETTER mom for recognizing it is better for you and your son that you get a good night's sleep. You're no good to him as a walking zombie :)<br>  <br>  Take care and enjoy that night of sleep!|`|n6IBfiDPaa	NO! That does not make you a bad mom at all!<br>  You need a break! Its hard work! You deserve a little break, before you go crazy.<br>  Don't feel guilty about needing some you time. You need to take some time for you every now and then.|`|AHq8typuaa	no your not a bad mom its better for you and the baby as a matter of fact i use to send my babies to my parents house about every three weeks so i can have a clear mind and it helps with the grandparent bond|`|FQCLDT5faa	hell no you seem like a very good mommy!<br>  people stress out and need help its very good that you asked your parents for help one night away for you is good|`|eaO0MRaBaa	No. It is better that postnatal depression.|`|hY5mMi90aa	No u r not.  U r so lucky; you have a mom who is good and u can trust.  I had my mom come stay with me and it was great as I had a toddler.  She cooked and cleaned; so I just had to take care of baby and boy was I lucky.  You r tired from the delivery and changes in your body right now.  You r not use to getting up often to feed a baby.  When they r new we no longer feed them, go to sleep and here it is time for them to eat again.  So we also have other things to do such as house work and things.  One thing I did was keep my house so clean it was exhausting me.  They don't need it as clean as I did I mopped my floors every day. Ha Ha.  <br>  <br>  It is better just to keep the door to their world closed and be a stay at home mom for awhile lots of germs in the world today.  Wash your hands and wipes help to give to someone who may want to hold baby.  It is your baby just say what u need.  Crying is ok u r tired.  Your hormones r going back to prebirth.  It is alot different than being in your tummy.
4t5eGShiaa	Feed your baby "on demand". All children are different. They all eat different amounts at different times. So don't worry. Your baby can't over eat and she will let you know when she's full.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Feed your baby when he's hungry, and let him take what he wants/needs.   Every 2-3 hours is quite usual for a newborn, and he may have times of day when he wants to eat even more often. <br>  <br>  (If you were breastfeeding you wouldn't be measuring ounces, so don't measure ounces with a bottle either.  Let him eat until he's satisfied.)|`|nmu6coapaa	Switch him to a heavier feed|`|AA12314337	Feed him what he demands.

The numbers the doc's give you are just an average, every baby is different.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g..." rel="nofollow">http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g...</a><br>  For many babies the urge to suck is strong during these early months and your baby's need to suck may extend beyond his need for nourishment. For a bottle fed baby there is an increased risk of overfeeding if his sucking urge is misinterpreted as a sign of hunger<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g..." rel="nofollow">http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g...</a><br>  Overfeeding is a common problem for bottle fed babies because many young babies cannot control the flow of milk though an artificial nipple and/or cannot indicate when they have had enough. A baby's digestive system can become overloaded when it receives excessive amounts of milk from large volume feeds or frequent feeding patterns. The larger the volume of milk, the quicker it passes through the digestive tract. Large volumes of milk may pass through a baby's small intestine too quickly for all of the lactose to be digested.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ncane.com/vo5" rel="nofollow">http://ncane.com/vo5</a><br>  It is easy for a new parent to say that they won’t break these feeding rules; however, the reality is that the temptation to quickly quiet a crying baby in the middle of the night so that the parents can garner more sleep can overcome even the most diligent of parents. Even with the determination to never do it again, parents may turn to that late night bottle more and more simply because it works and allows the parent to go back to bed quicker. During the day when the parent may be too busy to take time out to calm the infant, the parent may give the infant a bottle, figuring that the child is hungry. To some, food is the quickest and easiest solution to quiet tears and screams.<br>  <br>  While the effects may not show right away, they can have an effect on the infant later on in life. Children who are overfed as infants have a greater chance of becoming obese as teenagers and adults. With the rising rate of obesity in children on the rise, it is best to try and curb this possibility when the child is very young. By prolonging the introduction of solids or any foods beyond formula until about six months, the parents have the best chance at keeping their child off the obese path at a young age. After the child is eating solids, it is best to keep away sugary foods. Young children do not need these empty calories as a part of their daily nutritional intake. Obesity, however, is the main concern for the future of the infant. Overfeeding can cause the infant to rely on food more constantly than the average child, thus increasing his or her food intake. If unnecessary, sugary foods are added to an infant’s diet, this too can add to the obesity factor.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,3764,0..." rel="nofollow">http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,3764,0...</a><br>  ANSWER<br>  August 3, 2001<br>  Dear Dad,<br>  Yes, it is possible to overfeed a four-week-old infant since it's easy to misinterpret a baby's hunger and satiety (fullness) signals. When full, babies will stop sucking, turn their heads or push the nipple out of their mouths as a signal. Babies who are overfed often are uncomfortable and irritable. More importantly, they sometimes loose the ability to recognize when they are hungry. Parents will want to start out from the beginning to allow their baby to signal hunger and have it responded to appropriately.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lpch.org/HealthLibrary/Parent..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lpch.org/HealthLibrary/Parent...</a><br>  # The maximal amount of formula recommended per day is 32 ounces (1 liter).<br>  # Overfeeding can cause vomiting, diarrhea or excessive weight gain.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  # The average amount of formula (in ounces) that babies take per feeding usually equals the baby's weight (in pounds) divided in half (or equal to the weight in kg).<br>  # The average ounces of formula the baby takes in 24 hours is the baby's weight in pounds multiplied by 2 (or kg multiplied by 4).<br>  # A baby's appetite varies throughout the day. If the infant stops feeding or loses interest, the feeding should be stopped.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/he..." rel="nofollow">http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/he...</a><br>  Both Drs. Rome and Rogers say nature and nurture are driving the childhood obesity epidemic. If parents are obese, the chances of their children becoming obese are about 90 percent, says Dr. Rogers. Not only is the genetic potential greater, children are more likely to be raised in an environment that contributes to obesity. For instance, overfeeding is a problem. The practice often begins in infancy when parents (and grandparents), out of love or ignorance, overfeed with formula, fruit juice and baby food.<br>  <br>  Dr. Rome believes that even if parents are obese, they can help prevent their kids from becoming similarly endowed if intervention begins early. For instance with newborns and babies, parents should learn through trial and error to discern between cries that signal hunger versus those that signal discomfort (e.g., from wet diapers).<br>  <br>  Parents should consult with a pediatrician to make sure infants receive proper portions of formula and at appropriate intervals, because unlike with breastfeeding, babies do not self regulate intake of formula. Once they are off breast milk or formula, children should drink whole milk until age 2; after that, they can switch to 2 percent milk. Fruit juice, which is notorious for high caloric counts, should be restricted to four ounces a day in a baby and less than 12 ounces from toddlerhood through age 5.|`|WGXdfh22aa	i would feed him as much as he wants. he could be going through a growth spurt. my son will be 3 weeks wed. and i just feed him whenever he is hungry. for his first week and a half he wanted to eat every 1-2 hours so i let him. now it is spacing out more|`|ELSKfMpxaa	He's growing.

You can develop scar tissue that can make it hard to carry a baby but the chances of that happening are also slim.

But i do think it is immature for women to think they don't want to breastfeed b/c its too sexual. But i guess it's just each persons opinion. What can you do?|`|AXEqOEloaa	If they weren't made to breastfeed they wouldn't lactate. Seeing them as sexual objects is fine but for the ones that do need to understand they are there to nourish our offspring.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I believe they are meant for both. My husband can watch me breastfeed and then later see them in a different way :) I on the other hand have had a hard time viewing them as sexual objects now that I BF.|`|kf1PWDb8aa	I think they are both. But they are seen as sexual objects because not everyone has them.
ArYvBhkpaa	Nope|`|uuHPneEcaa	i spotted one day. It was like 2 weeks before my period was about to start. Never had a period so I took a pregnancy test and it was positive.(5 days late) then I took another one when I was 7 days late and it was also positive. (went to a clinic with that one) they gave me my due date and everything. so u might be pregnant go ahead and take the test!!!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Sounds like implantation to me. I never had implantation bleeding but, a good few of my friends have. Call me freaking out "AAAHHHHH WHAT IS THIS?!" unless it gets heavier, or you get your period. Sounds like you're pregnant!|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	I have been pregnant 3 times and not once had implantation bleeding.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	no i didnt.. i dont konw anyone who did...<br>  <br>  but i would wait 2 more days and use your first pee.. i got my bfp on my 6th late day|`|OBn4a7rzaa	Heres my story in a nutshell, lol. My periods are irregular, and i hadnt started in 3 months, and i had never gone that long without a period, so i scheduled an appt with an obgyn. Also, i hadnt been using any form of protection, and hadnt gotten pregnant in over a year. So when i got to the appt the doctor prescribed me provera so i would start my period, and then once i started i was supposed to call him so we could schedule some kind of test to make sure everything was ok with me. So, I took the prescription and i never started and it had been 3 weeks, so i called back to let them know, and the nurse told me to take an hpt that night and then call her in the morning so they could figure out where to go from there. So right after the phone call, i went to pee, and when i wiped there was a little spot of tan discharge on the toilet paper, and i thought FINALLY! So then i didnt buy the test and later that night when i went to the bathroom there was still a little bit of LIGHT tan discharge when i wiped, but nothing on my panties, and it hadnt gotten any heavier in those 4 hours, and normally my period would have been in full force by now. So I went to go buy i test, (it was still that night) and the test was positive. It turns out that was my implantation bleeding. It was never pink or red, it always stayed that tan color, and then it went away about 10 hours after it started. Now im 21 weeks with a little baby girl!<br>  <br>  <br>  Once i had my u/s i found out that the bleeding had happened at 3 weeks 4 days pregnant.|`|Lpev0W5Taa	YES! I thought it was my period, but it never got heavier and it only lasted two days. I got the spotting about a week before my period was due.  I didn't a positive pregnancy test until I was 2 weeks late. Good luck!<br>  <br>  9 weeks with #1 :)|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Yep I did. I had my little girl 4 weeks ago:-) I wasn't regular nor really trying to get pregnant so I'm not sure how may days DPO I was when I happened I did get a early positive though at about 3 weeks pregnant.|`|kHmDUPsraa	No bleeding for me!
iZDsMCghaa	I believe this should depend if the kid has come to terms with the idea their parents have new partners and if they lie them. If they do, than yeah, why not but this day is for the kid and it should be comfortable for her and if she dosnt want the new partners there than they shouldnt go, period. Further more her parent should be cordial to each other at the least.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Is a quince some kind of event? At my wedding, my dad sat a separate table from my mother/stepfather.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	what?
SEzIkGNiaa	You should tell your mom. She will definately know what to do.  Your mother has been through it for years, and will understand how it is.<br>  <br>  Or, try doing your own laundry.  Sometimes they come out clean.  You might need to buy a stain remover spray if it doesnt come out all the way.|`|nKSmgjylaa	Heard of a washing machine? O.o <br>  LoL. It works for me, they're as good as new. (:|`|N24wkFROaa	What do you mean you can't tell your mum? You mean she doesn't know that you are on your periods?<br>  <br>  You need to tell her, she will understand.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the Pj's, you will have to hand wash them and the stains will come out (it's what my mum does with bloody knickers/trousers)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DWl8nfyWaa	I heard washing it in cold water helps get rid of the stain.  If your mom goes somewhere and leaves you alone, just throw it in the washing machine.  Good luck.|`|pJieNfzOaa	Seriously just put them in the wash, it happeneds all the time with me, the stain comes out and your mum won't think anything of it i promise.<br>  Good Luck. x|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	This will work:<br>  <br>  Cold water (NOT warm as it will "cook" the stain.  Soak the stain with cold water and rub hand soap on it.  Then rub the soapy fabric together, rinse with cold water and repeat.|`|M4xtPJ6eaa	Get them in the washing machine and wash them, the blood will come out. Best to deal with it sooner than later. You should also consider changing your sanitary product, it might not be enough for your flow.<br>  Wet wipes may have 'diluted' the stain. Use Vanish spray if you have it. Happens to everyone, don't worry about it.<br>  Don't try to do them in the bath- you need detergent, heat and lot of power, use the machine, easier and it's what your machine is for. the bath could leave permanent stain as it may 'fix' the blood.|`|Dx8eudXfaa	The best thing to do is to run cold water over them before the stain has set- i.e. right away. The rub the fabric together very briskly under the water. Once it's dried, it's almost impossible to get the blood stain out. Of course, you can try to scrub them, but it might not work. If they're white, you can bleach them. <br>  PS This happens to EVERY woman out there, usually many times over. The only way I found to prevent stains to pj's and sheets was to wear tampons to bed. Much easier.|`|iojRLiBGaa	You could try i guess.<br>  It might make the stain a little smaller, in which case tell your mum.<br>  Or put them in the wash while she isn't in or something.<br>  Or get some of the washing powder, put it in a sink of warm water and scrub the pants.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Why can't you tell your mom?<br>  <br>  Pour some peroxide on the stain. Let it sit for a little while. Then soak the pants in cold water. Next, rub the stain with a little laundry detergent. Wash it out with cold water. Let them soak again.<br>  <br>  They should be all good :)|`|MzCLomc0aa	Put them in the wash with something on top of where the stain is or if your mum has stain remover somewhere use that on the stain or use warm water and dab the stain don't rub it or it will make the stain bigger<br>  <br>  xx|`|hZcqEmbAaa	Fill the sink with hot water and put your pj's in and rub the material together this will take most of the stain away so when you mum washes them she wont even notice<br>  <br>  Just don't make it too hot or you will burn your hand!!
KDb96QS7aa	OMG! I have been there - my kid was super colicy (only slept like 5 hrs a day at first) and my husband also unable to help and my family and friends halfway across the country. I know how much it sucks and how desperate you are ...IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.  I would not wish colic on my worst enemy.  Now that that is said, try these:<br>  <br>  1. Check your diet - is it associated with dairy (most common cause of diet-related colic)? Eliminate high protein dairy products.<br>  2. Swaddle tight <br>  3. Try some acidophilus powder (crush a tablet and rub a little on your nipple once a day before bf-ing) ...and of course double check with ped it's okay this is the reference that it is safe: journal of pediatrics jan 07 <br>  4. Wear a sling. I liked the infantino one. Got bad reviews at BRU, but was a lifesaver for me. <br>  5. Is it possible you have an overactive let-down or oversupply? This can cause a different kind of lactose intolerance from a foremilk/hindmilk imbalance.<br>  6. Some people say different holds (like laying baby tummy down across your forearm) and massages help though they didn't for me.<br>  7. Try letting her sleep just a little while on her tummy while you're right there watching - the pressure can work some of the gas out and when you leave you can flip her to her back.<br>  8. Some consider it risky, but I also found a sleep positioner was very helpful to place him on his side.<br>  9. White noise/vacuum around her in the carseat/put her in the carseat on top of the washer or dryer (stay there to make sure it doesn't fall)<br>  That's all I got - other than encouragement that it really DOES get better and to keep breastfeeding/pumping so you don't lose your supply, it will get better and you'll be glad you're still breastfeeding. You can do it! Good luck!|`|wURg3jBcaa	The 5 S's - Swaddling, Shushing, Sucking, Side, Swinging.<br>  <br>  You definitely need to check out the Happiest Baby on the Block- it goes through how to do the 5 S's so you have a calm baby.  There is a book and DVD.  Check out the preview in the link below.  I know you didn't ask for any bullsh*t websites, but I believe this is the answer to your problems.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thehappiestbaby.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehappiestbaby.com/</a>|`|qStmw7qgaa	You are so not a horrid mother.  You are a freakin' super mom with all that you are doing.  Good heavens.  And your poor baby!  That is a lot of air in that little tummy.  Have you tried gripe water yet?  That is supposed to help pass the air.  I was a super colicky baby and what my mom did was mix a little rice cereal in with her breast milk and fed it to me through a feeder (that is what they were called back then (I'm 25...) but I think you can just use a bottle and a fast flow nipple.  I would suggest a teaspoon per ounce or per 2 ounces.  But if that is crazy to you, then don't do it.  It helped me when I was a baby.  I know that that isn't the way things are done now...so do what is right for you on that one.  Have you tried happi tummi???  It is an herbal waist band that you put around your babies tummy.  I used that w/ my daughter....it worked really well.  Here is the web site to check out.  It really did a great job for my daughter.  Good luck.  I really hope that this gets better for you.|`|0DUzshQUaa	Try giving her gas drops, you can get the walmart brand and give them every 2 hours. Also you can try getting some gripe water, you cant give that as often, so I would try the gas drops first. They worked wonders for my son who was colicy. I still actually give them to him and he is 8 1/2 months old.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	im so sorry. my sister went thru the same thing. she used to do these exercises with her baby where she would lay him down and like roll his body, buy putting his knees to his chest and rolling down to like straight leg position. to like try to push some of the air out. she would also run water to sooth the crying or a vacuum.<br>  other then that she would just bounce him all day and walk the halls with him.. it was a long grooling process and right about 4 months he just stoped crying and the gas went away..<br>  she also used those drops... <br>  <br>  good luck|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	First, take a deep breath and as hard as it is, try to relax.  My daughter was very colicky for about 2 months, so I know what you are going through.  You really need to buy the book "The happiest baby on the block" by Dr. Karp.  It teaches you all about colic, the reasons for it and ways to help calm your baby, and it really works.  As soon as I got down the techniques he teaches, my baby was calm again.<br>  <br>  The main things you need to do is swaddle your baby very tightly, give him/her a pacifier, rock her and use some white noise to calm her, such as a hair dryer.  If you do all these things together, your baby should stop crying within a minute or two.  It really works!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hVVALFAPaa	First, CALM down! She can sense your stress and that will set her off more. I know you are under a terrible amount of stress now but it isn't helping either one of you.<br>  <br>  What helped me and my collicky son:<br>  <br>  --Keeping the house quiet and darker all day.<br>  -putting her in her car seat and putting it on the washing machine, dryer or dishwasher ( the vibration and jiggling seemed to help)<br>  --music with a definite beat and rhythm - theme from Young and Restless, also called Nadia' Theme was the best. Played it for hours on end.)<br>  --baby swing<br>  --a couple of teaspoons of warm water right before the crying started<br>  --holding her football style (face down, along your forearm, with her legs straddling your elbow and your hand supporting her neck/head/face)<br>  --mylecon drops (may be called symethicone or something like that-- available in any pharmacy or drugstore-- to help decrease the gas.)<br>  --taking a break! Get your mom or neighbor or someone to take over sometimes -- for a day or take turns dealing with the screaming.<br>  <br>  Remember, she does not know what she wants either! Keep trying all sorts of different things!|`|qFmOuXMXaa	: held her and walked and  rocked and bounced her every night for about 5 hours. And the sometimes it was All day long.<br>    Good luck

SsCMH480aa	well when u see a little head poking out of ur va-jay-jay and you screaming in pain, you can be sure ur having a baby|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	It's head would be coming out of your hoo hoo.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Well, you'll eventually see a head coming out of your vagina. At that point you can be pretty sure your having a baby.
vcRm8ps8aa	look, enough of these pregnancy questions. Youve been asking loads. Why is your name allen? Isnt that a boy's name? Just go and ask your girlfriend to take a pregnancy test, that is the only way you will know for sure. People on here can just give you thier opinions and advice, they cannot say wether you are pregnant or not|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I don't think that's a symptom.  You can experience irregular heart beats because of the extra blood flow but not pain.  I had pain but I have a heart murmur...didn't have to do with baby.  If you go to an OBGYN for chest pains during pregnancy (like I did) I guarantee you'll be referred to a cardiologist.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Never heard of it. I mean it's a pregnancy symptom later on in your pregnancy. When they baby is so big and puts pressure on your ribs, that's about it. First symptom of pregnancy is usually a missed period. Then morning sickness. It's different for every woman though.|`|AA12062311	Chest pains would not be one of the first signs of pregnancy. You might experience some in later stages as the baby starts to take up more room and starts kicking at your ribs. I would see a doctor, especially if the chest pains are new and on going. This could be a sign of a serious medical condition.|`|a8ws0XVtaa	I have no idea if this is a pregnancy symptom, but I had horrible chest pain and couldn't figure out why and later I realized I was pregnant.  I'm not sure if they were related but I definitely had chest pains early on in pregnancy.|`|bo4MguzVaa	chest pains is not a pregnancy symptom that I ever heard of.<br>  <br>  When I got pregnant my first few signs were extreme tiredness, mega moodiness, bloating, and then a missed period.|`|NLwwRtwwaa	Chest pains are not a sign of pregnancy. I been through 2 pregnancy and never experience this problem. The first common signs are missed period, vomiting, frequent urination and spotting. You should check with your doctor if the pain is consistent.

e2ftmxWjaa	With my second pregnancy, i had 2 periods in the first 2 months - thought i'd lost the baby at first - but fortunately, she's still here!|`|bo4MguzVaa	Take a test, it's possible, and if you are pregnant you will want to watch any spotting or bleeding b/c it could be dangerous to a pregnancy.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	Yes.  Take a HPT to be sure.|`|j49IqTdiaa	yes it is.... why?
hmOidFp3aa	They should take precautions! If not tell them! They should ask before they take any xrays if there is any chance that you are pregnant and give you one of those apron shields :)<br>  But if you want to know for sure wait and ask them if you can wait another week to take out your wisdom teeth until you get a yes or no on your HPT! Good luck and TONS of baby dust!~|`|wiAVa1H5aa	The x-rays aren't good for embryos, but it's of your face not your uterus - and if the doctor has the low dose xray machines (digital) you won't need to worry about dosage.  But yes, most doctors want to wait until you are in the 2nd trimester to do procedures just in case, but if you're not pregnant yet you're not pregnant - and usually wisdom teeth extraction isn't scheduled rapidly, you may need to wait a month.|`|8RfmosODaa	How far along do you think you are? If I were you I would wait til your period is due then test to see. If it makes you feel more comfortable then wait a week after that just to be sure (in case the hcg in your system are low) and if it is negative then have your teeth removed before your next period. Also I would suggest using protecting just in case so you can get your teeth taken care of. I know how you feel, mine are justin starting to come in also and I just m/c 6 weeks ago and i need to get mine done. This way they wont bother you when you do get pregnant. Baby Dust to you!!
WPI0Z47saa	A polyp and a baby do not look anything alike and a doctor would know this immediately. You also wouldn't get pregnancy symptoms like you were describing that early. Many women do not even know that they are pregnant until they are 4-6 weeks pregnant. It takes up to 2 weeks after sex for implantation to even occur and the start of your baby. This really sounds totally unrelated to pregnancy and you should let your dr know. Good luck.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	No.  A polyp and a baby are two entirely different things and I highly doubt a Dr. would get that wrong.<br>  As for your symptoms, you don't mention when your last period was, so it's hard to say if it's even too early for symptoms.  (It usually is too early if you haven't missed a period yet if your cycle is pretty regular)
SsCMH480aa	I actually learned about this in psycology class. Its called the Electra complex. This is where girls get to a stage where they start to have sexual feelings for their fathers and in turn jealous their mothers or the lady in their dad's life. But this usually happens around age 5 so i dun kno if this is a late onset for ur step daughter or if she has issues...i would get that checked out though....that can't be normal|`|bMyq2nOTaa	If this is even a real question (which I doubt), it seems she's jealous, but not in a pervy way... She's watching to see how far you two are taking it... She obviously knows that if her dad is attracted to you *in that way*, she may just see a bulge. (Hey, you asked!)|`|VqN3xV1uaa	Yes, you should talk to the boyfriend. It is probably nothing. If you think she is really attracted to him that way, encourage your son to have sex with her to get her mind off of her dad.|`|eV6MHADQaa	If her dad is still in her life he's a hero to her  and every princess want's to be with her hero. but if she turns 13 and still feels that way worry|`|H0e0YAZ5aa	Well of course dear, if it has to do with his daughter, he should be aware of everything, and if you are living together you should be able to talk about your children|`|F6lZHRkVaa	You should tell your boyfriend, but also remember that kids learn this behavior from somewhere else. There's a chance this little girl has been molested at some point, so when you talk to your boyfriend be empathetic and kind. Don't be 'grossed out'. This little girl has very likely had some disturbing things done to her.|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	Think about it. Your not her mother so she feels you are both in competition for his attention.

bBWHrEciaa	I agree on the "relax" comments. Try to not think about it constantly. Try having sex every other day and that pretty much covers all your bases! If you have it every day, sperm count can diminish. My plan this time around is every other day the ENTIRE month. My girlfriend was fighting with her hubby and decided not to try on their 15 month of no success. They got in a huge fight a week after she ovulated and had sex (which is outside of the pregnancy window) and somehow got pregnant. She knows she got pregnant then since it's the only time they had sex. Moral of the story is...don't limit it, do it for more days than you think!|`|LCryvb7qaa	Relax. As simple as it is it's some of the best advice you can get when TTC. Don't work yourself up or overwhelm your mind with the thought of not conceiving. Keep trying and just enjoy the whole experience!|`|hmOidFp3aa	I will agree with the last answer! Relax, if you stress to much about TTC then it can actually hinder it!<br>  second, having sex every day is a good way to keep you NOT pregnant! That doesnt give the males body enough time to regenerate enough sperm! It is reccomended to have sex every other day through your fertile window! Sperm is good for 3 days so if you have sex every other then it is bound to happen at one point or another! Dont forget to make the baby making process fun! Good Luck and TONS of baby dust :)
8RfmosODaa	I would think your positives are from the previous babies.It can stay positive for sere val weeks after a miscarriage.  (Sorry for your lost!!) It is common to bleed and cramp after a miscarriage. I didn't have a d&c but i bled for about a week. Then 25 days later i had a period which was pretty heavy and i was really crampy. I would wait to try again after you have at least one full period that way everything has been able to heal.
flWS1h7vaa	my fav.out of those is Aliyah that is a beautiful name|`|u7o75zipaa	I'm not that fond on any to be honest.<br>  <br>  Aliyah is .. okay. I don't hate it, but I don't rate it.<br>  Jolene is the best. I wouldn't use it personally, but it does have a nice sound to it.<br>  Jazalynn looks and sounds brash. Really don't like it sorry.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Alia I like<br>  Out of your choice, Jolene|`|b39b7f47f5fedb8389798c15fe4a967daa	Aliyah- overdone and people will think you named it after the singer<br>  <br>  Jolene- pronounced "jo-leen?" why?!?!<br>  <br>  Jazalynn- u deff made it up|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	Jolene|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Aliyah|`|AA10458195	Aliyah. It is pretty and comes off the tongue so smoothly.|`|guVczXfUaa	Ew, I hate Jazalynn.  It sounds like a 12 year old popstar, bleah.  I like Aliyah, but it depends on how you pronounce it.  I think AH-li-a sounds better than a-LEE-a (if that makes sense).  Jolene's okay, but just a bit bland.|`|DdsGth25aa	Aliyah is to common, Jazalynn and Jolene I don't like.  Aniah is pretty. or Makenzie.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I don't like any of those, sorry.  <br>  <br>  I think these are better and they are similar to the ones you listed:<br>  <br>  Joelle<br>  Jovi<br>  Leah|`|3S2gw8D1aa	My favorite is Aliyah, it has a very pretty sound and I like that it's unique.|`|VTkRjExmaa	i like Jozalyn...<br>  <br>  but i still prefer the spelling Diosa --it means Goddess..|`|D0y3MwDcaa	I LOVE Jazalyn Aliyah!  that is a really cute first name and middle name together!|`|bcb975a6a5422a999658b591957e3b9faa	Aliyah is cute|`|xGJhBCk5aa	Personally, not a fan of any of them but Jolene and Aliyah are definitely better than Jazalynn, which I think sounds like you're trying to put too many names together...<br>  <br>  But good luck and I hope you find the right name!|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I love Aliyah.
D0y3MwDcaa	Jazalynn Kay Louise Collins(:|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Jazalynn kay louise collins|`|6Swq0iEPaa	Out of all of them, I like Jolene Louise Kay Collins. Good luck!|`|yv94euDBaa	Jolene Kay Louise Collins or Aaliyah Kay Louise Collins|`|iPje1iyGaa	I like Aaliyah kay louise or Jolene kay louise<br>  <br>  They flow the best and don't sound like a mouthful.|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Aaliyah kay louise collins|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I love Jolene kay louise collins. It's beautiful.|`|xPHwKen3aa	Jessalyn kay louise collins <br>   i like that name (:<br>  my middle name is kay too<br>  good luck|`|yrkMVrbtaa	how about none of them they all wreak of distaste.
vjoyv5J6aa	I use BioFreeze! It saved my life. I'm 33 weeks now and its tolerable. I thinks its impossible to sleep RIGHT when you're pregnant. I always hurt and I have 3 herniated disc in my lower back, but bio freeze is amazing and the Dr. said I can use it. Extra Strength Tylenol is ok too. Just relax if you can lay down asap and a warm shower always helps.|`|AFhj4BdBaa	Contractions.|`|99aec736873337f005579944c4876997aa	get a doughnut.|`|AA10478146	Take some Tylenol.
nzY94B7waa	I showed way sooner with my 2nd and 3rd then I did with my first.  I think people started to notice I was pregnant with my first around 5-6 months.  With the 2nd and the 3rd it was more like 3-4 months.  You are not fat, it's completely normal.|`|gCBqdHf2aa	That is what I've read online and in my book "what to expect when expecting" thats mean of your husband|`|DutTBV3caa	one, youre definately not fat so tell your husband to shut up! lol<br>  i wish i was your size lol. i'm 10weeks tomorrow, 5"7 and just hit 145lbs. lol i alrmost cried. <br>  anyways, i've heard that with the second pregnancy you do show sooner. i've also heard that giving birth goes a lot smoother so hopefully thats right!<br>  congrats on your baby :)|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	I don't think that you sound fat at all. I wished that I weighted that much now! Tell him that you are pregnant and that you are going to get big because there is a baby in there that is growing everyday and month to month. But I did show sooner with my second child. I also felt pregnant sooner with my second. I had the pregnancy systoms faster and could tell that I was pregnant and knew what was going to happen from month to month. But anywho hope that this helps. And good luck and congrats on the upcoming baby!|`|hGNvbC6oaa	Wow, your husband is a shallow ***!  How rude to say to a pregnant mother of HIS child.<br>  I'm pregnant with #2 and yes, my pants started getting tighter around 7 weeks and I'm now a little over 12 weeks and I'm completely not fitting into them.  Actually, I wear some maternity pants now also.  <br>  So, yes, it's completely normal with child #2.|`|LeY6hx4Laa	yep im 8 weeks now with my second and my jeans are getting tight already, so im looking for a belly belt!!|`|CpiLHcTlaa	Some women do some women don't. most i know did. my mom didn;t with my brother she was big and with me no one knew she was pregnant until she was 7 months! how ever your husband should shut up! thats so mean! though i suppose you could chalk it up to a case of foot in mouth<br>  <br>   i remember i asked my bf if it looked like i'd gained any weight so far and he said 'yeah you look like you've gain like 50 pounds!" he got the cold shoulder for the rest the day. (he didn't mean it just a foot in mouth moment XD)|`|f0dnVAW7aa	Oh Goodness - sweetheart.. you are SO not fat!! Men are just insensitive at times. <br>  <br>  But yes, it is completely possible (and very likely) that you are beginning to show. I just had my second child three weeks ago this coming Wednesday and I remember with her I was showing what seemed to be from the start.. around 6 weeks. <br>  <br>  It is normal to show earlier with your second pregnancy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!|`|vjoyv5J6aa	Yes totally. You have layers of muscles around your stomach, they try really hard the first time to stay tight and support and at the very end they finally let go. Well.... they don't exactly go back all the way. I was 8 weeks and I had a hard time wearing my clothes, I think my body was just bloated and it was very uncomfortable, but compared to my sister-in-law on number two. I was much smaller. They measure your uterus and it should correlate to weeks... 18 weeks 18 inches. If that's normal you're normal, but when it sits in your body may be anywhere.|`|WGXdfh22aa	yes. i definitely was showing alot sooner with my second.|`|SxHvknWMaa	It's true. And you are not fat.
ZbnxGIsnaa	What are signs of ovulation?<br>  <br>  The signs of ovulation can be any of the following, although many women may only notice one or two of these:<br>  ? Change in cervical fluid<br>  ? Change in cervical position and cervical firmness<br>  ? Brief twinge of pain or dull ache that is felt on one side of the abdomen<br>  ? Light spotting<br>  ? Increase in sex drive<br>  ? Elevated level of the luteinizing hormone which can be detected on a test<br>  ? Body temperature chart that shows a consistent change<br>  ? Breast tenderness<br>  ? Abdominal bloating<br>  ? Heightened sense of vision, smell or taste<br>  <br>  Well, I will use my Mother as an example regarding feeling sick.  She told me just recently when she ovulates she actually fills sick.  So, it's probably just down to ovulation getting ready to take affect.  =)|`|HSUfe3m7aa	The hormone flood that brings on ovulation can also cause nauseousness for some, as well as ovulating itself.|`|bBWHrEciaa	I would say that it's not likely that you can be this early. I was extremely ill with my last pregnancy (especially since it was twins) but morning sickness didn't kick in until about the 6th week or so. Sometimes your mind can play tricks on you when you want to be pregnant so badly. Try not to think about it so much...chalk up everything to a flu bug or something to help ease your stress. It helps to relax you more than over-analyzing your body. I'm at fault for this constantly....especially when you want nothing more than to be pregnant. Good luck!|`|kuIVIy57aa	Your nerves could be the reason your so nauseous. Believe me, there are many more symptoms to being pregnant then just nausea. That usually is not he first thing to start anyway. Calm down. If your period does not start when it should, take a home pregnancy test. Until then, don't borrow trouble!!|`|NNwEuC8paa	First off. Ovulation can happen at ANY time. You can get pregnant, RIGHT before, ON, and RIGHT after your period so don't listen to people who tell you otherwise, Wait a few days a test first thing in the morning! Good luck!
AA12314337	If you aren't due until the 28th, your test on the 20th was WAY too early. Even the "early" tests can only be used 5 days sooner.<br>  <br>  BUT, even if you are pregnant, it's also too early for any symptoms to show up (especially the weight gain). <br>  <br>  Good luck with your efforts!|`|mTl9l3aMaa	If you don't have your period when you're supposed to, then take a preggo test. Don't take it prematurely though.|`|fLRvw9Zsaa	take the test after 5 days of actual date check so some case it show result but sometime its is not possible , so u need to take test after week again or u consult doctor they will do blood work u can  know the result
0SIhrYCbaa	You lied about being pregnant and he actually had unprotected sex with you afterward? He shouldn't be surprised at all. In fact he should expect it as you obviously planned to get pregnant.<br>  He really doesn't learn from his mistakes does he?<br>  If you tell him now he won't believe you or he'll think its another bad joke.|`|uuHPneEcaa	1st of all never lie about being pregnant. okay.. 2nd u should just wait until u have a missed period then take a pregnancy test and if it comes out positive tell him.. He may not even beleive u because u lied the last time.but if u have to keep the test so u can prove it to him that ur pregnant and its his.  If u aren't pregnant get on birthcontrol and always make sure he straps up before u too have sex.<br>  <br>  (i didn't tell anyone i was pregnant until i knew for sure that I was and that was after the second pregnancy test and when they gave me a due date)|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	That was pretty dirty to lie in the first place. But I'd definately let him know..its his child and his right. If you think he wont believe you, then just show him the positive test. You cant argue with that..<br>  <br>  You both need to get this all straightened out and you BOTH need to have a talk with your parents. It would be highly dangerous to hide something like this when you're so young.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	You need to find out if you are first. A lot of things could be causing pregnancy like symptoms (hunger, fatigue, missed period), but not actually be pregnancy. I would just try and find out for myself before i said anything to him. If your not please be more careful with sex.|`|qayCggxMaa	Find out for sure first.  Then, either have a home pregnancy test in hand and take it in front of him to prove it or take him to the doctor with you for confirmation.  After you lied about it once, he has a right to be skeptical now.|`|OU9xnW86aa	You need to find out if you really are pregnancy before you start telling people that you are.|`|vjoyv5J6aa	Take a test and show him the test. After one scare you should have been more careful. I'm scared of all the responsibility and I'm 27. Take a test and show him the actual test. If it says you are than it the test proving it not just your word. Talk to him and tell him you are sorry about before and you are sorry to loose his trust, but you love him and you are scared. He may not react the way you want right away, so give him time. Men have weird ways to react to such news.|`|mTl9l3aMaa	Well, you're pro'lly in the 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf' situation, but of course, if you are preggo, someone will know for sure eventually. Take a preggo test. I know that being preggo that age is tough, but if you really can't take care of the child, choose the loving option, which is adoption.<br>  <br>  So many teens screwing around these days...|`|6zPCQ7rPaa	well you have to admit you did it to yourself can you blame him?get a test and take it with him right there with you.so that way he has to believe you.|`|mbP4pEJqaa	Yes you need to if you want your relationship to continue, you must tell the truth, cuz lies always mess up! Maybe talk too someone else first and don't leave it too late!|`|NHjFaeTLaa	Wait tell you super sure your pregnant and if you are tell him. If he doesn't  <br>  believe you he will have to when you start to get a bump!|`|c0plf0VLaa	You should probably make sure you're positive you're pregnant before you go around telling people about it again.. Take an at home test if you're more than a week late or go to the dr's.|`|WnlzScIyaa	Don't tell him untill you know for sure. And take a test, they are a dollar at the dollar store.|`|FpwRrOwxaa	You've got to tell him if it's his child. Sorry.
cTsb7vFjaa	Depends if the baby cooperates.  I got an amazing shot, and when she was born, you could clearly see the resemblance from the ultrasound.  Even before she was born, we could see that she looked exactly like her daddy.  It is such a great experience.  Hope that her eyes are open when you get the exam....it is so neat.<br>  <br>  Also, if she's not in a good position, walk around for a bit, and she may move around.  They had me do this and it worked.|`|CJqK40uFaa	i got mine on valentine's day and i was 29 weeks pregnant. at first my baby was facing my back and it took us about 20 minutes to get him to turn to the side so we could see his face, but once he turned he was facing out for about 10-15 minutes. enough to get like 5 good pics of his face. i also got a dvd of the session too. it was well worth it! hopefully this link works so u can see how they turned out..its only 3 of them but i actually got 8 pics in all...good luck! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.parentsconnect.com/connect/boards/birth_circles/2009/april/chat_it_up_thread.jhtml?tID=49574" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentsconnect.com/connect/bo...</a>|`|G6eBvDz8aa	Well. Ours turned out AMAZING.. after we went back the third time.. both the first and second times, she kept putting her hands and FEET in front of her face.. we didn't get anyyyy good shots but the last one we got oh gosh you can tell how much it looks like from the ultraosund to birth.. pretty crazy! :P|`|Hv7Z8U3vaa	The face is usually the easy part assuming baby's not hiding. Even so, I think it's worth the little extra to get a glimpse. It helps bonding start that much sooner. Enjoy!
GE9dgLXKaa	Honey I feel your pain.  I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks on December 27th and I fell pregnant again 2 weeks after the miscarriage and just had another one yesterday at 8 weeks.  I feel like the world is crashing down on me.  I am trying to be strong but it's hard to.  I cry when I am alone sometimes too.  I often ask Why me?  I have lost 2 angel babies.  I never thought I would have to go thru this but the one thing that keeps me going is thinking there is a reason for it.  You might not see it now but someday you will.  I know in time that I will be blessed with a baby and it will be even more special to me when I finally get it.  Hang in there and try again in a couple of weeks.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	allow yourself to cry noone expects you to be strong it was your baby <br>  take each day as it come but DO NOT keep it all in or u will crack when u least expect it <br>  x x x x|`|mTl9l3aMaa	I'm not a woman, so I'll never personally have a miscarriage. But I'm sure it is very painful for a woman to lose her precious child. Even though I'm male, I have feelings too! If my wife had a miscarriage, I'd just be....just be....|`|6PR8Cj2raa	I recently had a miscarriage back in Nov. It was very hard for me, me and my husband have been trying for yrs to have a baby. I was really sad for awhile. But I do know that things happen for a reason. And even though you dont think so now it will eventually get better.  My husband really helped me through it, without him i think i would of been way worse then i was. Everyone deals with things differently!! Good luck, and even though i know you dont want to hear it. it does eventually get better!!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	you have to carry on... even if its hard now, tomorrow will be better.<br>  you have to tell yourself that everything happens for a reason. This is not the end of the world for you, and depression will not help you at all..<br>  Stay stong, and try again when you are ready
UMouJTJeaa	Yeah its really pretty :)|`|6VR19YQWaa	Lauren is always a pretty name.....it's classic, but pretty all around. <br>  However..Louise....I don't know if i'd want that as MY name. It just rings old to me.|`|DgMFQRuHaa	cute.|`|yv94euDBaa	Lauren (Lar-En) is a little to common for my taste.<br>  <br>  What about:<br>  <br>  Loren (Lor-En)<br>  Lorne (Lorn)<br>  Lorna<br>  Luna<br>  Laurel<br>  Laurie|`|And9dyrwaa	yeah nice name.l like it|`|6Nuaqihpaa	Lauren is my big sister's name. :) Her middle name is Ray.<br>  And my roommate's name is Natalie Louise. Lol.<br>  <br>  I like those names, but I don't like them together. Sometimes I think names with double-letter sounds are kind of cartoonish. It just sounds like naming someone Allie Anne.|`|D0oqTblpaa	While it sounds really pretty to say aloud you are inviting trouble with the name Lauren.  My sister's name is Lauren and I know a bunch of others and they never seem to come to any good.  I don't think it's the name but knock on wood before you name a daughter Lauren.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	Lauren is cute! Louise is too old fashioned!|`|61NKzPzMaa	I like Lauren and Louise but not together.<br>  <br>  And it's pregnant not prgnant and you not u.
NNwEuC8paa	Hmm you are in the wrong section. This is for girls trying to get pregnant.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	You might want to try reposting this under education instead of pregnancy.  You will get better answers there.|`|SY80570Laa	u asking tis hear means ,,,, u r asking how many times u can **** anna university to make it pregnant, in hand u have one chance is in it??|`|C8pXKpwyaa	Lol are you the worlds second man to get pregnant!!? Hehe soory try a different area - such as education and reference :D good luck though x.|`|hmOidFp3aa	Unless your trying to get pregnant, I cant help :)
PFJ7ZbVZaa	Sounds like Braxton-Hicks contractions, but I would most definitely go get checked out ASAP at your doctor's office!  It's better to be safe than sorry!  And anytime anything doesn't feel right, it's best to get checked out!  I had started getting BH contractions around the same time as you, and I went to my OB to make sure it wasn't anything serious.  Good luck!|`|MtC3CWZraa	Google "braxton hicks" and I can pretty much guarantee that the description you'll read is what you experienced last night. <br>  <br>  That said, any time something concerns you, call your doctor. Answering your questions between visits is part of their job.|`|v3LnJycKaa	i have been having them too (23weeks) they are braxton hicks which are much mroe pronounced in subsequent pregnancies, mention it to your dr at the next app and ask him to check you just to be safe..|`|LCryvb7qaa	Yes! They may just be braxton hicks but don't take any chances. If you really feel like somethings just not right you shouldn't hesitate to call. When I was 26 weeks pregnant with my son I was having cramping, contractions that were very irregular, and a heaviness on my pelvic floor. I felt really silly but I called my doctor and they had me go to the hospital right away. I was one centimeter dilated when I got there. I was put on bed rest for the rest of my pregnancy and in and out of the hospital for preterm labor, steroid shots in case he was born early, you name it. With lots of prayers he ended up being three days past due date and perfectly healthy! But never take the chance, call!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	They aren't real contractions unless they are like clockwork and you can continually time the exact time when the next one is coming on. <br>  <br>  Also if the pain is lasting over an hour each time, talk to your Dr about it.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	i would just to be on the safe side. but as long as they stopped i think your ok...<br>  <br>  just go double check.|`|OU9xnW86aa	Are you sure they weren't Braxton Hicks??
6VZGYCZcaa	I wouldn't really worry right now. 8 days is really too soon to test. To get a more accurate result I would test in about 12 days. I took a pregnancy test on the day I was supposed to start my period and it was negative, then went back 2 days after that and it was very clear +. Good luck!|`|uuHPneEcaa	No u have nothing to worry about. just go to ur doctor I am sure everything is fine. U are pregnant congrats.. its very rare that u will get a false positive. u have nothing to worry about I am sure of that. no matter if that line wasn't that clear and u saw it ur pregnant. mine wasn't that clear either and I was very much pregnant with my 1st child (i was only 5 days late when i took my test)|`|Z1FdawAOaa	don't worry about the faint line. it just means your hormone level isn't very high. as for your pregnancy try taking some vitamins to help you and your baby grow.<br>  <br>  good luck and congratulations!|`|mTyu7CKoaa	no the color of the line doesnt matter, as long as its positive... and brown blood is on, it means  its old blood, its when it turns pink then red u have to worry.... Good Luck!!!|`|OU9xnW86aa	It's still too early for a HPT to show up positive. Relax, don't do anything strenuous, and try to make this one stick! GOOD LUCK!!! :)|`|ea6e861f02efbe475e33340ca6a879c3aa	I also had the faint positive tests until I was almost 4 months, but the doctor said it could have been bad tests, too diluted urine, or my levels just weren't up high enough.  Even my blood levels test lower than how far along I am.  And about the spotting and the past miscarriages, which I am sorry to hear happened.  Some women do spot during pregnancies and everything is ok.  But are you by any chance Rh (-)? According to the doctor I saw, you can have a miscarriage if you don't get the shots for it. I started spotting like you at about 11 weeks and it progressed to actual bleeding and apparently, it was because I am Rh- and the baby's blood came into contact with mine and my body was trying to fight the pregnancy off, but I got the shot and everything has been ok since.  Good luck to you, I hope everything works out.|`|AA10262621	Just watch and if it turns bright red or is heavy go to ER or call your doc. I had the same thing around 9 weeks in my last pregnancy. Some woman have periods thier whole pregnancy so everyone is different. Good luck.|`|dmB2QwANaa	well i know how you can be worried about tis bt theres nothing to worry about. my sisters did the same bt no matter how light or dark it is its still pssitiv and trust me its not going to go back negative. so dnt worry
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I have a daughter that just turned 11 last month.  She has wanted to stay home alone and/or babysit for quite some time before that.<br>  <br>  In our state, there are no laws regarding the age a child can stay home alone or babysit.  However, the local hospital and the Red Cross offer babysitting courses to children 11 and up.  I always told her she had to be atleast 11 to babysit, because of that.  She countered that if she could babysit at 11, she should be able to stay home alone at 10-a good argument, yes, but it did not fly with me.<br>  <br>  Now that she is 11, I have let her stay home alone for a few minutes or babysit for a few minutes (when the one year old is sleeping, and I take her brother with me, because they bicker a lot).  I would never leave her alone nor allow her to babysit for more than a half hour or so.  I would not, at this age, let her babysit anyone else's child for even that amount of time.<br>  <br>  I also would never leave my children with a 10 or 11 year old babysitter.  And, while there are no laws in my state-if something happens, you may still face charges of abuse/neglect.  They have to be able to handle the task, which is difficult to determine-my 11 year old is more mature than some 20-21 year olds I know, and I trust her more with my daughter as well.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Your 10 year old still needs a babysitter herself! She is not remotely old enough to babysit. I wouldn't even let a 12 year old babysit.|`|qlgvecs9aa	R U 4 real ????????????????????????????????????????...<br>  why not to send her to volunteer in the public library or in school<br>  or something like that .<br>  I think somebody has to be crazy to give a child to a 10 years old to watch.<br>  Are you going to help her or she will be by herself ??|`|uLeg1Aniaa	She doesn't have to be twelve but she probably should be.  She is going to have a hard time finding a parent who would let someone that young babysit her kids.  Some ten year olds are still getting babysat themselves.|`|CxCigxZIaa	NOT babysit - but help would be the better word.<br>  I am not sure if there's an actual age for babysitting, except I would ask if she is CPR certified. (something that is very important)|`|rNvXWMOMaa	are you kidding?<br>  at 10 she still needs a babysitter.|`|tL73W0VZaa	I don't know if there is a particular law for babysitting, but I do know that if something were to happen and the police discovered that someone had left a child alone with a ten year old (no matter how responsible) there would probably be some major neglect charges. No responsible adult hires a ten year old to babysit, even if the ten year old is incredibly intelligent, mature, and experienced. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would have her stay at someone's house while one of the parents is home, and hearing distance, (for instance, she plays with a child while the mother is upstairs paying bills, or downstairs doing the laundry). Even then, I wouldn't have her with kids under two or three.|`|kTl39I2gaa	i was babysitting at 10 of course the mom didnt go very far have her start out slow like me id babysit my aunts neighbor's babies when she had to do chores outside or when she went to vist my aunt if she does that at first and as she gets older shell be able to do more but first start off with simple ones like with moms in the neighborhood like if they need to mow the grass or if they wanna chitchat with the neighbor next door that way if anything does go wrong their right next door second get her i n a cpr class cause no one will let her babysit if she cant peform the tasks like the hemlich or cpr even if they are going into the house next door|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	look you are the only one who knows how responsible your 10 year will be. if you feel inside of you that you can leave your 10yr. old babysitting, then you do not need our opinions. you just have to make sure that you leave finger foods for them and you can only be gone no more than a couple of hours. leave the phone at hand and right down the number they can reach you at.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	i think thats kind of young. You can always have them take a class. most places with child birth classes have babysitting classes and that will give them a little more info on how to be a good babysitter and some cpr and first aid stuff to..<br>  <br>  then buy the time there done if they still want to, people will feel better about letting them babysit being so young|`|cXtEx98Haa	Wow.  <br>  <br>  I'm surprised you would ask this.  A babysitter is 100% responsible for the well-being of your child for a period of possibly several hours.  Even with a cell phone you are likely to be up to one hour away from being able to get home if something goes wrong.  My immediate thought is your question borders on child neglect to even consider putting a person so young in charge of you beloved little one.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I think 12 is old enough, but 10!!  No way.<br>  <br>  Added:  Realized you're not asking if a 10 year old can sit for you, rather whether your 10 year old can sit for somebody else.  Take all my thoughts and apply them to any person who might hire her.  Too young either way you go.|`|8oHlIrLOaa	I guess it all depends on who the people that you are babysitting for. It should be up to them. I think that maybe you could come on the babysitting jobs with her because face it, i dont think a 10 year old would know what to do in some of the situations that come up with babysitting. She is still barely a child herself. I know some local hospitals have babysitting courses to become a registered babysitter you could always sign her up for that. good luck!|`|WsUSAgLmaa	Wat difference does it make if she is 12...lol!! Who is she trying to babysit? I wouldnt leave a 10 year old in the house alone unless I was right outside in the front or running to the corner store.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	in most states she isn't even legally allowed to stay home alone. and most people don't even hire 12 year old.|`|UMouJTJeaa	She is 10 she is still a child herself....

50942b910d72a0beef520c6ae49231b1aa	Waking up in the middle of night is a habit. I went through this with my baby too (she is now 10 months old) and I had to do some sleep training. This book really helped me: Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. It basically tells you how important sleep is for babies and kids and gives you different methods of how to get your baby to sleep. If you are not into the cry it out method there are other methods. <br>  <br>  My problem was that everytime Maddie cried, we  would rush in to help her. She never learned how to soothe herself back to sleep. We realized how important it was to teach her to soothe herself and stopped rushing in. We didn't rush in after her crying and it only took like 5 minutes for her to fall asleep. Now there are times when she is really crying that we go to take care of her but we can distinguish those cries from the whining cries. I know your situation is unique as you don't want to wake everyone up but everyone may have to go through a couple of nights of being woken in order to get good sleep moving forwards. I hope you can get the book as it really did help me out.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Change the way he goes to bed. Give him a pacifier, a lovie, whatever, and make him drink his milk while sitting up on the floor and put him in the crib after the milk is gone. If he wakes up at night offer a sippy cup of water. If he throws it, oh well. Start any changes on the weekend so your child can be a little demon on your husband's nights off. Your child is probably waking up at night because he is used to eating then, not because he needs to eat. At 10 months his dinner and a bottle should be enough to hold him over till morning.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Your baby needs naps. The more tired your baby is the worse the night sleep will be. Think about when you get over tired and get that second wind that makes it nearly impossible to settle and fall asleep. Find a new way to settle him to sleep that doesn't involve food, start the new routine at nap time then extend it to bed time as well. There is no quick fix. Pick a routine and stick to it. Make sure you can be home at nap and bed time for a few weeks to work on getting sleep worked out. If you are sure he isn't waking to eat at night use your bedtime settling technique to get him back to sleep again. <br>  <br>  I know a lot of people say that a 10 month old doesn't need to eat at night but I have to disagree. It might be true for 80% of babies but a few of us have babies that just can't make it yet. My 11 month old can't make it more than 6hrs and that's just the way it is. He will go back to sleep without eating before the 6hr mark but after that he is clearly hungry. I can identify because I am the same way and have been known to get up and eat at night.|`|6Swq0iEPaa	When you are about to but him to bed, start playing a different type of song each night until you find one that keeps him clam and happy. That has worked for my sister for her past two children. She especially uses violin solos because the high notes pulls a baby into the song and keeps them to a soft finish. Flute and harp music are also good.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Sounds like HE is the boss...............why are you allowing this to happen?<br>  Cut him down to one nap per day, have him toss ALL of the bottles in the garbage (this way he knows they are gone), give him the sippy cups and get on with your life.|`|d5707a466bbd84ff9d6588fbd5cda26aaa	your baby needs naps. i found that when my son takes longer naps during the day he is happier and sleeps better at night.|`|lpVgMkgcaa	1. one or two naps is normal for his age and you should always let a baby rest when he needs it.<br>  <br>  2. start a routine, bath, book, bottle, bed.  usually read the book while drinking the bottle.<br>  <br>  3. try to let him cry it out when he cries.  try the furber method, it worked great for us.<br>  <br>  4. never put him down with a bottle!  and throw all the bottles away when you are both ready, he will have no choice.  i think it was harder on me than her!|`|2LmfQUbKaa	lol! you poor thing well i had the same problem and yes sorry to tell you your husband is right! I HAVE 2 TEENS NOW and the little one would not sleep at night my grandmother had told me if i kept him up and active threw the day at bed time he will sleep like a rock and it was hard as h*** but it worked you just have to be firm if not he will run the show and you will grow into more problems keep giving him the cup even if he cries show him you are getting reed of the bottles take them and in front of him put them in a bag and act like you are putting them in the trash dont you may need them later and like i said a min ago put your foot down your the boss of this show i know he's your baby and you hate seeing him cry and it may look like he is in pain but he is note stubborn is what it is called! start now mom before it gets out of hand! good luck!|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	My son is now 12 months old and still gets up in the night for a bottle so I know exactly how you feel.  My reasons were for the same, so my husband can sleep for work.  I talked to the Dr about my son so I am sure yours is along the same lines, this is what he said.<br>  <br>  1-2 naps is necessary until they are 18 months to 2 years.  He should be awake for a combined 9-10 hours.<br>  <br>  Your son only gets up at night for a bottle because that is what he is used to and you have always done for him.  Pick a time that will work best for your family and do the 3 nights of crying.  It is really sad and hard to do but it will be worth it. By the 3rd night he will realize you aren't going to give him a bottle and he will give up.<br>  <br>  About an hour before he goes to bed fill him up the best you can with the baby cereal or oatmeal and then right before bed give him a bottle and let him take as much as he wants then put him down.  My Dr calls this a gut bomb.  make him feel full so he wont feel the need to get up.<br>  <br>  Don't be in a hurry to take the bottle away.  Babies have a need to suck till they are about 18 months.  Start phasing it out one bottle at a time till he is getting one right before bed.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp</a><br>   Many babies become constipated when foods are first added to their diet. The main reason for this is that the standard recommended starting foods are all constipating - rice cereal, bananas, squash, and applesauce. Why do health care professionals choose these starting foods when they know they will make most babies constipated? Good question. Even my own Baby Book lists these as starting foods.<br>  <br>  The truth is, there is nothing special about these foods that makes them better to start out with. Babies don't actually even need rice cereal. So, if your baby becomes constipated after starting foods, here is what you can do.<br>  <br>     1. Stop feeding him whatever foods you have started so far.<br>  <br>     2. Introduce a food that you know won't constipated him. Some good suggestions include pureed peaches, prunes, or any green vegetable.<br>  <br>     3. If your baby will not take these foods, or if these foods don't work well enough, try some diluted prune juice through a sippy cup.<br>  <br>     4. Offer water more frequently.<br>  <br>     5. Once baby's stools become more regular again, start adding some of those starter foods again, but in smaller amounts, and less often.<br>  <br>     6. You will need to determine how much of these "loosening" foods your baby needs to keep him regular.<br>  <br>  How do you tell if your baby is truly constipated? Simply stooling less often is not considered constipation. Here are some signs to watch for:<br>  <br>     1. Straining to pass stools - your baby may strain just for a few minutes, or he may strain for hours or days.<br>  <br>     2. Painful stools - if stooling seems to be hurting baby in any way, even if it does not appear unusually large.<br>  <br>     3. Large, hard stools - this is a sign, but only if baby is straining or in pain. Large, hard stools that pass easily are not considered constipation.<br>  <br>  What should you do to relieve the constipation until the loosening foods kick in? If baby is really uncomfortable, you can insert a thermometer about one inch into baby's anus. This will stimulate the anus to open and pass the stool. If this doesn't work, use half of a children's glycerin suppository available over the counter at the drug store.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	If the baby is already contsipated you should try stayong away from a BRAT diet. Bananas, rice, apples and toast(aka white bread). Feed him lots of fiber rich foods. Prunes will help fix it quickly. Also make sure he's getting enough breastmilk or formula. And a little bit of juice in a sippy cup will help move things along. Too much rice cereal can be constipating also because of it's high iron content.<br>  <br>  And if you're breastfeeding it's normal for baby to not poop for a couple of days. It's only constipation if baby has trouble the passing stool or if it's hard.|`|GxMSrrFLaa	I have to argue the point of some of the other answerers. Apple's don't cause constipation. They are full of fiber. That's where the saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away, comes from. Usually if you're regular you're fairly healthy. And apples, or apple juice is recommended for constipation. In a six month old I would dilute the juice if you use it to help though. Its pretty sugary.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	Bananas causes constipation. You can feed him prunes. It'll probably take a day for it to work, but it'll relieve him.|`|lpVgMkgcaa	prunes work like a charm to relieve constipation!  cut back on bananas!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	are u feeding him on a scheduale <br>  do you introduce a new food every 3-5 days <br>  becuase if you are you can answer your own question but if not we cant help you <br>  <br>  but usually bananas are conspating and apples|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Changing to solid foods,means his digestive system reactions will change. If when in fact he does have a bm,if it is not hard,or he wasn't in any pain,or crying during this time. Chances are he wasn't constipated. His body is just changing rhythm.
ggfE4rlvaa	I was having contractions and didn't even know it. They were ONLY in my lower abdomen, very low almost only in my pelvis. I thought contractions would be your whole belly, but no! Sounds like you are laboring, I would give it another 2 hours, or wait for the pain to get worse then go to the hospital. Good luck!|`|ZNTLSCLhaa	I could very well be.  I suggest calling a nurse line from your insurance company or call the hospital and see if they tell you it's time to come in.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|o9u4H6m6aa	It could be early labor. There's really no point in going to the hospital now whether it is early labor or not. It if you were in active labor, you would know it! You wouldn't be asking if you were in labor :><br>  <br>  Whether or not you are in early labor, it's best to go about your day as normally as possible. Do what you would normally do. Rest if you're tired. Be active if you feel like it. Eat and drink as much as you feel like having.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Have Fun !!! :>|`|gEWt6eoCaa	I'm pretty sure it is. Go to the hospital and get checked out.<br>  Congratulations!|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Those could be smaller contractions. I would say that you should definately call the doctor.

Children under 2 do not need to be over medicated.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	If it is a wet productive cough she needs to see a dr to ensure her lungs are clear of mucous. If she is coughing up yellow or green, it could be bronchitis or pneumonia. Either infection could be bacterial or viral, if it is bacterial it can be treated with anti-biotics. You don't say why she is on a puffer, if she has asthma, she should be seen sooner as it is easier for her to have lung problems.|`|AA11602010	mentholatum rub small amount on chest every day and use a germ fighting vaporizer  with a menthol tab or drop a coughdrop in the liquid.<br>  <br>  Or mix a coughdrop around in the milk as you warm it up.|`|cjaWV36Maa	Do you have a sunflower market near you?<br>  <br>  get some oska root.

Di7KqbVQaa	Hey honey.<br>  <br>  I had this from almost the start. You need to get some kind of lotion from the doc ( I just got e45's Itch Cream from the store though!!! My boobs were killing me last night.)<br>  <br>  However i found the best way to cure this is always have a bottle of water with you and drink plenty. You become much more dehydrated when you're pregnant so you need to drink loads more than you used to.|`|53c98641fa37351a0f3c0769f6fd7ddbaa	hey dont worry..its just a reaction from pregnancy hormones..you can speak to ur doctor and he can prescribe a strong lotion or even cream with hydrocortisone in it. as soon as the pregnancy is gone so will skin peeling. it might even disappear in the second trimester.
nAGswgNCaa	well you will probably want to go to your doctor and get a physical then start on prenatal pills. try to eat healthy and enjoy. i suggest the book "what to expect when you're expecting". good luck|`|qisy7yuSaa	first thing tomorrow get to your pharmacist and buy some folic acid, or pregnacare if you can get it (its a multi vitamin with the recommended daily amount of folic acid) you should take either of these right from conception (and trying to conceive) it helps the baby develop, and can reduce risks of abnormalities, the sooner you can take it the better.<br>  <br>  next is to eat health and cut down on junk food if possible, make sure you eat lots of fruit and veg and get lots of protein, then get on ebay and buy yourself a pack of ovulation testing kits (ebay is cheaper and you can buy bulk - they work ive used them and now im 16 weeks pregnant lol) also buy a pack of (decent) pregnancy tests off there, and you can test yourself at home with everything already prepared, rather than having to go to the shops lol!<br>  <br>  it could take a while so remember not to be disheartened, it took me roughly 3 months after coming off the pill before i found out i was pregnant!<br>  <br>  good luck, i hope everything goes well! xxx
vcRm8ps8aa	if the pains are that bad go to the hospital, you could be having an ectopic pregnancy|`|tuXBPrjsaa	take a test.|`|hhocL3aWaa	It is possible that you had an early miscarriage, which is very normal.  Most people will have a miscarriage and never know that they had been pregnant.  So, there isn't anything to worry about here.  Just take something for the pain, and get plenty of rest.  You should feel better soon.  If you were pregnant, you might be able to tell w/ a blood test. But you would have to get it soon.  Don't worry, though.  I had a miscarriage at about 5 weeks pregnant, and now I am 23 weeks, and am doing great.  Also, it could just be a bad period.|`|DlipUzKAaa	if you cramping is severe and bleeding alot you should go to the dr, soon!  I had an ectopic pregnancy that started woth cramping and bleeding a few days prior to my period, not trying to scare you just wanna make you aware that it could be something to look for.
nAGswgNCaa	no form of protection is 100% sweetie so yes there is the possibility of pregnancy. if you have taken a preg test and they are coming back positive then most likely you are pregnant. go to a free clinic or your doctor so that they can test you. good luck|`|aHLUS6i2aa	yeah its poaible that has just happened to me, im 17 weeks now found out when 12weeks was on the implant!!!<br>  also get it out asap, it will not harm the baby i have done reseach spoke to docs ect.|`|Y3Qxgcncaa	abortsion is wrong have a wedding and live with the fact you had premarinal sex.
FHT6wsUpaa	Angela started throwing mini-tantrums about a month ago as well. The worst is when I take away her changing table toy...which is never really a toy (think: medicine dropper, nasal aspirator, digital thermometer, tube of diaper cream, etc). Only the "special" toys will distract her enough to sit still for a diaper change. If she doesn't get one, that's another tantrum.<br>  <br>  Our kids really are a lot alike.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Is it normal for dogs to bark?<br>  <br>  every child is different, my daughter was an angel as a baby and never got into anything or cried unless it was serious. I would tell people how perfect she was and then I got pregnant again. God must have thought it would be funny to off balance my beautiful angel daughter with a screaming, tantrum throwing so. I love that boy like nothing else but I swear he has been throwing himself into fits from the time he was old enough to figure out that when he cried I came running. He is now 2 and I swear if he doesn't get his way he stomps, folds his arms, screams, throws himself to the ground and kicks like nothing else. I have learned to ignore the fits because giving into him while he's having one just makes him use them more to get his way. He's pediatrician told me to start using time outs at his one year check up and as long as I do them properly (tell him no, why it's wrong, and then put him away from it and walk away) he seems to respond. I know that they can be frustrating ans sometimes embarrassing but most everyone around you will know that it's normal so just do what you have to do. Good Luck honey!|`|0QYIbn1saa	Yes, Eli has been having little tantrums since he was about a year old.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yeah i've seen it, and its mostly funny because they can't do it right yet. but you should start to break it before it gets worse.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	my boy loves being in the bath and he's a little over one that could be why?|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	LOL, I was wondering the same thing!  Elyse has been having little tantrums since she was 10 months.  Anytime I redirect her or take away something (bath time here too) she throws herself back and arches and flops around on the floor.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Landon started with his temper tantrums at about 11 months old. He is now 17 months old and he still throws a fit when he can't have something.|`|VbyZZWM7aa	Yeah this is very common specially if he is spoiled! Just walk away and he will get the point!|`|nZVGUzZzaa	my oldest didn't do it till he was about 2 but with in like the last week my ten month old has started doing it, and it is so hard not too laugh because he will do it when we are walking to bed, he drops his feet out from under him and throws his head back and just kinda hangs there, i tell him to knock it off and make him stand back up right and finnish walking to bed, yesterday he did it 4 or 5 times on the way to nap, then he started trying to stomp his feet when he gets mad if we wont let him have something, i tell him no firmly and sit him on the floor and walk away from him, the biggest thing i learned from my older son was to show them that its not ok but walk away don't give them the attention. believe me i know its easier said than done!!|`|HIRYscJlaa	my 7 month old will scream when I try to get him to do something he doesn't feel like ie. put him in the exersaucer, put him in his highchair, move a toy, etc.. I just let him ave his fit and then he usually stops in 30 seconds.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	I remember my daugher would have a temper tantrum when I took her off her sled at that age.  It took me a while to figure out that's what was going on.

Especially with something he loves. It's important to not give in to it. Or he will know exactly how to get what he wants!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Normal in my house, LOL<br>  <br>  And now that he's discovered the fact that he can scream, they are LOUD tantrums!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	my daughter had them at that age.  the pediatrician made the mistake of telling me it could be that shes so smart that its harder for to adjust to issues and handle them.  lol worst thing she could have told me, just feed my big head about how wonderful my daughter is.<br>  seriously she would throw her head down and bang on the floor.  it was a short lived phase and actually *knock on wood* she has been a big temper tantrum girl at 3, so maybe if they go through it early they don't get them so bad when they get older?  although not sure i want to wish that my 18 mo started about 2 or 3 mos ago and well i'm hoping his are short lived too...|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	Oh yes it is! My son experienced the terrible 1s instead of the terrible 2s. It was so frustrating because you can't reason with a one year old as well as you can with a two year old. My son was also big for his age, so when he threw tantrums in public people used to give me dirty looks because they didn't understand that he really was still a baby. He is now 2 and really a very well behaved (albeit a bit hyper) child.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Yep, its normal.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	yeah my daughter does it too. i just dont give in to what she wants and try to distract her|`|X6as2nOAaa	Very normal you just walk away from it and let him throw a fit.
lkhCeAdJaa	As a child development major and with all my experience with children, I can tell you that SOMETIMES those evaluatins and questionairs are not perfect.  Sometimes they miss probelms and other times they indiate problmes when there really isn't one. I hhave personally seen both situations happen.<br>  So having said that here's my advice...don' t buy borrowd worries.  It is very possible (maybe even somewhat likely) that you will have the next round of evaluations done and find that nothing is wrong at all.  This DOES happen quite often.  Decide for yourself that you are not going to totally stress over something that may not even be true.<br>  Second: if there IS a problem (and again, I cn't stress to you how OFTEN these evaluations are incorrect in their initial stages), it doesn't mean you are  failure.  Think about how often we as parents are told NOT to compare our children to every other child because development in children has such a wide range of 'normal'.  If that is the case, then it is very plausable that a parent could miss something.  Knowing that one child may be able to accomplish (fill in blamk) and another child can't, but that both are normal, how can we know when it indicates a problem and when it doesn't?  We can't.  That's the purpose for these evaluations. Because parents are not expected to know what is developmentally within the range of 'normal' and what isn't. Being a parent doesn' t make one a child development profssional. Stop beating yourself for possibaly having missed something.  Your son is only 2!!  Two year olds vary SO MUCH...it would take a professional to see something that wasn't outright obvious.<br>  But again, DO NOT believe that there is a problem until further tests are done.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Until you have any further information to go with, I would not spend a whole lot of time feeling bad.  Besides, just because a questionnaire says something doesn't mean you can't get a second opinion.|`|AA11481889	Rule Number ONE in parenthood.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  Have confidence in your skills as a parent and trust yourself.<br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  All kids develop at different rates, and they are using a statistic to measure our children.  <br>  <br>  Not every child fits into their "averages"...<br>  <br>  You can't beat yourself up, when your perfectly healthy child may come back outside the "norm" that has been established by statistical data.  <br>  <br>  You also have to take into consideration that children behave differently with strangers...so this "developmental/sensory" issue, may also be a misinterpretation.<br>  <br>  Personally, for me, I tend to be an old school hardass when it comes to health, my own and my family's<br>  <br>  I think that kids are WAY WAY WAY too scrutinized in this day and age and everyone is WAY too willing to chuck specialists and pharmaceuticals at their kids these days.<br>  <br>  Kids are quirky...they are all different...that doesn't necessarily mean that there is anything "wrong" with them.<br>  <br>  If you and your husband and your pediatrician all think he's ok...I wouldn't put too much stock in a standardized test and I certainly wouldn't be beating myself up about it.  <br>  <br>  It is what it is...IF there is something off, then you're a great mom for having surrounded yourself with child development professionals that caught it, and if he's just fine, then you're doing a great job already.<br>  <br>  Either way, he's getting the care he needs...so chin up mommy, it's all good.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  FYI - Keep in mind that doctors can also be totallyfullofshit.  <br>  <br>  My friend here at work, had an amnio when she was pregnant, and her gyno looked at the results and told her, "I'm so sorry, I wish you and the baby my best.  (After indicating that he was sorry that her baby had downs syndrome)"  <br>  <br>  As it turned out, she had the results reviewed by a genetic specialist, that her baby was 100% fine....<br>  <br>  Moral of the story...don't trust everything that you're told....and tests can be misinterpreted.  <br>  <br>  Don't sell the farm and second guess your mothering skills, just because someone you don't know tells you that you should.|`|j2mRop0laa	I learned very quickly when I had my first daughter that there will be people and professionals that like to throw their opinions around with little evidence. My daughter had a health issue and was born premature. The doctors told me that she would be very short and probably "slow." I finally found a doctor that gave me the best piece of advice. He said, "Ignore them. You are a good mother and if something arises that has YOU concerned, then address it. Everyone will be happy to "diagnose" her before she can even walk.<br>  Let me tell you- my daughter is ten, 4.0 student, tallest in her class and never had any issues with learning whatsoever.<br>  Take her opinions with a grain of a salt. Have him evaluated, get some opinions and take what you like- ignore the rest. Sometimes people are flat out wrong.<br>  If they are right, then just do what you can to get him on track in a relaxed calm reassured way. It isn't your fault. Just work with him and he will be fine. You say you have never had any concerns before? Maybe she got him on a bad day, you know?|`|KeUGwKndaa	did you get these question from your doctor or did you get this survey off your computer . did it come in the form of mail or by phone you have to learn that a mother knows best for their children.what i have read about you and your son you have been a great on this end. but you do drive yourself crazy know one will ever get it 110% right. just follow your heart you can't go wrong.|`|AA12145826	Okay....you need to stop beating yourself up over this. They are basing their answers and concerns for your child on a piece of paper you may have not understood fully when you filled it out. Once they evaluate him in person, they will see that everything is fine. And YOU will see everything is fine. You're not failing at this whole motherhood thing, as evidenced by the fact that you CARE about your child.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Oh your not hon. Is this a online survey or one from your doctors office? If your doctor doesn't have any worries and neither do you then hes fine. Children all learn differently and boys are a little slower. If it was an online survey i dont know how much i would believe that, it may be a scam. Call a mother and tell her that her child is slow in an area and you pay money to fix something that isnt even there. Of course your husbands upset, some one is telling him that his litttle man is different and there is something wrong with him. If you have only started feeling this way because of a survey then talk to your child doctor and he will steer you in the right way if somethings wrong or tell you its nothing.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I think any GOOD parent feels guilty in these situations.  I was the same when my son was diagnosed with TS, even though that is totally out of my control.  Don't panic until you've actually gotten a diagnosis of some type from a qualified dr......if you even need one.  Not every child develops at the same rate and to heck with anyone who tries to make you feel like you don't know your child!  If there is a disorder going on with your son, all you can do is keep on supporting and loving him through it...and know that YOU are doing what you are supposed to as mommy!  Good luck to you!!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	You haven't noticed any problems in his developmental & sensory areas.  Your pediatrician hasn't, either.  <br>  <br>  Your responses to a questionaire have lead someone you don't know and who doesn't know your child to statistically (because what else do they have to go on?) think that there's something that needs to be checked out more closely.  <br>  <br>  Have you ever filled out one of those 'Which Disney Character are you?' questionnaires on line?  Did your answers make you think that you might, actually, be Daisy Duck?<br>  <br>  It's possible, of course.  But, until you get a more personal, detailed evaluation, I wouldn't go out and take swimming lessons just yet.  <br>  <br>  And, 'developmental and sensory' concerns could mean anything at all.  At the age of two, any 'milestone' is just a guess - every child progresses differently, reaches those milestones at different times.  You know that if there were something *big*, something *really wrong* that you or your doctor would have noticed by now.  <br>  <br>  If it were me, I would feel the same way, though.  And, I don't think I'd be waiting for an appointment next week.  I'd be calling them back, asking for more details about their concerns, doing my own research on line & with my doctor, and doing my own tests & observations at home.  Even if it didn't help make progress, it would occupy my time & my mind until the actual appointment with the professionals.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Oh geez, did my troll attack you???<br>  <br>  I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  Anyways - YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE!

1f8c660f42fb2996d0008deba351015daa	I have a 7 year old step daughter as well.  My husband and I would be furious if she came to our house with a cell phone.  First of all because we'd want to know how her mother can afford it, but that's a different issue all together.  But really, our philosophy is that it's our house, our rules.  <br>  <br>  There is no reason she would need a cell phone.  She knows full well that if she wants to call someone - anyone (mom, included) - all she has to do is pick up the home phone and dial.  If she is at a friend's house and needs to call us, I guarantee you that friend's parent would be accommodating.  That's how it is when you have little girls.  Same goes with any school outing or function she would be at.  If she really really needs to call us, she would be allowed.  No need for a cell phone.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Step up to the plate and act like a loving father - demand she leave the cell phone home when she visits with you.<br>  I'd also have a conversation with her mother - demand that if she insists on giving the 7-year old a cell phone - it be one with only a couple of buttons on it (which are programmed) and be used for emergencies only.|`|MAABo1zKaa	honestly, its a cell phone. It may seem ridiculous but there are positives to it. She is 7 so it will not be a constant Habit just a form of communication. my friend  got her son a cell phone and he is 8, i thought it was absurd but after talking with her it became more logical. it is a form of communication, if there was ever an emergency she would have it. as a child (god forbid0 anything hapened to her that cell phone could save her. as long as she is not abusing it or being unreasonable about it i see no harm in her having it.|`|sK9c50iCaa	Ask your husband if that is ok to say to her and if he agrees to it. But it should be more up to the biological mother if she has one and it is up to the father if she can use it at his house. ( if he says no she might not come back.)|`|tBtOTiQDaa	wow,<br>  thats ridiculous<br>  i think you shouldn't ban it all together, that might cause resentment, but limit it to a few minutes a day, and take it away when she goes to school|`|AA11573305	I think its ok for her to have a emergency phone not to play around with i was 11 when I got my first phone.So I say it is ok but to a line.|`|AXEqOEloaa	So who cares if she thinks you are mean? You are the parents she is the child, set your rules.|`|RKTNDLDKaa	I agree that it is a tad ridiculous.   However, if I were a mother and sending my daughter away every other weekend to visit your home, I would want immediate access to talk to her.   I don't think that you and your husband are bad people and she may not think that either, she may just want to be able to call her daughter whenever she wants to without having to call your home number or your cell numbers.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes, the school system is not real great about notifying parents or allowing students to call home.     Maybe her mother wants to know if there's an early out at school; if she feels badly (the school won't let a child call home unless they vomit or have a fever---and you can feel sick without vomiting or having a fever); if she misses the bus, she needs to be able to call to have someone pick her up.        <br>  <br>  If she is going home with friends or staying the night with friends, maybe her mother wants immediate access to her.     I can remember driving out to a family's home because I had been trying to call my daughter who was spending the night, but could not call all night because someone in the house was on the internet (dial up--rural area) and I worked myself into a panic.      The other thing is that a lot of people don't have land lines anymore and calling the other parents' cell phones is not always reliable.     Therefore, I like my 10 year old having a cell phone.    That way, I can call her if I want; and if she needs/wants me to come get her, I will know immediately.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't ban the cell phone at your home unless it becomes a problem.    There's no need for her to be on it all the time.     There's no need for her to be texting.     I would just ignore the fact that she has it, unless the issue needs to be addressed.|`|WadhFqOJaa	Why not comrpomise and limit the use if it, It is in your house and therefore fall under your rules. I gave my 8-1/2 year old step daughter a prepaid phone. She only takes it when she's going to a friends house so we can call her. Anyother time there is no need for it and it is turned off. This way she feels good about having her own phone yet we have full control over it.|`|nTHPuF5Caa	She is only 7...! Dont b worried about it.<br>  Get her a barbie or a barbie house...<br>  Buy any toy she wants but don't let this kid grow like this.<br>  What I mean is that she's just a little girl, <br>  U guys should not allowed it...<br>  <br>  Please don't...<br>  <br>  <br>  Luck with that.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	you know I firmly believe all children should have a cell phone, for one reason. GPS tracking.  If something God forbid should happen, their cell phones can be pinged to determine their location.  All 3 of my children have cell phones:age 10, 9, and 7.<br>  :)|`|zVdVGsoJaa	If you make the rule of no cell phone usage in the house, that is your call (sorry, no pun intended...lol...).  But you should follow this rule too, so that it isn't viewed as unfair.  After all, you probably have a perfectly good home phone to use.  You're not mean, just sensible.  But since her mom is paying for it, I don't advise you take it away, unless she is grounded or in trouble...|`|HSUfe3m7aa	This is a tough one. I may get my child a child's cellphone at that age for when he's leaving school or at activities so he can call me.<br>  <br>  If the cellphone is being used to "spy" at Dad's house (as it so often is), take it away when she gets there. Your house, your rules.<br>  <br>  If you have every other weekend visits, her mom doesn't need to get ahold of her anyways. Just tell her to keep it at home, that her and Daddy's time is special and you don't need a phone interrupting it. What the mom thinks has no bearing at your house.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	My 10 year old and 8 year old got cell phones this Christmas.  They are not allowed to take them to school, but they can use them at home when we are around or when we are not around, but drop them off at an activity it's nice to know they can reach us right away with the touch of a button if they need to.  The phone is set up so only pre-programmed people can call the phone and only pre-programmed people can be called from the phone.<br>  <br>  I would suggest to your stepdaughter that she may use it except for at night or during meal times etc.  I wouldn't make a big fuss over it because the novelty wears off pretty quick.  trust me.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No,but I would limit her use. To certain times of the day,and to only friends and family that you know. <br>  <br>  I understand and agree that seven years old is way to young for a cell phone,but taking it away could create conflict with her mother,and I think it's best to try and avoid that if at all possible. She clearly seems to not have good parenting judgment,hence giving a seven year old a cell phone..|`|qlgvecs9aa	you set your rules in your house.<br>  If you do not want her to use it while she is there tell her BUT don't be rude or anything like that. <br>  Try to explain her nice and relaxed that cell phones are not allowed and try to give her an convincing explanation of why not !!<br>  If your husband agrees I do not see the problem.<br>  <br>  and i agree with you that that is ridiculous !!
046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Between your tragic miscarriage and this pregnancy you delivered a healthy baby.  Focus on that.  Every pregnancy is different.  Cramping is normal in the first trimester for a lot of women.  If you don't see any bright red spotting just rest and try not to worry.  If you do, head for the nearest emergency room.  <br>  <br>  Doctors may not seem as responsive to you as you like on this issue because there is little (possibly nothing) they can do to prevent a miscarriage this early in a pregnancy.  Drugs designed to stop labor are only used for viable fetuses.  This early along if your body rejects the pregnancy it is considered best since something is likely very wrong with the embryo.  This is science and has nothing to do with the emotional toll such an event brings.  Doctors can empathize, but that won't help you retain a pregnancy your body wants to reject this early. <br>  <br>  Calm down and wait for your appointment unless you have real signs of miscarrying that I mentioned earlier.  You and your husband are in this together and yelling at him won't help you or the pregnancy.  Just let him know your fears and that you want his support.  Ask him to hold you and tell you everything will be all right if that is what you need. <br>  <br>  Pray for a positive outcome and exercise your faith by remaining calm.  Best wishes for you and your family.  What is supposed to happen will.
UKmZcA30aa	My labor started on a Monday night. I was sent to the hospital monday for high blood pressure but they sent me home. I had contractions all day tuesday. Mine were ten minutes apart and 30sec long. the pain was like a 2 as well, just cramping. i called the doctor when the pain got to like a 5, but the contractions were still ten minutes apart. the doctor told me to call back when they were 5 min apart and a minute long. I swear i hung up the phone and bam, they were 5 min apart and a minute long. lol so i waited a couple hours and called again so they told me to go in. they sent me home again because there was no change. They sent me home at 3 in the morning and by 7 i couldnt take the pain so they sent me back to the hospital... but i took my time getting there because i wanted to make sure i had changed. i got to the hospital at 11ish and i had the baby at 3, by emergency c-section.  good luck! =]|`|hLvSnWrtaa	A lot of women deliver at 38 weeks.  If they are 5 minutes apart you could really be going into labor.  My OB always told me to contact them or go to the hospital when the contraction were less than five minutes apart for more than an hour.  Sounds like you might be having a baby sooner rather than later.  Good Luck!|`|MtC3CWZraa	I had my first round of false labor on 2/05 and have had several rounds since then. I was due last Thursday and am still pregnant. False labor isn't much of a sign of when the real thing will happen.|`|wLG2vjSbaa	With my son I had almost the same thing happen. I had it for two weeks though. Finally my doctor told me to walk and walk and walk so I did and guess what?

Actually, the more I think about it... 5 or 6 times.<br>  <br>  My youngest was around 9 or 10 months and that was the only time (didn't go well).  Edit, he did also at 7 months old (on our anniversary).|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Dylan was at least a year old before he spent overnights with Gramma. I struggled with it bigtime. I really just couldn’t go out and enjoy myself. What fun is it to go and have dinner with my husband if we’re BOTH talking about the baby and what color poop he has and both wondering if we should call to check on him again?? <br>  <br>  But now that he’s older, we have no problem dropping him at Gramma’s house. Although we do still talk about him and miss him to pieces while we’re gone. <br>  <br>  It’s hard leaving your little one. Especially as a working parent, I feel guilty taking time for myself with my husband  when my little man is at home with Gramma. Even if he’s asleep. LOL.|`|TQW5E6olaa	She's 20 months, and never spent a night away from me. We've had a week in the hospital but I stay with her.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	21 months old, when I was at the hospital giving birth to his sister.  <br>  <br>  He's 9 now, just had his first sleepover at a non-relative's house a couple weeks ago.

So, she totally loves to spoil my boys and she works full time.  When she has a day or two off, she steals one or both of them from me.  My oldest was three weeks old the first time she stole him.  It's nice, it lets me get some sleep and get some cleaning done.  And me and hubby get to have some alone time.|`|j2mRop0laa	Mine were both a little over a year before they stayed with grandparents.<br>  <br>  <br>  No wait... my youngest was 8 months because my husband had to take a business trip and needed me with him to take phone calls and schedule appointments.

vue9NOhYaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  He never *needed* cereal at all. If he enjoys it and it doesn't constipate him, continue for as long as you wish.  Or move onto other, more grown-up foods. (You could give adult oatmeal/cream of wheat, or other breakfast foods -- yogurt, pancakes, dry cereal, and so on.)|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My son is 15 months old and he still has his Gerber oat meal before bed, every night. It keeps him happy and from having hunger pains in the middle of the night. I mean, if the box has recipes on it for meatloaf...I'm thinking it's okay to still give him, lol. I believe you can it to him up until 4 years old.|`|0JHqXKciaa	He doesn't need it it's just what everyone usually starts feeding baby at 10 months he is probably eating a lot of table food and such so I really don't think it's necessary for you to feed cereal anymore if you don't want to.  His tastes should be expanding well beyond baby cereal at that age.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i would try to mix it up if he will eat other things with out chocking give it to him! my son is now 16 when he was a baby a premi at that he was 5mnths old eating rice beans chicken anything he could get his hands on so you will know!|`|Emw1PBqXaa	You don't have to keep up with the baby cereal. Just make sure he is getting the iron elsewhere then.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	whenever you want. <br>  it probably fills him up though.
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	I absolutely love the gdiapers.  www.gdiapers.com  .  but if you were going to do a cloth diaper i guess i would personally use a fitted one.  you can usually find them pretty cheap second hand.  if you still wanted to use the flat fold diapers, i would prolly use a disposable doubler kind, you're going to end up with too much laundry as is.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Cotton prefold diapers work great most of the time. The problem I ran into was the bulkiness, clothes these days don't allow the extra room for cloth diapers. I had a hard time fitting one prefold in my son's clothes and can't imagine doubling up. I did have a small problem with leaks, my son could pee out of a prefold in 30min. Yes you always need a cover but you can reuse covers. For a newborn you might want 5-6 because they do need to be changed if poop leaks onto it. After you start solid foods 4 should be plenty. I like thirsties covers personally, they are soft and do the job. Snappis are great, I remember using pins on my brothers and hated them. Medium size covers will last the longest. My son moved to medium at 4 months and is still in them at 11 months. From what I understand most average size kids will stay in medium until they are potty trained.<br>  <br>  You might get a few nicer more absorbent diapers for going out of the house. I found that prefolds sometimes needed to be changed frequently and having a good diaper on out of the house worked well not to mention the clothing issue. The bumgenius one size diapers are great and work well for us. I picked them up second hand on craigslist.com to cut the cost. Three was plenty although I liked them so much I got more later on. I also use them at night now that my son is older. When they start sleeping more at night you need a diaper to hold more they come in handy. Hemp, mircrofiber, or bamboo hold a lot more than cotton without the bulk. For prefolds we switched to bamboo from pandatushies.com. Again I have a heavy wetter and found that cotton just didn't do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. We love using cloth but do use our occasional disposable as they do come in handy as well.|`|wURg3jBcaa	Hate to burst your bubble- cloth diapers aren't better for  the environment- the energy needed to heat the water to sterilize the diapers is bad too...or if you're using a diaper service, there's the issues of gas and pollution from transporting the diapers.<br>  <br>  It is good for your baby though, and easier to potty train- but not much better for the environment.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your diapering.|`|kevLD4P2aa	Cloth diapers are great, regardless of environmental impact! They're cheaper (by far) and your baby shouldnt ever have diaper rash! People have been using them for ages. Dyes and glues in disposable diapers can cause allergic reactions and babies have actually choked on pieces of disposables that come apart! I found this from cloth planet.com "Disposable diapers generate sixty times more solid waste and use twenty times more raw materials, like crude oil and wood pulp."<br>  "The manufacture and use of disposable diapers amounts to 2.3 times more water wasted than cloth."<br>  "Over 300 pounds of wood, 50 pounds of petroleum feedstocks and 20 pounds of chlorine are used to produce disposable diapers for one baby EACH YEAR."<br>  If you really want to know about diapers on the environment, check out this page <a href="http://www.realdiaperassociation.org/diaperfacts.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.realdiaperassociation.org/dia...</a><br>  now, on to your questions:<br>  Like Melissa said, I have tried "doubling" but often cant fit my baby into his clothes! a pre-purchased doubler can be handy since its less bulky but if you fold the diaper to absorb most of the moisture (and have your diaper cover) you should be fine! You can re-use the diaper cover. I started out with about 4 or 5 of them for by baby. I loved the snappis just make sure that you follow the manufacturer's instructions on inspecting them for damage and replacement.

hKJIDdVqaa	surely he will not die going to school with a sinus infection or allergy problem.  No he cannot keep staying home. Give him a claritin and a teaspoon of local honey and send him on his way. He is missing way too much school and falling into bad habits for the future.  And his DR is not going to keep bringing him into the office for allergies. It is what it is. Some have allergies, some do not.  Do some research on natural cures for allergies and see a specialist.  Benadryl will no solve his problem, but rather he will become immune to it and it will be of no help.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Yes switch doctors. The repeat infections and problems can result in long term damage and even death if severe enough. Long time sufferer who had to have reconstruction done because of the damage.|`|wLFM00iiaa	you may want to consider home schooling. try a tutor or similar. if he is seriously ill you could have it full time. the other option is getting work brought home from school by friends. you don't want him to fall behind his class|`|36PrVK7Oaa	I missed a lot of school at that age also and almost was held back a grade. I got over it though and everything turned out fine. I would ease up on the medication.|`|5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	I think you're right in looking to see if another doctor might have better answers for you.  I also agree with another poster that you shouldn't keep him out of school as long as he's not contagious and doesn't have a fever.  This site may have additional information for you that you haven't come across before: <a href="http://www.kids-ent.com/newkids800/sinusprint.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kids-ent.com/newkids800/sinus...</a>|`|f6526244f4eebe959379baecf04684a1aa	yes, consider taking him to a different primary care if you cant get a referral at this point.  My 6yo also has missed school for allergies last year.  When I mentioned to the allergist that I thought she might need to each year the allergist was pretty adamant that we should alter our meds/ treatment to try to keep her in school now that she is in 1st.  There really are a lot of options so it helps to have someone who takes some time.<br>  For what it is worth we have had some luck this year with nasal rinses in addition to daily nasonex and zyrtec.<br>  If you like your pcp otherwise I would call again and recap that it has been so many visits and such a variety of treatments already.  not everyone with allergies needs to see an allergist, but some do.|`|ECQwlHfKaa	You could do the homeschooling thing, but the deal is you still won't know what exactly is bothering him allergy wise. He needs to see an allergist because they can tell you exactly what he is allergic to and prescribe stronger/better antihistamines. I am 35, and when I moved to Arizona I was sick with bronchitis at least 6 times in a year--severe enough to need steroid medications just to breathe. I had to get tested, and they do skin tests--not gonna lie for someone young (and I did this when I was 4 years old too) it can be scary because they prick the skin with the allergens and then see how the skin reacts, which is how they can tell what exactly you are allergic to. I have to get weekly injections of the allergens to build up my immune system to everything I am allergic to, while at the same time taking my asthma medications and allergy medications. For the first time in two years my allergist told me my asthma was under control. So if your little one is sick that often, get a different PCP and get that referral. No child should have to suffer like that. Good luck!
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I support the death penalty, but not for a kid, obviously. I do think he has the brains to understand the gravity of the situation, though. I think perhaps a detainment facility somewhere until he reaches the legal age, maybe. Then move him into a regular facility. I'm not really sure. But I know this isn't the first time something like this has happened - and just because they're kids doesn't mean they don't understand or are incapable of doing something this awful. What I don't agree with are those who have killed and then are let go once they reach adulthood - as in the case of the two British kids who murdered a toddler a while back. They were then given new identities and released back into the public. <br>  <br>  This link may be upsetting to some - I know it was to me - so read with caution. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_J...</a>|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	That happened near me! (I live outside of Pittsburgh).<br>  <br>  I definately think he should face some type of jailtime. An 11 yar old KNOWS not to shoot people with a gun! And it was HIS gun (I'm assuming for hunting) and he should've had a gun saftey course and been taught not to shoot people. It was col-blooded premeditated murder. AND then he went off to school like nothing happened....leaving the 4 year old alone with her dead mother!<br>  <br>  That kid has to have serious mental issues for him to viciously murder his soon-to-be step-mother. <br>  <br>  I DO think he should go to jail until he's 21, then evaluated to see if he should be released into society again.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You can't give the death penalty to an 11 year old, even if they murder 100 people and laugh about it for days their age protects them.<br>  <br>  He should go to adult prison though and he should get two counts of murder since at 8 months the baby could have survived on its own. I'd say 40-50 years in jail should be enough.|`|j2mRop0laa	I just don't see enough evidence that he did it, from that news story. Sorry. I just imagine my 5th grader and her classmates and I can't imagine them doing that and spending their whole lives in prison. I'm so sad about this. <br>  I think if he did it then he needs some counseling. How will punishment help? Honestly.. this is beyond punishment phase. He still has a chance to contribute to society if they get him help now.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	If it was in self defense then no punishment, you'd shoot some one who broke into your house or was trying to beat you. <br>  <br>  But they should do it like they would to an adult, psychological evaluation to see if they are sane or not, then tried, not as an adult because well as adults are always saying children are not adults so shouldn't be treated as such, that logic doesn't just apply to situations where it benefits adults.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wonder why every one is so much more strict on children murderers.|`|9QC1MD4Naa	I think any child over the age of 8 knows that murdering someone is wrong, therefore, should be tried like an adult.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in the death penalty and I don't see why the child would get the death penalty simply because he's a child. He should have the same rights anyone else would...|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Well, since spanking is illegal, why don't we try them as adults? <br>  Who wants more government control?? I say we get what we asked for. Adult prison??? God forbid! Does anybody know what happens if you put a kid in an adult prison? Sure, why don't we make a victim out of him now? He'll come out in so many years, all raped and sodomized! Does anybody here have kids? He should pay for it, and it should be a correctional program. But don't stick him in with all the 'adult' maniacs!|`|prqrQcd1aa	Kenzie and I use to be friends when I was younger and living in New Castle, PA. I am very disturbed by all of this, and I can not believe that this has even happend. I have not gotten to speak with her in several years..but my old college room mate and I were actually thinking about going to visit some of our old friends. <br>  I think the boy is a child, and the whole family is devistated.. Find out why he felt the need to harm her and get him the help that he obviously needs! Putting him in jail will not solve the problem that made him do this horrible act in the first place.....

I've been hearing about it more and more these days. I would think that the child should serve time in both prison (juvenile) and a mental institution, and then be moved to state prison when he gets older. <br>  <br>  How sad for the poor girls' children and her unborn child :(|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	They should be interviewed by a psychologist. And if the evidence suggests it was premeditated. They should be tried as an adult. <br>  Just because they're are younger and have 'angelic' faces doesn't mean they are exempt to facing the consequences of their actions.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Same as adults.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	well can a court find him guilty or not before we start figuring out what we "are going to do to him?"|`|KSK22vHUaa	At his age, his father should share some of the responsibility for the crime.  I realize a parent cannot be responsible for a child's every action, but murder is a different story.<br>  <br>  The kid needs some therapy, clearly.  He should be punished, but more than that he needs to be helped.  At 11, no child should be thinking about murder--something is very wrong in this child's life that he should come to that action.|`|ThnKiLfTaa	In my own personal opinion, I think that an 11 yr old CHILD should not be treated as an ADULT would. Simply because their NOT adults. I think the child should at least be given the chance at rehabilitation, instead of locking him away and throwing away the key. OK so the kid obviously has some problems that need to be dealt with, but do you seriously think that throwing an 11 yr old boy in prison with grown men is going to help him? ABSOLUTELY not!!! Should he pay for his crime? Absolutely! But NOT in an adult prison! In a juvenile facility where for 1. he will be safer than being in an adult prison and 2. he can be able to get the psychiatric help he needs.|`|cteyFJxhaa	I'm not real keen on the whole rehabilitation thing.  <br>  <br>  The truth is that a lot of kids do this kind of crap and they know it's wrong but they don't care because they also know that the young offenders act (that's what it's called here, not sure about the rest of you) will protect them.  Do you realize what that means????  That they kill because they have no fear of repercussion and no guilt for the act itself.  <br>  <br>  Adults may in a heated moment go out of control.  Or they may plan it out and hope for the best but know that they may get caught and go to jail......they think it through and take the chance anyway.<br>  <br>  These kids, have no regard for human life.<br>  <br>  Des, I usually like your answers but on this one I totally disagree.  I would LOVE to believe that deep down every child is good and deserves a second chance but I can't lie to myself like that.  We've got to start making examples of some of these kids and scaring some of them straight.<br>  <br>  Add:  I wonder if you'd all be so soft if it was your kid who got shot in a drive by, or beat into a coma over an ipod.  I'm not suggesting that every kid who breaks the law is scum and we should throw every kid who gets caught drinking under age in jail.  But I am saying that we have to start seeing the difference between "mistakes" and "violent crimes".  They are not the same thing.|`|EvIWKqpDaa	I am not exactly thrilled with the idea of them charging an 11 as an adult. I'd have no problem if he were 15 or 16, but 11 is a bit much. <br>  That being said if he is convicted as an adult, they should put him in juvenile hall until 18 and then into a prison. <br>  Although I would not be surprised if he is placed in psychiatric facility.|`|1enIWBGnaa	I feel really sorry for the 11- year old because he did this due to his environment; how he was raised.  I feel the boy needs years of therapy, should be placed in foster care and the father should go to prison.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Same as anyone who kills!!!|`|eqENvJUVaa	This is one of the key issues in Juvenile Justice today. I seriously doubt that he will receive life in prison. The problem that I see with the world of juvenile justice today is the lack of mental health resources for the young. As in the case of most murders, we don't know the circumstances of his life and can only make presumptions about the way he went about dealing with his problem. Did you know violent crimes committed by juveniles increased 10-fold between 1951 and 1990? Some studies suggest that 70% of juvenile offenders are mentally ill and do not receive treatment. There are cases where parents call the cops on their children so that they receive mental health care from YDC or whatever the juvenile system is referred to in their area because they cannot afford treatment for their child's problem. <br>  <br>  And, yeah, many people do not believe in mental illness, but, until you have read up on, don't discount it. Depression, schitzophrenia, bipolar, substance abuse problems, DID, ADHD, and PTSD are all problems that plague juvenile offenders in considerable amounts. <br>  <br>  All of these untreated disorders can lead to individual harm, or harm to others. Who is to say that this child was not abused, physically, psychologically or sexually at any point in his life? His father was not even married to this woman who was killed, which is a perceived deviation from societal norms. Perhaps he bred animosity from that. Perhaps he was emotionally neglected. Perhaps he had fetal alcohol syndrome. We don't know what is going on. Perhaps he has a history violence that has never been treated.  <br>  <br>  This child has done a great wrong. He has killed two humans. He should be punished; he will be punished. I understand that part. But did he truly understand his actions? Is he a sociopath? Or was he pushed to a point where he was in a perceived danger? We do not know this child, and, as the public, have no right to bring a judgment upon him because we do not know the full details of his life. And that is what divides a lifetime in prison from a life of mental treatment.<br>  <br>  P.S. I found the story but the link didn't work for some reason.|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	I see this is going to be the hot topic today.  :)<br>  an 11 year old should not be tried as an adult, and most certainly not executed.  I am actually very opposed to the death penalty even for adults, but for children?  How barbaric of a society are we?  We need to focus on what to do with these children, whether it be counselling, therapy, drugs... . It is a sad story, and again reinforces my belief that the US needs stricter gun laws.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I'm sure a bunch of people on here will tell you that, too.<br>  <br>  We should treat kids with major problems like kids with major problems, not like adults.  And we should be doing a lot more to help at-risk kids so they don't go down that road to begin with.<br>  <br>  To me, it's absolutely wrong, regardless of the crime, to put an 11-year-old in an adult jail, to kill a child for something they did, or to give a sentence to a child that doesn't even allow for the possibility of rehabilitation.<br>  <br>  <br>  *eta -- and what s@hm said!

yrF1q1mdaa	Go to Motherhood Maternity and get the Secret Fit Jeans, they are amazing! They come in XS, S, M, L, and XL and they fit fantastically well. You can't tell they are maternity jeans and they are not baggy or anything. They only cost $25-35 depending on the style and type of jean. A friend recommended them to me and as soon as I put on a pair I was in love and ended up getting 2 pairs of jeans, 1 pair of jean capris, and 1 pair of jean shorts in them. You'll love them, I promise!|`|vjoyv5J6aa	I am in LOVE with Ross. They have tons of maternity stuff at 1/5 of the price. I get jeans for less than $14. At that price you can try a few different styles to see what you like. I like the ones that go up to the bra line. I got a pair of khakis from Kohls. I got a maternity shirt from Ross for $ .49 yesterday! Oh yeah.<br>  <br>  Places like Ross carry a variety of brands, that's why I like it. They bring all the stores to you and you don't have to drive around! .... and the prices kick butt.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Hmmmm I used to be a size 7 before I got pregnant.  And now, almost 7 months postpartum I'm still a size 11.  Your whole body will shift and change....but I would say that Motherhood Maternity has some really cute stuff.  Some of their stuff I can still wear now, since it doesn't even look like maternity stuff.  At the end of my pregnancy, I LOVED the full-panel belly pants.  SO comfortable!  Old Navy has some really cute stuff too.  I could even find some cute affordable stuff at Target and at Burlington Coat Factory too.  Good luck and I hope you have a great pregnancy!  :)|`|1MEnCmwoaa	that is hard. i am not as small as you but i had that probably with my first pregnancy with a lot of pants. the butt and thighs were so baggy it looked ridiculous! <br>  i saw at a pea in the pod (expensive though) they had like slim fit jeans. <br>  old navy also has maternity jeans that are fitted instead of super loose. <br>  good luck!|`|FNBXTLj5aa	Old Navy has some decent stuff. One note, I preferred the waistband that you can adjust with the buttons vs. the elastic kind. The elastic kept falling down and I was constantly hitching up my pants.|`|VWFFKganaa	H&M has good maternity jeans that come in small sizes|`|44OH7Si6aa	Old Navy and Gap offer as small as size 0, Target also carries a XS that you could try out and motherhood maternity online carries small sizes. Also there is a brand called Zero2Nine that you could try out the best places to look for them are small maternity clothes boutiques but you may be able to find them online. Honestly though, I go in to be induced in 3 days and I still wear my pre-pregnancy jeans with my bellaband and I haven't found it uncomfortable yet|`|MtC3CWZraa	I've come to the conclusion that no maternity pants really look good on anyone. :-)  I think there's a conspiracy to make sure our rears look bad.<br>  <br>  That said, I think that Gap/Old Navy maternity goes as small as size 0 on line.  I just wouldn't suggest buying too many pairs at once since you never know where you'll put on the weight as you progress through your pregnancy.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	Old Navys jeans fit me perfectly and I am normally 1-3 as well.  Also Motherhood makes 1 or 2 styles that are smaller cut, I dont remember the names but if you go there just ask them.  Old Navy sells jeans called "real waist" that have expanders inside but still are purchased using your regular jean size, I have a pair in size 1 and they are awesome!!|`|v3LnJycKaa	kin dof in the same boat, on the regular i wear a size 5, but i have very thin legs, but hips, when i am in maternity I buy the low waiste regular old navy maternity jeans in a 0 and they fit like a dream!|`|09061e5674207e8f8a877ca8a18d54f5aa	Dont worry i have the same problem as you do.....I have gotten my clothes(jeans) from Target...they have a wide range of maternity clothing for all sizes of women including tops for us smaller women...GOOD LUCK!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Old Navy has maternity jeans in actual number sizes so you can get the correct fitting (they have size 0-18 in short, regular, and long lengths.)
47PsTalnaa	You will most likely have a c-section.  With the placenta near your cervix the baby would apply too much pressure and that would decrease blood flow.  I was taught in school not to even perform a vaginal exam on someone who may have placenta previa.  <br>  <br>  Although I don't work in OB, I'm pretty sure they would want you to have a c-section.  I would give it until the 28th week like you midwife said before you worry too much about it.|`|tZfkPQF6aa	They thought mine would move as well. I'm 28 weeks now and go in next Monday to see if it has moved. At my last ultrasound it was less than 5 centimeters from my cervix, so an inch is much farther than I am.<br>  <br>  My doctor told me that she would not make a definite call on c-section vs natural birth until I am at 36 weeks. The placenta can move at any point, but at 36 weeks they will have to make the call.|`|v3LnJycKaa	to be safe your dr's may want to perform the c-section, there is always a chance it can move up, 1 inch for some dr is in the safe zone for a natural, I know my dr will allow you to attempt natural, with cautions and making sure you are fully informed it could possibly end in a emergency csection, as long as no part of the cervix is covered.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	the lady i work with had placenta previa and most likly you will be having a c-section. i would start planing that way..<br>  <br>  good luck

wURg3jBcaa	I tried to clip them at one week, and I pinched her skin!  (Even with the magnifying glass!)  I haven't touched the clippers since.  I just bite her nails off while she's nursing.  It works great and she hasn't gotten hurt.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi! Immediately, both my babies were born with soft teeny kitten claws!<br>  <br>  I didn't use clippers, though. I found the little clippers often tear the nail, and the big clippers were too big for their fingers. So, for the first few months, I used an emery board.<br>  <br>  With the baby sleeping on my lap, I'd watch a show and gently file their little sharpies away. <br>  <br>  Now that they're older, I use clippers (the large ones), but my husband still uses the good old file method because he's afraid of cutting their fingers.<br>  <br>  We usually trim them once a week or so, it doesn't take much to get those little scratches...<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I never clipped my sons nails, i just file them, it's easier and u don't hafta worry about accidently hurtin them that way.   I filed his nails when he was 3 or 4 days old the first time, and i do it about once a week or so, basically whenever i think they need it.   Some babies nails grow really fast and need it none 2 times a week, others nails grow slower only need it once a week or sometimes even once every 2 weeks, it all depends on the baby.   Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	We did if for the first time when he was a few days old. His nails were getting so long that he would scratch his face. He always figured out how to take the mittens off. We do it now about once a week. Sometimes more depeing on if they need to be cut or not.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I clipped my sons as soon as we got home from the hospital, they were like claws when he was born.<br>  <br>  We usually clip them once a week, otherwise he'll end up with scratches all over his face.|`|AA11540024	I clip my 6 months old about twice a week. They grow fast.|`|Q7jMH5praa	I clip my sons nails every few days or so. His nails grow so fast, I wish mine were like that. I first clipped his nails when he was about a week old, I was so nervous that I would hurt him that i kept putting it off and just put the little baby mittens on him so he wouldn't scratch himself.|`|KDb96QS7aa	I clipped them about once a week. The first time I clipped them was the day I arrived home from the hospital.<br>  <br>  If you're scared about cutting them, have some crazy glue on hand. If you cut them you can just wash the cut quick and a dab of crazy glue will stop the bleeding ASAP|`|kTl39I2gaa	when they get long enough to scratch himself best time to do it is when their sleeping like in the really deep sleep but be careful ive knicked my sons skin 2 times enough to put a bandaid on it be very careful their nails are knda hard to see in clippers|`|AA11903503	I do not clip, I am terrified. I tried it once and couldn't even get the nail.<br>  I bite or file them while he is breastfeeding or sleeping on me. I find the filing the easiest way to go.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	I clip them when they get long enough to scratch herself.  I clipped my daughter's probably the day after she was born.  Her nails were very long at birth.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	My mom clipped my sons nails when we were still in the hospital, he was maybe 3 days old. He's 8 weeks now and I clip his nails about once a week.|`|TJ04fAgNaa	You clip them whenever they get too long.  There's really no time limit to follow, just use your own discretion.|`|lpVgMkgcaa	i was too scared to clip then, i bit them!  I still do actually, and shes 15 months!|`|EhGR05Etaa	I don't do any specific time...I just cut them when they are looking long...usually when I can see white.,...I will trim them.  It's a little different with newborns because they scratch themselves....I would recommend shirts and gowns with gloves...at first at least....gerber long sleeve onsies have hand covers on them...which is great...but you will know...cut them when they are showing white....or when you think they may be too long~

If you need glasses to drive, pick out a nice frame, but don't get all the coating for the lenses to save money, after pregnancy get retested and just change the lenses.|`|wURg3jBcaa	I'd wait till after you deliver.

Furthermore, I picture her being shy yet kind and understated a secrete smartness. <br>  I prefer the nickname spelt the original way of Lily it is far more prettier.

Fkl6gV8Qaa	If you feel guilt and blame yourself every time your child is hurt then you will never be happy. I know it is hard but you have to let it go. Even the best mothers have babies that get hurt and the ones who say that their child has never hurt themselves is either lying or has yet to put the child down which does more harm then good in the long run. I think that your daughter is fine but to make yourself feel better call her pediatrician's office and ask to speak to a nurse. Explain to her what happened and she should be able to give you a satisfactory explanation. As for your husband, if he were mine I would tell him exactly where to put his comments. The fact that you are even on here asking about this shows that you are a loving and caring mother and if he wants to say any differently then he needs a reality check. Has he never been there when the baby has gotten hurt? He is just as much to blame as you are then, which in my eyes there is no blame. Accidents happen plain and simple, and with babies and toddlers they sometimes happen daily.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	well I was always told after a blow to the head it is imperative to NOT allow the baby to fall asleep for at least an hour.  Also, I would have at least phoned the doc when her eyes rolled back.  But I do think she is fine, but if this happens again, don't sit around call your doc. b/c there are some things that you need to look out for that I can't remember right now|`|lpVgMkgcaa	you are not a bad mom!  You should call her doc and explain what happened, she should know how to answer much better then any of us can!|`|1MEnCmwoaa	if it lasted for only 10 seconds then it is probably nothing, but i do understand you being stressed about it!<br>  if you are worried then make a Dr's appt and ask them about it. tell them what she does when she hits her head. <br>  is it possible that when she is crying she is not breathing right and gets light headed? <br>  I say, if you are concerned ask the Dr!|`|2LmfQUbKaa	as a mom i know it is so hard and if her eyes went to the back of her head i think you should take her to get looked at just to be sure that she isnt having seizures or anything! and well as for the hubby it it is real easy for them to judge they dont have the 24/7 job so you keep being a good mom and maybe take her to get checked just to be on the safe side good luck!|`|GCSFnc4Haa	you are right babies fall everday i cant count how many times my son has fallen and bumped his head!! but when there is a head trama you should keep the baby up for atleast 30 mins to make sure there is no concusion<br>  <br>  <br>   picked her up to comfort her & checked the back of her head, but saw no noticeable bump, redness or injury.

They will tell you what to look for and what to expect if you are worried.  If they think it needs to be looked at they will ask you to bring your baby in.  I have the same problem with my son.  He started walking at 9 months and is now 12 months and thinks he can run so he has accidents all the time.  Don't think you are bugging the Doctor with silly questions.  That is their job and what they get paid for.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	My 7 month old fell the other day, he was pulling up on the chair and fell face first on the ceramic tile, he started crying but by the time I picked him up he stopped breathing and passed out, he was limp so I blew in his face and screamed his name and he finally caught his breath. I talked to the doctor about this and he said that some babies hold their breath when they get upset and not to worry that the body knows what to do. My 8 year old used to do the same thing and he's fine now, by about 3-4 years old he grew out of it. Its a really scary thing. You did nothing wrong.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Nature thoughtfully arranged for babies and toddlers to be short -- so when they fall down (as they all do when learning to stand and walk) they don't fall very far.  <br>  <br>  Her brain is well protected inside her skull, and she sounds like she's just fine.

Also I don't know how much older you other kid(s) are (I'm not sure if the total of 4 includes the yet to be born twins) but once you have two toddlers and a not much older child these things are probably going to happen a lot more -just to warn you.<br>  <br>  Usually if they cry immediately its a good sign.  If they were really hurt they normally would pass out right then.<br>  <br>  However if there is ever an INDENT instead of a bump then that is an emergency.  Vomiting is another bad sign, but some babies are prone to vomiting if they cry hard.<br>  <br>  In your case because you think she had changes in consciousness then its not unreasonable to get medical attention.<br>  <br>  Above all else if your gut says something is wrong - LISTEN TO IT!<br>  <br>  PS Even if a child's brain is as fragile as an egg yolk have you ever seen an egg yolk broken before the shell is?  The shell and fluid (egg white for eggs and other fluids for human brains keep them really safe.  The fact that a baby's skull is not solid actually means that it can take a bit more swelling before putting the brain under pressure.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t082300.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t082300...</a><br>  HAT TO DO WHEN YOUR CHILD BUMPS HIS HEAD<br>  <br>      * Don't panic. Stay calm. If your child sees you remain relaxed, he is more likely to calm down.<br>      * Ice, ice, ice! If your child will let you, gently hold an ice pack (a "boo-boo bunny") to the bump (bag of frozen vegetables works great!). This will decrease the eventual size of the bump. Apply the ice for 20 minutes and then take a 5-minute break, then 20 minutes again. Offer your child a treat to eat during the icing to consol him.<br>      * Many children will kick and scream if you try to apply ice. You can decide if it is worth it. The main benefit from ice is cosmetic appearance. Rarely, a large bump will leave a tiny pea-sized residual hard calcium deposit felt under the skin. Applying ice may help prevent this.<br>      * Stop the bleeding. The skin on the face and scalp is extremely rich in blood vessels. Cuts on the face and scalp will bleed much more than other areas of the body. Simply apply gentle pressure to the cut using a cloth (may have ice inside it). The bleeding will stop with time. Children virtually never lose too much blood from a cut or bump, even though it may seem like a lot.<br>      * If there is a cut over the bump, wait for the bleeding to stop, then examine in closely. Click here on Cuts, Scrapes & Stitches to help you decide if it needs stitches.<br>      * Acetaminophen. When your child has calmed down, you may want to give a dose to relieve the headache that might start. Click on Acetaminophen for dosing.<br>      * You need to observe your child's mental status as explained below. Try to keep him awake for at least an hour. After that, you can allow him to take short naps, but no more than 20 minutes without observing him.<br>      * Observe your child. If your child is alert and conscious, walking, talking, playing, and acting like she was before the fall, administer a dose of parental sympathy, apply an ice pack to the cut or bump for twenty minutes, and begin a period of observation before calling your doctor. The reason for the period of observation is because doctors often rely more on how the child behaves after the injury than what happened at the time of the injury. If the brain has been injured, signs may show immediately, or they may appear slowly during the next twenty-four hours. After the period of observation, depending on your baby's condition, you may or may not wish to call the doctor. Besides any when-to-call-the-doctor list there is an overriding inner voice. Trust this monitoring system as much as the most sophisticated electronics. If it tells you something's not quite right, call your doctor to report baby's condition, seek advice, and above all tell the doctor why you are concerned.<br>  <br>  WHEN TO WORRY<br>  <br>  Bumps on the head, even large ones, don't always warrant a trip to the ER or even a call to your doctor. However a hard hit may shake up the brain – called a concussion, also blood can slowly leak out from a damaged blood vessel beneath the skull, called a hematoma that push into the brain tissue. A small hematoma is not dangerous, but larger ones can push into the brain tissue. This can either happen very quickly within an hour, or it can take two or three days. This is an emergency and requires a CAT scan of the head to diagnose. Remember, considering the many times children hit their head, injury to the brain is unusual. Most bumps on the head, even large ones, are not serious. Here are some signs to watch for that warrant a call to the doctor or the ER immediately:<br>  <br>      * Loss of consciousness. If your child blacks out, even for a few seconds, this can mean that the force of the bump was strong enough to cause a hematoma. A reassuring sign is that you either hear or see your child start to cry immediately after the bump. This means he did not lose consciousness. If your child is unconscious, but breathing and pink (no blue lips), lay her on a flat surface and call emergency medical services. If you have cause to suspect a neck injury, don't move the child but let the trained experts in neck injuries transport her. If she is not breathing, apply CPR, or if she's having a convulsion, keep her airway clear. Sometimes, if baby is sensitive and prone to temper tantrums, she may be pushed into a breath-holding spell, which could be mistaken for a convulsion. This scene naturally pushes panic buttons and gets baby rushed to the hospital. Even if this turns out to be unnecessary, it is better to be safe. When in doubt, take baby and sit in the waiting room of the local hospital emergency room.<br>      * Vomiting. Many children will vomit once or twice after a big bump on the head, either from crying, coughing and gagging, or just from the shock to the skull. This is expected. However, if your child vomits three or more times, he should be looked at in the ER. As a precaution feed the recovering faller clear liquids for a few hours. Breastfeeding is therapeutic.<br>      * Altered mental status. This means that your child won't focus on you, look you in the eyes, or respond to questions or commands. Fighting you when you try to apply ice are actually goods signs that he is okay.<br>      * Loss of balance while walking. Many children may complain of dizziness. This is expected. But if your child actually loses is balance and repeatedly falls over while walking, he needs to see a doctor. Watch your child's normal play. Is he doing everything the same after the fall: sitting straight, walking well, moving arms and legs normally? Or is he off balance, wobbly, dragging a leg, or becoming increasingly disoriented? In the pre- walker, do you notice any change in sitting or crawling skills or in manipulative hand skills<br>      * Prolonged crying. If an infant continues to cry inconsolably for more than an hour after a good dose of acetaminophen, he should probably see a doctor.<br>      * Severe headache. If a child continues to complain of a very severe headache you should consult a doctor immediately.<br>      * Eye signs. The eyes mirror what's going on inside the body, especially inside the brain. In fact, the back of the eye is so intimately connected with the brain that your doctor looks at the backs of the eyes for evidence of brain swelling while examining a child following a head injury. A child's signs are more difficult to assess, but here are the call-doctor cues:<br>            o Crossed eyes or rolling eyes<br>            o One pupil larger than the other<br>            o Behavior such as tripping or running into things that indicates baby's vision is diminished<br>            o In the older child, add complaints of seeing double and blurred vision to the worry list <br>      * When in doubt always seek medical attention.<br>  <br>  WHAT TO LOOK FOR OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS<br>  <br>  Check your child frequently for any of the above signs. Also check for:<br>  <br>  Changes in baby's sleep behavior. Babies normally retreat into sleep after trauma, which makes the usual admonition to "watch for a change in consciousness" an anxiety-producing instruction for the parent. If a head injury occurs near night or nap time in an already tired child, you may be confused about whether the drowsiness is due to the injury or whether it's just time for sleep to naturally overtake the child. And it may be impossible to follow the advice "Don't let baby go to sleep." Let baby fall asleep, but awaken yourself every two hours and do a baby check. This is what to look for:<br>  <br>      * Change in color. From pink to pale or, even more alarming, blue.<br>      * Change in breathing. Periods of very shallow breathing, ten-to twenty-second periods of stop-breathing episodes followed by irregular breathing, or gasping episodes (remember that newborns normally have irregular breathing).<br>      * Twitches. On one side of the body involving a whole limb.<br>  <br>  If baby's color and breathing patterns are normal (no change from usual) and your parental instincts sense nothing's wrong, there's no need to awaken baby unless advised to do so by you doctor. The deep sleep from a head injury is nearly always associated with shallow, irregular breathing patterns that you are unlikely to have seen before.<br>  <br>  If, however, you are uncertain or child's appearance sets off a "not normal" alarm, do a partial arousal. Sit or stand your child up and then put her back down. Normally, a child will fuss a bit and thrash around in the bed to resettle. If your child does not act like this, try to fully arouse her by sitting or standing her up, opening her eyes, and calling her name. If she awakens, looks at you, fusses or smiles, and struggles to be left undisturbed, you can go back to sleep without worrying. If, on the other hand, she does not protest, c
AA11109728	My daughter used to find and carry around 'fuzzies'.  She'd find a fuzzy on something, and hold it in the crook of one of her fingers all day long!  She was so good at it, she could do anything while holding a fuzzy!  You'd never even know it was there.  She did it for the longest time as a toddler, but she's 4 now and that phase has apparently passed.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	My daughter won't sleep unless she has something to hold beside her face.  I think it's from being breastfed when she was younger.  She has to have a blanket or something to hold next to her face or she stays up crying all night.  And she's not even attached to a certain blanky or anything, it could be anything from a blanket to a towel as long as its soft and beside her face.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	My son is 5, and HAS to fall asleep with his bedroom light on. And, when I'm going to bed, it HAS to be off !! (he doesn't like the dark)|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Right before my 4 week old goes to sleep, he will have a huge grin on his face, just smiling away.... then he's out cold. It's too cute!|`|ThnKiLfTaa	When my oldest son (who is 13yrs old now) was an infant up until he was a about 2-3yrs old. When going to sleep he would put his hand up my sleeve and rub my arm. I spoiled him to sleeping in the bed with me  (yea yea it was my fault lol) so I would lie down in bed with him to get him to sleep at nap time and bed time and he would stick his hand up my sleeve and just rub my arm until he dozed off. And I had to wait until he was sound asleep before I could move his hand or otherwise he would know lol. And if he woke up in the middle of the night he would stick his hand right back up there. Even his daycare teacher and my Mom both said said he did the same thing to them when when they  would be getting him to sleep.  For some reason it was comforting and soothing to him. So sweet.|`|YvqqoUr1aa	My son is 2 and a half.  Until recently, he refused to wear any kind of hat.  He didn't even want the hood up on his jacket in the cold.  About 3 months ago, my husband bought him this really cute superman baseball cap.  Now, Alex can't go anywhere without wearing his "super hat."  It's the cutest thing!  He even wears it to bed at night.|`|f0dnVAW7aa	Heehee - what a silly little boy Jamie sounds to be.<br>  <br>  I have two daughters. My oldest will be two mid April and my second will be three weeks this Wednesday.<br>  <br>  My oldest daughter, Sydney, refused to learn to walk until she was around 13 months old. She wouldn't even try. When myself or my husband picked her up from the sitting position her legs never moved. She just stayed sitting in the air, when we laid her on her back she kept her legs in the air until we lowered them. When we put her back on her play mat, she kicked her legs right again. It was so sweet and I never thought it would end. I have a few pictures - but it just makes you realize how quickly they grow up.<br>  <br>  Another thing is when my daughter lays with me. She has to touch my lips. She grabs my mouth and says 'yips Mommy, yips'.. I can't help but smile.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	My son calls tissue tennis shoe - he's 6<br>  <br>  He asked me when we got color in the world because he seen that all the old shows were black and white and just assumed the whole world was in black and white.|`|01vMpHkWaa	JEALOUS JEALOUS JEALOUS!!!!!!
tQVBDx5Paa	In KY:<br>  Take classes every Saturday for 5 weeks<br>  Have two home visits<br>  Background check<br>  <br>  It was a long process.....we did it before we got pregnant with Emma.|`|Rz4oG2HXaa	Start by calling your local Dept of Children and Family, or whatever it is called in your area. They will be able to answer many of your questions. You will be required to attend the training classes(Pride or MAPPs), including first aid and CPR classes, complete an application packet which includes a personal history on both you and hubby, financial information/budget, medical evaluation/physical, complete what is called a home study--this is when the Social Worker comes to your house to meet with you and your family & look through your home for safety issues. You will need to provide fingerprints for a criminal/child abuse background check. You will need to provide personal references to be checked out, verification of employment. If you have children in school they may contact the school to see what kind of parent you are. If you have pets they will need to look at their shot records to make sure they are up to date. <br>  <br>  While you are looking into becoming a foster parent, please do some research on the positive and negative side of fostering. While the positive may outweigh the negative at times, the negative can be devastating to your family.|`|H0fXySX9aa	to be a foster parent you need to be checked out by social services<br>  they do an enhanced CRB check on you with the criminal records bureau<br>  you als have your home checked out whether you have any pets what needs you might have disabilities work commitments other children<br>  they want to know about your health they go to your doc after you have signed a form<br>  you also go on a fostering course as well|`|AA11537580	it depends on where you live<br>  it takes about a year, they investigate you and your husband, do a home visit, you have to do some courses|`|8iaCr4Vxaa	What state are you in?  The requirements are different for each state.  Google foster parenting with your state in it.  that should give you enough information to access the correct department of children and family services in your area.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	You can google up your state or county's name + foster parents and find information that way.<br>  <br>  My mother was a foster parent for many years until she just adopted all the kids she had. She had to apply to be a foster parent, take classes, and have a social worker come into their house and check things out. After all that, she started receiving kids. Good luck!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	First off you need to have no felony's.And permission from the state/family's.There is a lot more to it as well.Maybe an agency can tell you your qualifications depending on the state.
ZlNFOgO7aa	After my first babby I was already planning the second the next day after delivery, lol. I had a miscarriage before I had my daughter, then a miscarriage before my son. After I had my son I said maybe one more. The it turned to NO MORE, then oopsie, pregnant. Now no matter what I can't have anymore, I have an IUD and Hubby has had a vasectomy. I had a crap labour without any drugs, the last time and it completely put me off. Plus we would need to find a money tree to support another babby.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My husband and I both said no more after our son was born. But, we went to go visit friends who just had a little girl and I got baby fever. My husband still doesn't want any more kids, but I think I may want one in the next few years.|`|JK2RvliYaa	If your talking about gittin drunk till I vomit, only like every friday! lol|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	we said no more after the 3rd! now im having baby 6!! <br>  this is defo the last...................|`|2fB383F2aa	When my daughter was first born and did nothing but cry the first 5 months (colic) I said I never wanted another baby! She's 2 now, and now that she's walking, talking and has more personality, I've found myself thinking I really want another baby!<br>  <br>  It also doesn't help being around friends who have a second baby.. Just holding a newborn really gets to me!|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Nope, I had two high risk pregnancies, had to go in to the doc every two weeks (I have incompetent cervix) and it was not the easiest thing in the world, but I never said never again.  I did however get my tubes tied after the second c-section, but we had discussed it prior to delivery and it seemed like the smartest choice for us.  I do have moments in which I think how much fun it would be to have another baby, but then that feeling quickly fades as I realize my plate is FULL with my 8 and 10 year old, and my stepson living in the house too! LOL|`|AA12145826	Oh please! I caused a L&D nurse to choke on her cough drop when I said "so next time...."! LoL.<br>  <br>  My husband is the "we'll see" one, not me.....She's going to be 7 this year, really I would like to have another one (or however many the good Lord grants me in this next pregnancy....I'll do 1 more pregnancy....I think) soon.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	My son will be 4 weeks old tomorrow and from the day I found out I was pregnant I was miserable.  Felt horrible!  Labor was horrible... so I'm still in the NEVER WILL I EVER DO THAT AGAIN state of mind.  I really don't see myself having anymore babies, I love my son to death but I don't want to go through the misery again, lol.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Yup I'm one of those! Lol After I had my son when I was 16 I said never again, cause of how much pain you go through. My pregnancy was great but labor was too painful. All worth it though, now I'm expecting again!<br>  <br>  Mom to 1 Boy And Expecting My Little Girl!|`|DvnOIx1laa	I said never again after the first one, now I have the second one, and my husband is already talking about one more! I told him he better buy me a home way away from his parents before we even think about it!!!|`|EMKuBql8aa	It happens to all parents, lol. You just miss that cuddly feeling when they are so young, it is natural and normal.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	yes, I know that feeling. I said never again. and now I'm hoping to get pregnant this year|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Before my husband and I married, we both wanted 4 kids. (Both of us come from a family of 6.) After our first two, who are 16 and half months apart, we were going to wait a few years, and then have two more... Let the first two grow up a bit, give them good attention, etc... However, after our 2nd was born, I said, "Yay, I never have to be pregnant, again!"<br>  <br>  A few years passed, and we decided we were done... Then, as my youngest approached age 6, I began to have 'the thoughts'! My third was born when my youngest was 7, and my oldest was barely 9... 11 months later, I was pregnant with our last, and our family is complete! Personally, I'm glad I listened to that nagging feeling, or I wouldn't have my two little darlings! Pregnancy was always difficult for me: I'm 5'2", 100 lbs., non-pregnant, and have biggish babies! (For my size, anyway.) But, it's definitely worth it. :)|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I said never again too. Eventually you forget about the pain and just want another one. Every labor and delivery is different this may not happen the next time. Just follow your heart and do what is right for you.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	I said no after first child, i now have two and hopefully be a third on way this year!!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	IM still at never again.. ;)|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Oh, yeah I know that feeling. I have a nine month old and I always thought I would only have one child if any. But almost as soon as I saw him I thought wow, I could do this again! Is there any way to have the pregnancy and labor part but then just sort of cuddle the new baby for a while and go back to it never happening? Like in a dream reality or something where the actual responsibilities of another child don't come into play? Lol.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	My wife had said never again, Then after many years she suddenly pops out with I want another one.
1MEnCmwoaa	I got pregnant round 3, it worked the way it was supposed to the first 2 times it just took 3 months.<br>  50 mg<br>  CD 3-7<br>  I took it in the morning, and had horrible hot flashes from it anytime of day!
S6QpB8QZaa	I was on round 4 and my dosage was at 100mg. I took mine from cycle days 5-9 and it was always taken around noon cause it was much easier to remember to take it with lunch than to take it with breakfast cause I had a 2 year old running in circles. I guess That answers all your questions. I am now 14 weeks pregnant with a healthy little miracle baby. Good luck and baby dust to those who are trying.|`|bBWHrEciaa	We used clomid twice. First time with my daughter we got pregnant the first month on 50mg. I took the pills first thing in the morning for the 5 days prescribed. We had a healthy, gorgeous baby girl. We were ready for another baby and used clomid again. 50 mg again and got pregnant the first month again, but with twins. I lost the twins during my 11th week. We're trying again...but avoiding clomid this time if at all possible! Good luck!|`|fMilDRgLaa	It was my third round. I started at 100mg the first month...didn't ovulate.  OBGYN bumped me to 150 mg. the second month...ovulated/no baby. Third month was 150 mg. and was a charm...now my son is 4 1/2 years old!  I took it days 3-7 I think.  I took it at night if I remember correctly.<br>  <br>  And I finally stopped counting and taking temps.  We had sex every other day for nearly 2 weeks straight.  ;)   Take Care!
2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	if that was my brother i would be yelling at  him and making sure he knows how big of a loser he is.. and how he is putting a burden on "our" mother.. i would tell him to get out and get a life.. and of course he will say this isn't your house.. but really just tell him to grow up and stop being a mooch... god that makes me so mad when people are like that. <br>  its really up to your mom to kick him out. he is a grown man and shouldn't be relying on her for anything. <br>  im 27 and haven't lived with my parents sense i was 19.. so i cant stand people who are freeloaders..<br>  <br>  good luck
rC6gL7KOaa	I think it's very thoughful of you. Every expecting mom deserves a baby shower. If I were you, I would ask her if she would mind first though. You never know, she might not be having a shower b/c she doesn't want one. But if she says it's ok, I would definitely go for it. It says a lot about you and your character.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, I didn't know you wanted it to be a surprise. Well in that case, ask her boyfriend if anybody had planned on throwing her a shower and if he thinks she would mind.|`|dbafItLvaa	All my good friends and family live out of state, and I was so glad that someone I know is going to throw me a shower!  I think it's a great idea and will probably bring the two of you closer.  Good luck!|`|H2ciLJoPaa	Every new mom deserves a baby shower! If you have the time and money then definetly do it. Put yourself in her position....I'm sure she'll REALLY appreciate it especially since no one else is having her one.|`|sgMno1PRaa	Speak to her boyfriend and let him help organise it with you - least that way you will have someone helping you who is a bit closer to home kinda thing|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	Wow thats such a great news and what are you waiting for<br>  Every expecting wife would love to have one<br>  Even what we did for one we organized that we asked her to make her a bucket of wish list and we gave her all those things which she had listed as a surprise.<br>  <br>  Just go ahead...|`|e0Om6Onqaa	I think it's a good idea and very thoughtful. Everyone deserves a good baby shower. It's sad no one has started planning one for her yet.|`|GfG6wupTaa	I think she would love a shower.|`|F3BRG72iaa	i think its a good idea and it would definitely make her feel good..go for it and good luck|`|QSodlfMraa	i thinks that is so sweet of you let her boyfriend help you too.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	u are nice<br>  get a list<br>  do a no host lunch <br>  just keep it simple and fun
pT7jrsAgaa	I've always thought it best that when they start asking questions, give them an honest answer....age appropriate, of course.  My son is 12 and we've been really talking about the details for about a year now. The questions that boy comes up with! LOL  The main thing I want him to understand is how important it is to be able to handle a physical relationship emotionally, not just because your body wants to or because everyone else is doing it.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	If you planning on having ''the talk'' don't do it as one big awkward, embarrassing conversation. Try starting young, with the basics. A few talks by the time their 13 (On puberty) and in your child's language ... don't do the unnecessary detail of gruesome facts, which a yong child can't contemplate, just simple, truthful & factual info, let them ask the questions, and you answer. <br>  <br>  I would say about 8 is a good age. Start with puberty first, then why puberty occurs ie where babies come from, and leave the safe sex talk for the older child 13-14.|`|HKKu4CjEaa	THESE DAYS!!, you better give it at twelve!  I might not hurt to, anyway.  But, they'll learn a lot from friends, radio, T.V., and the internet nowadays.  Hellll, I never gave my 18 year old stepson "the talk."  His dad whom he never sees but once every month or so might have tried to give it to him.  That's only a 10% chance though.|`|f0dnVAW7aa	I always thought that it was a good idea to just tell them things from the start (not like disgusting details) - but that would just make it not so strange for 'the talk'.<br>  <br>  I would say age 10 - after then who knows where kids will find out this stuff.|`|CyDVisE7aa	Right now tell him to punch his girlfriend in the ovary so she doesnt have kids|`|6Nuaqihpaa	Anywhere from 12 to 16.|`|e8bRcVNAaa	55 or 52.|`|MA9XuLlHaa	5|`|AqDEQUqLaa	Okay well personaly im onyl 15 so you make not take me seriously but...I really don't think there is a need for "The big talk" about the "birds and the bees". In our society nowadays the kids are all on Pornogrophy sites and there curious so they look through there health textbooks and look on sites they souldnt be on. Undoubtedly by the time your son is 13 he will know more about it than you, no offence meant or anything!|`|EzkGVZ1Yaa	I think teaching children about sex requires a gentle, non-stop flow of information that should begin as early as possible.  For instance, while teaching your toddler where his nose and toes are, you should include "this is your penis" or "this is your vagina" in your talks. As your child grows, you can continue his/her education by adding more information gradually until they understand the subject well.<br>  <br>  While our children need to know the biological facts about sex, they also need to understand that sexual relationships involve caring, concern and responsibility. By discussing the emotional aspect of a sexual relationship with your child, she will be better informed to make decisions later on and to resist peer pressure. If your child is a pre-teen, you need to include some message about the responsibilities and consequences of sexual activity. Conversations with 13 or 14 years old, should include talks about unwanted pregnancy and how they can protect themselves.|`|0OZSkiYQaa	around 15 years old....|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I would say about 12years old. The way kids these are these days and being so fresh for their age i would rather have the talk sooner then to late.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	The age is pretty broad, but if you notice any changes in his behavior, I would say it is time.  Besides, parents usually know the right time when it comes.  If this is specific to you, good luck!|`|B1iBGRzUaa	They need to know the difference between a good touch and a bad touch as early as 4 or 5. They need to know where babies come from (general) by the time they get to middle school. I would not talk of condoms or details until 13 or 14. I would tell them they need to wait until they are in a commited relationship and must use a condom. They need to know sex without a condom is not an option.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	I would say between 10 and 13.  Especially if/when he asks about changes to his body/morning dreams/etc.  I don't have a son, so I really don't have anything to go off of other than what I would probably do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little bit.|`|6PhSENcXaa	I have 5 sons and it was 14 years old when they got the talk.  It was like that for me and my 10 brothers.  At 14 years old dad would say come on it's time I have a talk with you now.|`|um29wkUPaa	I would say between 10-13 for a boy depending on the level of maturity, level of interest, volume of questions and changes he's experiencing with his own body.
AA11109728	I have a 4 yr. old also, we always say she tooted.  I don't think them saying 'farted' sounds nice either, so we use tooted instead.  It's funny, I know as I kid I probably said farted a lot (I had a few brothers!), but it sounds different when it's coming from your cute, innocent, little child's mouth!  LOL|`|x8JRkRNkaa	My three year old daughter is the gassiest little girl I've ever met. I think she gets it from her daddy....we call it tooting. :)|`|gCCkDLMHaa	i would just call it what your  calling it. its something that you can tell her when she gets older you know. All the things she said wrong. That could be one of yalls memories .
WO6anwpLaa	Everything should be fine... when i first moved into my townhouse we found out the place was infested with fleas... so they had to come in and spray and i was still in my first or very beginning of my second trimester and i did research and asked the people spraying if it was OK for me to be in the house... they said that as long as i was out of the house for the whole recommended time it was perfectly safe and that if i preferred to stay out longer it wouldn't hurt... but i even asked my doc and she said it was fine! :) so don't worry!!!|`|TTKJHK7qaa	You will live that stuff hardly stays in the house 24 hours with smell much less strong enough to hurt you.... secondly...isnt like you stayed in the room as it fogged the house so you will be fine stop stressing thats worse for the baby|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	yes I think everything will be fine. It reminds me of myself though. once when I was pregnant my neighbors allowed their little daughter to visit us and swim in our pool when she had head lice. I had a fit because you have to use that special chemical shampoo to get rid of lice. well my baby came out fine and yours will too. I know you have worries now but everything will be ok you will see. <br>  and when your pregnant it seems like the whole world goes on with out you, that will go away too when you have your baby. still there will be feelings like that after the baby comes but soon everything will be back to normal. have fun being a new mom and enjoy your slow time things will speed up soon enough.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	You need to ask her what the chemical she used. Then you need to call Poison Control and tell them you are pregnant and if this chemical is something that should be worried about. Some Poison Control won't answer this question and will tell you to call your OB and have them call the Poison Control to check the side effects.<br>  <br>  I know this from experience. I was super paranoid about my last pregnancy as with my current. When the spray company came to my house and sprayed the outside, then proceeded to tell me that I am safe and not to lick the outside brick, I just about flipped a lid. It's funny when it's somebody else but, when it's your baby that is at stake it's not a laughing matter.<br>  <br>  Call her, ask for the ACTIVE INGREDIENT. It should be in the bottle. If not, just ask her what the name of the chemical was, if you want then call a vet office to ask for the active ingredient, then call your OB and leave a message explaining this. When she/he calls you back your mind will be at ease.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  I just want to say that as silver lining, you were inyour 2nd trimester usually the risk is lower because the first trimester is when all the organs are being formed. Relax :)|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	I think you will be ok.  Just to reassure yourself ask the dr.  On a side note, your mother sounds rather selfish and uncaring.  Take care of yourself and don't let your mother and her flea bitten dog get you down.|`|xpstigPTaa	I think you and baby will be just fine hun. Try not to stress about it. I cannot blame you for being upset with her about it though. I would be really upset as well. Is she happy about this pregnancy? Please don't stress about it becuase the baby will feel all your stress. I wish you the best of luck and I know you will be just fine.
jLLkSWyiaa	if you completely want to stop taking it .. you can stop at anytime .. im not sure what you are asking though...  sorry|`|b8VpYSJOaa	When I wanted to get pregnant I stopped the day I started my period. That way it wouldn't be messed up and I would know about when it should come again.|`|mbP4pEJqaa	Read the packet, it varies.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	You can stop anytime you want.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	I don't understand your question....if you want to prevent pregnancy you don't stop it....ever
jG8b3Mz0aa	Don't worry about what others think. As long as your child is being FED that's all that should matter.<br>  <br>  ETA- I have to second what BoSox said. I've been bashed for breastfeeding my son. I get people constantly asking me why this, and why that? You know my response -> Does it really matter, as long as my baby is getting fed why do you care? Do your best momma and stop taking others critism to heart.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	You don't have to justify your decision. Breast feeding and formula feeding are equally good decisions for various reasons. You are the only person who has the right to determine how your child eats. I formula feed too. Your experience with breast feeding is exactly like mine. Well for those righteous breast feeders that think you are feeding your son poison- various studies have proven the existence of pesticides in breast milk through mother's exposure to everyday pesticides. I guess that is not the "purest" or most "natural" source of nutrition. I am not trying to undermine the benefits of breast milk, just pointing out flaws in breast feeding nazi's logic (like they have one concerning YOUR baby.) <br>  <br>  Try to laugh if anyone comments again. It helped me to put it in perspective.|`|14JQ11AUaa	I formula feed too!!!! I did breastfeed for the first 4 months..<br>  I KNOW formula is as good as breast milk...but it is not better! Ignore them, we all do what we feel in our hearts are best for our children and no two people will EVER be the same :)|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You are doing what is best for your son.  Would they have preferred he starved?  Some people out there are just cruel.  Try to ignore their comments and realize that it is your choice how you feed your child.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Yo dont owe us or anyone else an explanation as to why you bottle feed instead of nursing. You made the choice you made because it was th best decision for YOUR family.  Your still feeding your baby and your feeding him nutritious food, not poison. This dosnt reflect on you as a parent and it dosnt matter if he couldnt latch or if you simply dont want to, you made your choice, its a healthy choice, your still bonding, your son knows he's loved when you look him in the eye and smile. Bonding dosnt stem from whether the nipple is rubber or skin, it stems from being close.<br>  Next time someone makes a thoughtless comment, tell  her to pay attention to her baby and not yours/|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	Tell them that if they feel the need to judge what you are feeding your child that you will be forced to judge everything that goes into their mouth as well...afterall fair is fair. That's how I handled that and I guarantee you that it shut quite a few people up. You don't owe them any kind of explanation and they quite frankly are being jerks for saying anything about it in the 1st place. <br>  As far as why people bash you for it...well there is this minority of breastfeeding women who seem to think that they are morally superior to people who bottle feed. They never take into account that there are reasons why people bottle feed...and it's not that they are bad parents who are trying to "poison" their kids.<br>  Try not to let it upset you. Your son is going to be fine being bottlefed. Both my kids were and quite frankly are ALOT healthier than the kids I know that were breastfed.|`|wG9vlIoJaa	Because people will always find something to bash others about. Whether it's formula feeding, disposable nappying, circumcizing, not "wearing" your babies, holding them, not holding them, give them puree, give them spicy food, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  On a positive note, you're not being bashed now.<br>  I'm sure you're a wonderful mom who wants nothing but the best for your baby.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I feel your pain!  I have to feed my son breast milk from a bottle and everybody automatically assumes that he's getting formula. I get horrible looks and rude comments... but I just ignore it.  People will make ignorant comments no matter what you do.  Just know within yourself that you're doing what you NEED to do for your son.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Exactly don't worry about what others think.The important thing is that you are parenting your son.Some have there own opinions which is fine but they they do not need to throw it in others faces.Some have trouble brest feeding or just cant.|`|0QYIbn1saa	Because people are rude and ignorant and have too much time on their hands.  I breastfed and I never ever EVER judged people for formula feeding. If you're feeding your child, YAY!  That's all that is important.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	WHO CARES WHAT THEY THINK?!?!?!<br>  <br>  HE IS YOUR SON, YOU ARE THE MOM.<br>  <br>  Be proud! They do not care about you, dont care about them.<br>  Words are words.<br>  Live your life and enjoy your baby =] =]|`|jLYTKr33aa	I was bashed by some for breast feeding my son.  There are negative people on both sides - don't let them bother you.|`|JpE5ELbqaa	*Hugs* You probably feel bad about the ugly comments because you feel guilty in some way for not being able to breastfeed.  Been there.  I felt guilty, too, even though I couldn't control what happened to me.  Just let the comments go in one ear and out the other.  I know it's hard but you need to rest assured that you are caring for and loving your baby.  People really need to mind their own business.|`|FeMJDEcIaa	Dont worry about what other people say to you... No one can really give you advice until they have walked in your shoes.  <br>  Your doing what you need for your son, your doing what is best.<br>  <br>  I think your doing great, people get so wrapped up in controversy that they dont look at the most important part, your taking great care of your son.<br>  <br>  Keep doing what you do girl, he is your son and you are a great mom.|`|7ee2e58a43d3c7214fd3e8cb1f2c131eaa	Don't worry so much about what other people think.YOU are the mom.YOU make the choices & YOUR opinion is the only one that matters.You KNOW that you aren't poisoning your son & that should be good enough for ya.Be confident in your choice.|`|mjd1qjy7aa	It's people ignorance and insensitivity. my daughter is both breastfed and bottlefed. She is only 12 days old. The most important thing is ensuring that the baby is eating well no matter what the source is.|`|EvMvSHULaa	People were the same with me.....I couldn't because my milk never came in, and I'm not sure that I would have if it had.  It's a personal choice, my children are all fine healthy lil boys.  Ignore them, it's your child.|`|dwt1sidtaa	Hold your head up and be proud of how you are taking care of your new baby boy!  You don't have to explain yourself to anybody!<br>  Congrats!|`|OIS808Qmaa	Don't worry, as long as your son is being fed.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	Because people are rude and judgmental; you need to learn to ignore them and know that you are doing what is best for you and your son, it's nobody elses business what you do. Oh and expect to get bashed on here, people are beyond rude. You sound like a great mom btw! =]|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I think that the issue is that people just don't understand. While I nurse my daughter I need to supplement with formula while she's at daycare (I just can't get enough pumped for an entire day) and I know MANY people that solely formula fed their babies and a few who like you tried to breast feed but because of factors beyond their control couldn't. Only people that have kids and have been in such situations could possibly understand and people who don't have kids will never understand. Forget about what other people think. You know you're doing the best you possibly can for your son. after all, what would people rather you do, starve him?
zwJbUbWMaa	Well did you wash everything he had with the same detergent or did you go buy something baby safe?  Don't put him in any more of his clothes or blankets or hold him against yours until you get everything washed with something like Dreft.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	This is normal.  The corticosteroid has worn off.  Call your doctor and tell them the rash re-appeared.  They will give you either atarax (longer acting antihistamine like benadryl) or give you a benadryl dosage.  They may also tell you to use a topical corticosteroid like cortisone 10 extra strength that is 1 percent hydrocortisone otc or call you in a stronger prescription of topical steroid like hydrocortisone 2.5 percent, hydrocortisone aclovate, or hydrocortisone valerate.  I would ask for atarax and ask for a topical steroid.  He will need to be on this for a few days most likely.  <br>  <br>  Either he was re-exposed, or the meds wore off.  If it is from meds wearing off, my experience is 3 days to 5 days round the clock with the topical steroids and atarax.  A re-exposure you may need to just remove the irritant, and then give meds 1 time and that will do it.<br>  <br>  The reaction may not be from the detergent.  It could be from the body wash.  We use aveeno.  Anything with lanolin in it should be avoided.  Lanolin is a wool derivative and is a known irritant.  Also avoid anything with alcohol in it, because its drying.  Johnson and Johnson's has alcohol in it.<br>  <br>  Also the reaction could be from the lotion used.  We use cetaphil cream in the tub not the pump.  Eucerin and Aquaphor my son broke out from because of the lanolin.<br>  <br>  We use All clear detergent.<br>  <br>  If it persists suggest calling a pediatric allergist, they normally aren't excited about seeing a child under two, however my son was dx with allergies before 1 from the allergist.<br>  <br>  If skin issues persist suggest seeing a pediatric dermatologist.<br>  <br>  I have experience with both of these specialists for my son<br>  <br>  did he recently receive 4month vaccines?  If he did, then it could be he is developing an autoimmunity, and you should consider spacing them out from now on, being selective, or getting 1 at a time.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Did you change the detergent like you were supposed to? What is the detergent? Free in clear will not cause that.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Have you introduced any new foods? Milk? Cereal? <br>  <br>  Toss all the soap, baby lotion, baby powder & laundry detergent.  (put them away and introduce 1 at a time).<br>  <br>  Wash all of his clothes and bedding. Yours too. <br>  <br>  Did he get any new toys? Any new plants in your home? <br>  <br>  If the rash continues take him back to the ER.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Detergent rashes don't usually cause that violent of a reaction. What is he eating? Is he on formula? Animals in the house? Eliminate everything one at a time. Food allergies can be the culprit too.|`|VDdEMPsdaa	I changed my baby's milk formula to a Organic one, Hipp and the rashes disapeared.|`|OpVysSzQaa	change the detergent you use. go to something less toxic, less additives, and if possible, find one that is intended for use on infant's clothes. also remember to use baby-friendly dryer sheets and fabric softeners.|`|dnvk4UPTaa	normal. my moms friends have babies and they always say that they get rashes. but when the doctor said he was allergic to his detergent did you wash all of his clothes in the same detergent? if so that's why your baby still has the rash. try using a new detergent with no sent or perfume|`|nZVGUzZzaa	dreft baby detergant is the best that you can use for the baby its specially formulated for the sensitivity of a babies skin, it will be ok just make sure that you wash everything that his skin would come in touch with.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	maybe it is if you have one an animal the fabrick the soap you bath him in the lotion sit down and go over everything he is in contact with that you may have used this morning and stop using one by one but i would take him to a baby specialist!|`|C0uMGfCCaa	it is but make sure becaus e he seems kin of young also switch detergent.|`|lpVgMkgcaa	change the detergent you are using.  they have the free and clear kind, with no chemicals!
ezMoS0mqaa	if you mean the one where you have dye put through your tubes under anaesthetic then here's one for ya- i conceived about a week after mine and had been ttc for 13 months prior haha. They also said to me there was no apparent blockage.|`|vue9NOhYaa	The HSG isn't a treatment, it's a test.  <br>  <br>  After my HSG, it took another 18 months or so, and about 8 cycles of fertility drugs before I got pregnant.|`|AA11084769	I actually got pregnant about a month after the HSG. The main thing is to just relax and not worry and stress over it too much (easier said than done, I know!) Everything will happen when it is time to happen! Good luck!
b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	3 months sounds too young and if she's refusing it would suggest that she's not ready.<br>  <br>  The recommended age to begin introducing solids is between 4-6 months and your child will let you know when they're ready. At a young age the baby's natural reaction when objects larger than milk enter their mouth is to spit it out. When they're ready for solids the baby's reflex in the tongue changes and allows the baby to swallow albeit pureed foods.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	you could try mixing in a little baby applesauce or other fruit with it.  just a tiny bit to start, though.  my daughter ended up absolutely loving rice cereal w/mashed banana.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Who told you to do this?  There are NO reliable sources that would recommend giving solid food to such a young baby. She's too young to eat from a spoon, and you NEVER put solid food in a bottle. <br>  <br>  If your baby is truly hungry, she needs formula -- not rice starch that she can't digest.  <br>  <br>  If she's sleeping a longer stretch at night, it looks like she's taking around 36-40 ounces of formula a day?  That isn't too much, and is no reason to try and 'fill her up' with cereal. Most up-to-date sources say that a baby can have up to 45-50 ounces of formula per day.  <br>  <br>  Keep offering formula as she wants/needs it and, in another 2-3 months, you can start thinking about solids.  (Which needn't be rice cereal if she dosen't like it.)|`|jXtbb11Haa	3 months is very young to have anything other than milk which is probably why she hates it so much. <br>  <br>  I do simpathise with you though. My little girl who is now 5 months is breast fed and has fed every 2 hours (sometimes every hour) since she was about 4 weeks old - its tiring, but i waited for as long as possible before giving her any food to give her the best possible start.<br>  <br>  I put pureed fruit with my babies rice cereal to give it flavour and she loves it, but if you try this check with a doctor first to make sure its ok with a baby that young.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Wait a few days or weeks and try again. <br>  <br>  Babies this young often have a gag reflex and will gag and thrust their tongue out to get rid of the cereal. It is not that they don't like the taste. It is more the texture that is not right for them. It is a 'built in' safety feature to let you know they are not physically ready for solids.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, if she is that hungry, give her another ounce of formula.<br>  <br>  Note: Most babies will continue to gag until about 5-6 months|`|x10qO89saa	my daughter hates it too, i mixed it into her bottle with her formula. my pedi told me one teaspoon per ounce. but it seems to be too thick. so... i make 4 ounce bottles for her, and i put in 3 teaspoons of cereal. also make sure to use fast flow nipples otherwise it wont get threw. also, heat up the bottle first then add cereal after. best of luck!
WPI0Z47saa	It stinks but there is no way on telling how much longer. You could be rushing back in an hour to deliever or it could be another day or so. That same situation happened to a coworker of mine and she actually came back to work to get her mind off of things and didn't deliever until 5 days later. I hope you go soon but you have to try to relax and let nature take its course. You are almost there. Good luck.|`|C6oTOvOMaa	I have been keeping track of your progression since u are in my contacts list and I must say that I am getting frustrated for you! I think that is ridiculous to send u home at 4 cms dilated. some docs and nurses do what is convenient for them and do not look at the well being of the mother. u are full term and there is no reason that they couldnt have had u admitted...The only thing i can tell is stay on your feet as much as possible, whether it be cleaning the house, walking MORE, watching tv on your feet, walking up stairs etc..If your baby is face up and not head down yet dont try to do squats as this will put baby deeper into your pelvic bone which then he would not be able to turn head down which would possibly require a c section..If u feel comfortable enough have lots of sex and allow the semen to "pool" at your cervix for at least an hour, it will definitely help riped and dilate u even more..Good luck this time!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i was like that on the monday evening finally gave birth wednesday night<br>  i refused to sit down all day on the tuesday so i walked went shopping did loads of house work anything expect sit down seemed to do the trick<br>  by tues night they were regular<br>  good luck you cant be like this much longer 4cms sounds promising <br>   fingers crossed for you x x x x|`|AA10478146	I'm with you.... 40 weeks and 4 days and I too have had similar contractions.  I'm 2 cm and 70% with my first baby.  I hear early labor can be longer for 1st time moms.  The waiting is driving me nuts but, I think we just have to deal with it.  Take the Ambien and get lots of rest.  Good luck!|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	I don't think you'll wait much longer, considering the stage that you're in. But more often than not, doctors want you to be at home and as comfortable as possible during the early stages of labor. Just keep the phone close at hand!|`|1hciyvKdaa	My daughter just had her baby early sat morning. She was overdue by a week, although a month earlier they reset it a week earlier so then she went a week more to the earlier due date so go figure!  She went in at 1cm at 70 the day before and was sent home, her water broke that night so then went in, at about 9pm, not sure if/when meds were given or not, epidural at 3am when the pains got really bad and  baby came at 5am. Its a not fun waiting game! I guess they dont want to induce you for some reason, paitence its getting really close. The baby is just taking control of your life already hun, get ready pretty soon it will be in full control!!! Congradulations!!|`|vjoyv5J6aa	Your baby just isn't ready! I know it sucks! BAD but they come when they come. I hear that if you push at all and the baby pushed against the cervix, it will actually cause it to slow down the process. Relax, take a warm shower and lay down. It better you're home then there. You can eat,drink and use your bathroom. Just watch out, some people deliver on the toilet.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Some women are just like that. i would probably give it another 2 weeks or so, if not earlier.<br>  My bff is going through the exact same thing. Hang in there!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Walk around your house as much as possible, have a nice relaxing bath and then do it all over again. It should not be too much longer if you are already at 4cm. <br>  <br>  They sent you home because most hospitals have a bed shortage and they assume you will be more comfortable at home. I never was! <br>  <br>  I think if you hang in there, walk around, wash, rewash and fold all the cute baby clothes you bought, get the crib bedding clean and put on the crib so everything is just perfect for when you get home, everything will be just fine :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I know how frustrated you are.  When I was 3 months along I started getting BH.  MD said it was fine.  I went to the hospital 3 times to stop contractions.  At what I thought was 36 weeks they started again.  I went to the hospital sure that my MD was going to deliver since she said she would and I was already dilated, etc.  The MD on call sent me home because I was 1 hour away from 36 weeks!  I was so frustrated.  I had contractions all night and into the morning.  They were every 3 minutes and I didn't sleep a wink!  They tapered off by mid morning.  Then I she didn't come until I was 39 weeks!  I did everything that people told me would bring on labor because I was soooo tired of the BH all day every day.  Nothing worked.  That baby is not coming until she/he is ready.  I know you are ready.  Good luck.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	I went in to L&D when I was 35 weeks and 6 days because of labor contractions. By the time we got to the hospital it was on top of each other. In fact, by the time the nurse behind the desk came around to ask me a question I was huffing and puffing! My hubby and I went to the room where they strap you with those monitors. Twenty minutes passed and nothing. Then nurse came in to check me, she said I was 2 cm 80% efface, she could feel the baby's head. Keep me around for an hour to see if I progress. Then BOOM, back to back contractions, 3 minutes a part. She came back and rechecked me and she said I wasn't progressing, gave me two choices tylenol & benadryl or ambien. What the heck? She basically told us that if I go to active labor that they will not stop me because in an hour I was going to be 36 weeks. I have fast labors, and I do mean fast.. 1 hour. So for the doctor who never spoke to me, recommend that I drink Ambien to knock me off my feet is especially careless. I have high pain tolerance, my last child I gave birth to him an hour after I drove myself to the hospital at 8 cm dilated. I was furious! I went home contracting still but had taken the tylenol with benadryl to ease off the pain. I am now 37 weeks and 1 day and still no baby. I am surprise as hell, I have always premature deliveries but, my daughter hang on!!! Woohoo.. I am now officially full term.<br>  <br>  Since that night I have had BH but, nothing stronger. This is sort of uncharted territory for me since the longest I had before was 36 weeks, now that I am 37 weeks I'm like.. ok.. now what? Come out!!!!!! lol
WpGROxH8aa	Its understandable to have nervousness and mixed feelings surrounding a pregnancy. The fact that its a boy might have set off your anxiety but if they baby had been a girl, something else may have made you nervous. Having a baby is exciting but its also a big change so anxiety is perfectly normal.|`|QSodlfMraa	yes it does make sense congratulation man, you want to have a father-son relationship and you going to have it.|`|gdnL63ngaa	Of course it makes sense.<br>  Actually hubby and I are happy we're having a boy. The little teenaged slutty-dressed teen girls freak us out! Plus I was a bit naughty when I was young  too.<br>  <br>  A boy will be awesome! Just think of the sports you can play with him, he can help you work on cars in the garage, or he may take after mum and bake with her in the kitchen!<br>  <br>  Best wishes, I'm sure you'll be an absolutely wonderful father. Its natural to be nervous!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	He's not a photocopy of you - remember that baby (boy or girl) is an even mixture of mom and dad's genes: 50% mom & 50% dad. <br>  <br>  Be happy either way - they could be wrong. I was told my daughter was a boy, bought everything blue and sports and here popped out a girl! Greatest surprise of my life and I'm VERY happy my daughter is first born! <br>  <br>  Congratulations, dad!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	lol!  You make your children what they are!  If you want him to be just like you, you will form him into it.  Think of that baby as a fresh piece of canvas.  You will give him experiences that will make him who he will become.  Like an artist painting.  I have 2 sons.  None act like my husband,or how he acted when he was younger but one looks just like him!|`|AI2VoFP4aa	definitely makes sense. in my case its the opposite, my husband and i are having a girl and he is terrified he says that a boy he would know what to do with but with it being a girl hes lost.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	haha yeah its normal.  and makes sense.  Remember that just because your son is your dna does not mean that he will be all you.
Fkl6gV8Qaa	I don't think that he would even tell you if he didn't think that he knew. We found out we were having a boy at 14 weeks. Although it doesn't happen a lot it is possible to know that early.|`|QSodlfMraa	just wait, good luck and congrats.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	the gender starts developing around 11 weeks or so.  A friend of mine found out she was expecting a boy at 13 weeks also.  It is so much easier to see boy parts this early rather then girl parts.  I saw her ultrasound picture and you could definately see the male parts at that stage.  With ANY type of ultrasound at any time during pregnancy, you should never be 100% sure.  There are parents who are told their baby is one gender, then when baby is born, it's the other.  So always take it with a grain of salt.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	At only 13 weeks, I wouldn't go out buying anything blue.  Just wait.  When you are more like 18 or 20 weeks, then you can assume that the ultrasound accurate.  That being said, its still not 100%.  At this point and time, he's simply making an educated guess.|`|AA11612508	i would assume with about 80 percent. as in, tell friends and family, we are not hundred percent sure as of right now, but it pretty much looks like a boy. I would just say your having a boy.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would just assume he is correct but I wouldn't go buying anything until your next one just to be on the safe side.|`|AEyztU2laa	It depends on what kind of ultrasound you had.  There are many types and different ones will be more or less accurate with a foetus that far along.  At that stage a foetus is more likely to look like a boy than a female anyway.  It may be true, but I think you'd be silly to assume the foetus is definitely a boy.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	I wouldnt assume anything until atleast 17 weeks, but usually if they think its a boy its a boy.
BUOJJpaCaa	Graph it (either on paper or a graphing calculator).<br>  Look on the line/parabola that is graphed for the points.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	Ask this is the home work help section.|`|6lSbmXunaa	Hey Girl!<br>  <br>  Well, what they're giving you are plots. Make a graph and plot the points they gave you.  To be honest, I'm not sure what the first part is, but I do remember learning about functions of X.  Sorry I wasn't much of a help! Try asking this again in the Homework section, although everytime I ask something there I get 0 answers so I usually ask here first too :) haha Good luck! If it's not graded for accuracy, try your best!
MtC3CWZraa	I completely understand why you don’t want to be outside in the ice. That said, if you’re asking to be let out of part of your job as a result of your pregnancy, there needs to be an actual medical reason for it. “I’m pregnant and don’t want to” isn’t enough. <br>  <br>  The problem is that it opens the door for abuse.  They let you out of one responsibility and next month you’re asking to be freed from something else just because you don’t want to do it.  Then you’re getting into situations where other employees see you getting special treatment and it just snowballs into a big mess for HR. <br>  <br>  All that said, your doc may be willing to write you a note for this issue. Mine certainly told me that I should stay home if the weather was bad to avoid falling.|`|OU9xnW86aa	Your doctor will know what to put in the note. They do it all the time! Try not to stress about this.<br>  <br>  Congrats!! :)|`|3qI1oyFaaa	If it isn't stated in your job description as part of your duties, then she doesn't have a right to need a note for you to stop. If you chose to take on extra tasks as a favor, you should have the right to quit taking them on when you feel it is unsafe for you to continue. I would explain to your doctor what a jerk your boss is, and request him/her to exxagerate the hell out of what you're unable to do while pregnant. I would bring in a note saying that the only times you are requried to get out of your seat is to pee and eat, anything else or anything more often is too much... Ugh. That upsets me. Thank God you are leaving that job soon. I have similar duties in my job, walking back and forth outside all day, but live in San Diego where the weather is nice. If it's raining or too hot or too cold, my boss won't LET me walk. He requests I either drive or don't go at all, for my safety. That's how it should be. Your boss sucks.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the pregnancy and good luck!!|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	Unfortunately, you can never start something that you will not continue to do.  It is sad that you volunteered for the extra task and that they won't give you 11 weeks off from this duty so that someone else can step up and help with this task until you come off maternity leave or either make a change.<br>  <br>  I hope you are getting mileage or gas from this, too.  Get all you can for using your vehicle.<br>  <br>  Definitely get the note and dig your heels in on this one.  Talk to your doctor and tell him/her the situation and I'm sure he/she will have a good idea what to put in a note.  Perhaps, no lifting or no excessive/unwanted walking, or a note that strictly specifies your daily tasks should be restricted to sitting only.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|WPI0Z47saa	Your doctor will know what to write. It sounds like your boss is just being a jerk. You could put in a complaint but it might not do much. Now if she fired you for not doing the errands then you can get her into trouble or god forbid if she made you and you got hurt. I would just get the note to keep her quiet and protect your job and put in you complaint to HR just in case she tries to harass you about it. Just take care of yourself and your baby. You are doing the right thing. Good luck.|`|bo4MguzVaa	Your employer sounds like a jerk.<br>  And the are obviously ignorant they could be liable for your injuies you aquire on the job.<br>  <br>  Have the doctor write a note you aren't to be running errands on foot in the weather, but you are ok for desk duty.|`|jGOPgcw5aa	If you were hired to perform a desk job, then HR should definitely be there to defend you on this one!  That's THEIR job!  As long as you are performing the duties you were hired for (and get paid for), then I don't see a problem with you saying no to what was voluntary errand running.<br>  <br>  As for your doctors, ask him to outline your desk duties as acceptable and anything requiring you to walk outside as unacceptable.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  I hope you're quitting after the baby's born - your boss sounds like a jerk and I doubt they will forgive you for trying to change things up!|`|7kosr9mcaa	You think thats bad!!! I was pregnant working as a civilian at the military base here in London Ontario and they wanted a doctors note to say i couldn't lift boxes or carry them from one building to the next. LIKE HELLLO I'M PREGNANT AND ITS OBVIOUS I'M NOT LYING!!! Sometimes people can be really stupid. I would just explain the situation to your doctor, like you did here, and then he/she can write you a note.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: by the way they HAVE to make the appropriate accomidations for your pregnancy, its the law here. It is perfectly understandable why you don't want to make these errands. THERE IS A RISK THAT YOU CAN FALL ON ICE AND INJURE YOURSELF OR YOUR BABY!!! Who ever said "i don't want to" isn't a good reason...well there is your reason.
JFbWyKKDaa	Its totally okay!  My son didn't roll over from his back to his tummy until he was about 6 months... your baby is fine.  Give him time on his tummy to enable the development of core muscles used for rolling/sitting up and eventually walking. The more tummy time, the better.|`|A1QpwziEaa	my son just turned 4 months old on saturday and he doesn't roll over either....my baby book says the milestone can occur between 2 and 4.5 months but there's a big asterisk next to it and it says that because of the "back to sleep" campaign babies show delays in rolling over....apparently, stomach sleepers rolled over a lot quicker.  I'm not concerned, he's ahead of or right on target with everything else.|`|lpVgMkgcaa	i wouldnt worry, my daughter didnt roll over till about that time as well.  Babies will go at their own pace!  I was always reading books and websites to see the milestones and then worry if she was hitting them accordingly, and usually she was on, but there were some thing, like rolling over, that took her a little longer.<br>  <br>  its ok!|`|uLeg1Aniaa	My son didn't roll over until about 6 or 7 months.  I was worried also and talked to my doctor about it and he said most babies don't do it until 6 months.  It sounds like he is very close to doing it on his own.  I say give it another month and he will be rolling all over.|`|0JHqXKciaa	My little girl was 3 months when she rolled over but your little guy will do it in his own time.  When he gets on his side help him over to his belly, maybe once you show him how a few times he will be able to do it on his own.  If he is developing well in all the other areas I don't think it is any cause for concern!|`|AA10186411	My daughter couldn't roll over til about 8 months.  Granted, she had a delay.  But its fine.  Alot of babies haven't rolled over by 4 months.|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	my little super baby rolled over in the hospital. but she is a year old and just learning to walk. babies do things at their own pace . dont worry too much he will eventually do it when he feels ready
yrBSkJKGaa	No matter what you do, your baby will likely put up some sort of a fuss during the flight.  Try to have your baby drink juice during takeoff to help stave off plugged up ears.  Hopefully you will get lucky and he/she will fall asleep as some point.  But travelling with infants is never fun.  Just get through it as best as you can, and don't worry about other travellers giving you irritated looks.  Such is life.  Good luck!|`|vue9NOhYaa	He'll be fine.  Babies tend to be happy as long as they are with their parents.  Nurse or offer a bottle/pacifier on the plane. Anything that encourages baby to swallow.<br>  <br>  You dont' say what you'll be doing on the vacation, but again, babies are very portable, and will be fine in a museum, on the beach, in a restaurant, or whatever.  Take advantage of the ease of traveling with an infant.  Toddlers/preschoolers are much harder!|`|sv4guUQNaa	my in-law has been traveling with her son since he was about 2 months.  Like you read, she gave him a bottle to help with the elevation change.  Her husband works for an airline so they travel often and it's no problem for her or her son.|`|37vaYaRFaa	they will be absolutely fine- won't know what is going on and will probably sleep most of the time. I wouldn't recommend it from your point of view- major hassle trying to find baby friendly hotels/places to warm bottles, sterilise equipment and warm food. You will probably be absolutely exhausted at this stage from getting up throughout the night consequently you won't enjoy the vacation. I am talking from experience, I went on holiday with a 6 month old but never again!|`|ELoFSv55aa	Hiya ignore that first one, i have a 6 month old atm and just got home from england, the plane can hurt there ears but they should be ok, mine cried alot on the plane but she was fine. i think she felt a bit un easy when we got to england, she was very upset the first few days but she soon settled so i wouldnt worry if i was you.|`|VrPyp1APaa	We took our baby on a 6 hour road trip at 6 weeks and he did fine.  He slept most of the way and only woke up once to eat.  He is 5 1/2 months now and we are getting ready to take him on vacation again.|`|rFFWrRxEaa	it will be new to her/him   she/he will act just as usal unless something she/he doesnt know upsets her/him it will be a screaming  baby and probaly wont stop till you put her to sleep
bipLaDk7aa	stop worring .if he was wearing a condom there is no need to worry.  and if by chance you are not sure that he cummed inside u or not....just relax. a girl gets pregnant after many attempts . this was ur second intercourse, well the chances of getting preg are very less. this is because the vagina of a girl treats the sperms as a foreign body for few initial intercourses till it get use to .|`|3427eebd84da66693a5d9d29a3fcc54caa	You should take a test AFTER the date of your expected period You can take it the day after that date for the best result, or a few days later is even better; since HCG levels vary from woman to woman.<br>  <br>  Also pregnancy symptoms such as morning sickness, and breast tenderness, don't show up for a few weeks. <br>  <br>  So relax, and take a test when it is time.|`|BEjZ1wUgaa	You can take a test now to find out. Nausea, dizziness, throwing up in just a few weeks are symptoms along with tender breast. However, not everyone will experience this. I have had 3 children & had no symptoms for for the first two except a missed period, the last one I had all symptoms for 3 - 4 months.|`|k6x2lVLYaa	Spotting<br>  Darkened Nipples<br>  Tender Breasts<br>  Tender Stomach<br>  Lower Back Pain<br>  Morning Sickness - Really Runny Nose, Throwing Up.<br>  Head Aches<br>  Missed Period<br>  Eating more then usual<br>  Losing apetite for certain foods<br>  Cravings<br>  Fatigue<br>  Sensitivity To Smells<br>  Feeling bloated<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Take a test in a few weeks or so;<br>  but, pregnancy symptoms some times can be mixed up with just regular pms.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	I am SOOOOO tired. I can barley stay awake during the day. My chest is also sore. Mostly around my nipples. I tested positive after being a week late.|`|NNwEuC8paa	You are prob thinking too much into it! relax! wait until you miss your period then take a test! You can look for headache, more cervix mucus, sore breast with blue veins (sometimes) if you have to pee a lot. .
xm1NjRqSaa	My Dr.'s Always scheduled me at about 10 Weeks. I don't see what the harm of waiting two more weeks is. Your not a First timer you know all the rules already. I'm sure you already know this but, I'd start the prenatal's now.|`|vBR9nB81aa	I went at 7weeks. Then again at 12 weeks. Then every month or 2 after that. BUT I was on perscription meds, so I needed to be monitored closely by ultrasound and such to make sure my baby was growing properly. I also had to go to a perinatoligist(sp). Good luck!|`|AA11210211	I went in to my first app when I was about 8 weeks with both my pregnancies.As soon as it was confirmed I was pregnant I made an app.|`|yznZqcznaa	Wow my first was at like 3 weeks 6 days.

I'm sure you'll find one that will work for you and your husband.|`|uBXtBirUaa	we just bought a really cool skater backback for our diaper bag. I figure for the most part, if we go anywhere, Daddy will be the one carrying the bag, so we figured we should get something that he wouldnt mind wearing. And skater backpacks have SO MANY pockets in then, which i heard will be like life saver. I do have a cute coach bag for myself if i intend on going by myself, but it only has like 2 really small pockets.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I don't know if you would consider this unique, but my husband and I plan on buying a backpack and having our baby's name embroidered on it.  My husband said he would feel more masculine carrying that as opposed to a regular diaper bag.  :)|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Phil&Ted's! They have a website that lists where they have retailers in each country.

2S48PpV5aa	I'm only 6 weeks, but I have an appt for 8 weeks to do our first ultra sound!|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Only not a very good doctor would not do another one. They did mine at 10 weeks. They have to do it after you are pregnant at least once to check your cervix, and as you get further along and it is almost time, they will do several more exams to see how much your cervix is dilated. At 8 weeks I got an ultrasound to see when my due date was and if I had one or two or more, and of course the urine sample and the bloodwork I do almost every time lol|`|B11nrKmdaa	most doctors will go ahead and do one just to be on the safe side. If you are going to the same doctor that did your pap in January he may not do one. They may also do some blood work on you to check your HCG levels, it will tell them about how far along you are. They will check your fetal heart tones and do a check to see how big your uterus is getting... that's usually about it for the first visit.|`|3az8caS9aa	I had a pap smear done in October and we conceived in December and the doctors told me I don't require another pap smear, as long as there is no reason from the last one.
654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	This is when it is so great to have a church to fall back on...or a neighbor you have grown close to.  If you don't have a church, you may consider attending one....NOT so you can find a baby-sitter...that would be absurd.  But, often, when couples, especially with no other support system, begin coming to church, they often make attachments to others, they are cared for, and come to care for the people as "second family".  <br>  <br>  That being said, that will not solve your problem at this moment.  Do either of you have someone at work who adores babies and might be willing to babysit for a few hours on a Saturday or Sunday, either for pay, or as a favor?  Someone who is "grandmotherly" but has not grandkids, or has grown-up grandkids and misses babies?<br>  <br>  Or...does anyone at your work have teens who baby-sit?  I would rather see you have someone come in who is attached to someone you know, rather than someone you don't know.<br>  <br>  Of course, you could hire a local neighborhood teen as a "parent's helper" and they could come in and help out while the two of you stay there...say on a Saturday evening, you could order Chinese, have the "helper" come over to take care of the baby and you could have your dinner in the dining room, and let her take care of the baby...pretend that neither of them are there.<br>  <br>  It might seem weird at first, but once you were sure that this person was bonded with your baby, you would feel better about going out on a real date.<br>  <br>  It is vital that you have some down time, even if you sit in the kitchen and read a magazine and drink coffee....I'm sorry things are so crazy...but it won't always be that way.  Like you, we had no back up, and our son was three before he spent the night away...and we have never had a trip without our kids, though most of our friends have taken cruises, etc. without their kids....it must be nice!<br>  <br>  My two boys are teens now, and if I lived down the street from you, I'd babysit for free some evenings, just to get the chance to snuggle and cuddle and smell that baby smell!  I do miss that so much!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!  E-mail me anytime you need some encouragement...<br>  <br>  Oh, BTW, I am a Hospice volunteer....is your M-I-L using their services?  They are covered by insurance, and if there is no insurance, they will still care for her and donate the care...they offer respite care, so that if your husband is having to do things for his mom, they could help with some of that...just a thought...|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Sorry but I am going to give you that "smug attitude" you didn't ask for...<br>  <br>  That is what you signed up for - you do get a break by going to work every day.  Not all mothers/fathers get that break.  My husband is a SAHD and he doesn't have one moment to himself.  When I get home from work I focus on the baby but he still has other baby/house related things to do and never gets to just relax.  Our only break is an hour or so before bed time.<br>  <br>  We don't use baby sitter either and Elyse has never been away from us and she is almost 11 months old.|`|AA10953561	It's just a waiting game for now. Your son will need a lot of attention, just make sure you're not over doing it. Put him down for bed at a certain time every night, that way you start his routine young and might have an hour or two to yourself after he's in bed (even if it's just to do laundry).<br>  <br>  It might be hard to get him into a routine, but if you're consitent then it'll work out for you!<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon!|`|qSmCA82Aaa	Our daughter is 17 months old and just stayed the first night away from us Friday night.  We have three children so it's very rare for us to go anywhere too.  You can still have some time together though.  Just this weekend we put our children to bed and then just drank some beer (And I don't even like beer) but it was nice relaxing.  We usually snuggle up and watch a movie together at night though.<br>    Once you have kids you usually just learn other ways, trust me with three it's hard to find a sitter but as he gets older it will get easier.|`|AA12080472	my husband and i used to take turns when we had no babysitter to get a break. i know its not together but at least u can have alone time. <br>  <br>  u  can put the baby to bed 2 hours earlier and spend quiet time together at home. <br>  <br>  we usually had babysitters, so it was rare.|`|3vbHZBioaa	It becomes overwhelming when grandparents are unavailable and you just need to get away..I would ask siblings if there are any..or ask your friends who they use as babysitters..Always make sure you are comfortable with a sitter and check all references..If your friends have reliable sitters I would use one of theirs..Best of luck|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Neither of you have a sibling that could watch your son?  What about hiring a babysitter?  You could ask the daycare providor if they do any babysitting.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I have no break either, but I don't expect one.  My inlaws and the rest of my family are 4 hours away.  My back-up is my husband, his back-up is me.   Nobody else keeps her, we have had a babysitter twice, and have another one booked for march 13th (she's 23 months).  <br>  She goes to daycare during the day, so I cherish every moment I spend with her.  <br>  <br>  If you're that desperate, find a babysitter.  We didn't leave my daughter overnight until she was 13 months, and that was with her grandparents.<br>  <br>  You are asking for the "smug" attitude.  Just because some people have no back-up care does not mean they are "content to martyr themselves into slavery".  It's called sucking it up because we have no other options.<br>  <br>  I think what you are missing is that everybody would love a break, and yes we all deserve one but not everybody has that option available, whether they want it or not.  You are not the only one.  If hiring a babysitter is not an option for you, and you have no other back-up then you're pretty much SOL.   Might as well make the best of it.|`|yFX0mdOhaa	For all those critical of the original poster:<br>  <br>  I think it's important to realize that we all have different goals and aspirations.  For some people, being a mother or a father is their life's calling... for others, it's merely one part of their identity.  I think it's unfair to put our own values and goals on someone else.  Some of us are happy financially if we can pay the bills every month... other's are not happy unless they are growing their net assets by 20% anually.  Some of us could care less about their weight, others are not happy unless their bodyfat is under 15%.  Some of us are happy to have a job, others are not content unless they are pursuing their life's work.|`|K7O4v0lQaa	hi love I personally think Maureen and Meggies answers are right for you, I had same prob my baby refused to sleep the first six month due to health conditions and due to my deafness carrying her around all day in the fear that someone in the block of flats we lived in came to mu door to tell me my baby was crying so I got very afraid that someone might dob me in hubby and I had to eventually work together  first we had to establish a routine bedtime away from mum as again due to my deafness I kept her in a crib by my side of the bed we never had any family nor friends either no time for us for even a little toger on the couch to watch a movie so to say really affected our marriage those whom say welcome to mother hood arn not thinking of this very important aspect if mum and dd is not happy baby is not going to be happy either they can feel it. Hubby was marvelous he put her in her very own special cot in her own room and attended to her everytime she cried for attention as she was so attached to me made sure she was clean dry comfortable and always gave her drinks of water took six months but she did finally settle down and we got to have some special times again together.I have also been a single mother with no-one at all and those whom say they can do it so you must be more than able to like me back then did it because had too even though was very burned out mum which led to a cranky mum and problem behaviour kids as well as at school thie impact of being a single parent child really effected my kids heaps they were bullied,embarrased many times I think the best is to start with getting bub into a rgular rutine this may take some time staying up late does not always work as my hubby worked days and i worked nightshift as a sen.Regristerred Nyrse so doubly hard to have time together no one can truly judge you nor your situation as you are a unique couple and many probalby cannot grasp your life situation but i can say this without family or friends it is so very hard.try and think up creative little ways to help and support one another and your baby so that you are working toward having some time for yourselves good luck hope all goes well for you personally i do not envy parents today as in my day there were at least for many a neighbour willing to help share take bubby or the kids one weekend so you can have time out and vice-versa society is just not like this anylonger sad hey|`|mWZE7gF7aa	Is this a joke?<br>  You want him to be away from you all day while you are at work and then you need a break at night too?  Didn't you know when you had this child that he would always be with you?  Just FYI, most children do not spend a night away from their parents, especially that young...am I misunderstanding something here?|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Look around for a cheap sitter , give her a good interview , ones with children are always better. I put an ad on craigslist and found a great one with children my kids age. When my hubby and I want some US time we ask her to watch them for a ew hours and we get it.<br>  Its hard , when being parents its hard to get US TIME I know been in the game almost 4 years and its always us and the kids , but honestly I love it. <br>  My hubby and I also try to schedule our day around getting some us time. Like taking the kids out and making them tired and do not let them take a nap so they go to bed early and we get time together. <br>  good luck hun ....fyi its called parenting! its hard to get a break!|`|TTKJHK7qaa	Your question doesn't make sense first........if you and your husband have a son........ his mother is dieing ...... cant be you.... you are working......... and his father lives away from y'all... cant be your husband .........then cant be either one of you guys kid.<br>  So I think the question is a joke or miswwordedone.......<br>  He is YOUNG... there are plenty of things to do with him or keep him entertained from johnny jumpers to walking seats where he can play and turn on cartoons or elmo or whatever he likes and get yourself an hour here and there.|`|P8vDSIpNaa	Good luck getting sympathy on this board.

Thank you."|`|a0svO2Sbaa	I would just get a legitimate, kind, even tempered baby sitter.

He is your son, and there are two of you. <br>  ANswer seems pretty simple to me.<br>  Im a single mom, so rethink what you say when you have no break EVER. You have a husband and you two should be able to give eachother a break.<br>  <br>  It isnt that I "am perfectly content to martyr myself into slavery"<br>  It is that I have a son, and he is my responsiblilty. I do not expect a break, and I wouldnt come on here complaining that I "never get a break". And for you to have a husband and say that..then I think you could easily solve your own problem. I dont have anyone else, which is why I do not get a break, you two can work together, there is no reason why you both can get a break.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	My husband and I rarely go out... We usually wait until the babies are close to a year. We have 4 kids, and our baby is only 4 months... Since I'm nursing her, and suck at pumping, I'm not ready, yet, although I do want to go somewhere! Anyway, we're lucky, in that we have grandmas in our area, but, if we didn't, I would hire one of those babysitting services, where they're CPR and First Aid trained, and come prepared to really interact with your child... They have been screened, etc., and charge a reasonable price... Best of all, they're also available, last minute! ;)<br>  <br>  *edited* I'm not going to say "That's what you signed up for," because I know a lot stay-home moms---myself, included, who occasionally would like a break, yet they get the "It's what you signed up for" speech... And, guess what? They don't like to be told that!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Welcome to motherhood sweetheart.  When you and your husband chose to start a family, this is part of what you knew would happen.  YOU (and your husband) are solely responsible for this child.  I doubt you gave birth to him ready and waiting to pass him off to someone else so that you could have a "break".  There are no "breaks" in parenting.  Especially within only the first year.  Its only been 5 months and you are already desperate for a break?  lol  You have a LONG road ahead of you my dear.  I'm not even sure why you feel like he needs to spend a whole night away from you at such an early age.  I also don't understand how you could need a break when you are already away from him for at least 8 hours a day as it is.  I remember rushing home as fast as I could once I got off work just so that I could be with my son.  I suggest you find a friend or a good babysitter if you are wanting a date night or something like that.  Otherwise, surely you and your husband have at least one day off a week.  When you do, take turns watching the baby while the other goes out to lunch alone or something like that.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	He is five months old so I can't imagine why he ever would have spent a night away from you. Give each other breaks. One of you watch him while the other takes an hour or two to just relax or go out. Then switch. I know it seems tough sometimes but he is your son and he comes before everything else now. It may be awhile before your husband and you get to go out or get a break at the same time but that's what having a kid means a lot of the time. Try to keep in mind that he will grow fast and be gone. Enjoy the time you have to take care of him.<br>  <br>  EDIT*** <br>  Honey if you see this as martyrdom and slavery you should not have had a child until you were more prepared. Not trying to be a b**** but really, this is being a parent, not being forced into a horrible situation under threat of death. A LOT of parents don't do things like your friends do. Hire a sitter if you're alright with that and I'm sure you knew you could do that before you came on here and asked.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Would your daytime daycare provider be interested in babysitting in the evenings every once in a while?  <br>  <br>  Other than that, my husband & I make a point of staying up late some nights, no matter how tired we are, to have some grownup time together, after the kids are asleep.  Right now, your son may not yet be sleeping through the night, but he will be soon.|`|lzivF4Idaa	well im in the same situation except its only me. i dont have my childs father in my life and he's 6 months old and has a chronic illness which makes me mommy, daddy, and nurse. how do i do it? what do i do? i just get over it and do it cuz my son needs me. if i can do it, you can do it. <br>  <br>  best of luck|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Yeah, I'm w/Brody's Mom on this one.  Work it out w/your hubby, take alternating breaks.  <br>  <br>  I'm a single mom.  I'm lucky enough to have family that will take him if I'm completely at the end of my rope, but it takes a lot for me to actually get there.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	My husband and I have a 5mo old and a 10yr old. My oldest spends the night over friends house every once in a while but the baby is always home. We choose to not send her to someone else's house to be babysat. At her age, she is just too unpredictable and may have a day of fussy fits or not. We can't explain to her, as we can my son, that we'll only be gone a few hours and we'll be back. No one I know, including me, wants to be around a baby who's crying ever few minutes. As a parent, I know I have to but I don't have to subject anyone else to it. Therefore, we don't get a break from the baby. <br>  <br>  My husband and I haven't really wanted to do anything. It's cold outside! I personally don't like to hang out in the cold. I live in the city where I was born and raised so I have family to watch my kids whenever hubby and I are ready to go out. But, if I was in your position, I would play hooky from work and find something fun to do during the day. I don't know if you do but I accrue leave on my job and can take off here and there whenever I feel like it. When you have no one else to depend on, you do it yourself. In your case, you have to alter when you do what. So instead of going to a club on a Friday night, opt for a noon day movie. Or just stay home and get "a little closer" to your husband. When you become a parent, you have to get in where you fit in. So, if you have to schedule your fun time around your mommy time, that's just how it is. Priorities should come first. Everything else can wait.|`|AkFag8tNaa	That's how it is. We rarely get a sitter either. I don't mean to be cold, but this is what you signed up for. Find someone through work that you can trust....<br>  <br>  It's not a smug attitude, it's just reality. My parents live over half and hour away as do the in-laws. There are people in other places that don't have olive garden and wear their babies to go get drinking water from the public well. I consider my life pretty golden compared to those people so going out without my child is a luxury.

If there is spare change you may be able to buy a picture frame or a book.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	To be honest...best thing would be to ask the expectant mother and then she can give you ideas as to what she needs,rather then you waste money and they get something they dont want : )|`|dyHKPlgZaa	toys, a giant stuffed animal, clothes, shoes :)|`|629b2a254146ba15b3a5223b9513e6b0aa	a very nice picture frame is always a lovely baby gift... something the parents can put a beautiful picture of their new one in to display.

You can buy them in Argos with little teddy bears. About ￡20.
WPI0Z47saa	This happens alot in pregnancy and is normal. Your body is producing so much extra blood to support you and the baby. Your body is putting everything that it has into making this baby and it really takes a toll on your body. I am 23 weeks pregnant and will feel great on moment just standing there cooking dinner and then BAM I feel like I am dreaming, fell light headed and dizzy and feel nauseas. This will happen alot especailly while you are standing and your body is telling you that it needs to put the baby first and you need to rest and take it easy for the moment. Sitting down with something cold to drink and maybe a cold towel for your head helps. I used to keep a fan close by because the cool air blowing in my face helped alot. Just make sure that you do not lay on your back because this will make it 10 times worse when you try to get up. Either sit doen for a couple of minutes or if you can lay on your left side. It will usually pass fairly quickly but can happen quite often and will happen off and on for the remainder of your pregnancy. Everyone that is pregnant experiances this sooner or later. Good luck and I hope this was helpful.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	The same thing has happened to me a couple times, and it scares the hell out of me. It definitely doesn't seem normal, but I've asked my doc and she says it is, just to be sure I'm eating and drinking enough fluids. I'm pretty sure it's due to a sudden drop in blood pressure, but I don't know what causes the BP to drop. Sorry, I wish I had an explanation for it...  Good luck, and I hope you go the rest of your pregnancy without another scare...|`|stD14wWaaa	It happened to me today. I was busy talking to my manager then suddenly my vision was unclear then all I could see was black, I thought I was gonna fall down. I guess it's just normal especially if you're doing some work because the baby is sharing energy from your body.|`|a8ws0XVtaa	i had those sypmtoms as well throughout my pregnancy.  My doctor said that it was normal and not to be alarmed.  Also he said that if it occurs most often after eating, then it is because all your blood goes to your stomach to help with digestion of your food and leaves you dizzy and faint. Good luck|`|c0plf0VLaa	Check with your doctor immediately; I believe this could have something to do with blood pressure and sugar in the body!|`|6PEOqeLOaa	it is common in pregnancy what your experiencing. I myself have gone through the same thing. In my case its my low blood pressure and low protein count. Make sure you have protein through out the day i found that i only really ate anything with protein in it until dinner so thats why i was feeling the way i was. make sure you have peanut butter/eggs/sausage (one) for breakfast and something small for lunch...def talk to your doctor about what your experiencing it could also be your blood sugar count...good luck!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Your body is circulating so much more blood right now, that it can cause you to get dizzy while standing for too long. I never fainted once before in my life, or in my first pregnancy. In my second pregnancy though, I fainted a good handful of times. It's nothing to worry about, just if you feel that way again, sit down immediately! As you saw for yourself, the feeling won't just "go away" it gets worse!
c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Abundant clear stretchy CM is the time your are ovulating and the best time to get prego. If it's watery or lotion like, you are less likely to concieve. Also watch for dull aches in your lower abdomen (like AF cramps but more mild) That is also a sign of impending ovulation.|`|1663aacaf477ab5d8cb4705d60ab324faa	How long have you been ttc? Because pinkish blood in your cervical mucus can mean either of 2 things, 1, it was probably implantation bleeding or 2, ovulation bleeding. I started taking vitex for 2 months now and I notice on day I ovulate, I get blood in my cm..good luck to you and wish you many blessings!|`|hmOidFp3aa	The type of CM you get when you are ovuating is similar to egg whites, clear and pretty stringy! So the watery discharge wasnt, and if the stuff you have now is stringy then you are! Good luck and tons of baby dust!|`|HSUfe3m7aa	It's the clear egg white type that is fertile. If you put it between your fingers it will stick and stretch out between them.
bBWHrEciaa	Discharge is my one tell tale sign that I'm pregnant! My girlfriend was the same way as well. She told me she had it and I immediately knew she was pregnant. When the discharge shows up around a week or so before you are to get your period and still remains when you are due to get it. I would suggest buying a new test. Sometimes you can buy a test that could have something wrong with it. My girlfriend got paranoid in her 9th week of pregnancy and bought a test and it came up negative. She freaked that she miscarried, went to the doc, took another and it was fine.|`|53GH38Qiaa	Sounds like your prego to me! The bleeding was probably just from implantation. Pregnant women also have more discharge in the first trimester. Have you checked your cervix? Pregnant women also have a high cervix...but it's not necessarily a good way to check since some women will have a low cervix and still be pregnant...but take another test in a week or so.|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Sounds like you are to me.  Pregnancy test!!|`|asCxBiVuaa	From the sounds of it....yes you are pregnant. I'm 3 monthes...didn't find out till I was 2 months....and I had the SAME exact symptoms. Except for I also had morning sickness like mad......but the wetness and discharge is SOOOOO a sign. When I finally went to the doctor I asked him about the discharge and being wet all the time and he said since I'm pregnant my vagina is "secreting" (kinda like cleaning itself) all the time and getting ready to have the baby!!! Weird huh!! About the home pregnancy thing.....forget it...go to a real doctor and get a blood test, or you can do the pee test if you don't like blood, and he or she will let you know for sure.|`|OdFIQYyhaa	yes i think your pregnant it hasn't happened to me because im a male yo!!|`|AA11363993	probably not, sounds like it could be a yeast infection. I'd go to the dr.
ev0SHwMyaa	You're on day 34 so i would say you can test now. I got pregnant with my first son the first month after coming off bc. Best of luck to you.|`|ce8COixxaa	This is definitely the time to take the test, as you would probably have been expecting AF a few days ago! Good luck and Baby Dust!<br>  <br>  I am just a little behind you! I stopped BC in Feb and got AF on my expected week and fertility friend tells me that I am fertile this week and ovulating on Friday so we are BDing throughout the week and I am already waiting until the day I can take a test! (the expected date of my next AF is Friday the 13th so hopefully that will be LUCKY 13 for me!)|`|yea2hci5aa	It's very rare to conceive right after stopping bc.  Of course there's always the chance but it takes your body a while to get itself on a cycle on it's own.  Of course while I was on bc I had the standard 28 day cycles because the pill were guiding it but as soon as I stopped my cycles could last as long as 40+ days, it was hard because I would take a hpt only to see a bfn.  Luckily it took my hubby and me 4 months after stopping bc to conceive our daughter.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  and I think that you should buy a hpt kit with at least 3 pee sticks that way you can test now and then save the next two for the following weeks in case you get a bfn.
3I3Thz6waa	To be honest, the drink was sweeter than the 1 hour test. The only major discomfort though was having them draw the blood over and over and over again. I was really scared about the results to begin with, so I think I made it a little worse for myself by being stressed, but I passed my 3 hour test (thank goodness), so it can happen!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|m8aqAZgJaa	Its the same drink. I did ok with the drink for the 1 hour test but because you have to go so long fasting with the 3 hour test the drink made me so nauseus. The only think that you can do is sip on water and hope you dont get sick because then you have to repeat it. It may seem sweeter to others because of how much longer you have to go without eating|`|3K7ffKn2aa	It is sickeningly sweeter. lol the first one was only 50 this one is 100 (don't know the units). But yeah it is really REALLY sweet. No need to be afraid of it though its not gonna be the worse experience of your life or anything. You might feel a little sick after drinking it on an empty stomach so if you plan on going home for that hour have a ride.  Good luck on your test.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I didn't notice they are both pretty hideous.  I brought a straw, and a cooled thermos to get it down|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	It's the same drink.

I put in a tampon thinking it was my period coming early ( I wasn't regular ) but the next day there was nothing on the tampon and 3 days later I still had not started my period so I thought it odd that I would have some bleeding like that and not get my full blown period within a day or so. I took a hpt and it came up faint positive. If you are experiencing implantation bleeding you should be able to take a hpt and get a positive. Good luck:-)|`|6zPCQ7rPaa	for me it was especially scary cause i had just had a miscarriage afew weeks before. it was like spotting, almost brown like old blood. if you get alot go to the er they can treat you with iv and check you just to be sure|`|gCCkDLMHaa	spotting is perfectly normal durring pregnancy, ask t he doc.<br>  i know its nothing to be worried about.|`|OU9xnW86aa	I had implantation bleeding.

BTI0XOptaa	Head lice actually prefer clean hair because it makes it easier for them to move around and to lay their eggs. <br>  <br>  The ONLY safe way to get rid of head lice permanently is to use a totally natural alternative to the chemical shampoos then use prevention methods such as hairspray and tea tree mixed with water in a spray bottle every day to ensure they never return. <br>  <br>  Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a pesticide treatment (over the counter shampoo) please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. They are also ineffective as head lice have become immune to them. i find it quite disturbing that people would suggest to put these chemicals on a 5 year olds head. <br>  <br>  Luckily there are quite a few totally natural remedies available that readily kill head lice.<br>  <br>  Suffocation is an effective method where oil based products (i.e.: conditioner) are used to block the breathing holes and kill the live lice. The real trick though is to find natural products that will kill both the live lice and their eggs in one fast effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Remedies containing Neem Oil are known to be highly effective as Neem interrupts the growth and reproduction of the head louse. Neem’s insecticidal properties are widely recognized now and the oil is commonly available at your local health food store.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following site for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|im3vWyv6aa	It is so easy these days for children to catch lice.

I soaked their hair in vegetable oil and wrapped their hair in suran wrap... then I put a shower cap on and left it on for like 4 hours. After 4 hours rinse her hair in really warm water and shampoo.<br>  <br>  You will need to go through and try to pick out the nits. I did that before the oil treatment and after.

Then, you apply for WIC if you don't already have it to help with healthy groceries. You can see if your health department has any programs for low-income parents. And start trying to save. It's hard, but it can be done. Also, go to the courthouse and set up an appointment to get child support from your childs father.

Don't be ashamed for getting public assistance.  YOu have a job and pay taxes!  This is why the govt. formed these programs. To help those who truly need it.|`|bNuuxJv1aa	Go after him for child support and apply for food stamps. Then you should at least try to find a better job even though there is none really out there.

Do you have WIC for your daughter?  If your boyfriend is the father of your daughter, apply for foodstamps and medical and the state will then help you get child support, which he should be paying. If he's not the dad, they can help you get support from the guy who is.  Even if you don't want the money, remember it's for the child, and she has a right to support from both parents.<br>  **EDIT** What state/country are you in?  You may be able to prove paternity even if bio dad is in prison (perfect time to have him tested, since the state knows how to find him).  If you sue for child support now, they may be able to add to his probation/parole conditions that he 1)get a job 2)keep a job and 3)pay child support and stay current.  You can get child support without letting him know where you or the child are if you're afraid of him, but you may need an Order of Protection which shouldn't be hard to get if you had him arrested and he's serving time for rape.  He may not be able to pay now, but will when he gets out.  Can you call the prosecuter on his case and ask them what you can do about support and keep yourself safe from him at the same time?
BW7Nrqjzaa	Quitting smoking wasn't hard for me. It was not starting again that was so difficult. There was so may times when I wanted to have "just one"... But I just kept picturing my poor baby having to take in all that nasty stuff.<br>  That was almost a year ago and I still get cravings. I want to start again but I know I shouldn't. Especially since I'm a nurse.<br>  <br>  The hardest thing for me lately has been keeping my house clean. It seems like every time I start cleaning he wakes up... My house is driving me crazy. <br>  <br>  Oh and the whole giving up sleeping thing hasn't been fun this time around. With my first two I could always just bring them into bed with me and at least rest for a little while longer. Now if I try and do that my older two would reek havoc on my house and get into all types of trouble.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Oh god the hardest thing for me was quitting smoking!<br>  I was a full on smoker and i only found out i was pregnant when i was 16 weeks along. I know crazy, long story! lol<br>  <br>  Well i had smoked often during that time so the amount of nights i fell asleep crying because of that...it just broke my heart that i may have harmed my baby. Then quitting was equally hard! I knew i was going to do it, i was determined but there was sometimes i would come home and fall back on a cigarrette...then i would just cry afterwards and getting angry and breaking it up! lol<br>  I finally was off cigarrettes 2 weeks later! yaay!<br>  <br>  So yeah, that was by far the hardest thing! Oh that and missing out on a 2 piece swimsuit this summer :(|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Yeah quitting smoking was hard and I only smoke socially. I think the hardest part was trying to sleep in my last 2 months. I am a cranky monster when I dont get sleep and I worked until the Friday before I delivered! So getting up at 5 am to get myself and my older daughter ready in the morning with such crappy sleep the night beforel....that was the hardest!|`|FHT6wsUpaa	I stopped drinking soda and coffee 3 months before I got pregnant. That was really hard. I went through caffeine withdraw, and I was tired and cranky all the time.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I miss SLEEPING!|`|AA11903503	Smoking and sleep. To this day I still miss smoking and want to light up everyday...If I wasn't gonna smell like smoke coming back into the house I would probably do it (i don't want my baby to associate me with that smell or have that smell transfer to my baby).<br>  And sleep, oh how I miss sleeping for 10 hours straight...or even sleeping in. I worked mid-day so I never had to get up early.|`|qStmw7qgaa	OH!  I missed sleeping on my stomach!!!  That I think was the hardest.  That and I was pregnant during the summer time, so I missed having margaritas w/ my mom and sister in law during family BBQ's.  But hey!  I have a gorgeous and health baby girl who simply completes mine and my husband's life.  :-D|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	i quit smoking and drinking.. i love my beers.. <br>  but for me the hardest thing was consert going. i go to conserts all over the usa and usualy go camping at them. my favorit one is coming up and its a 4 day festival in tn (im from ma) and ill be 9 months. no way i can go this years.. supper bummer.<br>  <br>  but i all ready love my baby who is only 22 weeks in the making. and cant wait to see the little bugger...|`|UXhFcHCHaa	pizza. i could only eat from pizza hut bc the rest had to much garlic. i also couldnt eat salads, strawberries, and when i had gd it was that much harder. i also quit drinking but i dont mind now. ill have one and be good.|`|TJ04fAgNaa	I had GD too and giving up the ALL of the sugar was soooo tough, but I did it and became a poster child for healthy eating, lol.|`|eaO0MRaBaa	Giving birth, Parenting came natuarally. It was worth it though.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I had GD as well, that was very difficult.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I think being pregnant was the hardest. For both boys I had really bad morning sickness that lasted 3 months. And not to mention the last 2 months of feeling I want it out now! I loved the in between months. Both my labours were short (first 3 hours and second 1 hour).<br>  <br>  As for giving up things I miss my sleep, and drinking with friends into the wee hours in the morning. I also liked having lots of alone time, which is pretty non-existing with two kids. Also the pressure of being responsible for two other little people is kind of hard sometime.<br>  <br>  But when it comes down to it we all know that giving up these things is nothing compared to the reward of having kids.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I'd say pregnancy.  It last nine months!  :)<br>  <br>  The hardest thing to give up while pregnant was my occasional glass of wine.  It was nice to have my one glass of wine every now and then.  I had to stick to chilled grape juice.
bo4MguzVaa	You would have to have intercorse to be pregnant, so it's not pregnancy.<br>  <br>  There are many possibilities for the pelvic and anal pain, not sure if the runny nose is a symptom of the same thing or just a coincidence.<br>  <br>  Have it checked out by a doctor is the best advice really.|`|NNwEuC8paa	There is no way you can get pregnant if you haven't had intercourse.

SEzIkGNiaa	I get an allowence every 2 weeks.  I get my allowence in age, so 16 every 2 weeks.  I only get it if I do good in school, good attitude, and my chores are done.<br>  <br>  Allowence also teaches you responsibility.  <br>  I also babysit, so I don't get all my money from my parents.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	however much your parents think appropriate (not on the high end of what people are suggesting, though).  (if you're really a "never get caught" girl rather than a pretty good kid, I'm guessing less is better.  don't use an allowance to get into more trouble, please.)<br>  <br>  but if you're almost 16 i'd say much better than an allowance is a way to actually earn money.  tutor, or babysit, or mow lawns, or something.  then you're getting pocket money and getting some experience.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	I used to get $20 a week.

My daughters at 14, got jobs and earn as much as $500 per month.  They get top grades, volunteer, and work hard.  Why don't you get a job or babysit if you don't want to commit to a regular schedule of work?|`|hJWjSWYXaa	$40 a week! Of course I've never gotten an allowance because I''ve been working since I was 14 so I guess that sounds good that's how much i would get in tips a week as a busgirl.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Whatever they think is the right amount.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	First do they give you the money to go ot with fiends, game at school, new clothes, cds and everything else a kid wants?<br>  <br>  My daughter is 16 as far as an allowance no she doesn't get one but we pay for her car, the insurance, gas, money fr time with friends, cds and everything else.  She does earn extra money by doing the laundry or something along those lines.  We gave her the choice an allowance and we gave her nothing else and she had to make it last for all the fun stuff or the way things were.<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents and go from there.  Tell them you just want some cash on you for when you are out and see what they say.|`|1enIWBGnaa	YOU should sit down with your parents and discuss this!<br>  And, you need to do more chores.<br>  I have 3 grand daughters (age 10 and twins at 12) they have been doing the following for over 6 years now; keep their room clean, sweep, vacuum, dust (the entire house), help with meals, fold their own clothes (from the dryer) and put everything away, load and unload the dishwasher and pick up dog poop.  Now, how much do you do......|`|OpVysSzQaa	I wouldn't give a kid over 14 an allowance. you're old enough to get a job. we're in a major recession, nobody can really afford to spend much on their kids' frivolous spending sprees. if your parents cover the cost of your needs (toilettries, clothes, school stuff) then just get a job and you can buy whatever you want else.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Depends upon what you will be doing with your money.  If you are gong to buy clothing and other, it should be about $75.00  per week. If it is walking around money and you continue to get good grades $30 to $35 per week.|`|ruczpWrGaa	at your age i was getting about 40 a month.  It might help if you step it up a little at home.

If you have a cell or other monthly bill that they give you , consider this as well since they are already providing something that to many are consider an extra luxury anyway, which with your grades and helping out seems like your mature enough to understand all of this and be grateful for any decision that they are able to make on the allowance part. Also I wanted to say congratulations on keeping your grades up and being responsible. That goes along way these  days I am sure that your parents are very proud of you.<br>  <br>  Sorry didn't see the extended part of your question about there income <br>  anyway, it is all the parents and what they decide but wanted to say you sound like a very mature and responsible person. Good Job|`|eV6MHADQaa	what's appropriate for you is what your parents can afford. but at 16 you shouldn't be thinking what someone can give you . you should be thinking how much can I earn ?their are millionaires out there under 18 how do you think it happens???|`|28QPS6V9aa	Fifteen dolars every two weeks then when you turn sixteen get a part time job after school and make your own money.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	If you are getting good grades and helping out at home, they should give you at least $20.00 a week.|`|LeIS45Ekaa	well i i don't get any allowance and im 16 too  it is up to your parents .|`|a0c3f773818ae282515a565aa454bcd6aa	$25|`|KUxEBQuYaa	i had a job at 16. so i wouldn't know
Mp9SaP1iaa	I understand my body cant take any BC or condoms yeast infection and rash. I had the  hardest time getting pregnant not to mention I have hypothyroid which is hard also but it seemed that when I started to take prenatal and figuring my ovulation day it was a whole lot easier. Also try having sex every other day or every other couple days for the whole month or two (except on period of course). I hate to say but I used a calender and bought stickers (three different colors)  marked the day of my period when it started and end then marked my O. day and when we had intercourse to help me pin point the possibility of becoming pregnant I very embarrassing but true it helped me out alot.  I found out I was pregnant just a week before valentines day. And we have been trying for almost 7 months.|`|3Ks21ASDaa	yes take prenatal vitamins and just remember it's not easy to get pregnant. use an ovulation predictor to figure out when you are ovulating then have sex everyday 5 days before that and a day after. the best thing to do is talk to your doctor. there could be many underlying factors as to why you aren't pregnant. your doctor can prescribe some vitamins to take that would help with getting pregnant and would be a lot more helpful. just keep trying and it will happen when it's supposed to!|`|DTVJtHYLaa	no matter what you do or try you will not get pregnant until god thinks its time for you..try using an ovulation calander it will give you days when your most fertile so you know when to have sex..don't stress about it it will happen when you least expcet it.|`|edglcOydaa	It sounds like he is past his sell-by date anyway so might not be able to produce.

Go to babycenter.com they have a lot of information. I'm sure you've investigated a lot of things already but if you know your regular schedule and all that you should be able to find out what the best days are to have sex. What you could do is count 14 days from the first day of your last period and start having sex every other day from then until when your next period should be starting. Hope everything works out for you. If you've been trying for a year or more I would go to a fertility specialist.

x10qO89saa	totally normal! my daughter would get them in the womb also. and once she was out, same thing, whenever she ate she would get the hiccups, some  babies get them more than others especially if your baby had them when he was inside.|`|5lmGvQzQaa	I'm certain that your not feeding him too much, everyone hiccups and its harmless to your baby health wise, he sounds like he's doing fine.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	it is normal and does not bother the baby at all...do not worry.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Its totally normal for babies to get hicups.

cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	Depending on which pills you're taking (I assume you're taking a 3 week series that doesn't have a week of "fake" pills) you do have to stop taking them in order to have a period.  Just stop taking them and your period will start again within a couple of days.  They used to tell us about that neat little trick for when we wanted to skip a period for a month for a specific reason (like if we were going to be on military operations that week, the week you get married, etc).  It's not good to do very frequently though; your body needs to flush that stuff from your body.  You'll be fine.  Know, though, that you are supposed to take the pills for 3 weeks then stop for a week so you can have your period.<br>  If you're taking the kind that have a week of "fakies" then take them as normal, don't stop taking them.  If you don't get your period next month, see a doctor, as it can be a sign of something else (I knew a girl who had a tumor in her uterus when she was 14, and she stopped having a period and started growing like she was pregnant.  She was still a virgin, and it freaked her out.  When she saw the doctor they had to cut it out.) more serious.  You should always keep track of when you had your last period (mark it on a calendar) so you can tell your doctor if you have any problems like this.  When you become an adult they'll ask you for that date just about every time you visit the doctor, so it's good to get in the habit.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	take the pill at the same time everyday.  continue taking it.  when you take the placebo pills you will get your period.  never stop taking the pills.  take them at the same time everyday.  if you have questions ask your mom or call your doctor.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	You do not discontinue taking birth control pulls for the week when you're period starts or the week you are supposed to have it. They come with a separate row of pills (placebos) that do not contain any hormone which allow for you to have your period. If you are on the three week pills, take the 3 weeks of pills, stop for a week, then restart.<br>  <br>  Most birth control pills, however, follow the 4 week plan.|`|LcOPL8gCaa	So you didn't have sex right? I think then its just the stress you don't have to stop taking the pill when its your period, its suppose to help your periods stay regular. Just call your doctor, and ask. Its easy hun.<br>  Don't worry, its just gonna make it worse, you don't have to stop taking it either.<br>  <br>  Good luck & Best wishes!|`|hnICmxMoaa	in the first place remember that because you got your period only a year and a half ago..irregular periods are normal<br>  most girls the first 2-3 years have it irregular..one month yes 3 months no...<br>  for all the other question you need to read the label on the pills ..since i assume you don't have the label anymore go ask the pharmacist or doctor
B9KwqnuDaa	Every baby is certainly different so I can't really tell you specifics. <br>  <br>  I'll just tell you want my boys do/did. When my first son was 2 (3 in a couple weeks) he would get 12 hours sleep at night and a 1-2 hour nap in the afternoon but started being up all day at about 2 years and 7 months. He would play on his own  for about 20 minutes at a time about 3 times or so a day. There were days where he would watch no tv at all but most of the time we would watch approximately 90 minutes of tv a day, always a movie we don't have cable. Right now my boys don't really spend any time alone but they do play with each other.<br>  <br>  My 6 month old sleeps when he is tired and it's starting to take the form of 2-3 naps a day for about 1-2 hours each and going to sleep when we do (we co-sleep) and waking when I do so about 7-8 hours.<br>  <br>  I would never let a child of any age cry it out.<br>  <br>  My 6 month old breast feeds about 8 times a day for about 20 minutes. He hasn't really shown any interest in eating solids yet.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i hav etwo teens and when they was babies i would keep them busy all day unless they went and layed down and just fell asleep they would be doing somthing and my lil one wouldnt eat anything but what he wanted and i took him to the dr. and she told me to just be glade he is eating! he will grow into alot of things and for the tantrums you got to put your foot down and no matter how much he cries you be firm and kepp showing him it will be your way! after a while he will learn it wont work! good luck!|`|nZVGUzZzaa	umm when my oldest was 2 he would sleep for about a 2 or 3 hour nap durring the day, he would go to bed at 8 or 9 and get up at about 6 or 7 in the morning, when my youngest (who is now 10 months) was 6 months he would get up around 5 or 6 take a nap around 9 or 10, take another nap around 2 or 3 and then go to bed around 7 these were the times that he would just fall asleap or get extrememly cranky, he does still to this day wake up around 1 or 2 times a night.<br>  <br>  at 2 he should pretty much let you know how much is ok, hes not going to come right out and say "ok mommy i'm done playing by myself" but he will give signs like getting into things, that is when he needs a little extra attention from mommy, and at two i wouldn't leave him alone with the 6 month old at all, he doesn't realize things that he thinks are helping or fun could actually hurt the baby.<br>  <br>  depends on why the baby is crying at 6 months old if he seems to be crying just too cry i would set him down and let him cry it out because by 6 months old he should have learned to self sooth<br>  <br>  umm at 6 months old my youngest wouldn't touch baby food but would eat any regular food that i offered him, and did really well, and he would eat when everyone else did, breakfast lunch and dinner, and at some meals he would eat more than the older children and would still take about 36 oz. of formula a day, it toatly depends on the child he will let you know if he is still hungry or if he is done and doesn't want anymore
562qoBUUaa	I think they should be able to. What really makes a good parent in my eyes is an involved parent who always puts the well-being of their kids first. Really all a child needs to succeed are loving role-models and the unconditional support of a family. Single parents, homosexual parents, and heterosexual parents can all be successful at this. Tradition doesn't matter. Love, support, and guidance are enough.|`|P8vDSIpNaa	I struggle with this question. I feel pretty certain that many kids adopted by, say, lesbians feel very fortunate that now they have loving "parents." Other kids, upon getting older and realizing the stigma society puts upon their "family" are angry and embarrassed. They long for a traditional family and wonder why God put them in this situation. <br>  I heard a boy being asked, "does mommy want you to have this?" and he said, "I don't Have a mother.: and the guy goes, "what do you have?" and he said "daddy one and daddy two." And looked sad. But I felt he loved both his dads. So I just don't know . <br>   Maybe this is wrong, but I think it would be good if homosexual couples could adopt older children living in foster homes and allow newborns to be adopted by straight couples. It's very confusing.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I think anyone who will love---and properly care for---a child, should be allowed to adopt, after a thorough process, of course... After all, they would be subject to investigation, unlike most people... And, certainly not all people who give birth, or deposit sperm, are good parents.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	As long as the couple is able to financially and emotionally care for a child, they should be allowed to adopt.  Sexual orientation does not matter.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Anyone who is willing to responsibly & lovingly take on the care of a child should be able to adopt/have children.  What they do in the bedroom, who they love in consensual adult relationships, has nothing to do with the ability to parent.|`|H2IqzG12aa	I like the "Stone Soup" cartoon from a couple of years ago where one mother commented that a new middle school teacher was on the carpet because parents thought his lifestyle was "too alternative".  Just then the other mother's 13 year old stormed into the house, slammed her school books on the table, ran into her room and loudly banged the door closed, which led her mother to comment, "I think they should fall on their knees and kiss the feet of anyone who would take the job!"<br>  <br>  Which is to say, bless any manner of couple that is willing to open their hearts and home to otherwise parentless children.<br>  <br>  As to having their own, I understand and appreciate the desire, but I kind of wish they wouldn't.
WPI0Z47saa	I experianced that alot with my first son. I am 23 weeks pregnant now and it just started happening again. I will feel fine and be cooking dinner or something and then out of no where i feel like I am dreaming  and feel light headed and sometimes a little nauseas. This is normal during pregnancy and you will probably experiance this off and on for the rest of your pregnancy. You just have to sit and rest when you feel like this and maybe get a cold glass of water and a cold towel for your head. I used to feel really hot with my first and always had a fan near me so that when I felt like this I sat in front of it for a few minutes. Make sure you do not lay on your back because this will make it so much worse when you get up. Either sit and relax or lay on your side until it passes. I wish that there was more to do about it but it is just a part of pregnancy. Just wanted you to know that you are not alone with this. Good luck.|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	I had shortness of breath horribly bad during pregnancy which can cause faintness and dizziness.  Unfortunately, I didn't move around or do a lot of work around the house during the last few months.  <br>  <br>  I'd suggest going to your doctor and taking a breathing test.  Find out if you are getting enough oxygen.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	try caring around crackers also that might help you. But some women do have these dizzy spells when pregnant, just talk to your doc at the next apt and she'll probably have something for you. I didn't have them as often but i did have times when i would see the room leaning and realize i was falling. I have dizzy spells but not as often as you, luckily i have a sit down job and i can just close my eyes until it passes. Good luck hope your ok.|`|a8ws0XVtaa	I had those symptoms as well and the doctors all told me that it was normal and that nothing was wrong.  I had it throughout most of my pregnancy, it is just one of those unfortunate things about pregnancy I guess. I gave birth at 39 weeks to a healthy baby boy.  Good luck and congrats on your little one|`|bo4MguzVaa	My first thought was some sort of anemia...maybe not iron if they tested for it, but could be b-12 or somthing.  Here's part of an article I found:<br>  <br>  What are the most common types of anemias to occur during pregnancy?<br>  There are several types of anemias that may occur in pregnancy. These include:<br>  <br>  anemia of pregnancy<br>  In pregnancy, a woman's blood volume increases by as much as 50 percent. This causes the concentration of red blood cells in her body to become diluted. This is sometimes called anemia of pregnancy and is not considered abnormal unless the levels fall too low.<br>  <br>  <br>  iron deficiency anemia<br>  During pregnancy, the fetus uses the mother's red blood cells for growth and development, especially in the last three months of pregnancy. If a mother has excess red blood cells stored in her bone marrow before she becomes pregnant, she can use those stores during pregnancy to help meet her baby's needs. Women who do not have adequate iron stores can develop iron deficiency anemia. This is the most common type of anemia in pregnancy. It is the lack of iron in the blood, which is necessary to make hemoglobin - the part of blood that distributes oxygen from the lungs to tissues in the body. Good nutrition before becoming pregnant is important to help build up these stores and prevent iron deficiency anemia.<br>  <br>  <br>  vitamin B12 deficiency<br>  Vitamin B12 is important in forming red blood cells and in protein synthesis. Women who are vegans (who eat no animal products) are most likely to develop vitamin B12 deficiency. Including animal foods in the diet such as milk, meats, eggs, and poultry can prevent vitamin B12 deficiency. Strict vegans usually need supplemental vitamin B12 by injection during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  blood loss <br>  Blood loss at delivery and postpartum (after delivery) can also cause anemia. The average blood loss with a vaginal birth is about 500 milliliters, and about 1,000 milliliters with a cesarean delivery. Adequate iron stores can help a woman replace lost red blood cells.<br>  <br>  <br>  folate deficiency<br>  Folate, also called folic acid, is a B-vitamin that works with iron to help with cell growth. Folate deficiency in pregnancy is often associated with iron deficiency since both folic acid and iron are found in the same types of foods. Research shows that folic acid may help reduce the risk of having a baby with certain birth defects of the brain and spinal cord if taken before conception and in early pregnancy. <br>  What are the symptoms of anemia?<br>  Women with anemia of pregnancy may not have obvious symptoms unless the cell counts are very low. The following are the most common symptoms of anemia. However, each woman may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:<br>  <br>  pale skin, lips, nails, palms of hands, or underside of the eyelids <br>  fatigue <br>  vertigo or dizziness <br>  labored breathing <br>  rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) <br>  The symptoms of anemia may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your physician for a diagnosis.<br>  <br>  How is anemia diagnosed?<br>  Anemia is usually discovered during a prenatal examination through a routine blood test for hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. Diagnostic procedures for anemia may include additional blood tests and other evaluation procedures.<br>  <br>  hemoglobin - the part of blood that distributes oxygen from the lungs to tissues in the body.<br>  <br>  <br>  hematocrit - the measurement of the percentage of red blood cells found in a specific volume of blood. <br>  Treatment for anemia:<br>  Specific treatment for anemia will be determined by your physician based on:<br>  <br>  your pregnancy, overall health, and medical history <br>  extent of the disease <br>  your tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies <br>  expectations for the course of the disease <br>  your opinion or preference <br>  Treatment depends on the type and severity of anemia. Treatment for iron deficiency anemia includes iron supplements. Some forms are time-released, while others must be taken several times each day. Taking iron with a citrus juice can help with the absorption into the body. Antacids may decrease absorption of iron. Iron supplements may cause nausea and cause stools to become dark greenish or black in color. Constipation may also occur with iron supplements.<br>  <br>  Prevention of anemia:<br>  Good pre-pregnancy nutrition not only helps prevent anemia, but also helps build other nutritional stores in the mother's body. Eating a healthy and balanced diet during pregnancy helps maintain the levels of iron and other important nutrients needed for the health of the mother and growing baby.<br>  <br>  Good food sources of iron include the following: <br>  <br>  meats - beef, pork, lamb, liver, and other organ meats<br>  <br>  <br>  poultry - chicken, duck, turkey, liver (especially dark meat)<br>  <br>  <br>  fish - shellfish, including clams, mussels, oysters, sardines, and anchovies<br>  <br>  <br>  leafy greens of the cabbage family, such as broccoli, kale, turnip greens, and collards<br>  <br>  <br>  legumes, such as lima beans and green peas; dry beans and peas, suc|`|vjoyv5J6aa	I had that. It sucks, but your baby is needing more blood these days and your body is pumping up to give it to the baby. You baby is number one for blood and when you stand up you might not get all you need. I had pregnancy brain bad (felt like I was loosing it) forgetting things and such and the Dr. said it was from lack of blood. I would get dizzy and faint and it was normal. Remember your body is all out of wack. I'm 33 weeks now and its a lot better. Not running marathons but I'm more regulated when i stand up and sit down. I still feel it when I over do it though.

dDVAUA9saa	I'm 23 weeks and 3 days and have gained 12lbs.  I was underweight to begin with so my midwife has suggested I should gaine between 26 - 40 lbs.  With my first, I only gained 18lbs so 26 might be a stretch....|`|v3LnJycKaa	I am 23 weeks today, and so far I have gained 1 pound, but this is my 3rd child so maybe my body is used to it???|`|zwJbUbWMaa	At 23 weeks I had gained 7 pounds but I already had a lot of extra weight when I got pregnant.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	I felt the same way. At 21 weeks I had only gained 7 lbs, which was exactly the same as my last appointment a month prior. At 26 weeks I had gained 17 total, though. I'm pretty sure there is still the couple lb difference due to water weight, etc. just as before we were pregnant. As long as your doc hasn't said your weight gain is unhealthy, you're fine. And the weight will come off after delivery, so try not to stress too much.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	i lost weight at the beginning over been so sick went down nearly two stone. weight starting to pile on now tho in bout the last 2 weeks over half a stone :) healthy baby :)|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	With my first I had gained atleast 15lbs, this time I am 19 weeks and have only put on 2lbs.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	I gained almost 17 pounds by then. And was freaking out that I was gaining too much weight. I mean, I don't eat horribly. It's not like cuz i'm pregnant i'm like oh yeah, let me eat that hot fudge sundae or cookie, you know? Maybe it's just my body. But my upside is, it's all belly and boobs, and i'm so thankful for that. I'm now almost 31 weeks and have gained a total of 25 pounds I think. I gained four my last appointment, which is good, because it was four weeks after my previous one. I say, don't really worry too much, or it'll drive you crazy, trust me. Just watch what you eat. It's alright to indulge in something junk once or twice a week, but not all day every day. And then, you should stay on track =] Good luck.|`|27619df890eb68d8ffaf95f7eb7644e0aa	I am 25 weeks and 4 days pregnant, with my daughter i had gained a whopping 20 lbs at 25 weeks!!!

pvH3oHRfaa	I have the same thing. I think it's something to do with my perineum where it tore during child birth, it's more sensitive now, and gets hurt during sex. But I also have the crampy feelings. Not sure, but the lady above thinks we should see a doctor!|`|AA10063059	any bleeding after intercourse you must see a doctor|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think that is normal.

l4mMBe5Aaa	By 8 months old, our daughter was eating 3 meals a day, along with her formula.  She was enjoying small pieces of soft-cooked vegetables and fruits that she could pick up and feed herself (she MUCH preferred anything that she could feed herself).  The websites below have sample feeding schedules and examples of foods that 8 month olds can be eating.  <br>  Our daughter just turned 12 months old, and no longer takes formula.  She eats whatever we eat (which helps us eat healthier!), and she drinks whole milk.|`|HT3Jyhmgaa	My daughter is almost nine months old. I "try" things out every once in awhile. If she is reaching for something (within reason) I let her try it. She is eating stage threes and some people food if appropriate.|`|HIRYscJlaa	at 7 months my son eats solids twice a day and two bottles...I will probably be bumping him up to solids three times a day very soon...it's important to transition them slowly.|`|kjgonYlgaa	At about 6 months both breast and formula fed babies should be started on some solids.  Starting out with simple single grain cereals like rice, introduce a new food every 4-5 days. Watching out for allergies. Best to keep to basic cereals for the first month or so, (iron fortified by now they need this) Then graduate to mixed grin cereals.  After about a month start introducing different solids, vegetables first and probably for the longest, to get them used of the different tastes.  As for "people food" your little one can have some of yours and by 8 months is definatly ready.  All I did for mine was take plain foods, no butter salt etc... and puree it (I love my magic bullet blender) if it is a little thick add a tiny bit of water, it's great to make a little extra and freeze in portion sizes (an ice cube tray works great) Portion sizes are quite small right now, like a table spoon or two (she'll let you konw).  Make sure she gets her formula first before her meals. this is most important, but you need to start giving her some variety in her diet, she's not too young for three meals a day (even if they are all cereal right now) Keep her solids thin to start and once she's a year old gradually switch her to cows milk (homogenized).  save meats until she's closer to a year old and eggs and peanuts until she's 2.  If you choose to make your own (its not as ahrd as some people think) its healthier for her and costs less.  Keep on hand for the times when you go out,  a couple small jars of store bought baby food .  Just pop one into your bag with a spoon and your set!  I Hope I've been of some help.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Most babies by eight months ARE eating a fair number of solids.  Is she getting so little because she won't eat it, or because you don't get around to offering?<br>  <br>  At this point, I wouldn't bother with purees at all.  Most 8 monthers can eat table food, so I'd be focusing on that. 1-3 times a day, as is convenient for you and fun for her,  offer some soft, cut up foods. (Food that you cook for your own meals is fine.)   If she can eat them, she will. If she isn't interested or can't, wait a few days and try again. Formula is still the main part of her diet, but she should also have the opportunity to eat some solids.  <br>  <br>  Formula is usually stopped at around 12 months, but if your baby is a poor eater of solids, it's wise to stick with it a while longer. You would continue offering regular solids (yes, 'whatever you're eating for dinner') AND some formula.
iFAlZfVMaa	I have to agree... one can be off but 3 different scans giving the same story is less likely to be inaccurate... hang on till the 3D and see what the drs say... and ask for a 2nd read from another sonographer and dr if you want a nother look... good luck... i hope everything turn out ok.|`|v3LnJycKaa	yes 1 ultrasound could be wrong, but unfortunately they have done 3 scans specifically looking for one thing, and they have seen it each time, there is a good chance it is present, but from what I understand sometimes issueswith kindnies in a fetus can resolve themselves before birth.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	3d and 2nd level ultrasounds are much more accurate. They allow them to pinpoint things not able to be seen on regular ultrasounds.<br>  <br>  Rest assured that finding things early is a good thing! The earlier the dr's know, the earlier they can have a plan to fix it.<br>  <br>  Hope all is well with you and your peanut :)|`|WPI0Z47saa	Although ultrasounds can be wrong, it gets less and less likely that they are wrong if you are having multiple tests confirming the same thing. It is good that they are doing the 3D ultrasound. They are far more accurate then the standard ones. I hope that you get answers soon and that all is well. It is always going to be scary when and if they find something wrong with your baby. I hope they don't but if they do just remember how far medical procedure have come and there is usually some kind of solution to every problem. I wish you the best of luck and hope that all turns out well or you at least get some hope that things will work out with medical intervention.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	It is just much more easy for them to see things, depending on how far along you are they can get a pretty good idea if something is wrong and what exactly it is.<br>  I am sorry to hear that something might be wrong, but remember, they haven't said for sure yet.|`|1bnhwGACaa	they told me my youngest had a blockage in his urinary track <br>  at my last ultrasound it was gone so some things can change in utero and be fine
le0LsiVUaa	Personally I don't agree with abortions, they are a great thing to have available fo sho as in certain circumstances they help for example rape. My friend recently had an abortion and I just don't see how a) you would be so stupid to get pregnant in this day in age (I know people have accidents but accidents can be prevented so there really is no excuse). b) killing a life, you may well regret it later in life and always think "what if" and c) So many women can not have children and then you have silly girls getting pregnant snad thinking "oh its fine I'll get rid"<br>  I could never do it.|`|fVmYEazcaa	well personally it's against my beliefs i would not have one but each to their own i think they are handed out too readily by doctors which confuses these poor girls as to what they really want to do.|`|o4fEr5CJaa	My opinion on abortions?

pT7jrsAgaa	Never try to hide "emotions" from your child, within reason.  It's good for them to know that you are human, even mommies get mad or upset.  My kids see me cry and they definitely get to see me mad!

oB8bbiwWaa	How old is your baby?  The answer to your question is contingent on his age.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Once a day is more than ample.  Just offer after any regular milk feed. <br>  <br>  He doesn't need rice cereal at all, and if/when he's hungry enough that you might want to go to twice, you can add a more interesting food like fruits or veggies.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If he's 'almost 4 months' he's really too young for rice cereal. The AAP specifically states that breastfed babies need nothing but breastmilk until around 6 months. (And NEVER before 4 months.)  So I'd probably stop the cereal completely.  If you feel you must give it, definitely offer just once a day, and just a teaspoon or so.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Yes, once the first meal is established you can go ahead and introduce a second one.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	If he is just starting cereal..just do it at night for like 2 weeks..and it doesnt have to be every day either..you can do it every other day.<br>  Once he is seeming to get the hang of it..just move to everyday..but I dont know how  old your baby is..but b/c you dont want cereal to replace any meals..you really shouldnt do it more than once a day until 6 months.. right now he needs all the nutrients he can get from breastmilk.<br>  <br>  If your baby is under 6 months..cereal it this point if just for the point of getting used to a spoon..not for any nutritional purpose..so he doesnt need it everyday or even alot of it.<br>  and I would HIGHLY recommend switching to oatmeal..it alteast has was more of a nutrional value than rice..and is also much less constipating than rice|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I gave rice cereal to my twins for breakfast in the morning.  I never gave rice cereal for lunch or dinner.  I would just keep it to once a day, preferably am.

You know your baby better then anyone, so just go with your gut, and you and the baby will be great.|`|u1DDrXO2aa	I just started my 4 month old son on rice cereal a few weeks ago and the first week i only gave it to him in the morning so that he would get use to it and learn to eat it, but now i give it to him in the morning and evening as well!
FLEXqVoiaa	No Amanda I don't.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	No. I think a woman should be a SAHM if that is what they prefer.

I think a majority of working mothers would love the chance to be home with their babies, but not all families can afford this.  I think they have enough feelings about the issue, and don't need to be made feel worse about the subject.   <br>  Being a good parent is providing for you family, and if a mother needs to work as well to insure this, then that is completely fine.  <br>  <br>  Why not be happy that you have this opportunity and don't worry about others who do have to work. <br>  <br>  Personally, I give credit to those working moms, I can barely keep up with one child and being home all day, much less working a full time job and then trying to clean a home, do laundry, cook, shop, and everything else in only the evenings and weekends/|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No, of course not.  I know moms who work out of necessity. <br>  <br>   I know moms who work because their career is important, supports their family and is a huge part of who they are. I have friends who are Phd's and lawyers.  They wanted kids, but they didn't go to school for 8 years to drop everything.  That is totally understandable.<br>  <br>  <br>   I know moms who work part-time because they like to get out of the house as much as they like the extra cash.<br>  <br>  I think, in 2009, we are way past the "only SAHM's are good moms" argument.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I am a SAHM but I don't think it is the right choice or possible for all moms.

My mother was never there for me and she allowed so many horrible things to happen because she didn't want to stay at home and take care of us.

c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	My daughter couldn't make the (full) switch until she was almost 15mths old. She had a milk allergy that prevented it..which she did finally out grow. I am not sure of the tummy problems you little on has..but my daughter couldn't tolerate any form of milk, except soy. This meant mac-n-cheese, mashed potatoes (with milk), yogurt, etc. All we could do was keep her on her Isomil (per doc orders after her yearly checkup) and just try here & there to see how it effected her. When she started not having any side effects to a few bites of mac-n-cheese...I gave her a two spoons full of milk, then three, then four, etc. We then gave her the normal 8oz sippys she would drink, but making them 6oz formula, 2 oz regular milk. After a few days, we increased, half and half, then after another few days, 6oz milk, 2os formula till she was straight milk.<br>  <br>  Answer is, no one knows if you will have problems...I was told in the beginning that she was shouldn't have any problems switching...but I did. Which is why she didn't switch at her year mark like most children. Trial and error is all you can do...hopefully she will outgrow her problems sooner than my daughter. Good luck.|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	I just changed my one year old daughter from soy formula to a lactose free cow's milk. She is doing okay we mixed half formula half milk for awhile. Depending on if your child has a milk allergy or is just lactose intolerant you may have to use soy milk. I don't think you can just switch over to cows milk, there must have been a reason she is on soy in the first place, that won't just go away. There are many alternatives to whole cows milk.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	my doughter was on good start soy because of tummy issues to she would always spit up. when i switched her to regular milk i would put it in the bottle cause she found comfurt in her bottle more then a sippy cup she didnt mind it at all. after like a week or so i could just give it to her in her sippy cup. y.u can also start giving you child half juice half water. shell like that to. I gave my doughter the milk before naps and bed time and breakfast but everytime else shed have juice. im sure shell be fine|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	do it very slowly by putting cows milk in ceral for breaky for a while and see if there is any change in her poo, then add cows milk to other foods for a while, then give her cows milk (small amount) in a slippy cup or bottle but not has a main drink, just so she get the taste. u can even water it down a little. then add a bit more each week or two till she drinks a whole cup as a main drink.<br>  <br>  my boy is 15months and is still on formula tho, i have only just been doing the breaky thing since he was a yr old i just guess im not ready to move on|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I had to do the same with my first child.  There was a little bit of resistance at first as it was a different taste but soon he loved it and there were no problems.  The rest have been breast fed and as they've gotten older I put them on soy milk as it is much healthier.  My 1 year old is still breast fed and drinks soy milk as well, and I am 6 1/2 months pregnant with the next who will also be breast fed|`|3EhoJ42zaa	My first baby was on soy formula as well.

He learned to sit up at around 7 months, crawling at about 12 months, and walked at 16 months. My second is six months and so far I think he is more physical. He can sit up, push his self up with his hands, roll around, and even get his knees under himself.

That's what makes them individuals.  If you want, you can check out www.babycenter.com  It's got lots of helpful info.  It was one of my favorite websites when I was pregnant, and after my son was born.  I can't really remember exactly when he did what since it was 7 years ago, but I do remember distinctly that he started teething at THREE months!!  I remember being glad that I stopped nursing him at 2 months and wouldn't have to deal with his teeth biting me!  lol|`|nZj78jvYaa	my son is also 5 month old and he is doing all those things the only thing he is doing that you didn't mention was starting in with the sounds the dada dada and the mmmmm and the screeching and cooing. but then idon'tt think there is alot they are suppose to do yet at this age
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	My daughter does have her own play area-our den/living room is actually two rooms but it is open and we use it as one large room, with one side having our baby's toy box, etc.  It helps keep down on the clutter, etc. though it does not eliminate it.<br>  <br>  While our set up is not exactly what you describe, I would NOT leave your young child unattended in the playroom-perhpas while you do house chores, but whiel you are showering is not a good idea.  Even in a baby proofed house/room, injuries can and will occur-especially unsupervised.<br>  <br>  It will not be long before your little one starts trying to climb on those table/chairs, toy box, etc.  My daughter, now almost 17 months old, loves to try to stand on her bouncy ball-as you can imagine, it does not go well.  Just make sure there is a baby monitor in that room, so that even with the door open you can hear what is going on from another room.  Some monitors even have little cameras, which would be good.<br>  <br>  What I personally do, is have the baby near me.  For instance, if I am doing dishes in the kitchen I will have my little one playing on the floor in the kitchen-with magnets on the fridge, sitting in the high chair with a coloring book and crayons, or what not.  It allows me to still get things done, but we are still together and they are supervised while I am doing it.  I always shower early in the morning when she is still sleeping.  You will never enjoy that shower if you have to worry about the baby playing and potentially getting injured.<br>  <br>  I do think the play room is a great idea, but more for clutter issues than leaving him/her in.  Just my opinion, though!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Nope my son has his own bedroom but that's it. At this point it wouldn't work for us anyway. He needs to have me in the room with him almost all the time. I feel like I have a little shadow following me everywhere.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	Thats a good idea. My baby wont have a play room, just the nursery. I would see about toys with buttons that make noises and light up, maybe floor pillows, books, learning toys. Congrats on your new home!!|`|A1QpwziEaa	we currently have a play room because, like you, it's an extra bedroom.  he's 4 months old and we have his toy box, exersaucer, skip hop floor mat, and play gym in there.  when he's able to walk, we'll add a table and chairs and splat mat for craft activities...eventually when he has a little brother or sister, that will become his bedroom and the nursery will remain a nursery.  It's still big enough to have all the toys and a big boy bed....no tv though...I'm going to try and keep him away from that for as long as I can.|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	We had one starting with our first daughter, I always put a play pen in there and a baby monitor 6 months is young to leave in there unattended on the floor when I took a shower I always put my first<br>  In the playpen and turned the monitor on (video one) it was nice later on I could watch her play if I were doing the dishes or whatever.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	I had one growing up, but my son does not..<br>  His bedroom is huge though.|`|HIRYscJlaa	my 7 month olds playroom is the whole house he goes whereever I go so his stuff is everywhere...|`|EoCk1VzDaa	Will you adopt me?|`|2585e7e86671999b1b6f36975e39adf0aa	My girls do have a play room but my oldest one is 4 and youngest just turned 9mos.  So unfortunately it doesn't accommodate both at this time.  There are times however that our baby does crawl into the play room and "big" sister makes sure that there is nothing small that she can put in her mouth and then I'm in there checking about every 3 minutes or so.  But I will warn you now they are awful to keep clean LOL!  The biggest challenge I have is getting my 4 year old to keep it clean.  Good luck.  :)<br>  <br>  We also have a tv and dvd player in there and that is an absolute god send.  Anytime she wants to watch a movie we just put it in the play room and Dad doesn't have to sit through yet another episode of Barney LOL
JT4OSUPeaa	Sounds to me like she isn't ready for baby food yet. Colten didn't take it until recently and he is a little over 5 1/2 months. Our Pediatrician gave the go ahead at 5 months but he wanted just milk.<br>  <br>  Wait a while, maybe try again when she is 5 1/2 or 6 months. She should be ready then.|`|vue9NOhYaa	She doesnt' need babyfood, and she probably isn't ready.<br>  <br>  Most sources recommend waiting until 6 months to begin solids. And while you CAN start sooner, if baby is clearly ready ... it's obvious that your baby ISN'T ready, so there's no point in forcing it.<br>  <br>  You definitely don't want to be starving her into submission. Even babies who ARE getting solids at 5 months are getting them just for fun -- you need to be offering the same amount of milk. <br>  <br>  Just stop solids and go back to breastmilk or formula. In a few weeks, or a month or two, when she seems more interested, try again.  She won't really *need* solids until at least 8-9 months (some sources would say a year), so don't fret, and don't try to force it.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	try something diffrent like a diff food and forget the cereal most babies dont like it|`|0WASp0bHaa	The first thing I did when switching to solid foods was to mix it with formula. It was a very thin mixture. I started with oatmeal or rice from the box (not in a jar) Then I made it a little thicker, then started with jar food. <br>  <br>  Babies can have trouble switching from sucking to using their tongue to push food back. <br>  Also with my baby the spoon mattered to her. She like a plastic spoon that was very small.|`|w1necKzYaa	try using a blender or you can get a baby food blender thingy and feed her table food! o chew it up for her and feed it to her not all babies like that food and I understand Y! lol! also give her vitamins to make sure she is getting what she needs!|`|d5707a466bbd84ff9d6588fbd5cda26aaa	she might just not be ready. she does not NEED the baby food right now. try again in a few weeks! good luck|`|PbBWJGsTaa	All she needs at the moment is breastmilk or formula, and she knows it.  She's clamping her mouth shut because she isn't ready.  Wait a month and try again then.  Better still, when she gets to around 6 months, put some cut up pieces of food in front of her (banana etc) and if she picks it up and eats it, she's ready. If she doesn't, wait a week and try again.  Babies are actually only ready to eat when they can do it themselves, before that, all they need is milk.  Stop upsetting your child, you don't need to.|`|0JHqXKciaa	She really doesn't need solids yet so it's not a big deal that she isn't big on eating them yet.  Don't try to prolong her bottle feeding in order for her to eat the solids at 5 months basically all of her nutritional needs are coming from breastmilk or formula.  I would say give it a break and then try again in a few weeks.  If you really want to continue trying solids I suggest mixing banana with rice cereal.  That is what I did when I started my 6 month old on solids because most babies don't like the cereal so I mixed it with bananas you can also just skip the cereal all together and just focus on her fruits or veggies.  good luck!|`|Kar0HHmhaa	be careful with that kind of stuff, my niece never wanted to drink formula she would throw it up and refused to eat any of the formula milk.<br>  <br>  ends up she's lethal alergic to all dairy, all nuts, and bananas.<br>  <br>  take her to your dr maybe they can suggest something better.<br>  <br>  my baby is backwards from yours, she doesnt want her bottle anymore and wants to eat everything we eat (we dont give her any as she is just about to turn 4 months!!!)|`|jGOPgcw5aa	My boys didn't care for jarred baby food but LOVED real food.  I would mash fresh banana with a fork, steam carrots and then mash them, etc... always fresh fruits and vegetables with no seasoning on them.  Good luck!
XnmFz3Pqaa	Im not quite sure what you are asking?  Do you believe you have an STD?  Have you found out a partner has one and you think you may have it?  Do you think you are prego?  What exactly are you asking?<br>  <br>  From what I can say right now without knowing what you are asking if you have been with someone and found out they had an std the best and smart thing would be to call your dr and let them know you had sex with someone who you think was infected with an std.  They will do a pap and let you know if anything comes back irregular and if it does what you have and what you need to do to cure it.  Im not quite sure what you having your period has to do with having an std or what you are talking about being prego if you already had your period????<br>  <br>  If you think you could possibly be pregnant because you had unprotected sex and he may have *** in you then you would not have had your period this month....if the unprotected sex has been since your period you probably still are not pregnant because its not been time for you to ovulate.  You have to ovulate and release your egg in order for semen to enter it.  <br>  <br>  Here is a ovulation calculator which will tell you when you are supposed to ovulate this month according to your last period.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calculator" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calc...</a><br>  <br>  If this time has not come and you do not want to get pregnant, my advice would be to NOT have sex around those dates...and if you do use protection.<br>  <br>  There are 2 simple answers to this question no matter what you were meaning to ask though...1, is to explain your situation to your doctor and if for any reason you think you may have an std go get checked.  You do not want to let that go untreated!  2, I don't think you are pregnant...and 3, use protection and that will take care of both of these problems in the future!<br>  <br>  I'll check back in to reanswer this question if you can give more info<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	If you had good dates with periods then you  can go for a pregnancy test or HCG blood test<br>  If you had unprotected sex and not sure of partner then you can go for STD tests .. it does not at all relate to pregnancy you might be pregnant and at the same time having STD <br>  <br>  Take care...|`|xm1NjRqSaa	You can got to the Dr. Tell them whats going on they will prob check for the STD and maybe order a blood test. A blood test can be done 10 days after conception.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Go get checked for the STD.  Your period is still several weeks away and if you do have an std, you don't want that to go untreated.|`|c0plf0VLaa	Your question is insanely confusing. If you think you're pregnant or have an STD, either way get checked! If you had your period this month, there's a high chance you're not pregnant. Try having safe sex. Then you won't have to worry about this!!

3tuwWidiaa	What's the point in not approving?  At this point, unless she has an abortion, is there really anything that can be done.  The baby is most likely (short of miscarriage) coming.<br>  <br>  That said, you don't need to support her, if you don't want.  You can say "I think you made a mistake and, because of this, I cannot possible continue to talk to you."<br>  <br>  But why?  What would be the point?<br>  <br>  What you really need to do is support her making some good choices regarding the baby.  Making sure that she, given her age and immaturity, knows what she needs to do in order to keep herself healthy, the baby healthy, plan for the baby's arrival, plan financial issues, etc.|`|bo4MguzVaa	Tell her she needs to tell her parents asap so she can get prenatal care and take prenatal vitamins.  The little baby inside her needs special care to make sure it stays healthy.  She can decide with her parents if she should keep it or give it up for adoption.  There are lots of families who would love to adopt a baby.<br>  <br>  Tell her no matter how scary the situation seems, there have been others in her position who did ok.  Being smart (from now on) and making wise decisions (no matter how hard they are) will keep her from a lifetime of regret.|`|a1x0xqARaa	You should lecture her.  Tell her what you want to say.  She needs to learn and hear from you that life is all about making decisions.  But at the same time, be there for her.  Suggest adoption.  They do have open adoptions, to, where she can be a part of the baby's life.  Investigate every option, WITH her.  Lecture her once, get it over with, but also be there for her every step of the way, whatever she decides.  Good luck!|`|F9pAWBG9aa	well you can do both tell her how unintelligent it is of her to be so young having unprotected sex or what ever she thinks she did to get prego and then let her know that no matter what you will be there for her. and stick to your word!|`|c0plf0VLaa	Tell her how you feel, don't be rude or harsh because she needs a friend right now. when was she supposed to have her period? If it's been over a week, do an at home test. If it comes up positive, help her approach her parents about it.|`|mTl9l3aMaa	That's disgusting. So many teens are screwing around these days. Alright, she needs a preggo test. If she tests +, and she really can't keep it, she should choose the loving option, which is adoption. And tell her to keep her legs closed.|`|ruczpWrGaa	you encourage her to talk to her parents and get to a dr.  That's the best thing for her and her unborn child.   Offer to sit with her when she tells her parents.  She will need the emotional support from you.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	Right now she needs you to be there for her but at the same time you need to explain how she could have prevented this and in case she isn't pregnant let her know that she can come to you in the future for advice or to talk to prevent this from being another scare.  <br>  <br>  She needs to take a pregnancy test.  Has she missed her period?  By how long?  If she's not missed it by a day or so yet and shes still worried I would buy one of those tests that predict up to 5 days BEFORE your missed period.  <br>  <br>  Even with me being a mom and all moms want to know whats going on with their daughters, I really don't think telling her parents would be a good idea until of course, YOU KNOW FOR SURE.  If she is pregnant that is when you could probably sit down with her parents and explain whats going on and how scared she is.  They need to know asap, even if she is scared because she needs special care right away being so young and pregnant.  It is not healthy for her or the child so she needs prenatal care!  IF she is not pregnant, depending on how her parents are...you know them better than us....you need to make the decision to tell them rather or not she's having sex.  At 14 she really needs to realize that having sex is not just a game or for fun.  Eventually you need to let her parents know what happened...and that she is sexually active.  They need to know this and adapt to this and get over it asap to help protect her later down the road from pregnancy and std's.  If you think it'd be to hard on them or they'd react in a wrong way...you COULD tell her parents of her having sex without metioning her scare of pregnancy....but if you think she's in any danger, like I said, we don't know her situation or parents, you have to make that call.  If they are great parents...and she's not in danger....I'd tell them the story after this scare is over with...if she's not pregnant.  You can't worry about making them mad at her because they have every right to be mad...and MOST OF ANY parent would be...as long as they aren't abusive or anything I'd tell them about what has happened after she finds if she's pregnant or not.<br>  <br>  Either way be there for her and get her the resources she needs to figure this out...like a home pregnancy test.  Go from there with what you should do next!<br>  <br>  If the test shows negative and she's still not had her period in a couple wks then I'd defenatly take another one...but if it shows negative then she's probably just late for her period for some very unknown reason!!!  There are many reasons to be late such as stress, change of eating habits, sickness, colds, viruses...all these things can make you late on a period.  AND, if she's not been on her period long...from the first one she had, it could be irregular for a few months to year(s).  EVeryone is different!<br>  <br>  <br>  Either way, talk to her calmly, and explain the seriousness of this but let her know you ARE there|`|6zPCQ7rPaa	what about adoption?there are so many parents who are waiting for children and want them so badly.i was adopted and so i am an advocate for adoption.it may not only save the baby but the mother being so young and all.|`|5KkcnYqcaa	Get her a pregnancy test first and if it come out positive, you need to support her because most people wont approve.<br>  I myself am 14, but if one of my friends got pregnant i would support them the best i could|`|5yAsj29Vaa	You're her cousin, not her parent.  You tell her to tell her parents or if she won't, it's up to you.  Your cousin needs to be under the care of a Dr. while she's pregnant.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	She NEEDS you to be there for her no matter how hard it might be. Try to be supportive even though she is way too young for this.|`|hJWjSWYXaa	when my cousin told me she was pregnant I was livid! I really did tell her she was stupid for getting pregnant at a young age but of coucourseat didn't help much! so I told her to make sure she's heahealthyd that she goes for her check up's and listen to the docdoctor'sell the baby is healthy  and she has a job so i guess everything is ok!|`|x6G2wPjLaa	First you need to get her a pregnancy test to be sure she is then tell the parents and decide what to do.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	Stay out of it and let adults like her PARENTS handle the situation.  And, yes you should tell her what you really think.|`|Kp2nGNwzaa	she needs you to be there for her. i do not believe in obortion either so maybe she should adopt.
hmOidFp3aa	It could be but implantation bleeding is not as common as everyone thinks it is, and when it does happen the blood is VERY pink (usually) and is only a drop or two. Just enough to slough off when the tiny egg implants! <br>  My last period was jan 30 as well but I didnt ovulate until this past saturday, my cycles are 30days long so it is way to soon to tell for me! Good luck and TONS of baby dust!|`|0e16cb05bc41bf491dee9b4dcc4fd250aa	well u have to wait till friday to find out,but u have a fairly good chance as ur timing seems to be right,good luck|`|NNwEuC8paa	It could have been!

dbd1e999d2db32deb12894e60c629053aa	My son is almost 6 months now and we are practicing all that. When he is on his belly he kicks and kicks and trys to more but nothing yet. He is strong enough to pull up but wont i have to put his hands on something then he will pull up but for some reason he wont grab it on his own. He just this week has learned to roll over which took forever! And he has been sitting up on his own just a little before 4.5 months. So I dont know when he will learn to crawl but I cant wait. I look forward to all that good stuff to come. I bet your having a blast with it!|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Oldest one was about 9 mos and younger one was pulling up at 5 mos. and walking by 7 mos.|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	My oldest started crawling right before he turned 7 months. I don't remember when he started pulling up, but he took his first steps the day he turned 9 months old. He was always driven to go go go though! My youngest is only 4 months old. He is a much more laid back personality. I don't think he will be up and moving quite as fast. He's strong enough, but I don't think he is quite as driven as his brother was.|`|lGcpXteaaa	She started crawling on the day she turned 6 months. She started pulling upa few days after that.<br>  <br>  It was weird because she didnt even roll over until a few days before that. She just caught up with everything all at once! Now at 10 months shes starting to walk :) :)|`|2585e7e86671999b1b6f36975e39adf0aa	First daughter was backwards she started pulling up at 9months but didn't crawl until she was 10 months.  My second daughter was crawling at 6 months and pulling late in her 7th month.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	crawl 6 months<br>  pulling up at 7 months|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	My son started trying at 4 months old and had it mastered by 6 months.  Started pulling up right after that, cruising by 7 months old and walking by 9 months old.  Now he is 12 months old and thinks he can run.  His body goes a little faster than his feet and falls, its funny but sad when it hurts.|`|XluHBlRPaa	My son just started crawling the other day. He is 8 months. He is ahead of a lot of babies, except for the crawling.|`|qRDHEGHJaa	Mine was 8 months for the oldest walking by 11 my girl was 9 months and my youngest wasaound 7 months and walking by 11 months
cY8DgJv5aa	In theory, you should be ovulating on or around day 14 of your cycle.  The first day of your period is counted as day 1, so I'm sure you can do the math from there.  That's assuming February 19th really was a period and not just bleeding from the 'trauma' of removing the IUD.
ibWLdXlJaa	He was sitting unassisted a 5 months, rolling at 7 months. and just recently crawling at almost 9 months. He is working on pulling himself up as we speak. Give her time. Soon she will be in everything. :)|`|308cb6bcf0531e27237a2cb393891091aa	wow....sounds like my daughter......she will not roll over , although she did it once or twice, but not all the time....<br>  <br>  but she can sit by herself and reach for her toys and not fall down, she puts her hand out to break the fall....<br>  <br>  and yes, she does try to sit up like she is doing sit ups, infact, she'll grab on to the fabric on her knees and pull it to try n sit up.....<br>  <br>  her new thing is that she wants to stand up and hold on something, but then she just falls over.....<br>  <br>  She turns 6 months this Thursday<br>  <br>  <br>  Does your daughter hate tummy time, mine does, maybe that has something to do with it....<br>  <br>  but them again, who knows, babies do things att heir own pace....|`|f7PlvV4Baa	your baby is fine, quit worrying about her rolling over.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Sounds as if she is doing just fine. Get on the floor with her and put her on her back. Put a favorite toy just out of her reach and when she starts to reach for it, help her roll a little. Don't move the toy closer, just nudge her until she gets the idea. Work on it a few times every day and before you know it, she'll get the jist of it.Each baby learns things at different times.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	About 4 months.<br>  <br>  But it sounds like your daughter is doing other things that some babies won't do for another few months! My 6 month old can't sit by herself for more than a few seconds. But she can roll over fine. It all just depends on the baby.<br>  <br>  She'll do it in her own time. As long as you give her some tummy time so there is opportunity for her to try, then you can't do much more.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Amber started to roll one way at 3.5 months and didn't figure out the other way till 5 months old<br>  <br>  All babies learn at their own rate...Amber still can't feed herself her bottle, some learn certain things faster then others<br>  <br>  Just give it time!|`|XQIbx7Plaa	My daughter began rolling over at about 5 months... And don't worry those guidelines aren't ever that accurate!  She is ten months now, and I remember worrying about her rolling over and now all she does is roll, everywhere.  She can walk now, but she never crawled, I was concerned about that as well.  The doctor says that she is perfectly fine and healthy.  You should be concerned only if she isn't doing any of those things that you listed.  It sounds as if she is doing quite well developmentally holding the bottle and sitting up.  Just keep working with her and she will eventually roll when she WANTS to!<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|1h5RpINNaa	My baby refused to roll over until she was about 5 months old.  Some kids just don't want to.  If you are concerned about talk to her dr, considering she is doing other things I think you have nothing to worry about she is just a lazy roller.  Just keep playing with her to teach her how to do it.  It'll probably happen soon.|`|VXhOLgDEaa	Hmm..I don't even remember...but I think it was around 5 mths. But let me tell you one thing first.....all babies are different. Just because your daughter isn't rolling over doesn't mean anything is wrong with her and it definitely doesn't mean she's slow. Some babies walk before they crawl some babies can talk before they can walk. It's varies dramatically....doctors and people can tell you a very broad estimate in when a baby most likely starts to do what....but most babies progress on their own pace. So don't worry~....Let her roll over when she's ready and why she wants to. Good luck!|`|VvAOuXTCaa	All babies are different. My baby turned 5 months on the 12 of this month and has yet to do a complete roll. As you said,mine can sit up and she grabs her little feet when she's laying on her back. All I know is give the baby a little more tummy time everyday & see if that might help her to build up her muscles. That's what my baby's pediatrician has told me every time I ask. No worries though. She's healthy,she will learn at her own pace =)|`|TTKJHK7qaa	if she is doing all that she is fine. My husbands 1 year old just started holding the bottle on his own because he was lazy having people do it for him all the time. Start letting her play on her stomach put toys she likes in front of her sleep on her stomach watch tv....... whatever u want....... but whats the big deal in rolling over .. so what she doesnt want to yet ... let her keep pulling herself up one day shell take up and start crawling ....|`|EhGR05Etaa	My son started at 3 months...BUT dr's and books ALWAYS stress how different babies are.  Im sure its fine..but if you are worried....if you haven't already try helping her learn.  My son started first by bringing his knees to his chest then kicking out and twisting....I'm not sure if it will help....but Im sure she will have fun playing and helping her might show her how a little better!|`|XbzgPJ9Gaa	My son was 4 and a half months, almost 5.  He decided to finally do it Christmas Eve.  -l0l-<br>  We were looking at my sisters baby book last night comparing and she didn't roll over until 6 months.|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	my son rolled over at about 4 1/2 months , dont worry all babies are different my son just started to walk before 1 yr  5 months i was worried to but hes walking now .
vtTpUCNfaa	Very! I am 30 weeks and started having my first B.H. on Christmas day. I got scared because I did that with my first pregnancy only to find out I was trying to go into pre-term labor.  This time, the doctor had me come in, checked to see if i was dialated (I wasn't) and told me it is normal to have B.H. this early but to watch for a more consistant pattern with more then 4 or 5 an hour. I only had 2 per hour and did on and off up until about 2 weeks ago. They have pretty much subsided to about 2 a day now. Remember if they become conisistant to be  little more concerned. Good luck!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	I never had B.H. contractions.  It seems normal to me.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	I've never had a full term baby. My last two I gave birth to them prematurely. Now I am 37 weeks and 1 day pregnant AND I am like: BRING IT ON CONTRACTIONS I AM FULL TERM!!! But, nope.. my daughter seems to want to sit and stew, hahahaha. I don't mind to be honest.. I want her to stay as long as she wants but, I feel you.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	braxton hicks are not something they know enough about to judge what is normal for them. they are random thats why they call them false contractions. thats all that differs them from real labor. i didnt have any until 37 wks and have only randomly had them since.|`|G32X9fnZaa	Quite natural I'm afraid.You thimk you're all set and then nothing!You don't have to go crazy but keep active and have lots of sex!

WPI0Z47saa	It is normal to get "charlie horses" in your legs at night. My Ob said to do some light stretching before bed and drink a glass of milk or eat a piece of cheese for the extra calcium before bed to help minimize them. I am 23 weeks pregnant and my legs also feel weak during the day. It is partly from carrying some extra weight and also you could be experiancing some slight swelling by that part of your pregnancy. Just try to continue being active, rest when you need to, eat calcium rich foods and drink plenty of water. Hope this helps.|`|uuHPneEcaa	mine are like that too.. I feel like i have RLS (restless leg syndrome), my doc told me he's on my spratic nerve which is makin my legs cramp up like that.<br>  <br>  and plus ur body isn't use to carrying the weight of the baby|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Likely as more time passes your legs will also feel like they weigh twice as much as well.  It's all normal and will get better after the birth|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Its called restless leg syndrome and it is the worst thing to ever happen to  be during pregnancy. My doctor said there was nothing that could be done, although it kept me up at night, and I would have to get out of the bed and stretch my legs and walk around the house until it went away. It's horrible, its like your legs never ever want to lay still. The best thing I can think to do, is when you experience it at night, get up lean against a wall and stretch your legs until they don't feel that way anymore. It worked ok for me, as soon as she was born it went away.|`|VqEJk0eiaa	Get advice from your doctor|`|W3DpQKiTaa	really not a question for this. Go to the doctor|`|y41bfvOCaa	When I was pregnant on all three I suffered with my sciatic nerve; my leg used to just give away all of a sudden and had pain all the time.

I still advise on getting it checked by your GP just to make sure. Good luck and take care,<br>  Lorraine.
Y0kMzILOaa	well firstly have you had sex? if so, then psyching yourself up to think that you are pregnant will make you more stressed and naturally make your period come later. i'd suggest you take another test and relax until you know anything for definate. good luck.|`|hmOidFp3aa	Chances are good then! Good luck and baby dust!|`|Imgb9hIWaa	well did you have sex?

xRZ1PRZwaa	* Edited<br>  <br>  Hi! It sounds like they might (underscore might!) be cafe-au-lait markings. These are similar to birthmarks, and usually not indicative of any health problem.<br>  <br>  However, numerous markings are a symptom of neurofibromatosis or McCune-Albright syndrome. My step-son has neurofibromatosis and several CALs (giraffe marks) all over his body.<br>  <br>  The pediatric dermatologist should know right off it it is neurofibromatosis (along with other testing) and can review what it means to you and your family. That said, it is nothing to worry about and is not life-threatening or a reason to panic or worry, okay?<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Good luck sweetie!<br>  <br>  p.s. if you'd like, you're welcome to e-mail me, and I can share some of our experiences with neurofibromatosis with you.

The lighter spots of hypo and depigmentation are dry with fine scales and mostly affect the face, and may easily be mistaken for vitiligo. They may occasionally appear on other parts of the body as well. These white spot on skin are more frequently seen in winter because of the dry weather, and boys are more commonly affected than the girls.<br>  The lesions usually pass through three stages.<br>  <br>  <br>  Red and raised - although the redness is often mild and not noticed by parents <br>  Pale an raised <br>  Pale, flat and smooth <br>  It is a self limiting problem but moisturizer creams can facilitate the healing process.

Ew1UGEJnaa	I recently started cutting back on breastfeeding my daughter- she doesn't nurse at all during the day now, I started gaining weight back, but was to busy to notice it until my sister in law asked if i was pregnant again! I lost so much weight after birth i ate EVERYTHING to try to keep a normal weight. If you're just about to start weaning, watch what you eat, but don't comprimise the nutrition you're giving your child. Good Luck!|`|TJ04fAgNaa	Ugh, I'm currently going through that, lol.  I have so much breastmilk stored up in the freezer that there isn't anywhere to store anymore so I've had to quit pumping for awhile.  I still do once every other day or so and will pick it back up once there is room in the freezer, but I've gained some weight since I've cut back so much.  It sucks, but I think I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and watch what I eat again...|`|68d8ad07f5b8eb2e788d4d05c809eeeaaa	yes, I gained 10 lbs back after I stop breastfeed.
8052a63d386f57a5453412aecd1de123aa	Is this your 1st, 2nd, how many pregs. is this?  Most likely like the other writers said, Braxton Hicks, However, if they start getting real intense, hard and fast, go to the ER. I'm thinking its just pre-labor Braxtons.  If they get to where you feel nauseous, call your Dr. and Good luck!  Congratulations!  Hope it's healthy!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Most likely just braxton hicks. Try laying down for awhile and they should go away.

GEfpzUNvaa	you should be ok for now.. jsut be more careful.. there are so many women out there that don't know they are pregnant and are still going out on the town drinking... i was 12 weeks with my first before i knew i was pregnant i was young and stupid and had no clue of anything.. drinking and all.. and she is 8 years old and healthy as can be now.. good luck and baby dust to you...|`|SHBpzAIZaa	I think that if you are pregnant, you will be ok this time...

433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Have sex in the morning, or between 5 and 7pm as it's proven sperm is at it's highest quality at those times.. Have sex every other day at least. There's no such thing as too much. Get your partner to ditch his tight undies and go for boxer shorts, as this will keep his testes at the right temperature, and prevent over heating. Get him to cut down use of his laptop for the same reason. Take folic acid, cut down caffeine, cut down alcohol consumption, quit smoking.  Have sex in the missionary or doggy positions to pool the sperm closer to the cervix, woman on top is a bad idea as it pools the sperm behind the cervix which defeats the object. If you have sex missionary, stick a pillow under your hips to align yourself better with your partner. It means your sperm have a direct route, and less work to do to reach the egg. Don't let your partner withdraw too quickly from you, and lie there for about 15 minutes to ensure ample time for those little swimmers to reach the desired destination.. Raising the legs against a wall, or just bending the knees can also aid this quicker.. Naturally charting your most fertile days with an ovulation kit is a bigger help. l hope this is of some use!|`|ce8COixxaa	An easy thing to do is to make sure you are on the bottom when BDing, and lay there for a bit with your hips elevated, just to give the little swimmers a chance to get where they need to go! Cut out things now that would be harmful to the baby, like alcohol and smoking, and even caffeine. Make sure you have sex often, esp. around your fertile times. Good luck! Lost of Baby Dust to everyone!!!|`|oiJITSNZaa	Nothing works for the same person! it all has to do with your makeup, hormones and partner!
yH39NEXSaa	Wow! I'm 6 days late too. :) I am testing tomorrow morning and hoping for a positive.<br>  <br>  The chances of a boy or girl is always 50/50.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm not sure about the gender question but if you are 6 days late then chances are you're pregnant. Good luck and baby dust!|`|kTu7UtS1aa	1. It sounds as if you are pregnant since your periods is so far over due.<br>  (Good luck with that!)<br>  <br>  2. This is not EXACT science, I am only repeating things that I have read/heard:  Apparently, if you have sex days leading up to ovulation, then there is a higher chance of conceiving a girl since X sperm (girl) survive longer in the cervical environment and are slower than the Y sperm (this means that they can wait around for the egg to be released).  On the other hand, the Y sperm (boy), are faster and smaller, but they do not live as long.  If you have sex before you ovulate, they would have died off by the time your egg is released.   So, by having sex on the day that you ovulate, then you have increased your chances of having a boy.  <br>  Once again, this is not an exact science, I am not a doctor/nurse, I just like to read a lot.   I hope this helped!  Good luck to you!!!!|`|yea2hci5aa	You can def. buy a hpt at this point and if that shows up a bfn then take another one a week from now if af hasn't shown.  If you want more accurate results then I suggest calling your doctor for a blood test.  <br>  <br>  The only way to know if you're going to have a boy or girl is if you are pregnant and you get a sonogram around the 4th or 5th month into your pregnancy.  Other than that there's absolutely no way for anyone to tell you.  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|oiJITSNZaa	you asked very impossible to answer questions! You most likely ovulate around day 14 so it is unlikely that anything happend. A boy or girl? Get educated there's no way to determine!!!!LOL
HEdGGmkhaa	I am in the same boat but I am 14 dpo, I am terrified of being disappointed again.... the only advice I can give you is to do it when you feel ready, if you are late then you should really do one soon. I would get hubby or a close friend for support and do it together. I always just had a feeling I was pregnant when I was going to take mine, like I already knew what it was going to say but I was nervous anyways lol.<br>  <br>  I hope you are pregnant, I hope I am too but I don't have that feeling so I am not getting my hopes up :o)<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you are but everyone could say that as your symptoms are spot on....Good luck!|`|YLXpwqceaa	I think you just might be...you stopped stressing! <br>  <br>  But I would take a test, and if it is negative, retake it is 3 days!<br>  <br>  My positive on my first child didn't show up til 19dpo so don't get discouraged if it is no...your body may not show the hormone til later like mine.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun with lots of Baby Dust!!!|`|kTu7UtS1aa	I'd say go for it!  I know exactly how you feel!  I take a test a week after I ovulate and I know full well that it's too early. I just have to get it out of the way.  (We are still trying for our first.)  Take it now; if you get a BFP, then we can all celebrate with you.  If not, then we'll all be waiting with you.  <br>  Good luck to you!!!|`|14RzmDTmaa	it sounds like yu could be, i would go buy a two pack test and test just in case.|`|f066bc63dc201d9ff49cf81de2f92a07aa	go do the test now we're with ya xx|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Wait another 3 days, and test then - if you are pregnant it will absolutely be positive then.|`|TljXiSNnaa	soundsa like ago to me!!! i would just wait still another few days. i waited until exactly 7 days after my missed period to see and im glad i did the cus now im 4 months preggers with number 1...good luck and lots of babydust to you

JLayHNZCaa	Why would you do it?  It has been proven that there are no benefits, as long as he is taught to clean himself properly.  A bad job can take a lot of pleasure from him.  It is not necessary and really should be outlawed in the world.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	For us there was no thinking about it. We both agreed that it is what we wanted to do. Of course I felt bad because who *likes* having it done but we strongly felt that was what was in his best interest.<br>  <br>  Bring on the thumbs down. I know touchy subject...|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	My son is circumsised. My fiance and I talked about it before we had him and agreed that we want it done. It is the norm here in NY and we just felt that it was the right decision to make. They did it the day after he was born. They wheeled him out, 5 minutes later he was wheeled back in and he was not crying or upset. I am glad we choose this for our son and I have no regrets.|`|K1UicE7kaa	You will usually find some controversy on this issue as people become passionate to defend "their choice" as the "right choice".  There are many variables that effect the choices. I have been in health care for many years and have heard them all. It is probably one of the first choices (after naming a male baby) that some find to be agonizing.  <br>  <br>  There probably isn't a wrong choice... but, there is a "better choice"... depending what weight you give all the variables and what the sum total is.  For some people it becomes a close call and that makes it a hard to decide.  The more people you ask the more difficult it can be to decide sometimes.  The variables will become exploited.  <br>  <br>  I will not raise all the crazy arguments in all directions and spare you that.  I will give you my opinion from years of clinical/professional career and personal (self and as a father of a son).  I would find a competent doctor to do the procedure... and make sure it is not a resident learning how to do it.  (On the side... "quietly ask" the nursery nurse who would be a best choice ---they are not suppose to say--so don't make an issue about it).  It is not rocket science... but if you have an opportunity to steer that... that is more of where to put your interest.  Sometimes there are group practices and out of the group one doctor is really slick at it. <br>  Good Luck!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I have 3 boys and about to have my 4th.  It was a no brainer for me.  I am not Jewish, but the reasoning for me is that it was a way in the Bible for men to show that their hearts were set apart for God.  Our family is a strongly faith based and God loving family, and it was as important to us as dedicating our sons to God.  It is, however,  important to wait for the 8th day as that is when the sensitivity level is at it's lowest and after that it begins to rise again.<br>  Other than reasons of faith, there really is no other reason for circ.  There are no proven health benefits ( I also just think it looks better)|`|oojO4WAraa	I had my son circumcised.  It was a no-brainer decision.  I had no problem with that decision.|`|Q7jMH5praa	My husband and I talked about circumcision and decided that it was best for our son. I don't "feel" bad for making that decision and neither does my husband. <br>  <br>  One of the deciding factors was my husband's grandfather suffered from penile cancer, and was told by his doctor that if he had been circumcised his chances of developing the cancer would have been lower. My husband's mother circumcised him because of that and we took that into consideration when deciding if we want to have our son circumcised.|`|m9eSPvdfaa	I have three boys. All are circumsized. It didn't effect me much to have it done. I didn't watch and I know they won't remember it. However, their dad teared up for each one of them after they had it done. I think in the long run it's better for them. I had a bf once that wasn't circumsized and he seemed to have trbl keeping it clean. It was gross|`|fBGq6BL6aa	From what my mom told me (I don't have any kids) she wasn't going to get any of her kids circumcised until she read that uncircumcised penises are more prone to infection if not cleaned properly. <br>  <br>  Although my brother did have a horror story when his son got circumcised and the doctor cut a little too deep the day before he got brought home. They spent the night in the ER but no one wanted to put a stitch in it because they weren't sure if it would affect him later in life. They ended up putting some kind of bandaid thing on it and it's now 5 years later and he's fine. The doctor did say it was rare that ever happens but it does happen obviously.|`|uJnvFKyLaa	My little man has just turned one year, we did not circumsize and I am so glad that we didn't. My baby was content and peaceful when we brought him home, I didn't have to deal with cleaning that horrible looking wound that it leaves (and yes it's a wound, I've seen it in person) He just turned a year in Jan. We have no problems whatsoever and I am so proud of our decision. I really didn't feel so strongly about it at his birth but if you think about it, femal circumsizion is considered mutilation so why is it different to chop off parts on a boy?|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I had my son circumcised, it didn't really make me "feel" anything. It was what my husband and I decided was best, just as some families decide not circumcising is best. Don't listen to what anyone else says-No one has a right to judge your child's genitals or your choice!|`|ufItSQsZaa	I think you should circumcise you boy only if you are a jew or Muslim><br>  Jews do it when the child is 7 days old, and some Muslim do it when the boy is 13 Years old.<br>  Good luck !|`|OTiLeig8aa	I had my son circumsized.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend left the decision to me as I am a guy and his father.|`|hw8jOWaeaa	of course i had my son circumsized- why wouldnt you. their so young that they never remember it.|`|0CSkCCnraa	I didn't get my son circumcised 8 years ago, nor did i do it to the one I had 5 weeks ago. No problems on either front. I couldn't do it. When the pediatrician came in and asked in the hospital I told him no, I couldn't do it. It would just hurt my heart too much, and he said "good. I have three boys and none of them are" I have never known a doc to be that way. Also after he left, the nurse said that she thought our decision was great and that if she ever had a son she wasn't going to get him one because she has seen so many botched jobs done at the hospital and it scared her.<br>  Do what you feel is best, but don't let anyone pressure you to do something you feel isn't right.  DO your research. That's what I did. A great book to read is "What your Doctor won't tell you about circumcision. It is really good, and it sites a lot of credible studies and references.|`|jPLiMCPDaa	We had my son circumsized when he was born.<br>  <br>  It was a little hard to watch, but I know that moment of discomfort is offset over his lifetime with benefits.

miPubuDYaa	Anthing is possible. However twins usually run on the mothers side. Especial faternal twins like yourr dad and aunt.<br>  <br>  What happens in faternal twins is the mom releashes two eggs that month. If the mom does that there is 50% chance her daughter will too. <br>  <br>  What happens with identical twins is the single egg splits into to identical cells. Thats had nothing to do with genes, Just a fluke of nature|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Since fraternal twins is a genetic trait, you are slightly more likely then the average person to have double ovulation during one cycle and getting pregnant with twins.   But, it would be more true if you were older and you had more then just one set of twins in your genetic heritage.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Not anymore likely then the rest of the population.  Twins are only hereditary on the maternal side.|`|AA10624857	There is no genetic connection with identical twins, but fraternal twins do have a small genetic link.  The release of more than one egg during ovulation can have a genetic reason called hyper-ovulation.  The increase of the chance of twins if there are twins on the mother's side of them family is quite small, but it is slightly more than the general population.  Here is a web site that helps you determine your chance of having twins <a href="http://www.twinstuff.com/twinchances.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.twinstuff.com/twinchances.htm...</a>  Here's another site with a quiz to take to show your chances <a href="http://multiples.about.com/library/signsquiz/bltwinsignsquiz.htm" rel="nofollow">http://multiples.about.com/library/signs...</a>|`|5BkN4r2Paa	I think it skips a generation, but there is always a chance.

If he gives you any crap, get up and leave, because he's not worth it.<br>  <br>  Also, yes, you can get pregnant any time his penis enters your vagina, with or without protection.  However, protection will help your chances of not getting pregnant.  I would suggest using a condom and having him withdraw his penis from your vagina before ejaculation.

Your young but it sounds like you have at least thought about it a bit and want to do it with someone you trust. Everyone's vagina looks different so don't worry bout that. He might be worried bout what you think of his genitals too, it's natural to think like that but i'm sure your both completely normal.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	You need to mature abit more, and also if you were ready, you would know it so i personally think you should hang on. <br>  and yes you can get pregnant the first time you have sex, thats why you need to remember to take a spare condom if you do deside to have sex with him.|`|hnICmxMoaa	"OH AND I WANNA KNOW CAN I GET PREGIES WHEN I DO IT THE FIRST TIME??"<br>  *smacks forehead* if you don't know the answer to this question then it's not your business having sex<br>  I'm not gonna comment about your young age..but please before doing anything sexual..just read on the internet -_-<br>  <a href="http://www.positive.org/JustSayYes/safesex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.positive.org/JustSayYes/safes...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.seventeen.com/health-sex-fitness/special/prevent-teen-pregnancy-0108" rel="nofollow">http://www.seventeen.com/health-sex-fitn...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.avert.org/usecond.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avert.org/usecond.htm</a><br>  here..read up before doing anything hasty<br>  <br>  Amber don't tell the kid she can get pregnant only once a month...what the? before you answer check your data..she can get pregnant AT ANY TIME of the month..heck some even when they're on their period..rare but...-_-|`|BUOJJpaCaa	There is no law saying you get pregnant the first time you have sex. You can get pregnant anytime you have sex.<br>  <br>  If you want to know what your vagina looks like, take a handheld mirror and reflect the image back up.<br>  <br>  If you really want to have sex, go ahead. Be safe. Use condoms. Get on birth control :)|`|T1T4vIZoaa	Sure, go for it! It's better when you have sex with someone you're comfortable with, you'll enjoy it a lot more! Yes, you can get pregnant the first time you have sex so make sure you're on BC and use condoms! Don't worry about your vagina. It's not like he'll be staring at it lol!|`|82f0c556b0d2ce6d669d0c2cc03b3438aa	It's entirely up to you to decide when you have sex and who it's with. But yes, you can get pregnant your first time, so use protection.|`|RQ7utEMBaa	You most certainly can get pregnant. You should be able to share intimacy without actually having the sex. Why don't you wait a few years. you will always be able to do it later.|`|AkpMTWHgaa	well it depends on w you feel about  him and YES you can get pregnant on your 1st time.|`|QImt8GtSaa	yes. **** his brains out. youll be fine. i promise.|`|AusPef8Yaa	You say you're ready, but you don't know if you can get pregnant the first time? HA! Priceless..|`|mViaFhVVaa	if you have to ask should you, you shouldn't!<br>  xx|`|c99aa0d7f7f9c98be09c0cdfc426b916aa	You DEFINITELY don't sound like you're ready for this.....|`|QO5p0kTXaa	Give it time you're only 15 and don't sound ready.|`|JFbWyKKDaa	You can get pregnant... even the first time...I'd wait. A month isn't long, hun. Wait a year and then see how you feel about him.  I lost my virginity at your age and I'm 19 now with a child ( I had him at 18). I regret it and wished I would have waited.  There's so much other stuff you could do! Why are you trying do adult things when your still a kid? Enjoy your childhood... it doesn't last forever. I still miss mine- that's for sure. Before you know it you'll be paying taxes, so don't rush the sex. Having sex doesn't make you an adult, but it could make you a baby!  High school is hard to finish taking care of a child at the same time, but I did it!
c0plf0VLaa	First of all, a pregnancy test won't be reliable until it's been over a week since your missed period.  Second, since being off of BC in the past 4 weeks, have you had unprotected sex? After coming off of BC, esp after being on it for so long, you're extremely fertile for 3-6 mo while your body readjusts back to how it used to be.  Good luck!|`|gCBqdHf2aa	It takes a couple months for your period to get back on track after getting off birth control. It took me 10 months for my period to be regular again and then two months later I was prego.
AA10313527	its not really a pregnancy sign....Its probably just early period symptom...Don't freak 2 much or u can delay ur period more and freak out even more....The more u stress out about this the longer it might take to ur period...i was 2 weeks late once because i thought i was pregnant...my advice 2 you wait a couple days since 2day is the day you get ur period and if u havent got ur period take a pregnancy test...|`|NNwEuC8paa	You could be pregnant or you could just be gassy! Wait a few days for your period and if she doesn't come then take a test. Sometimes your period can just switch its cycle, its no big deal it happened to me and i was worried sick and it turned out to be nothing just getting older. By the way I'm only 20. but thats around the time that cycle just change. Good luck hun|`|bo4MguzVaa	you could just be gassy.  <br>  <br>  Not enough symptoms, or time to say one way or another.<br>  <br>  But intuition is a good indicator...at least it was for me.<br>  <br>  I thought i was pregnant, and when i bought a test (even though my period was only a day late) and it came back positive.  <br>  <br>  Give it a little time, if you dont get your period in 7 days, take a test.|`|f0dnVAW7aa	It's hard to base whether or not you are pregnant with gas.<br>  <br>  Are your boobs tender, achy back, morning sickness?<br>  <br>  How long as it been since the last time you had sex? Is it too earlier for you to take a test? <br>  <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!|`|07i0Xyevaa	well unless ur under some stress. Id get a Home preg test and if it says neg and ur still alte for ur period then go to the docs and get blood work good luck
ZDC81VjZaa	Early Response is a great pregnancy test for earliest detection though if you used protection correctly, this might not be your issue.<br>  <br>  There has been a bad bout of the flu going around and it IS possible that she may be experiencing a bit of that.  <br>  <br>  Morning sickness doesn't just happen overnight, generally and if your as concerned about it as you seem... there's a morning after pill but I think it's already too late for her to take that.  <br>  <br>  If you discover that she ISN'T pregnant... remember how this felt and do everything in your power to prevent this from happening again.  She could be nauseous as she'd just given up something priceless... her virginity.  <br>  <br>  Quite a bit to consider though I hope the most obvious is the least of your worries.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	if you used "protection" correctly then you guys should be fine.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	the flu has been going around... and if u didnt *** and u used protection I highly doubt she is pregnant.... just sick... plus signs like that dont start until like 5-7 weeks pregnant|`|1thzSbS8aa	There are NO PREGNANCY SYMPTOMS the day after, or two days after, or three days after, or four days after sex. No one is even pregnant at all that soon, it can take almost two weeks for pregnancy to establish at all.<br>  <br>  If she felt sick the next day, it is either from stress, guilt, fear, or a genuine stomach ailment. Not from a baby. It doesn't sound likely that you could have impregnanted her under those circumstances anyway.|`|WI5KmVRdaa	i don't think shes pregnant if you didn't *** and you used protection but to make sure get a pregnancy test and the reason she might be getting sick is that it was her first time and that puts allot of stress on someone|`|OIS808Qmaa	She wouldn't get sick from pregnancy until about 3 weeks after she got pregnant.  She might just be sick, but if you really think something is not right, wait until she misses her period and then take a test.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	shes fine if she was a virgin this might have upset her body.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	wait and few more weeks if she misses her period then take the test, depending on you age and responsibility then if she is you have to consider if you want to keep it or not, she is probably just got the sickness bug or something because its abit to early for morning sickness.<br>  <br>                            good luck x|`|GiEyfW4Qaa	Yeah, well she feels much worse ut yourself in her situation shes the one carring it. Just please be sportive.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Fashionista|`|T1T4vIZoaa	Buy a pregnancy test.
ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	He doesn't want to be a fatehr to these children. He simply donated sperm. Biologically, he's a father, but it takes more than that to be a real "dad."<br>  <br>  As far as the state taking them, they would only be inclined to intervene if it is proven that she is neglectful and not fit to care for them. I imagine that that is the truth. Who could manage to care for 14 kids under the age of 8 by themselves? And the general consensus is that no one wants to donate any money to her. I'm just glad I'm not a California tax payer or I'd be pissed! They're the ones who will be paying for these kids, all 14 of 'em, for the next 18 years.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Sperm donors have no legal rights. If we did it in this case it would open up a can of worms in court for other cases. No thanks.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	any man who donated his sperm annonymously doesnt want to be found or be a dad. otherwise he would have just had children with someone. this is a silly question|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	So,you think it's okay for a guy who knowingly donated sperm to a woman who wanted to have boatloads of kids..is a more fit parent?<br>  <br>  Where's your logic? Who's to say any one person could take care of all of these children. Not a chance honey. This is going to take an army!|`|zwJbUbWMaa	They know who the father is.  He is an acquaintance of theirs.  He doesn't want the babies and is currently out of the country.  That just isn't an option.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	Is that to say he should get ALL the kids since it was the same sperm donor for all 14 of them? I think not. The whole situation is just wrong.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	I've read that the father is a foreign national who has no interest in the babies.  He is the father of all her children.<br>  He is a sperm donor, not a father in any but the biological sense.<br>  <br>  A man was interviewed this morning who says hes the father, hes married.  The mother says this isn't the father.<br>  I have a feeling we will be seeing more 'fathers' come out of the woodwork, remember when Anna Nicole died, I think we will be seeing the same thing,  I tend to think they would all be in it for the money, fame and attention.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	he is found, and he knows about the babies. He wasn't random he was a friend of hers, who donated just for her. She said he might be apart of their life later on but not right now.|`|AA11215737	It's donated sperm.  He has no right to the babies in any way.  He's not even allowed to see the kids if the mother doesn't permit it.|`|OpVysSzQaa	who says the father is any better than she is. if he cared about raising his children, he wouldn't have sold them to a bank.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	They doctor is at fault he should of never done the produce lets leave it at that.
hmOidFp3aa	My guess is becuase you were reading about it! If you gave me how long your cycle days were and stuff like that I could help you decide when you take a preggo test! Good luck and TONS of baby dust!|`|NNwEuC8paa	ahh! I've had this some many times and it never meant anything for me but they were the best dreams ever!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	IT IS A DREAM!!  If you think you could be pregnant then take a test...we are not fortune tellers.|`|9WKVmOs1aa	from what i am sensing, you might want to go grab a REAL pregnancy test. most dreams like that are trying to tell you something. maybe its just trying to tell you that you should use a condom next time you have sex. dreams can just be a warning signal, or they can also be a sign that maybe you really are pregnant. just get a test to be sure. it won't hurt.|`|GSeKuBkYaa	female u iz bout dumb az hell DUH U PREGNAT
CE3bmj65aa	Okay, is the baby alright.  If he seems okay and has stopped crying and is responsive he should be fine.  If he keeps crying or seems lethargic take him to the ER.|`|X6as2nOAaa	IS he/she ok? How did they land? Do you need to take the baby to a doc? I don't think the bouncy seat is very far from the ground maybe the baby needs to be watched more carefully?|`|JFbWyKKDaa	STRAP THEM IN...EVERY TIME... duh... That's what the seat belt is there for... I think your baby will be okay, but you should get him checked out at the doctor if he acts weird or doesn't respond to you.
3xuJI78Zaa	Boy one. But i just don't trust the flirty boys. & Driving all the way to bring you your favorite ice cream is pretty sweet! Haha.|`|QLe4U0baaa	dint go out with either<br>  believe me you wont end up happy<br>  i was in the same situation with two guys just like them<br>  i went with boy 2 and my friend had boy 1<br>  its been 3 mouths now ans me and him still don't talk and he hasn't got the balls to talk to me<br>  <br>  my friend leaft boy 1 after just a week because he was frigid and needy|`|i3pn4jNcaa	pick the one you havent done anything with yet|`|qv493CGiaa	Boy 2 :)|`|T1T4vIZoaa	Boy 2.|`|3oswni4Vaa	Pick the one who you like. not the one who likes you the most or whatever. If you go out with boy 2, there's a chance he won't be as flirty and if you go out with boy 1, there's a chance it won't work/won't be the same if you've dated before (im speaking from past experience - i dated a boy, we broke up then got back together but it wasn't the same)<br>  Personally, i would pick boy 2, but that's only because don't date people ive dated before. They both sound like really good guys though :-)<br>  and yes i know this 'advice' has probably not been the most helpful|`|RXeuiz95aa	boy 1.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't trust the flirty one.
1ezYfkX7aa	They will do your weight, blood pressure, take a urine sample....breast exam, pap smear, some may do an u/s or schedule you for one, give you and estimated due date, write you a script for prenatal vitamins, give you papers to get lab work done and answer any questions you may have =)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	A urine test (they reconfirm you're pregnancy), a pap smear (checking for a tubal pregnancy and also for STD's like chlamydia).  I'd expect quite of paperwork to fill out so go about 15 minutes early.  They do regular check up stuff like weight and blood pressure.  You may get your first ultrasound...maybe...if so they're checking the babies heartbeat and can tell you more about your approx due date.  Congrats to you!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	you should expect a bag of prenatal pills (if your lucky), some books and a lot of people saying congrats lol
ZbnxGIsnaa	I would say to take a pregnancy test about March 1st.  =)  I was very fertile around the same time you were and that means you would be a few days late by the 1st and would be a perfect time to test.  Good luck!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I would take a test between the 28th and 30th.|`|mhhwuLsRaa	hi lady bug<br>  <br>  if you ovulated on 14th of feb you are currently 9DPO (days past ovulation) and your period normally comes round 14DPO so id wait another week or so to make sure you get accurate results<br>  <br>  baby dust
tn3CCytmaa	Well<br>  <br>  I think you  are pregnant . Take a home pregnancy test and you will be sure .|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't know what to say - you could be pregnant. You can't get symptoms straight after sex (you're not even pregnant then) but if you've been doing it all month you could have conceived early on, or since your last period anyway (unless it was lighter than usual or strange somehow).<br>  <br>  About your period I have no idea it sounds pretty irregular. Take a pregnancy test now then wait for your next period and take one if it doesn't come in about 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Oh, and use condoms!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|i2MAFIC0aa	Hm. So is your question when you should expect your period, or if there is any way to have symptoms of being pregnant after having sex?<br>  <br>  Ok, first of all, yes. There are ways of having symptoms of being pregnant after you've had sex. The biggest way is if you're now pregnant. You're also going to be moody and generally unbearable to be around for the 9 months the symptoms last. Then your body will excrete a small mammilian symbiote. You should be pretty good after that, with the exception of swollen breasts for a few months, pancake breasts after that, and a general loss of will to be attractive or have fun.<br>  <br>  If you're not pregnant, it could be any number of reasons. You could just be hormonal and young. You could also be getting old and hormonal. Either way, if you're not pregnant, it'd probably be a good idea to get your tubes tied. You're asking questions on YahooAnswers that should be directed to a doctor at Planned Parenthood.|`|834f944311fcb27187f4084a34c49d38aa	Dont risk getting pregnant if your not ready for it, always use protection. your breast could be sore either coz your period is almost or you could be pregnant.. when your periods will show up depends, is it regular or iregular? anyways if i was you i wouldnt worry, untill am like a month and a half late........................
OiFNZnwOaa	those symtoms usually occur around 6wks pregnant, at 3wks its not very likely....but that does not mean you are not pregnant wait till you miss your period and take a test...its too soon now to get an acurate result/...|`|s1BaLV1Laa	To early  to have pregnancy symptoms, 1st pregnancy symptom is missed period. at this stage you can do HPT.|`|z9IPEsFsaa	i believe just take a test or go to the doctor..
331444a2b76e68eeff0a4ce275773130aa	Actually, it's not a part of a baby's wee body that gets to me.  It's the glorious smell!  There is nothing better in this world than the delightful, totally emotionally engaging smell of a baby prior to the introduction of solid foods.<br>  <br>  Got my baby-smell fix last night at a Wiccaning.  Mmmmm, so beautiful!|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	That adorable little tummy...so soft...so chunky :) perfect for kisses and raspberries. I can't look at a baby's tummy and not smile. <br>  <br>  A close second: wherever little rolls or "segments" are- creases in the arms and legs. So...stinking...cute!|`|J6IOqzL0aa	aw that's such a hard question because there are too many places but i think i will have to go with his superly soft neck that smells Divine. I like to snuggle in to it and give it a big kiss.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I love every little thing about my twins but I love their smiles most of all.  Each morning when I walk their room their smiles just brighten up my day.|`|AA12145826	Probably my daughter's belly. Once she discovered it (after mommy blew about a thousand raspberries on it!) she would suck it in and then push it out for hours on end....so cute!!|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I don't have a favorite part with my baby.. I would say his face if I had to choose..

I think it's so freaking cute when I undress her to give her a bath and she's clinging to me in a frog position on my chest her little butt is just so darn cute!! hahaha even though it produces some pretty foul smelling stuff.. ohhhh my! haha|`|T0gv52CDaa	That varies by baby.  With my 3 month old, it is definitely his cheeks.  I always threaten to bite them because they are so cute & chunky.  With my 2 1/2 year old, it was his belly.|`|4pXQxKMbaa	I couldn't pick one part! I just love to look at her little face, though! I LOVE that she is the perfect combination of my husband and me!|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Her smile! It's so adorable; especially right after she wakes up, cause she smiles HUGE! Or, she has little sweet grins, when I cuddle her close. :)|`|xwOwsZvEaa	BUM i just want to eat it(when its clean) when he has just come out of the bath smelling lovely nice and warm oooooowwww lovely little cheeks|`|uLdeIhHqaa	I would say her legs! She has such pretty legs to be a baby! Im jealous! :) But, its really hard to pick one thing because to me...Shes perfect in every way!|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I love my daughters chubby toes and I love kissing her chubby neck. She is very ticklish on her neck so she giggles every time I kiss it or blow on it lol.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Im with you. His chubby legs are so cute. For our girl though id have to say her smile.

He has his mama's chubby cheeks, lol|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Hmm...they're all equally wonderful but I'd have to say my daughter's little tushy. She's SOOO petite but still manages to have a cute squishy little butt, and when she runs around naked after a bath my husband and I make a little sound effects as she runs by, like "ptt ptt ptt!" LOL|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I love their chubby little arms.  They are so tiny, but fat, so it looks like they are muscular.

I also nurse while tidying up sometimes as well. I have also mastered cloth nappies! I could never do that before lol. But I must say, putting a nappy on when the child is standing up is rather cool hehe.|`|lzivF4Idaa	nursing while showering? how do you do that?|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Since I had children I had officially and proudly say that I have mastered multi-tasking. Showering, cooking, dressing, talking on the phone and keeping them quiet, homework and tea time(Jasper's got spelling work but Mya wants attention), my god the list goes on. lol<br>  I can diaper my children standing up...not anymore cause they are older but that was something I figured out real fast--ya know those times when you just cant lay them down. :)|`|RQfLKOPQaa	I've had to learn everything, from feeding, holding, patting the back and wait for a burp, change the diaper. I'm not as good as my wife, but I get things done, and I have no problem in taking care of our daughter by myself, when my wife has something to do.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Yep, I've mastered all those too, plus loading and unloading a dishwasher and washer/dryer with one hand while holding baby and making a bed and showering my 4 and 5 year old and homeschooling the older ones all while holding my baby and being in the third trimester with the next.|`|LqimEAfWaa	No children of my own yet, but I do have neices and nephews, as well as babysat for almost a year.  Here is what I have learned thanks to that experience:<br>  <br>  1.  How to diaper a standing baby.<br>  2.  How to diaper a baby in a public restroom that doesn't have a changing table.<br>  3.  How to keep a toddler from climbing over the gate that is blocking the stairs.<br>  4.  Keeping a 1 yr. old from playing in the toilet.<br>  5.  How to get a picky 7 yr. old to try new foods.  (And a picky 26 yr. old for that matter. LOL!)<br>  6.  The lid to a sippy cup is NOT toddler proof!  (Esp. the ones that just snap on and don't twist on.)<br>  7.

(Popsicles as a bribe work wonders!)<br>  <br>  <br>  These are just a few things I have learned in my experiences with small children.  There are more, but I think I've rambled on enough for now.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	LOL, cute question.<br>  I can change a diaper in any position.  I mastered that one when my oldest was around 15 months old.<br>  I have people (family) ask me all the time how I do it.  One word... Practice!  When you have an active toddler who won't stay still and needs a diaper, you have to find a way, lol.
s4LWmcTjaa	I think they should tried as adults with the mental capacity of a child and be given capital punishment, lol ;-)<br>  <br>  I know you and I don't see eye to eye on that particular issue.  That's ok.  I respect your point of view.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But in all seriousness?  I think rehab for life.  Trollism is a condition that is not understood.  Do you suppose these people lived under bridges their entire lives?|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Take away their computer. Put them in intensive rehab. After that mandatory support groups meetings. Lol can you imagine those? Film it all and put it on as a reality TV show.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I take it you are also aware that the "tried as children or as adults" question was asked this morning by our troll with her "Real" ID?  Or, was that just coincidence??    <br>  <br>  Anyhow, there is not much hope.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I think he/she should have to live one week in my shoes.  Just get an idea of what my life is like.  While I sit back on my big butt and watch them struggle.|`|AA11210211	I'm not sure most things can be rehabilitated though so it's possible...A cookie might work??|`|j2mRop0laa	Deranged with no chance to be saved!

I think they should be tried as children. They act like children so they should be treated like children.  They're offenses aren't that bad either.  Their verbal abuse isn't even that clever.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I came across this question and it made me laugh, I need that right now!<br>  <br>  Trolls should be tried as children if they are children... and adults if they are adults.. as should all other people. <br>  <br>  If you plan on asking any more funny questions, or questions that will make me think about other things... please add me to your contacts.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	lol<br>  it must be a kick we are all on in here.  you are somewhat more obvious than myself.<br>  <br>  but for trolls - yes there is hope.  they just have to want to be reached. <br>  they need to just listen to me, i am the voice of reason afterall<br>  the sentence is they MUST answer "am i pregnant" questions in pregnancy.  and they MUST be genuine.|`|AA12145826	Trolls should be tried as adults acting like children. Doubt they can be rehabilitated, there is no mental illness called "immaturity" and unfortunately no services available to help rid them of it. Perhaps forcing them to get a life would help deter their abhorrent behavior|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Adults.<br>  No.<br>  Yes.<br>  Reality.|`|v0BvbOOSaa	They act immature so they should be treated like children. I'd take away their computer time. No more computer for you boy! Now go sit in the corner!|`|rNvXWMOMaa	they should be treated like a child<br>  and be put across someones knee<br>  for a well deserved spanking.|`|0QYIbn1saa	It depends on the troll....<br>  <br>  Most should be tried as adults because they are, however I'm sure their attorneys would argue otherwise.<br>  <br>  Mentally ill?   Yes.  They have issues of severe insecurity, lonliness, depression, anger, and delusions of grandeur.  I'm not sure they can be "fixed", however.

I get home about 4:40.  We head straight upstairs and start playing :)  Usually start making dinner around 6.  Then we eat, bath time, and things start winding down around 8 and he's usually out by 8:30 at the latest.  I stay up until around 10, just relaxing and catching up on my reality tv fix, LOL|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I leave work to pick up the kids from school, they get a snack and some downtime while I look through backpacks and usually unload the dishwasher or fold a load of laundry.  Then we start afternoon activities (piano, guitar, TaeKwonDo etc).  We also do homework, and I'll supervise that.  Sometime in there we squeeze in dinner and I might have a glass of wine (as long as all my driving is over with).  Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays are bath night for the kids and then we wind down by reading together or all piling in our bed to watch cartoons for a little bit.  Sometimes we watch "how it's made" instead.  When the kids are in bed I either watch tv with hubby, read a book or compute.|`|oP504BtFaa	I usually only have three meetings a day, sometimes more when it's a busier season, so I'm home throughout the day cleaning and such. Like now, I just finished my fourth meeting and am home. I'll be picking up Celia and Emily from dance lessons in an hour, driving Allison to lacrosse conditioning right before then, and I'm helping Megan with her homework right now, but driving her to a private sax lesson later. I'll start dinner when Celia and Emily are home, probably pulled pork sandwiches, and my husband will pick up Allison on his way home from work. We'll eat together, then I get out of kitchen duty while I drive Megan to her lesson, when I come home I'll probably come on here and help my girls with homework. On Mondays I watch Jon and Kate Plus Eight.<br>  <br>  My days are usually driving my girls to their activities and cooking. And Y!A!|`|dDVAUA9saa	I make dinner (usually mostly prepared the night before) while my daughter either plays in the kitchen with me or eats a snack at the table.  We eat together (Dad doesn't get home until 6 or later), then she "helps" me clean up.  Then we play for a while or have a bath (I only bath her every second night).  After her bath, we read stories for 20-30 minutes before bedtime.  <br>  <br>  After she goes to bed, I make my lunch, prep dinner for the next night, do laundry, etc.  Then collapse on the couch before going to bed.|`|AA12145826	Typically my post-work time looks like this:<br>  <br>  5pm - Leave work<br>  5:15pm - Pick up hubby & head home<br>  6:15 - 6:45pm - Arrive home, immediately start dinner & homework<br>  7:00pm - 7:15pm - Eat dinner, immediately followed by dishes & bathtime<br>  8pm - Hannah in bed, read a chapter or 2 from the bedtime book<br>  8:30pm - Lights out for Hannah<br>  8:30 - 10pm - Misc. housework, maybe catch up on a TV show if I'm lucky, get everything ready for tomorrow.<br>  10pm - Fall into bed....ZZZZzzzzzz.......(I'll be up at 4:30am to start over again)

492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Health Visitors have a special talent for making you feel bad.  I remember my daughter at about 11 weeks used to have a really dry throat when I woke her at 10pm for her last feed (she was on a routine where she went to bed at 7pm, I woke her at 10pm for a feed and she would sleep then till 7am).<br>  <br>  So I asked the HV what could be causing the dry throat and she looked at me and said "why are you waking her up at 10?" It was at that point that I lost all confidence in them.<br>  <br>  Back to your daughter though.  Seriously, as long as you are not overfeeding her then I wouldn't worry.  The graphs are there to show each extreme and your daughter is just a the top end.<br>  <br>  You know best for your own daughter and as long as you aren't feeding her chocolate and crisps (which I am sure you are not and why would you?!) then just carry on.  If you are worried then see a doctor instead.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	How does her weight compare to her height?  Since she is high on both for the weight for age and height for age it almost sounds like she'd be quite average (around 50 percentile) for weight for height chart.|`|x3fQP9viaa	Yes, measurements can be wrong.  Get a new doctor.  Don't be alarmed it sounds like she is naturally growing into her body.  The doctor and nurses can be way out of line at times.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	Don't stress about what the health visitor says.  I had one who made me feel horrible because she thought I was underfeeding my twins.  My twins have always been on the lower end of scale and she was telling me to increase what they eat.  But my twins will not eat more.  The nurse that sees them now says she is happy with their weight gain.  Even though they are on the lower end they are following their own scale and was told not to worry.  To be honest I don't even bother comparing my twins to the percentile scale.  I just make sure my twins are fed and healthy.  If I were you find another health visitor if that is possible.  Take care.|`|VMASMHX6aa	It's almost impossible to measure the height of a baby 100% accurately. It's very easy for the measurement to be 1cm off, which will make a bit difference on where your child is on her chart.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	She might have a thyroid issue....and I don't like the way people have been treating you...go to someplace else to get a second opinion.|`|xwOwsZvEaa	i would b more concerned about her height!|`|c73QkZ2haa	I dont think her height didnt drop it just means she slowed down. The 75th percentile means that 75% of babies are smaller than her and so on. Kids eventually slow down it isnt healthy to grow super fast as well as not grow at all. I wouldnt be concerned about her weight shes still young as long as she is eating healthy she should be ok but if you are concerned just do more physical things with her.<br>  Every baby is different size. One of my twins is in the 95th percentile while the other one is in the 50 range. Some babies are just bigger. My older daughter dropped off the chart at the top between 2 and 3 because she grew so fast and weighed so much.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Well my baby went from the 90s in the percentile to being in the 50s 5 months later....we just saw the HV the other day...mine was not worried and said it is probably because she crawled early...if your HV was rude then ask to see another. I encountered a rude and stupid HV with my 2nd baby....I knew they were not all like that as I had had a daughter previously...I rang the office and said I would not see this lady again as she made comments about my religion...(or lack of it!) How old is your baby?|`|vue9NOhYaa	Measuring infants is very difficult.  They squirm around and it's very hard to get an accurate legnth.  In addition, even small variations in length can make a big difference in percentiles. Finally, babies have growth spurts where they grow a lot, and then may go several months growing very little. (This is true of all measures.)<br>  <br>  So... don't worry about it.  She's fine..
uJnvFKyLaa	I know how fustrating it can be to have a little one that is always hungry, sometimes it seemed like as soon as I would start doing anything, there he was screaming for the boobs, but breastfeeding isn't just feeding. It's about comfort and bonding too. You cannot over breast feed a baby! Just make sure that you have the support that you need, that means that your significant other needs to pick up the slack so that you can be successful. Keep at it and she will slow down as she gets older, just don't give up! I know that there were plenty of times that I was ready to just quit but just when it seemed like I couldn't take it anymore it started to get better. If you start to feel like you absoulutely cannot feed her one more time today, take a step back, give you significant other a bottle and the baby and go take a long bath. A single bottle once in a blue moon does not hurt your breastfeeding, it does not make you less of a mom, and that little bit of a break will give you a chance to regroup and come out of that tub knowing that you CAN do this. You will treasure the memories of the time you spent breastfeeding for the rest of your life, with each one of mine I wished I had gone longer, felt that I weaned too early (5 mo) (6mo) (11 mo)  (and the last one is 13mo and still going strong) . I found that having a stack of books to read or a journal and a pen on the table next to where I sat was really helpful to pass the time when it seems like all you do is feed the baby.|`|hVVALFAPaa	She will not overeat but sometimes might 'chew' on you, using you as a pacifier. You can feel the difference between real nursing and just needing to suck on something.<br>  <br>  Babies do go through a growth spurt at around 11-12 weeks, so she may eat more, and be fussier.|`|AHHAGxlCaa	hiya - congratulations on your new baby!<br>  <br>  My son was breastfed and he fed on demand also, if they take it then they are hungry but also bear in mind she may be using the breast as a comforter, its just like a baby having a dummy - keep going with it and you'll soon have a routine.|`|113FoyMFaa	She wont over eat.<br>  <br>  The cool thing about breast feeding is that the baby can decide how much milk they want to come out.  Some of the time it looks like she's eating, but she's really comfort sucking (just taking a little milk)|`|f0c14af9cf77a6bb68c4ffdbb372cdacaa	This is like reading a question I could have posted!!  My 10 week old daughter is exactly the same although she weighs 12.7lbs and measures 60cm!  She hardly ever cries and when she does I offer her the breast, sometimes she takes it and other times its like she's headbutting me!  My little one can latch on quite happily for 3/4 of an hour and not be eating anything....thank you for asking the question, I know I haven't answered it but it's nice to know that someone else was wondering the same and going through the same!  Congratulations on your baby ;o)|`|1f8ac7480f6fa04b361732301e5dba7faa	I agree that sometimes baby will cry and fuss when not really hungry,but if she does latch on then she is hungry.Don't worry though as your baby will  feed when she is hungry and you are probably realising breast milk is quite thin and your baby will feed a lot more fequently than her bottlefed peers.This is normal.Happy feeding.|`|kf1PWDb8aa	Yes she will eat if she is not hungry. Sometimes when baby's are bored or want your attentions they will cry like they are hungry. Keep in mind sometimes they are hungry. I kept my kids to there schedule, even though they say breastfeed baby can can't go on a schedule I put my kids on a schedule. I feed them ever  3 hours at that age. And my kids were tiny like yours. Good luck!!|`|Yba724Wkaa	Yes they will latch on but from my experience she may be using you like a binky for comfort. My baby is 4 weeks and does the same and my last baby wouldnt take a bink but did want to nurse for comfort.|`|9ganxm8iaa	Just use your best judgment, only you know your baby best!   Mine would nurse until they fell asleep and stayed on a pretty consistent schedule.  But, if they weren't feeling well or were tired or scared they also wanted to nurse and I would allow them.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	some babies will use breastfeeding to simply suck on something. babies naturally have an urge to soothe themselves through sucking.|`|wURg3jBcaa	Does she pop off a lot and fuss while feeding?  She's probably not hungry.  If she latches and eats- then don't worry about it.  Breastfed babies won't eat if they're totally full.  (Sounds like her weight is normal- so you're doing fine.)|`|vue9NOhYaa	You can't overfeed a breastfed baby if she's only getting breastmilk.<br>  <br>  One of the great things about breastfeeding is that is works well as both food and comfort.  If a baby wants to suck but isn't hungry, she will do what's called 'non-nutritive suckling' -- which allows her to nurse while only getting a very small trickle of milk. If she DOES want to eat, she will nurse more vigerously.<br>  <br>  Keep listening to your baby's cues, and offer the breast as she seems to want/need.
nuBRcuwvaa	It is terribly hard, but I try to NEVER interrupt my husband from his version of comforting.<br>  <br>  It seems to drag on forever sometimes, but it is very very important that daddy learns how to do this.  The crying might annoy or upset you, but really the baby is fine.  The baby might not be perfectly happy, but he/she is ok.  So let daddy figure it out.  He isn't dumb, if he really can't figure it out, then he will come and get you.<br>  <br>  I was very much rewarded for this hard work, because in the end, my husband did find out some new ways to comfort the little one that I could then try.  Especially as my son gets older (now 2.5) my husband and I equally succeed and fail at calming him down after different scenarios.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS - Even if you were nursing, you could pump bottles for "nights off."|`|723QHuicaa	I give it a few mins, and if I know its me she wants, then I will just take her off him. He is ok with it. Im a full time mum, he knows its only natural she wants me if something is wrong. She wants him when she wants to be chased or tickled, and Im ok with that too - we have our own area's of expertise.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Bless my husband for trying but sometimes Noah just wants me. It's natural, I'm at home with him all day long so he is a definite Mommy's boy.<br>  <br>  I give him 5-10 minutes(unless Noah is crying hysterically) and after that I'll offer to take him. He does good with him at nights, though. I give him a kiss and a cuddle and then Daddy is able to rock him a few minutes and put him down for bed.<br>  <br>  It may just be HOW your husband is trying to comfort/soothe your son. Is he doing it at all how you do it? Is he calm when he's holding him? I know I hold Noah a bit differently than my husband does and sometimes it makes a difference. Sometimes not.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I wish I could star this question 20 times!<br>  <br>  I am so guilty of this. My husband tries so hard! SO hard! Dane is a mama's boy though. Mommy has the magic touch. I let it go on for a few minutes before I (and this is so bad of me I know) Give my husband the exasperated sigh and say, "Just give him here" I know it ticks my husband off and I would really like to just ignore it but the mom in me can't.<br>  <br>  My husband works 60+ hour weeks so I am the main person in Dane's life. It isn't my husband's fault but Dane just prefers me. My down fall is I don't say it but my actions say, "It IS your fault" I need to work on that...|`|EmYNUZcXaa	i watch for the looks on my husbands face. i think we all know when our partner gets fed up or frustrated when we see that "look" on his face. i try not to tell my husband what to do, so i'll say something like, "maybe she needs to be burped?" or "she could need her diaper changed, maybe?" like a secret hint so that your hubby or partner feels like they're doing it themselves w/o being told and controlled. its worked for me so far and my husband gets better and better and starts to go down the line of what could be making our daughter fussy and cry: diaper, gas, boredom, binkie, etc. just try to sneak in the helpful hints with questions ;)|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I think it kind of upsets my husband because our son prefers me when he needs comforting. He cries and wiggles and reaches for me. He spends most of his time with me though so he does understand. Our son prefers him when it comes to playing though so it works out. Give them their time but you know when you need to step in.|`|AA10145416	omg is totally my situation, my husband is the same way and i dont have a choice but to not sleep  every night (baby is turning two months)|`|5jjGo6XTaa	you husband deff needs more practic and that also will make the baby to be able to be ok will daddys help instead on mammas if you baby is only used to you yoiu baby will only want you and i would deff get you child used to the dad or you baby will become very attatched to you. so do let him try more and dont go in the room the father needs to find his own way of doing thing you can suggest your ways but if he finds somthing that works then let him do his own thing.|`|955YoHvVaa	My husband is great with our daughter, he usually can calm her just as easily as I can...infact sometimes I think she likes him more..but I think if you maybe try and explain to him how you get your son settled again and let him try that maybe it will be easier on your husband..I would feel helpless too if I were your husband and he tried everything to comfort your child and it wasn't working but your husband also has to understand sometimes moms are the only solution.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I decide by how fussy he is.  If he is just wimpering slightly, and trying to get  his thumb in his mouth to self soothe, then I let them go. If it escalates to all out screaming, then I take over because at that point, the only thing that will settle him is nursing, and I do breast feed, so my husband can't do anything then.  Fortunately, he sleeps through the night, so it is only an issue during the day.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Ugh... I have the opposite problem!  I'm with the baby all day and during the day I can calm and soothe him, when the sun goes down it's a different story.  The baby will wake up at night and scream his head off, nothing I do will work, but if I wake up the hubby and hand the baby over he stops instantly.  Probably just a comfort thing for the baby, it's frustrating!  So, give your hubby a break he's trying!|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	I try and try giving it a few mins before I go in and say or do anything. Course I have a husband who has little or no patience and gives up very easily. Or sometimes when I know jeffrey just whines out and usually just needs a patted back or a his head rubbed to go back to sleep. My husband will pick him up and bring him into the living room with every light on. He's done this 2x and it would take 1 hr to get him back to sleep. Which I dont care bc hes my son. Only reason I frustrates me is bc MY husband will up and go to bed after he does this and leave me alone to struggle with it. My son naturally wants me to do more or I know which cries are what. I am naturally more nurturing and my husband tries but he just isnt. Hes kinda cold sometimes without knowing he does it. My son picks up on that. We are bottle feeding also.<br>  <br>   I actually got to leave the house for more than 4 hrs yesterday while I left my son here with my husband. I really felt I was like "naked" bc Im used to having a baby in tow. I went shopping with my mom and sister. I told her I felt lost and she said " it never goes away" lol. It was the first time in almost 9 months I was out that long without a baby..
AA12145826	Ooooh this is hard..<br>  <br>  We're members of the Columbus zoo, so my first instinct is to say that I like the Cols zoo best. They have a wonderful manatee exhibit and I really like the gorilla complex as well. It is technically the largest zoo in the US and Jack Hanna (my daughter's hero....seriously) is our director emeritus. So it has those things going for it.<br>  <br>  But the Cincinnati zoo has a fantastic cheetah exhibit (really one of the best in the country if you ask me) and is very unique as well. I personally thing the layout of the zoo is one of the better I've visited (and trust me, we've been to quite a few). Its geared more towards keeping the flow of traffic moving & making sure you don't keep visiting the same area over & over again which is really nice if you're trying to see it all in one day. We really enjoyed our visit there a few summers ago and plan on going back this summer since they now have a set of cheetah cubs.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  I just have to add that I agree with the poster below me...the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is great as well. The Rain Forest complex is probably the most fascinating zoo building I have ever been in. While we're on the subject, the Toledo zoo is really nice too! If you're into reptiles, they have the coolest reptile house ever! From what I remember, their King Cobra exhibit is on both sides of the walk area with a plexiglass covered walkway so you can see them slithering from one side to the other....very creepy! <br>  <br>  Ohio is very fortunate to have so many wonderful zoo that have strong suits in very different areas of animal care, breeding, conservation, etc.|`|wnVGeG8uaa	I havent been to either, but I LOVE pretty much any zoo.. probably a little too much for someone my age, lol.

The city, not the zoo) It's huge and has so many great exhibits. They have one huge glass building that simulates a rainforest with beautiful tropical flowers and fauna with macaws and sloths just hanging out. They have a lot of elephants and giraffes, which are always big hits with the kids. They also have an aquarium with penguins, manatees, etc. The Cincy Zoo is actually rated one of the top zoos in the country and I really enjoy going there.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I haven't ever taken the kids to any other zoo than the ones here in TX.

Fkl6gV8Qaa	My babies always leaked milk but I think that is because when my milk let down there was some serious pressure behind it. Also my breasts leaked a lot as I had A LOT of supply compared to the demand. I very rarely breastfed my babies laying down like that though as neither of them really latched on well that way. When I did I just laid a burp towel down on the bed before we laid down. I think the drippy milk face is about the cutest face a baby can have.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mystic is not only an advocate she is just full of.........answers too isn't she. My goodness that was a very long answer for a not so long question.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	my daughter always leaked.. it's because she would fall asleep on the breast and still have milk in her mouth.  to me, it's better that it leaks out rather than staying in the mouth for the baby to possibly choke on.|`|A1QpwziEaa	i used to side nurse when my baby fed through out the night and no, I never had a problem with milk leaking from their mouth....unless it's spit up, but the big difference between a bottle and a breast is that milk will continue to drip out of a bottle nipple with the help of just a bit of gravity.  You have to physically pull (suck) milk out of the breast to draw it out - which is why if you give a bottle to a baby too early, they may prefer the ease of the bottle nipple.  You baby sounds like she's falling asleep with bottle in her mouth and some milk will continue to drip out without her being awake to swallow.....which is also why they recommend you not "prop" a bottle because you can't stop the milk flow.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I used to feed my son in bed while laying down. Yes milk can still leak out of their mouths. Most of the time we didn't have any problems but on occasion he would throw up from laying down I guess from improper digestion. I feed him laying down because he was a big baby and I had alot of back problems. But it is recommended that you prop them up for 20 minutes after they eat and not let them fall asleep breastfeeding. I used to allow him to fall asleep and if I tried to move him he would wake up and cry. So that is up to you but it is not recommended. He was my first and I didn't have any other responsibilities other than him being that I was a stay at home mother of one. I am 23 weeks pregna t with my second and probably will not get my baby into this habit since I have another child to take care of. Once they get used to falling asleep nursing, they want to do it every time and it is hard to move them without waking them since they are cuddling with you and feel the warmth. Just thought that I would give you something to consider.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	The only time milk leaks from my sons mouth is if he falls asleep with milk in his mouth. But generally, even if I feed him while lying on our sides in bed, there is little to no leaking. <br>  <br>  Just pay attention to her sucking and you'll know when her mouth is empty.|`|KDb96QS7aa	My kid dribbles milk while eating all the time (not constantly) but day, night, whenever, you name it. I think he's just being lazy/distracted/tired. I think it's when he isn't 100% focused on eating for some reason.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	yes it happens to me. i formula feed and the milk will leak or he will slurp and it will fly on to my arm. i think he is drinking on one side and making his cheeks to full that it spills out. that is my theroy so im probably wrong lol|`|TWeRUgXxaa	yeah i think it happens with bottle feeding moms more because i think its the shape of the nipple too u know, how they need to get used to it and their little mouths u know|`|Ew1UGEJnaa	While breastfeeding my daughter in the beginning, i tried to nurse her and lay her down- and then sleep deprivation prevailed. Ever since, she just lays next to me an nurses at her leisure during the night. <br>  she does leak milk, because at a certain point of sleepiness she is sucking but not swallowing. It has never seemed to make her choke or anything of the sort, but it does stain the sheets. If you're concerned, gently insert your finger into her mouth and break suction when she gets to the sleep point. No milk will pool in her mouth and you don't have to worry. good Luck|`|T0gv52CDaa	Occasionally, the last little bit that he sucked in prior to falling asleep will dribble out of the corner of his mouth, but if I'm laying down while feeding him, it is usually because I want to sleep.  If I'm sleeping while nursing him, my breast usually stays in his mouth, so even if he falls asleep while nursing, he will still suckle and end up swallowing most of it.  When I do notice that some milk has leaked out of his mouth, I just wipe it up.  I don't think there is anything that can or needs to be done to stop it.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	yes i feed like that and no milk doesnt usually leak out of her mouth. in a bottle, the milk is constantly dripping out, even ofter the baby falls asleep. from the breast, milk only comes out when the baby is actively suckling|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Regardless of mom's position breastfed babies are nearly always lying down, that's just the way breastfeeding works.  The cradle hold, cross-cradle hold, and football holds all have the baby lying nearly flat.  <br>  <br>  In general the only reason that a breastfed baby laying down would have milk leaking out is if mom has a severe overactive letdown.  That is why side-lying is sometimes recommended for mom's with an overactive letdown, the baby can just let the excess milk flow out of the side of their mouth.<br>  <br>  Breastfed babies also nurse on their sides, whereas to keep air out of the nipple bottle fed babies are fed flat on their backs.<br>  <br>  So, I would have to guess, that for formula fed babies milk leaking means the same thing:<br>  1) Not latched on properly -even for bottles the baby is supposed to suck on the whole nipple and have "fishy lips" not just suck on the tip<br>  2) The milk is coming too fast<br>  3) Baby is sucking for comfort, and because of the nature of bottles (they drip no matter what) the baby is getting milk they don't want so they are just letting it flow back out.  Breastfed babies of mom's with an overactive letdown sometimes do the same thing only when comfort sucking.  In general in moms with normal supplies and normal babies they can easily comfort suck without getting milk.<br>  <br>  But finally, I want to be clear that bottle feeding laying down is a risk for ear infections, unlike breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/ear-infection-nursing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/ear...</a><br>  You might hear that breastfeeding your baby in a lying down position will cause ear infections. Research indicates that this is not true. No matter what positioning you use, breastfeeding actually works to decrease the incidence of ear infections.<br>  <br>  This myth is one of many that has come from a mistaken application of bottle-feeding information to breastfeeding. There is good evidence that if baby is given a bottle of formula while lying flat, the formula can get into the Eustachian tubes and middle ear and cause an infection. However, there are two problems with applying this fact to breastfeeding: (1) breastmilk and formula are not the same -- breastmilk inhibits the formation of bacteria, while formula encourages bacteria; and (2) breastfeeding and bottle feeding are not the same -- milk does not pool in the mouth when baby is nursing, as as it does when baby drinks from a bottle.<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that with most nursing positions, baby is lying down while nursing anyway - whether mom is lying down or not!<br>  <br>  So don't be afraid to lie down to nurse your baby. Go ahead and get your rest... while you nurse your baby.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/baby/bhealth/0,,485q,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/baby/bheal...</a><br>   In breastfeeding, the milk only flows when the baby sucks. The suck is usually followed by a swallow and this greatly reduces the risk that milk will pool in the baby's mouth and enter the Eustachian tubes.<br>  <br>  With bottle feeding, the formula can flow even when the baby is not sucking and swallowing, leading to milk pooling in the mouth and increasing the risk that formula will enter the ears. This is one reason that bottles should never be propped-up for the baby. Even when babies are held during a bottle feeding it is possible for milk to enter the Eustachian tubes because babies are usually fed on their back. (Lawrence 1994)<br>  <br>  Breastfed babies are usually on their side, or with their head slightly elevated during feedings. Breastfeeding at night can not be compared to bottle propping because of the mechanics involved as well as the immune factors. Formula is much more irritating if it gets into the ear. Remember, it is a foreign substance, unlike breastmilk. Additionally the antibodies in breastmilk would tend to discourage the growth of bacteria, if it did get into the middle ear, unlike formula that has no antibodies. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_774.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_774.html</a><br>  Accomplices: This job cannot be pulled off alone. Something must plug the eustachian tube for an ear infection to occur. Most commonly an upper respiratory infection is the culprit. The accomplice might also be a change in elevation, allergies, an irritant (such as cigarette smoke), reflux, or drinking a bottle while lying on the back.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081600.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081600...</a><br>  4. Feed baby upright. Lying down while bottle-feeding can cause the milk to irritate the Eustachian tube which can contribute to ear infections.

My vast experience of owning 22 prams with my two daughters has taught me what to buy and what not to buy. At the moment I am "looking" to purchase a pram for my baby due in September. Im trying to avoid the extra cost of buying a moses basket, stand and car seat and trying to leave a high chair until he/she can feed themselves.The pram that I have come across is pretty much fitting all my statistics. You can buy these prams second hand on ebay if you cant stretch your budget. <br>  <br>  The first link shows the pram Im after. Its ￡200 reduced at the moment though Im not purchasing yet. It comes with a carry cot that can double up as a moses basket, a stand to put the carry cot on. The seat unit can be used on the stand as a high chair for the baby until the baby can feed themselves then I will get a high chair. Im going for the x cel chassis but you can get a different chassis. Also Im going to get the chassis that make this pram become a buggy later on from ebay. The second link is the same pram but on a different chassis. The 3rd link is a pram on ebay with all the extras with the second chassis .<br>  The 4th link is the chassis I need later on without buying a buggy. The last link is a reasonable price for this pram.<br>  <br>  <br>  However that's just my opinion.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	that pram is so cute and i have never seen it before but the price is ok|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	ok, my friend bought one of those from ebay and she regrets it!!! its heavy, bulky and cumbersom, she has put it back on ebay 3 weeks after, i won't recommend it.<br>  i bought a navy nipper 360 (from ebay:) for my baby girl at ￡175 and its ace <br>  i can not recommend it enough<br>  I know that u want baby to face you but trust me they sleep almost always on prams! <br>  good luck !!|`|Bg6txvxqaa	That looks exactly the same as the twin pram I have sent off for from dat-babyhus on ebay.<br>  <br>  If they do twin prams on there I think I'll cancel the other one and go with them instead.

cAtWxJG1aa	oh, happiness.  i wanted to answer this when someone asked it last week but i wasn't allowed....<br>  <br>  i think children are born with an instinct for preserving their self-interest.  sometimes self-interest leads people to do things that are "bad" (like stealing what you want); sometimes it leads people to do things that are good (like being nice to your sister because it makes you happy to see her smile).  part of being brought up properly includes being taught that it is in all of our collective long-term self-interest if we agree as a society to act in ways that are sometimes contrary to our own personal short-term self-interest.  thus it's in a child's self-interest if everyone agrees not to steal ... because otherwise people will be stealing from the child, as well.<br>  <br>  i do not believe anyone is born evil.  i do believe some people suffer from mental illness that makes it difficult for them to regulate their behavior and distinguish right from wrong.  i think most people that we'd really consider "evil" are sociopaths who fall in that category.  i also believe that some people's circumstances are so brutal that they cease to care what counts as right and wrong, and some people have trouble putting their short-term interests on hold in the interest of our collective long-term interests.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I believe all of us are born with a sin nature (not necessarily evil though).  You don't have to teach a child to lie or to throw a tantrum or to not share.  It's because we are selfish and self centered by nature.<br>  <br>  You do have to teach children patience, honesty, sharing, kindness. selflessness and self control.  If we were born possessing these skills then we would not need parents (or at least for many people including myself, we would not need God's guidance or salvation).  <br>  <br>  We all have to be taught to do the right thing.  You normally don't have to teach a child to do the wrong thing.  However the environment we grow up in greatly influences us and children in general.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I think that all living things naturally desire to live in balance with the world & other living things around them.  <br>  <br>  I think we are largely shaped by our environment, by the experiences that happen to us.   <br>  <br>  Every person certainly has their own personality, their own soul, their own way of looking at things, but I believe that, with the right teachers, the right people guiding them in ways that they understand & that make sense to them, the right lessons & experiences helping them to find their place in the world, every person naturally desires to live in harmony with the world and people around them.  <br>  <br>  You often hear about people who others think were 'raised well' by their parents, who's other siblings were perfect, but they turned out bad, lost themselves.  I believe that those people's parents, well-intentioned though they may be, just didn't know how to reach *that child* in particular.  They may be great with all of the other kids, may know the way to reach those ones just fine - but, they just didn't find the key to helping that particular child find his/her harmonious place in the world.<br>  <br>  I don't think you have to teach a child how to do the right thing any more than you have to teach them not to do the wrong thing.  Both will happen, naturally.  Parents need to be there to help them recognize which is bad and which is good.|`|j2mRop0laa	I think most kids are born with a blank slate.<br>  I also think some kids that have emotional disorders and aren't treated can be perceived as "bad" simply because the parents didn't have the tools to help them.<br>  <br>  I do know a few people I grew up with that I could have sworn were born evil...|`|hKJIDdVqaa	children are all born 'good', humanity makes them evil.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Well I don't know about anyone else, but MY children were definitely not born evil.  I think it's human nature to show certain bad qualities throughout your childhood.  For example, we are all selfish to some extent which is why it makes total sense for even babies to find it difficult to share.  <br>  <br>  It's hard to say how much of our behavior comes naturally or from the environment we're raised in.  I just can't bring myself to believe that any baby is born evil.  It just doesn't seem right to think that way.|`|86oPkfzOaa	An old question of "nature vs nurture".I can definitely say that both counts. Some kids are born aggressive, loud, energetic, others quiet sensitive ,easy going. However a good  parent will raise a good, well behaving yet still temperamental child and a bad parent will turn a difficult child into a violent adult. Nice quiet children can be turn into misbehaving troubles, but I don't think they will ever become as bad as children which were born difficult.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't think that people are born necessarily "evil" but I do think that it is quite possible to have 2 very loving parents, a very good environment growing up in... and still end up what we would call "evil", most of the time these people have some sort of mental illness that either has or has not been diagnosed.<br>  If it has been diagnosed at an early age, the chance that they will not go on to commit a horrific crime may lessen significantly, if not...well then you may end up with someone like Jeffery Daulmer!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	You should watch that movie Joshua, then you'll give an the answer EVIL...<br>  <br>  Seriously though, I don't children are born good or bad.

She really didn't want to nurse that much, I think it hurt her little gums because of the pressure it put on them. She didn't even want her rice cereal which she usually loves, so it made her more fussy and me more tired. I ended up using teething tablets before she nursed, it helped a little. Mine didn't like cold teething rings, so a few times I stuck a wet wash cloth in the freezer and then rubbed her gums with that. She ate a little better after that.

I put my hands on the bulge and gently push down.  He or She shimmies down lower then. Sucking in will be more uncomfortable to you then harming the baby.  I really don't think you can hurt the baby some docs really wail hard on your tummy to check how things are.  I doubt you are being that rough.  And if your baby is like mine He or She hates outside interference.  :)|`|vue9NOhYaa	Neither pushing on your stomach nor 'sucking it in' is dangerous.  Baby is well protected and it would take considerable violence to risk harming it.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	its fine although why would you!<br>  <br>  as the pregnancy goes on u wait and see how hard the midwife/doctor presses on ur tummy boy it can really hurt if baby in a  bad postion!<br>  <br>  baby will be fine x x x|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Some of the above answers are crazy!! You're not going to hurt your baby by pushing on your belly. Really....You would have to push very very hard to do anything at all. The baby is very protected inside your belly, in the uterus, in water. You're touch isn't going to do anything. Anyone who tells you that you're going to crush your baby has probably never been pregnant!|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	i dont think it's dangerous because when i had my 20 week ultrasound the person pressed so hard on my stomach that it really hurt. and everytime i go to the doctors they always press really hard to figure out where my uterus is and where the baby is. if it was dangerous i dont think the doctor would be doing it.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	The doctor can do it because hes a professional so he knows what hes doing that wont harm the baby you on the other hand wouldnt know so I would stop doing it and for the sucking in your stomach why would you want to? I dont think its dangerous but its uncomfortable.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I don't know if it's bad or not, but i personally wouldn't do either.<br>  <br>  Sucking in could squash your baby, why would you want to suck your pregnant belly in anyway? <br>  <br>  Pushing your stomach probably isn't dangerous because your midwife does it to feel your babys position and stuff, but they know exactly what theyr'e doing whereas you don't, so i wouldn't incase i pushed too hard in a area i shouldn't push.<br>  <br>  If you're just trying to feel your bump, you don't need to push your stomach, just feel it when you lay flat.|`|1sTZVmZEaa	Yes, you are not supposed to push into your stomach if your pregnant, the baby can get crushed, and sucking in will only hurt you.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	pushing lightly will not hurt the baby.  I wouldn't make it an all day adventure, but it shouldn't hurt the baby.|`|P25GuvNjaa	No, its not dangerous
ESQ5hriGaa	You are doing just fine!  If he'll take it at room temp then don't worry about warming it up, but if your husband wants to warm it for you tell him go ahead! ;)  I had a horrible time starting breastfeeding and after the first couple of days just pumped and bottle fed all the time.  It was just easier for us.  yes some babies will have nipple confusion but some will be just fine, and if you are still offereing the breast first at each feeding and finishing it off with a bottle I don't think you'll have a problem.  Do what you have to to keep nursing, and don't worry about what other people tell you is the "right" way.  What's important is that your baby is getting the breastmilk.  It doesn't matter how he gets it.  And although this may not work for all babies I pumped and bottle fed for about 2 months putting him to the breast every other week or so just to see what would happen and once he was 2- 2  1/2 months old he started nursing just fine all the time.  I hope you can get the nursing figured out- a lactation consultant should be very helpful and once he get's better things will probably go easier.  Good luck!|`|077c6d4e4b9978f72bfc78160c727f2aaa	Yes it is absolutely fine!  And please don't get too hung up on what people say here about breastfeeding.  Some women have lots of challenges and it comes easy to others.  Listen more to your lactation consultant.  Good luck!|`|c73QkZ2haa	Warming it up is really just a comfort thing. Breastmilk is warm when it isnt expressed that is :)...He may not take it cool though if hes used to it warm.|`|eRyCzwMcaa	Why aren't you just putting the baby to the breast when he is hungry?  Nothing empties a breast better than a baby.  By solely expressing you will be diminishing your supply over time, not increasing it with the needs of the child. <br>  <br>  Edit:  My apologies.  I wasn't asking to be nosy or to make you feel bad.  I was asking because there is a lot of misinformation around about breastfeeding.  <br>  <br>  Is it possible to attempt to nurse and then pump?  This will help him to build his nursing reflexes and then pumping will finish emptying the breasts and work to increase your supply.<br>  <br>  If the baby will drink it room temp, there shouldn't be a problem giving it to him at room temp.  There are antibacterial properties in breastmilk.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Sure, it's fine.  She can have it warm, or room temp, or cold. However he'll take it is fine.<br>  <br>  (However, 8 days is really too early to be giving bottles.  He's still at high risk for nipple confusion, and needs to be nursing at every feed to get your milk supply well established.  Wait until 4-6 weeks to start giving the occassional bottle.)|`|C4miEeuYaa	Breast milk is absolutely fine at room temp for up to 5 hours. When I first got home, I would pump and she wouldn't eat it for 3 hours. I would let it sit next to the bed and wait till she wanted it. She was absolutely fine and the pediatrician said that was fine. As long as you don't let him half way eat it, then give him the rest later. Once his mouth hits the bottle, there's a higher chance of bacteria growing the longer it stays out. Rule of thumb, typically, is the bottle is only good for an hour after they start feeding from it, breast milk or formula.BTW-My baby was jaundiced too. We had the same exact problem except I don't have inverted nipples.
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Not all cheese is bad for you. Just cheese spread etc. Doritos are fine except for not being that healthy for you. You're fine.|`|p0prrzf2aa	if it's unpasteurized it is. also make you constipated : /|`|MtC3CWZraa	Cheese made from pasteurized milk is perfectly safe. What you're talking about isn't exactly cheese though. It's an artificial cheese flavored powder. Doritos or any crisps/chips for that matter aren't exactly health food though.|`|UaL28atDaa	Take a look at this its a website that explains anything and everything you will need to know about pregnancy. Here is their section on safe foods to eat while pregnant.

The only cheese you need to stay away from is sift cheeses like feta, brie, blue cheese, and anything unpasteurized.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Never heard that, cheese is fine.  You're pregnant, not lactose intolerant.|`|WbaSpiYpaa	Don't worry about it.  The only cheese that's really not so good for you is the soft cheeses they have at the deli.  I think the Doritos are fine.
Fd4lITkvaa	I had heard that cramping was strong when you have your first period but I didn't find it to be true for myself. My periods are very heavy but I have barely any cramping at all, I had awful cramping before pregnancy. I would assume it's your period.
HdOVYIWjaa	I remember in college taking a human sexuality class my professor said something about many people have miscarriages when they do not even know they are pregnant.  They could be perfectly healthy, but the egg has been fertilized too late, meaning before it had time to attach to the uterine wall and it would come out during your menstrual cycle.  The number is impossible to pinpoint, but I do remember hearing that is some large percentage maybe 20-30%.  It is really sad that girls will claim they have miscarriages, it's becoming a fad to be pregnant.  I thought I had a miscarriage once, I was 3 weeks late and then started bleeding for about 2 days and then didn't get my period again for another 5 weeks.  I talked to my Gyno and she said it was possible that I could've had a miscarriage, but no way to tell.   I'm not sure if I did or didn't but it was traumatic to me to know there was a great possibility that I did lose a baby.  It's a shame that girls would tell a lie like that to get sympathy/popularity.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	They are actually pretty common happening in around 10-20 percent of comfirmed pregnancies although the number is thought to be more because most people miscarry without knowing they were even pregnant. I am 24 years old and I have a beautiful 3 year old son, unfortunately that pregnancy was followed by 2 miscarriages(due to a genetic blood clotting disorder) and I am now 14 weeks pregnant again. The problem with highschoolers is that it is becoming a trend in a sick sort of way to say you are pregnant and then that you miscarried. I personally don't understand it.I would never wish a miscarriage on anyone and I wish that some girls would think before they actually make a story like that up.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Apparently according to research....more people miscarry thier first pregnancy then go through with the whole pregancy to have a healthy baby.<br>  At school though to be honest, girls can just make that stuff up and obviously saying they had a miscarriage is a perfect way to get out thier lie.|`|mTl9l3aMaa	Nah, they pro'lly either had an abortion, or self-induced the miscarriage. Miscarriages are mostly common on older women.|`|b9OaXmmDaa	They could be common in high school because their bodies weren't ready to support the baby.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Pretty common actually, about 25%. But most are very early before people know they are pregnant. Usually only those who are trying or scared to find out, test first (sometimes even before their period), get a positive result and then get their period a day late.<br>  <br>  But remember in high school, it's used alot for drama, which is sad as miscarriages are devastating.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Right at the beginning, it can be upwards of 50 percent before people even KNOW they are pregnant (most people find out around 3 weeks). So in the first 3 weeks, ~50% miscarry, though I've heard up to 80%. <br>  Between the 3rd and 12th week it's closer to 20%.<br>  <br>  There was a girl in highschool who lied about being pregnant ALOT amongst other things. None of these are true but just what she said and it all CONVENIENTLY lined up with christmas holidays or her vacation or summer.<br>  Grade 9 she had brain cancer and had a baby which died after birth <br>  Grade 10 she has MS and was Bisexual and had 2 miscarriages. <br>  Grade 11 she had a brain tumor again and lukemia and had twins which she gave up for adoption but then adopted a 13 year old and a 2 year old. Oh, and was a lesbian and her twins were IVF.<br>  Grade 12 she was 7 months pregnant and had a miscarriage when she fell off her chair during class, and she was straight again and got married and then got divorced and then got engaged to some girl and then she had twins again. <br>  And there were 2 other miscarriages in there too which she lost falling off a bench and getting kicked by a horse.<br>  <br>  Now a few years after high school she ACTUALLY has a baby... <br>  <br>  <br>  @lala,,, a women's body is best equipped to carry a baby between the ages of 13 and 18. After that, their body starts to deteriorate and they are MORE likely to miscarriage. 15 year olds are VERY fertile.

1tmX7xbRaa	my daughter used to eat like that when she started cereal too. isn't it too cute? i don't know why some people wait. i started rice cereal at 4 months i kept my daughter on that for about 2 weeks then moved to oatmeal, then two weeks after that i started each fruit and veggie. i just waited the two weeks in between everything to make sure she didn't have any allergies or digestion problems. my daughters pediatrician told me i only needed to wait 4-5 days between trying new food items but i used the extra week just to make sure. i am not sure why some people wait. i didn't|`|X6as2nOAaa	I didn't wait, I gave her rice at 3 1/2 months and jarred food at 4 months the doc said I could and now she is almost 7 months in 3 days and she is perfectly healthy and is a great little baby. I think people wait because they over analyze everything went you become a parent.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I started my kids on rice cereal at about 3-1/2 months old. All of my kids were on stage 1 baby food by 4 1/2months old. I think it depends on the baby and what they are ready for. Each baby is different. But none of my kids would have waited until 6months for baby food....formula would just not have been enough...they were hungry little monsters lol|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	For my son they said we could start rice cereal now (he is 4 months), but we are supposed to hold off on jar food until six months. Even then we are supposed to do just one at a time (2 weeks apart) and in a specific order. We have to because both my older son and I have food allergies. I wouldn't think it would be as big of a deal if you don't have a family history of allergies, but I would do the only one new food every 2 weeks thing though. That way if your child has a reaction you would know what caused it.<br>  <br>  Also, there is no correlation between a child's physical development and their ability to properly digest a variety of foods. I'm not saying that you shouldn't start him on baby food. I'm just saying that even if he is strong, healthy and appears to like the new food, it doesn't mean the food will like him.|`|GCSFnc4Haa	i started feeding my son jarred food at 2 1/2 months old AGAINST DR WISHES i know my son and he was an early developer he got his first tooth at 5 months!!  he had no problem eating it and always spit rice / oatmeal back out!! i usually just fed him about a half of stage 1 jar of food to start out!|`|UXhFcHCHaa	well my dr said to start rice at 4 months and wait till 6 months for baby food. well you tell a baby who was eatng all the cereals and still wanting a 10 oz bottle for all his feedings this. i went ahead and started him on baby food at 5 months. he loves it and it keeps him full. its not what i intended but he still drinks and 8 oz bottle.|`|VrPyp1APaa	I think it just depends on the child.  My son is 5 months old and at his 4 month check-up the Dr. told me to wait til 6 months and then start him on cereal.|`|x7vTKP24aa	my dr said wait till 6 months to offer any foods. he said baby doesnt need baby food yet and even after we start it baby should get all her nutritional needs from my milk|`|ME62Mtv4aa	5 months should be fine just limit the amounts you give him|`|EhGR05Etaa	I waited until 6 months to feed anything other foods other then cereal because the books and doctors said to wait until 6 months because their digestive system just isn't really ready before then, I don't think it's JUST the matter of when the baby is ready to eat food.  I don't think that foods would have a specific age if there wasn't a reason. It's up to you want you choose to do though...if it's not causing any problems then I wouldn't think it would be a problem...but I always talk to my doc first just to make sure there wouldn't be any long term damage to anything I do.  Just in case.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Some research is suggesting that you shouldn't start with cereal anymore but with bland fruits and veggies. The rice cereal thing is just how it has always been. I did start my kids on fruits nad veggies and 5 months because my pediatrician said it is okay as long as they have the reflexes to eat it. Everybody is different and a lot of times breastfeeding mothers wait longer to start solids. I think that your way works for you so go with it. My sister in law for example didn't even give her kids anything that wasn't from a jar until their first birthday, and when she did finally start letting them eat anything else the pieces were SO small that they couldn't eve get their little fingers to pick it up. Can you imagine a babies (9+ months) life without cheerios? IT worked for her though and made her feel better so it was good for them.|`|HvALvdc7aa	My daughter is 2 1/2 months and our Dr said to start the cereal. We have been putting it in her bottle to help with her reflux anyway but he said we could give her a tablespoon of it once a day from a bowl. She absolutely loves it. Shes messy ,but so cute. I thought it was kinda early for that ,but he said its not as long as she can tolerate it and she can. He told me we would start baby food at 5 months. I'm not sure where some people up here get their information. I just go by what the Dr says and my daughter is healthy and happy. Good luck with the jarred food.|`|nZVGUzZzaa	my doctor told me to wait till 6 months to start, my five year old was 3 months when i started the cereal and 4 months when i started the fruits and veggies, my 10 month old was 2 months old when he started the cereal, and at about 4 months old would eat anything put in front of him even if it wasn't for him. at about 6 months old he just stoped eating the baby food, he would only eat table food that i smashed up but left a little chunky and too this day he will not eat anything that resembles the texture of baby food, no yougurt, pudding, mashed potatoes unless a little chunky, his doctor said that this is just his taste preference and it was fine as long as i made sure he was getting a good helping of everything he needs.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i think the reasoning behind cereal first is bc  u control how thick or thin it is....once my dd started eating off a spoon, she wouldn't swallow runny stuff so we started jars too, i even have to thicken some of those for her liking; at 5.5 mos; ped gave go ahead for solids, so we started slow to not upset her tummy and she demanded like yours, still does if i am not fast enough, LOL|`|vue9NOhYaa	The only 'reasoning' is myth and tradition.  Solid food is solid food.  Rice cereal is no more digestable or less allergenic than jarred food.<br>  <br>  The tradition for starting with rice cereal began in the 1940's and 1950's ... when most babies were on home-made formula. Suchformulas were not nutritionally adequate, so babies needed solids very early to avoid anemia, scurvy and other illnesses.  Rice cereal was developed as an easy, cheap way of providing iron. (Before that time, babies were given egg yolk or beef broth for iron.)  It could be mixed very thin, and force fed to newborns and young infants  who could not eat really eat solid foods. <br>  <br>  Today, most babies are breastfed or fed commercial formula -- both of these offer complete nutrition for at LEAST 6-8 months, so there's no need to start any solids early.  If you do choose to give solids as early as 4 months, you can start with any simple food.  You WOULD want to limit the total number of foods he gets, since babies under  6 month are at high risk for allergy, but rice or peas or apples are all equally 'ok.'  The only benefit to rice is that it's very cheap, easy to mix in small amounts, and, because it tastes like nothing more than the milk it's mixed with, most babies will eat it. (They think it's just formula/breastmilk on a spoon.)
DKqsFGymaa	I like this site:  www.educationaltoysplanet.com|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I'm sorry, but I do my best to avoid the name brand, over priced "educational toys."<br>  <br>  Little kids learn from their parents every moment of their lives.  They don't need special toys or DVD's.  My 2 1/2 year old plays with things around the house, helps me stir dinner (we talk about steam and why we wash veggies first, etc.)  Then he can help me go down and do laundry, (we talk about water pressure, electricity, why the underground basement is colder then the upstairs.)<br>  <br>  Sure we have toys at home, but nothing that has an extra high price tag because somebody said it was "educational."  Everything a child touches can be educational.  It just depends if you want to teach, or if you want something (a toy) to teach for you.|`|Kq4usVUTaa	You are the best learning toy!!!  Just by interacting with your toddler you teach him so much more than any toy could!  I never bought my daughter any of the so-called educational toys because they're so darn expensive!  We did, however, invest in a chalkboard.  I would write letters, draw shapes, write numbers and draw pictures of things.  By the time my daughter was 2 she knew all the letters in the alphabet, numbers 1-20 and shapes, all from the chalk board!  Puzzles are also fun.  Start with the ones with the wooden shapes cut out, then progress to the interlocking pieces.  Picture books are awesome too!  Talk about what's going on in the pictures in addition to reading the story.  Trips are also fun... go out into nature, the grocery store, or wherever and point out objects, talk about them and name their color.|`|kmQqbxpQaa	Fisher-Price? Fun 2 Learn?

1tmX7xbRaa	at the moment my daughter is almost 19 months and she loves playing by herself (she is and only child but only for a few more months im due in may with #2). like your son she can be very sociable around other people and children... has no problem getting along with them but when we are home together she would much rather be by herself then have me play with her. god knows i try but usually she just gets annoyed with me and moves on. i think it's normal. i think my daughter (and possibly your son) is like this for a few reasons: 1. she wants to be independent 2. im here with her all day so she is sick of me 3. she has an active imagination <br>  i wouldn't be worried.pediatrician|`|NqAzcrtsaa	tell him to move out and get a job.|`|AA10063059	my 6 year old grandson is just the same and always has been,he loves socializing but doesnt mind being on his own all day|`|7ach0Dz5aa	I feel the same way about my 3 year old.

So the reason he talks less maybe because his sensitivity to language has been starved, which means children are very curious beings and if we adults do not see to these sensitivities at the correct time he lacks it.  We must always take time to listen to children encourage language and you will see a difference for example if you carry children all the time or restrict his movements the child will take time to be steady on his feet and walk.  As to him wanting be on his own is because you seem a very busy mum and when his need to be curious has been stunted, try talking to him often make him understand that yu are busy but have time to listen to him, re assure him, and there should be a change, talking and explaining to them does work as they do understand.

Sounds like tons of fun and a memory to treasure!|`|EUTRJqCsaa	my family always had a regular sized cake for guests and then a small round one for the baby...that way they had their own personal cake they could destroy =).|`|ECQwlHfKaa	Let him tear it up--that's the fun part about it!|`|koaVQVnJaa	Let him do whatever he wants to it and video tape it. It will be great fun!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	let him destroy, makes for great pics!|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	awww, congrats!! What you can do is buy him (or bake him) a mini cake, just the size of a personal pizza. Get him down to his diaper and let him go to town on it. After he's got enough icing in his hair and up his nose (get the camera ready for this!!) take him straight to the tub. have a regular sized cake for the guests. Have fun!!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	for my daughters first birthday what i did was got a half a sheet cake and cupcakes from the bakery for the guests (cupcakes for the kids) and she blew the candles out on the nice cake. then i made a cake just for her to destroy. i did both so that everyone could have cake AND my daughter got to make a mess. the pictures of her playing in her cake are something i wouldn't trade. i would definitely recommend something for the guests and something for the baby to play in|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	My Daughter just turned a year on Friday...and I made a small 4" cake just for her, and I let her rip into it...se hardly ate any of it, but a few dabs here and there of the frosting..But we removed her clothes and sat her on the table and let her go for it..I say make a small one, less work and then make one for everyone else to enjoy...That's what I did.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Why not bake him his own mini cake?  Reserve some of the extra batter, or make some extra, and bake it up in a loaf pan, or a square pan, or even one round pan and call that his cake to destroy, rather than giving him a whole cake and wasting all of that food?|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Instead of baking an extra cake for the guests, I'd have a big cake for the guests, and let him have his own little one. That way everyone gets cake AND he gets to destroy his! The mess is sooo worth it though!

4sjW4Ig5aa	Sounds like he may have speech delay. That is very frustrating for the child. Picture you have all these wants, needs, ideas, etc with no real way to communicate, it's very hard on the child, and as a result, they tend to have some anger issues until they start talking.<br>  <br>  I'd have him evaluated, were he mine, and see about starting speech therapy. The sooner the better. My brother had speech delay, started speech therapy at alittle before 3, and came out of it for the better. My son had speech delay, started speech therapy at 3, and talks beautifully and too much 9 years later.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine has a son that is 10 now, suffered speech delay, they never got him therapy. And he still can't talk right. Very sad. <br>  <br>  This isn't something to be put off.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	No offense intended here, but instead of trying to figure out what's wrong with him, he needs to be evaluated by a dr. Of course it's not normal and instead of letting it continue, please get that baby some help!|`|M2yERqNSaa	could be autism or he might have rage problems, he needs to be evaluated by child developmental agency.<br>  <br>  I have friends with autistic children, some are prone to violence but some aren't|`|0XzpNuvOaa	It's hard to say what "normal" is. Each person develops at a different pace. My daughter spoke in complete sentences at that age but I know of other kids who did not. He could speak but may he just doesn't want to, or he could just be a late talker. <br>  <br>  My daughter has a cousin who is autistic, even before he was diagnosed his mom said something was wrong or different with him. He would not look you in the eye (even at 2 or 3) and his eyes would often go off to the side. Walked on tiptoes and his fingers/hands curled up. He didn't even say "mommy" until he was around 3. He would repeat the same lines over and over but could not respond to questions or give normal answers. He could recite an entire episode of a cartoon but could not put 3 words together in a sentence. <br>  <br>  Best thing to do is take him to the doc. He is now around 7 and in a normal classroom. His parents would with him hours each day  and have him in karate which has helped him focus.|`|grifjdr0aa	He needs to have a psych eval....<br>  <br>  <br>  He's probably pissed cuz they named him after the poop chute.
3w7VztEWaa	Yes they are trying to brainwashing us thro those commercials that high fructose corn syrup is good for us in moderation but it's not. It should be avoided at all times.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	Actually....... YES! <br>  <br>  Also, immunizations seem to be causing autism also. Why? the same reason that I gave you in the other answer about high fructose corn syrup. When I have  children they are not going to get immunizations because I know a lot of them are not needed and ALL of them are poisoned with something. Mercury perhaps! Anyways, be careful with immunizations, it's smart to skip them altogether.|`|CdGNZxLTaa	<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0616-31.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0616...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ashcraftandgerel.com/thimerosal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ashcraftandgerel.com/thimeros...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/archive/2008/03/06/government-concedes-georgia-girl-s-autism-caused-by-vaccines.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerd...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/011764.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalnews.com/011764.html</a><br>  <br>  Correct...some of the vaccines are NOT needed. So why give them.  The MMR is also dangerous, I believe , because it is too many at once. <br>  <br>  Aunt of an autistic nephew|`|PAhdlQ5eaa	It's a conspiracy I tell ya...A CONSPIRACY!!|`|N5mSDe1Naa	The problem with your theory is that we all exposed to mercury on some level. Mostly all of us have had the MMR shot and we all do not have autism. <br>  <br>  Autism is a very complex developmental disorder that appears in the first 2-3 years in a child's life. There have been countless studies to the cause of the disorder, but many have found that it is pure genetics that play a huge factor. I work with special needs children/adults and have a large population of children and adults with autism. Many of my clients have siblings or cousins with autistic traits. <br>  <br>  As far as autusitc traits "disappearing" because of certain foods. Stop listening to people like Jenny McCarthy. She is not educated in Autism research and has no business spreading info like that. Children will devlelop autism way before they even begin eating high fructose crap. <br>  <br>  I believe you can enhance a child or adults quality of life with the proper diet and by working with them on a daily basis, but in no way shape or form does autism go away. I have worked with people with the disorder for 8 years now. Their lives have been improved by working on their interactions with peers and by sticking to a routine. <br>  <br>  We are seeing more cases of autism due to the fact that people have become more aware of autism and other developmental disorders. It was only 20-30 years ago that someone with any sort of cognitive delay or disabilty would be institutionalized. Now we know the signs and can treat it early on which is why the numbers have increased and why the spending on treatment has increased. <br>  <br>  Last week this very case went to court and it was ruled that vaccinations and Mercury were not the cause of this disorder. While I'd love to discuss the possible conspiracies that occur in our government for hours, unfortunately I do not think there is much truth in this one. You are entitled to your feelings and thoughts, just as those who believe evolution and global warming are a joke. <br>  <br>  And the politically correct term is child/adult/person with Autism. By saying autistic child you are implying that they are defined by autism, when they have the disorder. It does not make up who they are. I know many high functioning and low functioning individuals with autism and I can assure you they are far more than just autistic.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	It could be.<br>  <br>  When you ask any question suchs as "could this be ..."  a likely response is yes.  However, I do find the specifics of this interesting, and dont doubt it.|`|wnzK56fiaa	I just spent over 6,000 dollars to get my poisonous fillings replaced and now I can't drink cokes! I hate these people!|`|AA11247439	The reason why the diagnoses rate for autistic spectrum disorders have been going up is due to more awareness of autism for 1,& 2 due to the broadening of the diagnostic criteria. there are many children being diagnosed today as autistic who 30 years ago would be diagnosed as either "mentally retarded", Childhood Schizoprenia, and also many who would have slipped through the cracks and been just considered odd, slow, and/or crazy. Also in more recent years such as the late 80s & early 90s some have been misdagnosed as severe ADHD and/or OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder )|`|Ca8i226Xaa	Yes, our environment has been polluted by harmful chemicals, toxins, and estrogens for generations, and we are seeing the result of it in birth defects and disorders like Autism. Also, men are more effeminate than they were 40 years ago, and some of that is because of so many estrogens in our environment.|`|kYVSmZy3aa	the lab is called the Philadelphia compound.  the drug knox down :<br>  Alzheimer's; retardation ; autism some form's.  look at Crimason 22#.|`|eytlIKITaa	You didn't mention that the levels of mercury found in these foods are 3--300% less than that found in fish/shell fish....
ESAM0U7xaa	yes, i did! it's a lot more work than you may think and you need to think really hard before doing so. you have to go to many appts and give yourself shots daily. it takes several week to complete and there is a surgery involved to retrieve the eggs ( they did put me to sleep). it will put your body thru a bit and throw your hormones off. i was very bloated and looked a few months preggo at one point. <br>  i started looking in to it because of the pay, but what got me thru it was knowing what i was giving someone else!<br>  i wouldn't do it again, but very proud of myself for doing it the first time. u don't even get paid until it's all over...my whole process took about 3 months. <br>  i would also research online, go to the consultation and they will tell you everything there.  :)|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Hi there!  personally I have never done it but I do know about it.  The money is good but you have to go through a few months of giving your self hormone injections which can not be fun.  Retrieving the eggs is quite painful and you will have to be sedated.  You must be under 29 years old and of healthy weight.  You must know your family's medical history of any illnesses.  Personally even though your first time you may make $6,000.00 it is not worth it.  You have to go through a lot to become a donor.  Good luck hun<br>  <br>  This is just a random site about donation.<br>  <a href="http://www.fertilityconnections.com/pd/overview.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityconnections.com/pd/o...</a>|`|AA10747002	All I really know about it is that the cutoff is around 30 or something and you cant smoke or drink and you have to be very healthy. You can make very good money from this and help out a family that wants a child desperately. You can get way better info tho by doing a simple internet search.
pXSKSS3daa	Nothing much! Noah was sick with a 101-102 fever all weekend long so we were busy with that. He's much better today, thankfully.<br>  <br>  We did rent a movie Saturday night, though, and watched that after Noah went to bed.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I went to my Mom's house. She lives 2 hours away and I see her once a month. While I was there some of my old high school friends came over. I also had to get fitted for a bridesmaids dress for my brother's wedding.

Then we went to a pet store to show our son the animals.  Then we went to Pawn America and got some movies, came home, I made some salmon steaks, we kicked back and watched our movies. <br>  <br>  Nothing too extravagant for us, but definitely enjoyable, we love just being together!  <br>  <br>  what did you do this weekend?  :)
deIzFnV8aa	Could she be going through a growth spurt? Prob about the right age.  Each time that happened my DD nursed a bit more often so she could eat a bit more, but my milk supply got kind of over excited and made _a lot_ more for a few days. I would leak and feel full all the time for a few days, then things would settle down again.<br>  <br>  As far as pumping goes, you might want to either wait or just pump a little bit, perhaps emptying the breast after baby is done. Definitely don't pump between feedings, ,because you are right, your body will think that you have a bigger demand and make even more supply.  If you just want to pump enough milk for cereal, I assume we are talking a couple oz a day maybe. I think you can safely pump that now w/o really increasing your supply at all (esp since baby is so much more efficient than a pump).  Pumping that amount muight help you feel more comfortable, esp in the morning when most women are more full|`|hY5mMi90aa	Sometimes we make too much milk; if u drink excessively durring day or as our babies get older they don't need as much milk; but cereal  & such it may seem the baby is nursing the same; but she may not be taking in as much.  She is ready for solid foods and it is natures way of telling u.  Eventually your milk supply will decrease, also there are ways to slow the milk down; go to web MD.com & put in breast feeding or milk production durring nursing.  There will be answers to your questions on nursing.  Your dr. will or can give a med to slow milk process. wearing a tight bra will slow production too.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	my best advice is bump what you think is enough and store it and stop it will try up and stop leaking if it dont you might want to see a dr. but my sister she still has milk and her son is 16 yrs old it dont leek its just there hope it works for you good luck|`|JFbWyKKDaa	Pump extra... then if you want to go out sometime, your baby will have food instead of not having enough.|`|4Kf3GtBjaa	this happened to me a lot too.  i told my doctor if i could start pumping because my breasts would get huge and i started to feel pain. he told me it was called engorgement or something like that but he recommended me not to pump a lot because like you said it would increase the milk supply. so i think you should wait because your body will recognize that your baby is still eating the same amount and it will even it out.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Fill glad that you have more instead of having not enough, I would just pump so that you can have extra just in case but that is just me though.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	You may be eating or drinking something that is increasing your supply, or her suck my have changed. At that age their suck gets stronger and that can increase your supply too. I used to nurse on one side and pump on the other to use for cereal. Obviously you can't do it every time but when you are alon with her in the house why not? I usually did it once or twice a day and froze the extra. Your supply will even out soon and if you pump this way you won't be increasing the demand at all.

7at1Hyn8aa	Absolutely normal.  Kids do all kinds of things.<br>  When my son got upset with something he would stand in front of me and hold out his arms like he wanted to give me a hug, then tense his arm, neck, and head muscles and distort his face.  He was just absolutely stiff from the belly up.  He did this for almost a year, I guess he really liked how it felt.<br>  Trust me, she is just fine.  If you are still worried mention it at her next check-up.|`|5snO0Yngaa	If you try and do this yourself - you actually can!<br>  I think this is normal!<br>  I just did it!<br>  If you are not sure about anything - just go visit your local doctor and have a chat.<br>  I am sure they will tell you that all is fine.|`|ocD3kv5oaa	Oh yea, my kid does it all the time.

MAbqM6aEaa	If possible, see if anyone can go to the airport with you and ask when you check in for them to get a gate pass to help assist you.  They let people do this, especially those with kids and the elderly.  Definitely see if someone can MEET you at the TX airport and ask for the same thing.  That way, you don't need to worry about lugging the carseats by yourself.  Also, do not hesitate to ask for help; you'd be amazed at how many people are willing to lend a hand to you, especially other parents who have been there and done that so they KNOW what you're going through.|`|6PfJXI7iaa	WOW!! Yep been there done that.  The first time I flew I had my parents with me and it was still overwhelming and LONG!!  The double stroller is a must!  I had 1 heavy and bulky car seat which I needed to keep my little guy in his seat.  The older one, I just let him sit in a regular seat on the plane and checked in the booster seat.  My boys sleep with Teddy's so on the plane as we took off I gave them to them for a distraction.  I also brought gum, suckers, jellybeans, books, crayons  just in case one had a meltdown I could bring out something different.  I also brought a portable DVD player with their favorite movies.  Keep some bottled water in your carry-on bag with a P&J sandwich just in case one is hungry.  I would just make a list of things you need on the plane and it should be fine.  Good luck!!!!|`|UaOxV97waa	try putting them in coach and you in first class<br>  im sure it would be a lot easier for you|`|AA11604591	When I flew they allowed for any car seat that properly fit into the seat on the plane. The double stroller will be taken from you right at the gate and they will take it out and put it on the plane and then pull it out for you again once you have landed. Make sure you have plenty of activities. color wonder markers and paper are great because they cant make a mess anywhere else, if you are going to be on the plane for a bit take a fun snack for them, get some marshmallows, goldfish crackers, pretzel sticks, other dry snacks they might like and make them their own special goodie bags. If you have any toy cars or small toys that they ALWAYS love to play with i would take those too. books are always good to read out to them and if someone else doesnt like you reading outloud to your babies, just remember its better than them getting impatient and screaming the whole time. Good luck mama you should do great

I'm a runner too and my kids are constantly asking me to run around the block with them, it's obvious they want to be like their parent..... so he'll probably have a natural leaning towards it anyway. It's when parents get OBSESSIVE and drive their kids too hard too young. You can push or "nudge" but always leave the door open for them to opt out, or accept them just the same if it doesn't work out or if they want to be the next Billy Elliott. Unless you're Tiger Woods pushing too hard rarely works out.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Well I think of it this way, as long as my kid is participating in an active activity then I am good.  We tried soccer, and it was very hard on us as a family because of the two nights of practice plus one game a week, not to mention all the other things we have going on.  My son is now in TaeKwonDo and he has said he is bored with it, but we've talked about him keeping up with it until he has his black belt.  (the other day I caugh him practicing his form, so I know he's still got some interest in it)  I think it is important for him to learn how to finish through with something he has started.  I told him once he gets his black belt he can try something else, as long as it is physically active because that's good for his body and spirit.|`|vRU60aSsaa	I don't see anything wrong with that. It's when people start forcing the issue, is where the problem comes. You have to consider his personality not be the same and he just isn't into like you guys. Support him in whatever is his niche and he'll love you for it.|`|lH29UxtSaa	nudging him towards a particular sport would be fine however it should just be nudge an if he doesnt enjoy it dont push him|`|im3vWyv6aa	I'm a nudger... sports are very important to us as a family. I have nudged my children to try every sport available to them. They have to stick it out the entire season, but if they don't like it they don't have to play next year.<br>  <br>  I am on a committee that coordinates the sporting events for our elementary children. My children have played basketball, volleyball, softball, soccer, swimming and this year we are going to offer tennis for the first time. So far my children are very athletic and love to play everything. With the exception of my 8 year old daughter... she didn't like softball so she isn't going to play this year.<br>  <br>  My 12 year old is going to try track this year... this is the first year it's been available to her.<br>  <br>  Best wishes...<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|hKJIDdVqaa	my boys are very athletic, playing football, baseball, fall baseball, basketball, and ju jit su.  They love sports and it takes up most of their time, they maintain high honor averages also.  Nothing wrong with encouraging him to try out something new.  With our younger son he was 8 at the time he wanted to play football, then wanted to quit, we made him stick it out and I am glad I did, he loves it.  However where we live you start most sports at age 8 and baseball at age 5.  They are conditioning for the high school years.  It is hard to get on a sports team in our area at the age of 12. But hey if you can get him on one I say go for it.|`|AA11210211	I don't think it would be wrong to "nudge" him in that direction but you shouldn't force him or get mad at him if it turns out he doesn't like it,I think all children should try everything at least once and if they don't like it then so be it,but they should still try.We plan to try everything with our son and our daughter and if they don't like them then we will keep trying other stuff until they do find what they like.|`|AA11209233	Definitely nudge him.  It would be better if you waited for him to show an interest first and then nudge him, but you never know what hangups are going through a kids mind that would stop him from asking you to get him into a sport he likes.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Let him do what he wants.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Yes
ggfE4rlvaa	Yes, you can totally blame it on pregnancy. I turned into a raging ***** with my second pregnancy. also, had ZERO patience. Kinda took a lot of it out on my partner. I feel really bad about it now. ;(|`|sAbah6dTaa	definately have... not good when you have a three year old, but i try to keep my cool.<br>  <br>  i'll fall asleep on the couch and my husband tells my daughter to go see if i'm awake (to annoy me of course) and she has to get right in my face and say "mommy are you asleep?" ... drives me insane, i'm soo cranky when i first wake up!! and having hot flashes, that's driving me insane too!!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	People have told me that pregnant women develop "nesting" habits, and that it gets most extreme towards the end of pregnancy.  That is when you want your home ("nest") to be the most ideal/comfortable for you and your baby.  That sounds like what happened with you and the shades today!  I'm almost at my due date and have been obsessed with washing dishes and keeping the fridge and cupboards stocked and in order.  Also I stayed up to the wee hours doing laundry that I could have put off for the next day, just because I was paranoid that the baby would want to deliver at any time now.  So yeah, you can blame it on your pregnancy!|`|m8aqAZgJaa	Oh Yeah I am losing patience with everyone. I can barely make it through my work day without my blood boiling. I feel like I am going to snap at anytime and for some reason everyone has to make stupid comments about nothing that just irritate me. I feel bad for my husband no matter what he does it just isnt right to me. The other day I had a complete meltdown because I thought that he was trying to get to the bathroom before me. It turned out that he was just turning on the light so I could see where I was going. Good thing I am almost due!!!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	LOL i do stuff like that all the time!! I cant wait to not be pregnant anymore...sometimes i feel like a monster. I get very irritated with the most stupid thing...such as if i am cooking dinner and the chicken isnt done when i think  its going to be.....i get myself all worked up and have to go take a nice warm bath and think to myself what a tart i am lol.....i blame the hormones, other wise i am a very nice person lol.
9Ng5sqpnaa	Below are a couple of links I found interesting - one which speaks to the original founders and donors of the NCFA - everyone seems to choose to remain anonymous. <br>  <br>  Below that is a list of agencies that belong to the NCFA - of course the largest is the Gladney Home in Tx. There are a large number of Bethany Christian Services and LDS agencies as well - - all invested heavily in keeping the records closed so that they can guarantee privacy to the aparents.<br>  <br>  I mention this because I heard Bill Pierce at two conferences in the late 1980's making these same ridiculous comments about feeling compelled to protect the privacy of mothers. Several first mothers including myself and others addressed him publicly and privately about the fact that we never requested anonymity for privacy from our children - it was imposed upon us and in fact, many of us including myself were told that our children would be given our contact information once they were 18, if they requested it. I lived 18 years waiting for that day and it wasn't until it passed that I learned that the records in PA had been closed in 1984 - up to that point they had been open.<br>  <br>  This tired old arguement of theirs is so outdated. How dare they speak for mothers even after they've been told time and time again that their logic is erroneous!The NCFA for the most part, represents adoption agencies that do not wish to participate in openness and therefore they fight hard in every state with an open record bill to keep the records sealed. I believe the NCFA continues to lose any respect they may have once had because they are considered such a dinasour when it comes to progressive and open adoption practices. <br>  <br>  The only purpose I can think of for issuing this newest diatribe against openess is desperation. The Donaldson Institute also represents adoptive parents and agencies but they are now perceived to be on the cutting edge of ethical adoption practices. I am not agreeing with everything they stand for either, but they are at least perceived to have the best interest of the child in mind.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://library.adoption.com/articles/the-richard-c.-stillman-foundation-for-adoption.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.adoption.com/articles/the...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.adoptioncouncil.org/agency/documents/DirectoryofMemberAgencies-May302008.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptioncouncil.org/agency/do...</a>|`|3X4i5Whvaa	NCFA keeps coming out with the "same old, same old." <br>  <br>  Privacy is not the issue. Surrendering a child doesn't seal records nor change a child's name. Only adoption changes the name, and it is the adoptive parents and the gov't who do that.<br>  <br>  NCFA has used that tired old 1994 study of underage adopted children to back up its "findings" of what adopted people "want" and "how they are "doing.".The Minnesota Search Institute Study issued questionnaires to underaged teenaged adoptees who were living at home. The kids filled out the answers, presumably at home...with their adoptive parents nearby.<br>  <br>  Zappala's article points out the very low rate of "reunion" with natural parents..well, yeah...when the kids are in closed adoptions and they are underage..what can one expect...<br>  <br>  NCFA trickery..again.<br>  <br>  ETA: Actually, the theft of identities and the falsification of birth certificates by the gov't could be called a 'violation of privacy" of both the natural mother and the child. Privacy rights are not imaginary, they are real, and are a right contained in the 4th Amendment to the Constitution. Seizure of personal papers and identities are serious violations.Medical histories and records belong to people. Mothers and children have a relationship starting before birth.A birth certificate records this relationship at and after birth, and contains personal data..Falsifying a birth certificate is ordinarily against the law.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	I think the reason for it is that they know they are fighting a losing battle. <br>  <br>  They know that when they've opposed Bills to restore Adoptee Access to their own records, they have lost and they know that their theories and half-truths have been disproven (most notably in a Tennessee Court, which ruled that there was NO right to annonymity) <br>  <br>  They know that with each State that restores Adoptees' rights to their own birth records, (most recently in Maine) their case for perpetual secrecy gets weaker and weaker.<br>  <br>  If it hadn't been for them, Adoptees would have been restored to equal citizens Nationwide back in 1978.<br>  <br>  They're full of it.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	From what I have read over the years this has always been something that no one seems to have any real balance in. <br>  <br>  Mutual party consent is a good idea for an older generation that is unprepared for the way modern society works in relation to openness in adoption. One of our close friend's daughter (she was given up for adoption 25 yrs ago) wanted to meet him. But his wife wasn't ready to deal with it at the point since their son was having some issues relating to his own adoption and background. (It was done through mutual parties) What would have happened if she just turned up on his doorstep one day out of the blue? It could have disrupted his marriage and his children's understanding about reunion and what can come from it, because of the shock seeing her there. They would have all been emotionally unprepared for it. (they also have a son who's an adoptee.) Some people would do that. Turn up without notice and expect it all to turn out okay. <br>  <br>  I'd rather see more successful reunions than ones that end in more pain. Open records is what I'd like to see more of all over the world, but information is a form of power, and whats people do with it is what I think makes people worry about openness. (I still feel adoptee's have a right to know about their past and family, just has to be handled the right way.)<br>  <br>  Still times are changing.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	I certainly do wish they would pull out their Constitution and explain this mythical right to privacy.  Since they offer no explanation, I can only assume it is derived through Roe v Wade or public records laws.  Roe v Wade addresses reproductive rights, and in no way influences adoption laws.  Public records laws certainly do not protect parents.  Anyone can obtain a copy of their birth certificate which records the names of their parents--except, of course, persons who have been adopted.  Either way, I fail to see a parent's right to privacy.  <br>  <br>  And as for their identity argument, I am simply dumbfounded.  Apparently, their definition of identity and mine are mutually exclusive.  When someone speaks of having their identity stolen, they aren't complaining that they no longer have a sense of self.  They are speaking of their date of birth, social security number, etc.  The identity that has been withheld from adoptees has nothing to do with self-esteem or any other nonsensical notion.  It is factual information recorded by the state.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	NCFA needs to change their name to "Babies-R-Us".  Their corruption is coming to light, and their ideals are antiquated. Hopefully their days are  numbered.|`|zVZgYEjMaa	They want to keep records sealed, and keep adoptees as second-class citizens.<br>  <br>  I notice they offer no argument for their position, they simply object to the claims of others.  Without any positive argument for their position, I cannot imagine why anyone would believe a thing they say.  They throw the word "privacy" around as though it is magical.  Really, they aren't talking about privacy, they're talking about anonymity.  And they are talking about discrimination.  But those words don't get them what they want.|`|BTuFtui3aa	This seems like just a summary or reminder of their previously stated positions?<br>  <br>  I was under the impression that the NCFA had always overtly questioned open adoption and opposed making it legally enforceable.<br>  <br>  I'm not seeing anything in this statement in particular that the NCFA hasn't already expressed as their position. Apologies if you see something obvious and I'm missing it, but this seems like more of the usual?|`|OQnRP6xVaa	It's an old argument and hinges on:<br>  [quote]<br>  Systems based on the principle of mutual<br>  consent respect both the birth parents’ right to<br>  privacy and the adopted person’s desire to know<br>  his or her birth parents’ identities by protecting a<br>  birth parent’s identity when the birth parent desires<br>  confidentiality, and facilitating the exchange of<br>  identifying information when both sides consent<br>  to such an exchange.1[quote]<br>  <br>  Because:<br>  [quote]<br>  1. Such systems include mutual consent registries and confidential intermediary systems. Mutual consent registries are databases in which birth parents and adult adopted persons can register their names if they desire contact. If a “match” occurs, identifying information is exchanged. Confidential intermediary systems allow for one party to request the state to search for another party with the intention of making contact. Once the s Second party has been contacted by the state, he or she may consent to or deny the release of his or her identifying information to the first party.[quote]<br>  <br>  The reason this argument is made is because Many people assume that if the mother (parents) cannot place without the fear of discovery the parents will choose abortion instead....  <br>  <br>  This is just the debate--not my opinion|`|AA10705195	I know.

Vi8RDbhUaa	I would take the baby and go on the trip. Sure it would be better if you two were alone but in your situation it can't be done. So, since a 10 week old baby has no idea whats going on around them...let the Romance begin.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Guess what, you are a parent and are responsible for you children until they leave home.  'Romantic weekends' just are NOT in the future until ALL children are out of the house - that's just part of life.<br>  Or, unless you can find a very responsible/understanding grand parent to watch them all.<br>  My first husband and I never had 'romantic weekends'.  We were parents and had responsibilities - 3  children.<br>  I used to babysit my grand daughters (when my son and his wife had a day by themselves for their anniversary) but not until all were out of diapers.|`|HKKu4CjEaa	Is it not possible to have your mom or some relative give your baby it's milk from a baby bottle just for a weekend?  If not, I guess you'll have to take the kids with you.  Just the thought of being in Venice since it is such a romantic atmosphere might be enough to overshadow the fact that your kids are with you.  You could get them all to take a nap at one time during the day and just step out on your terrace or balcony and enjoy the refreshing air and view or you could make love QUIETLY.  Where there's a will, there's a way.  I know you've heard that cliche before.  Good luck.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	In my book romance and young babies just don't go hand in hand.....I waited till my youngest was 8 months old (and would finally take a bottle) and we ended up going out for a very fancy dinner!  I got all doodied up with fancy underwear and we had a wonderful night.
jaP0TANdaa	There are a few good sites to help you chart and take some of the guess work out of it since the computers will automatically calculate things for you. Some warning though, charting using BBT is harder than it seems (at least it was for me). You have to remember every morning to take your temp, and it has to be at the same time every morning... so even on your days off you have to wake up at least briefly to take your temp. You have to try to get at least three consecutive hours of sleep before taking you temp too. This messed me up a lot since I often would wake up and have to use the restroom a few hours before waking to temp! You can't eat, sleep, drink, move, NOTHING unti you take your temp. I used Vitex to help me with my cycles. I started taking 400mg in the morning and 400mg at night and it helped me ovulate sooner in my cycle and lengthened my luteal phase by two days. I have no idea about the EPO, but I've heard good things. I've also heard that you need to stop taking it after ovulation though. I'd say that if AF was 9 days early, then you probably did ovulate earlier than usual, which made AF come earlier than usual. Anyway, good luck to you and TONS of baby dust your way. I'm waiting on AF to show her ugly head any day now... though I really do wish she'd just go away and stay away for 9 months!|`|dCVVP3hmaa	Fertility Friend is the best site to chart.  I used this site (and still do) when I was ttc, and it was so informative.  It taught me heaps of things I didn't know.  There is a chat room, where you can talk to other fellow ttcers and fellow pregnant women, and a forum for questions with answers that have helped me heaps.  The best thing is that is is a really affordable site, and you meet heaps of women form around the world.  I would be lost without it!<br>  <br>  Evening Primrose oil is great for ttc - I took it for 2 months and got my bfp!  It increases cervical mucus, if you are lacking.  Another good herb for ttc is Vitex Agnus Castus - many women have got pregnant using this natural herb.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RPszYGXkaa	Use this site for charting:<br>  www.fertilityfriend.com<br>  <br>  It is a nice site and has a VIP upgrade for the first 30 days.  TCOYF also has a site....www.ovusoft.com, with a 14 day free trial, but after that its 40.00.<br>  <br>  I started charting two months ago, and it is really interesting.  Pay attention to your temp and your cervical fluid.  I also like the OPK's b/c the charts can tell you when you ovulated AFTER it happens (b/c you need 3 higher temps to confirm the o).  Your cervical fluid (CF) tells you when you are fertile, so when you see CF that is watery or like eggwhites (stretchy and shimmery), then you should do the BD. <br>  <br>  <br>  Best wishes and baby dust!!  PS - read the book cover to cover, I think it is hard to read just a section and bounce around, b/c it kind of goes in order.

All i can suggest is patience :)|`|KmC0K59taa	You need to be more in tune with your son.  There has to be a reason why he is crying.  If you are with him all day long, you should be able to see what sets him off.  Does he do it when he is tired or hungry?  Does he do it when he's in a good mood?  Does he do it only in public?  Maybe he is afraid of strangers and wants you to comfort him.<br>  <br>  Don't ever yell at him to stop crying.  Talk to him in a calm, reassuring voice.  If he's 4 he should be able to tell you what is wrong.|`|nyCW1Xt5aa	It is a faze my second child had it bad at that age. 1st i tolerated it and tried talking and asking him to stop then I watched Nanny 911 and she started putting the kids in time out over crying for no reason and so I did it and it worked and we started using our words when we got frustrated and didn't like something instead of crying. So when he starts the fit try calming him down and saying lets talk then if he continues to cry then its time out cause there isn't a reason for it and they do it for attention.|`|36fe86666bb74ff171bad4cb394de371aa	There are so many reasons!

Just to be on the safe side. But next time, I was told by a lactation consultant, that you can tell when the milk has gone bad by smelling it. If it smells foul, then obviously, throw it out..But I don't know the truth to that. Use your judgement or call your pediatrician's office. The nurses will help you if you ever have any questions or concerns. :)|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I would not use it!

So, if you are already a healthy eater, just listen to your body - believe me, it will tell you (it probably already has been telling you!) when you need a little extra. Lotsa fruit and veggies, carbs and protein. In addition to the healthy stuff DO not deny yourself treats! Stay away from alot of fast foods & pre-packaged foods.

We do not eat out a lot and I make a lot of home cooked dinner. I control what goes in to all of my dishes. I try and use organic when ever I can. I never buy normal eggs. They are always cage free and most of the time organic. I do indulge in sweets every night. I make cakes, cookies, and brownies once a week and that is our desserts every night. Eating desserts is a nasty habit I got in to this december on out vacation and I just can not kick it. I also try an walk my dog every day to help off set my bad cravings. I have bad cravings for soda, but I only drink it once a week on sundays. If, I did not limit it I would drink way too much soda. Just take you pre natal vitamins and don't eat out every day and your baby will be just fine!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I loveee fruit even more now that i am pregnant.

KmC0K59taa	I think this is just something that kids do on their own.  My best friend's daugther started biting her nails at 2 and noone else in her family does it.  The same thing with my niece who is 5. <br>  <br>  They make stuff that is in the nail polish aisle for this problem.  It's called No Bite or something similar.  It is brushed on the nails and it tastes bitter.  You might want to read the back of the package to see if their is an age limit.  You can also use this product for thumb suckers.<br>  <br>  If you don't want try that, give him to a toy to hold while watching TV.  Something to keep his hands busy.  Tell him not to bite his nails.|`|lxrayELJaa	My son started biting his nails when he was four.  It was horrible and there was NOTHING i could do to stop him.  I tried hot sauce, painted his fingers with over-the-counter meds, etc...all it did was make him scream bloody murder since his fingertips were raw.  I finally ignored it as much as possible and he stopped.  It could be a stress thing or maybe he's nervous.  You can never tell with kids.  Good luck.|`|WKt58GYLaa	Both of my kids had that habit around age 3.  It was weird, since neither my husband or myself do it, so I don't know where they got it from.  They eventually just stopped doing it.   <br>  <br>  You could try putting on that nasty tasting stuff that they make for thumb suckers.  Maybe that would help.  Lots of luck!|`|e8bRcVNAaa	PUT HOT SAUCE ON HIS HANDS BUT NOT TOO HOT.|`|rxjybUimaa	Hot sauce and smacking hands are bad ideas. No one wants to know that their mother is purposefully hurting them.<br>  <br>  Give him a toy he can work on. For example a rubix cube, a few transformers, the game Simon where the lights flash and you have to repeat the color pattern, a coloring book and crayons, a Leapster (GREAT educational games that are made for toddlers), etc.<br>  <br>  Make sure he washes his hands thoroughly and often. Colds, worms and other icky things are easily contracted from dirty hands, especially under the nails. Let him pick out his own nail brush at the store that he can use when he washes his hands and/or in the tub.<br>  <br>  Make him a part of taking care of his nails. Let him explore and understand how the nail clippers or file works, tell him how those are the items we use to keep our nails short, clean and handsome looking. Let him know how very handsome his hands look when they're taken care of properly.<br>  <br>  Don't make him feel bad about biting his nails. He might be doing it out of insecurity. Are things at home a little unstable? Where they rocky when he started the habit?|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Keep his nails short. Very short. And make sure he washes them often. I suppose he could wear mittens? I don't really think putting hot sauce on them is a very good idea... If all else fails just ask his pediatrician for advice.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	at the drug store they have this stuff that looks like clear nailpolish that you can paint the tips of his fingernails with that make them taste really bitter. After a day or two he wont try it again. It should be in the baby section.
gdW8rZt8aa	Straight, shoulder length or maybe a longer bob cut, with a light to medium brown.  It would look good with your color of eyes.  Good luck and have fun with it.  My fiance has seen me with all colors of hair.  I was always changing the color, then finally went back to blonde.  It is nice having something different once a year or so.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I understand wanting a change, I always get to that point as well, BUT, I really like your hair the way it is.  That red color fits your face and complexion perfectly!  It also seems you have naturally curly hair, its hard to reccommend a hair cut cause too short with curly hair and equal really bad!  <br>  I think it looks great the way it is though.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I like the color you have now under the New Pics section. It is very nice on you and your skin tone. I like the side swept bangs. Not too sure about cuts for curly hair though since mine is quite straight!|`|mI4lrKdHaa	This time you got like 3 answers. Oh sorry this doesn't count. RED.okay it counts like 3 now.|`|1Cnaphybaa	i really like the red.in the whole photo you look really pretty.leave it that way.congrats <3 peace xo|`|sdlvEMCjaa	I couldn't get your pix up. sorry.|`|FuR0RpCfaa	I would try either<br>  A. Leave it same color, long bangs, updo w/ringlets= room in awe<br>  B. Dark Chocolate, long bangs/no bangs, flat= cute, sexy, lots of work<br>  C. Medium Golden Blonde, no short bangs, trim bottom, mini braids from start of forehead/scalp and inch or two back n stop or whole thing.= completely different, lasts longer than updo.<br>  <br>  From seeing your pics I would say current color, long bangs, mini braids, trim bottom.|`|G6eBvDz8aa	im the one that just added you on myspace -- by the way -- i think dark chocolate brown with SOME red!! like a cherry chocolate.. i think thats what garnier frutis is called and its a GORGEOUS color!! :) and i dont think you should cut it toooo much i LOVE your curls.. would kill to have natural ones like that!!

Your stylist should be able to help you and work with your face shape and colouring as to what will suit you better.|`|eV6MHADQaa	I like the bangs but you have to live w/ the HAIR until u grow it out or get it done again that said keep it red nice b

xXnFx6qLaa	I try to.<br>  <br>  I've been the butt of people's jokes before (not talking about the trolls on here, lol) and it really doesn't feel good.  A certain person *really* hurt my feelings once, someone who I considered family.  I was devastated.<br>  <br>  And yes, I do plan on teaching my son to do the same.|`|AA11210211	I do most of the time unless it is something I feel passionate about and I have had my moments,See a lot of my life I was always on the other side of the street,people never looked at what they were saying to me and looked at how it affected me and people always judged me so I know this first hand and I don't want my children to be those nasty kind of people also I don't want them to be on the other side of the street either I want them to be able to stand up for themselves.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	yes I always think before I speak, everything I mean to say and type I do, and I have thought about it before doing so.  Yes, I teach my children to do the same thing.  Do they always follow suit? No of course not, they are children and children lack impulse control (lol so do most adults.)|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I try to, anyway.  And, I hope that I'm teaching my children to do the same and to apologize if they make a mistake & forget to do so.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I don't say a lot of ridiculous, nasty things.  I don't look at my own situation, but rather I try to see things from the other persons point of view.  I try to teach my children to be open minded and accepting that other people are different.<br>  <br>  I am however a little impatient with lack of common sense and have a hard time understanding how some people can be totally lacking in that area.  So maybe sometimes I say insensitive things in that regard, but mostly because I want my kids to have common sense, so I point out the lack of it in others as a way to tell them, "Don't do that"|`|6PhSENcXaa	I was strictly brought up to think before I speak, and to keep my mouth shut if I have done the same thing.   If your guilty of it don't say anything at all.<br>  And I have 8 kids and they all know to stop and think before running off your mouth.  And to be careful anyways because you never know who's around and if their related to the person that your judging.  <br>  Not always easy but it's the best way.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	speak no i have a big mouth and smart mouth.  i've had to try and cover it way too many time in my life.  now as for typing - yea i do. i'm more muted on here believe it or not. :-)<br>  but i don't say real nasty thing anyways.  i'm not mean.<br>  i would never encourage my kids to be nasty or try and intentionally hurt someones feelings.  i would hope that i can teach them to not react w/out thinking.  thats kinda my worst fault in speaking.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	I try to, but sometimes its hard. <br>  I try to think of all scenarios.<br>  Yes.|`|j2mRop0laa	I try really hard but sometimes I forget.<br>  My daughter hardly ever thinks before speaking so we definitely work on that!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i definitely try. it's not always easy to keep my anger in check (especially now that im pregnant).|`|1s3nddaYaa	sometimes i stop to think of what i am saying. but when im really mad at something  i dont|`|SnQvsOPwaa	This is the one place I don't. At least I don't swear.|`|AA12145826	Yes I do. I also withhold nasty ridiculous comments (and then release them on a few choice trolls on here...mwahahahaha!). I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that my situation is far from ideal and thus I must not pass judgment too quickly on some (however I do suffer from letting my judgment "age" a little bit and it still being too quick!). I try to teach Hannah to think before speaking but at 6, she doesn't have that mental "speed bump" just yet.|`|AA11481889	God why should we stop at thinking just before we speak??<br>  <br>  I think with society the way it is...we should be teaching our kids to think...period...end of sentence.<br>  <br>  There seems to be a whole lot less thinking going on than there used to be.<br>  <br>  I think it's important not just to contemplate the repercussions of our words...but also our actions.<br>  <br>  People have forgotten about responsibility and accountability...of that, I will teach and remind my son.|`|f1nX6thdaa	My brother was in a terrible accident that left him with permanent brain damage.  He was in a car with three of his friends, all were drunk, even the driver.  There were no other cars envolved. Everyone of them almost died. It was a very stupid decision and everyone involved was very lucky to say the least.  When the newspaper printed the article online, people blogged the most horrible things. Most of it being that they all should have died. Or that they hope the boys will die.  They were in a coma for a long while. <br>  It blew my mind.  But, who cares.  It's just someone elses opinion. And 99 percent of the people who sit in saftey behind their computer screen would NEVER be brave enough to say it to their face. To go to my brothers room in the hospital and see his broken 19 yr old body and tell him as a machine breathes for him, that they hope he dies and rotts in hell.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	Depends on who I'm talking to and what mood I'm in.  I know my daughter will probably be like me and not hold her tongue and say exactly what she feels but I don't pass judgment on people without first looking at my own situation.  I just voice my opinion freely.|`|ZLwbmUr9aa	I try and think but anger clouds your regular thought process and thus sometime times thinking ahead is pointless. I do however have a fairly good judgment processes and now that I am out of high school I often find I don't even consider being mean to someone for no reason.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I always think before I speak, or type.  Speaking your mind is one thing...but you can always get your point across tactfully.  Some people fail to remember that little thing called 'tact'.  And yes, I plan to raise my son and my future children to 'think before they speak' just as I was raised.|`|GpR5MI5raa	i try to. and i especially try not to say nasty things to people. i dont like regreting what i've said.|`|xieiM0FRaa	Yes, I do.<br>  Or, I try very hard to.<br>  And I WILL teach my kids the same thing, only I don't have any yet.|`|28QPS6V9aa	Yes I do.

So, I think its funny . (this is an example.)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: You're being judgmental there, asking the question then responding with childish bull.

I'm generally a nice person so I don't usually get nasty or say hurtful things though.  (Just very outspoken, lol.)<br>  <br>  <br>  ***I just typed a nasty comment for a troll who likes to stalk me and my friend but her question was gone when I tried to submit it.

Agh!|`|jLYTKr33aa	As others have said, it's a very old riddle and the answer is that the mother is the doctor.  Don't feel bad about not knowing it.

HclKftzAaa	i am in australia. At the hospital where i'll be giving birth, they encourage breast feeding, but also provide one-use disposable bottles of formula for women who aren't going to be breast feeding.<br>  <br>  I would recommend maybe ringing them and asking them. Or at the very least taking some pre-steralised bottles, with pre-boiled/cooled water in them. And a tin of formula. This way you can make up plenty of formula if you need to (at room temp). And then get your partner to take used ones home and re steralize/refill them.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	hiya im not in kent but im pretty sure u do not need to take milk & bottles<br>  they provide a;l that that may change if u there for a long stay but in the UK ive never heard of anyone taking their own milk and bottles they have ready made bottles that get chucked away after use<br>  they may even give u some to take home if u havent any home ready for baby ( they did my cousin!)<br>  <br>  cant help with anything else though good luck x x|`|V2BlnZf0aa	I haven't given birth there but I would recommend you call them and ask.  Usually hospitals provide bottles of milk and individual teats that you attach to the bottle.  The are sealed and you just get as many as you need.<br>  <br>  Speak to your midwife or local GP if you have any questions at all.  You should also be offered a tour of the maternity unit so you can ask lots of questions.  They are used to it and ask no matter how trivial you think it is.  Congratulations and good luck x|`|ps11uX4Naa	hiya,<br>  i didnt give birth in Darent Valley but i do live in Kent and i had my girls in Medway Maratime Hospital they did supply the milk so i would of thought Darent Valley would as well, id double check with your midwife at your next app tho, <br>  <br>  ive heard alot of stories from people that have given birth there some good and some bad, all i can say is  Medway hospital doesnt have the best reputation but both times i was in i had great experiances and i ended up having an emergancy caesarean with my first and an elective with my second, so i wouldnt really listen to any stories you hear,<br>  <br>  good luck i hope your birth goes well and you have a happy healthy baby xxx|`|9EgWyiNbaa	Best to just ring up and ask..all health trusts have different policys.Give breastfeeding a go,you never know you might enjoy the experience.My gf tried but due to him being v poorly for a while she dried up but that did mean we could share everything to do with our little "devil" Good luck and enjoy your bonding time whichever method you choose.
3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	Didn't you just ask this question 4 hours ago?  You had like 11 answers on it too...<br>  <br>  You need to sit down and go over your finances with your fiance and figure out what you can and cannot afford to do.  If you can afford to stay at home, then by all means, do!  If you can't, then get a part-time job.|`|7jdvcrTKaa	I say that if you wanna get married, go ahead and do it.  Whether you have a small wedding with just a few of your friends and family members or decide to just go to the courthouse and later have a nice reception you will still be seen as being married in the eyes of God without having a big wedding.  As for deciding whether or not to find a part time mom or stay at home with the kids and the dog, I would say just enjoy your time that you have right now at your job and don't stress about anything because when you start to stress that's not good for the baby.<br>  <br>  If your fiance is making good enough money where you guys don't have to stress about the bills when you go on maternity leave, then stay at home with the kids for a little while.  Just put things in God's hands and if you do end up needing to work after your maternity leave is over then do so, with the babies in mind and not just because you HAVE to, but because you guys want the BEST for them.  Hope that was some good advice.  Good Luck and Congrats on the new lil one.|`|jtvFoIfhaa	i met my husband when i was 17 and he was 24. we new from the start we wanted to marry each outher but we though oh get married in a year or so then a few years later have a baby. well a few months later we found out we were pregnant! then when i was 5 months pregnant we went to the courthouse, got married and it was wonderful. yes its not the big white bedding but to us we had eachouther and i love him and he loves me. some of his family was even there. when she was born we both worked opisit shifts so one of us could be with her, then i soon found out i was pregnant again! i contniued to work and he also continued to work and go to college to! he graguated from college 1 month before our outher little girl was born   ( our girls are 17 months apart) after she was born i stayed at home with them and we decided that was best, for me to be a at home mommy and wife. then 11 months after she was born we found out we were pregnant again! we then new we needed a bigger place, we bought a house ( had a house built) and soon after our son was born. now he is 1 year! we have been together for 5 years and married for 4 1/2 years! we love our life and as we look back we would not chang how we got married at all! so you can do the fancy marrege are a smaller one. whatever you choose jsut put your heart to it and it can be done. also if you choose to be a at home mom then just look at your budget and see if you can do that financhaly, if it can be done (even if you have to take out a few unnessasery spending) it can be done! i know when all 3 are in all day school i then will go back to work

I started showing really quickly in my pregnancy as well.  I am 5ft tall too and was 111 pounds and my tummy started showing VERY early on.  =)  How cute of your tummy!!!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Part of that growth is baby the other part is bloating. It's fine and normal, you're not too big. Don't judge yourself on how big your stomach gets, watch your overall weight. I feel like my stomach has got a big basketball on it, but I can't stop loosing weight so just because you're stomach is getting bigger doesn't mean you are gaining too much. Good luck to you!|`|7iMZ91K7aa	Awww I love your little belly! I think you look normal.. When my friend was pregnant, she didn't start showing until she was nearly 6 months!

I'm sure if your doctor is concerned then you should be, but since he is not concerned and thinks everything is going well, then everything is GREAT!!!<br>  <br>  Besides you have such a small frame so you will be showing a lot sooner than heavier women.!!!!<br>  <br>  Keep us posted hun!!!!

Don't worry, everyone shows at different times and although it may appear you are bigger than normal now and it will probably appear that way at 40 weeks as well, it is only because you are so little. I was 5'9 and 130 with my first pregnancy and I started showing around 5-6 months but then 7-9 I just blew up! LOL This time around, I am still 5'9" but have gained some weight since 5 years ago and I am already seeing a small bump and I am less than 2 months. My clothes are getting tighter and stomach a little harder. You will probably get bigger gradually instead of all at once like I did! You look so cute and you have nothing to worry about! Show that baby belly off cutie! Good luck! Oh and I could not help but laugh, you are just like me with the HPT!!! Too cute!|`|cnIzqEoDaa	You are showing a lot for 9 weeks! My neighbor is your size and just now showing that much at 13 weeks. I think that if your uterus is positioned leaning forward, that is making you show more. Also, being on the shorter side, you may stick out more than up as you get further along (there's only so much room to get bigger upwards in a short waist). You look pregnant already, and not fat, so you should feel lucky! Congrats.|`|IecyUQBuaa	I'm about the same size & height. 2nd pregnancy & mine bump looks exactly the same. they do say because we are small petite the bump would be more visible, sooner. be glad, as long as baby's safe & healthy. i wouldnt worry bout a thing, just enjoy it.|`|EnCbkStYaa	hello..<br>  <br>  if you want read something about healthy,pregnancy question,or sign about pregnancy..<br>  i come just accross this blog : <a href="http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogsp...</a> which may help you.|`|mldo1vxYaa	I would say yes you are bigger than most women at this stage BUT if your doctor said your uterus is positioned differently then this would explain it.|`|sLkruqYVaa	so 2 months pregnant most women havent started showing yet  all though it just depends it might just be amniotic fluid some women carry a lot of it or twins perhaps?|`|rC6gL7KOaa	The smaller you are, the sooner you will start showing.

My Mum is %ft 2 (and a half) and was massive when she was pregnant with me, the Drs told her I was twins or more.  I was a tiny 7lb baby when I was born.
s4LWmcTjaa	They are called harness and leads.  Leashes go around the neck.  A harness and lead is a little back pack with a lead attached to it.<br>  <br>  And I think they are just fine if used properly.  We have one for our toddler that he picked out himself.  It's a little monkey back pack with a three foot long tail as the lead.  He likes wearing it.  We really only need it or use when we go to places like a state fair or a large crowded area where he could get lost easily (and yes a well behaved child can still run off or even worse get snatched).<br>  <br>  I think it's more inhumane to strap a child into a stroller all day long and not let them have some freedom to explore their surroundings.  And yes they can hold your hand, but do you really want to spend the whole day with your arm straight up for hours and hours?  A harness and lead allows a child the ability to walk and have some freedom while still keeping them in arms reach.  It makes it a heck of a lot harder for some sicko to snatch a child too!<br>  <br>  Bottom line, my child's safety is more important to me than people who look down on my for using a harness and lead.  The only time I have a problem with it is when I see a parent using it to literally drag their child around or tether their child to a bench or tree (sad but it does happen).|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I'm guessing you've probably never taken a 2 1/2 year old and his/ her young siblings to Disney World?  <br>  <br>  Well, neither have I.  I'm not even sure I would use one either.  That said, I can totally understand WHY someone would.  If I decided to, I'd rather have someone like you judge me than to lose my child.|`|4gZYucHMaa	It's all about control.  Your child should know to stay with his/she parent, if he doesn't the parent isn't doing enough to keep control of their child. <br>  <br>  It was quite simple, I had a stroller for my child and if they wanted to walk (which I was happy for them to do), then they needed to stay by me. IF they didn't, if they ran away etc then in the stroller they'd go back. Children are smart, you can teach them to stay with you at a very early age. .I have found that people who use those leashes/leads are parents who have no control over their child and lack discipline.<br>  <br>  Unless there's a medical reason I don't see the point for it.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Until you have a 'wanderer,' don't even assume it's the parent's fault or they're being lazy. Please! I tried one for awhile because my son would often get curious and walk away, and with another younger child, I could not always have my eyes going in two different directions. In certain situations, I think they're appropriate, and give the kid some freedom to move around instead of being yanked by the arm all the time. That, and mom has a free hand for the stroller. <br>  <br>  I might use one on my younger daughter, who is well-behaved - thanks for asking, LInda R - but is just young enough to a) not completely understand to stay close and b) is so darn tiny she would easily get swallowed up in a crowd. I'll have another one coming soon so we're running short on stroller ideas - for those who think it's such a bad idea, I'll take cash donations for a new and improved, bigger and better stroller, if you're interested. LOL<br>  <br>  ETA: LOL at some of the negative comments - do you have kids? Are they even born yet? We'll see what you think in a year or two! LMAO|`|WlU3NFu6aa	My daughter is 13 months and she has one. She likes to run around on her own and its very hard to reason with her to hold hands. I would rather have her on a leash (hers is a dog backpack harness actually) and know she cant get away then have her running around in a crowded place. we only use it in very crowded places. like the zoo<br>  <br>  ETA~ yes i understand that children should be taught to hold hands and I do try. But have you tried reasoning with a very stubborn one yr old>?|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I thought those things had gone away like 10 years ago. I agree with you.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I don't think it's wrong. You can compare it to a dog, so I'll do just that. If you have a puppy that's out walking with you, you keep it on a leash because it's untrained and you don't want it running in the road or running away. Same thing with a small child. Some like to walk, but don't quite have the understanding to stay by you at all times. You want to keep your dogs safe and active, so you leash them up and have them walk with you. Why not do the same for kids? <br>  <br>  I don't think it's right to have a child over 3 on a baby leash unless it's in a very crowded place, but before that, I see no issue at all. Walking is healthier and the "leash" gives you added safety and free hands.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think it is fine if you live in cities and need the extra help to keep your child safe. Imagine a child who hates the stroller (horrible to use in cities anyway)....the leash helps to give the child a bit of roaming room while being able to keep them safe. It's not treating them like dogs at all, it is keeping them safe...not to mention.. it can also be handy to keep a stronger hold on them in the case of a child snatcher or a child who tries to break away. It' a much stronger hold...PLUS of you have more than one child it's not so easy to push the baby in a stroller while holding the other's hand. It is not about not having control of your children.. it is about wanting to keep them safe in all situations. BTW these have been around for awhile folks.. my brother needed one back in the 80s because he liked to wander and pull away fast. <br>  <br>  Edit: also those backpacks are better for them anyway... with thim holding their little arm up all the time, a shoulder or an elblow can easily get dislocated if they try to pull away (which all kids will) or if they get bumped by someone...with a backpack  harness their arms are safe and free from tugging, and pulling.<br>  <br>  EDIT EDIT: okay.. 5 or 6 is a bit much, but I've never seen that. But there must be a reason for them then thatyou don't know about.. prehaps special needs when they don't understand staying close by.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i think it's horribly. each person has their own reason for doing it but when i see a kid on a leash i just think 'oh gees' i mean what has this world come to when a parent can't control their own kid and they have to put them on a leash? ehhh distasteful....<br>  and if anyone thinks MY answer is bad talk to my mother in law about it because when she sees kids on a leash like that she's actually bit**eyenough to SAY SOMETHING!!!!! she's crazy though lol|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	if you are keeping your child safe from harm, i see nothing wrong w/it.  i have children.  so far i don't have a bolter.  if i did and it made me feel safe and my child safe I would use one.<br>  <br>  edit - wow lady.  how hateful are you?  how many kids do you have?  ever have multiple toddlers at a time?  of all the things to judge a parent about - keeping their kid safe ISN"T one of them.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i think its fine. some children don't listen even if they haven't been taught. a lot of kid napping is going on. they are just watching out for them. accidents happen|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I tried a kid leash once....it just didn't work very well and I was more worried about knocking my kid over then him getting away from me|`|tkSXjqhuaa	It's a personal decision, dont like it? dont do it.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i hate those kids leash ... i will never use it on my kid.|`|xieiM0FRaa	You mean those little backpacks with leashes on them?<br>  <br>  I really think it depends on how you use them. They can be very helpful, since little ones have a tendency to just walk away and you can't always keep both eyes on them, especially in crowded places like the mall and grocery store. But, I agree with you because some parents do treat them like dogs. It really depends on how you make use of it, but I think they can be pretty handy and can keep little kids safe.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And how do you suggest teaching the children to stay with you without something like that? You would rather risk losing your kid? [sarcasm]You're right, I see your point.[/sarcasm]|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I think its funny that people have decided that children who act like children (running around, playing, being happy) is that the parents don't know how to discipline. I had a wrist leash as a child and I remember i loved it, I could play and still know my mom was near. I do remember one time we went for a walk when it was darker out ( i was prob 4) and I had it on. If my daughter was a runner then i would. She likes being in a cart at the store and the stroller when were out and shes 2. If we went to the zoo or the mall or something and she started to take off id get her one. You can tuck the strap in and just use it as a back pack and pull it out when they start to run. What I have seen that is wrong is when a parent is pulling the child along like a dog.|`|xi7mq1xGaa	I take offense to the people who are saying if you use a 'leash' (in the UK we call them reins, or wrist straps, and the backpack things are quite new so I'm not sure what they're called!) you have problems with discipline and can't control your child. My mum was the strictest parent in the neighbourhood, much stricter than any of my relatives, people always commented on how well behaved my brother and I were and that you could take us anywhere and we would behave, yet she used reins on both of us. Someone said that if the child ran off put them back in the pushchair. Well, what if you don't have a pushchair with you? And what if you have a baby and a couple of toddlers to control. It's all very well saying you will teach them to hold hands or stay by your side, but children are not machines and even the most placid of toddlers might get distracted by a cat or something across the road and dart out. It only takes one time for that well behaved child to step in front of a car and you've lost them forever. They are also quite good methods of encouraging your child to walk properly and not run into the road. I was out of reins by 2 and a half, but one day I put one foot in the road when we had stopped at the kerb. My mum put me back in reins for a couple of weeks and I never did it again. I see loads of children aged 3 and 4 running away from their mums and not paying a blind bit of notice when they are told off. Yes, they should have learnt by then but a lot of people haven't bothered to teach them properly. They'd soon learn not to run off if they were put in reins for a while!|`|68d8ad07f5b8eb2e788d4d05c809eeeaaa	If you mean those funny animal looking backpacks with leash attached than I think it's funny and cute. I am planning to use one. My boy is very active and running everywhere, so if I am going to be in crowd I want to be sure hi is next to me. He doesn't like to hold hands or sit in a stroller, so this is perfect solution until he gets older. he is 11 months.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I personally don't like them.  I have a 7 month old son, and when he can walk he will learn just like I did to stay by mommy and daddy when we're out places.  I learned, so did everyone else I know.  Heck, I STILL to this day hold onto the shopping cart when I'm out shopping with my mom! lol...old habits die hard!|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	I think they are wonderful tools to help parents keep up with their kids.  Those people who are against them are probably the parents of those kids that we always trip over because they are running around unsupervised.   Or we see them wondering around lost because mommy wasn't paying attention.<br>  <br>  Awesome invention!|`|29a2wm7Eaa	I would never use one to walk down the street with on a normal day but I sure would if I was going to a place where a huge crowd was going to be without a stroller.  That seems kinder to me than taking the chance of losing the little one.|`|eytlIKITaa	I can't stand it!  I think it's absolutely ridiculous to have your kid on a leash- if they're really that out of control that you feel you need to leash them, that's your flippin fault!  You could just hold their hand or put them in a stroller!  Come on!|`|dDVAUA9saa	If you don't like it then it doesn't really matter what anybody else thinks or does, you don't have to do it just because other people do.|`|M2yERqNSaa	maybe the kid is retarded like your opinion<br>  <br>  if it keeps a kid safe it keeps them safe<br>  <br>  it just proves youre the kind of person who would keep an animal safer than a child|`|sAbah6dTaa	i think it's wrong no matter what, put the kid in a stroller for peets sake!|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Weigh it up : Lost child or Safe child ... which would you prefer?
P7tue78Aaa	You can install internet filter software. Internet filter software gives you the ability to control content displayed, block websites and set up passwords. Powerful services like email filtering, popup blocking and chat room monitoring are just some of the tools available with today's internet filter software, each designed to protect against and counteract the tactics of aggressive online porn companies.<br>  <br>  My brother was doing the same thing at that age. Boys will be boys... I don't think that she needs to be embarrassed to ask her parents about this. Also, to install the filter, she will need their permission.<br>  <br>  Here's a website with reviews of the top ten internet filters to protect families from unwanted pornography:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.internet-filter-review.topten...</a><br>  <br>  Added: That's too bad about her parents... She should have a talk to her brother about not using the family computer for that stuff and have her delete the internet history. Go to Tools and clear the data there.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	It is perfectly natural for a young boy this age to start feeling sexual, and I would think since the porn sites are so easy to find, that would be the avenue he would go to look at naked women. <br>  <br>  Not every person is going to develop an addiction so I wouldn't worry at all. It is not your friends business what her brother does with his body. You should both forget about it.<br>  <br>  And no, he probably won't grow out of it. It is not a phase.|`|bVaZ72f3aa	delete the history on internet !!<br>  u click ctrl and letter ''h'' at the same time..and then delete all he watched etc etc...<br>  also click on the place where u enter the website address,the little arrow on the right of it so he can delete all of it..<br>  xoxo<br>  be careful,porn can give ur computer viruses..<br>  honestly, i know this wont be her/his first time watching porn..it never is..after u watch it the first time,and the website called www.boysfood.com is much safer then anything else.|`|OLy54IDOaa	watching porn is pretty normal for boys that age|`|yas23v7laa	its porn. its no big deal, all boys will look, just tell her to leave him alone, its only porn. she doesnt have to say anything to anyone about it, just tell her to tell her brother to make sure he doesnt get caught if their parents are that bad. ITS ONLY PORN NO BIG DEAL.<br>   leave the boy alone|`|p0prrzf2aa	he's a BOY he's gonna be curious|`|rjVALevtaa	It could be a phase for him, or he could do this his entire life. There's no way to know for sure. <br>  <br>  She should really tell her parents about this, they can buy software to block websites like those so he cannot see them.
Fy9S6hjIaa	Grrrrr....I hate that so bad.  I think most parents do because you can never find 2 packs with like green and blue, or green and orange.  I know that they do exist, because I have gotten them before, but my theory is that all of the normal colored packages get picked up really quickly.  If you've ever spent much time in the sippy cup isle you notice that your not the only one searching through rows of cuppies to try to find a pack that doesn't have purple swirls on the cup, or a bright pink lid.  It'd be easier with a girl.  My SIL has a girl and she just buys any color of sippy cup.  Its OK when the green and pink ones come together, because it doesn't look funny when a baby girl is carrying around a green cuppie like it does when a boy is carrying around a purple one. LOL|`|CE3bmj65aa	I had this same this happen with the NUK pacifiers.  I was getting some for my son and there were two different combinations of colors, a pink and purple one or a blue and pink one.  I just ended up buying the one with blue and pink and giving the pink ones to a friend for her daughter.  Also another time I saw a pack that had a green pacifier with sailboats and a pink pacifier with butterflies in the same pack.  I guess it is okay if you have boy/girl twins, lol.|`|hJWjSWYXaa	if you don't want people to see the purple cup then use that one for the house only and take the other one with you!<br>  But I bought my nephew a couple of bottle when he was little a boy pack it what it was called and when I opened up the box there where all the color's of the rainbow in there including PINK! I didn't understand why it was called a boy pack if it had a pink bottle but whatever we gave it to his sister!|`|OrKpKxkHaa	The only thing that bothers me is the people who it bothers! My daughter's friend in preschool parents told me that they were buying a kitchen set for thier son as a Christmas present. When they started telling everyone, they all gasped and said "oh no that is a girls toy" Men aren't chefs? I dont get the whole gender thing. My daughter plays with matchbox cars. Oh and I bought those pacifiers for my 3 month old daughter, blue sailboats and all! Who cares what others think I thought they were cute! Do what YOU like. Good luck!|`|KUxEBQuYaa	i know what you mean. i went and got a 2 pack of sippy's the other day. one was bright blue, the other was green with a pink lid. it was weird. <br>  it bothers me when i can't find a pair of socks that doesn't have princesses on them or lil pink ruffles. i just want a pair of plain white socks. thats it.|`|0zWJlNi1aa	Id have thought purple was more of a boy's colour anyway - Lilac I would say for girl's but purple for a boy - I would dress my son in a pair of purple dungarees or a purple jumper<br>  <br>  Hmmm - I dont know now - but Id never think a boy with a purple cup looked girly|`|jBnQiZVFaa	They do it with pacifiers too.  One yellow with pink and the other mint green and blue.  I never really cared. But they really should just stick with one boy pack, one girl pack, and one gender neutral.  I think it would be a lot simpler.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	my 19 year old brothers favorit color purple so i never thought of that to be a "girly" color i guess.. they dont care eather. i can see not giving him hot pink but purple is fine. whatever. just put a blue top on it or something.|`|lP2qYUIpaa	I did the same thing!  I couldn't believe I had to buy him a purple cup.  My son had been using his cousin's cup, which was pink, so I bought the two pack so that he didn't have to have the "girly" one anymore.  Who knows, I guess that purple is the new blue??|`|rzO0RX9vaa	I never thought purple was exclusively for girls.|`|eaO0MRaBaa	I just think it is stupidly sexist.|`|AA11210211	It doesn't bother me because a color is just a color they don't specify a gender in fact my daughters room is done in pink and green,but yes I have seen this before.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Your question made me look at the two pack of sippy cups my husband bought the other night in our endless pursuit of a sippy cup my son will use.<br>  <br>  One is pink, the other is purple.  Apparently it doesn't bother all dads, and it certainly doesn't bother me.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	My hubby is the same way.  When our boys were young I could forget it about getting them ANYTHING pink and purple BUT now that we have a little GIRL all colors are okay for her.  We actually look for blue things b/c she has so many pink and purple things.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	Just that they always make more cute pink stuff for girls. Boys stuff tends to be much more plain. Also, I have noticed things like pacifiers coming with like blue and green, but the green had lavender butterflies on it. My son doesn't need lavender butterflies!|`|68c6B8dRaa	"dad doesn't want his son walking with a purple cup"<br>  <br>  Thas' right! Ain't gonna be no nancy-boys in this house, I tellya.

hKJIDdVqaa	yeah seriously she sounds bi polar and manic depressive, and she needs MAJOR help.  She cannot be trusted with her mood swings.  Call adult services they will help her, and MOVE out. You can lose your child if they are in an unfit unstable environment.|`|AA11530601	no thats hard.....must be very annoying.....distance yourself from her, i dont mean cut her out of your life but show her you can cope on your own and then hopefully she will appreciate you and stop saying things like your gonna put all the responsibility on her.....i know ur not going to put all the responsibility on her, but it really sounds like she hasnt thought it through and is still finding it hard to cope with the fact you are growing up and spreading your wings....and probably convinces herself you are not ready for this as a way of convincing herself you are still a child. x|`|vG0tsqJtaa	You should probably leave.  You sound like you are starting you own life so regardless of the relationship with your mom, you should try to get out on your own.

vjsT8DMIaa	I too, work full time. Im a nurse at a local nursing home on a vent unit...I do what I do because I LOVE IT, and it is my CAREER. Not because Im forced to, due to financial restraints. The money is nice though. I think if I stayed home all day long, I would probably lose my mind. Now there are some days where I wish I didn't have to work....but most days, I don't mind...because for me, its not work. I love my patients and Ive bonded closely with their families. <br>  I work evenings and my husband is in the military. I get up in the morning, get my oldest to school....get my 2 year old breakfast, and feed my 3 month old. I then do a quick cleaning of the house as well as some laundry. I leave for work at 1pm, in which my 3 kids then go to the babysitters house until my husband picks them up at 5:30pm. So they aren't being watched very long. I get home around 11pm, off to bed..wake up at night with the baby and then the same thing in the morning. So for any SAHM that thinks working parents have it easier....I think not. Its equally just as hard.  I think maybe if I didn't have a career settled before having kids I would love to be a SAHM, but Im not willing to give up what I love doing...when I can do both. My children are very much loved, don't want for anything, and are all around great kids!! <br>  That being said....I choose to work.<br>  <br>  my mom was a sahm her whole life...and always blamed it on us when my sister and I got older. She was never able to go to college and do what she wanted because she HAD to have us girls and raise us....I will never make my children feel like that!!|`|UghJ0XROaa	I don't think i would have the patience or enough sanity to be a SAHM. I actually think it's harder and more stressful to be a SAHM, so maybe by working i feel i am taking the easy way out, but i know i am not cut out to be a SAHM and i know my 2 year old is a lot more well adjusted for it.|`|AA11109728	I work full time because I have to, but even if I didn't have to I think I'd still rather enjoy working at least part time.  I'd go nuts staying home all the time and not interacting with others, and I know my daughter would feel the same way.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	well i dont really like working but its good for the interaction and getting out the house. i wish i could part time but i cant right now. i think i may like it for a little bit but then id go nuts being home all day.|`|8WRnqs08aa	You're not alone. I was a SAHM with my older three. I have a 7 mo old and I worked FT before she was born. I went back to work on a reduced schedule and I work less than 30 hours per week now. I am expecting twins in Sept., and it kills me that I am going to have to quit my job to stay home with these babies, but I'd rather stay home now because it would make no sense for me to pay someone to care for my children all week and only bring home a $500 monthly profit. Childcare for 3 infants in diapers would kill us. [sigh]<br>  <br>  So, I will become a SAHM once again, but I am going to try to find something I can do out of my home to earn a little extra income on the side. I just like the independence of having my own flow of income and not feeling like Hubby is the sole provider. I have older children & I don't want him to feel like he has to pay their way, too.<br>  <br>  I love to work and as soon as the babies are old enough for preschool, I will get back out into the workforce. I already work around my older kid's schedules, so I am able to pick them up & be with them after school each day.<br>  <br>  ***Let me add that my sister cares for my 7 mo., but will not be able to care for her AND the twins and I am not comfortable with my babies being left with complete strangers all day***<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due in Sept.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Hmm I work.  It makes things easier.  I would rather bring in some extra cash and be a little independent.  I worked at this job before I met him and for time it was my wage that supported us.  He now has a better job and he is now the main bread winner.  I work bc I don't think I have it in me to be a SAHM.  Power to those who can and are.  But I like making my own money.  I like not having to ask him for cash to go shopping or explaining to him why or where money went.  My son is healthy well adjusted little man.  Im currently off on mat leave until Sept or Oct.  After that I will return to my job or bc of possible cut backs find a new one.  Im Canadian and this SAHM thing seems to be more of  American thing.  Seriously all the Mom's I know work.  Even part time at least.  I know very few SAHMs.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I'll be honest with you. My b/f makes plenty enough money for me to be a stay at home mom but I have chosen not to. You ARE right it is NOT for everyone. I enjoy working! and I absolutely LOVE being with my son but staying at home is just NOT my thing. I quit my job to be a stay at home mom and three months later I was working again. And I don't care what anyone says but just as you need a break from your baby sometimes. They also need a break from their mom. Not to mention how much better their social skills are being at a daycare or in home care. My son LOVES his babysitter and he LOVES spending the day with the kids because he's an only child and it gives him a chance to play with other kids. YOU ARE SO RIGHT! I completely agree with you. And don't feel bad because there is nothing wrong with being a working mom. And not to mention we actually have a leg to stand on if something wasn't to work between us and the babies father ;)|`|y6g0RnuAaa	You are exactly right! I think that people automatically feel sorry for working moms (like they are forced into it.) It is true that some wish to be home but it is not true for all. I am a SAHM but my cousin is not. That is her choice and her husband stays home because that is his choice (he had a great career as well.) She has a very rewarding life. She loves the work that she does. She balances work/family beautifully and I admire her so much for it. <br>  <br>  I think it's great to have work that you love. Many can't say the same and maybe that is why they assume?|`|EhGR05Etaa	I agree with you...a lot of women feel that they will loose their Identity if they are JUST a mommy.  I don't agree but I think even if I didn't work a full time job...I would have to do SOMETHING else also.  Luckily I work at home so I can be both....but I don't think all women that have the chance to be a SAHM are just because some people enjoy working and contributing to the family as far as money goes.|`|JpE5ELbqaa	What's great is that we can all chose what we want to do with our lives.  It's no one else's business what we do with that life.  Working or staying at home (which is also work but with no pay) moms each love their children.  This debate is irrelevant.  No one else's decision is going to affect what I want or what you want to do.  Again, and I've said this often today... people need to mind their own business and quit casting judgment.|`|c9f2a1b3d1f4937e76dfc5f19e0e903daa	I am a working mother by CHOICE!  There is no way that I would want to stay home all day, every day with my kids.  I have an 8 year old and 4 year old now and am happy to be working.  I love my children a lot, but do not have the patients to be a SAHM.|`|Hpp26zQjaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with being a working mom. More power to you girl!|`|67FH2HoMaa	I am right there with emmy nicole. I work simply because I have to. I am a single mother, but even if I didn't have to work there is no way I could be a stay at home Mom. I think everyone needs a life outside of the home and away from the children. I enjoy coming to work everyday and I enjoy being challenged, and the social interactions with my co-workers. I know there are people that can stay at home all day with kid's that's why I pay them to watch my son =). I do not have the patience to be a full-time stay at home Mom even though I love my son more than anything.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I want to work.  I value feeding my brain and having a life outside of my family (although they are most important).  I also think it is important to have an identity outside of your children/husband because one day when the kids are grown and gone- what are you going to do?  If your whole life was this family and it has moved on (this scenario- God forbid- husband leaves/dies) what is next for you?  It is VERY important to be independent and grow as a person and no one out there who is a SAHM (barring the ones with trust funds) can tell me that they are self sufficient.  Maybe they have the ability to be, but they are not right now.  I think taking care of children is a very important job- about as meaningful as it gets.  But it is not for me- I enjoy working- I never wanted to be a SAHM- however, I do value time spent with my son and have cut back on hours since his birth.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I serve full time in the military. I am a mom of two and am currently 6 months pregnant with baby #3. I am currently off work until my baby is born because of complications with this pregnancy and am going crazy. Being a SAHM is just not for me. I LOVE my children but need a sense of accomplishment outside of the laundry room! My older child loves what his parents do for a living and is very proud of us.<br>  <br>  I understand that some women are very content and that is their right but it is definitely not for everyone.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I answered that a lot of mothers would want to stay home if they could,  I was also going to include that some mothers enjoy working as well and the interaction outside of the home.  I actually was going to go back and add it until I realized that she was a troll and I wasn't going to waste my time going in dept with an answer to her.  <br>  I am sorry if my answer excluded you and your situation as well as other mothers that choose to work.  I think it is totally acceptable as well.  To each their own.|`|308cb6bcf0531e27237a2cb393891091aa	After this past weekend, I'm SOOOO glad that i'm working......<br>  my daughter turns 6 months on Thursday and is teething bad, and is cranky and wants to chew on everything. and cried if we don't give her something that she saw and wanted...... would not let me put her down for even a sec. coz she wanted mommy all day to hold her. Did not nap unless I was holding her.....by 4:30pm, I was exhausted beyond believe and had to call my hubby back from visiting his friends to watch ehr, so I could use the bathroom and eat something....<br>  <br>  nyways. But I like working. I love my daughter to bits, but no way I can spend all my time in the house. I'd go crazy....|`|X6as2nOAaa	To tell you the truth I do have to work because Im a single mom so I do have to, but I love my job I look forward to coming in everyday. If I had the money to just sit at home everyday I would still go to work, I don't want to sit at home all day everyday. I like feeling independent and that is my break time away from baby. I love her to death but I would have her 24/7 so i look forward to going to work and I wouldn't have it any other way.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	when im having a bad day at work i want to be a sahm, when im tired because my daughter had a bad night i want to be a sahm, when the laundry is piled high and my tables havent been dusted in 3 days i want to be a sahm. but by sunday night after 2 days off i know i need to be at work with other adults its vital to my well being.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	The money is nice, yes, but when I have kids, I am sure I will want to stay at home to raise my child(ren).  It is very hard to grasp the concept of another person raising your child.  I do enjoy work, but I enjoy children more.|`|AA10096832	Well, I'm going to respond with two answers because I have two "part-time" jobs outside of taking care of my toddler. (I'm a WAHM)<br>  <br>  1) My tech job that I do while my daughter is asleep is okay. I actually don't love it and I do do it simply to pay the bills. It's nice to use another area of my brain but it's not my calling. I often wish I had a job/career that I really loved and that paid me enough to be able to in turn pay my bills. So I think you are lucky that you really enjoy your job. You may be one of a minority, to be honest. Which is maybe where the assumption comes that you only work because you have to! Many of us are like that. ;)<br>  <br>  2) I also work as an actor, mostly at night (rehearsals and performances are generally at night). It doesn't pay all that well but this is a job that really feeds my soul (while at the same time draining my energy reserves!). So I do choose to do that work, knowing that I make some sacrifices to do so. It's different because I'm still with my daughter the bulk of the day but still, it's an active choice that I'm making that will take me away from my child.<br>  <br>  If I had my way, I would not have a day job at all. I would take periodic acting jobs, though. I don't know if this answers your question but it certainly is a thought-provoking one.<br>  <br>  Again, revel in the fact that you enjoy working and don't dread your job! It's actually a nice thing. I think you are modeling to your children that they won't necessarily have to hate their jobs when they grow up! This is a good thing for them to see. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: After reading these answers, I'm also going to add that you don't need to have a job outside the home to have grownup interactions and feel like you're accomplishing something. You can do this with friends, with volunteering, taking a class, being on the board of a nonprofit etc etc. Plus being with your kids makes you feel like you're accomplishing something. It's not just doing dishes and laundry. In fact, taking my daughter to different places always takes precedence over dishes and laundry. (Yes, my house is a mess.) And watching her development is pretty darn exciting and does give me a sense of accomplishment. I don't need a paycheck to give me that.

0iUxfCMcaa	every pregnancy is different saying that implantation bleeding can be different for everybody. mine was a light period brown blood then pink then red then brown with in 2-3days then it was gone. so yeah it can be just brown blood, or just spotting, or even light period that is alot shorter then your normal periods are.|`|xpstigPTaa	My implantation bleeding was only a couple of dark brown spots when I wiped after going to the bathroom.

Best of luck to you!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Oh yes, my due date was off by a couple of weeks because I thought the implantation bleed was my period.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Engorgement shouldn't last more than 48 hours, and it shouldn't be painful.<br>  <br>  Normal engorgement is caused by an increase in blood and lymph fluid, it can cause the breasts to be warm.  Painful engorgement is caused by excess milk and is often a sign that baby isn't nursing as well as they could be, in which case baby needs to be carefully monitored to make sure not only are they getting enough fluid but also enough fat and calories (primarily through tracking poopy diapers, and to a lesser degree weight gain).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=11&page=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=1...</a><br>  The breasts. The woman's breasts usually feel heavy, 'firm' or 'full' and warm. They will increase considerably in size (although this is only temporary for a few days). The breasts may look a little flushed, and the woman may have a slight temperature (up to 38 degrees Celsius). Most of the 'fullness' in the breasts is due to an increase in blood supply to the breasts (called 'vascular engorgement') and an expansion of the lymph supply, as well as the start of the mature milk production. This is why it is usually difficult for the woman to judge if her breasts feel 'full' or 'empty' after a feed (or to tell by feeling, which breast she fed from last!)<br>  <br>  For a day or so, the supply of milk will be a little more than the baby needs, contributing to an 'overfull' feeling. It is crucial for the baby to feed 'on-demand' at this time, to keep the milk flowing, otherwise the normal vascular engorgement will turn into painful 'milk engorgement', as the alveoli distend with milk. However, many women will want to feed their baby regularly at this time, because it relieves the overfullness.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec97Jan98p123.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec...</a><br>  In answer to the question, "Is baby getting enough?" a second question could be posed, "Enough of which?" In the early weeks wet diaper counts give only part of the answer. Because the nursing newborn takes in plenty of foremilk before receiving the richer hindmilk, it would be difficult for an infant to produce several bowel movements per day without being adequately hydrated.<br>  <br>  However, the opposite can easily occur. Since feeding practices, ineffective sucking or other problems may diminish the mother's milk supply or prevent the baby from receiving an adequate portion of hindmilk, it is possible for a baby to be adequately hydrated yet have an inadequate calorie intake. Frequent urination remains one valid indicator of adequate newborn hydration from foremilk intake. Multiple daily stooling is an indicator of adequate newborn calorie intake from hindmilk. Both factors are needed to fully assess neonatal breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  Since a lack of daily stooling may be associated with inadequate newborn calorie intake, it is also a predictor of poor infant weight gain. Early detection of this symptom can be crucial for the baby's health and the continuation of breastfeeding. In severe cases, an infant's low calorie intake may lead to weaker sucking, diminished milk supply and critical dehydration. While less serious conditions may be improved at various stages of breastfeeding, it is much more effective to establish a generous milk supply and hearty weight gain in the early weeks than to have to work to achieve them in later months.|`|dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	CONGRATULATIONS on the safe arrival of your baby!!<br>  <br>  Are you breast feeding?

It is not covered by any insurance carrier that I know of. Clomid is a flat price, so even if you are taking a higher dosage, it will only be $9. And you can shop for pregnancy tests and OPK's while you're waiting for them to fill it. Oh FYI... pregnancy tests, OPK's, and Clomid are all covered by Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA's), so talk to your employer (or partner's employer) who you have medical insurance through. The money is taken out pre-tax, lowers your taxable income, and you get reimbursed for it. Its definitely helped me over the last few years.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie!|`|AA12362903	I remember it was a very expensive pill.

ODosyM8zaa	My sister and her partner got four beautiful children from using a sperm donor (yes, the same one!). In 1995 they started the paperwork and all that good stuff. In 2001 they welcomed their first baby girl!<br>  <br>  It depends. On just the first year they ended up spending a good $10,000. BUT they also got pregnant and ended up having a miscarriage. So about $10,000 for 2 pregnancies (one failed, one carried to full term).<br>  <br>  First they had to really dig deep and decide if using a sperm donor was best for them (rather then adoption since they are both female). Then they had to take blood tests, psychological tests and fitness tests to make sure they were ready for a baby! After all this was complete they looked at profiles of men and chose a donor. The doctors had to review their health histories to make sure they were a suitable match. A few weeks later my sister's egg was impregnated. Sadly, she suffered a miscarriage at 7 weeks but the next try was successful, same procedure.<br>  <br>  Before you start looking into pregnancy by donor you should decide if this is something you are entirely ready for. If so, check your local phone book and ask your regular doctor for some references. Schedule a meeting with a few different doctors that specialize in donor pregnancies and get to know their practice. In order for everything to go smooth, you need to be comfortable with the doctor. He/she will also need an extensive medical history. Good luck and I hope this helps. BABY DUST!!

c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	It's hard to know exactly when the ovulation occurs but whenever you r see the EWCM (egg white cerical mucus) it means time to get dowm with the hubby b/c you could possibly get pregnant during that time. It is best to start having sex on the day you notice the ewcm b/c you're best chances of concieving is actually the day before you concieve (have the sperm waiting for th egg when it is released)<br>  You will have ewcm before during and a day or so after ovulation, it is your most fertile time.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It means you are in your fertile window...once you ovulate it will dry up pretty quickly.|`|34YAS4a0aa	ovulation! do the baby dance if your ttc!

ZcrsqMbcaa	why would you accept a phone call from a person who rapes children|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Why tell her? Go ahead with the adoption and have a good life. If you chose to then explain things to her when she's an adult, if it comes up earlier-tell her how much her "real" Dad loves her and you got pregnant with her in a chance encounter that turned out bad. The biggest and best thing in your life is probably this little girl-who chose YOU and probably your fiance. Remember gifts come to you in odd ways and be thankful. I don't see a need to give her any bad memories when all you have now are good things going on. Sounds like your man is her real Dad anyway. Just be glad you have no contact and make sure the courts keep him legally away from your family  (the criminal father). Good Luck and congradulations!|`|AA12020110	You need to talk with an attorney.    If the biological father is not paying child support then you can take action to keep him away.  <br>  <br>  Also there is no need at present to tell your daughter anything about her biological father.  <br>  When she is older you can tell her that she had a father before her Daddy but he went away and her Daddy is the only Daddy she needs to be concerned with.  Keep it simple.  When she is older you may want to tell her the full story.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	my baby's daddy left me after tricking me (told me he was wearing one when he wasn't) and i'm now with my partner of nearly 2 years ~(we got together when she was 2 m/o) i've decided not to tell her about her bio father as i'm worried she'll go looking for him, he was abusive and is not suitable to be a father, i don't want her getting her heart broken by him either, i fell it'll be a lot kinder for her to believe that daddy is her bio father.|`|hUUWlLeBaa	talk to an attorney. being that he is not a citizen he should have no parental rights in the US and you should be able to get a restraining order against him, but you need legal counsel. What you tell her is up to you but at some point she will need to know the truth. You should wait until she can fully understand the situation as an adult, so wait at least until she is a teenager...|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	When I was about 5 my mom told me a fairy tale of how my real dad left me and her by ourselves and how my adopted dad came and found us in the woods. It was enough that I knew what was going on but it didn't go into details so I would be confused at that age. When I got older I knew that who I called dad wasn't my biological father. When I was a little over 14 I wanted to meet my biological father and I did. And it turned out very well. My dad walked me down the aisle, not my biological father. With your situation I don't think she is going to want to meet her father. But once she gets to be a certain age you cant stop her from finding him. I would just tell her what she needs to know right now.|`|6359becf9ea83832470afde520533f08aa	You will need to tell her some time. Just make sure she understands everything before you do. Because if you don't tell her and she finds out on her own she is going to be hurt that you never did tell her and that you lied to her. You will also have to try and find the real father before he can adopt her. Because you have to give him a chance to come forward. I've checked into before.  I'm kinda in your shoes too.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Is this the illegal you wanted to marry (from your previous questions)?  Or do you have another child with a different immigrant? Sounds like you are way too caught up in guys, as most 17 year old are... but you have a baby, try concentrating on her.  8 months and you already want to marry him?  SLOW DOWN:)<br>  <br>  If you were raped, why would you want to prove he is the father?  That makes no since.|`|65RZ441Zaa	I would get a lawyer and tell him your plans. There may be something that can be put in place, considering he is a dangerous criminal. <br>  once your married go to court about the adoption. Just tell your baby that that man is her daddy, which HE IS he raised her , he feeds and cleans her, spend time with her .. he's the DADDY. <br>  Your baby doesn't need to know about your Violante past, she may feel differently about herself.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	get a court order!  that will keep him away. Plus get his custody taken away.  Just until you get her adopted.  Then all his rights are gone anyways.  And I would tell her that her father is the man that raised her, not who made her.  When she is older and understands I would tell her  the truth, be prepared for therapy.  It may be hard for her to take and understand right away.
5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	It is a possibility.  You may not have enough HCG in your system to register on the urine tests.

KICQQxLxaa	Hannah was a bit older when she had a seizure due to a fever.  She fell down, went a bit rigid and her left side was jerking.  Her eyes rolled back in her head and she was unresponsive to my voice.  The whole seizure lasted about a minute.<br>  <br>  If you even have a suspicion of a seizure, I would put a call into your doctor and let them know what you witnessed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XOtHsTo0aa	Sure sounds like a seizure to me.  My son had one as a baby when he was 6 months old and thats how I would describe it.  I would most definitely take her to the ER or doctors office.|`|TJ04fAgNaa	My almost 5 month old daughter has epilepsy and what you have described does sound like a seizure.  You need to call your pediatritian and let him or her know so that they can schedule her for an EEG.  They will attach electrodes to her head that are attached to wires and this will measure brain waves.  My daughter's first EEG came back normal but she continued having seizures so I pushed the doctors to do it again and not discharge her until they saw what I saw.  Lo and behold, they caught 3 seizures in the 23rd hour of the 24 hour test.  She is on Keppra right now and her seizures are under control as long as we keep increasing the meds as she gains weight.  My best advice is to not let the Dr's tell you everything is fine or that it's "reflux" (they tried telling me that...) until they have seen what you have described.  I know how frightening it is to see a seizure happen to your baby, but stay calm.  Don't try to hold her down or put anything in her mouth.  When my daughter has one, I will pick her up gently and just talk sweetly to her and stroke her hair.  If you are freaking out when your daughter wakes up, she will too, so stay calm and be reassuring.  I'm so sorry you're going through this but it can be managed with the right treatment.  Best of luck to you and your baby!|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi hon! I've seen seizures in people of many ages (including children), and this sounds like a seizure.<br>  <br>  Please bring her in to the ER.<br>  <br>  I hope all is well!|`|FUOLr64jaa	I've never seen a seizure in an infant before, but I hope that Laura is okay!!|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	sounds like a seizure, call your doctor asap.|`|GvuMyMFOaa	If you are concerned you should probably speak to her doctor about it.  It could have been a seizure, but may not have been.  Were her eyes moving or staring straight forward?  Usually when a baby has a seizure, their eyes roll up toward their forehead and twitch back and forth.  Also if you touched her when this occurred, was her body rigid?  Did she respond to your touch?  If her body was rigid and she didn't respond at all to your touch, it could have been a seizure.  It's really hard to tell with newborns.  The best advice I can give is that you speak with her doctor and have her examined just to be safe.|`|AA11573305	Well my brother has seizures all the time since he was a baby.So, when he had his first seizure we turned him on his side and rub his back.After,we rushed him to the hospital.My mom new what to do because she is a nurse.Anyway,bring the baby to the hospital.But,my cousin had one seizure when she was younger and never had one ever again.So,just make sure your sweetie is just fine.God bless you and your child.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i have seizures and it sounds to me that might of been what it was if i was you i would be on my way to the er just to be safe! i didnt start getting them until about 5 years ago out of no place good luck!|`|nZVGUzZzaa	she is a preemie so be on the safe side and take her to the doctor what does it hurt to have her checked out for your piece of mind, My sister had seizures from the time she was 6 months old till she passed away at the age of 10 so i have seen them and was extremely freaked out by any "shakeing or jerking" that my own children did but the doctors reasured me that at a young age childrens arms and legs do shake and jerk quite often because they do not have controll of them yet to swaddle them and if the shakeing and jerking continues while they are swaddled then have them checked.
36fe86666bb74ff171bad4cb394de371aa	Your daughter needs to stand up for herself and tell the baby, "Don't hit me (blank)" and walk away. The baby will eventually get that people will not want to play with him if he is going to be hitting.  Giving your daughter a voice is an important step. And with your sister tell her that it's not just your daughter that you care about but that aggressive behavior ostracizes the aggressor from social situations. You want your nephew to have friends and a healthy social life and if he's a hitter parents will keep their kids at a distance (or the kids will leave him out) or comment on the behavior keeping your sister away from those situations to begin with|`|HdOVYIWjaa	Your sister really needs to learn that hitting, biting and pulling hair is NOT appropriate for any child at any age.  She needs to discipline her son before the behaviors get worse.  It's great to hear that your daughter does not retaliate and hit him back.  Many other children probably would do that.  If I were you, I wouldn't let my daughter play with her son anymore and like the other commenter said, say something like "we don't play with children that hit" to get the message across to both your nephew and sister.  Good Luck!|`|2585e7e86671999b1b6f36975e39adf0aa	Wow this is a tough one.  I don't live with my sister but I had a similar problem where her son would hit my daughter.  I simply and very kindly told him that it was not nice to hit.  And then I reassured my daughter that she did a very good job not hitting him back. <br>  <br>  I used to work with developmentally disabled adults (most of them had the mentality of a child) and we would ignore the person doing the hitting and give 100% positive attention to the "victim."  Telling them that it's not nice to hit and that maybe we should go over here and play away from people who hit.  <br>  <br>  I also agree that maybe you could put him in time out.  Then if your sister gets upset at you for disciplining her child that's a whole other situation.  Unfortunately your daughter isn't going to put up with this for long and will probably eventually hit him back because she see's that there are no consequences for his actions.  And if this happens maybe your sister will be more apt to address the situation.  I know that sounds awful but your daughter getting hit all the time is sad!  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope it all works out for you!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that maybe you guys should talk about different living arrangments then.  If you continue to live together then your probibly going to do more harm to your relationship in which will harm the relationship that you have with each others children.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	why cant you put him in time out yourself. If you live together it is not like you are a stranger. if he were in daycare they would put him in time out. Try and explain to him what you are doing and why. If your sister has a problem with it then explain to her that your daughter has every right not to be attacked in her own home and if she won;t correct his behavior or at least attemp to them you have to do it for your own daughter.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	Living with family is usually a mistake because of things like this.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is control your actions, and what you require of your daughter. When your nephew hits your daughter, move into another room and tell your nephew that you don't play with children who hit. <br>  <br>  It *might* send a message tro your nephew, it will send a message to your sister, and it will teach your daughter not to just put up with someone hurting her.
0iYoPLGIaa	no... i prefer Caridee... I think it flows nice. Caridee Rae Hawthrone. Sounds good...<br>  I don't understand why so many people said they didn't like that name!!

e60hNP76aa	I don't think you have any right to ask that question of your mother either.  Respect goes a long way and you certainly don't respect your mother if your going to talk to her like that.  You need to remember that you are only 15, you are her daughter, she has raised you and that is no way to talk to her.  <br>  <br>  So would I talk to my daughters like that - well to start with my girls would never think of being so rude as to talk to me like that.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	now we don't know the whole story no do we?  If my daughter had a mouth on her and being disrespectful and not listening and cussing back then yes i would say that her.  You were being very disrespectful yourself in asking her what she ever accomplished.  like she was worthless.  Not a very nice thing to do either is it?|`|MW1yrHbOaa	heavens no, i am sorry she said that to you though, it makes me sad and i don't even know you|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	That's tough because I wouldn't let my 15yr old daughter question me about my accomplishments. You showed disrespect first because you have nothing to do with what she accomplished or not. So, her disrespectful response was to your disrespectful statement. If my daughter ever did that to me, although I wouldn't act like that, I'd let her know that I didn't appreciate the comment. <br>  <br>  When I was coming up, I would've never questioned my mother like that because I know that my mother raised me- which means protected me, fed me, gave me clothes, gave me money when I needed it, chauffered me to the mall or the movies or anywhere else I wanted to go, ensured that I was doing well in school, teaching me how to be a woman, and showing me how to be a mother- at a time when I couldn't do for myself. That is how I would like my daughter to feel about me, too. The day my daughter feels as if she can talk to me as if she's an adult, I'm going to treat her as one, which means charging her rent/bills, only supplying her basic needs such as food/clothes/shelter, and not giving her money. Kids should be kids and once they begin acting otherwise, it's time to start treating them as such.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	If she was so disrespectful of me to suggest that I had never accomplished anything in my life, I might be tempted to hurt her right back.<br>  <br>  You started it and you need to apologize first.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	no i wouldn't. you should tell her how that hurt your feelings, maybe she just said it because she was mad ( that doesn't make it right though).|`|AA10943329	there are two sides to every story. Sounds like you may have been pretty mean to your mum. In the heat of the moment we can all say things we regret. Your mum is human|`|bkOn30I1aa	Well it is a pretty harsh thing to say, she was probably really irritated and so were you so you both said things you really didn’t mean. That is why it is never wise to have a discussion when you are mad, because you end up making things worse, we can say really hurtful things without thinking about the other person’s feelings. I realize your mom was very wrong to say what she said, but have you thought about what you said to her? "What have you ever accomplished in life"? How hurtful do you think that was for her? Having her own daughter diminish all the work and the effort that as a mom she has put into your well being and education? Think about that, reflect on it and you will realize that you were very wrong for saying that, and of course, she was very wrong to say the things she said too. I think you should apologize and I am sure she will instantly apologize too. Good luck girl!|`|msNXomjTaa	Probably.<br>  <br>  It was extremely rude to suggest to your mother that she has never accomplished anything.  In fact, raising you to 15 is quite an accomplishment.  Being a parent is not easy - it is the hardest job there is that you don't have to qualify for first.  This is aside from the other accomplishments she may have had in her life - many of which you probably do not even know about, as being young, you were not there when she did them.  You basically told her she was useless - but, she did make you, and is raising you.  So, if she is useless, and she made and raised you, what does that make you?  If she is unable to accomplish anything, that would make you worthless.<br>  <br>  You are her construction.  If she is hopeless, than you must be as well, as she made you into what you are today.  If you are not hopeless, if you have worth (which I assume you do), it is to your mother's credit.  You might want to think about that for a bit.  You exist because of her - not just giving birth, but all the other crap that goes with being a parent.  And, believe me, there is a lot of crap in being the parent of a teenager!  <br>  <br>  Of course, there is a lot of crap in being a teenager as well, but you should cut her some slack.  She is probably proud of you, but to suggest that she has nothing to do with how you are is just wrong.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	Ouch.<br>  <br>  Even If I thought my daughter was a ***** I would never tell her that, b/c thats not being very mature or adult-like..and would set a bad example for her.<br>  <br>  You should be really calm, go to your mom..and make her feel like a child! tell her what she said was very innapropriate and disapointing, but you are willing to forgive her, for her immature comments. And let her know "in the future, name-calling is uneccesary"<br>  <br>  you will totally shock her by saying that..and make her feel like crap on top of it<br>  <br>  <br>  .......<br>  BUT ALSO..I forgot..you NEED to apologize for what YOU said. Thats wasn't too nice of you either, and trust me, you'll look alot more mature if you just go to her and apologize first.|`|DDFSITiYaa	So you were saying things to your mom to hurt her feelings and then she said something back and now you are all self righteous about it?   GEt over it and try treating her with respect.  You change your attitude and surprisingly, so will everyone els.e|`|ZA18KoC9aa	maybe if I was really angry and the child is rude and causing me problems day in and day out- I actually feel like that about my 17 yo brother and he annoys me and drives me crazy everyday...he is very disrespectful in my opinion|`|pnL5WTXMaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  ...oh, i needed that.|`|H0fXySX9aa	its hard to say my mum said terrible things to me in the heat of the moment as a child and was sorry after wards<br>  some times people get mad and say things they don't mean hun|`|3zg7oBA5aa	Maybe you shouldn't of been such a brat.|`|W6tShlbOaa	I would never say that to my daughter. My daughter is only 3 and I dont even wanna think about her growing up and me ever calling her a *****. I feel bad for you sweetie but all you can do is try to tell yourself that maybe she only said it out of anger and once you guys feel okay, you should sit her down and tell her that she really hurt your feelings. I hope this helps.|`|uDZZLH0Uaa	you know i have more than likely done that in the heat of an argument but many times i have regreted it.  <br>  but there are times when you get into a fight with a parent and all kinds of stuff is said with out thinking. i mean who really thinks when they are fighting with anyone... mom,brother,sister, dad. it happens. <br>  the best thing i can do is advise you from my own experience as i have raised  a daughter and shes 20 now. <br>  when you and your parent get into a heated argument just listen to what words are coming out of your mouth, stop!!! (close your mouth) <br>  and think mmmm do my words hurt the other person? do they hurt me to say them? am i raising my blood pressure over something stupid, something i (teenager) have no control over? <br>  then turn around the both of you and go in separate directions to separate rooms and close the doors behind you and have quiet time for an hour or two.. no music, no tv, just you and your thoughts in a peaceful environment. breath, take time to think about the argument you just had and figure out what you as a teenager can do to make what ever started the argument stop and never happen again.. compromise. or as a teenager realize that what ever your parent says is law until your 18 and moved out of your parents home. <br>  im sure if you follow this you may get along better in the future. <br>  <br>  cheers mystic|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Probably not...however, what you asked her was mean and belittling. If my daughters ever talked to me like that in the tone I'm pretty sure you used, I might very well say something along those lines.|`|xwOwsZvEaa	i dont think it right ur mom said something like that to u, but sometimes 15 year olds can b abit........unruly, wild, naughty and mayby, mayby u pushed her a bit to far!|`|M2yERqNSaa	you never know what youre going to say as a mother or faughter and your smart mouth would've been eating soap if you were my kid for saying something disrespectful|`|8zqmIEzVaa	maybe you shouldnt have asked if you didnt want an answer

My daughter's chunky legs were snug in it once she hit 6 months but after she became mobile and her legs slimmed out, she fit in it again.

Great purchase and it stays looking like-new since it's so easy to clean.<br>  <br>  *  It is NOT intended for bathtub or above ground use (i.e. booster seat, etc).  So, whatever you do, please keep it on floor level as a safety precaution :)
2arZOZWgaa	My kids sleep/have slept right next to me. There is no way I would ever roll over on my baby. I think the statistics are important because people need to know about the risks involved. Certain people probably shouldn't sleep with their babies. That being said, most of the world sleeps with their children. It's very unnatural to leave a small child alone in a crib.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I used to co sleep, but stopped when my roommate became my boyfriend and now sleeps with me.   long story short, he doesn't like Tresa to sleep with us..  I personally don't understand how this could happen.  I weigh 300 pounds.  I am a big woman, and my 11 week old daughter is obviously way smaller than me.  I never once FORGOT that Tresa was in bed with me, or anything like that.  There has even been times that we had to sleep with the blankets pulled over our heads because it was so cold because our house doesn't have central heating.  Granted, on those night, I didn't get very much sleep at all with trying to make sure the blanket wasn't on her face at the same time as trying to make sure she wasn't freezing.  Personally, I think you would have to be on some HEAVY drugs to not wake up if you rolled on to your child.  I wake up anyways, the moment I become uncomfortable.  I can't imagine that sleeping on the huge "lump" that would be your child would be comfortable you know?.  How could you not notice that you rolled over onto your child???  Heavy drugs, that's all I can say.  They had to have been drunk or on some kind of heavy drugs.|`|M6c0hUefaa	While my daughter was a newborn, we tried to keep her in her co-sleeper that was on my side of the bed. As time went on, she spent less and less time in there, so we started co-sleeping. I've always been an extremely light sleeper and when she was unable to roll over and move on her own, we were very safe when it came to her being in our bed. Now, she's 11 months and co-sleeps with me about half the night, sometimes more when she's in need of some cuddling. I believe co-sleeping really isn't safe for some people. A lot of people are really heavy sleepers and don't realize it, could put their child in danger. In my own situation it's good for us and helps us all get sleep, but for others it just might be something they shouldn't do.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	We don't co-sleep because my husband is an extremely heavy sleeper who has rolled over on top of me while sleeping.  To me, it's sensible to not co-sleep in this situation.<br>  <br>  However, I will occasionally co-sleep with my son alone if he's not feeling well.  I know that I am not in danger of rolling over onto him and the precautions that you take are really quite intuitive and practical.<br>  <br>  Obviously the risk of a parent accidentally smothering a child is always going to be greater in a bed than in a crib, where there is no parent to accidentally do the smothering.  But that, in itself, does not in my mind make co-sleeping dangerous.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Healthy, breastfeeding mothers do not roll onto their babies.  <br>  <br>  The big thing about co-sleeping is that it has to be done *safely*.  You can't just throw the baby into bed between you and your hubby, snuggle up with all of your quilts, take some nyquil, and fall asleep.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I think statistics are ridiculous! So many contradict each other. I think that you have to do what is right for your child and your family. My two boys have slept right beside my husband and I from the day they were born, and are always welcome to, but that's just what works for us.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	I slept with both of my younger in our bed...for 2 months both of them. The youngest then moved to her own bed as co-sleeping just was not her thing. <br>  Those statistics do not state other risk factors that were ignored by the parents. Drinking, drugs, overweight, exhaustion.....<br>  <br>  Co-sleeping can be made just as safe, if not safer than crib sleeping. There is no need for parents on either side of the debate to make excuses. if it is not what one family, or even one parent in the family, wants then it is not a good idea for that family. If the baby just will not sleep that way, then it should not be an option. There are plenty of reasons to co-sleep, but just as many not to.|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	I wanted to co-sleep, but my husband wasn't keen on that. There were many nights, though, when I fell asleep breastfeeding our daughter in bed. I woke up a few times as my arms started to relax, but it didn't take long for me to not do that-- Maternal instinct. Even now (she's 17 months), I can curl up with my daughter in a chair or the sofa as she falls asleep nursing. Some nights (which are rare) when she wakes up and stays awake for awhile, I'll go to bed and lay down and lay her on my chest. I can still fall asleep with that. My husband, though, can't fall asleep while holding her, even in a chair. <br>  <br>  I agree that those stories don't always say that the mother may have been under the influence of something. It's also those stories that seem to make headlines, I guess because co-sleeping is considered "alternative". It makes sense. Mainstream media likes to make "alternative" and hippy sounding things sound freaky. It wasn't until the past few years that "being green" wasn't even mainstream.|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	I have never co-slept with my children exclusively. Both my boys are really bad sleepers though and there have been nights when the only way anyone was going to get any sleep was if I laid down with them. I'm a VERY light sleeper. I can't even sleep in the same bed with my husband because he snores and if he even just rolled over it would wake me up. I sleep in my back with my arm around my son when we co-sleep. Basically there is no way I could ever roll over with him, much less roll over without waking up. I wouldn't ever let my husband or my mom co-sleep because I would be scared of exactly what you are talking about, but I'm comfortable doing it myself.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	sometimes I do and sometimes I don't. When he was REALLY tiny what I'd do was position my arm under him so that I could not roll over without hurting myself...so it acted as a sort of barrier. Now that he's bigger I am still careful when and if he comes to bed with us...he starts out on my chest with my laying down on my back and then when he's sleeping I roll over into my position. We do it when he's still tried but restless and then a bunch in Dec...we had an ice storm that knocked out all power... it was cold so to keep him warm we took him to bed with us...(plus the monitor wasn't working due to no power so we wanted him with us to hear him) and then when at my sis in laws (where we stayed 6 days while power was restored) it was the only way to get him to sleep later than normal so he did not disturb anyone else, and her husband keeps the place cold so it was also to keep him warm. <br>  <br>  If you're safe, sober, and drug free I don't see a problem with it. I sleep heavy, but when he's in my arms I sleep lightly...it's automatic..my body knows.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I would say that the CDC statistic is almost certainly including things which are a) not co-sleeping at all and b) certainly not SAFE co-sleeping.<br>  <br>  One of the key factors in co-sleeping is INTENT, the second is responsibility.  Every adult in the bed must be aware of, and agree to take responsibility for the infant.  Even if you and your hubby are co-sleepers never put a baby in bed with someone that is sound asleep and not expecting it (like if the adult is having a nap).<br>  <br>  Falling asleep accidentally with a baby is not co-sleeping.<br>  <br>  The following are not SAFE co-sleeping:<br>  *Parents under the influence of drugs<br>  *Parents smoke<br>  *Co-sleeping on a couch or chair (the common cause of "co-sleeping" deaths)<br>  *Unsafe bed (quilts and pillows not kept away from baby, gaps baby can become entrapped in, etc<br>  *etc.<br>  <br>  Its funny how cribs and play pens aren't blamed if:<br>  *Inappropriate blankets or pillows are used<br>  *Inappropriate mattresses are used (too small, or used in a playpen not designed for them)<br>  *Improperly built or maintained cribs<br>  *bumber pads<br>  *etc<br>  <br>  And yet every baby that falls asleep in an adult bed regardless of whose bed or why or how unsafe the bed is, and every baby that falls asleep near an adult or older child no matter where, how unsafe the situation is or how impaired the adult is is considered a co-sleeping death.<br>  <br>  Its also remarkable how studies conducted in cultures where co-sleeping is the norm find it safer than solitary sleep.  Now of course those studies are biased as well -all studies are somewhat biased.  But the bias is greater when money is involved which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics who gets a lot of funding from the baby product industry (including cribs, formula, and medicine) is often vastly different than American Academy of Family Physicians when it comes to issues involving breastfeeding, baby sleep locations, pacifiers, etc.<br>  <br>  Also given the fact that some studies show that about 80% of babies co-sleep at least part-time even 300 over two years is really actually low given 2500 babies die of SIDS each year.  6% or less of babies would have to be co-sleeping (or 6% or less of all babies total sleep hours would have to be spent cosleeping to account for the partial crib users) before the 300 stat would be troubling, if those 300 are real SIDS deaths.  Even if they are true "accidental deaths" by overlaying then you would still have to compare the percentage of babies that die in crib "sleep hours" vs the percentage that die in "bed sleep hours".  You'd also have to take into account the age of the babies.<br>  <br>  So to find a valid comparison you would have to do something similar to the following:<br>  *Get 100,000 babies and start the day they turn two months and study until the day they turn 5 months (2-4 months is the peak for SIDS).  All would have to come from families with similar incomes, education, access to medical care, ethnic backgrounds, etc as all impact SIDS rates.  And even studying 100,000 babies you would only get a very small number of SIDS deaths so you couldn't try to compensate for these differences after wards in only those that died of SIDS.<br>  *Give the parents accurate and unbiased information on crib safety and bedsharing safety.  Not that all the parents will use it of course, but they should at least be equally informed on how to do both safely<br>  *Set up night-vision cameras on the crib, parental bed, couch, chairs, swings, etc -anywhere the baby could potentially sleep.  This is because patient observations are notoriously inaccurate, particularly for something that the patient believes is "bad" like co-sleeping or drug use<br>  *Then you would be able to determine with accuracy how much time babies spend in sleep location.  <br>  <br>  The of course you'd have to take the babies that died, look at where they were when they died.  And also take into account any difference just before they died in SIDS.  Some studies show an increase in SIDS deaths after the DTaP vaccines, so you'd need to either preclude those or make sure that after vaccines the rate of bedsharing didn't go up or down.  Illnesses cause an increase in SIDS and again usually an increase in bedsharing.  Also one or two studies have found that babies that commonly use a pacifier are far more likely to not have used one for their "last sleep" (their term, not mine).  So you'd have to see if babies that use a pacifier in a crib don't in the bed, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  =========================<br>  Why babies should never sleep alone: A review<br>  of the co-sleeping controversy in relation to SIDS,<br>  bedsharing and breast feeding<br>  <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/articles/McKenna_why%20babies%20should%20n.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/articles...</a><br>  or <a href="http://ncane.com/zan" rel="nofollow">http://ncane.com/zan</a> (that url tends to break if so use the ncane one)<br>  <br>  Sleeping Through the Night<br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepthrough.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepth...</a><br>  <br>  CO-SLEEPING: YES, NO, SOMETIMES?<br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://womantowomancbe.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/co-sleeping-bed-sharing-sids-etc/" rel="nofollow">http://womantowomancbe.wordpress.com/200...</a><br>  Currently, however, it is considered poor parenting, and possibly even dangerous, to let your baby sleep with you. Dr. McKenna is not suggesting that all forms of bed-sharing are risk-free; however, he is lobbying hard for its condemnation to be removed, and more scrutiny given to deaths that occur when infants sleep with their parents. One study he quotes says,<br>  <br>      Almost all SIDS deaths associated with parental bedsharing occurred in conjunction with a history of parental drug use and occurred in association with the prone [on the tummy instead of on the back] sleep position or sleep surfaces such as a couch or waterbed.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/311/7015/1269" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/311/...</a><br>  There is great controversy about bed sharing and the sudden infant death syndrome. Our study confirmed that significantly more Latin American and African-American parents and infants than white families routinely slept together. For infants who died from the syndrome 45 deaths occurred while sharing a bed. There was a weak association between bed sharing and the sudden infant death syndrome (odds ratio 1.21 night, 1.38 day), which was not significant when potential confounders were adjusted for. In our study bed sharing was not a major risk factor for the syndrome. Sample size calculations indicate that 200 matched sets would require an odds ratio of 2.9 for a significance level of P<0.05 and 80% power.<br>  <br>  Five studies have reported that bed sharing, usually in combination with maternal smoking or alcohol consumption, was a risk factor for the sudden infant death syndrome.5 6 7 8 9 We found no interactive effect between bed sharing and maternal use of alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drugs. In contrast, studies based solely on Asian populations reported lower rates of the syndrome with bed sharing.*RF 15, 16, 17, 18*<br>  <br>  Unlike the aforementioned studies, our study accounted for routine bed sharing during the day and night. The comparison of routine bed sharing rather than sharing just at the time of death reduced the risk of confounding due to illness. Bed sharing at death was independently ascertained rather than using bed sharing over the last two weeks of life as a routine measure of bed sharing.7 In previous studies control infants were absent8 or poorly selected.9 Most importantly, adjustment for salient maternal and infant characteristics was not performed in other studies.5 8 10 We adjusted for confounders not dealt with previously,18 including passive smoking, intercom use, maternal education, recreational drug use, and any neonatal medical conditions. Diagnoses of the sudden infant death syndrome differed between this study and that of Scragg et al, which included infants with abnormalities,7 and Carpenter's, which included infants up to 2 years of age and had an 80% necropsy rate.*RF 5* To our knowledge, although Scragg et al compared bed sharing among Maori and Pacific Islanders,7 ours is the first study to examine it among four racial groups in the United States.<br>  <br>  Recall bias may have been a problem in this study because the Human Subjects Committee required a delay before we interviewed case parents. A subsample (50%) of interviews with parents of infants who died was compared with reports from the scene of death, and the agreement rate was very high. In addition, 10 mothers and fathers from each group underwent separate interviews, resulting in a very high agreement rate for all infant characteristics and information at the scene of death. Furthermore, control infants may have been older than their corresponding cases when their parents were interviewed. Each control infant's age corresponded to the case infant's age for particular events including vaccinations, illnesses, and breast feeding practices. During the interview, the sleeping arrangement during infancy was always specified. Recall bias was minimised because bed sharing was not the primary hypothesis, a standardised interview was used for all parents, and great attention was devoted to the interview technique, including ordering of questions based on a time line corresponding with life events from pregnancy through birth.<br>  <br>  Although bed sharing occurs in about 90% of the world population, western industrialised societies consider solitary infant sleep a normal and desirable arrangement.3 In fact, infants are expected to exhibit adult sleep profiles by 3-4 months of age.19 There are, however, potential benefits to bed sharing. Parents sleeping with their infants inadvertently provide stimulation through vocalisations, body movements, radiant heat, respiratory sounds, odours, and possibly expired gases.3 Infants who share the parents' bed arise more frequently and simultaneously with the mother and spend less time in stage three to four of quiet sleep.3<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/107/3/530" rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cg...</a><br>  The det|`|lGcpXteaaa	I co-slept from my daughters birth until she was 6 months old.

Babies move alot in their sleep and if a parent is sleeping and does not feel the baby move, they may think it is just sleeping sound.<br>  <br>  Was so painful to family almost split it apart also.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I really wished to co sleep with my baby & breastfeed my baby in the bed but it did not work for me. Like other moms said, every moms & babies are different. For some people, co sleeping would work so well. For me, not so well because I'm a heavy sleeper so I don't feel too comfortable sleeping with my baby our bed. <br>  <br>  I think moms should figure out if it works for them or not. Don't do it because others do it but if you feel that it will be safe then, it will be safe.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I did co-sleep. I was/am a very light sleeper, a mouse could fart and I would wake up. All I have to say about the statistic is, its just that a statistic. Every woman is different, every child is different and every situation is different.

We aren't even going to get a crib for our baby. we have a papasan next to our bed to use as a crib and our bed with us. cribs scare me, I remember watching my little brothers climb out of them when i was young and wondering why that was safer then just being on a bed...|`|VrPyp1APaa	I co-sleep and my son is 5 months old and I have never had problems with it.

However, if she's very ill or has a rough night, we bring her to bed with us.  We've never rolled over on her but it IS a possibility and I think many parents should consider that when co-sleeping.  She's over a year old now so the few times a month she comes to bed, we aren't worried since she can move herself around and we'd sense her.  I think the big problem is with newborns, since they are so tiny and cant move on their own.  Blankets can also smother a child. <br>  <br>  The way I see it, the safest thing for the child is the crib.  Sleeping in the bed once in a while is OK but shouldn't become a habit.|`|7fd087382fbb2c34d1c9ed80fc569c6faa	wow thats crazy! poor little man :( but anyways my daughter just turned a month old yesterday and she has been sleeping in the bed with me and my husband pretty much sense day 1. i tried to put her in a bassinet next to my bed but she didnt like that she likes to cuddle :) but i make sure she sleeps next to me cause my husband moves around alot i pretty much just stay in 1 position the entire night though. we have not had any problems and i hope we dont she usually just gets swaddled so our blankets dont end up covering her face or something and goes to sleep sometimes she has her own space and sometimes she sleeps right on top of me.|`|CE3bmj65aa	I sleep with my baby most nights and I make it where it is not possible to roll over on him.  I have him between the wall and then on the other side I have a rolled up blanket and then me.  I don't see how a mom could roll over on her own baby without waking up unless she was drunk, on drugs, or a very heavy sleeper and in which case shouldn't be co-sleeping in the first place.  If my son makes the slightest peep I wake.  I think as long as you do it safely there is no problem.  Think of how many babies die from SIDS, the rate is much higher.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I co-slept with my son from the time he was 3 months until about 6 months-He just didn't seem to care for it.<br>  <br>  I co-slept with my daughter starting at 3 months, until she was 9 months. Although I am "pro-cosleeping," I know first hand things can happen. I woke up every time my daughter made a sound or moved an inch, until one night I didn't-And she crawled off my bed, hit her head, and actually ended up "stuck" under my bed. I took her to the DR the next day, and she was (luckily) fine.<br>  <br>  IMO, co-sleeping is best done after a baby can move their head and possibly roll over, and before they can crawl. I am not worried about mothers rolling onto their babies (unless they have been drinking or are overweight), to me the biggest danger is the baby falling off the bed.|`|qsjGSXaRaa	The raised issue with co-sleeping being a safety hazard is so strange to me. There are ways to make it work if co-sleeping is one's choice. I've never come even close to rolling over onto my baby, just as I have never come close to rolling off the bed nor rolling over onto my baby's daddy! <br>  <br>  As for me, I never place my back to my baby, thereby preventing any possibility of rolling over onto her. Whichever side I lay on, she's in front of me and she sleeps with her own blanket (swaddled); I sleep with my own blanket, thereby preventing any risk of suffocation to her from the blankets...another issue raised by anti-co-sleepers. <br>  <br>  Without co-sleeping, my baby would be awake every hour and would end up sleeping on her tummy (she's been able to roll over onto her stomach since 2.5 months!) and I'd be one miserable human being to live with during the day!|`|AA10167940	In nearly all of those cases, the parent was on medication, had been drinking or taking drugs when the incidents occurred.

28QPS6V9aa	Yes you could be pregnant and the depo shot is only effective if taken properly. You're supposed to wait about a month after having the shot to have unprotected sex. My husband and I didn't know this and ended up getting pregnant a few weeks after I got the shot. But the good news is the shot didn't have any negative effect on the baby. You should get tested and if you are pregnant have an ultrasound done right away just to make sure the shot didn't do any damage to your baby.|`|YnG0Tjxjaa	I don't know much about Yaz, but I did take the depo shot. Honestly, I am less than a fan. It made me very weak initially. It's not fully tested, as the nurse who administered the shot told me. I don't know why I didn't turn back there. I was very sick for a month. Stomach illness and such. My period was very irregular. I had it for a month straight. I also lost my sex drive. I've been off of the shot for four months and I still don't have my sex drive back. Also, if you don't react well with the shot, there's nothing they can do to reverse it. It stays in your body for three months. I advise against it. I went back to the pill for a bit, and still wasn't feeling so hot. I'm just sticking to being natural with my monthly, who took awhile to regulate itself.<br>  <br>  Now, I have heard the shot works with other people who experienced no problems, but I've also heard many cases where it has been a problem for most.|`|AA11784984	Here is what my doctor said ( i am also on depo) He said that after you 2nd shot if you continue to get periods then you have a chance to get pregnant.

I don't get my period and I have been on the shot for 3 years and it hasn't failed.|`|liHpJvVfaa	I have known about 3 girls that have gotten pregnant off the Depo Shot.I would never get put on that birth control.

Then you will end up with a retarded and damaged baby... NOT a spontaneous abortion.<br>  <br>  Did you lie to your doctor when s/he gave you the shot? Because when I was on Depo... My doctor asked me when my last period was and when the last time I had sex was to make sure that by giving me the shot, she was not going to cause problems in case of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I was told that the hormones of the shot combined with the hormones released during pregnancy could screw up the baby...<br>  <br>  As with all medication and chemicals... It takes time for the full effects of the shot to occur. <br>  <br>  If you had the shot yesterday and had unprotected sex today, you CAN get pregnant. <br>  <br>  BTW...

qHa4w8eyaa	Your period is 3 weeks late and you haven't tested yet?  Wow!  You are one patient lady!  Now reward yourself and go get that HPT - preferably the most reliable you can find.  Best of luck! :)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well if you aren't pregnant then a negative test will be disappointing today and just as disappointing if you take it a week from now...so just get it over with.  Also the stress of wanting to be pregnant can make your body have symptoms.|`|Fv51bELraa	wait at least five days to seven days. if you still on get ur period do the pregnancy test. good luck|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Well i would do a test personally but try your hardest not to get hopes up : )|`|eytlIKITaa	I know how you feel- My husband and I have been TTC for 10 cycles and I'm so tired of being disappointed... Just take a test... It is or it isn't...  Good luck!  Baby dust to us!|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	Wait another week, and if you still don't have anything I'd try an at home test.  If it's negative and still no sign of AF call your OBGYN and they'll set you up for a blood test.
bspRfskYaa	Buy some ready made pizza bases and cut up some different vegetables (peppers, onion, etc) and ask him to help you arrange them on the pizza and then hopefully when its cooked he will try some as pizza is something he recognises and as he has helped prepare the food, he should be more interested in it.<br>  Hope this helps|`|vue9NOhYaa	Stop cooking special meals for him.  As long as he knows he'll get junk and 'kiddy food' why should he bother to try anything else.<br>  <br>  Make regular meals for the family.  Offer enough choices that there will be SOMETHING he likes, if he tries.  Then, don't make a fuss. Don't force him or bribe him or punish him.  If he's hungry, he eats.  If he isn't, he doesn't. If he pitches a fit, he leaves the table.   When the next meal rolls around, he'lll likely be hungrier and willing to try that scary pork chop or sweet potato.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	he may be too young for salad but try stuff like collards,turnips my boys love those. Lots of fruits are good.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Try mixing in healthy stuff into his fun stuff.  My son (17 months) loves fresh spinach chopped up fine and put into cottage cheese.  We season just the spinach leaves with garlic-pepper seasoning.<br>  <br>  Make healthy food fun, like with my oldest, we called fresh brocolli "trees".  Dishes like chinese food that have lots of veggies get children used to the colors to eat.  Dips like ranch and french onion make the veggies taste good, and can be reduced over a period of time.<br>  <br>  Also, strawberry jello (we use sugar-free) mixed in with cranberries and Splenda type sweetner tastes great (1 bag fresh cranberries, 1 large package SF strawberry jello, 1/2 cup sugar equivalent).  <br>  <br>  Most kids like pickles, which are cucumbers flavored up.  When they find out that they're cucumbers, mine wanted to try a fresh cucumber.  By making veggies into finger foods, thin slices, and easy to eat, they become more fun.  Also, absolutely no desserts or new toys until they try something.  I know kids absolutely don't like some things, so our rule is, try it 3 times in a row.  If they still don't like it, wait 3-6 months and try it again.<br>  <br>  A lot of kids like coldslaw.  My youngest doesn't have the junk foods, unless it's a treat when we go out.  Quite frankly, he doesn't like them very well.|`|Wpmkdwvtaa	I has the same exact problem with my 4 year old i would cook seprerate meals for him and i got so fed up with his picky eating i just stopped catering to him and i made him eat what we ate, it was really hard for him at first he would even pretend like he was throwing up cause he hated vegtebles but after a while i think he got tired of not eating and going to bed on an empty stomache because he refused to eat what i cooked and he eventually came through, he still likes to try and be picky about some stuff but i let him know if you do not eat dinner you will not have dessert or anyhting else to eat and thats usually enough for him to to finish what i served him. He even asks for seconds sometimes so its gonna be hard at first but its about breaking him out of that cylce hes used to,,,, botttom line is he eats what you cook or he dosent eat at all!!|`|3w7VztEWaa	put some nuggets in the salad and see if he eats that|`|b6EyFLgUaa	You are not a restaurant, if he doesn't eat what the rest of the family eats he doesn't eat. he'll pick and wine for a few days but finally understand that if he doesn't eat what everyone else eats he doesn't eat. My daughter is 2 and she eats the same thing her dad and I eat. My sisters father would give her special meals when we were little because she was a picky eater, she never tried new things and still really doesn't it drives me insane and she at 19 asks me to make her something different. Last time i laughed and told her no she can eat what i made or go hungry, she ate it and loved it.|`|zl0YHMD5aa	Make him eat like a hot dog but underneath but salad . Or tell him if he eats his salad he will get unhealthy food the next day.Or say if you don't eat your salad you will go to bed early if he eats his salad he can go half an hour later for bed.<br>  <br>  i hope my advice helps<br>  <br>  Amz x|`|kYFtoVpXaa	Make him a chicken salad, or be creative, put (sounds gross) hot dogs in it. Or you can make a pasta salad.|`|NSLE4JImaa	haggis
RPszYGXkaa	If you are testing before AF is due, then yes, use first morning urine.  IF you haven't gone to the bathroom during the night, your urine in the morning generally has the highest concentration of HCG.<br>  Once you are late for AF, generally urine from any part of the day is good, as long as it isn't diluted by drinking too much water, etc.<br>  Baby dust!<br>  <br>  FYI - the digitals generally have a sensitivity of at least 50, so it is sometimes better to go with a general early result test like FR, which has a higher sensitivity level|`|JjBwydymaa	Test in your first morning wee.. especially in very early pregnancy as yout HCG levels arnt very high.<br>  <br>  Also I would suggest you wait until you miss your period...because you still may get a false negative..<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck hunni xx|`|34YAS4a0aa	first thing in the morning! good luck!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Do it first thing after you wake up in the morning.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	in the morning so the urine is fresh .|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Read the instructions on box!!|`|yp9rEMSraa	I would definitely take it in the morning for the first pee...It is still so early if you are going to get a BFP it would be with the first pee....Best of luck and hope you are!

WWcaKZ7Qaa	Hmm, if I were you I would just get together a bunch of his favorite things and have those for him, even if they are little things like candies, drinks, etc. Maybe you could also cook him his favorite meal or something as well. And like you said, you can never go wrong with sex...lol. So maybe some lingerie too if he likes that sort of thing! :]|`|vR4oTlKAaa	get everybody that you know together for a coming home party and a barbeque, and afterwards maybe a hotel jaccuzzi suite at a motel for the weekend for some together time. write a poem to read to him at the get together in front of family and friends and encourage them to do the same....That would be my ideas or a few of them anywayz I hope this helps you out...good luck and GOD BLESS ALL THE SOLDIERS|`|HdOVYIWjaa	Try cooking him his favorite meal.  Take the phones off the hook so it's just you and him.  Maybe pick him up something that he has been eying for some time, like a movie or cologne.  Whip up a nice dessert that you can share, maybe in the bedroom? Strawberries with whipped cream and some champagne,  maybe even get a nice little outfit to express how much you missed him.|`|ZOQnUQGsaa	sexy photos....<br>  <br>  There are places you can go to have your own photo shoot. and do classy sexy photos for him...<br>  <br>  nothing pornographic, just sexy......

HXfHkoSHaa	I got my daughter's done at 5 months.  They need to be at least 3 months for the immunizations.  I found that getting it done early allowed me to keep them clean.  And she was so young that she didn't fool with them at all.  She's 2 now, almost 3, and has never had even an inkling of an infection, and she loves her earrings.  I really don't know of any girls that don't like them, and since she got them done as a baby she doesn't remember any pain associated with it.  Besides, she cried for only a couple of seconds.  Much less than she has for shots. <br>  <br>   I called around before I got them done. I didn't want just anybody to do it.  They don't pierce ears at our pediatrician's office anymore, but may at yours.  I ended up at Claire's and the manager who had been there for many years did it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I don't like ear piercing in infants for two reasons: 1) It's a choking hazard if they somehow get the earring out and 2) Babies pull on their ears and yours will at first if it's painful. A little girl that went to the daycare I use to work at pulled on her earring so hard it ripped through her earlobe. It wasn't pretty after that.<br>  <br>  "any advice please i want to make sure i do what is safest for her..."<br>  <br>  Then wait until she's old enough to ask for earrings and old enough to care for them herself. I do realize it's your decision in the end, of course, so if you insist on doing it then speak to her pediatrician about what age is the safest and where to get them done at.|`|t93CQekvaa	waite until she is older. dont be stupid|`|rpsXPdFmaa	You want to be safe for her then don't pierce her ears as an infant.  You don't even know if she wants her ears pierced.  My husband works at a hospital and he's seen several little girls who have ripped their earlobes because Mommy thought it was cute to pierce her ears.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Since you're doing something that's going to leave a permanent mark on her body, shouldn't she be allowed to make that choice when she's older?|`|AA10500537	wait til shes old enough and let her decide <br>  there;s more important things to care for a baby|`|qQsFTkWmaa	i got mine done at age 7.. i asked .. actuslly begged..<br>  <br>  we left them in cept for cleaning for 2 years.. now i can go years and years without them and them pop them in no problem...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  so she dosent have to be a infsnt for the permenat holes benefit<br>  <br>  i belive in waiting for ear piercing...<br>  <br>  ask your Dr...<br>  <br>  <br>  also i think it looks tacky|`|DDFSITiYaa	I waited until they were old enough to ask for their ears to be pierced.|`|Yba724Wkaa	congrats on baby! I have a baby who turned four weeks this past friday.<br>  <br>  I have another daughter who is 9 i had her ears done when she was 2 months and what a mistake that was I will not do my newborns at least for a few years. I had my oldest daughters done at the mall and the way they do it with the piercing gun is bad for the lobes. not everyone is bothered by it so their will be people who say it was just fine i myself had my done at a place like Claire's when I was an infant. My daughters ear kept getting infected no matter how well it was kept clean and pure the gold was they just bothered her. I had them done for the third time at a real piercing place and oh what the difference. no problems! I will wait with my youngest little girl.
HdOVYIWjaa	sometimes when you start taking birth control pills you will feel nausea and may feel different.  If you took that many pregnancy tests and all came back negative, you're probably not pregnant.  If you are really nervous, go back to your doctor and have another blood pregnancy test, it's the most sensitive and will tell you the quickest.
AA10315542	yes.  It is so lightweight, that it is easy for the toddler to suck it down their airway.|`|AA11537580	no popcorn for children under 5|`|OXSOch9Oaa	Yes.

I also read that the rule of thumb for snacks for toddlers is that you can give them just about anything that will dissolve in water. I've given it to my daughter, and she loves it.  I would suggest you ask your doctor just to be sure.|`|3zm0jA0yaa	I just wouldn't give it to them. theres a kernel in it and could bet stuck along with some of the popcorn. there are just so many other things you could give them.

f1e593fccac158ae80c8df2916388085aa	WHen I had my miscarriage at 7 weeks, I had some serious cramping all day.  SInce it was my first pregnancy, I wasn't suspicious and thought that it was normal.  I was wrong.  As the cramping continued through the day, I decided to go to the restroom to check it out.  I have never seen so much blood pour from me! (I am sorry if TMI) It was draining down my leg and I couldn't stop it.  On top of all this, I was at work and I had been dropped off so I couldn't leave and drive.  Just as I was about to call an ambulance, my husband happened to think I wanted lunch and showed up at my job.  <br>  <br>  To make a long story short, all of this was 4 days before Christmas in 2006 when Christmas fell on a Monday.  That means that the Doctors (and everywhere else) was closed on Friday, Saturday, SUnday, and Monday.  The ER told me to be on complete bedrest for the entire four days and see my doctor on Tuesday Morning.  When Tuesday got there, the bleeding had stopped.  I was optimistic and thought the baby was still there and that maybe we had a chance.  I was wrong. My doctor said nothing was left but placenta tissue.  ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, this happened 5 days before my wedding on December 30, 2006. <br>  <br>  Sorry the story was so long, Some women have silent miscarriages and others don't.  <br>  <br>  It took 2 years to get to where I am now though...This is my first pregnancy since the incident described above.  I am currently 4 weeks pregnant and I am trying to be optimistic but it is so hard not to worry.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	There are a lot of causes of miscarriages. Mostly just your body sencing that something is wrong with the pregnancy and ending it. It will hurt A LOT. I woke up one morning and saw some bleeding with small blood clots and went to the ER. They did an ultrasound and didn't see a heartbeat. Also the baby was supposed to be 10 weeks but was measuring 8 weeks. They gave me pain medication and told me to go home and that I will be having a complete miscarriage soon. EVerything passed a few days later. I had another ultrasound and they saw everything was out. <br>  <br>  8 years before I had a miscarriage while on vacation in Brazil and never went to the doctor. I knew I had a miscarriage, but didn't get a follow up ultrasound.|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	I had spotting then sharp cramping with my first miscarriage.  The second time I didn't know the baby had died for 2 weeks and had to have a D&C to remove the dead fetal tissue.  I had some cramping with it, but nothing like the first miscarriage.  I bled both times for 7-10 days.|`|uX4FDZnvaa	hmmm well my experience of my 3 they were all diferent!<br>  <br>  Molar pregnancy - (physical) VERY painful pains and couldnt handle it, TONNES of blood, had to go to hospital because of it and have a d&c to get it out. <br>  <br>  Miscarriage - (physical) pain and bleeding cant remember much of this one really.<br>  <br>  Missed miscarriage - (physical) Very bad waves of pain every 5 minutes for about 5-6 hours and then i went to the toilet and it come out in one big thing (sorry tmi). the pain was gone completly as soon as it came out.<br>  <br>  The symptoms i got before everyone of my miscarriages were:<br>  <br>  my pregnancy symptoms went<br>  and EXTREME lower backpain (omg it was so bad lol )<br>  <br>  i prefer to miscarry naturally than have d&c.<br>  <br>  ow and also some people do not know they have a miscarriage they could think its just a late period.<br>  <br>  But the people that do know they were pregnant but have a miscarriage find out there baby had died at the scan, i did with all 3.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	there is such a thing as a missed miscarriage, where they baby dies but there is no bleeding so mum doesn't know until a hospital check where they won't detect a heart beat.  In this case a D&C will be performed, much like an abortion.  Alternatively a miscarriage can involve bleeding, cramping and be quite painful and leave you in no doubt that it is a miscarriage|`|d89qNyb6aa	I found this for you...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/miscarriage.html" rel="nofollow">http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you're O.K x|`|LxrsG8ifaa	Miscarriages can be caused by a lot of things. The most common cause is genetic or chromosomal defects that would cause the embryo not to be viable.<br>  <br>  In most cases, women who miscarry (depending on how far along they are) experience cramping and passing clots. <br>  <br>  If you went to the hospital and suspected you were pregnant, they would estimate how far along you thought you were. most doctors will not do an initial ultrasound before 8-10 weeks. If the baby was not dead they would continue with routine prenatal treatment. If they thought you were having a miscarriage they would inform you and possibly put you on bedrest.|`|Wps4XuqHaa	My miscarriage caused me no problems at all. I had no cramps or bleeding. I didnt find out till my 12 week scan that my baby had passed away 3 weeks before :( xx|`|0MwaMLeyaa	some people miscarry with out knowing
S1LxX6CNaa	Pregnancy Old Wives Tales<br>  Anyone who has ever been pregnant has had to suffer through a supersitition or two. We decided to put together a few pregnancy and TTC old wives tales. How do we know if these tales are myth or truth? We asked a few old wives!!!<br>  <br>  ~ Old Wives Tale #1 ~<br>  Drano Test <br>  Myth: I've heard that you can take a pregnant woman's urine and mix it with drano to tell the sex of the baby. I hear that it's 100% accurate.<br>  <br>  Truth: The drano test supposedly can detect something in a pregnant woman's urine that will change the color of the drano to indicate the gender of the baby. However, this is false.<br>  <br>  Comments: Lots of people swear this is true and offer their own personal experiences to back it up, but the sum of all the anecdotes you hear and read still don't add up to proof.<br>  <br>  Reminder: If you do attempt this PLEASE use a glass container. Fumes are strong so pee in the jar and then do the draino test in a well ventilated area.<br>  <br>  "The Prediciton Key" to interpreting the Drano test:<br>  <br>  Bluish yellow = boy<br>  Greenish brown = girl<br>  <br>  Brownish = boy <br>  No change = girl<br>  <br>  Brown = boy <br>  Green = girl<br>  <br>  Black = boy <br>  Blue = girl<br>  <br>  Blue = boy<br>  Green = girl<br>  <br>  <br>  ~ Old Wives Tale #2 ~<br>  To Get A Girl<br>  <br>  Myth: You can do any or all of the following things to get a girl.<br>  <br>  Truth: These things certainly can be fun so why not?<br>  <br>  If You Want a Girl...<br>  <br>  1. Both parents should eat a lot of fish and veggies. <br>  <br>  2. Eat chocolate and other sweets. (Yeah right, like we need that excuse, lol) <br>  <br>  3.Do the baby dance when the moon is full. <br>  <br>  4. Make time for a nooner. <br>  <br>  5. Go horse back riding... make love with the woman on top.<br>  <br>  6. Give the old missionary position try.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~ Old Wives Tale #3 ~<br>  To Get A Boy<br>  <br>  Myth: Doing, one, all or things in combination can get you a boy.<br>  <br>  Truth: Why not?<br>  <br>  If You Want a Boy...<br>  <br>  1. Eat more meat (the redder the better). <br>  <br>  2. Salty snacks, such as: pretzels, chips, peanuts ect...<br>  <br>  3. Dads to be must injest Cola Drinks!<br>  <br>  4. Linger in bed a bit after sex, gives the boy sperm a chance to beat the girl sperm to the egg. <br>  <br>  5. Make love standing up. (ohhhh!) <br>  <br>  6. Try the rear-entry position. :) <br>  <br>  7. Focus on meeting your mans needs, if the male partner climaxes first, old wives' tale says you're guaranteed a boy.<br>  <br>  8. It has been known that when it is the time you are ovulating and the man asks for sex, it is a sure fire for a boy! <br>  <br>  9. Ladies, sleeping to the left of your partner should do the trick! <br>  <br>  10. Stand on one leg, hop in a circle 4 times while rubbing your belly and head singing 'Joy To The World'....ok we just made this one up to see if you were paying attention! Old wives do that sort of thing you know!<br>  <br>  <br>  ~ Old Wives Tale #4 ~<br>  Gender Predictions<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Myths:<br>  "If you're carrying your baby high, it's a girl. If you're carrying your baby low, it's a boy." <br>  <br>  "If you're craving sweets, you're having a girl. If you're craving salt, you're having a boy." <br>  <br>  "If a wedding ring or needle suspended over your belly moves in a strong circular motion, you're having a girl. If it moves to and fro like a pendulum, you're having a boy." <br>  <br>  "A heartrate of less than 140 beats per minute means that you're having a boy and a heartrate of over 140 beats per minutes means that you're having a girl."<br>  <br>  Truth:<br>  <br>  None of these methods are 100% accurate. They are however fun to speculate with.|`|FASzVGrraa	wow that is crazy! i have never hard of that either! i think someone who is preggo or just found out they are they should try it an let us know the results! it could be cheaper haha! (:|`|yDWcYXl5aa	An Amish farrier (horse shoer) taught me how to tell if my mares were carrying a male or female.  Well-the same principal works on almost every child I've tried it on, except it didn't work on the child I adopted.  His first mom didn't want to hear or see the ultrasound, because she felt it would make her closer to the baby she knew she couldn't keep.  We did the test, and it showed a girl.  When he came out healthy, it absolutely didn't matter.<br>  <br>  To do the test, a nail is tied onto the end of a piece of thread.  If it goes hip to hip, it's a girl, and if it goes along the spine (up & down) it's a boy.  It's 99% accurate.|`|Tw7o2Uagaa	There's one called a doctor.|`|uX4FDZnvaa	wow that is like well crazy. not sure whether its true or not.<br>  <br>  My opinion i prefer just the normal pregnancy test or doctors blood tests or something so i dont get messed around.|`|RJHB8TvOaa	old wives tale<br>  sorry
TQW5E6olaa	I'm so sorry to hear that! They'll keep her until she's improved enough to be without professional care.<br>  <br>  I always bring her blanket, a stuffed animal, a favorite book, pj's, my Ipod and stereo with her fav music, my laptop and dvds.<br>  <br>  Hope she gets better soon!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	awwww sorry hun! bring her own pajamas, her own blankets and a favorite toy or two. Hope she gets well soon!|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Bring her pillows and blankets. PJ's. HER snackes, juice, coloring books.<br>  They'll probably keep her until her fever goes down.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	they will keep her until her fever breakes then they might do a spinal to make sure its nothing seriouse. and all you realy can bring is you! maybe her fav blanket just being there will make her feel better nobody can do it like mommy!|`|uwQYKO1baa	You do NOT need the burden of too many items. Don't worry about things & packing..etc. She just needs YOU!!!  Mommy is all the comfort she needs. And remember to take care of yourself also, your no good to her if your exausted!! God Bless|`|lY2XI8kUaa	bring her her favorite toys, and clothes. they probably will keep her till her fever stays down. i hope she starts to feel better soon|`|a542089275b25ddd7ac22d67bf412133aa	Just went through this with my 2 yr old. She has to be fever free for 24 hours before you can go home.  Take her fav movies, toys blanket or lovey toy.  Good luck.
Ni6lU11Raa	I am sure you have gotten enough answers but i will say  yes also  my daughter is 13 months and has 9 teeth and 1 more on the way as we speak. but if it seems consistent i am more then willing to bet he is waking up hungry|`|2qjgS99Qaa	yes its very possible... love on him and give him some orajel... only during the day NEVER 30 min before he naps or sleeps... their throat can get numb and choke on their own saliva... also his tummy might be upset when my daughter was teething she had bad diareaha so she was always up...|`|v4f1oqOCaa	definately teething :) congratulations. now what you need are some frozen washclothes, pediasure freezer pops, and a whole lot of drool rags!!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	by 13 months my daughter had 6 teeth.|`|YHdjNv87aa	yes a baby can start at any age my 4 month old daughter is teething and my 21 month old daughter is getting her last 2 teeth.|`|AA11210211	umm yeah,My daughter is 12 months and she has only 4 teeth and a new one is coming in right now.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	sure he can|`|nyCW1Xt5aa	Oh yes try putting origel on his teeth b4 you go to bed while he is asleep and that should help. Also he might be hungry still so try to give him some oat mill before he goes to bed . I know it sounds weird but it work.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Absolutely.  The teething tablets work really great, and if it's consistent waking up, a dose of ibuprofen drops before bedtime might be in order.|`|AA10747002	Yes, my nephew is sprouting his second tooth at 9 months.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	my youngest son got his first tooth at 4mths, by the time he was 13mths he had 6 teeth. It is definitely possible. try rubbing some ambesol and if he stops crying you know that was the problem.
mx3gFmIKaa	OK in the US the MMR is no longer available seperately.  The booster is given between 4-6 years old.<br>  <br>  95 percent of mumps is asymptomatic, its a self limiting disease treated at home with tylenol and it runs its course.<br>  <br>  Having an extra anything when you don't need it due to immunity is unnecessary and can cause side effects.<br>  <br>  Have titers drawn.  This should be routine for anybody anyways.  95 percent of people receive immunity  from the first MMR especially if it was administered after 15 months old.  Initial MMR is given between 12-18 months but studies show it has reduced efficacy if given before 15 months.<br>  <br>  and I don't know about that not making a difference you having had mumps, it is maybe possible to get passive immunity from it<br>  <br>  That is great that you can get the shots seperately, so many people here is the US would really like that option.  I would get the titers drawn first for safety's sake.  The measles is the most important one followed by rubella, and then the mumps.  <br>  <br>  If I had a daughter who had never had any problems with vaccines I would get the titers drawn first, then if she didn't have immunity I would get them seperately 1 at a time starting with measles.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Yes, she should. She won't die from mumps, but is she catches it while pregnant there's a strong chance her baby will be deaf - and if she gives it to a non-vaccinated partner/husband it will be very unpleasant for him (it goes to the testes) and can leave him sterile.<br>  <br>  And you do know just how little testing there's been done on the safety and efficiency of single vaccines in small children, right?|`|qq5nceCXaa	Have the MMR.<br>  <br>  This has been tested repeatedly and been shown to be safe, which is more than can be said for the interactions between the separate injections, although it would have been carded if any issue came up (in the UK GP's are required to report any suspicious reactions).<br>  <br>  You having mumps doesn't really signify, it's about immunity in your child.  If she didn't have any adverse reaction to the single dose injections it's highly unlikely that she will to an MMR jab.  The reason for the second is that immunity arises in approximately 89-90% after the first does and that goes up to over 95% after the second, this is due to the very low level of stimulation the jab gives to the immune system, so low that some people don't react.<br>  <br>  The Wakefield report has been highly discredited, and in fact never even established a link between MMR and autism, that was something he said in a press conference not the report.  If your concerned speak to your GP, look on the NHS direct website and stay away from the cranky non evidence based panic sites.|`|7at1Hyn8aa	If her doctor wants to give her the combo booster, go ahead.  An extra dose of something she is already immune to wont make a difference.<br>  <br>  (And you having the mumps, makes no difference either.)|`|2QvImMIxaa	aska doc|`|xwOwsZvEaa	i agree with coolmom it is to protect her
m9eSPvdfaa	No offense to you but your boyfriend sounds like a selfish, immature jerk. I wouldn't sacrifice my child because it's "dad" wasn't ready for him/her. He should have thought of that before having sex. Anyway, I could really rant about this all day but let me just say this..the decision is yours. Not his. Don't miss out on meeting someone amazing in every way because your boyfriend is a coward. I had my first child at 17. My second at 25 and Ive raised them on my own (dont even get child support because i dont want to follow visitation schedules.) because their "dads" really weren't worth my time when it came down to it. My kids are wonderful and I couldn't imagine life without them. Don't miss their dads at all. I am now married (for alittle over a yr) and just had my 3rd child 3mo ago. My husband is the best thing that ever happend to me, and my babies! So if you are pregnant and elect to have an abortion, think long and hard on it, do it for your reasons, NOT his. And I'd definately dump his *** and move on to someone that accepts the consequences of his actions and who is strong enough to be there for you when you need him. Hope you aren't offended and hope my opinion is helpful|`|bkNng3kCaa	You know in your heart what the right thing to do is.  That precious baby you are carrying didn't ask to be created.  Your boyfriend had a choice...before he had sex with you.  Now he doesn't want to live up to his responsibility.  <br>  <br>  You will have to face the fact that you aborted your baby for the rest of your life, that is a consequence you do not want to put on yourself.  You love your first little one, your love for your new baby will only multiply.  <br>  <br>  Do the right thing.  God will make a way.  He might even change your boyfriend's heart about being a dad.|`|fhaABrwiaa	well, ultimately it is your choice, not your bf's coz its your body. i am against abortion, so i would say "NO DONT DO IT" but to be helpful and supportive:<br>  <br>  if you feel it is what you need to do, do it<br>  if you are not sure, consult a doctor<br>  <br>  if you do, make sure you see a counselor afterwords|`|LQnKhiVMaa	if he told u to jump off a cliff would u?? if he doesnt want to be a dad, he doesnt have to be, that doesnt mean, u cant be a damn good mother single or otherwise, 2 2 beautiful children, my partner asked me to have an abortion, with my first child, i refused, and he soon realised what a mistake he had made, he is now an amazing father, and i am glad i forgave him, as is he... he loves us both very much and is now looking 4ward to becoming a daddy to 2 children x x so it might be that he just needs time to realise x|`|21c10ff4b98da8bd7f4718177f614888aa	it doesn't matter weather or not hes ready to be a dad, if he wasn't he would have wrapped it. but since he didn't and if you are pregnant, its your body. if you don't feel as if an abortion is the right thing, don't do it.  its your child as well.  look at how many couples cant get pregnant, and you're lucky enough to. don't take away from what someone else cant have. if you don't feel like you are ready for another one, adoption is the best answer.  hope you choose wisely.|`|1445874f3f5b71b7f8e98d2d0e1d329eaa	don't let him tell u what to do, its your right to have it, i was told to abort by my drs.  because i am diabetic, i told all of them to go to hell. i do not personally believe in abortion, but everyone has a right to there opinion.just tell him this.................... if u r  big enough to lay down and do it, then u better dam well be ready to accept the consequences.  nothing in life is easy or free. sometimes the right thing to do is the hardest, and u never know what lays in store for this baby, could be a great person someday.|`|G06h3Vqcaa	it is YOUR decision.  if he wants to be immature and irresponible then you deserve better.  providing you were honest with him about not being on birth control, doesn't he realise the outcome of intercourse with out protection?  maybe he needs a sex education class.  it takes two to tango.|`|AA10309738	Wow your boyfriend sounds like a bastard.

It wasn't her choice, she was pushed into it and she felt the loss like a hole, basically like she had killed her baby. She is haunted by what-might-have-beens. You know yourself better than anyone. You know if you would regret this choice or not. Since you feel strongly against abortions, it is likely you would. Take your boyfriend out of the equation for a minute. What do YOU want and feel? If it comes down to it, adoption is always an option.|`|CB15kchkaa	You do not have to do anything you don't want to do, and if you are against abortion you should not compromise your own reality. <br>  Simply, if he is not ready to be a father, then you should not be ready to sleep with him without protection. He has spelled out his view, you need to spell out yours.|`|5XyBxxYAaa	Im sorry your b/f feels like that.  You are the only one who can make that choice and its a very big decision to make.

If you want to keep your baby then he should support you. Im sure he loves and cares about you a lot, maybe you just have to sit down and have a proper talk with him - ask him why he doesn't feel ready and such; get his views. In a couple of months he'll prob have changed his attitude - he's prob just young and scared, maybe afraid of the thought of this huge responsibility - but i mean talk to him - you've been together over half a year, he should understand.|`|hieQHR0daa	It really isn't his decision. I have met women who, for medical reasons, have chosen to have abortions, and other women who have made this choice for other reasons. It is never an easy choice and I have yet to meet someone who has made this difficult decision and never given it any more thought.<br>  You do what is right for you at the time, with all the information and support that's available. No one else can or should make that choice for you. You've not had a relationship with this person for long and if they drift out of your life you will still have to live with the decision you make. He can disappear from your life and not give it a second thought.<br>  It's simply not up to him.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	well he should have thought of that earlier. he can;t make you do anything and if he trys then he is so not worth it.  tell him that your against abortion. i had only been with my bf for 7 months when i found out i was pregnant with our first.  he wasn't ready to be a dad, he needed to finish school (we were suppose to be in grade 12 and he was still in grade 10 classes so i seriously doutb he would have finished without this extra push) he was a jerk but he adjusted eventually. maybe tell him when you find out if you are or not that your keeping it. then he can except it or get lost and pay up in 9 months. honestly if he trys to MAKE you he is so not worth your time.. and you really wouldn;t want your kids to see someone be controlling like that.|`|AA10040852	He seriously needs to read the bible on this, it is your choice, not his. adoption is the answer, not abortion.

hlWdFTcjaa	It could be possible you had a false negative, try and wait about 3 or 4 days to test again. It may be that if you are your HCG levels aren't high enough for a HPT to detect.

s2F6pK9Xaa	I've been taking them since April of last year...we finally decided on when to actually begin trying for baby # 1...about 4 months from now...but I wanted to be "baby ready" in case is was sooner of in case it "just happened".|`|xpstigPTaa	They say to start taking them 3 months prior to trying to conceive but as long as you start taking them as soon as yu are TTC you should be fine!! Best of luck!|`|90zcKChJaa	With our first baby I started taking prenatals 3 months ahead of trying to conceive. With this baby I just never quit taking them from my first pregnancy.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	ASAP.  If you're trying to conceive, then start taking them now.  If you're pregnant already, you should have started as soon as you found out.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Before you even get pregnant. I started taking prenatal vitamins when I was trying to conceive.|`|ZErpLwQUaa	as soon as you find out that you are pregnant. If you are trying to conceive, then you should speak to your Doc|`|lCxcfisfaa	I just found out I am 3 weeks and the Dr. gave them to me before my blood test even came back positive.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	They are fine to take even when you are not pregnant so I started taking them as soon as we were thinking about getting pregnant. Some things like folic acid is needed in the early early stages to prevent spinal cord deformations which is the first thing that your baby develops so it is needed as soon as you become pregnant. Folic acid does not store itself in your body so you need a daily supply. Start taking it now better safe than sorry|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I think that you should start taking them before you start trying to have a baby even.  The sooner you start taking them the better.  Otherwise, I'd say it's best to at least start taking them as soon as you find out that you're pregnant.|`|6fbbef3a86754c97a2ee57742fbd01acaa	From the time you start trying to conceive until the baby is born.. hopefully the two fall close together for you|`|d96SSlrIaa	As soon as you can get them.
AA12145826	Personally, I'm for portable DVD players you attach to the headrest but that can be used outside of the vehicle as well. We have had 2 portable DVD players that have been incredibly reliable and both were purchased at Wal-Mart. The first was a Cody model w/ a 7" screen (cost: approx. $80 on sale). This player went everywhere with us; car trips, airplane rides, etc. It came in handy while waiting in the airport, gave us entertainment & a place to play our Disney Scene It! game during a rain-soaked family camping trip, even allowed me to watch a movie while she was watching a cartoon at the hotel. It was stolen last summer which is why we purchase our second one, a tablet style model who brand name is completely escaping my mind, anyways it was $150 but comes with a battery that holds a charge for several hours (we've played 2.5 fairly long (90-120 minutes each) movies before it said to charge it).<br>  <br>  My only advice with the portable models is to get one that either allows the screen to be swiveled & folded flat against the player while viewing or a tablet-style model. It will hold nicely against the back of the headrest and won't take up too much room.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	The flip down ones are the best they work better and can be flipped up for storage. Good luck!!|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I love having our DVD player on long trips. My 3 year old loves it and we live 6 hours from both families so it keeps my husband and myself sane. We have a flip down monitor and honestly in our next vehicle we are having the headrest monitors put in because the flip down monitor blocks the rear view mirror which doesn't bother me but it aggravates my husband to death since he drives with all his mirrors. We only paid 500 for our flip down and 100 for installation which is a lot cheaper than we were quoted for the head rest installation. I think I will pay the extra 250 though to stop the complaining of my husband. I guess it depends on where you go for price though.
3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	I have not read that book so I cannot give an accurate recommendation.  However, I have read What to Expect When You're Expecting and What to Expect in the First Year.  They are both wonderful books and I totally recommend them.<br>  <br>  I had heartburn my entire pregnancy.  It's normal.  Talk to your doctor, but tums or calcium supplements should be ok to help ease it.<br>  <br>  As long as there is no odor to the discharge you are fine with it.  The amount is normal.<br>  <br>  Morning sickness comes in all types of packages, I vomited once every morning by 9am.  Other people just feel ill all day, some have vomiting only at night.  It's perfectly fine that you're not vomiting.  In fact I wish I was that way.  :)<br>  <br>  The dreams/nightmares are completely normal.  I had a reoccuring dream throughout my pregnancy that my baby would come out with a normal body but with a grown man's head and facial features.  My daughter is beautiful and came out looking normal.  Because of your past, these fears are completely normal.  One of my best friends lost her 5 day old son to SIDS when she was 14 and when she had her daughter at 20, had a lot of fears.  She was very overprotective of her daughter until she turned about 2.  You will bond with your baby regardless of the sex.  It will be hard, I'm sure to not think of your brother all the time.  My suggestion would be to talk to a councelor or therapist (if you're ok with that) to help you embrace and accept your brother's passing (you can never truly get over it) so that you can be the best mommy your baby could ever ask for.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	ok first i really don't think that what to expect eating book is necessary, all pregnancy books go over what you should and shouldn't be eating. just eat healthy<br>  <br>  as for the heartburn i have had it from the day i got pregnant and it could get worst at the end, so yes you probably have it. try drinking more milk and less fry-ed foods, no spicy eather and keep tums at hand. if it gets real bad tell your Doctor and they will put you one something. <br>  <br>  the discharge is also normal and there will be more as time passes. i where panty liners every day.<br>  <br>  i started getting sick (vomiting) around 7 weeks however everyone is different and some people never vomit. so just relax have some ginger ale and crackers and hang in there, it will pass.<br>  <br>  the biggest question is maybe you may want to go talk to someone about your obsession.. i wouldn't worry so much about your pregnancy, just take of your self, go to the doctor have your test done and everything should be ok.<br>  but if you have a serious obsession i would go to a counselor or something like that to talk about it and you may feel better about it! <br>  <br>  good luck|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Everything you have is normal.  You have to remember that these books are based on an average, and they are not necessarily true for every woman because every pregnancy is different.  I wouldn't doubt it if you had heartburn.  Clear or white discharge is normal!  I'm 22 weeks and it varies from day to day on how much I have and what it looks like.  Just don't worry about it unless you have some that is dark yellow in color or tinged with blood.  Then I would call the doctor and let them know.  But, spotting is also normal during pregnancy, especially if you've just had sex, so don't let the blood freak you out.  I would just call to be on the safe side.  Nausea is common and some women never even experience a wave of it.  Then others throw up all day long and throughout all 9 months.<br>  <br>  It is normal to feel worried and anxious about your baby, especially if this is your first pregnancy.  Things will ease up and your fear will be replaced with excitement the more you go through.  Seeing the baby on the ultrasound, hearing the heartbeat, feeling those kicks.  You are already bonding with the baby, you just may not know it yet.  Congratulations and I hope everything goes well for you!|`|lLyyuPpvaa	I have not read the eating book, but to be honest, you are going to eat what you feel like eating.<br>  <br>  Heartburn for me appeared on day one, I could not stop burping, and actually that is what led to me getting the pregnancy test, a co-worker told me that is what happened to her when she was first pregnant. So don't worry, about the heartburn, take some Tums, it is good for your calcium any way :)<br>  <br>  Discharge is going to run the gambit, clear, yellow, white, mucus like, stringy, goo-ey, chunky....only get concerned if the doctor gets concerned or they find protein in your urine, or if you itch really bad down there like a yeast infection, because those are WAY common during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Now, for the nightmares..they will get worse, I'm sorry to say. I am an only child, with no deaths in my family, and I was convinced until about month 6 that any day I was going to mis-carry, that has now been replaced by SIDS dreams, and ideas. The best advice I can give you is to take it in steps. Personally I have told all relatives and people that I know not to get anything until I was 6 months along, it felt like I was putting a jinx on the baby if I got a bunch of stuff too soon. An now that I am on month 7 I have told everyone to get gift receipts for all big things like the crib and what not, that way if something does happen to the baby I can return it and get them their money back. I don't know why I have this morbid outlook, at least you partially have a reason, but you can't let it stop your pregnancy. I have found that now that I can feel the baby kicking, and have named her, that it is becoming easier thinking about her in my life, and I am not as scared now. I think feeling her helped a long way. I have the opposite problem of you though, I am not a girly girl at all, in fact I look and act stereo-typical lesbian...and I am going to have a girl?!?!?!?!? What if she wants her hair curled, or to wear makeup, or wants dresses? I don't do any of that!<br>  <br>  I guess what I am saying is that what will come, will come, and you can either stress about the unknown, or try to enjoy it. We all have these worries, some of us more than others, but it's just part of the pregnancy roller coaster. Good luck!|`|WbaSpiYpaa	I understand your fears.  I had a miscarriage last March, and I'm now 6 months pregnant.  I also have dreams about something happening to this baby, and I'm a nervous wreck.  <br>  <br>  As for what to eat when you're expecting, I wouldn't read it.  Women have been having babies for years and years without these books, and have done fine.  As long as you're not drinking alcohol, cut back on caffeine, not smoking, or doing drugs you'll be fine.  As for the heartburn, I've had it since the beginning.  I only vomited during one weekend, the rest of the time I just felt really nauseous.  As for the discharge everyone is different.<br>  <br>  I think right now you're mind is on overload.  You will bond with your baby whether a boy or girl.  I know  you are scarred over memories of your baby brother, but this is a different child and you will love him/her.  As long as your not bleeding, I wouldn't worry.  Good Luck!|`|4QEjQrHcaa	okay first what to expect i  followed every email through my pregnancy it nevergave me a reason to doubt it..but what to expect is not the only pregnancy health information you can get ask your dr or even look it up for yourself everyone will give you different answers just follow what you feel is right..<br>  <br>  white and clear discharge is completely normal its dark discharge or bright red bleeding you need to be concerned about<br>  <br>  and nausea without vomiting is completly normal..i was so sick the first 4 months spent most of it in a hospital bed.. be lucky your not throwing up dehydration is dangerous for you and baby<br>  <br>  <br>  and you biggest question. it is completly normal to feel the way you do with your brothers death and being afraid to lose your baby to i was terrified my whole pregnancy and also had some really screwed up dreams that is normal..i even found myself making excuses to go to the emergency room just to hear a heart beat...if you get nervous give your dr a call tell her/him you are worried and just need some re-assurance im sure they will be more then willing to accomidate..<br>  <br>  everything your feeling is normal..im sure your child will be beautiful and healthy. just hold strong and remember right now your body is going through things it cant fully understand..its trying to cope the same as you are...you'll get the hang of it..good luck|`|1tmX7xbRaa	first reading all those books is good but don't look into them too much. you have to follow your instincts. they are 99% right.<br>  you can have heartburn at anytime. with my first daughter it was more at the 6-8 months but with my second (due in may) the heartburn started around 4-5 months. yes it does get worse at night but i don't know why.<br>  the discharge thing is the same for me. sometimes it's clear, sometimes it's whitish and some days it's heavy some days it's barely there.<br>  sick but not vomiting is ok. with my first daughter i was horribly sick the whole time (throwing up and all) with my second i have felt real sick but rarely throw up. you don't' have to vomit.<br>  the nightmares are normal during pregnancy. most women end up having VERY vivid and even terrifying dreams when pregnant... i know i have. since the death of your brother is on your mind it's only natural that you would be dreaming about your baby in the same way. dreams can amplify your fears. don't let them get to you.<br>  don't be worried about your bond with baby if it's a boy. you will have a strong bond with your baby no matter what.|`|ufKahy4Oaa	no I don't reccoment that book. I do reccomend "great expectations" and "the birth partner"<br>  <br>  you can get heartburn at any point, ussually it is worse toward the end, but you can have it anythime.<br>  <br>  your discharge sounds normal, if it smells bad, talk to your doctor about it<br>  <br>  you can feel pretty nauseated without actually vomiting, it ussually ends around 13-14 weeks, but can last throughout your entire pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I never lost a sibling, or a baby, but I didn't bond with my second baby during my pregnancy, and I was worried I wouldn't bond with her well, or maybe I'd have post partum depression, but the second she came out i was in love with her.<br>  with my first pregnancy I had recurring nightmares that she was kidnapped, I think it is normal to have these fears. <br>  It is also VERY normal to worry about loseing the pregnancy and to worry about your baby dieing in the first months after birth. I still worry about something happeing to my almost 4 yo.<br>  <br>  to answer all your questions.... you sound normal in every question.
TdIbrGYYaa	I would say you have an infection of some kind directly related to the C-Section.  I would get in and see the Dr.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	You are very observant.  Actually, the majority of bad breath comes from the tongue, not the teeth.  The white stuff you see on your tongue is the bacteria.  This white stuff must be removed if you are going to get rid of bad breath.  I use an OraBrush tongue cleaner because it is both a brush and a scraper.  I clean my tongue every time I brush my teeth and I can go up to 12 hours without any bad breath.  Here is the website if you are interested:<br>  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com/halitosis.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com/halitosis.php</a>|`|AA12395149	I've never heard of a c-section affecting breath and tongue color.  You may have a flu or mild infection.  If you've changed what you're eating, that can effect your mouth as well.  You may need to see your doctor or a dentist if it persists.
zqfs7A6Caa	You can read to them at the same time. Let your son sit beside you and the 13-month-old can relax in her swing.<br>  <br>  At other times, you can encourage your son to sing or play peek-a-boo with your daughter. You can also make a game out of having your son help with the baby so he learns to be a caring brother while your daughter bonds with him.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	paint ..put daughter in a high chair and the son at the table|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Play with a ball eg. the older child can help to teach the younger one to hold the ball, then catch it, then run with the ball, kick etc.<br>  <br>  Gentle rumbles and cuddles on the carpet together.<br>  <br>  Reading a book together with good pictures, colours and words etc. that both will get something from.<br>  <br>  Hide and seek, even if you and your son have to help your daughter for a while, she might enjoy the surprise of finding and being found.<br>  <br>  Blowing bubbles - you and your son can blow them and your daughter can catch and watch.<br>  <br>  Dancing to catchy music or a kids CD or video.<br>  <br>  Maybe some of these might be okay.  Good luck.
1ezYfkX7aa	My 7year old son son has done this sinse he was a year old and still to this day does it. lol, i think its very cute and its just something that has grown on me from him....out of my other 2 kids he is the only one that has done this and its something that when he is older i will always remember =) Nothing to worry about i think its normal, they are just super excited at times lol|`|rTtIKOmpaa	This is usually a symptom of autism. You are exactly describing my niece who has autism. Does she have other signs? If so look into it.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	everyone has different ways of showing their excitement. I don't see anything out of the ordinary with what she is doing. It has probably become a habit for her to do it when she is very happy. If you're concerned bring it up at her next well child check up or give your doctor a call. If your worried it never hurts to take things a little further...for your sanity.|`|El65sns4aa	Sounds "normally abnormal"! LOL! maybe she seen a cartoon, animal,movie, etc that did something similar and she is mocking it. OR people just do their own things. Abnormal is in. Not everyone has to take their two hands and clap them for excitement. I just may use her technique. :) At least someone is trying something different! lol Ask her why she does it and see what she says. She may look at you and wonder why you don't! LMAO!|`|f1nX6thdaa	Your child is fine!! He is not autistic!!! lol!  All three of my daughters have their quirks!! my nine year old pretends to faint when she gets excited and has done this for a few years!! It drives me crazy!! lol
v6DRUwH7aa	Allison Isabella is perfect!|`|NWEJdpocaa	Alison Journey is cute if you really like Journey. Since it is so unique I would keep it as a middle name and the name Alison really evens it out!|`|DZJsQFGAaa	I like Alison Olivia.<br>  Journey is a really nice middle name!!!!!!!!|`|8uvb3Nroaa	I like Alison Paige. Journey is too weird for me. think about your child as a middle aged person named Journey, or when she's applying for jobs. Not good.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I like Alison Paige best, but if you REALLY like Journey, I would pick Alison Journey...and you could call her AJ for short!|`|VPOaunmvaa	Olivia Danielle is beautiful i also really love Olivia Paige <br>  <br>  :)|`|ln0wLqZhaa	Alison paige And Journey Isabella|`|EiN9qdapaa	Journey Isabella is my #1 <br>  Alison Journey is my #2 <br>  Alison Paige is my #3 <br>  Olivia Daniele in my #4|`|0iYoPLGIaa	Journey Isabella!!!!|`|ElayGlHPaa	Journey Isabella|`|i3GmRK2Qaa	Alison Isabella|`|HDS3IGj1aa	alison paige|`|6nWzhWyaaa	Journey Isabella for sure!<br>  <br>  I even thought that before you said you liked the name journey|`|xCeaVqItaa	Journey Isabella is so cute. I love that name! Good choice (:
oHmVGBCEaa	i went to my 1st antenatal alone it's no big deal. Your midwife will probably do wee sample blood pressure do your height and weight and give you your notes which you will keep for the next 9 months|`|OPTDFRuzaa	it wont matter your on your own as its just to ask you about previous pregnancies and any miscarraiges. the midwife will give you a rough due date but it will probably change once you have your dating scan at 12-13 weeks.. she will ask about heriditery family illnesses that are genetic such as downs syndrome or heart problems and you need to ask your boyfriend if there are any illnesses in his side of the family and you need to pass this info on to your midwife, good luck and congrats!|`|dce76f8c953c3862bd6ec4c53b88a814aa	Just a general check on your health, Blood pressure, weight ect.<br>  and to answer any questions you have.|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	Going alone is perfectly fine. Don't worry about it. She will probably want some information from you (date of your last period, how you are feeling, etc) and may wish to do an pelvic exam to make sure your cervix looks alright. She will probably also measure your belly. She'll weigh you and take a urine sample.<br>  <br>  At the hospital, they take blood samples, too, but  I don't think midwives can do that.|`|0xTBYmdGaa	no it doesnt matter that ur going on ur own. she will prob do ur blood pressure ask u questions bout family ilnesses, give u ur pregnancy notes if u havent got them already, arrange a scan date and also mite want a urine sample, good luck|`|wEwNDYPkaa	Well, yes it matters it means he isn't supportive enough x It will just we for a check up. Don't worry, everything will be okay x
b8f0CfSsaa	As you said our bodies don't work like clockwork. I am in the same position, and I have read on a few feeds on here that some women haven't found out until 5 weeks gestational!<br>  <br>  A home pregnancy test apparently detects 3 days past implantation-the kidneys take this long on average to filter the hormone. However a lot of doctors will advise that waiting until 1 week past your missed period is the best time to test as your HCG would almost certainly be high enough by then. <br>  <br>  Good luck with TTC.|`|RPszYGXkaa	Usually you can get a positive within 4 days of implantation, just use a sensitive test.|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	It's diff for every woman but I had a spot of pink the day before I tested pos with my son and it was 13dpo. 6-10 is just the average time implantation occurs is MOST women but it can occur anywhere from 3-14 days actually. Some women can be pregnant and come up with false neg for a few weeks before they get a BFP. Don't lose hope! but don't be dissapointed either. There's always next month! When I got pregnant with my son I was convinced I was not. (and statistics show that a lot of women find out they are pregnant during the month that they are convinced they're not)|`|YLXpwqceaa	A HPT will detect pregnancy into the second month of gestation.  My doctor said that the hormone starts declining around the 10th week of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  You are good for awhile still.<br>  <br>  You're totally right, not everyone works like clockwork!  Not everyone has a 14 day luteal phase or what not.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you hun!|`|iES3MIPcaa	hey, usually after 2 days, as your hcg hormone doubles every 2-3 days, so i'd leave it a couple of days then retest.<br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope it's positive for you!! x|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well first off implantation happens between days 6 and 10.  Day 13 would be too late since the leuteal phase is 14 days long at max.  Sorry but negative means negative.
r7q8LW7Aaa	Wow, all your previous questions are similar - asking about the possibility of pregnancy.<br>  Why don't you just take a damn test instead of asking strangers?|`|uuHPneEcaa	Not really, u could miss ur period due to stress.. I didn't experiance any chest pains. but then again all women are different. U should call ur doctor it could be something else more serious. U could take a pregnancy test first. But I would call a doctor asap for the chest pains|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Chest pains aren't pregnancy symptoms...and your stomach wouldn't be tight this early on unless you mean you're bloated.  Bloat happens for most pregnant women.  If you're having a late period I'd take a test.  For the chest pains I'd contact your family doctor.|`|k6x2lVLYaa	we need more details first of all.<br>  <br>  Second of all, did you have intercourse?<br>  And how old are you?<br>  Also, your menstrual cycle can change due to changes in your life or emotional changes.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, most likely not. And during pms, i had chest pain because of the weight from my boobs pushing down on me, and my stomach felt tight.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	it could mean your pregnant. but sometimes if your stressed it can cause your period to be late. try take a home pregnancy test to find out. good luck :)|`|FL2nfCSXaa	allen? isnt that a guys name? you are stupid.|`|NLwwRtwwaa	If you have had unprotected sex recently than yes their is a possibility. When I missed my period just one day, I found out I was pregnant. Just take a pregnancy from CVS or walgreens or something just so you won't worry yourself.
D0oqTblpaa	I think that thanks to her cruelty to you and your mom she lost out.  Not mourning her is in this case natural as there was no love lost between you.  Don't feel so guilty.  In the end she's the one that lost out.  <br>  <br>  Just as long as you are supportive or your father who is grieving then I wouldn't say you are a bad person.|`|mgTZD9Teaa	Well, my paternal Grandmother died long before I was born.  But my maternal Grandmother died on my 15th birthday.  Let's just say I couldn't bring myself to celebrate. <br>  <br>  Obviously we're in different circumstances, I would be a little sad in your case.  But I wouldn't be devastated, I know this sounds bad, but at least she's out of your life now.|`|HOdblqIkaa	i can see why you might not be upset you werent close to her so even though you know it affects your family it may not affect you to the same extent. its normal, i mean my uncle was the "black sheep" of the family, he abused drugs and his family and then tried to live off of relatives and the state. when he died my mom-he was her older brother-was sad but she didnt fly out to go to his funeral or send a card to his ex wife. he just died and that was pretty much it. we werent close so it didnt bother me.|`|6lSbmXunaa	Yeah, I would be sad if my nana died. I mean, she's really close to me and my family- she calls everyday and loves us to pieces, so I would be devastated. But, just because someone is in your family doesn't mean you HAVE to be sad when they pass on. To be honest, I wouldn't be very upset in your situation either.  You can't force yourself to feel sad, so don't feel bad.  You're not being cruel at all.|`|oQDQSSSDaa	Thinking about it, I'm pretty much sad of what today is. (Over here). Today's my Grandma's Birthday and I miss her much like all of my other grandparents. ): I had a thought about that yesterday.<br>  <br>  24th Feb today. :) Now anyway.|`|AfvLIt8laa	both my grandma's died before i was 5 years old....so idk, but i would assume i was sad. i guess i see it as even if my grandma would of been like yours, i still would of been happy to have one in my life.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I would be very upset if my grandma died. Even though this may sound mean, I can understand. When someone is cruel towards you, you can't develop feelings for them.<br>  Sorry for her loss, though.|`|MuALb7lxaa	Duh. My grandma does everything for me, way more than my parents do.|`|4vdINuv6aa	Personally, I would miss my grandma if she passed away. I love my grandma to death.<br>  <br>  But, see if my aunt or dad passed away, I would not be sad at all. My aunt and dad have always been hateful and have always had attitudes towards me. When I was 2, my dad did some stuff to me and thats another huge reason I would not miss him or be upset if he died.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	No i dont find that weird.<br>  I dont have the best relationship with my gran yet i would be sad if she passed, not as sad as when my grandad past away a few years back!!|`|C0uMGfCCaa	yes and no. if she was mean yo wouldn't really be upset but still she was family.|`|mViaFhVVaa	it all depends on the situation between them two<br>  x|`|giZNTxWQaa	ok, if you not feeling sad , dont force it|`|iJbslaQNaa	not so|`|loBIruvbaa	of course i would be sad if my grandmother died...|`|E7ViD8EWaa	My nonna died when I was 9 =[ <br>  I was crying for weeks, she was my favourite person in the whole wide world. She was the only person who really truly cared about me.<br>  <br>  I was even sadder that we couldn't be at the funeral in Italy, because my parents were fighting so much that they refused to be in the same place, even though I was begging to go (they're divorced, and both have very busy schedules).<br>  <br>  I still cry a ton. I miss her a lot.<br>  *Cries*<br>  <br>  If you weren't close/she was mean to you, I don't think it's a big deal that you weren't sad.|`|nKSmgjylaa	Of course! I live with my Nan and I love her to death. She's been a better mom to be than my actual mother has.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Umm...I would be upset...my own father died five months ago and I'm still devastated.<br>  <br>  But...yeah, your grandmother sounded really horrible. I wouldn't miss her.<br>  <br>  To make you feel better, my late father's wife the most awful person I've ever come across...she was VERY abusive to my father, brothers, sister, and I...she was also a rotten friend and hated my family; she even hates her own family and herself. Well...I moved out because I had enough of her, and...I don't miss her one little bit.<br>  <br>  It's all good! :)|`|hstwNjNaaa	I'd be sad if my Grandmother died, but if you had a bad relationship with her then it doesn't make it harsh of you not to be really sad. Just because she's your family doesn't mean you have to get on, and some people are cruel.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	I can't blame you. I would me a lot more upset and depressed if my mom's mother died because I'm closer to her. If you don't miss her, you just don't. There's nothing wrong with that. Plus, she was abusive.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	if he was cruel and there was no attachment I would not find that weird... sorry you had to go through that!<br>  <br>  My grandma died when I was 7 and I loved her a lot and barely saw her...she was supposed to come for a visit but then she died. I was sad, but didn't fully grasp it all at such a young age except for uderstanding she'd not be there in the summer when we went to Cape Cod and that she went to heaven. My mom buried her with a picture I drew for her. <br>  <br>  My nana is still alive but when she does pass I will be heartbroken as well... she's amazing and the only grandma I really knew well since my other one died when I was so young.
NaJPIOheaa	hey hun, i have to say congrats now! because they say evap lines only appear after then 10 minutes, but in my own experience it takes a few hours! i would get another test and, of course, test in the morning! GOOD LUCK! xo|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Evap lines show up after the test reading time. They also don't have any color to them. FRE tests are reliable.<br>  <br>  Congrats Momma :)<br>  <br>  Compare yours to the links below!|`|TljXiSNnaa	OMG im sooo happy for you!!! i love it when we get the BFP!!!! i got first response and mine came up right when i put it down!!! congrats girle have a fun and safe pregnancy!!! if you have any questions just email me i have some answers !!!|`|eytlIKITaa	If it came up right away it's a positive!!!|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I literally took 2 tests(both first response) and got a faint second line. My neighbor said yep your pregnant. I of course couldn't take it and went and got a digital test (you know the one that say pregnant/not pregnant). Of course it came up pregnant and I am completly thrilled. I am now 14 weeks pregnant. Good luck and if you think you are crazy like I thought I was go get a digital. It is always better to know than to worry that you might be wrong.|`|8mchLCQhaa	It is a BFP. It would only be an evaporation line after the test became invalid. I would buy a digital one and test again in the morning. It says pregnant or not pregnant so it is not easily confused. I think you are pregnant congrats|`|fWAzJIEkaa	Wohooo!!! Im excited!!!<br>  How long was it til the 2nd line came up?<br>  If I where u, either get a digital, and do it first thing in the morning.. or re do the same test tomorrow morning =)<br>  <br>  Let me know how it goes..Fingers crossed for u sweetie! xx|`|eP729T0Qaa	You're pregnant!!!! Congratulations! If there is even a faint line for the pregnant line then it's a positive!|`|34YAS4a0aa	aine is a line!!! take another test first thing in the morning! good luck|`|yp9rEMSraa	Its a BFP!!!  Congrates...test in the morning if you are worried about it with the first morning pee but it looks promising to me!!! Im so happy for you!! Best of luck|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It is a positive...evaps show up like 10 minutes later...congrats.|`|f066bc63dc201d9ff49cf81de2f92a07aa	I hope its a BFP!  xx|`|fpZ014Uraa	i used a dollar general test and got a false positive but then retested and got a neg so dont just count on one test use several and then confirm with blood test <br>  good luck and congrats|`|wom2ER4Baa	its positive anyway recheck it up...congratulaution|`|RPszYGXkaa	Well evaps can come up before the time limit (happened to me :-()<br>  But, is there color in the line?  Is the line the same thickness as the control line?  Generally an evap has no color (looks like a grey color), and is usually thinner than the control line.  If it is the same color dye as the control line and the same thickness it is probably a BFP.<br>  <br>  Can you post a pic??|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	That would be a BFP, Jess!!!!  Congratulations dear!!!!
urarletqaa	I had a membrane sweep at 41 weeks and I wish I hadn't. It's very uncomfortable and I went in to labour the same evening. i had a complicated labour and birth and I don't know if its because I rushed my baby because of the sweep. You've still got time to wait, give it a few more days or a week. Its better that the baby comes out when it wants to. Good luck in whatever you choose to do.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i have been told its very uncomfortable and if it fails they give you gel in your vagina then if 2 lots of gels fail you will be admitted and be given the drip in your hand.|`|ded4210b2d8375997cd6719be107446baa	i had one with my last and it was like a strong period pain, I took paracetamol afterwards. It can be effective but then again it does not always work, however having the sweep and then sex and orgasm will defo contribute towards it all!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	The sweep ! eww I hated that. Its is painful but it helps the progress along. It helped me dialate from 1 to 2 in 3days. You may bleed alot after but its worth it!|`|GjuRYsITaa	it doesn't hurt might be a bit uncomfortable<br>  my midwife gave me one with baby #3 and broke my waters by accident while doing it, baby was born 3 hours later|`|jjQOvFyzaa	doesnt hurt jst uncomfortable..jst like an internal exam comparable to a pap smear|`|48OzgToGaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I had a sweep last Thursday at 40 weeks + 1 day, it wasn't painful, just a little bit uncomfortable really but was worth a try!!  I had slight cramps later that day and a tiny amount of spotting then nothing.  For some they go into labour within 48 hours so if your body is ready this could help start labour for you, Best of Luck!!<br>  <br>  I'm now 40+5 and at the hospital tomorrow where I think they'll do another sweep, fingers crossed all goes well this time|`|lv6gkEVaaa	Hi i had my wee baby 4 weeks ago i Went in for a sweep at 38 weeks pregnant,It wasn't sore only a bit uncomfortable,I had it done at 9 30 in the Morning and started felling pressure done below straight away but it wasn't sore,later on i started getting braxton hicks about 7o'clock and every time i had one the pressure got stronger i lasted to 11o'clock and then i started getting pain i went to the hospital and at 23 minutes past7 my wee son was born,so i wish you all the best, i was the same as you i asked the same question.|`|cnIzqEoDaa	I had a membrane sweep at the end of my last pregnancy. It is a little painful and makes you spot afterwards. It may or may not get things going (as far as labor). It helped me go from not dilated to dilated half a cm. It's different for everyone though. Good luck!|`|da498dbd39048a1057d2c4954514a889aa	HURTS HURTS HURTS. But it is worth it, I had this done with my son and was in labor that night. Hopefully my OB will do this to me today as well.

If she wants to move she will need your permission, through court papers, IF she doesn't get it, she'll find herself in a heep of rouble.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I don't the answer to your questions but this is a crappy situation to be in. I really think child support screws a lot of dads. Some end up paying so much to one women for a child and stuggle daily to support theirselves and their other children. A lot of women fight for every penny they can get even if they don't need it. It's ridiculous.<br>  <br>  *Thought I would add, maybe you should fight for custody of the child if your situation allows. At least the child would be taken care of and you wouldn't have to pay that women to sit on her a**.|`|AA11537580	file for custody of your daughter|`|AA10206910	I agree with the first answer. Get your butt into court and ASAP. At the very least, find out if Social Services is coming to the house.

Stand up for your rights and don't let the mother drag you down.|`|AA10796679	why should your x have to work? it is your child isn't it? if your not man enough to take care of your children then perhaps you shouldn't be spreading your seed around. i took care of all my children and my wife never had to work. so did many many other men  thats MEN not crybaby boys|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Take her to court and tell the leach it is time to go get a job.  She is ridiculous and is going to have a rude awakening when the child is 18.  You should also tell the court that you do not think the money is being spent on the child(ren) and that you want to set up a trustee.  This ensures that every penny is spent for the kids and hopefully this will encourage her to make her own money.  It seems mean, but you are not supposed to be supporting her and her habits- only the kids!

We turned out normal healthy kids. Yours will too, if you let them. Don't drive them to paranoia. There's enough of that already.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Since your mom only lives a couple houses away from you, suggest her watching the baby at YOUR house, where there won't be a smoke smell, and if she wants to have a cigarette while the baby is sleeping or entertaining itself, then she can step outside to smoke.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Well... can she watch the baby at YOUR house?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't put my baby in that environment at all.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Suck it up and pay for daycare or wait until you can stay home and take care of the child yourself.|`|AA10096832	I'm going to echo what pretty much everyone else has said re: keeping baby away from smoking grandma. Also, Folk Goddess made a great point about just talking to your mom. I mean, your mom cannot have been living under a rock for the last 20 years. She has to know about the horrible effects of smoking and second-hand smoke.<br>  <br>  Also, maybe it's time to think outside the box. Is there anyway you could cut expenses or rearrange your work schedules so your child wouldn't have to be in daycare much? I know a couple who both work 4 days a week. Their kids are only in daycare Tues, Wed, Thurs. Mom works M-Th, Dad works Tues-Fri. Could you or your partner cut down on your hours for the first year? Around here, mediocre daycare for infants starts at $1000 per month. Good daycare is more like $1200-$1600 per month. So daycare can be pretty spendy.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Why can't your mom watch your baby at your house?  And of course not smoke inside.<br>  <br>  But yes letting baby stay in a room where someone smokes at all (even if they don't smoke when baby is there) is a big SIDS risk.<br>  <br>  Also, on a personal note, my mom and step-dad weren't even terribly heavy smokes (combined about 2 packs per day) and they worked full time and did a fair bit of their smoking at work.  I was diagnosed with asthma as a teen, had the inhaler and the whole bit.  I even ended up in the ER once.  Within two years of moving out I no longer needed an inhaler -turns out it wasn't asthma at all, it was chronic allergic response.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.costkids.org/tobacco/ets/into..." rel="nofollow">http://www.costkids.org/tobacco/ets/into...</a><br>  The risk of SIDS (crib death) doubles for each hour a day a baby spends in a room where people smoke.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ash.org/kids/sids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ash.org/kids/sids.html</a><br>  Children of smokers who spent eight hours a day in a room where someone sometimes smoked were eight times more likely to die<br>  <br>  ''The risk increases crudely by 100 percent for every hour a day a baby spends in a smoky atmosphere.

They suggested that their results lend weight to earlier reports that children with<br>  <br>  outdoor-smoking parents tend to have a higher prevalence of ear infections and respiratory symptoms than children of nonsmokers but less than children of indoor smokers.<br>  <br>  They suggested that parents should be advised that<br>  <br>  smoking outdoors with the door closed is a meaningful way of ETS protection, whereas other precautions indoors have little or no effect. Whether outdoor smoking is as good as nonsmoking remains to be shown.<br>  <br>  Also publishing in 2004, Prof. Matt of San Diego University and his colleagues reported on a study that found that tobacco by-products were trapped in household dust, carpets, ceiling tiles, soft furnishings etc. and therefore increased children's exposure. These smoking by-products can have a legacy for several months after smoking occurred. Matt and his team used nicotine monitors in the child's bedroom and the main living room. They analysed dust, surfaces, the child's hair and urine for the chemical compounds associated with tobacco smoke.<br>  <br>  A column of cigarette smoke passes from one open mouth to another: written under the smoke are the words 'Die with me'Even in homes where the parents smoke outside, the levels of tobacco contaminants were up to 7x greater than in homes where neither parent smokes.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You will have to be blunt, I think. (And your bluntness will NOT shock them and tell them anything they don't already know.)<br>  <br>  "Second hand smoke, even on your clothes, is known to be harmful for babies and children. That's not a risk I'm willing to take. Yes, I know we 'turned out fine', but I don't want to take a chance."<br>  <br>  Maybe, if you're lucky, this will encourage them to take the plunge and quit smoking. (Benefiting their own health AND allowing you to take advantage of their offer to provide child care.)  If not .... they don't watch the baby, and you find the money for daycare somewhere in the budget.|`|AA11784984	I don't know what to do about the smell except asking her to quit but you could always have her watch the baby at your house (smoke free) and if she really needs a cigg to go outside quickly. Like I said she will still smell of it but it wont be around the baby.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I would rather pay someone to come watch my daughter in my home than send her to grandmas who smokes and heavily at that.  You dont necessarily need to go with day care, try a nanny or sitter they are cheaper.

You absolutely should NOT expose your baby or child to that kind of toxic atmosphere.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Wow, tough question....Personally I think I would find somewhere else for my child. Tell your mom and step dad that you want your child to be around other kids even at a young age. There are a lot of day cares that have financial help for family's (we all know how crazy expensive day care is!!) Also you might want to look into a home daycare or a personal nanny. I have been a nanny for almost 3 years and it gives your child personal one on one care with someone you trust. I would not suggest a nanny agency however, they have a lot of fees and such. Post a local ad, mail boxes, rec center bulletin board, even craigslist.com, conduct interviews (away from your home for the first one) and narrow down your choices. If you go this route and the nanny comes to your home, your mom could still swing by and see that baby, that might be a good option! Hopefully I helped a little!! Good luck!|`|qStmw7qgaa	Have your mom watch the baby at your house and simply say "there is no smoking around the baby."  Period end of story.  Plus, it is easier to have you baby watched at your baby's home because then you don't have to move all their stuff to your mom's house.  Even 2 houses down it is a pain.  I was almost in this position, by my FIL quit before I had the baby so it worked out ok.  But I understand where you are coming from.  If your mom gets offended, you are simply going to have to say something along the lines of "I love you to death Mom..but this is my baby, and these are my rules."  I think she will understand.  She seems to really want to help you guys out.  Good luck.  I hope that it works out.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Tell her how you feel!  Why don't you have her watch the baby at your house since you live down the street?  I had a friend who was in the same situation as you.  her mom would come to her house to watch the baby.  If she needed to smoke she had a "smoking shirt" she would put on on top of the clothes she was wearing.  She would go outside and when she was done she would come in, take off the shirt and wash her hands.  She had no problem doing this because she understood why her daughter did not want her to smoke around the baby.|`|VqN3xV1uaa	Let your mom watch the baby, and don't worry about the smoke. If you could try to smoke a little bit yourself, the smell won't bother you, and everyone will be happy.|`|fjztyiXmaa	How about your in-laws? Ask them to look after your baby. Or just tell your mother not to pollute your baby's lungs with filthy cigarette smoke when she's looking after her/him.|`|TZzWGFNMaa	Tell her thanks for the offer but no thanks that you just don't want him around smoke...

You should never sacrifice your child's healthy and second hand smoke is a major concern. Your baby would have breathing issues as well as frequent sinus and ear issues. Its a bad idea all around. But if your mom would agree to watch the baby in your home and only smoke outside during nap time that would be better. If you can not afford daycare, see what government subsidy assistance is available to help you cover childcare expenses.|`|KUxEBQuYaa	my son has 3 sets of grand parents, only 2 are heavy smokers. just do i what i did. ask them to step outside to smoke. my mother will go into her garage to smoke while we are there. or she will go outside. my husbands mother and step father go into the other room or outside.|`|Mn5i27jMaa	My mothers a heavy smoker to.  Seconded hand smoke is more dangerous  to baby's and children.  That includes the smoke that is on your clothes.  Please click on the link below and read carefully.  <br>      I wont allow any one to smoke near my kids, or hold them after they have smoked.     If my mother in law wants us to come over I make her smoke out side the whole day, and if I smell smoke when I walk in, I walk out and go home.      My kids health is far more important to me then worrying about insulting a smoker.   Finding a good sitter is the better choice.    If money is an issue, they state welfare office can give you info on day cares that charge you on a sliding scale based on your income.|`|O8RuSBAjaa	It seems that it may be important to level with your mom on this issue. Perhaps if you put it in a positive light: that she is the one person that you trust to take care of your baby, but you would rather not expose your child to the cigarette smoke. Could your mom come to your house to watch your child and agree not to smoke while she is there? If it is really important to her to be involved with her grandchild's life in this way, perhaps she would be willing to compromise on this.|`|SxHvknWMaa	It sounds like you and your husband really want to start a family, and congrats. This is my 2 cents. If you choose to plan a pregnancy, make sure all of your ducks are in a row before you do so. If you cannot afford to stay home with your child, fwait a while, save money, find a way to work part time, ANYTHING you can to be more accessable to your child and to have more time with him. Its a tragedy when a mother is forced to have someone raise her child while she is working in an envirement she is uneasy about.<br>  <br>  As far as the smoking. It's just not healthy, it is VERY harmful for babies. You and your husband will be your childs protector. You have to be strong and make sure you do right by your child. If you don't want your child to be in your moms home with all that smoke, tell her no. I made the mistake by allowing my child to be cared for in a smokers home, he had to be rescusitated while in my arms, there is no fear like watching Dr.s and medics working on your unconscious baby. He had asthma.<br>  <br>  Make the right decision.|`|Yba724Wkaa	Daycare!!<br>  second hand smoke is bad maybe they would smoke outside if she really wants the baby over.<br>  My mom smokes and when my kids go there just for a short time they come home smelling as if they have been smoking.

If she cannot respect your wishes ; sorry just find someone else or maybe she would be willing to come to your house; where she knows u allow no smoking in the house.<br>  <br>  Also maybe get some litature showing what dangers of smoking and allergies in small babies r no determined yet.<br>  <br>  Building up their immune system is important to u.<br>  <br>  Maybe try to get your parents in the habit of putting their cigarettes out in a jar with a lid would help.  Sometimes if parents; see what all the nicotine in a jar looks like and how it effects the smell in their house is may have them look as wow I never knew.  I smoked for a short time and that is what stopped me by seeing what I was doing to myself.  We had no idea of dangers when we were raising kids.

A1S5KNUkaa	I felt exactly the same way on this pregnancy even though it's my 3rd and never worried before.  This is simply because I miscarried in Aug 2007 at 7 weeks and haven't been able to relax at all in this pregnancy especially when I had spotting at 10 weeks.  I kept telling myself I'd relax once I'd seen the scan but I didn't lol....I then had my 12 week scan and cried when I seen everything was ok but still didn't relax....listened to my little man's heartbeat at 16 weeks and still didn't relax....seen him at my 20 week scan and NOW I'M RELAXED! yay! lol<br>  <br>  It's perfectly normal to be feeling the way you are and take tissues with you because when you see your little ones heart beating and him/her wriggling all over the place you won't be able to stop the tears =)<br>  <br>  Congrats and let us know how you get on x x x x|`|v3LnJycKaa	they say once they find a heart beat that is strong and steady there is a significantly decresed risk of miscarriage...

You've already had a scan so you know your baby was all well a few weeks ago, after the heartbeat has been detected the rate of miscarriage drops down to 3% and after week 13 it drops to 2% so really you shouldn't worry. <br>  <br>  If it makes you feel any better, i only had sore breasts.

I remember in my first pregnancy, I was continually afraid that either my baby would die, I would die, or my husband would die. <br>  <br>  It's good that you are talking about it clearly. That in itself can make the fear less intense. And knowing that it is quite normal to feel that way at times. <br>  <br>  Listen to your intuition.

But I am just going to hope,and not dwell on anything negative,that will only drive me crazy!|`|ea6e861f02efbe475e33340ca6a879c3aa	You just described me until I was far enough along to feel my baby move.  And when she's sleeping, I still freak out thinking something is wrong.  I brought this up with my doctor at my last appt, and he said it is perfectly normal to feel this way, especially if it is your first pregnancy.  However, apparently it isn't a good thing to get too worried about it because it can stress the baby.  My doctor told me that you can get the sonar machines that listen to the baby's heartbeat with at some stores like Walmart or look online and they cost $20 and up.|`|L6tEwrLOaa	I was the same as you. Didn't feel pregnant and I was always scared about having a miscarriage. My doctor assured me if there was a miscarriage I would have severe cramping and bleeding. As well as passing a mucous like substance. Also it is normal to spot blood during your pregnancy, but anytime there is a lot of blood you should get yourself to the emergency. But if you haven't has any cramping like I've described Im sure you and your baby will both be fine:)|`|yOy5OpqFaa	Oh I was worried too only with this pregnancy though lol. When I went in for my 6 week ultrasound I thought the baby had died and when I went in for my 14 week I thought they would find no heartbeat but they did and everything is fine dont worry|`|AXEqOEloaa	It's hard not to feel this way sometimes but you cannot let the feeling consume you. Worrying and stressing is not good for the baby, just try and think positive. Wishing you well with your new bundle of joy, congratulations!|`|VWyW8tJXaa	I have my 12 week scan on wednesday! They found a heart beat around my 7-8 week mark. I am a little nervous. I already had a miscarriage before and it happened at 6-7 weeks. Good luck with your Appointment! I'm sure everything will be fine!|`|wlWCGGVIaa	worrying isn't going to do any good but make it hard for you. <br>  smile.. i'm sure your baby is perfectly fine :D:D:D <br>  xx|`|ApyrV5J9aa	I freak out every day. I am 11 weeks, 3 days today. Since I hit the 11 week mark I've been going crazy. I just haven't been feeling as pregnant for the past few days. I can have an ultrasound done almost anytime because I work at the hospital. I didn't want to overdo it but I did go in yesterday for a quick scan because I was terrified there would be no heartbeat. To our happiness, our baby was still there, heart beating like crazy and moving around all over the place! We could even see the fingers! I think it's natural to get scared over this, especially as you near that 12 week safety mark. Many people don't feel symptoms but if you have seen the baby and the heartbeat already, i think you will be fine. Best of luck to you. I'm sure you will get great news...and you'll be amazed at how much bigger it is than last time!|`|qisy7yuSaa	sweetie, i 100% know what your feeling, i had my 12 week scan on january the 20th this year and i was TERRIFIED for the whole week before hand, i was convinced beyond all hope that there would be no heartbeat and that the baby had died, i had no scan before that and i have had a previous miscarriage (at 5 weeks) so waiting for that scan that day was the longest moment of my life, it didn't help that they too me into the same room that they told me the bad news in last time! <br>  <br>  i dont know if you knew but once they find the heartbeat the chances of miscarriage are dramatically reduced, and everyday that goes by is a greater chance of a normal pregnancy!<br>  <br>  i posted this exact question on here before my scan, and it didnt really help, i hope my experience does help a little because all that worrying is for nothing and when tomorrow and you see your little one waving around, you'll do exactly what i did - cry tears of joy lol!<br>  <br>  p.s get some pics if you can (even if you have to pay!) i show them off eveyrtime i can, please have faith, i was sure something was wrong and now i'm finding out what i'm having next week! good luck! xxx
6lyAwIFPaa	The ones i have in the house it's a screw on end but it screws off the way it should screw on if that makes any sense lol..Hope you get them off! lol
GjuRYsITaa	i was on it, i was anti biotic at the same time that's how i feel pregnant this time round<br>  its a pain in the summer cause you get square patch marks! apart from that i found it fine|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Ooooh..tough question.  See, it can be effective after a week.  However, most health practitioners will tell you to wait a full cycle before letting lose in bed.<br>  I would get the morning after pill if I were you just be safe|`|JO8K7kxCaa	I think you should be fine. i had sex a week after starting n everything was fine.<br>  a good idea would be to have a prescription for Plan B too.<br>  I HATE THOSE STUPID SQUARE MARKS!<br>  i stopped using it tho i was starting to have heart complications because of it, strong chest pains and abdomn pains....
HdOVYIWjaa	I think it has something to do with your baby taking it's first breath before it is delivered.  I have also heard that children can suffocate on their own waste matters in a similar fashion, taking a breath too early.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	It could be the placenta stop working as it gets old (I hope that is a right way to put it). It stops working which means the baby will not get nourishment or oxygen from the placenta.<br>  Also babies passing a stool whilst inside you, it can lead to infections and possibly posioning. I remember when my waters broke they noticed there was meconium in my waters.<br>  <br>  That is what my midwife told me (I can't remember her exact words but somewhere along the lines). I think she said it to scare me into getting induced as I wanted to stay pregnant lol.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Could be lots of things. The first thing that pops into my head is deterioration of the placenta. That's one of the things docs keep a close eye on once you've passed your due date. That's certainly not the only thing though.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Meconium (babys first stool) in the amniotic fluid, too little amniotic fluid I believe are the most common causes.|`|sLERr3aAaa	A number of things the placenta stops working like it should amniotic fluid decreases and can cause cord compression.|`|mTl9l3aMaa	I guess just something goes really wrong on the inside.|`|28QPS6V9aa	Depends on the baby. One cause is they had a bowel movement in the womb and the baby swallowed it and caused an infection.
YEqQZgs5aa	I have the Ameda purely yours n i love it... its cheaper than the medala ones, easier to clean, your milk pumps directly into the bottle instead of going through tubeing, I use it with Evenflo bottles...<br>  <br>  I work full time and pump, and I LOVE IT...  I got the back-pack one because it came with a ton of extras, 6 bottle a cooler, the attachment for the lighter in your car, as well as a hand pump..<br>  <br>  You can google it, and also good medal vs avent pumps - and a ton of websites will come up with people comparing the 2..<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I was going to say the Medela Pump in Style, it is a lot of money but works really well.|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	If you don't have a lot of money to put out all at once, I would recommend renting one.  If you intend to pump, you really need a good one.  I rent the medela symphony.  It is great.  Very quite and fast.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Emw1PBqXaa	I used the Ameda Purely Yours breastpump and I loved it! You can check it out here <a href="http://www.ameda.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ameda.com/</a><br>  It runs about $150 and you don't have to do all the fussing that you have to with the medela pump in style. The Ameda is a closed circuit pump meaning all you have to clean is the parts that the breast milk touches, not everything like the Medela. Also you could get this used from someone and it would be okay since the mother's milk never ever can touch the motor like the Medela can. You can ask your OB about this, I got the Ok to use my cousins and you just buy the pumping accessories when you deliver. They cost about $30 to $50 at the hospital and the membranes last allot longer than the Medela's.<br>  <br>  I also want to add I used the Playtex drop in system with this pump. You can pump right into one of the bottles by using the Playtex blue caps that cover the container of a Playtex bottle. They come with an attachment that works with the Ameda. I also used Medela bottles too! The Ameda breast shield will screw into the Medela bottles.|`|DvrpBX4saa	Don't skimp on a pump! It's very important if you plan to bf and pump as well. I bought two cheap pumps and they were awful. The only good cheap pump is a manual pump (Avent Isis) but that's not a double. If you have insurance, your insurance might reimburse you for a pump. Mine did. Just call and ask them. Also, if you don't mind buying a used pump, you can get one used. The Ameda Purely Yours is perfectly fine to use because it has a special kind of motor that doesn't allow any milk back up into it's system (closed motor system). Just buy new shields and tubes and you'll be ok.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	I have one by The First Years called the miPump. I got it from Baby'sRUs and it was only 100 bucks. It comes with a ton of adapters and a nice tote to carry everything in. I would recommend it to anyone.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3393714" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|67FH2HoMaa	I had the Medela Pump in Style. But if you can not spend that much money then I would check into the first years mipump
HSUfe3m7aa	The actual odds of getting pregnant in any given month are VERY slim. Yes we all know people who get pregnant "like that" but they really are flukes.<br>  <br>  The sperm has to be there before ovulation, and it has to live long enough to meet the egg. The women's mucous has to be thin enough to let the sperm through and not kill the sperm. If the egg gets fertilized, it has to divide many many times properly just to make it through the fallopian tubes. If it makes it through, the uterus must have just the right amount of lining for the egg to attach. Then the body must successfully produce progesterone to allow the egg to stay attached, and the cervix to stay closed. Then the egg must produce HCG.<br>  <br>  It's not a simple as it looks! A normal, healthy fertile couple can need up to a year to get pregnant. And that's not counting if you're just coming off birth control.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard, but you have to be patient when creating a life :)|`|9f3784bdf3bdc20b62d4d53dedacfdfeaa	And?  We have been trying for 18 months|`|yp9rEMSraa	I really don't know what you are trying to ask but yeah there is a chance that you are not prego...It is sad but in any given cycle you only have a 25 percent chance of getting prego....sperm does live inside of you for 3 to 5 days but sometimes it just doesn't take....don't be discouraged though there is a lot of woman including woman on here that are going through the same thing you are....make sure you know your ovulation and body....best of luck|`|wOyyZjY0aa	When I saw my doctor on the same issue he informed me that even if we do everything 100 % correct and hit ovulation on the head, we only have approx. a 25% chance of conceiving.<br>  Why this is.....I'm not sure.  I didn't bother to ask, it is what it is.  This whole TTC thing in up to our bodies.  <br>  Hang in there!!!  Best of luck!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well it isn't a sure fire 100% that it will happen otherwise no one would have issues getting pregnant.
yp9rEMSraa	I would say the very end of the month you should be good or wait till the first of march to get a true sign whether you are or not|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I would test in a few days from now.  =)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well first off you won't be pregnant if you had sex 6 days after the start of your period.  Do some research into how cycles work.
i8Ch743Laa	I can't say this has happened,but I'm so sorry that you're going through these troubled times. My prayers are with you.|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	I'm praying for your peanut. I was diagnosed with a missed miscarriage that did not end well but have read many many stories that had happy endings here <a href="http://www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com/mycommunity/viewforum.php?f=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com/m...</a>
HSUfe3m7aa	1. Do you think she did the right thing?<br>  Absolutely. I don't advocate violence, but this was self defence.<br>  <br>  2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage?<br>  No, e should have thought about that. What if your sister had permanent emotional scarring because of it?<br>  <br>  3. What would you have done?<br>  Exactly the same thing.<br>  <br>  4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do?<br>  Yes I was at age 6. The school wouldn't stop it, so I did. He was arrested 10 years later for rape, he never changed.<br>  <br>  5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?<br>  His own fault, you are not allowed to touch another's body.<br>  <br>  6. How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation?<br>  I would support her 100%.<br>  <br>  7. How would you feel if it was your son in this situation?<br>  I would get him counseling and appropriate punishment.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	1. Do you think she did the right thing?<br>  Yes,  It was self defence and the boy in question shouldn't have sexually assaulted her.<br>  <br>  2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage?<br>  No.<br>  <br>  3. What would you have done?<br>  The same a your sister.  If someone sexually assaulted me, they wouldn't be getting off lightly.<br>  <br>  4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do?<br>  No I have never had it happen.<br>  <br>  5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?<br>  Although it was his fault.  I still feel bad.  He won't be able to have children and that isn't fair.  But at the same time, he shouldn't have done what he did.<br>  <br>  6. How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation?<br>  I'd just say, take the suspension.  And wouldn't do much more.<br>  <br>  7. How would you feel if it was your son in this situation?<br>  I would feel dreadful for him.  And I would hate the girl for doing it to him.  I would also tell him that touching a girl, anywhere, without consent isn't allowed.  And he has now had to deal with the repercussions of his actions.  I would still feel horrible for him and hope that someday he would be able to have children.|`|AA11481889	#1 I think that any woman who is the victim of a sexual assault has the right to defend herself within reason.<br>  <br>  #2 My answer is the same.  Her self defense was justified to an extent.<br>  <br>  #3 If it were me, I probably would have reported him...not physically assaulted him...it's not like she was in danger or in fear for her life...I believe her action was an excessive use of force.<br>  <br>  #4 I have been in a similar situation and I screamed at the boy and mortified him into an apology...he never bothered me again.<br>  <br>  #5 I feel bad that clearly his parents didn't teach him how to be a decent young man...and how to respect others, particularly women.<br>  <br>  #6 If it was my daughter, I would hope that she would use her brain before she used her steel toes<br>  <br>  #7 If it was my son, I'd sue your parents asses right out of your house, for sterilizing my son with a brutal physical attack, regardless of the provocation...and since his damages are permanent...we'd win.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	1. Do you think she did the right thing?<br>  <br>  Yes absolutely.<br>  <br>  2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage?<br>  <br>  No<br>  <br>  3. What would you have done?<br>  <br>  The same<br>  <br>  4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do?<br>  <br>  Yes. Constantly bullied through out school. Battered a girl. Bricked another one over the head.<br>  <br>  5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?<br>  <br>  You have got to feel bad for him he may never be able to have kids. But he is responsible for his own actions.<br>  <br>  6. How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation?<br>  <br>  <br>  In this day and age, what with my daughter being bullied from age 4. Good. She could well have stopped a future rapist.<br>  <br>  7. How would you feel if it was your son in this situation?<br>  <br>  Well I would be devastated that he may have future infertility problems but I would also think that he shouldn't have done what he did. 14 or not.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	I think the self defense rule only applies when your life is in immediate danger. I dont think she had the right to "self defense" when the boy touched her and then stopped, and then she turned around to get payback. Now had he have her cornered, and alone, and was obviously trying to molest, or rape, or cause physical damage, then yes, she would have the right to do whatever she had to do in order to get away from him and call for help. I might have hit him, or slapped him, but i wouldnt have kicked him there. I think he learned his lesson and will never do it again, but if i were his parents, i would have pressed charges, which im sure your sister could do too, but i think you sisters punishment would be worse than his. If this was my daughter, and this happened to her, i would have expected her to keep walking and told her teacher, or principle. Her retaliation didnt match the crime. Its like if someone grabbed your arm to pull you back when you were walking away, and then you turned around and stabbed them in the arm. It doesnt match.|`|R5ILa4Imaa	Your sister deserves a medal. That stinking boy will remember for the rest of his life what happens to perverts who stick their hands up girls skirts. There is far too much of this kind of thing going on in schools also bullying and the teachers cant or wont do anything about it. I hope it will be a lesson for the rest of the boys at her school.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Tell your sister good for her! I'm betting that boy has learned his lesson about grabbing at girls...and he definitely learned  the hard way. She should just suck up the suspension and enjoy her badass reputation. It could be much worse. His parents could be suing you. Your sister is a sister I'd be proud to call a sister!|`|n7uoE9wmaa	What the lad did was indecent assault; her reaction may have been extreme but not unexpected; it's a shame that the lad has been damaged beyond repair but she may have just done him the biggest favour ever; if he thought it was OK  and could get away with it he would  do it again and again, then maybe rape and probably end up in jail as a sex offender with that record for life; now he will  maybe think long and hard before he attacks a female again.  It is good that the two sets of parents have agreed to treat the matter as at an end; your sister could have been prosecuted for grievous bodily harm.  So quid pro quo really.  Hope all works out for Amy.|`|f1nX6thdaa	Some one needs to explain "self defense" to this poor little girl.  Had he been trying to rape her? Then yes this would have been an appropriate action. The kick was excessive.|`|2585e7e86671999b1b6f36975e39adf0aa	Wow.....<br>  1. No I don't think she did the right thing.  Do I think he was wrong oh absoulutley.  I just don't think that she should have taken it out on his gentitals.  <br>  2. No I don't think it should ever be appropriate for one child to kick another child between the legs.<br>  3.  I would have told someone, let the school handle it.  As a parent I would have maybe called the police and seen if there was anything they could do as that is in my opinion a sexual offense.<br>  4.  No I have never been in a situation like that but doesn't mean that I wouldn't know how to handle it.<br>  5.  Yes I do feel bad for the boy he is 14 and as Dr. Phil says children at that age aren't capabile of making logical desions as their brain isn't fully grown yet.  So the fact that he will have to live with that as an adult is sad.<br>  6.  If it was my daughter in this situation I would be very upset at the way she handled the situation but also very sad that she was the victim of a perverted child that can't control his impulses.<br>  7.  Thats tough, I would be furious obviously because of the permanate damage.  But in the same just as furious that he did what he did.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong if this happened as adults I would totally agree with the woman kicking the man but that is as adults who are able to make informed decisions.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry for your sister having to experience that but also very sorry for the boy that had to go through the pain he did.  Very sad situation!|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Well at 14 ..yes he was definately wrong to be perverted towards your sister and should not have done it but is very immature at that age, its a shame he now only has one testicle as thats fecked for life and cant be fixed.<br>  Maybe she should have hit his face instead.|`|758cDKEFaa	1. no she didnt, she over reacted.<br>  2. no it wouldnt.<br>  3. i would have called him and got on with it like a normal person would have.<br>  4. yeah i have, i lauged about it and got on with my life<br>  5. he didnt deserve that at all and i think he should press charges!<br>  6. i would have told her to do something about it, like call him or a harmless slap but nothing bad.<br>  7. i would tell him not to do things like that, but all boys do that some point so i doubt he would listen.<br>  <br>  also... self defense? you have to be joking its not like he was attacking or raping her!|`|7qNkIZzsaa	goodness.. thats the most serious ball-kicking ive heard of<br>  1. i think that she had the right intentions, but the language may have been a little harsh. however, she clearly REALLY kicked him,with serious injuries, so that is a definate no.<br>  2. My answer would be that your sister was defending herself and the boy would have just got the message without any lasting issues<br>  3. I would have done the same as her actually: only hoping not to destroy his bollocks.<br>  4.I have and i did this, but again with no lasting damage.<br>  5. I feel bad that he is now unable to have kids (i guess) and if he cant i dont think he deserves that, but i think a little nip wouldnt have been so bad.<br>  6. i would feel that she had taken it too far with the agression and reconsider her footware<br>  7. i would consider sueing if my son was made infertile...|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	I would have done the same thing that your sister done.  The little perv asked for it and any harm that came to him was a direct result of his awful behavior.<br>  <br>  I would have a meeting with the school board and object to the suspension - she is not at fault - she was sexually harrassed! And if they do nothing about it - I would seek legal representation on the sexual harrassment grounds.|`|AA12226861	I simply think as much as it sucks and I would have probably attacked her upon seeing her next,that she was right and you can sue for sexual harassment and the school and possible the boys parents could get in trouble.If that dont' work,tell her to do it again.|`|HKKu4CjEaa	I think she did the right thing, and at the same time she showed that she isn't one to be fukkked with all kind of ways.  I'm so sorry that the boy just happened to be fourteen, and is physically damaged to the point that he won't be able to reproduce later in life.   I mean, mistakes are meant to be learned from, but in this case the lesson was very severe and costly.  I guess, if she would have just slapped the shittt out of him, he would have got the same point, and still would have been able to have kids later in life.|`|HdOVYIWjaa	I think she should defend herself, but I think she took the wrong action.  Regardless of whether there was permanent damage or not, I do not think she should have kicked him hard in the groin.  I would have pushed his hand away forcefully, maybe even slap him, but definitely go to a teacher or principal to report it.  I have been in this situation and I reported it to one of my teachers and the boy was suspended.  I feel bad for the guy because now he has no opportunity to have children of his own.  He made a mistake and now has to deal with heavy consequences his whole life.  I would be upset if I was a parent on either side, although she defended herself, she still caused damage to this young boy that will affect his entire life.  I would be upset if he was my son knowing that I would not be able to ever have grandchildren by him.  They both should've thought about their actions before they did them.|`|IMzza26Aaa	While I think the boy deserved it her appropriate response should have been to tell someone in authority especially since she had witnesses.<br>  If he had grabbed her and forced her into an empty room or closet then I would say it was warranted however in this case since it was public and a "feelie" was all he got she should have just told someone.<br>  <br>  1.  Nope although I would have like to see it.<br>  2.  No, violence never solves anything.<br>  3.  Told a teacher or the principal.<br>  4.  Nope<br>  5.  He deserved it the little perv but getting kicked out of school without the injury probably would have done the trick.<br>  6.  I would hope that she would do as she has been taught, to tell someone in authority instead of a violent action.<br>  7.  I would be ashamed because I know I taught him better.  I tell my son almost daily that you should always treat women and everyone else with respect.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Yes i think she did the right thing, if he had not touched her first then she would not have had to kick him in the first place. I do agree that maybe his injuries were pretty severe but maybe it will teach him he can't just go around feeling girls up.<br>  <br>  I think ur going have a bit of a mixed feedback on this question though as i think the guys will have a different view to the women.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend thinks she's ruined his life and he won't be able to have kids.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	This is a hard one...I think that it was right of her to defend herself, and I don't think she intended on hurting the kid as badly as she did.  I would answer question number one the same as I did now.  She didn't mean to hurt him, but he got hurt because of a horrible thing that he had no right to do.  I would have probably done the same thing as your sister honestly.  I have been in a similar situation, I was older, but I had some grown man, reach under my knee length skirt and grab my butt.  I turned around, and punched him right in the mouth.  Not for a minute did I feel sorry for what I did.  I don't feel bad for any guy that does something like that...it's not the woman's fault that he cannot control his actions.  It was a piggish thing to do, and unfortunatly he learned the hard way.  If it was my daughter, I would support her no matter what.  Like I said, I highly doubt she meant to hurt him in this way, but it happened.  If this was my son in this situation, I would honestly be ashamed that a son of mine would treat another human being in this way.  I would feel horrible for my son and his medical outcome now, but at the same time, I would be more upset that it all could have been avoided if he'd have kept his hands to himself.  (Like I will teach my son!) lol<br>  <br>  Good luck to your sister!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	1- Making him stop yes, kicking in in the testicles no.<br>  <br>  2- No he will now never be able to have children and that is very wrong. He did something that alot of 14 year old boys do NO its not an excuse but he shouldn't have to give up alot of his future because of something he did with out thinking. <br>  <br>  3- I would have slapped him most likely, screamed for him to stop.<br>  <br>  4- In a way, but not with a skirt on. I slapped the guy<br>  <br>  5- Yes i feel bad for him. Think about the long run. He and his future wife will not be able to have biological children ever, he may fine a women who he loves and seeing a child with his dna will never happen and she may decided not to be in a relationship with him.<br>  <br>  6- I would feel she had been violated but angry that she caused such damage. Id be worried they would sue.<br>  <br>  7- know what he did was wrong but what the girl did was excessive, Id probably sue for medical cost.|`|k9q5eDnfaa	Was he doing it cuz he fancied her (boys will be boys) if so she has gone waaaaay overboard Did she warn him or say don't do that. If it was a real perv grope i can understand her reporting him or slapping his face. Had he done it before if so then if she felt threatened maybe a kick would give him the message but not in those Goth boots (They could be classed as weapons now and be banned from school) Would she have done this if she fancied him, a pinch on the bum is different when its someone we fancy isn't it.<br>  I feel for the guy I know he did wrong but for what he has had done to him im sorry but its way over the top <br>  We had a guy at a place where i worked who was always putting his arms round the women He did it to me once and i told him i didnt like it and he did it again so i said if he did it again i would break his arm He got the message! <br>  If it were my daughter who had her bum pinched and she didn't like it i would tell her to tell the teacher and then if he did it again i would go up to the school and complain and have him in the office and tell him to steer clear of her <br>  If it were my son and all he had done was pinch a girls bum at school i would sue her How can you even think he deserves this for pinching her bum This guy can never have kids They wouldn't do this to a rapist <br>  Just imagine if she had grabbed his bum and he turned round and punched her so hard that injuries meant she couldn't have kids.|`|lH29UxtSaa	1. NO! as a dude i kno how much it fookin hurt an dats without the fookin ruptures and crap, however, he shudnt of been a perv and so i think a good whack in the leg or even the face wud of been suffcient.<br>  2.nope you should never kick a dude in the testicles<br>  3. punched him the face or kick him in the leg<br>  4.nope im not a perv<br>  5.yes i do feel sorry for the kid now he is neva going to be able to have HIS own children because of a stupid childish act but it was his fault<br>  and i dnt no abouyt the last 2 questions|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	Do you think she did the right thing?<br>  1. Hell no!!<br>  <br>  Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage?<br>  2. No, what she did was very childish.<br>  <br>  What would you have done?<br>  3. There aqre more effective ways of letting someone know you are not happy with them. Words speak louder than actions.<br>  <br>  Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do?<br>  4. I either give them a dirty look or just IGNORE them. All they want from pinching your bum is a reaction from you - that's why they have done it in the first place - to be noticed!<br>  <br>  Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?<br>  5. I feel horrendous for the poor boy - your sister should be apologising to him endlessly. He has lost his manhood and this will effect the rest of his life!! Your sister can go on and have kids and will forget about the boy who pinched her bum, but this poor boy will remember that day for the rest of his life!!<br>  <br>  How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation?<br>  6. I would be gutted that I had raised such a selfish and childish daughter who cant see where she is blatently in the wrong.<br>  <br>  How would you feel if it was your son in this situation?<br>  7. I would be devestated, he will never have a familyand will always have to prewarn future partners that he will not be able to give them a child.<br>  <br>  Your sister should really be ashamed of herself.<br>  <br>  'He deserved it'.....?!?! I think everyone is going way over board, a 14 year old boy pinching a 16 year old girls bum is NOT sexual assult. It's just boys being boys. What she did was not self dense it was a cruel and evil thing to do. For a start she is 2 years older than him. If you ask me she has gotten off WAY too lightly. This whole question and all the RIDICULOUS answers it has received i making me sooooo angry. I can't belive some of the answers, I would love to see if 'he deserved it' if it was one of your sons coming home with infertility all because a girl overreacted and now is upset because she feels like she did the 'right thing'. Eurgh..I'm too angry - not even going to check this question again as I am spitting fire right now.|`|lIBKQAzSaa	self defense my @$$!!! she wasn't being raped... Your sister is going to grow up to be a trailor park whore. I see you sister being much worse than the guy. helli would even go as far as calling her a murderer... he had intensions of destroying his testicles so eh couldn't populate this earth even if he was a low life. Dont worry i'm sure your sister will have her sons testies lost to a stupid girl just like her. Such an over reaction..... She has anger issues dont worry karma's got her number so does god. god doesn't forget.....|`|hKJIDdVqaa	1. No she did not do the right thing.<br>  2. No my answer would not be different if she had not injured him.<br>  3. I would of notified the school and police and had him charged with sexual harassment.<br>  4. No I have not been in a similar situation where I have seriously injured a young man, yes I have been in a harrasment situation.<br>  5.Yes I feel bad for the guy, but it was his action that caused the consequences. No guy deserves to be kicked in the balls.<br>  6. My daughter would not be in this situation, she takes JU JIT SU :)<br>  she also maintains a certain demand of respect when she carries herself.<br>  7. My sons' would also not be in this situation, as they have been taught from a young age that women are to be respected, any form of unwanted touch to a woman is sexual harassment and can land you in jail.<br>  Now that your sister took the law into her own hands, the young man will become the martyr.  He will become the vicitim and she will become the bad guy.  As a woman she needs to learn to maintain herself.  The ends did not justify the means.|`|177b82427498ae7807cb61bc6d21d5e7aa	There was need for your sister to react in such a violent way. It was wrong what he did, she should have reported to the school, he would have then got the appropriate punishment.Her kind of self defence has resulted in him having a permanent disability, in that he will never be able to have any children, which is very serious.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	poor kid.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	1. Do you think she did the right thing? No.<br>  <br>  2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage? No<br>  <br>  3. What would you have done? I may have punched him, but not anywhere below the belt.<br>  <br>  4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do? Yes, I punched him. I was 13.<br>  <br>  5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved? He will probably be sterile, yes I feel bad for him.<br>  <br>  6. How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation? She would be in major trouble...like, huge.<br>  <br>  7. How would you feel if it was your son in this situation? I would be royally pissed. Touching a persons butt like that won't do any lasting damage, yet my son had to be hospitalized.<br>  <br>  And no, sexual harrassment isn't cool. But making it impossible for someone to have children because of something so petty is wrong.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	So sorry about the testicle. Guess he should have thought about that first. Dumbass. <br>  <br>  Once he's out in the "real world," if he tried that behavior he'd no doubt be arrested. The school should have a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and she should not have to put up with being groped. OK, she kicked him and did some damage - maybe a three day in school suspension - but she has a right to defend herself and it's her body. No one should touch her unless she gives them permission. <br>  <br>  If this had happened on the street and a woman was attacked or groped, the guy could only hope the worst he walked away with was a crushed testicle.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	1. Do you think she did the right thing? maybe, self defense for girls is a good thing, but she must have kicked him awfully hard for permanent damage<br>  2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage? no<br>  3. What would you have done? I probably would not have kicked boy in balls<br>  4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do? no not really<br>  5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?  I feel badly for him<br>  6. How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation? I would feel badly for her because I would know that she wouldn't have wanted to cause permanent damage<br>  7. How would you feel if it was your son in this situation? I would be crushed and angry
SKpnhCunaa	im the same way right now i missed my period for 6 days and neg. test... the test aren't allways reliable... i here of people taking tests and coming up neg. and then going to the doctor and said they were you sould go get checked out|`|eytlIKITaa	You very well could be.  Why don't you go to the doctors and get a blood test- since the HPT are BFNs-|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Could be anything really...those symptoms aren't exclusive to pregnancy.  Could be stress or some hormonal imbalance.  I would get it checked out.
YLXpwqceaa	They say a test can be positive 10-12 days and your period comes on the 14th day post ovulation (of a 28 day cycle).  My first pregnancy, that test showed positive on day 19.  It is still greatly possible for you!  I also read in my pregnancy magazine that 50% of people don't get a positive result until day 19 (as of a national poll).  So don't get discouraged, and if it is still negative in a few days time, go get a blood test for confirmation.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wOyyZjY0aa	Hello!  I have been in shoes twice now.  Three years ago, I had a very regular 28 day cycle.  When I did not get my period, I tested...nothing...BFN.  Three days later still no period and tested again....BNF.  So basically I tested:<br>  The day I was due for my period<br>  Three days late<br>  Five days late <br>  Six days late......and got negatives every single time.  I had always tested right away in the morning.<br>  I finally tested again on my 7th day of being late and got my postive.  SO it took my body 7 days to pick up the preg.<br>  However ( I don't even want to say it), but I was 6 days late last week.  I swore I was preg.....and got my preg on the 7th day.<br>  It's so hard to tell.  We are all different.  But if you are 6 days late you can always call you clinic.  At this point they will do a blood test.<br>  Best of luck!!!|`|fpZ014Uraa	well theres all types of reason a woman can miss a period for the month yes pregnancy is the most common but not always the answer you've seemed to had ruled that out and if your still curious i would see a doc for a blood test.<br>  <br>  Being Overweight<br>  Change in Schedules<br>  Change in Medications<br>  Illness<br>  Being Underweight<br>  Miscalculation<br>  Peri-Menopause<br>  Menopause<br>  Pregnancy<br>  stress|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, I was really really late dear.  5 weeks late to be exact.  So, it does happen!  =)  No fretting yet!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You can say your not stressing but that doesn't mean your not.  It is rough when you are trying to get pregnant and it takes longer than you like.  I would take a good quality test or a blood test and if it is negative then accept that and I bet your period will come.
veO1RXrCaa	Did you ever try Resultz?  That stuff is amazing. We were struggling for awhile to get rid of lice.  My niece had them bad and she would give them to my son.  I tried everything.  This is a anti-pesticide shampoo.  It takes the waxy coating of the lice and they dry out.  My only complaint is that its very oily and we needed to do several shampoo's with dish soap to get that feeling out of our hair.  But it worked.|`|im3vWyv6aa	Yes, there is an Rx lice treatment. I talked to my Dr. about it a couple of years ago when my girls were battling the bug. The Dr. wrote an Rx for me, but before I purchased the Rx I decided to try one more thing.<br>  <br>  I soaked their hair in vegetable oil and wrapped their hair in suran wrap... then I put a shower cap on and left it on for like 4 hours. After 4 hours rinse her hair in really warm water and shampoo.<br>  <br>  You will need to go through and try to pick out the nits. I did that before the oil treatment and after. Every day look for nits until you don't see them any more.<br>  <br>  Finally something worked and I didn't have to purchase that shampoo.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yes actually if you have had it more than 6 months and it kept coming back after treatment you are supposed to be seen by a dermatologist and they prescribe the good stuff but you also will want to let your school know because someone could be keep on giving it to you.|`|bVIewZe9aa	yep you can, if you're under 16 you will get it free (if you're from the UK), if not it will cost unless you're in full time education.<br>  when i was younger i was treated my full marks lotion.<br>  it works a treat.<br>  Emma (:|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Yes.|`|UiqRVbRGaa	yes|`|AA11329531	The most important thing to remember when treating for lice is to get rid of all the eggs in your hair. The comb might not be getting rid of all of them. You need to section off your hair and have someone go thru it very slowly a couple times a day and pull out any eggs that you might find. this is very important, if you miss one tiny little egg it will hatch and you will just keep going around in circles with this. It is also very important to clean EVERYTHING in your home. Wash everything you can in hot water and dry on hot. Anything that you can't wash needs to be put into a bag and push all the air out of it and it needs to stay in that bag for a couple weeks. Also, get rid of all hats, sheets, towels, blankets, combs, etc. that you have come into contact with. As far as your brother goes, shave his head - best way to get rid of it. good luck and stay on top of the eggs.|`|BTI0XOptaa	The ONLY safe way to get rid of head lice permanently is to use a totally natural alternative to the chemical shampoos then use prevention methods such as hairspray and tea tree mixed with water in a spray bottle every day to ensure they never return. <br>  <br>  Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a pesticide treatment (over the counter shampoo) please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. They are also ineffective as head lice have become immune to them.<br>  <br>  Luckily there are quite a few totally natural remedies available that readily kill head lice.<br>  <br>  Suffocation is an effective method where oil based products (i.e.: conditioner) are used to block the breathing holes and kill the live lice. The real trick though is to find natural products that will kill both the live lice and their eggs in one fast effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Remedies containing Neem Oil are known to be highly effective as Neem interrupts the growth and reproduction of the head louse. Neem’s insecticidal properties are widely recognized now and the oil is commonly available at your local health food store.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following site for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	My neighbor just took both her kids to the doctor due to the lice and they prescribed something stronger than the store brand. One time of using it and they are lice free. I suppose your problem is brushing it with the lice comb... we used a metal lice comb which was more expensive but one of the girls have really thick hair and broke the plastic ones. The doctor told us to use mayo to loosen the nits. I hope that helps.|`|f1nX6thdaa	yes, I think there is an oral medication that you can use.  My little sister in law had lice off and on for about 5 yrs!!! horrible, I know!  The main problem was, that she wasn't treating her hair properly.  You have to follow the directions.  you have to painstakingly comb EVERYTHING out of your hair...bugs and eggs and then retreat, and retreat as necessary. You may be better off cutting your hair short.  Hair grows back! I couldn't imagine going thru head lice!!!!! good luck!|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Yes, the doc's do have some kind of a prescription stuff for lice treatment, I had to use it as a child.  I also had really long hair...but I ended up having to cut some off because of the lice.  No fun at all!  Good luck!  I hope you get rid of them!|`|sMlNvnxmaa	Ha going throw the same thing with my girls! I just called my kids doctor and they called something in! Good luck!|`|AA12226861	yup|`|cUamLDj3aa	yes there is my daughter had problems getting rid of them but they will give you some good stuff. go and see him|`|BiXgj1meaa	yh but they might just provide a prescription to go get it at the chemist
6lSbmXunaa	By age 13, I'm sure they've taught her about it in school or she's heard about it already. Schools normally cover the topic in health class.  The answer above me had a good suggestion though, if you feel it necessary to talk to her yourself.|`|sVbZEWveaa	I think you should try by showing her movies of the outcomes of sex before you are stable. Like the money 15 and pregnant. I think you need to open the lines of communication because in reality these days at 13 girls have already had sex. Its not good but they are starting younger and younger!|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Honestly, at 13 I was already having sex. <br>  You need to hurry.|`|bfP8tjPKaa	Yes she might have HEARD about sex, but I am sure it is 100% better to hear about it from your mother, so first I would like to comend you for being the caring mother you are! <br>  *Go to the nearest womens clinic or free clinic [by yourself]<br>  get a series of brochures on BIRTH CONTROL, STD'S, AIDS, FAMILY PLANNING, SEX ETC.,<br>  *Sit her down, and tell her you want to talk to her about sex, you do not want her to feel embarassed in any way what so ever and you want her to know that you are open to ANY questions, no limits.<br>  *Show her the brochures; perhaps read them together and DISCUSS your thoughts, tell her at her age her body is going through changes, and it is NORMAL... BUT sex should not be an option until atleast 16, show her the dangers, if she wants sex at an early age, urge her to confront you and tell you so that you can the take HER to the nearest clinic and get her on birth control. Also add, birth control isn't enough it will not shield her from STD'S tell her use a condom as well. MAKE SURE she gets on a SAFE method of BIRTH CONTROL ( I urge you not to let her get the shot, it has ruined my body, I am having trouble concieving)|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Chances are she already knows. Or she thinks she does from what her friends have told her.<br>  <br>  Be realistic. Explain feelings, and hormones, and changes. Explain that boys can be persuasive. Let her know she can come to you. Talk about birth control and where she can get it without having to talk to you. Tell her how sex can complicate things, how emotions can get involved.<br>  <br>  Most of my friends at that age (I'm 30 now) were already having sex.|`|hswTS1jVaa	She probably already knows the basic stuff so it's more important to talk about protection, myths about sex/boys, abstenence (or whatever you belive in) and respecting herself and her body.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Discuss-Sex-with-Your-Child" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Discuss-Sex-with-...</a>|`|AA10196172	Honestly - from movies, songs, the internet, Tv and especially their friends - maybe you should ask her to tell you about it.<br>  <br>  I had one co-worker several years ago who asked if we thought she was harsh; she told her daughter she could not go to her friend's baby shower, even though all the other kids in the 7th grade were going.<br>  <br>  So maybe start the talk as an adult conversation - "You're at the age I need to talk to you about this stuff. I suspect you already know a lot more about this than I did at your age." Then see what she knows.<br>  <br>  Tell her the main concerns that kids should know - STD's and pregnancy - and be sure she understands what to do to stop them and those sorts of mechanics of sex.<br>  <br>  Tell her that - like drunk driving when she's old enough to drive - you would rather she come to you, no recriminations, you won't bring it up and lecture her in the future. If she needs some help to avoid a bad situation, she can call and you'll come and get her, help her, whatever she needs.  <br>  <br>  I assume you have or will do the discussion about not letting herself get talked into anything from peer pressure or the need to fit in.<br>  <br>  The other important thing about sex that evryone should know - the largest sex organ in the human body is betwen the ears. Sex messes with your mind, makes you do stupid things, and makes youignore common sense. Listen to all the songs on the radio - they're not so much about physical sex, but about breaking up, loss, getting back together, etc. This is probably the hardest part for anyone, especially 13yo's to understand.  Even if you're on birth control, doing what comes naturally with no restraint is going to hurt you just from the immaturity of some teens when it comes to relationships and commitments. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	I have two, grown now, daughters and I opened the conversation when they were 11 and 10. I started by talking about feelings and love and then when they got a little older, I asked them what they knew and went from there. <br>  <br>  This is not a one time sit down talk in my house. I was constantly interjecting thoughts, feelings and rules into everyday conversations. Sure at first they were really uncomfortable with my comments, but they grew to be ok with it. And the more I talked about it, the more comfortable I became about it.<br>  <br>  I made sure they felt comfortable with telling me if they needed to get protection no matter what age they were (within reason), even if I didn't agree with the decision. And I would make a point of asking at least once a week, just to get the talk going. They both had boyfriends in freshman year, but my oldest was not sexually active until age 18 (same boyfriend) and my youngest, who is 19 is still a virgin.<br>  <br>  Just spark up the conversation when you two have some alone time. talk about falling in love first and then move to the physical act. My favorite conversation with my daughters involved what the boys try to say to get the girls to give in (taken from my past experiences). It was all very casual and like I said...it was a constant conversation.|`|D0oqTblpaa	You never know if your daughter is getting the best sex ed thanks to the Bush Administration's stance on abstinence only sex ed.  <br>  <br>  Here is a great website that will help you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://parentingteens.about.com/od/teensexuality/a/teen_sex_talk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parentingteens.about.com/od/teens...</a><br>  <br>  It is very important that you do talk to you daughter otherwise she could get her information from other girls and we all know how much they know. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to be a grandmother in the next 5 years I'd talk to her today.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Ask her what she thinks she knows about sex. That way you can be sure that you correct any misconceptions that she has.<br>  <br>  Then explain sex to her. The act, the feelings involved, the consequences. If you believe that you should wait until marriage, let her know that.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	talk to her about it when she gets her period. thats a good way to get the convo to start. just be like "you know why your getting this ight? now your able to have babies. even tho you should wait til your with a boy that really loves you and your financially stable blah blah" then go on with the birds and the bees.|`|EelbVaToaa	Approach her as if you were her friend.  That will make her feel comfortable.  Do you think she is sexually active?  <br>  <br>  SHE WILL APPRECITE THIS TALK.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Chances are she's already learned about if in school or from her friends.  Sit down with her and ask.|`|hpJdK2ULaa	Just tell her you want to talk to her about sex. Its alot easier then you would think. I wish my mom would have just said it that blunt (i am 20 btw) it works for a shy teen and a blunt one. I still embarass my mom, she was looking for a "sexy mag." for her boyfriend for Valentines day, and when the cashier noticed we were looking for something he asked to which i replied "where do yall hide the pornos?" my mother is very timid about the subject so i brought it up, after losing my virginity so blunt i believe is better before they ask you afterwards|`|oyINZiNDaa	talk to her about the changes her body goes through when she starts goin through puberty an when she gets her period use correct terms for body parts...tell her how men an woman have kids.....let her know that it is painful an how its supposed to happen once your married an on your honey moon...How its supposed to happen with the person you'll always love and ask her if she has questions that you rather her hear it from you then her friends an her get the wrong message or idea|`|4QuFVM38aa	you dont need to, im 17 my parents didnt tell me i learnt from school basically<br>  <br>  EDIT: and to whoever gave me a thumbs down...im in the UK not American. Also if your raised with anything of a decent brain you wont be stupid enough to take silly risks, as well as fiding out information on your own.
ODosyM8zaa	Do you choose C-section for health reasons or just because you don't wish to go through labor (Lol i don't blame you if this is the reason)? Is there a way around c-section? Such as natural birth? If you and your doctor both think you can handle another child by c-section then go for it! Good luck! ****baby dust****|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I am having my 4th child and 4th c-section april 14th =) As long as your previous c-sections were normal, not alot of scar tissue etc. then your fine =)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Talk to your doctor not us
6VR19YQWaa	Any line, even very faint, is considered positive under most circumstances. There is no way to be 100% sure without a blood test from the doctor, but the odds are certainly on the positive side.|`|yPNvecc7aa	I think there is a faint line. Get a First Response test. My Clear Blue test looked like that at first, and the same day I did a First Response test which showed me a faint but clear line.<br>  <br>  I don't wanna jinx you... but I think you might be pleasantly surprised if you re-do the test tomorrow! hihihi!!|`|AA10747002	It appears that there is a line. Get the test that states pregnant or not pregnant, it is the easiest and no second guessing.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Yes I see a faint line. I had to convince everyone that there was a faint line on my pregnancy test. No one could see it, everyone thought I was crazy. I'm now 22 weeks pregnant. Best wishes to you.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	ok now I see it, but if you have to look that hard, you really need to wait a day or two and test again.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	It looks like a line to me.  It is a very early pregnancy.  If you test again first thing in the morning, your line will be more clear.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	That is really hard to tell and I would just take a digital to get a straight answer.|`|qHa4w8eyaa	I see a line too...and although it's faint, it is PINK!  Congrats!!! :)|`|gwuTKiNXaa	very light but yes I can see it|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	I kinda can yeah!! It looks like a line! Congrats!!|`|HSUfe3m7aa	I see the line. Test again in 48 hours with first morning urine. Is this before you period is due?<br>  <br>  I have used those tests with success, they can get a evaporation line. But the evap line doesn't show color, and usually only appears if you waited too long to read the test.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I see the start of a line at the top,but it doesn't go all the way to the bottom of the test...

Yeah, defiantly retest in a couple of days... even tomorrow!!!|`|1s3nddaYaa	its like half a line, but i see it
AA12205301	Yes it is still possible to get pregnant even when he doesn't*** inside you. there is this stuff called pre-*** that has sperm in it. That comes out before he actually ****.  It is used for lubrication and for cleaning out the tubes before the actual stuff comes out. And what do you mean what do you do?   You either abort or have it.  Start using protection or better yet DO NOT HAVE SEX UNTIL YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING AND CAN MAKE WISE CHOICES!!!!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Yes it is very possible that you got pregnant. There is always pre-c*m and he doesn't have to ejaculate to get you pregnant.<br>  Condoms are so much cheaper than children, get some.|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	Yes it is still possible for you to get pregnant, a man releases pre-come when he gets an erection, this can get you pregnant, whether you had sex for 1 second or 1 hour. Get yourself some sex ed.|`|uuHPneEcaa	if u had unprotective sex then chance of getting pregnant is greater. Yeah he didn't nut in ur but there is something call pre nut THAT CAN ALSO get u pregnant. And u are pregnant, u can keep the baby, put it up for adoption or abortion (I am 100% against that) but its up to u.. no one can tell u what to do on that. <br>  <br>  Wait until u have a miss period before going out and buying pregnancy test , and how old are u|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You can still get pregnant off of precum so yes, it is possible.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	This past Saturday night?? Run NOW get the morning after pill at your local pharmacy!! NOW,GO! <br>  If you're under 18,you will need someone who is over 18 with an ID to get it for you..|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Completely possible. you should take a test and talk to your parents.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	Sorry to tell you, but that is how I now have my beautiful 3 1/2 year old daughter.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, look into your options.  I dont' know how old you are, but I think you should talk to your parents though.  If you are old enough to choose to have sex, you're old enough to take on responsibilities and fess up.  My parents (think 1950's tv parents) didn't even know I was active.  I had to tell them that not only was I not a virgin, but I was pregnant and 6 1/2 months along.  Nothing in my life was worse than that conversation.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope you do the right thing.  (take a test first, before you go ahead and tell your parents just in case you're wrong.  you dont' want to get them all upset for nothing)|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Yes you can get pregnant, as the "withdrawal" method you describe is notoriously unreliable.  Go to your doctor or Planned Parenthood clinic today and ask about available contraceptives.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	ummmmm yes it is called pre *** and it is what can make you pregnant. Buy a test take it and then find the outcome|`|23bs0kAKaa	OMG YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HUN if you dont know that you shouldnt be having sex!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... <br>  <br>  Men pre-cu.m and yes you can be pregnant!|`|gYkQc8Lraa	yes . precum can get you pregnant|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Yes of course it is.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	there is such a this called pre-cu-m ... and that can get you pregnant|`|pM2EQ4MQaa	When you don't use protection you have a greater risk of getting pregnant anyone knows that.<br>  <br>  Also, it is still very possible for you to be pregnant even if he didn't *** inside of you. the pre *** could still possibly get you pregnant.<br>  <br>  If your pregnant you should start taking care of yourself. If you don't think you can handle a baby then you shouldn't be having sex.|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	You can get pregnant from pre ejaculation. So there's still that possibility you can be pregnant. I would recommend getting a hold of some plan B even though it's been a couple days since that day. <br>  <br>  You have a couple options if you are ~ keep the baby, abort or better yet, give the baby up for adoption. I bet there are families out there dying to have a child because they can't get pregnant themselves.<br>  <br>  But before you make any decisions, wait until you know for sure if you are pregnant or not.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you get the answer your looking for.|`|AqU180claa	It is very possible. His Pre-*** can easily make your pregnant. Even if he pulls out.  I  know of someone that had sex with their bf without a condom and the guy pulled out and the girl got pregnant of of his pre-***.  ( Pre-*** is if the guy is really excited and juices alittle before he has his orgasm.)|`|94kNwMPdaa	its always possible to get pregnant whenever you have sex whether its protected or not. .<br>  the pull out method is NOT a method. there is a thing call precum that contains almost as much sperm as ***. <br>  <br>  if you dont get your period ontime then i suggest taking a pregnancy test.|`|3w7VztEWaa	Omg yes! wow..You have MORE of a chance to get pregnant without a condom how old are you.<br>  And yes it is possible.. men precum and thats just as dangerous if not more.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Very possible. Don`t take such chances is you don`t want a baby!|`|AA10888312	theres a chance if he didnt pull out in time some still might have got in there.
eTx3Nfd7aa	a man does not have to ejaculate for semen to escape if you are having sex whether you actually ejaculate or not it is possible for a girl to get pregnant wear something on the end of it and the only 100% effective way of not getting pregnant is don't do it at all.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It's the fluid that leaks out even before ejaculation, it still contains semen, and thus can cause pregnancy.|`|mxixfE3Raa	Yes.|`|EUTRJqCsaa	it's fluid that comes out of the man before ejaculating. it helps with lubricating. you definitely can get pregnant from it.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Precum is a type of personal "lubricant" that the male body produces before they actually "***" yes you can get pregnant from it even if they never actually finish.|`|7IHMjy2caa	Pre-ejaculate is the fluid that comes out before ejaculation. Yes, you can get pregnant from it. It does contain viable sperm|`|34HZwC29aa	As seems to be agreed here, yes you can get pregnant, even if the boy doesn't 'finish'. This is why the withdrawal method  is not a safe method of contraception......the most effective way to be safe from pregnancy and STI's when having any sexual contact is.....you guessed it..... condoms :)|`|7BaHGMEyaa	pre-... is when a man ejaculates a tiny amount before he goes for a full blow :) and yeah you can't stop pre-... and it only takes one sperm to get pregnant.
2n0B4cY6aa	Alot of excercises can and sports such as horse riding etc|`|zdGpaFlfaa	it could|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Why do you want to break your hymen?<br>  Nobody will be able to tell. lol.|`|rjVALevtaa	Nope. It may help stretch you out a bit, but you'll still have part of your hymen in tact. The only thing that will break your hymen is intercourse.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Bike riding, horse ridding.. stuff like that.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	there is a chance it can|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	it could my sister broker hers falling off a swing|`|KOwzDLPdaa	It could, it depends on your body. I broke mine horse back riding when I was ten. Not fun. Are you trying to make it happen or avoid it...|`|OLy54IDOaa	it could any vigorous activities|`|jLLkSWyiaa	it could
e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Yeah if you see Coco butter Pregnant. Use that one.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	for stretch marks? No, it will not help, nothing is proven in preventing stretch marks. My mom never had them, and I have them bad. I also had gained a lot of weight before I got pregnant, and I feel that is why I have them, since my skin was already stretched. I wish coco butter worked, I tried but it failed.|`|90zcKChJaa	The development of stretch marks are purely genetic. Rubbing cocoa butter on yer belly every single day will help keep your tummy soft, and may help the intensity, but it will not stop the stretching of the skin. <br>  <br>  You are either lucky or unlucky when it comes to stretch marks. Good luck!! ;)|`|cJRFbZUaaa	It will moisturize your skin so it's less itchy, but it won't prevent the stretch marks.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	it could but theres no garentees ... try using any lotion with vitamin e in it and apply regularly|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Yes cocoa butter is good to help with stretch marks. It's best to start using it early|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Nothing will prevent stretch marks, its all determined by genetics, no matter what some lucky skinny, stretch mark free mother of two tells you she did that worked for her. It is always depending on your individual genetic make up and how much elasticity is in your skin.<br>  <br>  But go ahead and routinely rub yourself down with cocoa butter because it feels good and is good for you! Or better yet, have someone do it for you. Sooooo relaxing :o)|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	My sister in law told me that the palmers coco butter stuff worked for her and that she had almost no stretchmarks where she put it... but she did say that she ended up with them on her butt. I don't know if that means lower back or what but she said she didn't put it there!  Just keep an eye out for strange places that they may pop up!  I've been using it but not for long enough to tell you from experience.|`|lhAVoXNMaa	doctors say nothing will prevent stretch marks...if you get them you get them...but ive been buttering my self out since i found out i was pregnant at 7 weeks and im 36 now and i have none...i do it 2x daily...i used tummy butter though cause its more oily and relieves the itch longer...lotion and regular cocoa butter dries up too fast! hope this helps!|`|qrC5mnd5aa	yes coco butter its safe to use ,my doctor told me to use it in my 1st pregnancy & i did & thanx god nothing happened|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Will it help you do what?
S5n5Za78aa	so i think you should tell your doc exacally what you told us cause he will be able to help you better in case you are preggo your not harming your baby|`|aWkp6AJOaa	it's possible, it sounds as if it may be implantation bleeding.  if you don't start in the next day or so i would take a test.  you may even be able to take one now.  you can get them for $1 at the dollar general or dollar tree stores.  they do work, i used them for my last couple of pregnancies.  <br>  i would definitely find out if you are pregnant before you take the provera, this will cause you to lose the baby if you are pregnant.<br>  good luck.|`|eP729T0Qaa	I went through exactly what you are going through. I got my period after my first round of Clomid really late as well. I think what you are describing is a period getting ready to come. I would wait it out and see if it is a full fledged period before you take the provera. You may end up not having to take the provera. By the way, after taking Clom lid for two cycles I got pregnant after trying for almost two years! Good luck to you!
NPAQxqgNaa	It's chicken "pox", and you can only get them once.|`|AA10624857	Chicken pox are only a potential danger to an unborn baby if mom comes down with them.  While it can happen, most people have immunity after they have chicken pox.  Few people get them more than once.  Even if mom does come down with chicken pox, the risks to the unborn baby are low with less than 1% of babies being born with birth defects or abnormalities if exposed in the first trimester.  The risk is even less in the second trimester with the greatest risk of being exposed just before birth since that could cause the baby to have chicken pox as a newborn.  You can check with your doctor for a professional opinion, but from the statistics I am familiar with, you nor your baby should be at any risk.|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	you may or may not have the antibodies to protect your unborn child from catching it and dieing in the womb. even if you have had it . many people can get it for a second time or develop shingles. it is very dangerous to your unborn child. <br>  <a href="http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/communicable/Fact-Sheets/Chickenpox-Pregnancy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/c...</a>|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	It used to be that once you caught chicken pox, you developed immunity and could never catch it again. However, in these days with so many viruses and bugs mutating, things are changing. I know two people, old childhood friends, who had chicken pox when we were little, then had it again when we were older teenagers already out of high school. <br>  <br>  Although you'll probably be fine, check with your OB-GYN just to be on the safe side.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Well they usually say that you can't catch chicken pox twice and I've never known anyone to have them twice. You should be ok. You can't quarantine your 5 year old :-). Just be sure to wash your hands after you touch her and keep some Lysol around.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	you will be ok, but a nurse told me that when you are pregnant the baby should not be near someone who has chicken pox or shingles (adult form of chicken pox), so I would give your doctor a call|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	No. your body are stronger. won't be happen. nope. If you still afraid and just check pregnant stuffs on internet.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	you are going to be fine. Im sure you are worried about your unborn and from what i have read the only time chicken pox is harmful to an unborn baby is if the mother contracts them before the baby is born. Since you have had them before you are already immune to the virus so you will be fine. If you are really concerned then please call your ob.|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	I'd check with your dr. to make sure you don't need to take any extra precautions so you somehow don't give it to the baby.  Most of the time once you have it, you're done but every once in a while, someone gets it twice.  I'm not sure though if you could transmit it after becoming immune.  Ask your dr just incase.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	If you have had them before than you already have the anti-bodies and should be ok. mention it to your doctor as soon as you can though just to be on the safe side.|`|AA11573305	It is just how it goes you only have chicken pots once in your whole life and you cant ever have them again.Ever so you will be just fine don't worry.God bless you and your family.|`|d96SSlrIaa	Yes you'll be ok.|`|GOFsAwHDaa	you will be fine but be sure to always wash your hands and to avoid scratching them...|`|AA12374184	Are you allright in the noggin? My god whats wrong with you!!?
Xc8dd6t4aa	I had a similar experience.  Not trying to get pregnant, but sexually active, and had a one day "period" that came a couple days late.  Also had some cramping.  I took an at home test that read positive, but when my fiance and I went to the doctor to get a blood test it came back negative.  We were told it was most likely due to other factors including recent stress at work and an increase in physical activity (I had started training for a half marathon that month...).  Take a test at home, and follow up with a doctor if you have any doubts about a negative (or positive) test result.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It can take up to a year for your periods to become regular again after you get off the pill.|`|yp9rEMSraa	You could be prego...If it was light like you are saying it was and for only one day i would do a test...Yes there has been a lot of women on here that have had implantation bleeding and thought that it was a light period...i would advise to do a PT test....
RxkGpV7xaa	AOL Parental Controls are brilliant for that! They're a bit tacky at first, but once you get used to them, they're really good for things like that. <br>  <br>  <a href="https://parentalcontrols.aol.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">https://parentalcontrols.aol.co.uk/</a><br>  <br>  If you're not with AOL, you can obtain a free screen name. <br>  You can control what sites they can access (and it comes with templates as well, which are under twelves, young teen, mature teen, and adult).<br>  <br>  If you're unsure of something, let me know...<br>  <br>  <br>  Edits:<br>  AOL Parental Controls are completeley free. <br>  You can set up different restrictions per different child screen name (access name).<br>  It's supported by other security software (qoute bottom right of link)|`|UwrVK72aaa	We use Weblocker.

When you set up the preferrences, it will let you put in sites that you approve 100%, so it'll never block them, and you can have it filter ONLY adult sites and allow everything else.

You will receive a email when they go to a site not appropriate for their age and you can also have it set up to send you a text message on your cell phone. what I like about it is it sends you the link your child accessed and you can go to the page they went to and check it out.
PAhdlQ5eaa	Take him to court...but we able to prove that you are now financially liable and sound.  It's alot of money to raise a kid.|`|UwrVK72aaa	Just go to court and get custody back. All you have to do is prove that your house is a good place to be and you should get custody back. Seeing as to how the courts would rather a child be with the parent than anyone else.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	You will need a lawyer and to prove to the judge that the circumstances surrounding giving her up no longer exist. You will have to prove you have a more stable home, job, etc than he does.|`|52U22fiAaa	You'll have to go to court.  She is your daughter though, so you'll likely get her back if the court sees you are fit to be parents.
WbaSpiYpaa	I think you are really close to going into labor.  Most women get this restless feeling near the end, and odd pains.  Do you have a spouse to help you?  If so, then let him take some of the responsibility off of your shoulders.  If you feel the baby is not moving properly, I would go to your doctor, and get checked out to be sure.  Take care of yourself, because you'll be very, very busy very soon.  Good Luck to you.|`|aLkCxq5aaa	Hi, just wanted to say I'm completely with you.  I'm 39+5 weeks and I'm having every pain you've listed from start to finish, plus I have an 8 year old and 20 month old too and it's bloody hard going sometimes!<br>  I've noticed lately that I'm weepy if I've had one of my bad nights where I can't get to sleep til 6am then up at 8am again, so must be the tiredness getting to me.  I'm just glad half term is over with so I can have a nap daytime with my daughter to catch up while my son is at school!  I don't think people realise how hard it is being so tired and heavy and keeping up with chores and children!<br>  I'm convinced I've been in slow early labour for the last week as my baby is posterior, and for the last couple of nights been woken up by intense braxton hicks and sharp pains in my cervix and just keep thinking "this is it!" but then after a while everything stops! <br>  <br>  I think that as it's the last of a very long 40 weeks, it's a mixture of impatience, anxiety, excitement and tiredness...and all that on top of a womans days work!  so it's no wonder we feel a bit weepy!  <br>   <br>  Sorry I'm not offering any real advice but I thought I'd share with you my similar grumbles so that u know you're not the only one.  <br>  Roll on a few weeks time when we can relax with a glass of wine at the end of the day eh?!<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon and have a great labour and birth, not long now!!<br>  <br>  Take Care xx|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Sorry to hear you're suffering.  Every pregnancy is different.  It sounds like your body is getting ready for delivery though.  It's probably worse for you because you have to look after your other baby too.  You can call your doctor or midwife for reassurance and advice between now and delivery time.  Also ask your friends and family for help so you can get some rest.  Good luck!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Okay relax. Take plenty of nice warm, but not overly hot baths. If the pain ever feels like its forming a pattern you probably remember from your first to start timing them to determine if they are contractions or not.<br>  <br>  My second one was very different too. The last week was agony and I just wanted him OUT!<br>  <br>  Hang in there hun and best of luck!|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	you are in labour call the midwife or doctor now cos wen you feel like going to the toilet that is yourbody way of telling you the baby is coming anytime soon.|`|SfludeD5aa	I felt like that at the end of my last pregnancy, your body is just tired. The tightening is probably Braxton Hicks, try sitting in the bath tub filled with warm water.|`|o9u4H6m6aa	Oh hun,<br>  <br>  I'm sure lots of us can relate! It's time to call in the friends and relatives to take the toddler out for a few hours so you can get some rest.<br>  <br>  Ask everyone else to cook meals for your family. If you feel like you need a rest with peace and quiet, then try to get some. Take a warm bath with epsom salts or try a hot pack to relax your back. Try sleeping in various positions with a lot of pillows. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you're having lots of braxton hicks contractions. That's great! Your body is getting ready for labor.  It's normal for babies to not move much towards the end cos there's not much room. Feeling like doing a no 2 is probably the baby putting pressure down there. Pain in the pelvic bones is because the joints between the pelvic bones are expanding  to make space for baby to come out. All this is good (though uncomfortable).<br>  <br>  Take some time for yourself without your toddler. Go for a walk, enjoy your time, breathe.<br>  <br>  Have fun! :>|`|6PEOqeLOaa	are your back pains happening the same time as when you are having contractions if so call your doctor you might finally be going into labor!! if not get an ice pack or take a hot shower and let the water hit your back.

Why not South Africa or any other country? Why not the children in England in the "system" ?
c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Yes there is a chance. My friend at work got false negs for a month before she got her BFP. It is very common for women to have a lighter shorter period instead of the normal flow when in early prengancy. Also if you have been vomitting, that is a sure sign unless you have some kind of virus. I hope you get what you are looking for!|`|BTf36bukaa	Sorry, it does not sound like you are pregnant. It is not very likely that you would still be getting negs. if you were. Although some people have had it happen, it is not the norm. Good luck next month!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You might of conceived but it didn't take and you could be starting to get your period.
fOxS7EE7aa	nope, you're definitely not pregnant because your period came on.|`|BTf36bukaa	No, if your period came then you are not pregnant.  Even when doing everything right, sometimes it just takes a while.|`|53GH38Qiaa	If you got a regular period then no. You may however have a lighter shorter period that would actually be considered implantation bleeding. So IF your period was lighter than usual or shorter than usual, take a pregnancy test just to be sure.|`|ilZkHdKcaa	No, if you got your period you are not pregnant. I was ttc at 19 years of age and didnt use bc it still took me a year too concieve. But after that was able to concieve again right away.

AA11540024	every pregnancy is different. Peeing alot is normal. Your baby is pushing down on your bladder that causes you the need to use the bathroom so often. :)|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	If you're pregnant, that's normal. I'm actually surprised your first didn't have the bladder issue. If you're worried, call your doctor. However, it sounds pretty normal at this point. In a few weeks it should ease up though.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	If you are dehydrated, then you are urinating too much.  Even if you aren't, you can see the doctor to make sure you don't have a bladder infection or diabetes causing you to go to the toilet so much.  If your frequent bathroom trips are from the uterus pressing on your bladder, you can get advice on how to empty your bladder more completely.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	u should feel lucky lol i did that too at 3 months but i am 7 months now & have to wear liners bc i leak so much laughing or coughing or sneezing i always have to have an extra pair of pants just in case if i have to go long distance or long period of time<br>  <br>  it realy depends on where the baby is & it is most likely right on top if ur bladder|`|3K7ffKn2aa	this baby might just be sitting on your bladder this time. your probably fine. Sometimes i'll go and b4 i finish pulling my clothes up i feel like i gotta go again.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Overreacting|`|a7pgX1W8aa	I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you aren't having any pain or have any foul smells. If you are having those things then you should go to the doctor, because you could have an infection. Maybe this baby implanted itself closer to your bladder area and that is why you are peeing more. In pregnancies after you first, your muscles are as tight as they were with your first, so the baby could be laying lower then in your first. In any matter don't worry so much, it is all normal. Besides once you get in the second trimester, you will get a little break on peeing so much, until you hit your third trimester. Your almost to your break time. Take care of yourself and don't worry. Hope this helps.|`|28QPS6V9aa	You know I had a cold last week and it made me pee so much, I'm 29 weeks pregnant and every time I coughed (which was constantly) it made me have to pee. I counted, and I went to the bathroom 12 times in one hour. I'm not kidding. I just couldn't hold it. Just thought I'd tell you that. I'm not sure why! :) Anyways, being pregnant makes you pee a lot and I've noticed with each pregnancy it gets worse. With my first I didn't go to the bathroom nearly as often. It's probably because having children causes your bladder to be weaker. Don't worry about it. It's completely normal. If you don't want to use the bathroom so much cut back a tad on the liquids.|`|4QEjQrHcaa	i didnt have to many bladder issues with my pregnancy peeing came normaly...you know everytime i coughed sneezed or laughed lol...but i did have an issue through my whole pregnancy i couldnt get rid of a bladder infection and ended up with gbs (not an std) they simply give u anti-biotics before the birth..you sound completly normal just get checed for a uti if your concerned|`|MPbB0ri1aa	That is more frequent than usual. I would be a good idea to call you doctor and report what is going on.<br>  <br>  It is possible to have a bladder infection with frequency, but no pain. It may not be one, but better safe than sorry, right?|`|kc26mQCBaa	if you aren't having pain, discomfort or your urine hasn't dramatically changed in color - you're fine. You can still mention it to your doctor on your next visit.
FLEXqVoiaa	Ahh yes, both my kids! Patrick has started standing on the back of the couch and jumping off lol-We don't let him, but he sneaks around and does it when we're not looking. And Jana can somehow climb out of her crib, even when the mattress is on the lowest setting. Sometimes I think when they're a llittle older, those two will find ways to do sneaky things and get hurt together, just to worry me!|`|AaoclPYCaa	Thank God babies are pretty durable!  I would just try to keep him on carpet or a softer area of your house.  There is really not to much you can do. You have to let him develop and mature.  If he hurts himself to much he will stop.  So just keep the doctor's office on speed dial and try to corral him the best you can.   Good luck|`|E5CnUdhsaa	right now my 14 month old daughter has a bruise on her fore head as she decided to sky dive into her toy box...i cant take my eyes off her for a second literally she even has to come to the bathroom with me (and she trys to climb in the tub) she was on the couch sitting beside me and just jamp off aiming for her toy tub...swear shell be the end of me lol|`|UXhFcHCHaa	well my little one isnt quite that old yet but at 5 months he tries to slide off of me onto the floor. ive had to catch him about 3 times already. he cant sit up alone so i dont know why he is doing it.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Yes mine is the same way. When I am holding him, he will try to leap out of my arms to play on the floor. He hit his head all the time too- it makes me so nervous!|`|x3fQP9viaa	Buy him a helmet or wrap in bubble wrap!  Either one will only build his confidence that he is a super hero and can do anything.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	LOL.... yes, my son has been a daredevil for a while know.  I swear I am going to have a heart attack one of these days!  <br>  <br>  My son is now always trying to climb everything with no idea how to get back down......ohhh... great fun.   <br>  <br>  I asked this question awhile back,  I was add the link, perhaps you may enjoy reading the extra answers. <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Alnx1PybWGq4v3eWwC4aiKbty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081211095743AAFz7sA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hockey mask...lol.... there are times I think investing in a helmet wouldn't be such a bad idea too!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I keep threatening to get my son a helmet. I can't keep his tray on his high chair because he grabs onto it and hangs. He pulled a glider over on himself last week and an end table over at my mom's house. The child even tries to climb up my legs. It's going to be a miracle if he makes it to 3yrs old without a broken bone or stitches.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Oh gosh, yes!<br>  <br>  Just the other day Noah was pushing his lion push toy along the side of the coffee table and he stopped, put one foot on the seat of the toy, and looked like he was going to stand on the toy! I was like "What do you think you're doing!?"<br>  <br>  He's got a few bruises on his poor little head, too, from pulling up and crawling. Unfortunately, though, I think it's just going to have to happen. Bumps and bruises are part of life!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	unfortunately i think they all are; dd doesn't seem to get that smacking her face/head into something isn't a good idea until after she does it; i usually catch her in the act and save her, but she' getting faster and faster; and it's almost as if she knows she has split sec before i turn around and that's when she goes for it...arghh|`|207dFmdHaa	I have six kids, my youngest are 4 year old triplets. 2 girls and a boy...one of the little girls has absolutely no fear of anything. She will try anything, and the things she fiqures out to do are unreal. She was in the ER 3 times in one month last year....I thought they were going to report me as an abusive mother.  There is no stopping them, I as her father and brothers, have talked to her about being careful and not hurting herself, but she is unstoppable.  Good luck.....hope you have good insurance|`|lGcpXteaaa	Ugh yes!<br>  She just has no fear and it bugs me because we cant put them in bubble wrap right?<br>  She has just started taking her first steps this past week, and shes still not totally balanced. She just goes for it while im screaming in shock while i am doing the dishes!! lol! She tries to jump off the sofa, climb up the safety gate. Shes so forward too so its all the time!<br>  <br>  Sadly there is not a lot you can do, just to let him get his bumps and bruises while he perfects his balancing etc...Its hard i know!<br>  <br>  x
21LiTNVsaa	Hi! I am due one day before you, I was closed and thick at my 36 week appointment, and what i did was use my exercise ball and just standing and did some hip movement exercises to try to get his head going against my cervix, and when i went in for 37 weeks on friday, i was 50% effaced, so i think maybe it did some good. I think i lost my mucous plug yesterday too, so i would try that, sex for me is not worth it, just so uncomfortable! But I have also been trying to get some walking in everyday because I stay at home and dont do anything. I hope this helps!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Walk a lot!|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	You still have time.  They told us in labor class that is can change quickly just over night.  My doctor doesn't even check until 38 weeks unless you have a lot of contractions (more then 4 an hour).  Your going to have to do some walking.|`|6OeCeLv6aa	If you are only 37.3 weeks pregnant, it is not unusual for your cervix to be thick, especially if it is your first pregnancy. Some first time mom's early labor force is directed on the thinning of the cervix, with dilitation coming in active labor. Your doctor must have a medical reason to schedule an induction prior to your due date ie, large baby, gestational diabetes, high BP etc. My advice: don't worry & relax. Practice relaxation techniques for the big day. The more tense you are, the longer and harder it will be for you.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	walk, walk, walk, sorry say from all my readings the only two suggestions they give for self induction is sex and walking. since you said your hubby is out of town sounds like walking is your only option. i know when i walk i get major contractions!<br>  Good Luck!
rjVALevtaa	You can pretty much eat whatever you want. The only foods you should really stay away from are soft cheeses (like feta) and certain seafood particularly soft bodied fish (fish without scales). <br>  <br>  You don't need to avoid bathtubs. Just don't take an extremely hot bath. Same goes for spas. <br>  <br>  If you're sick you need to ask your doctor what medication is safe to take now that you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you buy a pregnancy book. I loved "Your Pregnancy Week by Week". It's an awesome book and it has pictures of what your baby looks like in the first and second trimester. It should answer all of your questions. It was extremely helpful to me during my first pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Congrats and best of luck! :)|`|d6dzoHvvaa	Yes it is okay to eat the same foods while pregnant and the reason they don't like you taking baths is because it raises your boby temp. and trust me i feel like i eat like a pig, i am constantly snacking on something and as soon as i am done with lunch i am thinking about what i'm going to have for dinner. Congrats!|`|AA10300476	First, congratulations to you. Your body is going to go through some amazing changes and no one can really tell you what they are going to be because every woman and every pregnancy is different. However, being constantly hungry is normal. As for food, don't eat certain fish that are high in mercury, like shark, swordfish, white albacore tuna and I just recently read that you shouldn't eat deli meat unless it has been heated thoroughly. Also, don't eat soft cheese or anything with unpasteurized milk. There are very few medicines you can take during the first trimester, but my doctor told me I could take Tylenol Cold and Sinus and Sudafed. Robitussin for coughs is safe and Tylenol is safe for pain, though it does absolutely nothing for me. As for baths, they're fine as long as the water isn't too hot because your body temperature doesn't need to get too high. Make sure you write down your questions and ask your OB at your first visit. Good luck!
piDDZ6Ywaa	Aw!! Okay, the reason why your falling in love with her, or think you are, is because she makes you feel wanted, and loved. Makes you feel needed, and we all want that don't we babes? Anyhow, you have to try to understand that lt's illegal to have a relationship with her, and the fact that she will be jeopardizing her relationships between her family & your family will basically go NUTS! She's emailing you because obviously she'd like to help you. And this isn't your fault. I think lt's great to get to email each-other, and that's fine. But please, please do NOT tell her how you feel. What your experiencing (Yes people, l know she's a bisexual!)is normal between you and her. If you keep feeling for her, you may need to try to stop emailing her for a while. lt's hard, l know, but what other choice do you have? Your experiencing in my opinion, as your okay 15. Be happy, & try to love everything around you, including your parents, too. Hope this helped and have a great night x x x|`|uZTLlAH9aa	I'm probably not of help, because I've never had a crush on another girl...<br>  <br>  BUT.<br>  <br>  It is probably just a crush.

Hold your head up high and concentrate on things that you usually do with your life.<br>  <br>  I think it's that kind of love, you know when you love your mum and friends. Its that love where you just love being around them and can't resist them. Its hard to explain.<br>  <br>  I think its just part of growing up, you know with all the hormones and stuff. It just mixes all your emotions and feeling of whom other people.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	There is a big problem.  Because, You apparently(from what you wrote) have had feelings for a teacher before.  Also, Both male and, female teachers.<br>  <br>  You need to see a therapist.  Because a pattern of, you having a crush on a teacher, is developing.
lN0GkKgaaa	I am still nursing my daughter who is 2 1/2 years old. =>|`|AA10300476	I breastfed my daughter until she was 15 months old. I had originally said I'd do 6 months. Then I decided to do the year that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends. When she turned one, she wouldn't drink regular milk and because I was worried about her not getting enough calcium, I kept nursing. When I took her for her dr's appointment, I mentioned to him that I was ready to stop and he gave me advice on how to do it and what to feed her so she'd get enough calcium. She loved yogurt and broccoli, so that helped. I plan to breastfeed this baby, too, but I doubt that I'll do it for as long and I worry about being as successful at it because I have a different job and I don't think I'll be able to feed him/her as often as I did my daughter.|`|iFAlZfVMaa	my first didn't like breastfeeding... it was too hot, too slow and she couldn't see what was going on in the room (nosy little bugger).. she stopped at 3 days and wouldn't eat!   <br>  the 2nd weaned herself at 8 mos and the last went cold turkey at 14 months because I was put on medication that ws able to be passed thru breastmilk...<br>  <br>  do what feels the best for you and baby... everyone is different...|`|28QPS6V9aa	I stopped at two months because she wasn't gaining weight.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	12 months old, she didnt want to nurse anymore and I wasnt going to force her|`|hGNvbC6oaa	My son is 19 months and still nursing.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	4 months.

There are plenty of moms who never breastfed and their kids are just fine.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I'm a formula feeder but not exactly by choice.<br>  <br>  I don't know how young your baby is, I assume that she is quite young.  If you want to continue breastfeeding, I would avoid supplementing.  It's easy to start, not that easy to stop and it can screw things up to a point where breastfeeding is no longer an option without extreme measures.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ive always used both and had very content babies with no problems|`|AA10624857	How old is your baby? If she is a newborn (less than 2 months old) it would not be unusual for her to want to eat every 1-2 hours around the clock. When you count feedings, you start with when the feeding starts until the next feeding starts. So, if your little one begins her nursing at 10 AM and it takes her 20-30 minutes to finish eating, it wouldn't be out of line for her to want to eat again even as soon as 11 AM. As she gets bigger she will be able to more easily go 2-3 hours between feedings. If your baby is going through a growth spurt than it also would not be unusual for her to want to nurse every hour or so. However, with that being said, it is possible and many moms do so successfully, to offer a formula bottle while also breast feeding. This is best introduced, thought after 6-8 weeks because it takes that long for breast milk production to be well established. If you plan to continue breast feeding than you are better off sticking with nursing her on demand and skipping the formula. Some babies do fine with a combination of breast milk and formula, but others find that drinking from a bottle is so much easier than sucking from a breast so they begin to refuse the breast in favor of the bottle. My guess is that your baby is quite young, probably younger than 8 weeks and she is still working with your body to produce the milk supply that is best for her needs. It is rare for a mother's milk not to meet the demands of her baby's needs.|`|FmC1TGm5aa	Totally normal - your baby is probably going through a growth spurt. Mine is 4.5 months old and has for what seems like WEEKS!!! :) She eats every hour during the day! Anyway, it's totally normal, and the more your baby nurses, the more milk your body will produce. So it's great if you think of it that way- your body will have even more milk tomorrow, and eventually she will eat less often because she will be receiving more each time she eats. Make sense? <br>  <br>  I used to get really worried about my supply, too, so I completely understand where you're coming from. But supplementing formula won't help - in fact it will create real problems with your supply. If you supplement, that's like telling your body that you it doesn't need to produce as much milk for your daughter. So it won't. Supplementing one bottle a day won't hurt at all, and it will ensure that your baby doesn't refuse to take the bottle later (mine is having this problem now and it's really bad). But I would avoid giving her any more than that. <br>  <br>  Overall, try not to worry, and be proud of yourself for being such a great mommy by giving your daughter an amazing gift: breastmilk.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Your milk is perfect. Your milk is always perfect.<br>  <br>  There are certainly occassional situations where, for a variety of reasons (practical needs or insufficient milk production) a nursing baby needs to be supplemented with formula. But before going that route, I would be sure that it IS really necessary.  Babies nurse often for many reasons ... and lack of milk/poor quality milk isn't usually the issue. <br>  <br>  How old is she?  (It's best to avoid bottles completely in babies much younger than 4-6 weeks, and such babies DO tend to nurse very often anyway.)<br>  <br>  How are her diapers? (At least 6  wet ones a day?)<br>  <br>  Her wieght gain? (If she's 2 weeks, she should be back to her birthweight, or close to it.  If older, she should be averaging at least a pound a month.)<br>  <br>  Her general development? (Meeting her milestones?)<br>  <br>  Her temperment?  (Is she generally happy?)<br>  <br>  Her nursing? (Can you see milk in her mouth? Hear/see her swallowing? Are you excessively sore? [can suggest poor/ineffective latch]. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned about your supply or anything else, speak with a lactation consultant.|`|rjVALevtaa	If your baby is wetting enough diapers and having regular bowel movements, I see no reason to add formula to her diet. If she wasn't getting enough to eat, she would let you know. <br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that giving your baby formula will cause a decrease in your milk supply.<br>  <br>  Every 40 minutes does seem excessive. I don't know, maybe you should discuss this with your doctor before you do anything.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	It sounds like your daughter is going through a growth spurt which is normal for her age, and explains the increased feedings. You'll find cluster feeds like this will crop up now and then.<br>  <br>  Your daughter is just fine and does not need supplementation (unless you want to, which is different from needing to). It sounds like your friend is caring and trying to be helpful, but what you're experiencing is normal and has nothing to do with your breast milk.<br>  <br>  By the way, there's nothing wrong with deciding to supplement with formula once in a while because you need a break or need for your own milk to replenish. I had to on occasion because pumping and me were not friends!|`|NAzAmFDnaa	For the first 4 weeks or so after having my son, I put him to breast every 30-40min.  He would nurse for comfort as much as for food.  Since he was so little and new at nursing, I think he needed to nurse frequently to get enough.  If you give formula, you may sabotage your breastfeeding by reducing your supply and getting your baby used to a rubber nipple.  Let your baby nurse as often as she wants to, the older she gets the longer she'll go between feedings.  I know it will seem like you are nursing 24hrs per day, but I think in the beginning, that is what nature intended.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	It is very normal for newborns to feed that often, it in no way means your milk is not enough for her.  If nursing on demand there is absolutely no need for formula.  See this link:<br>  <br>  "Just one bottle won't hurt - or will it?" about adding formula to an exclusively breastfed baby.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/bf/supplement.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/b...</a>|`|HXfHkoSHaa	How old is your baby.  Perhaps she can also have solids now.<br>  <br>  ETA:  at 8 weeks, she's not ready for solids, but perhaps she's going thru a growth spurt.  There's nothing wrong with supplementing, if it has to be done.  But try to wait a few days and see if things go back to normal.|`|AA10747002	Get a breast pump and ask your doctor how often and how many ounces she should be eating. This way you can measure the correct amount and get her on a schedule.|`|TBNaPkl6aa	Quit listening to your friend and talk with a lactation consultant.  She will tell you that a breastfed baby eating every 40 minutes is normal.  (How "fatty" your milk is has nothing to do with how often your baby eats!) Is your daughter wetting a few diapers a day?  Then she's getting enough.  If her poop is a yellowish color, then that shows she's getting enough of the rich fatty hindmilk that babies get at the end of a breastfed session.<br>  <br>  Supplementing with formula is not evil, but it might somewhat compromise your milk supply if you really want to breastfeed only.  You understand that breastfeeding works on a supply and demand basis, and that the milk is thin and very easily digestible.  This is why your baby eats so often.  The extreme frequency of eating won't last forever (a couple months at most), especially once your daughter's stomach matures a little more.<br>  <br>  One of the other surest ways to compromise intentions of exclusively breastfeeding is to listen to the opinions of people who have not breastfed and/or those who can't give you professional support about breastfeeding.  There is nothing wrong with talking with a friend about it if you're frustrated, but be careful and take advice and opinions from people who actually know about breastfeeding.  You'll find that good information and good support will help you to continue.  Good luck!|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	Honestly, I think there is WAY too much pressure put on new moms in regards to breastfeeding. In my opinion, the way you choose to feed your baby is a personal decision that everyone else should respect and stay out of. Breast feeding is wonderful, but it isn't for everyone. For breastfeeding to be ideal the mother has to eat a healthy balanced diet. That is harder than you think. It doesn't mean drinking a glass of orange juice with you pop tart and substituting a subway sandwich for your big mac. Also, many babies have food allergies (mine included). In my case I have my own food allergies to deal with. If I breastfed my sons I would have had to remove milk from my diet that is already void of wheat, rye, barley, and oats. I would have had to potentially remove other foods that cause breast feeding problems like onions, garlic, and spices from my diet as well, while still trying to eat a healthy balanced diet. I chose to take the formula route. My sons are both in the 95% for height and 75% for weight, my 2 year old knows his alphabet, can count to 20, and can do some basic reading, neither of my children had even a cold in the first six months of life, I have a strong healthy bond with both my children and I was back in my old clothes by the time I was 3 months postpartum with both of them. The popular way of thinking is that your child will be sickly, small, stupid, and maladjusted if you formula feed, but I'm hear to say they won't. If breastfeeding works for you than that's great! Its a fantastic thing to do for your child. However if it doesn't don't think that formula feeding is the sign of a failed motherhood. It isn't.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	I agree that breast is best. There's no doubt to that.<br>  <br>  However, formula is not a necessary evil. You aren't dooming your child to die if you give her formula. If she needs to be supplemented, then by all means do it! Just be sure to continue pumping, or your will eventually ease your supply.<br>  <br>  Breastfed babies naturally eat more often. Especially at the beginning, it's pretty normal for a baby to eat more.<br>  <br>  It could be that she's not latching properly and working too hard for not enough milk. It could be that you need to up your calories and get more milk. Or it could be a growth spurt.<br>  <br>  That being said, talk to your pediatrician before doing anything.|`|Si9hhcW1aa	You really should stick with one or the other and not mix the two. Depending on how old she is, you could start her on some cereal (kind of like oatmeal), but she would need to be at least 6 months old before starting her on cereal and it is not recommended by doctors, but I did it with my 3 kids to help them sleep through the night. Eating every 40 minutes is not uncommon when babies are really young. As she gets older the feedings will be less frequent. You could also use a breast pump to help out if needed. You should also talk to the pediatrician about it.|`|67FH2HoMaa	FORMULA IS NOT BAD. Obviously breast milk is the best way to go,  but if you have to supplement than don't feel bad. I used both with my son and he never had any problems he's just as smart and healthy as any other 8 month old baby. In fact he is in the 85th percentile for weight and he does not get sick all the time like everyone says, and he is also in daycare around other children all day long. Do not let people make you feel like giving your baby formula is wrong, it's not.|`|4Kf3GtBjaa	have to talked to her pediatrician, maybe he will be able to help you decide what is best for your baby.  breastfeeding is something that helps your baby grow strong, but sometimes when it is not possible to breastfeed, you can find most of the nutrients that breastmilk has in some formulas. ask a doctor and do what is best for your little one.|`|08GDBedGaa	breast feed every 10-15 mins inf she wants, then you can hopefully meeet her needs maybe a growth spurt!! i remember at one poiint my daughter being on my boobs all day literakly she was only off to have a burp, it wont last, look for signs of satifaction, falling asleep, swallowing sound, then you know you actually suppling milk!! if you start giving her formula and she's not on your boobs for 3-4 hous at a time and do this everyday, your supply will drop down!! when they have growth spurts they need a bit more so there telling your body, to supply what they need, :)|`|ddP3klT3aa	My baby was on formula and breast milk. Now he is on formula. He is very healthy. He has only had one ear infection..that was his only sickness. No vomiting, no diarrhea, little spit up, etc. He is a very happy baby. If your baby is hungry feed her. Give her some formula.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i had to do both...i didnt make enough milk to keep up with my baby's demands so i would give breastmilk when i could and use formula the rest of the time. my baby got fed, thats all that matters to me.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	sometimes women don't produce enough milk for the baby. breastfeeding is great but talk to your doc and if it's not working try pumping as much as you can and supplement the rest with formula|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I supplemented, I did breast milk and formula and it worked out great.|`|hIzQyflqaa	i had to give my son hungry baby formula aswell as breast milk as he was not satisfied, it takes alot of pressure and stress off mum too!|`|ME62Mtv4aa	well how old is she? Maybe she needs a little cereal added to her diet but only if she is at least 4-5 months I would say.|`|GoOZEKOxaa	I agree with Blondie only because my sister has been doing the same thing with her baby also...it seems to be working well|`|7Suz37Wiaa	no|`|9ro8fiKvaa	This is very common for new parents to worry about. The best way to find out if your baby is getting enough from breastfeeding is simply by his/her weight gain. If your child is gaining weight as your Dr thinks he/she should then you're doing just fine. In this case, your body will produce what your baby needs. If breasfeeding is causing your baby to gain a healthy amount of weight then, again, your Dr will advise you on this. There is nothing wrong with a formula fed child of that is the only choice that you have. If you want to breastfeed and it's going well, keep on doing it! Good luck and talk to your Dr!|`|ZR7Fgerlaa	Well, with my first, I failed miserably at nursing, so I bought a pump and pumped for about 9 weeks.  Then I got tired of that and gave him formula.  He's fine, he didn't smell like a formula baby, and he isn't sick all the time.  He got the colostrum, and that's the most important thing.  With our second, he's 4 months old and still nurses or bottlefeeds, but breastmilk only.  He refuses to take formula now; we supplemented til my milk came in and now that's all he wants.  Are you fully emptying your breasts when you nurse?  A good way to tell is if your breast feels very soft after a feeing.  It should still feel "full".  In any case, I would let the baby nurse, pump whatever is left, and feed it to her in a bottle.  Chances are she's not getting the hindmilk, and that's what has all the fatty stuff in it to help her grow.  The foremilk has nutrients in it, but is clearer and mostly for hydration.  How long is she feeding at each breast?  If it's only 10 minutes, that's not nearly long enough.  Go for 20 on each.  Or you could just switch her to pumping completely, with a few nursing sessions so she doesn't forget how to in case you're out and run out of milk.  BUT I would go to your doctor and ask his/her opinion.  I personally don't believe that some women can't produce enough milk; it's a supply and demand system.  And if you're not emtpying your breasts, it's not signalling to your body to produce more.|`|deIzFnV8aa	I would mainly make sure she really _is_ hungry every 40 minutes.  Its easy to mistake other fussing for hungryness.  Our DD always rooted when she had gas pains, for some reason. Maybe because sucking helps comfort babies and trigger teh BM reflex.  Babies _love_ to suck.  Try giving her a toy, finger or pacifier next time she roots and has just eaten, and see if it calms her down.<br>  <br>  Also make sure she really eats when she is eating.  She might be getting too distracted and not really nursing the whole time. Also, if you switch breasts before she empties one, she might be missing out on the hindmilk.  That is the creamiest, fattiest part of your milk, and its right at the end.  Let her go at least 10 minutes on a side before switching, and if she is still swallowing on the first breast, let her continue there.  This might help her feel more full.<br>  <br>  You could consider asking a lactation consultant for additional advice. Most pediatrician offices have one or several nurses who are also LC, and who you can talk to over the phone.  They would be able to tell you if they think formula would help as well.|`|hzKiegu8aa	Well I know someone who had the same problem and they did a 15 min breast feed and then while they were still hungry would switch to a formula. She also had a breast pump and would pump her own milk and add formula to the breast milk and feed it in a bottle to the baby and that stopped the hungry.<br>  <br>  You can try?|`|APh0sGTTaa	You gotta give her breastmilk. Nature has successfully created and done a great many things and we have to trust it as the smarter and more experienced one. Nature created the baby, let it create what goes into it. Alot of newborn babies are just really really hungry. Some cry, some sleep, some eat. No worries.|`|Ls9opE2aaa	8 weeks is hard.  Keep in mind she really doesn't need more than a few ounces of milk at this stage.  I had to do both because even with fenugreek supplements and pumping every HOUR (mucho inconvenient with my c-section scar and a 2 yr. old), I still never produced much milk. It was like that with my older son as well. If you're going to combine b.m. and formula, make sure you've got a good milk supply because it WILL go down some.  <br>  <br>  Start by nursing baby and give her 5 or 10 mins. to feel full, rock her or dance around so she's not fussy (or try a pacifier...she may just want to suck.) If she's still acting hungry, give only 1 or 2 ounces of formula...she may just need a top off.  Also, try nursing more frequently...that'll help keep up your milk supply. Pump regularly, even if you don't get anything, because it will also keep your supply up. <br>  <br>  Ask your doc. or a lactation consultant about herbal supplements such as mothers tea or fenugreek.  Call your local La Leche group and they'll probably be more helpful than your ped. If you qualify, they may even do home visits or offer free personal consultations...just ask for help...it's there..and if you can't continue nursing only, don't be discouraged or feel like you're lacking. <br>  <br>  My 1st son nursed only 4 mos., and my second son about 2 1/2 and they're both thriving and healthy. Moms put too much pressure on themselves. Keep calm and do what feels right.|`|PFfABk30aa	I would say from what i can remember that she's taking the milk as often as she's suppose to but I may be a little off. My son wasn't getting full when I was breast feeding (or attempting to anyways), but my son always seemed hungry (as your daughter), and would continue to cry after feeding as if he was still hungry. I had a hard time making barely enough milk for him to survive as it was. I started to notice within a week of him being born that feeding him was becoming harder and his not filling up problem was getting worse. He also started sounding weird when he breathed. Now, when he was born they had done a c-section and even took him down the the neo-natal intensive care unit to monitor him because his breathing wasn't right. I found out he has "Laringal Maylasia" or something like that so that was his problem. The milk was going down the wrong tube straight into his lungs because his esphogas muscles weren't strong enough and the flap that keeps food from going into his lungs wasn't strong enough to do it's job. This is something he has now outgrown but at just 6 weeks old (when they finally believed me something was wrong and did some test), they told me to start adding some cereal to his bottle which meant that I had to pump or use formula to feed him. I had a manual pump at the time and wasn't getting enough out to feed him so i had to use formula. They say that the most crucial time for an infant to recieve breat milk is the first 6 weeks so you're covered if you decide to supplement with formula. You can add cereal to her bottles. They told me to ad 1 1/2 table spoons for each bottle. Well, that wasn't enough (you could still hear it making a funny sound that it had before indicating it was going to his lungs), so i kept raising it little by little until he finally stopped sounding like that. It ended up that for every scoop of formula I used, I was using the same amount of cereal (I used the formual scooper to measure it out). Now, of course your daughter may not need this much but I would just test it out with a little and raise it if you feel she needs it. It also helps them to sleep better and longer through the night since they are getting more they don't wake up as hungry or as often for milk. I would also like to add that I had no problem getting my son to switch from formula to milk when he was a year old like most pediatricians suggest. I do mean NO problem. I ran out of formula when he was 13 months old and started milk with the very next bottle. He took it fine and has never given me any grief about it. I hope i was helpful.|`|bxPaQzWLaa	I don't know how old your baby is so I am going in this a little blind...I will assume she is fairly young. I do know that some babies are "grazers" - they want to eat a little at a time frequently.  Of course you want to make sure your baby is getting enough to eat, that you are not having any problems with your milk, etc etc,  Having said that, it is okay to make your baby wait until it is time to eat.  Newborns can go a couple of hours to eat even though they may not think they can.  They can get into a habit of eating a little every few minutes..also they will learn the only way you soothe them is by feeding them.  Feed your baby as much as she will take, noting the time you START feeding her.  Then don't feed her again for about 2 hours from the START of when you fed her last.  You can attempt to soothe her oral needs with a pacifier, swaddling her for a nap, rocking, whatever you like in the mean time.  This may help her get out of this habit. When you feed them after they have waited a little bit, they are more willing to eat, and may nurse until they get the fatty hindmilk, which is more filling.  Remember, you are not withholding a meal, just making her wait a little bit until she is actually hungry.  Think about it like if they were a little older - you would not give a child snacks every half hour because they would not eat lunch right? Kind of the same <br>  <br>  A couple of my kids were this way.  It is hard not to feed them every time they cry but trust me you cannot keep up with this 40 minute feeding schedule - you will burn yourself out and then you won't be any good to anyone.  <br>  <br>  Aside from that, I have breastfed all my kids for 6 months.  I pumped but also supplemented with formula when I needed to.  We have not had any problems with any of them switching back and forth from bottle to breast or from mom's milk to formula.  Other people tell me their babies were not willing to do that...after 5 kids of my own, we never had a problem.  <br>  <br>  Be patient - breast feeding is kind of  hard...and you are constantly secondguessing yourself - how much is baby getting, is baby getting enough...and someone is always trying to tell you how you could be doing better if you only did "fill in the blank".  The bottom line is you have to do what works for you and your baby and your family unit.

Wo4Gxtduaa	usually 2-4 wks before delivery, but all women are different as are all pregnancies.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's impossible to say precisely when your baby will "drop" or descend into your pelvis, because every pregnancy is unique. If this is your first baby, this process, which is also called lightening, is likely to occur several weeks before labor begins, though it may happen later. For subsequent pregnancies, lightening often doesn't occur before labor starts.<br>  <br>  You may find that you feel a little different after your baby has dropped. Some pregnancy complaints may get worse, while others may improve. On the one hand, your baby will be taking up more room in your pelvis, so you'll probably find that you have to urinate even more often than before. You may get an uncomfortable feeling of pressure deep in your pelvis, feel increasing discomfort when you walk, and even begin to waddle a bit.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, with less pressure on your stomach, you'll be able to eat a little more without feeling uncomfortably full, and if you've been suffering from heartburn, you may get some relief. You'll probably find that breathing feels easier, too.<br>  <br>  While lightening isn't a predictor of when labor will start, it is a sign that your body's getting ready. It's normal to feel lightening up to four weeks before your due date. If you feel an increase in pelvic pressure or the sensation that your baby is "pushing down" before then, call your healthcare provider so she can evaluate you for preterm labor.|`|OIS808Qmaa	No, it just means your body is preparing for the baby to be born soon.  My daughter droppped at around 35 weeks also, and I delivered her at 41 1/2 weeks (after being induced)  I know the end of pregnancy is extremely difficult and you want it to be over, but the baby needs to be in there for as long as possible so the lungs can develop.  Hang in there!|`|H2ciLJoPaa	Hello, I'm in the same boat as you, 35 weeks and baby has dropped and is firmly engaged. I got excited thinking maybe it meant he wouldn't come late but everyone is right, it COULD mean baby is coming in 2-4 weeks (if it's your first pregnancy) but apparently the baby could still go overdue by 2 weeks. :( It's still exciting to know he's getting ready though!!!|`|21LiTNVsaa	it does not necessarily mean that, because your baby can be head down from 28 weeks and nothing can happen. it does mean that you may start to dilate now that the babys head is pressed against your cervix, but you are not yet ready to give birth so just hang in there for a few more weeks! good luck|`|NGinqXvuaa	I remember how intense everything felt when I was pregnant with my first. I'm on number five now, and that was ten years ago! *lol* Um, if I do indeed recall, I dropped about 2-2 1/2 weeks before my son was born. I also had pretty killer Braxton-Hicks contractions, don't worry--it's just your body doing it's job and preparing for that precious baby. Best of luck!|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Depends on how long it takes for you to dilate! Your in the clear at this point to have your baby as long as your doctor says you don't have any complications. Have you lost your mucus plug yet? once you lose that you will start to dilate!Then labor is just around the corner!!! Congrats i am very envious!|`|6ErVPePEaa	That means your baby is down in the birthing canal and getting ready to be born.your baby could be there for a little while since you have not started to dilate your baby could come on time or late. I was 5cm dilated for almost 2 months and my son was 4 days late. With my daughter I was 4cm for 1 month and she came a week early. It is all just a waiting game at this point|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	lol not neccesarily.  My tummy 'dropped' when I was around the same time as you, and my little boy was three days overdue!  Dropping really just means that they're 'locked' into place for delivery, it has nothing to do with them being born soon or on time.|`|ae5ydHPEaa	when the baby dropped it means that she is getting ready to come out. It doesn't honeslty indicate that your going to have her quite yet. Just means that she is getting ready for birth.|`|HkImCOSuaa	yes when the baby drops this mean she is taking her position to come out... congratulations.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Most women have there baby within 4wks of it dropping. My son dropped at 34wks and was born at 38. It's not for sure but it's a good sign.|`|xBW4saqgaa	Hey sweets. same here. im now 37 weeks and my baby has dropped as well. i guess we are nearing our time. i have been having contractions as well but since its my first baby i am still not sure about so much thats happening with my body. my lower abdomen feels so heavy, i hardly can walk. the minute i wake up im unable to get off the bed.
AA11138222	I think when someone knows a lot of people of a certain ethnicity with a certain name, they tend to think of it as associated with that ethnicity. Also, some names are from a certain language, like Pedro, or Juan, and so therefore people that speak that language, or come from a country that speaks that language are just more likely to use the name.<br>  Personally I don't tend to care what the origin of a name is, as long as I like the way it sounds and the meaning of it, I see no problem using it.|`|flWS1h7vaa	To me I dont think black or white names really matter as long as you like it and wont regret callin your kids that..to me we're all the same it doesnt matter we have the same color blood!! your right it really doesnt matter..Caleb Dean could fall under both!! I think Black names are beautiful I think Demertis is a black name but I love it.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I don't think names are color-oriented.  I don't get the fuss between black and white names.|`|OEMIkJTUaa	I don't understand why that matters at all. A name is a name no matter what race you are.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	I don't think there are names that should be categorized by Black or White names. It is true that some Blacks come up with there own unique combinations for names, but that's about it. The unique names can be hard for kids to write or even say because kids just want to be feel normal like anyone else. The unique names might make them feel different, then again they may like there name a lot, it just depends. Unfortunately, these unique names could cause problems on getting a job in future. Even though companies are not supposed to discriminate some do based on names. I have a unique name myself and when I was submitting my resume under that name I would not get job offers. It was not until I started using my nickname that I started getting job offers. A name is a name and the names you gave are just that and they are very nice names for kids. I would say just to give your child a name you like and maybe try to make sure it is not a name that could give them future problems. Sorry so wordy. Hope this helps.|`|xqo5ukQAaa	You should check out the book Freakanomics by Steven D. Levitt. He spends a whole chapter discussing the statistics behind different "black" and "white" names, as well as the most popular ones, and shows how they can, or cannot, affect the life of the person.|`|gkgPHzg4aa	It doesn't matter what you want to name your child and it also doesn't matter what color skin you are. So don't worry about that as long as you like the name.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i agree with jlo, i don't think it matters what color you are, but i've heard people  talk about white and black names also.

hKJIDdVqaa	here is some food for thought.....a female child actively involved with her biological father will generally fair off better than those who are not with their bio father.  They will be less sexually promiscuous and more well rounded.  This is providing the father is not a negative influence.  Children need both parents. I totally understand you Comfort level feeling violated.  Tell dad to give it a while before over night visits ensue.  It is best in this situation to go in with sugar rather than vinegar.  Going to court will only guarantee that dad gets equal joint custody.  Dad's do not lose rights to their children just because mom's feel they should.  A man will not lose right to his child unless he endangers that child.  Work with the dad privately.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Unless you have cause to believe that he will be abusive or neglectful with her, you need to figure out how to respect him as a parent in her life as much as you would like him to respect you as her parent.  You both have a valid place in her life.  And, men are just as capable of caring for a child as women are.  They may need a little bit of time to learn how, just like you learned over the course of your life, but they do have the ability to love and care for a child, even an infant.  And, your daughter has the right to have a full relationship with both parents, if both are willing and able.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Well be fair here. As a man, he doesn’t know the importance of mother/baby when you’re talking about a newborn. So don’t get upset about it, just try to explain that you’re still a new Mommy and aren’t quite ready for that. But on the flip side, I can tell you from my husband’s experience, that it’s VERY hard to try and be a father when the mother is looking over your shoulder and judging your every move. Taking notes about how to hold here but not there. I know it’s mother’s instinct, but this man IS your baby’s father and you’re going to have to let go, even if it is a newborn. But do so gradually so he can feel included and you can rest comfortably. <br>  <br>  Is there any chance you two could allow him to do a Daddy boot camp? I know it might sound silly but it could help you ease worries and it could help him feel more involved?<br>  <br>  Otherwise, do you have a third party that can play middle man? Allow him to be there with his baby “alone” but you have another trusted person there to “babysit”?<br>  <br>  Having had my own baby, I understand what you mean. But again, my husband has been on the other side of that. So if you two can find a way to compromise, I suggest trying to do so. Because you should be thankful he’s being a good Daddy that wants to be part of your baby’s life. And you two are in this together for the next lifetime. So working together now will only benefit your baby’s future!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	In my opinion, if you chose that man to be her father, then you need to let him be a father. Dads have to learn how to take care of their infants too. If you lived together, you'd have to leave the baby alone with Dad sometimes too, so it's no different if you leave the baby with Dad when you're *not* together. You're both parents here, let him share the responsibilities and the joys of parenting.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Would you feel so uncomfortable if you two were together? <br>  Likely not. <br>  The baby needs to bond and have a relationship with her father, be proud he is willing to do that much. Your relationship status with the father needs to not matter, you need to focus on her relationship with him. <br>  Go to court, establish custody and financial arrangements and understand in your situation you have to share your daughter and you can't always be around (you picked this situation for your life.)|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Go to court get custody/visitation and child support set up.|`|bspRfskYaa	Has he done something in the past to make you feel uncomfortable?  If not, it is only natural that a father wants to spend time with his daughter even if you are not together.<br>  I suppose you could try explaining that while she is really little you want her to be with you at night but, he may take this as an insult and get upset that you think that he can't take care of his own daughter.<br>  To be honest unless he has done something in the past that would enable you to get a court order to stop him seeing her alone, I don't know what else you can do.|`|jLYTKr33aa	With all due respect, it takes two to make a baby.  Like it or not, your daughter belongs just as much to her father as she does to you.  You shouldn't have had a child with him if you were uncomfortable with it, but what's done is done.  Unless you have a good reason to believe that he may be dangerous, it's pretty selfish to all who are involved to try to keep the father from having the same amount of time with your daughter as you do.  Either way, he can always go to court to get 50/50 custody of her, and trying to stop him for no real reason isn't going to help your case at all.  Be civil, be fair, and do what's right for your child - which is to have equal time with her father.|`|Kx9QgyjSaa	i agree with your instinct. under age 1 year the baby should be near you since you probably will be breastfeeding her the best possible food for an infant.  babes need to eat more often than every 10 hours.  the dad definitely should be spending time with baby and since he should be wanting his little girl to have the healthiest start in life should understand that as the grown up he'll just have to wait til she can be away from you longer for over night visits.  as long as he will be a good care giver he could have her for a couple hours while you shop or get your hair done or have coffee with a friend.  if you basically trust him but aren't sure of his parenting skills then does he have a mom or sister who you are comfortable with that would back him up?<br>  <br>  You two grown ups should be making decisions based on what is best for baby not what you want.  To cut dad out of kids life you'd better have some strong reason because it will harm your child.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Well, although you are not comfortable with doing this, your daughter is the product of both of you.  How would you feel if the roles were reversed and you could only see your daughter when he was there?  I have a friend who is going through a similar dilemma right now.  Her son is 8 months old now, but basically she had an oops with a guy she had a "casual" relationship with.  The guy loveeeees his son but she is very protective, and does not let them have much time alone.  I forsee this turning out much worse than she thinks because eventually the father is going to get fed up and ask for joint custody.  At that time, the court will most likely split visitation and he will be seeing his son much more than hes even asking for now.  Its great that the father wants your baby to be in his life and wants time to bond with her.  If you are on good terms with your ex, why not ask if he would mind coming over to spend time with her for say, the first 2 months?  I think that sounds very reasonable.  If hes a decent guy he should understand that, especially since in some cultures (which I agree with) the mother and baby must stay home for 40 days with exclusion of doctor appts. and necesities for health reasons.  But after your baby is settled in you will need to work out some kind of arrangement.  If you don't things can get ugly really fast.  Try to look at his point of view even though you are going to want to protect your baby and be with her all the time I'm sure.|`|tw1uePBbaa	if he is the child's father, why would you feel uncomfortable leaving her with him?  he is going to be her father and if he hasnt done anything to deserver you feeling like this, he has every right to have unsupervised visits with his daughter.<br>  <br>  why is it that people think that men are incapable of taking care of an infant on their own?  yes it is a tremdous responsability, but there isnt anything that makes a new mom more qualified.  my friend's wife died before they could even bring their little girl home from the hospital.  even in his great state of grief he managed caring for their newborn-BECAUSE IT WAS HIS CHILD TOO-and is a wonderful father.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well its really upto you. a new born i can understand but from 2 weeks theres nothing stopping you. i can understand how you feel as i went through it but you get used to it and eventually enjoy the 'time off' suggest visits with you present or taking baby out for the day. build trust with him and try to come to your own agreement. it is hard to leave your baby but dad deserves some quality time too without you present as your not together anymore. baby will handle it ok! my daughter has been going away every second weekend since 2 months old. if anything starting early helped as she was used to going 'away' better when shes suddenly having to adapt as opposed to breaking her into the routine:) do whats best for your baby.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	you really need to go to court and establish legal custody first but other than that he is her father too and she needs to bond with him just like she needs to bond with you. its not about you and him not being together, its about your baby and she deserves a close relationship with him.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Why would you be uncomfortable leaving her alone with him?|`|IWzYB44raa	Seems like he just wants a chance to bond with her.  I think it is good, and you should encourage him to spend time with her.  All little girls really need a good dad.  I would encourage him to be as big a part of her life as he can and to spend as much time together as possible.  It will help her to grow up healthy and feel loved.
ilZkHdKcaa	I am right there with you. First day of LMP was 25/01 ovulated 8/02 missed period 22/02. Tested yesterday and today twice both BFN!! So frustrating. Maybe we are not producing enough hcg yet. My temps are still high and boobs are very sore. So just maybe thers still a chance. Good Luck and baby dust to you!!!!!|`|txSiQc7Waa	It seems to be a reoccuring theme that women aren't getting their positives until later after their missed period. A hpt measures the amount of hcg in your urine. If your baby implanted later, then the hcg levels aren't going to be strong enough to detect it until later. So hang in there. Wait a few more days and then test again :) Good luck and baby dust to you!|`|fpZ014Uraa	well theres all types of reason a woman can miss a period for the month yes pregnancy is the most common but not always the answer you've seemed to had ruled that out and if your still curious i would see a doc for a blood test.<br>  <br>  Being Overweight<br>  Change in Schedules<br>  Change in Medications<br>  Illness<br>  Being Underweight<br>  Miscalculation<br>  Peri-Menopause<br>  Menopause<br>  Pregnancy<br>  stress|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I was 5 weeks late when I finally got my positive pregnancy test.

53GH38Qiaa	You cycle starts on the first day of your period. If you have a day of spotting before your period actually starts that is the last day of your last cycle. Don't count the first day until you are actually having your full period. If you did indeed start your period on the 26th then you should be expecting your period yesterday or today. So you can go ahead and take that prego test if period doesn't show up soon!!|`|QB5D0rG4aa	the first day of your period|`|fWAzJIEkaa	Hey!<br>  My period was 26th jan, and im on 28th day cycle.. and my period was due yesterday..and no show..so hopefully it stays away!<br>  U count it as from ur first day of bleeding..(26th)<br>  Hope it helps, and best of luck to u! xx|`|yp9rEMSraa	First day of your period....Best of Luck and baby dust

jNPCT96Xaa	Looks like you ovulated to me. I also looks as though you have shorter cycles (about 25 days) so you would ovulate around day 10 or 11 as it shows on your chart. You need to look for the drop then rise in temperature, not necessarily that your temperature is elevated. I don't ovulate and mine pretty much looks like a straight line.<br>  <br>  From my experience of being on Clomid, it was the only way i could conceive. It would encourage ovulation and after about 2-3 months, I would conceive. So I would have to agree that it does work for most people. Just don't be discouraged if it takes a few months as the dosage might need to be adjusted.<br>  <br>  But I would keep your head up and keep trying.|`|S1gJJHNzaa	lack of ovulation is one of the very best fertility issues, because drs can almost ALWAYS make you ovulate.<br>  <br>  I did 3 rounds of clomid.. my dr wasn't scanning me between rounds and i developed a 9cm cyst, so for that reason i would recommend getting scanned at the beginning to each cycle to be sure there are no cysts on your ovaries before taking the clomid again.. sometimes we do have very very tiny cysts and the clomid makes the huge!<br>  <br>  well the clomid alone didn't work for me so next cycle i start with clomid trigger and IUI, wish me luck and good luck to you!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Gosh, you are kidding me!  I was sure you were ovulating when I looked at your chart.  Mine fluctuated like that and I ended up getting pregnant.  Well, I am so sorry for giving false hope dear!  You'll get pregnant though dear!  I PROMISE!
miPubuDYaa	Both are possibly true.<br>  <br>  If the fetus hasn't implanted in the uteran wall and it dies you body will just absobe it. If you are very early in the pregnancy your body with expell and you will think its your period.<br>  <br>  If you know your pregnant and have a miscarriage, go to the hospital ASAP. The doctors will do another ulta sound to check if the fetus still has a heart beat and determine if the baby has died. If it has it will then expell on it own. If it doesn't within a certain time frame  you will be sceduled for a D&C.<br>  <br>  A D&C is a operation where they go in and remove all the dead tissue. Even though the procesure is the same as a abortion, in this case the fetus is already dead.|`|sstNdyYVaa	thats silly<br>  <br>  the baby comes out, or they clean it out!<br>  <br>  yes they give u an vaginal ultrasound to see if your insides are all clear!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Not true, when you miscarry you would have severe cramping and bleeding. It would get pretty bad right before the dead baby comes out. The baby would come out of your vagina and would probably look like a large blood clot or a tiny baby depending on how far along you are. <br>  <br>  You should go to the hospital or doctors if you think you're miscarrying anyway because they need to test your blood and give you an ultrasound to make sure everything is out your body.|`|HkImCOSuaa	They would give you an ultra sound and check if the babies heart beat is still there and if its not then they will give you some pills to get it all out thats left so it doesnt harm you.. Im sorry by the way.|`|JmXr1agRaa	a miscarriage is when you give birth to a dead baby before it is supposed to be born. whoever told you that is quite dumb, i hope their not planning on getting pregnant any time soon.|`|YLXpwqceaa	The baby doesn't dissolve.  It will come out with the bleeding and look like a blood clot.  You will have cramping and bleeding.  You should call your dr or go to ER if you feel you are miscarrying and have them check you out.|`|ae5ydHPEaa	If you think you had a miscarriage you must go to the doctors right away. In fact not going to the doctors and informing them about it could be very harmful to your body. It could possibly get you incredibly sick.<br>  <br>  See a doctor atleast.

MHMndoCcaa	Me and my Bf tried the same thing last year when i was 16..we tried forever...and i kept getting my period and i would get sooo sad...and yes i do want one still...and i am! Now, im 2 months...your not stupid, but many people will judge you...do what you want. Its just a phase we ago through. I wanted on so i could have something thats a part of my hunny and because i love him....and i want to show love to my own baby and im still gonna finish school...so this is my opinion, Good Luck.|`|7akG7iRPaa	honestly yea its a lil crazy  because you are only  16... plus are u sure you can take care of the baby,  does he want it? theres alot of things you have to look at and think over. and 5 months really isn't long enough to  even be thinking about that... live your life before you don't have a choice anymore.... i think you  should tough  it through the rest of school  and do some real serious thinking about the baby, i don't think its a good  idea....    but that's just my opinion|`|kjcybCOvaa	ps:your retarded to think of tht.and my best freind is 17 and has a daughter.|`|bWYZabSMaa	Oh my goodness honey. I was 19 when i had my first baby and I love him to death but wished I would have waited so I could go to college and get an education! (I will eventually just not right now) Sure everyone in high school doesnt particuarly like school but I think you should finish or just get your ged with out having a baby. Its not good for you or the child. Wouldn't you rather be able to provide for the baby? Babies are harder to take care of then teenagers think and I think you would regret it.|`|YIb23obFaa	i got pregnant about 4 months ago never felt good enough to go to school i ended up DROPPING OUT i thought i had a break but i had a miscarriage and now i regret how i stopped going to school i wish i would of stayed even though i hated it too. believe me you reaaally do want to go to school get a good job to pay for all that. what you think you can become financially ready with a GED????? come on. you need college you cant live at your parents house forever. btw im 16|`|OCk7I8JVaa	smart enough? i doubt it. why don't you just drop out of school and spare us the expense of another welfare baby.|`|fpZ014Uraa	yes very dumb you will screw up your life and your childs life and prob be one extra idiot i pay for with my taxes|`|LZoUTjE7aa	gamble|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I can already tell you LOTS of people are going to say no and finish school, wait till you are financially ready, etc. . . but in the end you are the one making the decisions and I know even if people tell you not to. . you probably will still go for it. . . Me, personally I wouldn't have a baby at the age of 16.  It's a lot harder then you'd think.|`|ETM57dBAaa	Honestly well at 16 I became pregnant, I was a rape victim!  I did drop out of school because of all the talk about who is the daddy.  Everyone knew I had a BF and we hadn't had sex.  At the time I was raped I also had lost my virginity!  I was raped by a random guy that a friend brought to my house for a get together.  he will tell you it wasn't rape I guess because I didn't scream and fight him I said no about 20 times, and was balling so to me it was RAPE! What a way to have it happen!  In the end I lost the baby and I think it was God's way of saying you are NOT ready for this very challenging world especially with a baby.  Now I sit back and think about it and know I was way to young!!  I am currently 28 with a 5 and 3 yr old and it is still hard!  i love it but it's hard for me a family of 5 with a good income! So with that said I think you should reconsider!!  I am sure you will do the right thing!!  Wait for it!  It will be amazing if done when the time is right!  God Bless!
7rCeCVl2aa	A lot of children have heads that don't seem to fit their body. I am sure genetics play a bit of a role but as your child gets older you'll notice his body catching up with his head.<br>  <br>  I like to think: Big Head = Big Brain  =)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	We did the head ultrasound too.  My husband also has a large head.  What they are looking for is Hydrocephalus or "water on the brain."  It's pretty rare, but if the head seems big they try to do the test while they can still do an ultrasound, before the skull has closed.  If they wait until after the skull has closed, they have to do a CT scan and the baby needs to be sedated for that.<br>  <br>  The ultrasound is unpleasant for the baby but not painful.  It doesn't take too long and chances are they'll just tell you that your baby has a big head.<br>  <br>  Bring a hat because they do put that gel on their head and there's no way to really get it out of their hair until you get home.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I know a boy who is 7 years old and his head is huge. When he was born it was in the 105%<br>  Probably still is too.<br>  But all that matters is health. A big head doesnt necessarily mean something is wrong.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My 20 month old and my 5 month old are both in the 94th Percentile.  Does the doctor think she has hydrocephalus?  If not, then she probably just fits a lot of brains in there like my boys.|`|HvALvdc7aa	My daughter was off the charts at her 2 month checkup last week. Her head is 16 inches. Of course I have a large cranium as well so Im guessing its normal. The Dr didn't seem to concerned.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	My son has a large head also. I would wait until the ultra sound.|`|6ILZs12laa	My daughter went in for her 2 month check up a couple of weeks ago and her head measured in the 93rd percentile.  I think if the doctor was concerned he would have said something...  I agree w/ the person that said  big head=big brain  :)|`|e9kvxIc3aa	That's all you can do then..Good luck to you.
claUGpVRaa	I'd say it's better to wait until after you are due. Wait about 3 days after if you can, then  a test is more likely to prove positive if you are because by that point there will be enough pregnancy hormones in your system. <br>  Sometimes if you test early there isn't enough levels of the hormones in your body to get a definite reason and that's when it can read negative even if you are pregnant.<br>  Good luck - hope you get the result you want.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	First Response claim you can test up to 6 days before you are due for your period, however this all depends on your hCG levels.<br>  <br>  Its best to wait until the day you miss a period, then re-test every 3 days after that (as that is when hCG will have doubled if it is present).|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can get an early detection pregnancy test and test I believe 5 days before your missed period. I tested when I was 3 weeks pregnant and it was extremely faint but positive! Good luck!|`|6PEOqeLOaa	you can take one 2 weeks before your missed period...make sure you buy the right ones. but most accurate is waiting; sometimes it doesn't always show right away (hormones in urine)|`|h8bzwBhKaa	you can take a test a week before you expect your period, as a pregnancy hormone can be detected by a test, but the line may be faint and then get darker as the days go on.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i tested positive 6 days before my period was due using first response 6 days sooner<br>  so they can work x x x|`|sstNdyYVaa	better to do it on the first day of missed period/expected period, results are much better and clearer!
txSiQc7Waa	If you've had that many positives, odds are that the doc's blood test is going to be positive too. Just wait to get the results back and try to relax! Good luck to you and tons of baby dust!|`|7BaHGMEyaa	if the doctors one comes back negative then just wait and see if you're period comes or if you get any symptoms of pregnancyy<br>  i wish you luck :)|`|uNRvZWifaa	just wait for you blood test results even urine tests from the doc offices can be wrong! the blood test will let you know for sure. GOOD LUCK|`|28QPS6V9aa	Some women have a chemical in their body that will always make a pregnancy test positive. (the home tests that is) I'm not sure what it's called exactly but you could have it. It's fairly common. My friend has it and every time she thinks she's pregnant she has to have the doctor test because home tests aren't accurate for her. If you really think you're pregnant ask for an ultrasound. That would be able to detect if you are pregnant or not.
em8A42Bqaa	Sounds like he wants to be a papa!  How old are ya'll?  If you both are ready and of age to settle down then go for it.<br>  <br>  I wasnt ready to have a baby, but my husband was, and so it took me awhile to  get used to the idea, but as my tummy continues to grow,  I know that she will be the highlight of my life.  Just make sure that you are both READY as far as settling down and raising your child!|`|ku5NPnkfaa	He wants you to be pregnant. You said he wants to marry you but your not ready so hes probably trying to get you pregnant so he can tye you down to him maybe hes scared of losing you.|`|ztzEloj5aa	why dont you just talk to him about it? he may want to be a daddy and he knows your on the pill- you should let him know your not ready to be a mom but when the time is right....|`|a6e7SRYzaa	It sounds to me like he really wants to be a daddy. If he was going to ask you to marry him then you guys must be of adult age.

Sounds kind of odd to me....|`|IWzYB44raa	It sounds like he is in love with you and wants to be with you forever.  It doesn't sound like he is trying to get you pregnant if he knows you're on the pill.  Seems like he just has wishful thinking and wants you to know he wouldn't mind at all if you did happen to get pregnant.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think he's trying to tell you that he would like to be a daddy and would probably like to start trying for a family with you. You need to talk to him about. Let him know how you feel about having a baby and talk to him about his feelings.
c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	Well, everyone's pregnancy is different. For example, my mom and sister all felt pain in their back, but I just felt pain in my lower stomach (like BAD menstrual cramps). My water didn't break until I was in the birthing room, but it feels like a pop! The contractions are absolutely awful and you can't feel the dilation.  I didn't want drugs, but I had been having contractions for a full two days before our baby came, so by the time I got to the birthing room I went ahead and got the drugs!! Why don't you want the drugs? It's not bad, and you feel the contractions, but they will feel like alot of pressure with no pain. I had an epi so I didn't feel too much when our little guy came out. But that being said, I would do the epi again, b/c I could enjoy having him without being in so much pain. Epi feels like a little pinch when they are putting it in and your lower body starts to go numb after a few minutes. I was scared about it until the pain hit. At that point I would have taken ANY thing!!! :-)  I don't have any bruising or pain (I've never heard about any of that) now and I had my son last year. And you won't be worried about Doctor "cleaning you up" b/c you will be sooo taken in with finally meeting the beautiful child you've been waiting for. I hope this helps! I don't mind telling anyone about the process, and I hope you will start to feel better about it :-)|`|UaL28atDaa	Im sorrry to say i cannot give you personal experience but I can give you a great website that explains each stage of pregnancy including childbirth. <br>  <br>  I think you will find it really useful, check it out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/browse/cid/15/sid/35/Labor_Delivery/Delivery_and_Childbirth?YAFT" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...</a>|`|6ErVPePEaa	Honestly I have no idea about natural birth. I had epidurals with both of my children. My mother had my older sister naturally and she said it was the worst pain ever in her life. I would suggest to you to at least consider the eppie. you don't feel yourself dilating although when the baby drops and you are fully dilated you have a serious need to push. Like you have to take a #2. Once the baby is pulled out you do not push out the placenta. At least I didn't. it just came out. It feels funny. Does not hurt. After the baby is born the nurses will rub on your belly. I dont know what it is like to push the baby out naturally but with the eppie, I just felt a lot of pressure, and some burning that was about it when pushing my son out....|`|W1p6LetFaa	I have not actually given birth yet, so I guess I am not going to be much good to actually answer your question.  But I just wanted to give you some encouragement and share some advice that has been shared with me.  <br>  <br>  The number one thing people tell me about labor is to be flexible.  It is perfectly alright to have a plan in mind (such as natural birth, no drugs), but you need to have a back up plan (and maybe even a back-up back up plan).  Labor never goes exactly the way you would like it (I would have liked to go into labor 3 weeks ago, but it doesn't always work that way).  If you go in there with your only option being "NO DRUGS," you might find yourself absolutely devastated if you either change your mind last minute and go for the epidural or if your baby ends up being breech and you require a C-section.  I'm not saying that any of these things WILL happen, but my point is that it is all beyond your control.  Have a plan set in place, but don't overlook your backup plan so you don't leave the hospital feeling like a failure!  Your ultimate "plan" needs to be to have a happy and healthy baby, not to have a natural, drug-free birth.  Sometimes that means compromise, and that doesn't make you a failure!  <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your little one!  Come find me in a week or two and I can give you more details about labor! :-)|`|AA10114746	To be honest the experience of other won't really help you in this situation. Everyone has a different experience and different things happen that may or may not even happen to you. I know women who said their contractions just felt like menstral cramping but for me it felt like I was being stabbed reapeatedly with my first son. I found that it is better not knowing about other experience because sometimes they can be traumatic or the person can be overdramatic and scare the hell out of you so my advise to you is to get you a few books on pregnacy and labor and prepare yourself the best way you can. Hope this helps you.|`|Bja35ZbUaa	I just gave birth to my first about a week ago, I was really really freaked out just like you.  When it started happening I was like I am not ready for this.  It isn't as bad as you think!  Don't freak your self out.  I had an epidural and it was heaven I couldn't feel a thing,  I know you said you ar going natural birth so I am not sure what that feels like.  The contractions at first feel like strong menstrual cramps and they are manageable cause they come and go.  They do get stronger and closer to together.  When you are pushing it just feels like you are trying to go to the bathroom only you are really pushing hard and when the baby comes out it feels like a really slippery thing coming out, the placenta is no big deal it just comes out after the baby.  I had stitches but couldn't feel anything cause I was numb.  It was the after part that was hard for me.  I still can't really walk sometimes cause it hurts down there ect..   It's not the most fun thing you will ever do but it's doable and there is no reason to freak out.  Hope some of this helps a little bit|`|Nux5S6oVaa	Congrats Mom-<br>      I'm 26 and due sept 25th with my first.  I'm an RN and I have seen 14yrs give birth and 40+ yr old give birth, each one was different.  I don't think anything can prepare you...my doctor recommends yoga and hypnobirthing...to help you stay calm.<br>  <br>  My doctor also talked to me about plans...Don't get so caught up in saying "No drugs for me" because you won't know how you are going to feel and the last thing you want is to feel like a failure...There are many options...I'm planning to have a healthy happy baby...whether that is with an epidural...demerol...nubain...water therapy...a tens unit. I want to be able to enjoy my newborn and not think about the pain or anything.<br>  <br>  Take a deep breath, everything will be find and over before you know it!|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Well I didn't have a 'no drug birth' but I will tell you what it was like for me...<br>  <br>  I was in labor for a grand total of 17.5 hours.  From beginning to end.  I had only the epidural-thankfully-since my son was 9 lbs. 9.2 oz. 22.5 inches long.  I'm not a big person, 5' 6" and 130 lbs., so this was phenominal for me lol.  I was able to push him out in 45 minutes.  My doc said that was record time-and not just because he was huge, but record time in general!  They turned off my epidural once I started pushing so that way the baby wasn't all drugged up, and I could get up and walk after he was born.  I ended up with some second degree tearing, borderline third degree, and I could feel them stitching me up, and honestly.  It wasn't that bad.  I was MUCH more focused on the 'prize' which was my little boy.  It was amazing.  I was terrified, and it all turned out okay.  It was amazing though, once I knew it was "showtime" I was the calm one, and my husband who is a Navy Corpsman (basically a medic) was the one that was looking like a deer in headlights! LOL  But he was an awesome coach. Always remember to breathe! lol<br>  <br>  Just take good care of yourself.  Eat healthy, go for walks now while your pregnant, and if you excercise, keep it up.  Take care of you, since that in turn will take care of your baby!  You'll be just fine hun, don't worry about things till it's time to worry about them.  Enjoy your pregnancy, and the miracle that it is.  Trust me....it's all amazing, the whole 10 months of pregnancy (since that's really how long you're pregnant for!) Is just amazing...I look forward to having another baby someday.  Not for a while yet lol, but someday.  If you need anything, feel free to add me to your friends list, I'll answer whatever I can for you!  Good luck, hang in there, and enjoy lifes greatest miracle!|`|h8bzwBhKaa	If you get bad period pains, then you can times them by at least 20, when i say bad i mean when you can't move until the pain killers have kicked in. First you may get back ache, like you do when your going to get you periods, but maybe a little sorer. Or you may get a show which can be jelly like, and sometimes have little blood in which i had.You might be getting contractions a bit like the br-hicks, if so time them. This doesn't mean that your going to go into full labour always, but in slow labour. Then your water could break, which is either like a trickle of warmness or in my case a pop in my tummy and no water came out as i had been in slow labour, and the babies head was blocking the way.You cant fell the dilation but the midwife will keep you updated. Remember to push out you bottom like your going to the toilet, don't get embarrassed if you make a mess it happens to everyone. All these things can happen in different orders for everyone, just remember the contractions are a good pain and everyone brings you closer to you having your baby.Good luck!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well i had to be induced because i was a week late.... what ended up happening with me was that i was going through labor, basically there is no REAL way to explain contractions. it hurts like hell, it's almost like someone is tearing apart your lower abdomen and screaming really helps (even though they say you should breath and not scream). anyway when you are ready to push you will know it and at that point the only thing you can do is push and it feels pretty good to push. no you can't feel it when you dilate, when your water breaks it just feels like a bucket of water is coming out of your vagina and you can't stop it. it just keeps coming.  <br>  as for the actually pushing the baby out and the clean up process i can't help you cause i had to have an emergency c section. <br>  i hope what i did share helps you. but don't hold on to any ones words too closely because every pregnancy, labor and delivery is completely different and what one person goes through the other person may have a very different experience. good luck<br>  and don't freak out about anything|`|g7gvzhkpaa	<a href="http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discovery-health/6891-birth-day-live-coleen-video.htm" rel="nofollow">http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discover...</a><br>  <br>  it`s different for everyone someone at your hospital should be able to answer your questions .

G2auAv1Saa	Yes. Having sex may cause pregnancy.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Well, the reason you'd use a condom is to help prevent pregnancy. You could be pregnant. Who knows. Only you will be able to find out.

If you are over 18 you don't need a prescription, just walk up to the pharmacy counter.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, you can get pregnant if you had unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  No,  you are not *definitely*  pregnant, and nobody here can tell you if you are.  If your period is late, do a test.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	I doesn't mean that you're pregnant right away but there is a possibility|`|IdtzdpqGaa	why do you 14 year olds waste peoples time asking b s questions|`|9l6MOZ8Paa	duh ur pregos|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You're not necessarily pregnant but of course its possible.  You need to take a test and I'm super curious why you're having sex if you didn't understand that without protection of birth control you can get pregnant.  Without condoms you can get STD's...thats what you really need to be worried about.|`|tvF86mRDaa	No not necessarily but if it was less than 72 hrs ago then get the morning after pill and make sure you get yourself on the pill or something more reliable. If its over 72 hours you need to take a test. <br>  I dont want to be horrible and make nasty comments as there's little point in that but please be so careful in future! One of my friends has had a termination of pregnancy and its a horrible thing to go through, not easy and definitely not fun! So make sure you're not running the risk of putting yourself through such a terrible ordeal!<br>  Good luck, I hope the test is negative!|`|uuHPneEcaa	YES!!! even if he didn't nut inside u, u can get pregnant from the pre nut. If ur late on ur period then take a test. There are some time when u can have unprotected sex and not get pregnant. but ur chances are more greater if u do have unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  how old are u anyways??<br>  cause if ur like 15 then u shouldn't be having sex if u have to ask a question like that... Think about that question one more time,|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Yes you are congrats!! we ran a Y!A blood test on you and it came back positive =) now we see that you have a $20 co-payment due at the time of service we accept all major credit cards and paypal as for the rest should we bill directly to you or your insurance provider? Now if you will go over to the left pippin will check you out and set up your next apointment|`|EXhVHMAlaa	Sex = Baby<br>  <br>  Any more questions?|`|WPI0Z47saa	Why do people ask these questions? You know the answer so why are you bothering everyone?|`|gYkQc8Lraa	NO YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT|`|NoMZibBnaa	yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|JmXr1agRaa	You may or may not be pregnant. Why wouldn't you get pregnant? If a guy jizzed inside of your vag.. then duh!!! the sperm is in there, it's going to try to get to your egg. I would try to find the morning after pill somewhere, that or wait a while and get a pregnancy test, or even go to the doctors...<br>  i hate to say it, but if you have to ask this question then you shouldn't be having sex. if you're not ready to take on the responsibility of what happens when having sex, or smart enough to take precautions to do your best to stop these things from happening, then you shouldn't be having sex. it's as simple as that. and by sex i mean all kinds of sex, blowjobs, eating out, hand jobs, fingering, anal.. all of it...<br>  also, by not wearing a condom you could also get/give an STD.... so, if I were you i would get tested right away.|`|s2Dv9NRGaa	that one chick is rele rude and no not nessecarily.  If he ejaculated inside of you there is like a 99.9% chance you could be but that is not always the case. If he pulled out then you would have a lower chance. but if you are sexually active you should get on birthcontrol. you dont have to wear the annoying condom. [altough it would be safer] and you dont have to have parents permission at a health department.|`|AA10300476	Yes, you definitely are. You're having a boy and you should name him Zultar He-Man Alcatraz Shabazz Akbar Jenkins. He'll weigh 11 pounds 15 oz, and you'll wait too long before going to the hospital and have to push him out without drugs. Congratulations!|`|ae5ydHPEaa	There is a HIGH chance you did.<br>  But it is not all the time you can get pregnant.<br>  Go to the doctors and they'll tell you if you are or not.<br>  and if you are and dont want it.<br>  they will give you some kind of pill to exterminate it.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	yes you can and there could be a huge possibility that you can be. it depends on ur last cycle and when u had sex. wait 2wks after when ur next period is due and take a test. if ur not, next boo, dont take the risk:)|`|28QPS6V9aa	OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Take a freaken test! Seriously, how many times are people gonna ask this retarded question. Sex makes babies. Do you need me to explain the "birds and the bee" to you?|`|IH0kLuwZaa	yes you COULD be pregnant but their is no way to tell for sure until like two weeks good luck and i hope the results are what you want|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	yes.. now go cry.<br>  <br>  if you have to ask this question you shouldn't be having sex.|`|NOasjhX6aa	oh god! haha<br>  <br>  that sure is were babies come from<br>  <br>  go to your doctor & have a test done love!
xRZ1PRZwaa	Making strange is so normal. You have a bright and aware daughter there my dear!<br>  <br>  The only thing we can do as parents is to be aware, warn people so that they don't internalize the reaction, and be tender and compassionate for our little one. Our son makes strange, and we keep him in our arms, introduce calmly with sweet voices, and if the lip quivers, we move him away for a bit. It's a seriously stressful problem for babies.<br>  <br>  We'll then take our time and sit closer and closer to the 'stranger' over a period of moments. It takes time, but it works well. <br>  <br>  Funny, though, that same baby will see someone different and be just fine. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. Silly babies!<br>  <br>  You might also find with this stage that your daughter starts to cry when you leave the room or she can't see you as well. It's all part and parcel of 'discovering' others; it's a very tender little stage of development between 7 and 10 months.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, good luck hon!|`|ddP3klT3aa	You need to talk to her doctor and let him check her out.
hKJIDdVqaa	family court will donate you a lawyer if you cannot afford one. usually at age 11 a child can legal decide -BEFORE a judge whom they want to see and whom they do not want to see.  A cop cannot make that choice they only have to enforce the legal custody papers.  If there are no visitation court papers then she does not have to let him see the child.  If there are papers she has no choice. Especially if the dad has done nothing abusive or irregular to the child.  Child custody and visitaition is a tough one.  But yes contact family court or Dept of Social services to see about a court appointed attorney.  Fill out court papers and file for full custody. Theoretically your nephew should also have his own law guardian or his own lawyer that stands for his right and wishes.  Check into it.|`|grifjdr0aa	The kid has to go; it's bs, though.  I'm in contempt for not making my kid go, she's 16.  Luckily the loser meth head dad can't get it together enough to get an attorney.  She does, she needs a lawyer, badly.|`|7IHMjy2caa	Your sister should be able to go to any district attorney office and file a case as well as have an attorney appointed to her. <br>  <br>  Problem is, the child is still a little young to make the choice if he wants to see him. But a judge may still take his opinion into account. Has he said why he doesn't like going? If there is any concern about child abuse or neglect, your sister should immediately file a complaint with CPS.<br>  <br>  I am in the Houston area and can provide some low to no cost legal agencies. Send me a message if you would like them.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	your sister really needs to get a lawyer. about legal issues she may be entitled to some sort of legal aid but im not sure how it works over there. this is the exact situation i dread when my daughter gets olde so i cantimagine what you are all going through. best of luck to you and your family. all you can do is keep sending your nephew to his dads. it sucks i know and is completely heart breaking but soon in the eyes of the court he may be old enough to make up his own mind...in britain the age is 12 i beleive.|`|axR8BOdpaa	Your sister needs to get a lawyer and change the terms of visitation. In the mean time, the cops cannot force the boy to go. The boy's dad can file a contempt of court charge against her and they will go to court.<br>  No cop in their right mind would force a child to go with another parent, it would set them up to be sued.|`|jLYTKr33aa	Technically, your sister did interfere with custody.  If Dad has a visitation order, Mom has to see that Junior goes - even if he doesn't want to.  Sometimes you have to be tough and not let your children run rough shot over you - it's part of being a parent.  What would she do if he suddenly decided he didn't want to go to school - let him stay home and be truant?  I'm sorry that your nephew doesn't want to go to see his dad, but your sister has to woman up and make him go.|`|hVVALFAPaa	She probably needs a family attorney. There are lots of them in Texas (and elsewhere). You can usually find them online or through family services. <br>  <br>  I would also have her write down things her little boy says about 'bio dad.' Is there any good reason why the boy does not want to go? Or is he just uncomfortable/unfamiliar with the newness of bio-dad?<br>  <br>  Maybe they can work together to get the little boy more comfortable. Instead of a whole weekend, maybe a couple of hours at a time at the little boys' home. Then maybe a quick trip for ice cream or something (with mom) then later without mom. Work up slowly to an overnight visit. Poor little thing to be foisted on some stranger like that.

1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	It's like that plastic bag, but it's filled to the brim and constantly replenished with water ever 2 hours. PLUS it's being cushioned by your blood and your organs, making it a pretty nice place to be. <br>  <br>  Your baby is getting everything it needs - even if you're standing on your head.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	ur baby is fine and he/she is getting what it needs. ur uterus stretches as the baby grows and it will turn back to its normal size after the baby is born. when u lay a certain way the baby will let you know if he/she is uncomfortable or not. dont worry mom-to-be. the little one is fine:)|`|Si9hhcW1aa	The baby will be fine. The uterus is like a big sack filled with water. By laying on your side the only thing you will do is make the baby lay differently and some of your extremities might become numb or fall asleep. If that happens, then you just need to change positions. If you lay on your side it is most comfortable to place a pillow under your belly to help support it.|`|65tdfu0faa	Hi: Nothing to be concerened with there, woman have been having babies since the begining of time, and the goldfish in the plactic have only about 40 years....If there is ever a problem baby with get away from it by moving around, you know the feeling right...When you have any concerns like this consult at the very least, your public health office..Good luck with everything, but not to worry ..JT|`|HkImCOSuaa	nO you are not harming your baby.. it is ok relax just dont lay on your back at night.. and to be honest your baby is protected my lots of water and layers of skin the safest place is inside you r womb|`|Zdj6wmaiaa	Relax.  Your baby is going to be okay.  It doesn't matter how you sit or lay.
