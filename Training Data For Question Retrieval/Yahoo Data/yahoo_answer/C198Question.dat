20090225080732AA1M1DS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I use breastfeeding as an obsession trying to loose the pregnancy weight?	I have a serious problem. I have heard that breastfeeding helps with loosing the pregnancy weight. The weight is not coming off fast enough so I started pumping extra and saving it in the freezer.   Now the freezer is filled and my husband asked why I pump so much. I am embarrased because the weight isn't coming off still but it has become an obsession. Whenever I am not nursing I am pumping. I have just been dumping it down the drain so that my husband doesn't find out I have been pumping so much.   I pump about 8 hours a day and I also nurse constantly.   What can I do?
20090225080623AAKHyM8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	What do I do about my 8 year old thief?	My 8 year old daughter has been stealing for about 2 years now,I feel like I've tried everything to get her to stop and nothing is working.She steals from me,her dad,grandparents,teachers and kids at school,never any stores.She's stolen 3 cell phones,2digital cameras,an ipod,and jewelry from me and other family members.She's taken stamp sets,pens,stickers,and lots of toys from teachers and other kids at school.I've spanked her,explained to her what happens to people that steal,had a cop tell her she's going to jail if she keeps it up,taken her favorite toys away,thrown her toys in the trash and made her return as much as I could to the people she took it from.Alot of times I can't even get an honest answer about who these things belong to.I even took her to a psycologist which didn't help at all.Everytime it stops for a week or 2 then she shows up with something else that isn't hers.Most recently she came home from school with a Nintendo DS with 2 games and claimed she won it in art class.I'm out of ideas,I'm afraid she's gonna end up in jail before she'll quit.Can anyone help?

20090225081012AAA3njV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you know anyone who does this to their children?	Say, for example, you have a 4 year old who is not watching where he's going and he bumps into something.  Do you know anyone who fusses at them for this and tells them to watch where they are going?  Or, say, they drop something or knock a cup over and spill it.  The persons first response is, "what are you doing; you need to be more careful".  Know anyone like this???        This is an ongoing argument between myself and my husband.  He's always getting onto our oldest for accidents.  He isn't rude but I don't feel it's necessary.  We all have accidents.  When a child isn't paying attention and bumps their head on the wall, shouldn't your first response be, "omg, are you okay", not "watch where you're going"????????        I refuse to nag but my discussions w/ him are getting nowhere.  How can I handle this?.... Or, am I wrong here??

20090225081344AAXDuKl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do I deal with my domineering daughter?	My daughter is 15, a lovely girl and lots of fun to be around, but she's also very controlling. She sees herself as the head of household and won't take orders from anybody.      Her father is the same way. He's often away because he's in the army, but when he's around he uses very harsh discipline. I'm quite submissive and I find it difficult to set boundaries for her or stand up to her.      does anyone have any advice?
20090225081447AAlWCP1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Strange bumps on my 2 year olds face?	I have a almost 2 year old daughter. She was born with that baby acne and in 2 months it went away. She has had porcelain clear skin since then (other than stork bites on parts) but recently she is getting these pimple like bumps on her checks and forehead. They don't come to a head like a white or black head, they are just bumps and they dont last very long. Sometimes not even a day. They are not in a group, they are not hurting her, they are just red, semi large raised bumps. I noticed lately her cheeks are dry and I have been putting lotion on them. Aveeno hypo allergenic lotion. Is the lotion clogging the pores? or is it more of a dry skin issue? They are ALWAYS gone by morning and sometimes they only last a few hours and I wash her face every day. What could they be. I dont think they are pimples.
20090225081057AAHSB7t	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Scare of my life! Bleeding but not a miscarriage?	Last Saturday I had a big gush of red blood.   I panicked, I thought I was having a miscarriage.   On the way to the ER as I was crying, screaming and praying...   "I had no cramps or pains"   I went t the ER, there my blood had stopped.      After tests, ultrasounds on so on they told me I had a detached placenta and that I had to rest. If my placenta completely detaches, where there goes my baby, and I would have a real miscarriage.      What am I supposed to do at this moment?   Has anyone been through something like this or similar?   What can I and CAN NOT do?   Since that day I have been having a pain in my lower abdomen,   It does not feel like the uterus stretching or ligaments what can that be?

20090225081107AATDNtY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about getting Pregnant?	So I have an extremely out of whack menstrual cycle, 2 times a year. I went to different Dr. and everything is checking out normal there is not reason y I shouldn't be having my period. I go on progesterone and within a week I cycle.  Anyway, so I have heard u are most likely to get pregnant 10 days b4 u start ur period. Well I didn't know I was going to start my period (its completely random) and I had sex 3 days b4 I started and another time or two b4 that.  Also I tested yesterday b4 I started,  since I am irregular I always make sure that Im not, and it was negative. I was wondering if there was a possibility I could still b pregnant even if I am on my period n the test came out negative? I have also been extremely dizzy lately with no prior history of anemia which is prolly irrelevant but I thought I mention it.

20090225082545AAqn3Ou	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do I stop a girl I babysit from saying "Oh my God"?	I babysit a 6 year old girl, and she is constantly saying "Oh my God".  Her first language is French so I know she doesn't really understand what she is saying, and I have no idea if they believe in God.        I come from a Christian family, so saying that is like saying a bad word.  "Do not take the lords name in vain".  Should I tell her not to say that around me but say something like "Oh my goodness"?  If I say what, I won't know what to say when she asks why.  And if she tells her parents that she isn't allowed to say that around me, I won't know what to say either!  I know to some it isn't a big deal, but I can't stand hearing it every 5 minutes!  Should I just leave it?  What should I do?

20090225082643AAT5MGg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you child's clothes fit according to age or do they run differently?	What I'm basically asking is if your child is small or big?   My son has always been a little pixie, except for his big hands and feet.  Right now he's 20 months old and still wearing 12-18 month clothes and his 18 months pants are STILL too big.  I bought shorts for him LAST year at Carter's that were 12-18 months and I tried them on him a few days ago and they STILL have like 3 fingers worth of room around the waist and were barely hanging onto his body.  I know I've got a little peanut, but how do the clothe sizes match up to your child?  Are they running pretty fluid with the age of your child?

20090225083527AATd9ly	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How to explain or should I explain?	My kids love bugs bunny. So I got them a dvd with some of the more classic cartoons.       One of the cartoons features book characters coming out at night and playing music and one of the book is about africa and you know back then things weren't so PC and the africans look like gorillas in the face.      My daughter was like MOM what are those ? I just smiled and said book characters, she took my explanation and smiled and kept watching the cartoon      NOW I don't want to have to explain to her about how blacks have been drawn in the past compared to now. ( when will be the right age to explain this ? )       My daughter takes EVERYTHING literally and sometimes we have to be careful how we explain things to her.       Should I explain it to her and and how would I do that on her level at 4yrs old  or should I wait til she's older ?
20090225082639AAeZWAd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	If I am a week and three days late...?	With one negative Home pregnancy test, could that mean that I am still pregnant, it just isn't showing up? My boyfriend and I have been trying for a baby for about two months now, and we just don't understand that if the test was negative, then why haven't I started my period yet? I was supposed to start on valentine's day, and we were both very happy until I took the HPT last night. I know that stress can make me not start, but I haven't been under stress. Plus, I wasn't on any birth control at anytime in my life. What could it be?

20090225082336AAKzj9q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why won't the child I nanny cooperate?	I am a nanny to 3 kids, and 8 1/2 months pregnant with my first child. So, I'm trying to really understand the whole parenting thing ;)~ The youngest child is a 3 1/2 year old boy. He has been going through this stage the last few months where when he gets upset he starts groaning and screaming running in to the other room (throwing these huge tantrums). For example, if his 5 year old (bossy, controlling) sister does something he doesn't like he'll run in to the other room with his arms flaring and him making pouting faces. They are always together because both are in pre-k still. I'll go check on him and he yells at me and when I try to comfort him he doesn't want to be touched. All I want to do is get to the bottom of it, and make things right. Sometimes I will let them fight it out because they need to learn on their own also. His mom said that when he does this that he's probably mad at his sister for doing something that upset him. So, I tried bringing his sister in the room with me and figuring out their differences, and sometimes it helps, but sometimes it definitely doesn't. Does anyone have any suggestions? I don't want him screaming at me when I didn't do anything wrong. And, in general - he has been having these fits like crazy and they are unacceptable. I'm not his parents and I can not tell him how to be, but when I'm watching the kids I want to have fun, and be respected at the same time. Any suggestions would be great. I always try to give them positive reinforcement. Thanks!

It is so light I didn't notice it until I was about to throw it away. I know that the line has to be darker than the control line but my cycles aren't regular beacuse I just came off the pill so I think either I am about to have a LH surge or I just missed it. Question is if I just missed it is there still a chance that I could get pregnant now? I haven't had sex in about a week because I have been sick, but if we start tonight?

My daughter is 4 months and definitely teething; she drools like you can't imagine and will chew anything and everything she can get her hands on.   However, it looks like the teeth aren't coming in where they should. (front and bottom) Her gums are white and thin and there is a little red bump bottom left where a canine would be, then right behind where a premolar would.   We've just come from her 4-month check-up, where the doc said he didn't know what it was but definitely not teeth, because children get the front ones first.   I'm just wondering is it possible he's wrong? Did out of order teething happen to anyone else ?  Thanks !

My 16 year old son has servere anxiety issues, and one of his "problem" is laughing at very inappropriate times. (EX: Last year he had a laughing fit at his sister's funeral, then came home and cried) I'm definitely convinced that he cannot help it.      Today at school I got a phone call telling me to pick up my son from school because he's been suspended. Here's the story:      A guest speaker was talking about school shootings, and my son started to laugh. Everyone was staring at him (obviously) so he went into the hallway to laugh until he felt he could compose himself.      His teacher wrote him up for "defiance" and "skipping" and sent him to the office.      Should I try to fight that? Or would it be useless?

20090227120930AAhc1TP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	BumGenius 3.0 insert question! Please help!?	My little boy is 5 months old and we have been using the Bumgenius cloth diapers on him since he was about two weeks old, and we absolutely love them.    Until recently he has done fine with just the regular insert (the one that snaps down) and for overnight use we use the insert plus a doubler which keeps him dry as he sleeps ten or so hours at night.   For the last two days I have experienced leaking and so I have started to put an insert and a diaper doubler in all of his diapers.     Should I invest in some more inserts to combat the leaking problem?  He's only five months old so I figure he's going to start urinating more and more. I already change him quite frequently and don't want to have to wash all 37 diapers every day.   I would love any feedback on what inserts to use from mommies with older babies who use the Bumgenius! Thanks! :)

20090227123110AABucUu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Help what's wrong with my little girl?	My daughter is 11 weeks old now and yesterday she was extra irritable and grizzy more then normal. Then last night she had a terrible sleep, she went down at 7.30 and would normal sleep for 5-9 hours and only wake 1-2 during the night but last night she woke at 10.30pm, 12.30am, 2.30am, 5am then 6am and we're up for the day. Each time she just wanted to feed but would only take 1/2 a bottle. She seemed to have more wind but this might be cause I was awake more and noticed it. She hasn't slept this bad since we were in hospital. Also one of my friends reckon's she's teething as she keeps chewing on her dummy/pacifier and bottle teat. I thought maybe a growth spurt but she wouldn't take a whole bottle not sure if that's normal. Anyway got any ideas or experiences?

At two months when we were trying to stand him up, he was putting strong pressure on his legs so we thought that he's going to develop early. But my husband's mom said that we should not do that since it will cause him to be bow-legged. Now that he's three months, I'm worried he's going to be bow-legged just like his dad. Folks say to massage the thighs inward and pull the legs straight. Is that true? If so, I'm worried it's too late now that I didn't do it since he was born.

20081103115307AA0fAJ2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you be worried if a gay couple's children were at school/daycare with your children?	I'm asking because my children are in daycare and the woman in charge of the "phone tree" (where one parent calls another who calls another, etc.) called me at work to tell me I should pick up my children immediately because a gay couple dropped off their daughter and my children could possibly be "exposed" (forgive me ignorance, but I didn't realize sexuality was contagious) and when I told her she was insane, she got mad that I wasn't "afraid" of the gay couple.       So, would you be skeptical or afraid of leaving your children with the children of a gay or lesbian couple?      I don't understand why so many people get so worked up about a gay/lesbian couple. My mother was a horrible person, and even she taught me to respect others beliefs and wishes, regardless of if I "agree" with it or not.

Tonight I let him cry for 10 minutes and then I went to just give him a hug and tell him that it's ok, but that he has to sleep and when I got in there, he was so upset, I just picked him up and cried with him on the rocking chair.  My husband works all of the time, day and night and I am doing this by myself.  It breaks my heart to see him and hear him so upset.    He finally just stopped crying after 30 minutes.  I feel completely drained and can't go through this every night.

I also can feel the cramping much more worse in the afternoono... however, it was not as sever as my PMS pain. Do you think this is normal??? Is this sign of miscarriage?

My breasts have been very sore for a while and I've had serious cramps like I'm getting my period, but it never has come. I've been nauseous the past few days. I decided I needed to take a pg test.   I just took it and there was one very pink line and a very faint light pink one next to it. My boyfriend is convinced it's not positive because his son's mother had "two very dark lines". Has anyone else had this issue? It's a positive test isn't it?

Anyone have another bowl that stays put for self-feeding experiments?  It doesn't have to be suction.

My mother wants me to tell my brother‚Äôs wife (Tosha) that his ex girlfriend (Erin, which me & my mom are still very much close w/) is the Godmother of my unborn daughter. Now, I‚Äôd have absolutely no problem if he & Erin didn‚Äôt have an intimate past, so it kinda makes it weird. My mother‚Äôs like ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll understand. She‚Äôs not his asswipe ex-wife.‚Äù (Her names Tamekia; He was married once before & she turned out to be a very bad person). True, so very true, but still seems weird. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so true, but how do you tell your sister-in-law that her husband‚Äôs ex is your child‚Äôs Godmother???‚Äù & she goes ‚Äúyour child's Godmother can be anybody in the world...your choice. I'm sure she'll understand.‚Äù, which is ALSO true, but IDK.       Now, Tosha & Erin have seen & spoken to each other at my grandmother's funeral. Both said the other was very nice, but I know there can still be a bit of awkwardness. Especially now that the ex Erin is now considered family by way of my child.      How do I tell her?

20090306170608AA54HlB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Wouldn't this annoy you?	My best friend made plans with me a week in advance to go see a movie and pizza afterwards, but along the week she kept inviting all these other people, too. So plans about who's getting there, who's taking who where, and when were going where, is getting out of hand.      She told me the day of the movie that her parents were going to visit her brother so they could longer take us, so she went and got another ride without telling me. But then she says that the girl who's driving her there could PROBABLY take me there too. These were our plans together and now about 10 more people are going and now I PROBABLY will or wont have a ride there.      And on top of that, we were going out to get pizza after the movie, but my best friend made plans to spend the night at the other girls house (the one who is her ride to the movie) after the pizza, so she said "we wont be able to take you home, since were going somewhere else after and then to her house, so were gonna have to find you a ride with someone else, AGAIN"      Well, **** you then. So I told her to just forget it and that I didn't want to go anymore. I felt a little hurt by her attitude so I called my other friend to talk to her about it, but she didn't understand why I got mad. =/

20090307021039AAlmEfb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it ok to eat solids at 3 months for religious purposes? help!!?	My little girl is 6 weeks old and half Japanese, we live in Japan, my husband is Japanese and i am British.       Here in Japan they have a ceremony when the baby is 100 days old, kind of like a christening, and in this ceremony she would have to eat solid food for the first time - however anyone with children knows that now peds say you should NOT give solids to babies until 4-6 months.   (Personally i had never intended to start her on solids until 6 months!)      I dont want to put my little girls health at risk, and do this ceremony, but i know if i say no my in laws will freak out.    Actually the ceremony part i dont mind - im all for her being raised with 2 cultures traditions - its the force feeding i dont like.      What should i do? They dont buy the "shouldnt eat solids until 6months" argument because they did the ceremony to their kids, and started them on solids at 3 months etc.       At the same time i dont want to disrespect their traditions, and it would only be a mouthful of something like baby rice ... would it hurt her to do this?       Any suggestions?

20090306170916AAs01bM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Pro-lifers and pro-choicers, how do you feel about this 9 yr old's abortion situation?	Here's the article:  http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0...       A 9 year old brazilian girl was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant with twins. She had an abortion (abortions are illegal in brazil except in cases of rape and medical necessity) and the Catholic Church decided to excommunicate her, her whole family, and the doctors that performed the operation.      What do  you think of this? I'm pro-life, but in the case of a raped 9 year old, how can you blame her? She is a child and probably not fully capable of understanding that she is killing an innocent baby. This little girl will have to suffer the rest of her life knowing that she was raped and her child was aborted, WHY would the church turn her away in her time of need? I'm atheist, but I know that religious people turn to their churches for help. The church should be doing everything they can to help this poor girl, not condemn her. Besides I highly doubt a 9 yr old just came outright and demanded an abortion, I'm sure her parents were the ones who made her have it.
20090227124329AAFx5mD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Please could you give me your opinion on this?	I have been on dianette (combined pill) for 6 weeks and went on it for my spots. well, before that I had been trying to conceive for 6 months.      I have PCOS, so I have a much better chance of conceiving if I am 21 pounds lighter. My question is, seeing as I really want to get pregnant asap should I quit taking the birth control next week as I may get pregnant the next time I ovulate after stopping the pills, or should I be patient until I've lost the 21 pounds which would take around 2 months.           Please could you give me your advice, or any experiences. thanks.

20090307033753AA6ZGiP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it me or is my baby moving a bit slow?	My baby boy is going to be 4 months on the 17th of this month. He hasn't discovered his hands yet, but he bats at things and he'll grab things with a closed fist, if its big enough, he'll wrap his hands around it and then open his hands to "hold" it. he holds his bottle while we're feeding him but of course with closed fists . There's this toy on the side of his high chair and he plays with that when he wants to and he also grabs the bird that hangs over his bouncer and pulls it towards him . Idont understand, he does these things but is not able to completely grab something when he wants. Does he forget he has his hands sometimes? Now it seems like he's discovering his feet . I just read that one baby is 7 weeks old and laughing ! My son gives huge smiles but he doesn't laugh yet . He doesn't roll over yet either , He just swings himself from side to side trying to roll over . Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of his progress so far! Just a little concerned (I'm a first time mom) Help me out please !

I am a 16 year old girl, and my whole life i have always wanted to go to a summer camp. It seems like so much fun! The problem is, i feel kinda old to go to a sleep away camp. Is 16 too old to go to a traditional sleep away camp? I found a camp that is for girls, ages 10-18, but would it be weird if i went for the first time at 16 on my own? Will i meet friends, or will people already have friends? Is it easy to meet people? Just, what will it be like for me to go to a summer camp for the first time on my own at 16? Thanks!      P.S.

Hi,       my daughter is 3 months old, and I will be on maternity leave until she reaches 6 months. I am also trying to learn for an exam related to a certificate I would like to have when I return back to work.      When we are going out, my daughter seems to be very fussy about getting dressed (she usually is a calm, happy baby). The area where is live is quite residential, but there are cars even on the side streets.      Now that the spring came, I left my daughter in a baby rocker in the rear garden, while I was learning and was able to watch her - my desk in placed in front of the living room French doors. I only need to rock her for few minutes before she falls asleep for 1h, twice a day.       I am wondering whether I am doing her any harm by not taking her out every day? I am having my portion of exercise by going to the gym in the morning, before my husband goes to work. And the air in the garden is fresher than anywhere else outside? I read smth about baby benefiting from motricity such as the walk, but I guess the rocking is similar, although it's shorter?      Any thoughts?   Thanks
20090306170032AA5aFBs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do you ask your parents for birth control?	So, I have a parent that is more easy going (my dad, whom I don't live with), and one that's a hard *** (my mom, whom I live with).  I've been wanting to ask for the longest, but  I just don't know how.  In January, I was so close to asking my dad, but he kept talking about teen pregnancy and how bad it is since my cousin had just given birth and her life is really screwed right now, and because i didn't want to disappoint him, i told him i wasn't having sex when he asked me if i was.  My mom tried asking me last year if i was having sex, which i was, but i said no because i thought she would yell at me and just tell everyone that i am instead of trying to help me not get pregnant by offering BC.  She herself was a teen mom (had two before she graduated from HS).  I really want this done, I can't risk getting pregnant ( i know some ppl might say "but if you really don't want to risk getting pregnant then you shouldn't be having sex."  OR "you should be abstinent"  My response to both is, i know I shouldn't be having sex, but I am, and for abstinence, i think its so unrealistic, i simply don't believe in it and i think its just bullsh*t)  Now, I really can't go on without it, i really need it.  And I really need my parents to help me get it.  How do I ask them?

20090306164834AAW5bHz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I am a 20 year old, pregnant and live with my parents. they want me to give it up for adoption what should do?	N/A
20090306164908AA3nS9p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I need help with a problamatic child!?	My boyfriend's 3 year old throws severe tantrums, totally disrespects him by telling him no repeatedly, screams at him, he HAS to lay with her when she goes to bed or else she screams for hours on end, he puts TV on for her everynight for bed then won't go to sleep, when he tells her to do something it takes him 15 minutes of telling her to do it before she does and that's only when he gets mad.  Really my problem isn't with her...it's him.  I have tried to talk to him about this and all it does is present a huge argument because he sees nothing wrong with how she is.  He sees nothing wrong with how he does her either.  I have a 5 month old boy and DO NOT want him to pick up on her stuff.  I try to tell him these things but he gets mad at me and says I am just trying to make it out like she is bad.  My sister was like that with her child and she is now 13 and a complete bad ***...I fear that his child will turn out the same way...because of the parenting.  When we go to the store, she runs off and it takes us forever to find her and I addressed this too with him and he says it is ok...but these days you have to be scared because people abduct kids, etc.  I am at my wits end and don't want this to split us up...but it's possible because I just can't take it anymore.  When I try to enforce a bedtime so that we get adult time together, that just goes out the window because he doesn't back me up and enforce it.  WHAT SHOULD I DO????  How do I approach this with him because so far when  I do, we start out talking and end up arguing!
20090306165025AAm00jA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Love you too? What could it mean?	Okay, so my friend was messing on my AIM, talking to my crush, and typed, "Haha, I have to go now. I love you. <3" as a joke. And then my crush replied, "Love you too" before I left and smacked my friend for typing that in the first place.       Do you think he likes me?   He COMPLETELY ignores me at school, rarely starts the conversation, but when I talked to him a few months ago, he confessed he liked me and was being all romanticy. So what's up? Was it said as a joke?
