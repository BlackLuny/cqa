WwCBomTMaa	Because the second you say "I am worthy" you are no longer humble. Conceit fills the heart instead of love for God. None of us are worthy, until God tells us different. Those that say "I know I'm going to heaven" are second guessing God, for only those whose names are written in the book of life will go to heaven. We just need to make sure we do our best not to sin, and love God before any other.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I know.. what I have never understood is the whole "good works are dirty rags to God, they will never be good enough" When I hear that I'm like what....|`|2Hot9EJiaa	This actually is a great question-  the reason that we are not worthy of His love, is because we sin. God is Holy.  The truth is that God loves us SO much that He sent the one that is worthy- HIS SON-to die on the cross.  Grace made us worthy- we are not worthy apart from Him- because if we were there would not be a reason for Him to die.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	There is no need for any assumptions- God most certainly is there. Tragically, some people find out after it's too late. It's too late after we go to our graves to change our minds. We have to decide right now if we believe in him. The sands of time are running low.<br>  <br>  I think I am unworthy of God's love because I have made so many mistakes in my life. I have many, many regrets. I am sad because of the poor choices I have made. It's my fault. I am responsible for where I am today, and I am accountable for everything I have done in life.<br>  <br>  If you just accept Jesus into your heart and believe he is the son of God, you are saved. That's all that is required of you. <br>  <br>  I don't deserve happiness. I don't deserve mercy.

Every sin and every action you take really, good or bad, is a choice. So every time I have sinned, I chose to do so. I chose to basically spit in God's face and the great thing is that he loves me anyway. That is what unconditional love is about, and if I was worth of God's love I would not get to experience the perfection of unconditional love. I would only be loved because I earned it.<br>  <br>  edit: but He still had to watch His Son suffer and refrain from intervening<br>  <br>  Anyhow He still loves you, even if you don't believe in Him. That's called unconditional love.|`|AA10075527	Because we have to work hard for His love, because people sin everyday, not looking at all the wonders He's giving us, because people ruin everything good He does in this world and turn it into evil and ironically blame it on Him.

UxooffHZaa	1. Actually, all modern Wicca has at least some of it's history drawn back to Gardner. Many don't want to admit it. Some want to think theirs is somehow older, but ignore the ritual aspects that come right out of Gardner's BOS, or some consider themselves modern, but still use Gardnerian ritual ideas. <br>  2. No. The Pagan practices before Gardner in England were Mesopagan at best. That is, they were heavily influenced by Christianity. Some were "Satanic" because that's how they carried on their old religion. None of them were purely Neo-Pagan in the same way that Gardnerian Wicca was. When Gardner's Wicca was made known to the world, it was a mind-shift, and most prior Mesopagan groups (Witchcraft Theatre, like Gardner was initiated into, many Thelemites, and other Occultists) modernized their Paganism to the new information available. <br>  3. I don't call myself a Wiccan anymore. Wiccans are annoying as hell. Seriously. Some of them are nice people, but still annoying. They all believe they're "right," and everyone else is wrong. i.e. At one time they worshipped "Drawing Down the Moon" as Historical writ, and the more "enlightened" (full of themselves) ones now worship Ronald Hutton's history as writ. It's wrong thinking in my mind. (because the world is always more complex than yes/no) So, even if I do everything I do in a Wiccan format, I am not a Wiccan because I am not annoying and flighty. (not overly annoying anyway, except for right now of course)<br>  <br>  Yes. In a way it is a "revival," much like Crowley's other protege Jack Parsons tried to "revive" witchcraft in Pasadena to mixed success. (Gardner had achieved a "Prince of Jerusalem" ranking in Crowley's OTO) But, at the same time it is something new. I like calling it Neopagan, which is Isaac Bonewits (American Pagan, Wiccan and Druid) definition, because it calls up the Paganism of pre-Christian Europe (and elsewhere in the world), while distinguishing it from those as something that is at least partially, new. (neo)|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	Okay, excellent question, let me try to give you an at least coherent answer, because it's complicated.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft existed before Gardner and Valiente. Goddess worship existed before Gardner and Valiente. Nature worship existed before Gardner and Valiente. NeoPaganism existed before Gardner and Valiente. <br>  <br>  Modern Wicca, as we generally mean that, did not exist before Gardner and Valiente.<br>  <br>  Gerald Gardner and Doreen Valiente created what we now know as Wicca, using everything from Celtic and Roman mythology, Leyland's Aradia, Crowley, Mathers' Key of Solomon, the Golden Bough, Freemasonry, Rosicruciaism, the Boy Scouts (really) and anything else that wasn't nailed down. And yes, they probably did include some vestigial remnants of English witchcraft into the mix. This is what Wiccans mean when they say that "the world's oldest religion was created in 1951". Just about all Wicca, whether it calls itself Gardnerian or not, traces itself back to the Gardnerian Book of Shadows to a greater or lesser extent.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, the Wicca that Gardner and Valiente created is not the Wicca that we have today. Gardnerian Wicca remained more or less intact as it migrated around the world, until it crossed the Sierra Nevadas. Once that happened, California did to Wicca what it does to everything else, and people like Scott Cunningham, Starhawk and Margot Adler got ahold of it, and took what was really just another flavor-of-the-week of English ceremonial magick, and turned it into the environmentalist, feminist, socialist, intellectualist religious movement that we have today. This Californian mutation of Wicca rapidly spread across the US and Canada, and then to Australia and New Zealand and back to Europe, and now around the world. Gardner didn't live to see all of this, but Doreen Valiente did, and she apparently loved it.<br>  <br>  So, really, the world's oldest religion was created in 1970, or so. And continues to be created, every day.<br>  <br>  In answer to your third question, technically Wicca refers to Gardnerian Wicca and its many offshoots. However, it is coming more and more to be synonymous with NeoPaganism as a whole, largely because more people know what a Wiccan is than know what a NeoPagan is, so it's just easier for people to describe themselves as Wiccan, even if that isn't exactly correct. <br>  <br>  So for example, I happen to be a Gardnerian Wiccan initiate. But my primary spiritual path is Sean Ciall, which is a different branch of NeoPaganism. But if a non-Pagan asks me what my religion is, I would most likely say that I was Wiccan, not because of my Gardnerian initiations, but because the non-Pagan probably has never heard of Sean Ciall, and thinks that "NeoPagan" has something to do with a motorcycle gang.|`|3RYqo9dJaa	Gardner did and yet didn't make the thing up. He took old pagan practices and meshed them together to get what you see today. It's like an odd eclectic mix of a lot of religions.<br>  I don't follow Gardner, but my beliefs do stend from Wicca as well as a lot of other pagan practices.|`|yAvTxh47aa	The term Wiccan refers to someone whose beliefs are derived from Gardner's system...the derivation can be linear or non.<br>  <br>  The history of Wicca deserves more than one paragraph. I suggest the book Triumph of the Moon, by historian Ronald Hutton.|`|QiBBgOA5aa	no, he created the religion "wicca" that follows witchcraft (he didn't invent the beliefs)|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	If you're interested in Wiccan history, I strongly recommend Ronald Hutton's Triumph of the Moon.  It is, however, a very academic source.<br>  <br>  1. Gardner is the founder of Wicca.  He didn't, however, just pull it out of his hat.  He was influenced by a wide variety of older ideas which he synthesized into something new.<br>  <br>  2. No.  The religion he taught is unique.  No previous culture has ever followed a religion equivalent to Wicca.  "Pagan practices" is not a very helpful term, quite frankly.  It just means "non-Judeo-Christian practices."  There are lots of pagans who have vastly different beliefs.<br>  <br>  3. If you don't feel your practices descend from Gardner, it's really non-sensical to call yourself "WIccan."  Certainly you don't have to agree with him on every point...even the Gardnerian branch of Wicca has evolved since the time of Gardner.  But he is the origin.  If your beliefs come from somewhere else, they aren't Wicca.<br>  <br>  Just following ancient traditions absolutely does NOT make you Wiccan.  Asatru follow ancient traditions.  Celtic Reconstructionists follow ancient traditions.  Hindus follow ancient traditions.  Heck, Jews and Christians follow ancient traditions.  None of these groups are Wiccan.<br>  <br>  Wicca, like all religions, has specific beliefs and practices unique to itself.  Some are borrowed from other cultures, and some are very modern.<br>  <br>  Wicca is not "ancient witchcraft," which is a highly problematic phrase in and of itself.  That claim was based on the very faulty writings of Margaret Murray, which have been completely discredited for several decades.|`|yRzu9JfTaa	1) Gardener did not make the whole them up - he modified what have always existed. Wicca is a sort of revival of pre-Christian religion<br>  2)  He make western people more aware of it, but it have always existed, some in secret, some (in the Eastern world, such as Asian) in the open..<br>  3) Somewhat. Not all tradition and ritual are ancient, and they are not cast in stone. They can modified it or recreate new ones. <br>  <br>  If you are truly interest in Wicca, you should more books, for Wicca is a religion that value education, that believe knowledge is power. Internet is not reliable, and can get rather confusing for beginner.<br>  I would recommend Scott Cunningham or Raymond Buckland for beginner. Read review on amazon.com before you get them.

If you are referring to reincarnation, there is a high chance you will not be Jason Bateman again. However, if you are referring to Christianity's definition of "born again", the answer is both yes and no. Let me explain what I mean.<br>  <br>  When I say you won't be born again as Jason, I defer to 2 Corinthians 5:17: "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new." When we are truly born again, God sees Christ's perfection in place of our humanly disdain.<br>  <br>  When I say you will be born again as Jason, I am referring to how everyone sees you.

vEEeq7kYaa	The "threat" isn't that they're going to convert all the Jews. I really don't know of any Jew who is worried about that.<br>  The "threat" is the antisemitism they've escalated by teaching their co-religionists that they're "persecuted" because they believe in Jesus.<br>  Also..I'm really disappointed in your choice of "animosity in your posts".  Animosity implies hostile behavior and hatred.  This is just the type of thing that is taken out of context to "prove" that Jews are "persecuting" them, when we speak to the truth of Jewish identity and Judaism.  There is anger, not hostility. It is called for because I am sick of being "told" that I harbor hatreds that I do not.<br>  And I'm sick of the antisemitism.<br>  I don't think many Jews take this issue seriously enough.<br>  I can't tell you how many of the elderly Jewish folk I speak to who think the whole concept is so " absurd"..I have heard ...<br>  <br>  "This is just a fringe cult that will go away, who would take this idiocy seriously? It mocks both Christianity and Judaism, don't even given them any attention"<br>  <br>  That was the attitude in the early 70’s when the Jews for Jesus first started with their handouts that were so full of  appeal to bad Jewish stereotypes they came off as jokes.<br>  Many still continue with that head in the sand attitude.  Because while they’ve not been successful in taking Jews who are of the Jewish FAITH into their fold, they have been successful in some instances with the disenfranchised among the elderly and very young. Their largest growth has been a VERY large number of other Christians who now claim that they are Jews. <br>  Right now, across many communities in the South, there are more Christians posing as Jews, some of whom make an outward physical appearance of being more frum than the Lubavitcher Rebbe..than there are Jews.<br>  <br>  The VAST majority of these people never even had a Jewish Bubbe, let alone a Jewish mother.  More than 90% have no Jewish mother to claim any connection to Judaism by heritage.<br>  And the worst part is..the rest of the Christian community is taking THEIR word as AUTHORITATIVE about Judaism..  <br>  They easily convince these churches because not only are there so few Jews for them to see as examples of Judaism, but often their images of Jews is the stereotype that the "messianic" often plays full tilt.<br>  <br>  Most I've met make my Orthodox Bubbe look like a WASP.<br>  They ally themselves closely with the Christian churches because their beliefs are identical..They can quickly feel a connection of brotherhood and felicity through faith since they share the Christian faith. By teaching that their practices are actually the "original" form of Christianity they appeal to Christians who want to get back to their "roots". Both those claims are patently false if comparing modern Christian belief and ancient Jewish belief, even of the earliest followers of Jesus before the NT was written.<br>  <br>  This form of teaching and appeal creates animosity to JEWS who are often miniscule in number already in the area..where before..the animosity did not exist..<br>  The animosity and distrust result because they convince the Churches that the Jews are PERSECUTING THEM for their beliefs in Jesus!  They often PREFACE their instruction with this.   When the reality is..Jews are only trying to speak out for the AUTHENTICITY of Judaism!  Jews are not speaking out against Christians or their right to worship to or through Jesus.<br>  IGNORING it gives tacit approval.  It is also a violation of Jewish law if we do not speak out to the misrepresentation of Judaism.<br>  I thank God that more and more Christians of integrity are waking up to the fact that these groups ( as there are several who have jumped on this bandwagon, and supported by different evangelical Churches ) are perverting their customs, faith and heritage to the world, not just to Jews, in a bad light. <br>  Antisemitism has increased as a direct cause of the lies that are presented in their sponsoring churches and in their own churches they want to call synagogues that claim that Jews hate them for their beliefs.<br>  EDIT to add a long portion of another answer I gave to a similar question: Since this movement is now approaching 40 years old in this country, there are people who have grown up only knowing this false identity as their self-concept! To have that shattered can easily provoke great anger. Their loving parents raised them in that manner..what else do they know? Yet, their parents who love them and gave them a false identity also give them the seeds for hatred by telling them that Jews hate them for their belief in Jesus<br>  It is so sad to see the accusation that Jews here in Yahoo attack Christianity or display hatred and bigotry when we speak out against those who hijack Jewish identity by falsely claiming that Christian dogma could be a part of Judaism or Jewish belief. <br>  That is a form of passive-aggressive display of antisemitism..and I call it that because what else other than contempt for and hate of Jews would inspire one to utterly disrepsect the human rights of the Jewish people to use Jewish law for the purposes of self-identity and determination and insist that Jewish law is irrelevant? People do not bear false witness against another in love and respect! <br>  To claim one is a Torah observant Jew and follow the doctrine of the New Testament ( the Christian religion, incompatible with Judaism since it first appeared ) is utterly dishonest. To say this obvious fact is not attacking the right of people to HOLD BELIEF IN JESUS. **It is no more hate to claim that one may not believe in Jesus and call it Jewish than it would be for a Christian to be displaying hatred if they said that worship of Odin is not Christian belief.** It is not attacking Christianity to claim that Christianity is NOT JUDAISM and can never be Jewish belief.** It IS attacking JUDAISM to claim that an outside group has authority to change the eternal commandments of God to the Jewish people and say that Jews do not have the right to maintain the laws we have held for 3500 plus years for self determination. <br>  Another time in history that the Jewish people were so disrespected with regard to self-determination and identity was when the widespread false belief of Jews as a race was promoted by the Nazis in order for them to claim "racial" superiority, to anger and disrespect the Jews and culminated in the "final solution". This helped promote antisemitism when their views were held as legitimate over the right of Jews to self-determination and identity through Jewish law. Those were people who wished to do away with Jews and Judaism altogether. <br>  Both the concept that the dogma of a contradictory religion to Judaism or the pseudo scientific ideas of antisemites have authority to determine Jewish identity OVER the right of the laws of the people in question , reveals utter disregard and disrespect of the right of the Jewish people to self-determination according to Jewish law with regard to who is or is not a Jew. <br>  The Christian religion and the New Testament does not define for the Jewish people the dogma of Judaism. Christians of integrity and honesty do not do this. Unfortunately, I see a widespread practice has emerged whereby Christians presenting themselves as Jews go to churches and teach their fellow Christians that Jews are taught to hate Jesus and Jews who come to embrace him. That is the most dangerous lie of all being spread today. It is a false teaching that claims Jews are taught to hate Christians and that teaching is increasing antisemitism. The evidence of that is clearly on display in Y/A daily<br>  Judaism does not teach Jews to hate Christians. Judaism does not teach to hate Jews who convert to Christian belief. I know of no Jewish synagogue, rabbi or Jewish parent who teaches our children to hate Christians or those who convert to Christianity. <br>  I am connected to more than 50 Jewish regulars here from five continents and have yet to see any of them attack Christianity or any person for belief in Jesus.  I have seen anger, but more often than not, what is being accused of as hatred or animosity coming FROM Jews is that we are angry that we are once again obligated to defend against antisemitism.<br>  What we do is to speak out against individuals who speak dishonestly about JUDAISM. It makes no difference if they claim to be Christian, Jew, atheist or otherwise, if they are teaching things AS JEWISH that violate the core precepts of Judaism and Jewish identity that are recognized by all branches of Judaism in order to hijack Jewish identity, that's the obligation of every Jew on the planet, to speak out against it.<br>  Overall, in my every day life, I don't bother to think about Christian beliefs much. I am friends with many Christians. I have a few family members that are Christians. Until or unless they're trying to convert me, they misrepresent an aspect of my faith or they're hateful to me and try to base it on their belief, I get along with most folk. I try be respectful and tolerant of the right of individuals and groups to have their own unadulterated culture, customs and beliefs. My tolerance extends to the point where the expression of those beliefs violate certain standards of behaviors: If they attempt to violate another’s civil rights, seek to incite harm to anyone, willfully deceive another or misrepresent the beliefs of others then my tolerance ceases.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	I'm not a Jew, I'm an atheist.<br>  <br>  I don't think Judaism is correct. Not a bit.<br>  <br>  BUT, I am no friend to those who assert falsehoods, knowingly assert falsehoods.<br>  <br>  It really should be that simple; it isn't about the threat, its about the principle.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	My parents are Christian, but are willing to help me get to a synagogue when I visit them. TWO of the ones in their area are Messie. And you can't tell that from the phone book.<br>  <br>  And here they do circle like vultures around any Jew who might be leaning Jesus-ward. And most damningly, they've begun saying things like they're the "real Jews", that WE have no right to call ourselves Jews because we don't believe in Jesus.<br>  <br>  Yes, people here get overheated. That happens on nearly every subject except Buddhism. Some of us should probably calm down a wee bit.<br>  <br>  But I don't think we should surrender the playing field to them. They want to damage Judaism in the name of 'saving' it.|`|DTog0VZWaa	1.  I have been shocked in services to find the person next to me praying to Jesus.  In my Jewish synagogue, in my very small town.  Using my place to pray their religion.  It is a nasty, mean way to behave.  <br>  <br>  2. Website after website of theirs spreads Christianity with the label Judaism.  This is a real world danger.  Church after church has been visited & now sees their Christian beliefs as part of Judaism.  And sees them as valid representatives of Jews & and the rest of us as intolerant of them & by defacto, Christianity.  <br>  <br>  3.  Plus now we Jews could easily be  held responsible for their actions under the guise of "jew".<br>  <br>  4. Their rhetoric is IDENTICAL to the replacement theology hate that has murdered Jews for centuries.  You've got to be kidding me, if that doesn't sound dangerous to you.<br>  <br>  5. It has torn about family's where the child has been sucked in done just what you said.  Then typical of cults, come back to the family with that enstrangement factor.  I'm not intending to call it a cult, yet it has had that effect on family relationships.  And they've gone to nursing homes!<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  #2 & 4 are the ones that scare me.  One has to ask - if they had neutral no-big-deal intentions, why do they purposely pick a viscous naming choice & make it all about how they are one of US, the "real" us?  When something needs to be that deceitful & attacking, it's not to be underestimated.  It usually is underestimated until it's too late.  <br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Have you ever talked with one?  The passive-aggressive refusal to engage in anything but ignoring everything you say to claim "they are Jews" is so intensive it makes -you- angry.  It's really something to engage in it.  (In real life.)  <br>  <br>  So when you say animosity in the the posts, what do you mean?  Many of the posts explain things, but that's not animosity.  Telling them they aren't Jews, isn't animosity.  The only animosity is that they refuse to respect that.  I'd want exacting examples to understand better where the words could be changed to get the points across but more nicely.  (Seriously, I'm not being facetious.  Ocassionally I see something to wince at, but not that much -- so I'm missing it.)|`|Rl1Qqcqzaa	I agree pajama mama who detects a REAL threat in that the "messianic Jews" actions will lead to increased antisemitism against real Jews by those who just need an excuse to persecute Jews for not believing in Jesus.   This gives them the perfect excuse.  "See," they will say with a sneer, "these other Jews believe in Jesus so why don't you?"  Convinced that there is no valid reason that we (the real Jews) can not accept Jesus because the "messianic Jews" have shown them that we can, they will hate us and discriminate against us even more because we won't begin worshiping their god.  I won't be the least bit surprised when acts of violence against Jews start to be traced back to the false information that the perpetrators of such violence learned about us by way of "messianic Jewish" outreach to their fellow Christians.  Everytime an invited "messianic rabbi" gives a lecture on Judaism to a captive church audience, the false message that Jews can believe in Jesus and remain Jews is spread.<br>  <br>  This is why I view the "messianic Jews" not just as annoying liars but also as a dangerous threat to Judaism.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that pointing out (truthfully) that someone is a liar is animosity.  I don't believe that pointing out (truthfully) that despicable behavior is despicable is animosity.|`|UFJlZl4maa	It doesn;t make and sense whatsoever to call yourself a Jew and then celebrate Christmas!!! <br>  Like i've said many many many times b4, Christians are called that because they believe in Jesus Christ HENCE Christ in the words CHRISTian and in CHRISTmas!<br>  A real JEW doesn't believe in Jesus! and if they do, then they are Christians!!<br>  They may call themselves "Messianic Jews", but that goes against Judaism!|`|IogJBs2Naa	I just don't like them making a mockery out of my religion and using deceit and lies in something as sacred as religion.

It was horrendous for them when they discovered - both in different ways and at different times - that they had been duped by a Christian Evangelical.<br>  <br>  In addition - at almost every American college campus, there are Messianics and it is estimated that every year EIGHT THOUSAND naive young Jews, who have little or no knowledge of Jewish theology, are led astray into believing that Messianics are 'a new jewish group who practise christianity but are still jewish'!!!<br>  <br>  If Messianics are doing nothing wrong WHY WHY WHY do they LIE LIE LIE?<br>  <br>  What sort of people, what sort of Jews would WE be if we DID NOT COUNTER THEIR LIES about OUR religion???<br>  <br>  Remember: Messianics are condemned by almost all CHRISTIAN leaders too.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	NB: I've edited this after first posting it because a good friend on here pointed out that calling what I feel 'animosity' is not accurate.<br>  <br>  Well, I do feel considerable disquiet and irritation - not towards their beliefs, not because I'm concerned about a threat in the sense of them converting Jews but because they have confused so many people about what Judaism actually IS.  It's hard enough to try to communicate about it when most people have Christianity as their template of what a religion is - and Judaism is so very different.  Then in come the Messies, declaring that they're the real Jews and somehow we've gone astray - well, anyone who didn't know about Judaism to start with would assume even more that it's Christianity without Jesus.  I don't need anyone to believe what I believe, but I really do want them to appreciate that I find a very different beauty in Judaism from anything resembling Christianity, and to say that the Messies are muddying the waters is an understatement.<br>  <br>  But the real irritation (not active hatred, as is implied in the word 'animosity') is a RESPONSE to their extreme judgemental arrogance, their determination to claim that we can't read our own Tanakh, haven't understood what our religion is about, etc.  Using the word 'Judaism' to mean something totally different from Judaism and then claiming they've got it right.....

However, once we have that faith it should be followed by works which will glorify God.<br>  <br>  Those who lived prior to the birth of Jesus e.g. Abraham, had faith in God the Creator and awaited the Saviour.

Here is proof:<br>  ":Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble." James 2:19.<br>  So what does the Scriptur say we are to do? This!<br>  "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?" 1John 5:1-5<br>  And just what 'law' is being spoken of?<br>  "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." Romans 7:7.<br>  So we see here that the 'law' that we are being told to obey is the 10 Commandments Ex 20. And that does not mean 9 with the exception of the fourth, no it means ALL of them including the Fourth.<br>  Read also:<br>  "Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works." 2Corinthians 11:15.<br>  "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works." Revelation 20:12.<br>  "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works." Revelation 20:13.<br>  "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." 2Timothy 2:15.<br>  There you have it.

In the book of Genesis chapter 19; it mentions that Lot[Abraham's nephew] extended hospitality to two of God's angels.Then a mob of homosexuals,boys to old men surrounded the house and wanted to rape the angels. The mob even tried to break down the door! !The angels blinded the mob and subsequently after that Sodom along with Gomorrah was annihilated.|`|vhlORK4Waa	For the sins of their inhabitants Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim were destroyed by "brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven" (Genesis 19:24-25). In Christianity and Islam, their names have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of God's wrath.<br>  <br>  Sodom and Gomorrah have been used as metaphors for vice and sexual deviation. The story has therefore given rise to words in several languages, including the English word "sodomy", a term used today predominantly in law (derived from traditional Christian usage) to describe non-vaginal intercourse, as well as bestiality.<br>  <br>  Sodom was one of a group of five towns, the Pentapolis (Wisdom 10:6): Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Bela -- also called Zoar (Genesis 19:22). The Pentapolis region is also collectively referred to as "the Cities of the Plain" (Genesis 13:12) since they were all sited on the plain of the River Jordan, in an area that constituted the southern limit of the lands of the Canaanites (Genesis 10:19). Lot, a nephew of Abram (Abraham) chose to live in Sodom, because of the proximity of good grazing for his flocks (Genesis 13:5-11).<br>  <br>  In Genesis 18, God informs Abraham that he plans to destroy the city of Sodom because of its wickedness. Abraham pleads with God not to destroy Sodom, and God agrees that he would not destroy the city if there were 50 righteous people in it, then 45, then 30, then 20, or even ten righteous people. The Lord's two angels found only four righteous people living in Sodom, including Abraham's nephew Lot and his wife and two youngest daughters. Consequently, God destroyed the city.<br>  <br>  In the Tanach version, Genesis19:4-5, the final episode in the story of Sodom is described as the angels visit Lot to warn him to flee:<br>  <br>  When they had not yet retired, and the people of the city, the people of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, the entire populace from every end [of the city]. And they called to Lot and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, and let us know them."<br>  <br>  Lot refused to give the visiting angels to the inhabitants of Sodom. He offered them his two daughters instead, but the people refused. The men were struck with blindness, allowing Lot and his family, who were then instructed to leave the city, to escape. As they made their escape the angels commanded that Lot and his family not look back under any circumstance. However as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with fire and brimstone by God, Lot's wife looked back longingly at the city, and she was instantly transformed into a pillar of salt.<br>  <br>  In Ezekiel 16:48-50 God compares Jerusalem to Sodom, saying "Sodom never did what you and your daughters have done." He explains that the sin of Sodom was that "She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me."<br>  <br>  <br>  Does that help any?<br>  Halcon|`|AA11707311	Sodomy has it's origin in the word Sodom, and is exactly what the Sodomites wanted to do to the angels in Genesis 19:5.|`|ZiO1MnIFaa	Sodom was allegedly destroyed by fire and brimstone because of its exceptional wickedness and depravity, and yes that is where the word was derived from.|`|209E8kyVaa	The words Sodomy and sodomize originate from the city Sodom<br>  The reason is the people of Sodom practiced sodomy|`|mC4mnvGFaa	sodomy ( the act of anal sex) was, indeed, named after the fictional city of Sodom|`|0lpXN8p9aa	That is correct and also the reason that Sodom was destroyed!

jAc7AgOiaa	My boyfriend and I fo not French kiss anymore because we made the mistake of sex before marriage. French kissing always opened the door for us to do other stuff. It really depends on how much self control you have and what you feel comfortable with.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|R21mr14zaa	I'm not a Christian, but I'd like to implore you to think about what you're saying.  You're 24.  You've been an adult for years.  You need to draw your own boundaries.  Sex is a pleasurable act.  It's nothing more, nothing less.  The only reason to control what you do in this regard is to avoid hurting yourself and others (in whatever way).  So long as you're smart, it does no harm.  I know that you may be thinking I'm trying to corrupt you or something, but really I'm just trying to get you to think beyond what you've been told by your church, or whatever.  If you do so, you'll realise that no one except yourself can decide on your boundaries.  And when you do, they'll be all the more important.|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	I suggest you get married girl.

One does not have to have intercourse, there are many other things.  <br>  <br>  If you are 24 or older it is your life.  All religions were created by Man and Not by God.    Follow Gods rules and you will be fine.|`|j0oU4V3baa	you might as well just be friends cus normal adult couples actually have some interaction|`|AA11707311	Keep pants on.|`|i48kxrbaaa	You're 24...do whatever you want.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	I don't personally think there is anything wrong with sex before marriage, but I'm atheist. I think you need to take a "test drive" before getting into a marriage. If there is not chemistry, no matter how nice they are, the relationship will always lack some thing.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you have a set of values, and one of them is to remain a virgin until your married, stick to your guns. <br>  <br>  You decide what YOUR boundaries are. If you think french kissing and being kissed on the neck is OK, then go for it. <br>  <br>  Just know that usually, when someone starts kissing other body parts other than the hand, lips or face, in my experience, does tend lead to clothing removal and kissing of other parts. So just don't be afraid to tell a guy to stop. <br>  <br>  It's also best to let they guy know ahead of time, before things get too physical, that you don't want to have sex before marriage. This could cause some issues, as most men past that age don't want to wait. But don't compromise who you are just for them.<br>  <br>  If you do have issues with that, perhaps you should also look for singles groups that are sponsored by a church? That way, hopefully the guys you meet will be of a similar mind set. <br>  <br>  I believe there are also dating web sites that are Christian specific. Try searching some of those out.|`|jgRRsG8Daa	It is not christianity that lays down boundaries in moral behavior which<br>  includes dating.The limits are set by individuals and in some instances <br>  their parents who have their own codes and sets of rules as to what constitutes decency.Of course,society too has laid down its own rules of behavior.In the ultimate analysis the individual has to decide but at the same time be prepared to face the consequences,parents/elders in the family and society at large.There are no books to suggest these sort of things.One does what comes naturally,taking suitable precautions to avoid consequences and should not look for patsies to blame.One should have the courage to accept what one feels and <br>  knows is wrong.Have a Nice Day.|`|pTkjGfBRaa	Just looking at someone and holding their hand is sexual.  Being in someone's presence is sexual.  We are sexual creatures and we can't avoid it.<br>  <br>  I suggest a good boundary in Christian dating is nothing that leads to baby-making because we take the act of Genesis, the act of creating life so seriously.  Keeping your pants on is a good boundary as is no genital contact.  (Note that Genesis and genital come from the same root word, creation).  Kissing the neck and french kissing is ok.  It is no more sexual than hand-holding and looking at someone.<br>  <br>  To repress our sexuality is to repress who God made us to be.  We need to steward this precious gift, but bottling it up and stuffing it down is not living up to who God calls us to be.  We are called to be sexual creatures because that is who God created us to be.  <br>  <br>  If you spend too much time repressing your emotions, you will:<br>  1) Not be skilled in handling them when they come up.<br>  2) Not be prepared when all of that repression wells up into an uncontrollable tsunami.<br>  3) Spend your life in misery (which is not the way that God created you to be).|`|j3wXdTuuaa	Normally kissing  leads to other things andif you want to stay sexually pure until til you are married then don`t do it.I suggest you talk to your pastor or anybody you else you know and trust.The answers giving here will only confuse you even further.God will bless you for kepping yourself pure until marriage.|`|O8n3FYK0aa	I would really recommend (and please don't be turned off by it's title, because I was. Then I read the book and I loved it!) "I kissed dating goodbye" great book for those that listen.|`|MYrwcjDSaa	I would set the boundary of no sodomy on the first date. I suggest to you the book "Secrets of Kama Sutra".|`|9pXeC0EGaa	That's funny...how different we are. You put boundaries in place and I tear mine to shreds. I wonder who's enjoying life more? I know...ME!|`|V610w8EXaa	Yeah, pants on (for BOTH of you) seems like a good rule ... otherwise, go for it.

I used to always want to be in control when I was younger but it's grown rather tiresome. I'm much rather just sit back and pitch in how, when, and where I'm asked.

For example, I decided to repaint and put down tile in the family room.  I knew what look I wanted, knew how to install the crown molding and trim I wanted, and knew how to do the prep work for the tile.  I actually needed help because of time constraints, and my helper took over on laying the tile, but I really didn't need or want advice on that. I had the color in my mind, and mixed it until I got just the right shade of warm yellow.  I did NOT follow "keep it neutral" advice I'd read because I wanted the walls to be the feature that greeted me.   However, I'm going to tile over tile in my hall bath, and you can bet I'm going to get advice on how to do that before I start, since I've put tile over water-resistant drywall before, but I've never done this particular "fix" before.<br>  <br>  In other words, the problem, not the personality, determines the best path.<br>  <br>  I'm agnostic leaning toward atheism religiously.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	There are times when you need to ask for directions.

And eight is too many armadilloes for one uterus.<br>  <br>  Also:  Armadilloes can carry the virus which is responsible for Hansen's disease (also known as leprosy), but don't suffer from it themselves.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:  The answer below me is correct in that nine-banded armadilloes are the only potential Hansen's carriers (as far as anyone knows).  As far as I know, they are also the only armadillo species which has the polyzygotic quadruplet birth system.  Not nearly as much is known about the other armadillo species, which are less numerous and don't live in North America.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	We're cloning Siva.

People seem to bond easily with a common goal:  to get ready for their marriages.<br>  <br>  They present questions for discussion, and some really make you think.  But nobody is forced to say anything they don't want to say.<br>  <br>  It seems like a pretty positive experience.|`|wVet0QXVaa	Ours was in a large class (I hear this is abnormal) but everyone was really friendly and nice, but we mostly talked to our future spouse.  It's really about getting to know your partner and to talk about the important (but less romantic) issues of money, finance, children, religion etc.  You'll have classes that are more comfortable than others, but in general, you'll probably learn a lot and really like it.  My husband is an atheist, so we were worried they would really judge him harshly, but it wasn't that way at all.

bqkgTCEhaa	ME TOO! Though it sounds foolish as answering this were it true would mean absolutely nothing I have wondered this throughout my entire life. I mean how do you know any of what goes on outside your own vision really exists, part of this I think has to do with the psychology topic object permeance but if you think abotu it why do other people have to really exist they could be just developments of our own imagination that we on some subconcious level control and our minds create a background story to and mode of operations in how we interact. There is NO way to prove that anything that happens when we aren't there really does happen or we just create events and the truthful results are there only because we imagined them or something of the sort.<br>  <br>  I'm actually quite happy somebody understands this feeling as it is rather hard to explain to those around you if they've never felt it and some just call you self centerred saying you would make yourself the center of everything but honestly what proof is ther I (you) are not and everything else is just a reaction to your being and construct of your own mind.<br>  <br>  THANK YOU!!!|`|4BQdeSwwaa	I compare this to being in a dream, you think its real and you think its really happening.

Some may be coerced into believing a religious view but most are simply brought up in it and are usually denied access to other trains of thought or views.

Quite unfortunate really.|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Yes God gave us free will but I think you got the idea confuse about Thanking God for something good that happens and of something is messed up. <br>  <br>  We thank God for being born in a free land, we have no free will over that. We thank God at the end of the day for allowing us to still have a fully functional body still, we have no control over that. <br>  <br>  It's arrogant for us to think that we are the only force responsible for everything we accomplish in our life because in all reality God allows everything that happens to us to happen.

However, when you are told since the day you are born that God exists, the Bible is his book and you better follow it, you treat it as fact. It's very easy to let it override your rationale and mental processes because it is what you know and it is the most convenient way to live your life. Some people just don't want more in their lives and just want simplicity.|`|AA10075527	Oh so nuns and priests are brain washed ?<br>  Wut the hell are u talkin about man!

6IXrgxqSaa	Hey Skater Girl. This is a great question and the majority of humanity is not sure of the answer so don't feel bad. We have different paths to the our purpose in life yet we all share a common goal. God (the Upper governing force of absolute bestowal and love) wants us to achieve the sensation of eternal perfection and pleasure by becoming like Him in His attributes. Those attributes being absolute love and bestowal. Then a person can realize the purpose of their life.<br>  <br>  This can only be achieved if man wishes to correct his egoism, which is acting with the intention of for the sake of himself and correcting it to for the sake of others. Then humanity would realize/obey the law of Nature, "love thy neighbor as thyself". Then instead of doing things to benefit ourselves we work to benefit the whole of society. All of humanity is interconnected and dependent of one another (like cells in a single body) and us not observing this law of Nature is reason behind all aspects of the growing global crisis and suffering felt in life since we are not in balance to God's law. I added some links that I hope can help answer your heartfelt question and you find what you seek.

However, if a female student is hooking up with her male teacher then people assume he's some kind of sick sick person and she's harmed forever.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	I'd say that is something a boy will remember for life.  A scar I don't know.  There is a double standard though.  When a grown man sleeps with a young girl it is looked at as being much worse.  Society wants to protect women.  Personally I would kill a man who touched my young daughter if I had one.|`|IGXE3aDraa	turn it around. if it was a 30 something male teacher with a 16 year old girl everyone would have this teachers head. by not doing anything to female teachers that would be a double standard. either way it is a child that is being molested.|`|Rp7VvIOdaa	if your talking about high school cases I don't know who begins but the student sure don't refuse.

In most cases when a male is hurt, (underage sex, abuse by a female, etc) it either goes unreported or is downplayed among "the guys" as some sort of artificial proof of manhood. In many cases it may negatively effect the boy's future marriage and/or relationship or view of women. Just think of the the teasing by fellow student and what inner feelings he'd *really* have. But in some cases it may not negatively effect, just as it may not effect some girls who've had the chance to sleep with a "fantasy" teacher. But, society holds males to a lower standard.|`|9fsBGllDaa	The idea is that while an adolescent can make the choice to have sex, he doesn't really understand the ramifications of the act.  An adult has been there him/herself and understands the value of sex.  Thus, when an adult has sex with a minor, he or she is taking advantage of that adolescent's naivete, his innocence.  It's not an equal exchange, it's exploitation.<br>  <br>  That being said, growing up is about "scars."  What separates adults from children is that adults have experienced pain and have learned to cope.  Clearly, if an adult is having sex with children and adolescents, then the coping process went wrong somewhere for that person.  But getting hurt, getting smeared and dealing with it is how we grow up.  Dealing with being taken advantage of should be treated on a person-to-person basis.  Maybe a guy grows up fine.  Maybe he idealizes an adult woman and can never find satisfaction with a girl/young woman his own age.  There are lots of ways an experience like the kind you've described can affect a kid.|`|y0jpOyADaa	It depends on the male. Some may not care and just be happy to have sex (as odd as the situation may be), but some may find it repulsive that it was with a teacher, someone who is supposed to help children.

If I was 15, and got laid by the hottest teacher in the school, I'd be in heaven.  In no way would I be scarred, but that's me.  It depends on the situation and the people involved.  It's kind of a double standard though.  I feel teenage girls would be more than likely the ones being scarred, because they're more sensitive and males are more over powering.|`|frt3q5uOaa	that really all depends on whether he thought she was hot or not. haha<br>  i'd say any age before puberty would probably be messed up.<br>  but anything after and i'd consider that bragging rights.<br>  unless of course it was one haggard woman. <br>  <br>  i had this reaaaally bangin spanish teacher, and to be honest, i wouldn't mind. <br>  mmm Ms.Vargas|`|hCC5GKgJaa	No, the kid did it because he was hot for teacher, he was pumped, and his guys gave him a good fist pound. she went to jail, he went to college, the end.|`|1sOWpQR2aa	Yeah I wouldn't be scarred either..

RTaimrg7aa	I thought I answered at least part of this....<br>  <br>  1) It is generally believed that when God refers to the "US" there it is referring to the trinity.  So it's 3 in 1.<br>  2)In the culture of ancient mesopotamia you don't mention the birth of women since they culturally viewed as less significant. <br>  3) I could have been incest, but I think that God created more than one man (and woman?)   It was only Adam and Eve that were placed into the Garden.<br>  <br>  The bible has been preserved through the ages because of it's veneration throughout history.  These are viewed as the very words of God and therefore were preserved through careful transcribing.<br>  <br>  The "He knew her" comes form the King James version.  It is the same time period we get the anagram For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.  Sex meant "knowing" someone.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you got "given birth with the help from the lord."<br>  <br>  the 365 1/4 year was discovered in 1500's the Old testament times would have had a different calandar year based on moon phases and length of the days and nights.<br>  <br>  Everyone would have their own perspective  that is why the story seems to "change" <br>  <br>  Dinosaurs are under discussion so no one really knows.  the other planets were made when God made them "in the begining" according to the bible.<br>  <br>  If mans wassn't meant to go to the moon he would have never made it....and some say he hasn't.<br>  <br>  "magic" exists most of it leads to destruction and pulls away from God.|`|nbLqaRyMaa	FYI, your not getting any answers because no one wants to read that much on yahoo answers.|`|DapNp1Kxaa	Really long question; fairly short answer-for me!<br>  1) God the father was speaking to His son, who while on earth, would be known as Jesus. This son is called His 'only begotten" because God created him alone. Everything else was created with this son as his Master worker, or helper. <br>  2) Bible only says that Adam and Eve became parents to sons and daughters, no specific time for the first daughter to have been born. Yes, when the scripture says that Adam "knew" Eve, it's speaking carnally, or sexually. That's how all their children were born.<br>  3) Since we don't know how long after his birth Cain married, we can't be sure if it was a sister he married, or a niece. It's incest today, but with no specific law against it at that time, it seems that it was alright with God, or He would have forbidden it as He did later. People lived much much longer then, being closer to human perfection, without all the DNA problems that result from intermarriage now. <br>  You ask some really good questions, and studying the bible will be helpful to you, but probably not on your own. It's awfully hard to get the sense of it by yourself. Pray for guidance, and guidance will come your way. Just be sure to open the door for it when it knocks.|`|AA11002471	1)   God was speaking to Jesus. Revelation 3:14<br>  2)   Adam & Eve had sons and daughters together.  Genesis 5:4<br>  3)   It seems God is not against it. At least not at that time.<br>       Mind you, if a son grew up, moved away and came back to a sister he never knew, it makes it a bit more palatable.<br>  <br>  Please keep in mind that the Bible is not a detailed account of everything. Especially in the early years ....its a thumbnail sketch.<br>  However, that which is there is what God decided we should (need) to know.<br>  He is capable of producing a book.<br>  Maintaining it accurate as well.<br>  After making the universe, a book seems child's play.<br>  Please don't rely solely on the KJV. Get yourself a variety of translations.<br>  "Knew her" is the KJV way of saying they had sex.<br>  Its true Eve said she gave birth with the help of the Lord, however, that was just her opinion. It wasn't accurate. She had been rejected.<br>  Genesis 3:15 talks of a woman having a seed ....or child.<br>  Eve was hoping beyond hope she was that woman.<br>  She wasn't because it is not a real, literal woman.<br>  You should do like me .....talk to Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  They have some very good, logical answers.

For instance, "Quand j'étais petite, j'avais peur du noir." (="When I was little, I was afraid of the dark.") We often use the imperfect with "quand" (when).<br>  <br>  The imperfect tense goes like this:<br>  Je travaillais<br>  Tu travaillais<br>  Il/elle/on travaillait<br>  Nous travaillions<br>  Vous travailliez<br>  Ils/elles travaillaient<br>  <br>  Edit: Billiee, don't confuse the imperfect (="imparfait") with the "passé composé", which we build by using an auxiliary verb with a past participe. For example: "J'ai fini de manger." (="I finished eating.") or "Le bébé a fait une sieste de deux heures." (="The baby took a two hour nap.")<br>  <br>  In your paragraph that you wrote, the only imperfect I see is "était". Maybe your teacher was simply expecting more than that one form.

There are ppl who get married and deliberately decide not to have children. What's the difference.  We should all be able to come together in love.

We lived there for almost three years. None of the non-denominational churches were ANYTHING like the ones in the South.

Just as the patriarch David did, full of the joy of the Lord, danced before the Ark of the Covenant, the symbol of God's presence in his day. <br>  <br>  Not like ballroom dancing.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|96AQZUGyaa	No you aren't. Vampires aren't real.

Human blood is extremely nutritious, so I can see why it makes you 'feel stronger'. <br>  <br>  As a side note, blood has a lot of iron in it so maybe why you crave it is because you have an iron deficiency (or some other nutrient).

WYk0zYdhaa	The bible does not say clearly on this.  However the bible clearly speaks out against talking to mediums or spritists, psychics (people that claim to talk to spirits)  in Levi 19:31<br>  31'Do not turn to (A)mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.<br>  <br>  again in Levi 20:6<br>   6'As for the person who turns to (A)mediums and to spiritists, to play the harlot after them, I will also set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people.<br>  <br>  we know demons to be real and here to tempt and distract.  They like to play to our imaginations and can present themselves as ghosts see familiar spirits.  Yes, there is a difficulty with believing in ghosts as in people that have died and are somehow stuck between here and some after life.  If we hold the bible to be true there is no such place.  There is Heaven and Hell.  In the old times it was called Sheol which meant abode of the dead.  It was prior to Christ coming to repair the relationship between God and man so that we can accept Him and enter into Heaven.  As one that holds the bible as true I cannot believe in ghosts, they are demons.  <br>  <br>  Good question though.

Luke 24: 36-43.<br>  He doesn't seem to have told them ghosts didn't exists.  Indeed it was recorded that after the death of Jesus, the dead rose from the cemeteries and were seen around town.

vhlORK4Waa	The word is not Spanish, but comes from a native tribal language. <br>  <br>  The word is used in Spanish too, but comes originally from Quechua, a family of languages spoken by Indian peoples of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina<br>  <br>  However I did find this <br>  <br>  Llama derived its name from “Como se llama?”, Spanish for what’s its name?  When the Indians repeated the word, llama, the name for the animal became “name” or “llama”.<br>  <br>  which I think is unlikely; llama is pronounced YAMA - but then I do not know how the South Americans pronounce the word llama, it might be "Yama"!!<br>  <br>  To ask someone's name in a formal setting, say '?Cómo se llama usted?' or 'KOH-moh say YAHM-ah oo-STED.' (The 'oo' rhymes with 'moo.' This means, 'What is your name?'<br>  In an informal setting, or if speaking to a child, say '?Cómo te llamas?' or 'KOH-mo tay YAHM-ahss.' That also means, 'What is your name?<br>  <br>  So I think I shall stick with the Quetcha origin<br>  <br>  Halcon :-))|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Because its not english.It could be spanish or indian or even tibetan|`|GPznIhzMaa	I think the word is Spanish. <br>  <br>  Post this again in the Wordplay section.|`|FUVoy02Uaa	What would you like us to call them?

Also the noun always comes before the adjective.

qtXsNipdaa	No way should people be limited by a piece of paper.  How arrogant is the religious system of today!  Sure there are different levels in Christ.  A new Christian should have a foundation but they should not be limited in preaching the good news.  I find it sad that people with a history of divorce, drug use, etc are told NO they can't be a missionary.  They are the very people that understand the grace of God and how He can redeem you from sin.  Yes, the Holy Spirit leads and guides us.  We can minister to people every day.  Even in a smile and a simple act of kindness we can change a person.<br>  <br>  So should people get a degree?  No, but in today's religious system, you have to get one.<br>  <br>  Gladys May Aylward is a great example!  You should read about her work in China.

What's his problem with amputees?|`|IDZTtipeaa	I think perhaps the point is missed.  I think the goal behind the "healing amputees" is that it would be a clear sign of a supposed miracle.  Many people credit God with curing many different ailments.  Sometimes there are very clear, logical explanations, but not always.  Doctors don't always know why a cancer goes into remission, so it is tempting for a believer to declare this a miracle of God.<br>  The point of the amputee argument, again IMO, is that clearly, with what we know, an amputee cannot fully regrow a lost limb (though if it did happen I would still wait for a medical explanation, which is why I don't use this argument to begin with).  If this happened, it might be clearer evidence of a God.  Basically, if one believes God cures cancer and other illnesses, why does He choose NOT to cure amputees?|`|9m2LvlWdaa	You can use all the round about reasonings you like. But your version of god is still a murderous, temper-tantrum-prone, malevolent and bigoted deity. Tell me again how an all knowing/all loving/all powerful entity could be so? That's right. It can't. Even my human brain knows that is an oxymoron.|`|AA11282654	Because you believe no amputees on Earth are good enough to warrant attention in the subjective eyes of the all-loving Lord.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I think the god healing amputees thing is more meant to be a rebuttal to those claiming that faith healing is real and proof of god. Its a valid point to make that nothing that would clearly be evidence of a god's healing is ever seen.|`|j0oU4V3baa	Once again, you guys are thinking for God to suit your own claims he/it exists. <br>  <br>  It's your typical "God works in mysterious ways" nonsense argument.<br>  <br>  **Science will actually make an artificial leg or arm.

I choose the latter explanation.|`|SK5wHr5zaa	A very sad and pathetic interpretation of  just one glaring example of the total nonsense of the claims of this bronze age publication called the bible. I mean do you really want a list of all the diseases which God can't/won't cure. We all know God doesn't do "amputees", but it would be much easier to list what he does do. It is truly unfortunate that God doesn't do amputees other wise you would have a new head and wouldn't have made such a fool of yourself by presenting that question in such a laughable manner.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Isn't that convenient.<br>  <br>  As I recall, syphilis is not mentioned in the bible, cancer of any kind, diabetes, hemorrhoids, school exams...

I've always believed it to be THE perfect size!<br>  <br>  Besides, there's nothing like a brain to make any body shape look more attractive.<br>  ?|`|i1OCL13Jaa	Amputees are the least of my concern with your mad book.|`|7hpXsYOCaa	I do understand, easy...god is imaginary.|`|Ob0GqDc1aa	Sorry, the argument fails. Next.|`|AA11595906	Enough of this amputee crap.  If there was a god, I would be larger than a B cup.  A good god would do that for me.|`|QVKWVValaa	My rebuttal is that believers in the God to which you are referring pray to him day in and day out to heal them from some affliction.<br>  "Oh God, please heal my stubbed toe."<br>  "Oh God, please heal my cancer."<br>  "Oh God, please save me from my abusive marriage."<br>  "Oh God, please save me from my lonely life."<br>  These are but a few. All these people will expect God to heed and answer their prayers. If they have enough faith, and random chance heals them of whatever it was the afflicted them, these believers triumph in their recovery and quickly thank God for healing/saving them.<br>  So, are you of the opinion that an amputee has never prayed to God for their arm back? Or to have both their legs back? All we are trying to point out is that if the miraculous recovery of the stubbed toe or cancer patient is attributed to the wonders of God, how is it that God never helped someone grow a leg back?<br>  And God did make a pretty big show of healing lepers while he was on Earth in the form of Jesus. Seems God knew the appeal of healing as a means of drawing in the followers. It would seem to a believer that the miraculous healing of the stubbed toe shows God still knows what it takes to draw 'em in. But still there's the no legs thing...<br>  You see, what you are really missing in the whole amputee thing is that God didn't heal any of the people. It was something real, something of this world. Maybe the stubbed toe wasn't that bad. Maybe the cancer patient's immune system simply had an extra good day. But here, in the real world, there is nothing that can regrow a missing limb... especially not a fictitious God.
p8Mc6rpBaa	I'm not trying to offend anyone but Detroit is pretty bad. The city is just extremely gentrified and run down. Also the winters are brutal. Many people that I know from Detroit and sick of the brutal winters. Most of the cities in the region know affectionately as the "Rust Belt" make the polls of worst cities. <br>  <br>  As far as best cities it really depends on what you like. Florida and California have the best weather but with slumping economies and high cost of living  residency has become miserable despite the weather. Denver and Salt lake City are clean scenic cities if you love the outdoors and snow. Dallas and Houston offer great cost of living but succumb to the problems associated with larger populations. New York and DC are excellent cities for culture and diversity but the cost of living is outrageous. The southern and southeastern states now offer best of all worlds. With reasonable cost of living, just enough culture, bearable winters and ideal location for travel cities in these states are very appealing.|`|fia9gMHpaa	Detroit, LA,Phily are the worst for crime.

There are no opportunities out there in terms of starting a career. I've seen so many adults with jobs that teenagers should have, such as Wendy's McDonald's, burger king, local supermarkets etc. I don't think its a bad thing that they work there and that's the life choice they made but, I believe it has to do with the opportunities that they have at reach. The crime rate is high, there are so many unsolved murders, drug dealers and even prostitutes(I've seen them around my school area).  Granted this stuff happens everywhere,but I was in this particular city and realized it. It is not a good place to raise children, if easily influenced they could get in a lot of trouble in Richmond<br>  <br>  Its funny I'm from NYC, but I would love to live in DC.<br>  <br>  No VCU is a good school though. I know a couple of people who went there.

Orlando is another city that's only good for vacations.<br>  <br>  If you want to work in fashion, I definitely recommend NYC and LA; but these are also two of the most expensive cities.|`|LIJ8qnOVaa	DC is one of the places I will be going to this summer, I'm excited; I want to see all the memorial places!

I have also been to New York many times because I have many relatives there. Don't get me wrong it's good to vist but I wouldn't live there. Way to overpopulated, really expensive, over there you rent a studio apartment their for like 2,000 a month! It's insane for that price here in Arizona you pay 1,200 and you can have a huge brand new home with a pool and etc. Also the city is a dirty place, polluted and trash all over.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I reside in Arizona, I love it here, in most places it's more middle class suburb. My only complaint is the summer it can get as hot as 115-120 degrees.  But it's really beautiful.<br>  <br>  <br>  My best list:<br>  Niagara Falls,New York<br>  Nashville,Tennessee<br>  Evansville,Indiana<br>  Tombstone,Arizona<br>  <br>  <br>  Worst:<br>  New York City,New York<br>  Los Angles,California<br>  San Antonio,Texas|`|OZjlW5utaa	I live in Atlanta, contary to what people say, its not 'run' by blacks, black people are just the majority in most places here, and there are plenty of white people and latinos.

If you go into main Atlanta, it just gets very busy. <br>  <br>  Theres crime in every city, and their are run down parts in Atlanta, probably more then most but we're getting better so say in Bankhead/College Park/Vine city but my nan lives near there and she's fine, every city has its rough spots. Overall, Atlanta's great.<br>  <br>  Besides from that, I agree with you, and no offence to people who live in Detroit but it is pretty run down, from what I've heard and seen. But I would really recommend a South/North Eastern city like Pheonix or Portland which are accepting and have everything most North Eastern, Boston, NYC and DC are culturally diverse and some South Cities, like Houston or Atlanta.<br>  <br>  People who are saying ATL is worst, I said all cities have bad areas, and have any of you been to Atlanta?|`|r1BycC7Xaa	In my opinion LA is the worst city to live in.The air stinks.

I had the chance to go there last year and yes, i was surprised that there are almost no blacks there,  really nice place btw<br>  <br>  <br>  MAybe those areas are bad to you cause people treat you bad there, but they arent bad areas for others.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Using biblical clues combined with historic events, lots of people have come up with different answers.<br>  <br>  Initially the altar to the pagan god Zeus Olympius, set up in 168 B.C. by Antiochus Epiphanes (Flavius Josephus thought along those lines) and prefiguring a similar abomination that Jeusus predicted, namely, the Roman destruction of the temple in A.D. 70 and the setting up of an image of the anitchrist in Jerusalem.  (NIV Study Bible footnotes)<br>  <br>  According to Rev. George Croly's writings in 1827, it was the setting up of the papacy in A.D. 533. Adventist Uriah Smith (late 1800s), detailed how Napoleon Bonapart featured large in these prophecies. According to Charles Taze Russell, Napoleon did not regard the 'God of his fathers' - Roman Catholicism, nor 'the desire of women' - Protestantism. Napoleon worshipped military strength. According to Archibald Hughes in his 1958 book, the Jerusalem Temple became an abomination after Jesus' death and the rent veil. Jehovah's Witnesses today maintain that it was the desolation of Jerusalem by Roman armies in 70 A.D. and the last Jewish stronghold, Masada, falling in 73 A.D. with a future application with the 10 horns of a symbolic 'wild beast' desolating false religionists' operations - still future.<br>  <br>  Every generation, it seems, has had a go at interpreting that prophecy in light of modern events. The words are sealed up until the time of the end, Daniel was told, "and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand" (12:10). That means that anyone declaring its meaning today, then time going by and showing them to be in error, is a wicked person in God's estimation. The idea that it is the abomination of trusting in legalistic works has the merit of applying in every generation. Yet, how would that square with Daniel being told the revelation would take place at the end of a specified period of time? Intriguing!|`|H8WqMK1eaa	A preacher standing at the pulpit and telling his congregation they must follow the law in order to be saved....a preacher telling his flock that faith does not ensure salvation.|`|XSncvD4jaa	I'll tell you what Mormonism says it is. <br>  <br>  It's the time of total apostasy that would come over the church Christ established while on the earth. Satan would have power because there would no longer be a prophet of God with priesthood authority.<br>  Through time, since Adam, there have been prophets. <br>  There have been other times of God's people falling away, but never to this degree and never for so long did he remain in heaven. <br>  This is not to say that good people were personally abandoned by God. Many righteous people received spiritual inspirations. Non were chosen to build a church and restore the lost keys though until now.<br>  <br>  It's the dark ages (funny that even history knew that it was "dark").<br>  <br>  When God makes something spiritually desolate, it means that He has taken his word from the earth. No more spiritual water. No more of God's government upon the earth. It happened because of wickedness. They didn't want the living waters of the gospel and so it was taken. <br>  Revelation is a great book to compare with Daniel. It's all the same story/vision just a different prophet writing it. It's very cool how the truth is hidden in metaphors. I love it.<br>  The famine of hearing the word would not last forever and in time those keys would be restored and indeed have been. <br>  <br>  Just another perspective for consideration : )<br>  People should ask God if it is or isn't the truth. <br>  Only he is worthy to tell.

Not until Paul appeared on the scene, post crucifixion, was the new Gospel introduced to the gentiles. Jesus and the apostles could not have very well preached something that had not taken place and it was not the right time. There was no shed blood as yet. They were having trouble enough convincing.

wxBFZ41Taa	Not just the Gloria but the Alleluia as well.<br>  <br>  The Alleluia comes to us from Hebrew, and it means "praise Yahweh." Traditionally, it has been seen as the chief term of praise of the choirs of angels, as they worship around the throne of God in Heaven. It is, therefore, a term of great joy, and our use of the Alleluia during Mass is a way of participating in the angels' worship. It is also a reminder that the Kingdom of Heaven is already established on earth, in the form of the Church, and that our participation in Mass is a participation in Heaven.<br>  <br>  During Lent, however, our focus is on the Kingdom coming, not on the Kingdom having come. The readings in the Masses for Lent and in the Liturgy of the Hours focus heavily on the spiritual journey of Old Testament Israel toward the coming of Christ, and the salvation of mankind in His death and resurrection.<br>  <br>  We, too, are on a spiritual journey, toward the Second Coming and our future life in Heaven. In order to emphasize that journey, the Church, during Lent, removes the Alleluia from the Mass. We no longer sing with the choirs of angels; instead, we acknowledge our sins and practice repentance so that one day we may again have the privilege of worshiping God as the angels do.<br>  <br>  That day comes triumphantly on Easter Sunday—or, rather, at the Easter Vigil, on Holy Saturday night, when the priest chants a triple Alleluia before he reads the Gospel, and everyone present responds with a triple Alleluia. The Lord is risen; the Kingdom has come; our joy is complete; and, in concert with the angels and saints, we greet the risen Lord with shouts of "Alleluia!"<br>  <br>  The Goria is sung on Holy Thursday because it is actually the end of Lent. Most people think Lent ends on Easter, but it actually ends when the Triduum begins.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	I can answer the second question - strictly speaking Holy Thursday Mass begins the Triduum of Easter.<br>  <br>  Lent is a time of repentance, reflection and preparation for Christ's death and resurrection.  I think of it as a spiritual new year, even if it is not the new year according to the church calendar.  My only answer is that the Gloria is too joyful and happy to be sung during Lent.

czXaUPIlaa	The practice of Zen Buddhism cultivates wisdom, generosity, compassion, kindness, creativity and other qualities that help us live happier lives.<br>  <br>  To benefit from Zen, all you need to do is practice. And because Zen is not a belief system, no conversion is required.<br>  <br>  You are correct in your view that you can practice Zen while still honoring the traditions of your family. At my local Zen center, we have Christian, Muslim, and Jewish members, along with the usual agnostics, atheists, and confused types. Since Zen doesn't require that you adopt a belief system, you can live in harmony with those who have beliefs.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to practice Zen is by joining with others at a Zen center. Although it sounds unlikely, there might be a Zen center near you. Check out this list of Buddhist centers around the world - find your region and then narrow it down by searching on "zen".  <a href="http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/</a><br>  <br>  If no center exists locally, you can practice on your own. Frankly, this takes determination. Most people find Zen practice very easy to learn, but somewhat harder to sustain. But if you can sustain it, your life will flower in remarkable ways. <br>  <br>  Here's a short video that gives a very good description of how to practice:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyCrcpDs58" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyCrcpDs...</a><br>  <br>  I recommend that you practice every day, at the same time of the day and for the same amount of time. This stability will help you maintain your practice.<br>  <br>  Also, I recommend that you do a little reading every day, so that you can gain the support of the great teachers who have walked the path before you. Two classics are:<br>  "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" by Shunryu Suzuki, Roshi<br>  "Dropping Ashes on the Buddha" by Zen Master Seung Sahn<br>  <br>  Finally, you might check out "Taking the Path of Zen" by Robert Aitken, Roshi. It's a good guide to establishing a Zen practice.<br>  <br>  Best wishes on your path!|`|I1w0HfQbaa	You watch old Phil Jackson DVDs, coach of the Chicago Bull championship team from 1995-1998, because he teaches the way of Zen Buddhism.

The false teaching is that miracles are not for today, or that the baptism of the Holy spirit if not for today, or that tongues are not for today, etc.  They say there is only one baptism, but the Bible teaches clearly there are two (Luke 3:16).<br>  <br>  We need the gifts of the spirit today as much as ever and this false teaching is of the devil.|`|Z6TNsJluaa	It is rejected in most denominational Churches..I have talked with the Leaders in the Church of Christ doctrines, and they publicly said that being in tongues is of the devil..Still they have said this, they have witnessed to me that they have blasphemed the Holy Spirit by doing so..I also believe that those who speak against the works of the Holy Spirit will make the the Apostate Church governed by the one and only coming Antichrist!

I felt I couldn't even share what God had done for me!  I was looked at like I had grown another head!  They think tongues passed away with the "Perfection" of the Bible - at least that is what one Pastor told me.<br>  <br>  He said that it always causes division so he knew it wasn't of God.  this made no sense to me - because I thought, maybe Satan is the one causing division because he doesn't want that kind of effective prayer here.  It really opens up your prayer life and intimacy with God.<br>  <br>  It's not as traditional for Methodists - but they're cool with it and are supportive.<br>  <br>  I think it varies by denomination, but I feel led to stay in a church where it's not the norm, but they are open to it.<br>  <br>  I think most Charismatics stick together and I can surely understand why.<br>  <br>  Also, most Christians don't understand that there is a gift of tongues - for interpetation in the church (like Peter on the Day of Pentecost) and, separately, there is a prayer language that is given to believers when they are filled with His Spirit ..............two distinct gifts and people have them confused.|`|fmgPKOaraa	i think most churches don't regard speaking in tongues as being fundamental to salvation, so it isn't assigned any real importance. i doubt there is any church that actively forbids it, however, because it is a gift from God when it really occurs.

I can't say if it is more one than the other from personal experiences. But I have been in churches that do accept it and those that don't. <br>  <br>  Usually it is certain denominations that do not accept it. This is the Word of God being fulfilled. They have a form of Godliness, but deny the power thereof.<br>  <br>  Personally I am not aware of any church that forbids you the body to speak in tongue in the service and encourage them to only speak in tongues in private.<br>  <br>  As a child I was taught that speaking in tongues was the evidence of having the holy ghost. Now that I have matured I understand that this is not the truth. Tongues is a sign to the unbeliever. <br>  <br>  I Corinthian 14<br>     18I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:<br>  <br>     19Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.<br>  <br>     20Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.<br>  <br>     21In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.<br>  <br>     22Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe. <br>  <br>  Love is the true sign of having the Lord's spirit. <br>  <br>  The Bible plainly states the by this (love ) that the show that you are His disciples.<br>  <br>  John 13<br>    34A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<br>  <br>     35By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. <br>  <br>  God is a spirit. God is Love.<br>  <br>  Please keep in mind, I do not speak against tongues. Like Paul I speak more than many. But I also pray for an interpretation. I operate in the gifts as God ordains me to do. It is one spirit the operates all of the gifts. They all operaten by and through Love.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|ctOge9SLaa	Hello brother. <br>  I just praise the Lord that He has given gifts through the Spirit and that these gifts are for the building up and edification of the church.<br>  The church at Corinth was very rich in the gifts but immature in the Divine Life.  There was also division and preferences there. Some favour Apollos, others Cephas and others Paul. What strikes me is that even though they were so rich in the  many gifts of the Spirit, brother Paul was not able to speak to them, the solid food of the word, rather he had to offer them the milk, as babes ( 1 Cor 3:2).  <br>  <br>  So this shows that on the one hand, the churches cannot be negative regarding the various gifts of the Holy Spirit and at the same time they cannot neglect the proper growth and feeding in the word of God to mature and balance each saint.  If we are only pursuing the manifestation of the gifts but neglect our inner growth, then we will fall into the same trap that the saints at corinth fell into.<br>  <br>  Regarding the gift of speaking in tongues, we see this in the book of Acts first and what made this gift have its impact so much was the interpretation of it. Those who were dwelling in Jerusalem from other countries were able to hear their own dialect being spoken, the gospel of grace was being preached through this genuine flow of the Spirit upon and through the saints.<br>  <br>  Brother Paul is very clear in the word, this gift of the Spirit should NOT be forbidden, but with it should come the interpretation.  He also shared that if we just have the tongue, and not its interpretation then it makes the whole church seem confusing and if one who was unsaved were to be in their midst, he would think that the saints are all insane ( 1 Cor 14:23).  But if there were an interpreted tongue and moreso the prophesying that speaks for and forth God, done in an orderly fashion, where the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet, then this one would say that " God is in your midst" and fall upon his face and worship God ( vs 25).<br>  <br>  Today much abuse of this gift has taken place and saints have gone to the other extreme to band it all together.  This is not right, I cannot say that I want a person to be with me and tell that person that he cannot bring his hands or his ear.  When we receive a person, we receive that whole person.<br>  <br>  When we say that we receive the gifts of the Spirit, we receive ALL. We cannot pick and choose or say that it is for one dispensation or age of the church and not another.  <br>  <br>  Paul desired strongly that the saints seek the gifts of the SPirit, but mostly that the saints " desire earnestly " to Prophesy. Which is not necessarily only foretelling, but moreso to speak for God and speak forth God, to minister Christ in all His riches for the building up and edification of the Body as a whole.  We need to be constituted with the truths of God's word so that we can speak it for the building up of the Body of Christ and Prophesying is the most profitable excellent one to accomplish this.<br>  1 Cor 14:1<br>   Pursue love, and desire earnestly the spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Too often, tongues without the interpretation edifies only the spirit of the speaker, it does not build up the Body, and once we are gathered together as the church, the most important thing is that the church is Built up.<br>  1 Cor 12:26<br>  What then brothers? Whenever you come together, EACH ONE HAS a psalm, has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue, has an interpretation, Let all things be done for building up.<br>  <br>  With tongues there should always be the " interpretation' since its the interpretation that is understood and edifying and in the end, builds up the Body of Christ.<br>  <br>  May the Lord truly be the Head of His Church. He said that He will build His Church and as His many members who are gifted by the same Spirit, we need to treasure all that Christ has afforded us. May our gifts never be used for our own personal gain. Spirituality is indeed a BODY matter.  The Lord is not after spiritiual giants.. He wants us to " all arrive" at the oneness of the Faith as a grown man and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ( Eph 4:13).  He alone is the head, the rest is the Body.  May we all care for the Body, treasure the function of the many members and in the end, stay within the principle of the Body where we all depend on one another and hold to the Head, may the Lord have fellow workers and members of His body who lay aside their own agendas and preferences and desire what HE desires..

Many churches will have nothing to do with anyone who claims to speak in tongues, and others claim you must speak in tongues if your saved.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is because speaking in tongues is greatly mis-understood in most churches.  The reason it is mis-understood is because people will take one or two verses and try to base their whole doctrine on those verses.<br>  <br>  A proper understanding of "tongues" can only be reached by a complete understanding of Church History, Biblical use of the word "tongues", and Bible land customs.<br>  <br>  When this is reached, the Bible student will realize that there are two types of "tongeus" used in the Bible.  The First is when the Apostles spoke in an earthly language that they did not know.  God did this for two reasons.  First, so the disciples could preach the gospel to people of other languages.  This "tongues" was not really speaking in different languages, but it was each person "hearing" them speak in each language.  It would have been impossible for them to simotaniously speak in all those different languages, but God allowed the hears to hear the message in their own language.  Then later, they literally spoke to different groups in their native language. <br>  <br>  After the Gospel was preached, taught, and salvation had arrived to people of different groups, there was no need for this "gift" any longer.<br>  <br>  The second use of the word "tongues" is in relation to speaking in church.  This tongues was always refered to as a "known language".  This tongues speaking was nothing more then someone preaching or teaching in a different language then those who was hearing it.  They were not to do this unless someone was there to interpret what they were saying.  This would be like me going to a spanish church and preaching.  It would not profit anyone, unless someone was there to interpret what I was saying.<br>  <br>  Tongues as practiced today was never the issue in early church history.  There is not one single reference to todays tongue usage in early church writings. <br>  <br>  Today, there are many examples of people preaching in languages unknown to the listener in Church.  However, they have someone to interpret it.<br>  <br>  There is also a few examples of God allowing His missionaries to speak in an unknown language in order to communicate the Gospel to a tribe of people who they could not normally communicate with.  This is rare, but not completely uncommon.<br>  <br>  Biblically sound churches understand these things and do not allow "todays version" of speaking in tongues within the church.  Some say that if you do it in your personal life, that is your busness, but not in church.  Some go as far as to say that if you speak in "todays tongue" at all, then you can not be a member of the church.<br>  <br>  A few churchs allow todays version of speaking in tongues within their walls, but do not push the subject, and a small few go as far as to say you must speak in "tongues" to be saved. <br>  <br>  I hope this "brief" discription of "tongues" help some of you to understand this.|`|vciEtUcPaa	I don't know about every church,but I know that some denominations forbid the speaking in other tongues.It's wrong and the christians that both forbid it and doesn't practice it are missing out on a tremendous blessing in their lives.A part of the Body of Christ is being robbed of being all that they can be.Also they are robbing God of the glory due to Him through the operation of these gifts.I encourage every christian out there to open up and see what God has for them!|`|5LP8FyzAaa	At Pentecost, speaking in tongues was described in detail. Nowhere did it ever state that one is to babble nonsense. An example of speaking in tongues is when one, all of a sudden, starts speaking in anothers [discernable] language. A lot of people have twisted this whole concept. And for those that claim they speak in the angelic language, I say bullsh*t. Because Hebrew is the language of angels and is still discernable.|`|AA11613315	The church where I'm going now, it's totally accepted.  In fact, the pastor gave a word in a tongue yesterday.  It was awesome!<br>  In the church I left a couple of months ago, the pastor would get up in front and preach a sermon on how it IS a valid gift and how if anyone in the congregation felt moved to give a word then by all means do so.  HOWEVER, when one of the congregants (um, that would be me) got prayed over in a small group, received the Holy Spirit and started speaking in tongues he went ballistic about it as soon as he heard about it (yes, I know this opens up the whole question of why he wasn't overseeing what went on in the small group, but according to him he didn't feel the need.  He felt that he was of a like mind with the leaders and even told the leaders before they started that he believed in it). <br>  Well, he ripped the leaders a new rear end and told them that they "coached" me (they did not!!) and "brainwashed" me (um what??) and that it was of the devil etc etc etc.<br>  There were a whole host of other "issues" involved, but needless to say, I left that church.|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	The Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement is the fastest growing segment of the Church World Wide surpassing even the growth of Islam. It is also the largest segment of the Church World Wide. The largest single Churches in the World are Pentecostal Churches, (not Denominations but single Churches). And, the largest, and fastest growing Protestant Denominations are Pentecostal. (Quoting David Barrett, a leading expert of Religious Statics.) Pentecostalism in all it's various forms  exceeds 400 Million People. It is the largest non Catholic grouping accounting for one in every four Christians.<br>  <br>  Is the Charismatic/Pentecostal Movement rejected in many Churches/Denominations ? Yes. But that is becoming less the norm as even Denominations that were not Traditionally Pentecostal begin to experience Pentecost. Churches/Denominations which have historically denounced the Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement are loosing membership World Wide while Churches/Denominations that are either Traditional Pentecostal, Charismatic, or who are now embracing the Movement are gaining membership World Wide.

An Assembly of God church I once attended, forbid it because they did not want to offend anyone.  They were in the process of getting Seeker friendly.  Another church I attended never spoke of it at all, believing it was a private matter. They did not even teach of it.  I was a new Christian then, and had attended there for 6 years.   I have visited many churches and the majority do not recognize or practice this wonderful gift the Lord has given us.<br>  I think it's rejected because a person's natural mind cannot explain or grasp the heavenly language God blesses us with.  <br>  Open the eyes of our heart, Lord.<br>  Blessings.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	The supremacy of the Roman bishop (the papacy) was created with the support of the Roman emperors. With the city of Rome being the center of government for the Roman empire, and with the Roman emperors living in Rome, the city of Rome rose to prominence in all facets of life. Constantine, and his successors, gave their support to the bishop of Rome as the supreme ruler of the church. Of course it is best for the unity of the Roman empire that the government and state religion be centered in the same location. While most other bishops (and Christians) resisted the idea of the Roman bishop being supreme, the Roman bishop eventually rose to supremacy, due to the power and influence of the Roman emperors. When the Roman empire collapsed, the popes took on the title that had previously belonged to the Roman emperors – Pontificus Maximus.|`|CueEJOVFaa	Depending on the way that you read church history, the pope didn't have more power at the time of Constantine; he just had the seat of honor.|`|AA11227341	based on what I have read, it was not that he--the pope had the power but this would allow the king to really know what his faithfuls were thinking or doing (the practice of confession) so when people went in for confession (which no other religious group holds) the pope would take the "juicy" gossip to the king who in turn knew what was happening in his kingdom, who was sinning with whom, etc.  <br>  Let me suggest this--stop by a Christian book store and ask for a book or any written material by Dr. Alberto Ramirez--he was a priest and he has some very, very interesting information on the RCC that will shake your mind.   enjoy.  very wow!|`|fOfJz9OMaa	We need to understand that Constantine was not only a ruler, but a politician; and politicians have always been the same, looking for their advantage.  What so-called official history does not record, is that an agreement and unity of purpose was made between the overseers of the church at that time, who were weary of persecution, and of having Christianity outlawed; but at the same time, the politician Constantine was receiving taxation from basically the local populations.  The overseers and Constantine invented Constantine′s acceptance of Christianity in exchange for loyalty to the state by the Christians, which were many, and also which the overseers guaranteed, because the Christian population were very submissive to the overseers at the time; and this included the overseers place in great authority over the church by the state.  This compromise remains till this day, which is why there is only a very small remnant that is truly following Christ, and the rest are following a secular invented church for this world′s show or appearance, by which politicians can justify themselves.|`|z74a7wvlaa	There are 37 popes/lineage of St Peter and the Catholic Church is already in placed when Emperor Constantine came around 300ad.<br>  <br>  The List of Popes<br>  St. Peter (32-67) St. Linus (67-76) St. Anacletus (Cletus) (76-88) St. Clement I (88-97) St. Evaristus (97-105) St. Alexander I (105-115) St. Sixtus I (115-125) St. Telesphorus (125-136) St. Hyginus (136-140) St. Pius I (140-155) St. Anicetus (155-166) St. Soter (166-175) St. Eleutherius (175-189) St. Victor I (189-199) St. Zephyrinus (199-217) <br>  St. Callistus I (217-22) St. Urban I (222-30) St. Pontain (230-35) St. Anterus (235-36) St. Fabian (236-50) St. Cornelius (251-53) St. Lucius I (253-54) St. Stephen I (254-257) St. Sixtus II (257-258) St. Dionysius (260-268) St. Felix I (269-274) St. Eutychian (275-283) St. Caius (283-296) St. Marcellinus (296-304) St. Marcellus I (308-309) St. Eusebius (309 or 310) St. Miltiades (311-14) St. Sylvester I (314-35) St. Marcus (336) St. Julius I (337-52) Liberius (352-66) St. Damasus I (366-83) <br>  <br>  St Peter is known First of equal = supreme apostle and no one question that since day 1 and up to now.

8jhACvtlaa	Have you been perusing about the anti-LDS sites?  ;)  <br>  <br>  The time period of the Book of Mormon is from the Tower of Babel in the OT (thousands of years BEFORE Christ) to about 400 years after Christ, in a location that remains exactly unknown for sure, even though hypotheses have been made.  So, these places mentioned are more on the order of Thousands of years, not just hundreds.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The places mentioned in the history of the LDS church are naturally easily known and still exist today (Joseph Smith being born in 1805 and the Church being restored in 1830).  The places mentioned in the Book of Mormon, do not.  There is a difference.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the second question, why there are so many Mormons...?

I dont know what the heck your talking about that not one artifact have been found. Scholars have proved civilizations did exist all throughout those times and have found temples, weapons, etc. but the debate is that they haven't found metal swords as described in the BoM and they dont believe horses were populated till the spaniards brought them. The thing you have to realize is that science always changes and what people think is the correct theory will always change in the future, happened all throughout history. Did you know that scientists are debating how accurate the "method" which dates bones and rocks is because new research shows certain past calculations failed to add up correctly. My personal belief is that the BoM will never be proven by science but by faith in Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father can do anything by the say of his word and he could hide this whole civilization in a wink of an eye if thats what he saw was for best. I've read the book and if your even close to honest with yourself then you will realize joseph was inspired by some outside force to write this, especially for having a third grade reading education proven by his hand written letters.

Regardless, if we look at the archeological evidence for the Bible it is overwhelming that the people and places existed.

Look closer.<br>  <br>  But the specific evidence found does not match with the Book of Mormon at all. BoM mentions steel weapons and chariots. None are found. Not even methods of creating steel is found. Instead, we find lots of flint and stone weapons. The BoM mentions animals like elephants, horses, and monkeys. Animal remains are found, but not these animals. The BoM mentions crops like wheat and barley. What is found is evidence of corn and squash. The BoM mentions specific coins, but there is no evidence found for metal coins. The BoM mentions people groups. There is no outside writings mentioning these people groups. <br>  <br>  So the evidence is all wrong for the Book of Mormon. <br>  <br>  So, to answer the question - they have a "blind faith".

wVet0QXVaa	We think that God is patient enough to plan in advance.  Besides, you can talk to people about God while you are in the process of converting and learning.  I would say there are a huge number of differences between Paul's time and ours.<br>  <br>  We like to have as many well educated members as possible and we want people to really know their faith.  It takes 5-7 years to become a priest because we want them to be able to read the original languages of the Bible and really know what they are talking about.  Try to read Chaucer in middle English without any guides or aids which help you to understand for an example of why we don't just hand people Bibles and tell them that they are now priests.  There's a lot to the Bible and we want people to really speak the truth when they preach, not to just do their very best.  We really think it matters.|`|AA11382947	Paul received the Holy Spirit in a flash of light direct from God.<br>  <br>  If you do the same, you would be saved in that instant.<br>  <br>  Now, it does not take a year and a half, RCIA class starts in the fall and you become an official member of the Catholic at Easter, more like 6 months.

Less than a year.<br>  <br>  Children who are confirmed have been learning the faith since they were little. They make their profession of faith and are sealed with the Holy Spirit at their confirmation. The start of "confirmation classes and the resulting confirmation day" take about 4 months. <br>  <br>  Whoever told you it take a year and a half, doesn't know what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  But even if it did, I don't think we can decide how long God can wait or not wait. Only God knows, and his timing is always perfect.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	it actually takes around 8-9 months for the RCIA Classes. We are supposed to preach always. Those new to the Catholic Faith can share with others what they are learning as they are learning the teachings of the Catholic Church. They do not have to wait to become full members of the Catholic Church. Before my husband took any formal RCIA classes, I was teaching him about the Catholic Church for about 6 months or so and he shared with others what he was learning.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	You don't you become a Catholic but need educated on the Sacraments.<br>  Each person is to examine themselves before partaking in the bread.<br>  You need to follow understand the dogma of faith.<br>  You are accepted in but can't partake in the Eucharist, you can attend Mass as a member of the Church.|`|HMteUyRdaa	The waiting time is a time of learning what the faith is all about.

You need to stop idolizing St.Paul so much.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|z74a7wvlaa	If one is being called to be a catholic, don't even wait for RCIA to start; Demonstrate thru good deeds your intention and the Holy Ghost will take care of the rest. Jesus taught his apostles and followers within 3 yrs of his life. To follow Jesus is to learn his ways; e.g. the royal catholic priesthood takes 8 yrs [correct me] to be so called 'authorized to administer the ways of Jesus. WE do not operate like the evangelical or pentecostal that goes thru a 3weeks crash course and start the theatrical ranting and ask for MONEY. <br>  So, do the work as soon as the call is there.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	We evangelize more by the people  we are rather than preaching a bunch of scripture at people.   Evangelization can be done from the time you are young.   We are taught to love our neighbor, to feed the poor, to help others...those are all types of evangelization...because the good that we do gives glory to God...it is our love toward our fellow man that shows who we are.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself...who are you more likely to believe...a person who comes to you and loves you where you are, and helps you or someone who tells you that your are hellbound and going to burn in a lake of fire.   Jesus, never went around condemning people.   He showed them that he loved them....right where they were at that moment.   He didn't expect them to change right away but by his love for them, and the tenderness he showed them...their hearts became changed.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Paul did not care how he attracted his suckers, only that they come. The Catholic (original) Church wants people to make an informed decision and to learn the religion and philosophy before joining.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	Confirmation is not conversion, you can convert right now, you don't necessarily need to be confirmed. You see, confirmation is just to confirm yourself totally to the faith, and is a promise to God to stay a Catholic.

KILFoc6kaa	Loved it, bought the Fireproof Book, and Love Dare book and our own copy of the movie.  My husband and I have been married for 7 years and it touched our marriage so much.  We are both Christians, but we certainly aren't perfect and it opened our eyes to a lot of things in our marriage that we needed to change. We now have purchased the movie and books for a few young couples we know whom are about to get married, and a couple whom is having a lot of troubles in their marriage.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	It was awesome!!  (I had my son watch it because he is having problems in his marriage.)|`|TzY9vkinaa	I LOOOOOOVED it. My Husband and I just got married, watching Fireproof was a good way to start out our first week of marriage. We plan to have a forever marriage, and this movie taught us a thing or two on how to make that happen.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	I saw it when it came out in the theaters.<br>  <br>  I thought it was pretty good for a Christian movie. They never have near the budget that Hollywood productions do, and it shows.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, it was a good story. It's refreshing to see a depiction of a couple's marriage being restored instead of the usual cheating and divorce scenario. <br>  <br>  I thought the love dare book was pretty cool, but I knew from the very moment it was introduced in the movie that it would start showing up in Christian bookstores. I resist the idea of such commercialization of things like that, as well as the near automatic consumption of these products by the Christian community.<br>  <br>  Anyway, God is able to draw a straight line with a crooked stick. Perhaps he'll use that book to help and save a lot of marriages.|`|7e2dad446deb31af0e15a02d4e75fc9caa	I could not wait for the movie to come out.

I own all 3 of their movies and am ready for a 4th!!!|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	It made sence I was glad to see that he kissed his won wife and I thought he was a bit tearful int he end, but I grew up with a bunch of ice cold men so what can I say, I need to read the companion book that goes with the movie, I am not so good with repsecting my husband.|`|c9fWiIlVaa	I seen it and absolutely loved it. I feel like I learned a lot from the movie. Even though I am only 17 I can use this to help my future marriage. It is helping my mom and stepdad with theirs. This movie sends a powerful message that with God we can do anything and save a seemingly ended marriage.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	I saw it with my wife. It's a great movie with a good message: broken things can be fixed if we are willing and teachable, and ready to put forth the effort. It hits home with me right now in several ways. I hope for the best, but I will trust God and stay in the word and pray and be as obedient as I can according to the strength given to me. I still fall short of what I hope for, but I know my Redeemer lives, and I know His plans for me are plans for good and not for evil. Jesus is all my rightousness and strength. Please pray for me. Thx.|`|wSYYfBK4aa	It was a touching story of homosexual love, two men who refused to let Christian bigotry keep them from enjoying their forbidden passions.

msNXomjTaa	As humans, we have a knowledge that there is something out there that is beyond us. However, God/Creator/Whatever is beyond human understanding.  So, we create understandings, based on revelation and experience.  One person or group of people understands in one way, and another group in another way.  These different views become religions.<br>  <br>  An athiest would suggest that we need to invent religions, to blame something else for our lives, or at least give meaning to them.  I disagree; I think something is out there/in here, but beyond our full comprehension.  We do our best, and most religions have a lot of commonality in them, but there are certainly differences.  <br>  <br>  The famous example is the one about a group of people trying to describe an elephant.  One says it is like a snake (the trunk), or a tree (the leg) or a frayed rope (the tail).  All are right, but none are complete.|`|TBZK5q78aa	Everyone has their own interpretation of what God wants.

It includes a system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices; these may be personal, or they may be advocated by an organization. Usually religion involves belief in God or in a number of gods; or it treats humans, objects, desires, or forces as objects of worship. Much religion is based on human study of nature; there is also revealed religion. There is true religion and false.<br>  <br>  Why are there so many religions?<br>  <br>  A recent tabulation concluded that there are 10 main religions and some 10,000 sects. Of these, some 6,000 exist in Africa, 1,200 in the United States, and hundreds in other lands.<br>  <br>  Many factors have contributed to the development of new religious groups. Some have said that the various religions all represent different ways of presenting religious truth. But a comparison of their teachings and practices with the Bible indicates, rather, that the diversity of religions is because people have become followers of men instead of listening to God. It is noteworthy that, to a large extent, teachings they hold in common, but that differ from the Bible, originated in ancient Babylon. (See pages 50, 51, under the heading “Babylon the Great.”)<br>  <br>  Who is the instigator of such religious confusion? The Bible identifies Satan the Devil as “the god of this system of things.” (2?Cor. 4:4) It warns us that “the things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God.” (1?Cor. 10:20) How vitally important, then, to make sure that we really are worshiping the true God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and that our worship is pleasing to him!<br>  <br>  Are all religions acceptable to God?<br>  <br>  Judg. 10:6,?7: “The sons of Israel again proceeded to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and they began to serve the Baals and the Ashtoreth images and the gods of Syria and the gods of Sidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the sons of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines. So they left Jehovah and did not serve him. At this Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel.” (If a person worships any thing or any person other than the true God, the Creator of heaven and earth, it is evident that his form of worship is not acceptable to Jehovah.)<br>  <br>  Mark 7:6,?7: “He [Jesus] said to them [the Jewish Pharisees and scribes]: ‘Isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites, as it is written, “This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach as doctrines commands of men.”’” (Regardless of whom a group profess to worship, if they hold to doctrines of men instead of the inspired Word of God, their worship is in vain.)<br>  <br>  Rom. 10:2,?3: “I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge; for, because of not knowing the righteousness of God but seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.” (People may have God’s written Word but lack accurate knowledge of what it contains, because they have not been taught properly. They may feel that they are zealous for God, but they may not be doing what he requires. Their worship is not going to please God, is it?)<br>  <br>  www.watchtower.org|`|5Z5RzKpmaa	Religion exists as a way of connecting with the Divine.

If they are "Christians", then I want nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  The people I know believe they can do no wrong just because they are Christians and have been saved.<br>  <br>  So no matter what they do, it is right, they are right and everything is just peachy keen.<br>  <br>  These people are incredibly snobbish about it, truly believe they are better than everyone else.  They lie, cheat, steal and cause trouble for others and truly believe they are totally innocent of any wrongdoing just because they go to church every week.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, these are the minority, not the majority (I think and hope).  But these are the ones who keep me away from churches, because I just can't tolerate a hypocrite.|`|52gVSg9jaa	Anyone needing a religion to define their behavior is going to be weak minded enough to believe what they are told.<br>  Religion needs fear to contain the people, just as government in any form needs to be able to focus attention away from the real issues of who is sticking their heads up while praying, or working, or thinking.<br>  Tolerance of others is a recipe for everyone having a chance to speak, on equal ground. Just as dangerous for the religion as it is for the government.|`|9pXeC0EGaa	I think one Rev Soleil once said. "Ever notice how God seems to hate the same people believers do?" <br>  Damn straight it's an excuse. It's a lazy arrsed excuse to not consciously check in with yourself and reflect on your own prejudices.|`|Znr4j94Daa	Ok, I understand what you mean but not everyone uses religion for that purpose.

Religion, in cases like this, is similar to race; there's not enough to go around, we're going to pick an arbitrary group to exclude/exile/exterminate so there will be fewer mouths to feed. Religion isn't any more to blame for this religious intolerance than race is to blame for racism.<br>  <br>  In developed countries, where everyone has everything they need anyway, religious intolerance is a reflection of the inherent human "fear of the unknown", fear of "others". Religion itself has that idea built into it, but I think religion probably just reflects that idea.|`|8pQrIL90aa	Christianity has very little religion within it, but the bulk of religions are ways the enemy confounds the minds of men by giving them several paths to take to cover over the one true path of light. We could tolerate the pagans, but sure as we live as it is written in the bible they will be roused by their ungodly spirit who motivates their hearts and all peace would collapse. <br>  <br>  There shall be no peace on this earth long as the tempter lives.|`|AA11924289	i would say it is both. intolerant behaviour can influence religion and then religion can be used to excuse intolerant behaviour<br>  <br>  but i would have thought that relgions preached love and as such followers should not be intolerant. so i would say it is people who are intolerant use religion to justify it.<br>  <br>  but peoples intolerant behaviour has in some cases seeped into religion so the lines are blurred|`|AA10024451	It depends on what you're referring to them being "intolerant" of. If it's something that God has clearly condemned in the Bible, i.e. drunkeness, adultery, murder, homosexuality.......then we are rightfully intolerant of those kinds of things the way God is. <br>  <br>  Don't try and make intolerance of sinful behavior as something bad.

AA11440601	Of course.<br>  <br>  The Orthodox and Catholic Churches were one and the same until they separated from one another in 1054 mainly over the role of the Pope.<br>  <br>  There are very few theological differences. The main difference is that the Orthodox Churches (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11329a.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11329a.h...</a> use the Byzantine Rite (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04312d.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04312d.h...</a> and the Catholic Church use the Roman or Latin Rite.<br>  <br>  Pope John Paul II said of the Orthodox Churches in Orientale Lumen, "A particularly close link already binds us. We have almost everything in common." <br>  <br>  For the entire document, see: <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_02051995_orientale-lumen_en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_p...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|B6r56Nr7aa	They both are in communion with each other and date back to the time of the Apsotles. :D|`|C0xGFq2Qaa	OMG, in the interest of historical fact, the prior answer is almost laughable.<br>  First of all, the Partriarchs were never a solid group to begin with.<br>  Here's how it works.  Way back before jesus, the only similar religion that exists and was in conformity with "Christian" belief of the time was the Judaism of the Hebrews.<br>  Jesus came and started a Church.  Peter and the apostles continued this church and it was the Catholic Church of Rome.  Yes, Peter and Paul both went to the actual city of Rome and made it the capitol of the Church.  In the 5th or 6th century the Eastern and Western Roman empires split and with it, the Catholic Church.  This split has maintained until the modern day so we have the Western Church which we call the "Holy Roman Catholic Church" and then the many Eastern Orthodoxs.  The primary difference is in belief of the Pope as the head, but both are "Catholic" in the fullest sense of the term.<br>  <br>  Now to the Patriarchs. They were a group of the heads of the prime religions in selecting the works which were holy and inspired.  These were the heads of the Jewish Church and the Roman Church, which was unsplit at the time.  The met and agreed on Old Testament books which both religions are in agreement upon. (We still use the same books they chose at that time and it became the Catholic Canon of books).  The Jewish leaders then departed and the Catholic leaders selected the works which would comprise the New Testament of the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Creed and Alexandria "tamperings" referred to were with the Council of Nicaea with the writing of the Nicaean Creed.  The Leaders of the Catholic Church met and formed wrote the Creed so that the entire Church would function as a single body.  The problem is that there were Arian Heretics among the Bishops.  This was not a secret sect by any means.  The Arians were a clear division from the Church stood opposite the Roman Church.  While the Arians were around, they were the biggest threat to the Catholic Church up to that time.  The revisions of the Creed mentioned (which took place in the 4th and 5th centuries, not 1054 or some other random date) were aimed directly at countering the Arian movement, which it eventually managed to do.|`|XwuZYLg1aa	Yes.

jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,<br>  <br>  If you are interested about learning Wicca and/or Witchcraft here are a few legitimate sources to glean knowledge from. One being Witchvox at <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/.</a> Here you will gain knowledge through fellowship with other of like mind and knowledge through the countless articles posted. If this is not enough one could look into getting online training through the Sacred Mists at <a href="http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour..." rel="nofollow">http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour...</a> or OZ Wicca at <a href="http://www.ozwicca.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ozwicca.com/</a> , both are pretty decent for learning the Craft on the Web.<br>  <br>  Also if you are close enough to a group that specializes in education and development like the SCWF try and join them even if it’s on a limited capacity. Ultimately, study, study and then study some more. Find all you can and definitely cross reference whenever possible, this way you can get the best out of all you learn.<br>  <br>  I also suggest that you get your hands on Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin and/or The Circle Within by Dianne Sylvan. Both of these books are very good reading and both will give you some deeper insight to the Craft and how it relates to you. Also you cannot go wrong with anything by Scott Cunningham.<br>  <br>  If you are teen, I suggest Teen Witch by Silver Ravenwolf and Elements of Witchcraft: Natural Magick for Teens by Ellen Dugan.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|v14DyoP5aa	Read a b-o-o-k.

In that time, aside from reading about it, you could join a Wiccan egroup/chat group or two to discuss Wiccan related subjects with others studying and/or following the religion - search Yahoo groups and MSN groups - there are a ton out there, as well as you could look into workshops and classes at your local metaphysical shop.<br>  <br>  The Witches Voice is another site that is good to bookmark when studying Wicca - there are lots of articles you could poke through to see various viewpoints.

I'll echo what others have said - there are many things more powerful than me. But even if there weren't I don't find any reason that there should be. There just isn't any reason there has to be some all powerful or great being controlling out universe. It really doesn't make any sense at all to think there is something "bigger" or "greater" than us, I think it is just comforting to some. <br>  <br>  I'm an atheist because it is very logical to me.|`|uUCTem2Eaa	No, I readily acknowledge that a number of things (such as the Sun) are way more powerful than I could ever imagine being.<br>  <br>  I just think it's impossible for anything omnipotent to exist, because this creates so many conundrums.|`|AA11058044	Even a cursory perusal of your standard porn film can verify the existence of many things more powerful than mine.<br>  <br>  Perhaps this means that Ron Jeremy is god?|`|IqqaA2wIaa	im not and for those who are willingly seeking with an open mind can make you find God along with prayers.....He isnt going to slap you or forve you....You have to want eternal life and love Him back....|`|283tO9j9aa	Nope. I'm an atheist because:<br>  <br>  - There isn't any evidence for gods<br>  - I was never introduced to the concept of gods when I was young- at least, not until I started school- and so I never really understood it much<br>  - If we're really so important to this God fella, how come we can only live on a small proportion of one rocky planet? We can't get to any other planets like ours so there's nowhere else for us to live. Nice way of showing us how special we are. And that's the opposite of the question.<br>  - A loving deity would not allow suffering in the world, let alone behave in the way the god of the Old Testament does. If there is a god it is either malicious or indifferent, so I wouldn't worship it anyway.<br>  <br>  I don't think there's any truth in that statement at all, certainly not for me. I think that going round saying that some sky dude is looking after you because you're special and follow his special rules is much more arrogant than assuming we're just here and there ain't much you can do about it.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	I look at it this way,  all religions and gods are creations by a human at some point in human history.<br>  <br>  They are all equal mythology.<br>  <br>  I have no issue with someone who chooses one of these and says this is my faith and my religion.<br>  <br>  My issue is I want a secular society,  where people aren't passing law or having pubilc schools be teaching grounds for these "religions",  theres a benefit to the reilgious minority with this kind of society.<br>  <br>  I think the question was posed to Christians who want to ban gay marriage what if there was a muslim majority in this country and they wanted all the women to wear burkas.  <br>  <br>  The "theocracy" is really control of one denomination over the others.<br>  <br>  Anyhow,<br>  <br>  a lot of atheists will tell you "there is no evidence for god",  or "after examining the evidence" or something like that.<br>  <br>  We don't need to look any further than "historically all religions were invented by a person",  <br>  <br>  not all religions are cults,  some are just people who want to believe|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I'm not powerful at all.

dmTVbpcWaa	This statement of yours " I do however have a preferred interest in the JW movement." is being disingenuous. You have a Vitriolic contempt for  the Witnesses, and that is Plain to see from every comment you have posted about the JW.<br>   Perhaps you and your ilk could spend more time examining your own beliefs on unbiblical teachings. For instance although the exact details are lost in the mists of antiquity, indications are that by 336?C.E., a form of Christmas was being celebrated by the Roman church. “The date of Christmas was purposely fixed on December 25,” explains The New Encyclopedia Britannica, “to push into the background the great festival of the sun god.” That was when pagans indulged in orgies during the festivals of both the Roman Saturnalia and the Celtic and German feast of winter solstice. The New Caxton Encyclopedia says that “the Church seized the opportunity to Christianize these festivals.”<br>   So are we of the Mind that a Little Paganism in our worship does not hurt anyone?<br>  <br>  *** Yes JW did celebrate Christmas at one time- But they were keen enough to see the error in that Celebration- and Changed. The Apostle Paul before becoming an Apostle and the Man that was Used Mightily by the Christ, was in error as well.- but my point still stands. I have seen your posts before so dont kid yourself in saying what you saying, none of your posts have ever been Positive- not that it makes a difference to me or others but as they say-. It is what it is.<br>  What's bred in the bone will come out in the flesh.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Hate is a strong word.

They have continued to keep to the fore in their thinking the counsel given by Jesus: “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.”—Matt. 24:42.<br>  <br>  After the prophet Jonah was vomited by a big fish, he went on to prophesying to Nineveh that forty days are left it will be destroyed.  It did not come due to a certain reason, but it does not make the prophet Jonah a false one.<br>  <br>  Nathan the prophet encouraged King David to go ahead with what was in his heart regarding the building of a house for Jehovah’s worship. But later Jehovah told Nathan to inform David that he was not the one who would build it. Jehovah did not reject Nathan for what he had said earlier but continued to use him because he humbly corrected the matter when Jehovah made it plain to him.—1?Chron. 17:1-4, 15.<br>  <br>  The apostles of Jesus Christ, they have at times had some wrong expectations.—Luke 19:11; John 21:22,?23; Acts 1:6,?7.<br>  <br>  True prophets and the false can be recognized by the fruitage manifest in their lives and the lives of those who follow them<br>  <br>  Matt. 7:15-20: “Be on the watch for the false prophets that come to you in sheep’s covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will recognize them. .?.?. Every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit .?.?. Really, then, by their fruits you will recognize those men.”<br>  <br>  JWs, as you may have known, are very zealous in sharing the good news of the kingdom.  Though they are not paid, they are very active in this ministry because they do it out of love for Jehovah and others.  They are neutral to political rifts and opted not to enlist themselves to military list so they will not come into situation of killing others in war.  (Matthew 6:15, John 13:35).  Though neutral, they honestly pay taxes (Romans 13:1) and submissive to higher authority, but more submissive to God (Acts 5:29).<br>  <br>  Factor to consider regarding the teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses is this: Have these truly uplifted people morally? Are those who adhere to these teachings outstanding in their communities because of their honesty? Is their family life beneficially influenced by applying these teachings? Jesus said that his disciples would be readily identified because of having love among themselves. (John 13:35) Is this quality outstanding among Jehovah’s Witnesses?

In other words living things come from non living matter. This is poor science at best mythological at best, and directly in opposition to the creation account in the Genesis 1. We are talking about  *historical* differences. You cannot equate them together. You do not want to sacrifice disagreeing with a particular group on the altar of "can't all views be equal and the same".

spbqfjvbaa	Absolutely.  If FOTF can protest the "homosexual agenda" (boycotting comapnies like Campbells, Pespi & Disney), as well as be pro family by not only being anti gay marriage, but anti civil union/domestic partnership?  Sure, the gays can protest outside their HQs.    It's within the 1st amendment rights of freedom of speech.<br>  <br>  They protested against me & my friends with their lies about Prop 8 by helping contribute to the cause.  How are they being "pro-family" if their agenda is helping to make it more difficult for me to provide benefits (without being taxed on them)for my wife & kids (last time I checked, they are indeed a family!) ?  <br>  <br>  If people don't conform to what FOTF believes in,  they protest against us.  So, why can't we then protest against them?  Or even better, why try to "help" people change & just accept them as they are?

But if you truly seek God/truth - God will reveal Himself to you.  Your questions get less flaky as you persist in your search. I remember some a while back that were "inconceivable", do you remember ? Edit: Now there's an arrogant premise - if you are unable to understand it -it really doesn't exist.  Ha!  Tell me ALL that you know about the cosmos ... and hey, make it understandable, huh  ? Edit: That's one way of ducking my question - I was waiting for a brilliant expose of the cosmos since "it" is your specialty. Let's hear or is it just theoretical nonsense ? Edit So the only thing that is real in your mind is something that can be reduced to a bumper sticker slogan or a 30 second TV commercial ?  You have already made up your mind that no mater what someone says that unless they hold YOUR position that it is wrong. Let's go back to the original question then.

Maybe the answer lies in the right-wing (and therefore, presumable, at least some Christian) support for Corporate person-hood.

A ration being having an intellect.  Thus, the quality of personhood is predicated of the Trinity, Angels, Humans, and if intelligent aliens show up in a few years, them too.<br>  <br>  No, when we speak of protecting fetuses, we speak in defense of Human Life.  Personhood is a quality and doesn't need protecting.  That, and definitions of "personhood" change and get distorted when you talk with secularists.

gNK8clF8aa	That's a big question! :-)<br>  I made a website to try and start explaining that at bit; you may want to check out <a href="http://www.viewonbuddhism.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.viewonbuddhism.org.</a><br>  <br>  However, you may be warned, as it can be a bit confusing in the very beginning. There are a fair number of things that are unfamiliar for the average westerner; subjects like karma, rebirth, meditation, selflessness to name but a few. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, during over 2,500 years of history, quite a number of traditions have developed in Buddhism, which have all developed their own approach. So if you are seriously interested, it is good to have a bit of patience to get 'all the pieces of the puzzle' in place so to speak.|`|AA10239241	Buddhism is not a religion -- it is a philosophy.  It started as a heretical sect within Hinduism which is a religion, though.  Buddha means "Enlightened One".  Buddha realized after much meditation that the problems of life, suffering, ill health, aging, death are all the result of one thing:  desire.  So in order to avoid these terrible things, one must get rid of desire.  That about sums up Buddhism. However, from there, there are various levels of it.|`|uUCTem2Eaa	Siddhattha Gotama, the Buddha, was born in the year 480 B.C.E. He was a prince who lived in luxury and had everything he could desire. But one day he traveled outside of the palace and saw the suffering of the common people. This filled him with compassion and he could not return to palace life. So he ran away at the age of 29 and decided to search for the truth. He realized that serving just oneself was futile because one cannot take their possessions with them when they die, so instead one should dedicate their life to helping others. He practiced various forms of asceticism (self-torture, starving himself, not sleeping), but soon realized this was just another extreme. He came to the realization that the best way to live was not one extreme (luxury) or another (austerity) but the Middle Way or Middle Path, a life of moderation. So he set out on his own and left all other teachers. He achieved enlightenment at the age of 35, and spent the rest of his life traveling and teaching others what he had learned.|`|bGUWUgUqaa	The story about how Buddhism started:<br>  <a href="http://en.epochtimes.com/n2/world/from-royalty-to-asceticism-4423.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.epochtimes.com/n2/world/from-r...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.epochtimes.com/n2/world/on-the-path-to-buddhahood-4982.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.epochtimes.com/n2/world/on-the...</a><br>  <br>  The basic Buddhist belief and meditation technique are explained in the 'Falun Gong' book.

Other religions don't worry so much about the point of origin, so that wrongness isn't an issue (Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, etc.)  Hinduism and Greek philosophic pantheistic ideas posit a Demiurge (the Brahman in Hindu) which is a universal creative force, and all things in and of the universe are emanations of this force, but this in no way proves other religions "wrong", just causes the Gods or lesser creative forces they worship to be emanations or avatars (yes, that was a word long before there were computer personifications) of the greater force. <br>  <br>  What's more, if people could ignore the differences in their religions' metaphysical speculations about what lies beyond our realm, they'd find that we all have the same ideal about how to get along with each other in this world.

You are also missing the philosophical side of it.  Try thinking of religion as a mountain, everyone trying to climb, but many different paths.  Most highly enlightened people will agree that all religion is of the same purpose (for the most part), but with different views of how to obtain that purpose.|`|Gt5JzC2Daa	As I see it, the flaw is all pervasive idea of "binary truth", ie things can be either true of false, and there can only be one correct answer. In my experience of life that's only very rarely the case (instead you could say something is more/less correct than something else, but remember it's still a "judgement call")<br>  <br>  You're also forgetting religion is experienced by individuals, and as a person's religion religion/spirituality/philosophy are based upon their personal experiences. Consider that if everyone "lives in their own universe" then they could all be correct with regard to their own universe.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_cave" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_c...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_...</a><br>  <br>  Even "science" has different explanations for why things are the way they are...

That's why this religion here is the only right one and the other one over here is the only right one.  They are right when they get your money, otherwise it is all the same God and man has put limitations on the one true God and that is sad.|`|yNNdHDKvaa	You are definitely missing something.<br>  In the beginning, there was only one ,so called "religion" .Those who believed in one God and worshiped only one God.<br>  Throughout the Old Testament, when it speaks of different "alters being set up throughout a rulers kingdom that God has always spoken ill of,...these are the other religions that are implausible.<br>  I believe that is why today you have those who choose to be Non-Denominational. Trying to get back to the Worship of One God under the same singular united religion, and I believe "Christianity" should be that one religion.|`|AA11570675	You are missing something.<br>  Three of the major religions share a common root - Judaism, Christianity & Islam. Judaism is the original, Christianity is an offshoot of it & Islam is a political philosophy designed in about the 7th century which takes advantage of the enslaving power of religion to control people, so it adopts & adjusts bits of both Judaism & Christianity.<br>  Then there are all sorts of offshoots based on these 3, some of which are separate & some claim to be inside them.<br>  Other than this you get a real "mix & match". There are philosophies that look like religions so they don't tend to lay claim to a creator and there are loads of animistic beliefs i.e. beliefs in local spirits that are worshipped like gods, and also loads of polytheistic beliefs i.e. they believe in many gods. Again these don't lay claim to having the one God who created the world. I'm not sure if there are any other religions claiming a single deity as creator of the world Given the near universality of religion in culture, there are almost bound to be some. <br>  But this plethora of beliefs doesn't disprove religion. Compare it to a bingo session. If 100 bingo cards are sold each session, the 99 that don't win don't invalidate the one that does win, do they? <br>  It's just that with religion you've got a lot more evidence to go on than just chance, so if you're interested you'll have to do some research & see which if any is likely to score.|`|G2yUpoqfaa	You answered your question.  There can only be one truth.  Other things to a concept can be "partially" true, but only one is whole.<br>  <br>  Claims of authenticity by "orthodox" with a capital "O" are also only partially true, which makes the water even more murky.  One needs to take up a thorough investigation of what St. Thomas says, for there true orthodoxy of the Catholic Religion (before Vatican II) is answered.  Today, however, Vatican II is in many places contradictory to St. Thomas and the Summa.  <br>  <br>  It is still very confusing to those asking questions.  But think of those in the Vatican II religion who don't even know what questions to ask!

Suggesting that there were others?  Maybe they all tried to take credit and that's where the problem started.<br>  <br>  If i got that wrong then maybe the story of creation got passed down and slightly altered each time it passed giving birth to several religions?

There can be only ONE truth, one true religion.  The others while containing perhaps elements of truth cannot by definition contain the fullness of truth.  <br>  <br>  Christianity holds that:<br>  1) The Hebrew race were the keepers of Truth from Adam and Eve, down through Noah, Abraham, Moses to the time of Christ.<br>  2) That same truth was expounded upon and made perfect through the coming of the Son of God - Jesus Christ.  i.e. God Himself revealed to the human race the way forward.<br>  <br>  What this says about other religions is that despite good intensions and people of good will in all cultures, races and creeds - they will not have the fullness of Christ.|`|ahAOjZ9Vaa	It does not disprove.

God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.”—John 4:21-24.<br>  <br>  So if a religion has only ONE lie it is not acceprable to God.|`|AA11578666	no it doesnt<br>  <br>  and yes, ur missing like the vry essence of it. <br>  its hard to explain, but try talkin to a priest, or reading the Bible, those are great places to start<br>  <br>  good luck! & God Bless :)<br>  <br>  ?peace&love?

Let's not jump the gun; let's see how things will fare over the next 2 years. A society or nation is Stupid, not Great only when more than half of its citizens are illiterate, refuse to change their attitudes, work hard or let things go into a downward, suicidal spiral. <br>  <br>  The leadership needs to gather all the gifted persons/geniuses in the country into an Action Stations mode and start finding creative solutions in all the critical areas. At the same time, more people must enhance the family unity(3-tier family is better) and live in close proximity with co-operation(sharing of resources), and racial harmony, esp among immediate neighbours.

etcMARCAaa	You may want a traditional Christian answer.  I am a Deist so my belief is very different.  I don't believe that God really cares overly if you believe or not.  God exists but has no apparent desire to rule us or punish unbelievers or accpet 10% of our income. This may be because God realizes that if we rely on a God to solve all of our problems then we will make no effort to solve them ourselves.  If God has a plan for humanity then it stands to reason that humanity must do something to fulfill that plan.  If we had a God providing for every need, catching us when we fall, wiping our little bottoms and so on then we will not do whatever we are intended to do to fulfill any plan God may have. Many of the religions would hold that we are basically pets.  We have no real purpose but to worship God.  If thats the case then it makes no sense to give us intelligence beyond the ability to adore for every waking hour.  Cats are even smarter than that yet God doesn't make them worship either.  I accept that there is a God and it makes perfect sense that God generally lets you live your life without interference. If simply praying would provide everything you ever desire than why would you do anything at anytime but pray?  Why learn, why work, why create, why not just sit on your but all day and say God go get me another beer because I adore you?|`|zEoRcL91aa	As long as the devil helped you in winter, you could save on heating costs, right?<br>  Arguing with a rel. freak is about as useless as arguing with a drunk.<br>  <br>  You are right, taking responsibility for your own life and actions is the only way forward.

I don't have a problem with the title "African American", but when they feel offense to the title "Blacks" I don't feel it is correct to call them something there ancestors came from years and years ago. They are American just like me and you. So, I say we call Denzel Washington, and Chris Rock, and even Bill Cosby "Americans". Except Colin Powell, is he really black? I consider him halfsies.

However, I have wanted to know why many Caucasians hate the term AA so much.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	Like many people you are confusing the term African American with nationality and that is not what it is. African American is an ethnicity of Black people. Historically Black people have never identified by race. Black people place more importance in ancestral ethnicity and  tribal affiliation. Therefore African Americans are Americans by nationality. If a Black person born in an African nation that was a citizen of that nation migrated to America and became an American citizen that person would be American but not African American. That is the difference. The identity African American identifies Black people born in America who have lost their African ethnicity and tribal identity through slavery. Because we know that the indigenous original land of Black people is Africa African American make recognition of this in their ethnic identity. It's like Native Americans are American in terms of nationality but ethnically they can be Cherokee, Apache, Chickasaw, Iroquois, Navajo and so on.  I hope you have a better understanding of this.|`|xy2yoALcaa	its a catch 22 <br>  on one hand if you stop callin blacks african americans that would be robbing us of the lil bit of history that we have <br>  <br>  on the other hand to call us african american and not call whites european american would be bs <br>  <br>  so in the end it doesnt matter to me<br>  <br>  none of this matters|`|69ebdfa872907c9eb5cba61e41e731b8aa	I want to know why it bothers you all so much, it has NOTHING to do with you all<br>  <br>  I am black and hang around lots of black people, I'm not saying you are lying or anything but I have never personally ever heard a black person get mad at someone calling them black instead of african american, most people I know don't have a problem with either term, and I swear I think you white folks dream this stuff up|`|OmSJR5UFaa	I agree with you, we are all Americans here, but of course someone is going to take offense with what we say.<br>  <br>  I'm not into this "we are all from Africa orginally" bull as it does not address your question about America and Americans.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	Well.... if their ancestors are allegedly from Africa, then I don't see why not.

Really nothing can change that at all. Have you ever known anyone who decided "I don't want to be gay" and turned straight? They could hide it, sure, but it never goes away.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	No; but since human sexuality is not a binary, gay/straight dichotomy, there's a good chance that the person also has some "straightness" in them that they might then choose to start favoring.|`|hQDapmICaa	Absolutely YES!|`|sAvqCBvVaa	i gave all people free will to do what they want|`|hdFn4Dobaa	I believe so dear. <br>  There are people that I know that the Lord has answered their prayers regarding going straight.

Of course not.  I just use this as an example because you say that according to the bible all things are possible.  Don't you think a god would be more concerned with real pain and suffering than who people love?   He must be pretty bored and petty if his priority is chaging peoples sex and love lives to suit the agenda of the christian fundies.<br>  <br>  But think just how many gay people have prayed and prayed and prayed not to be gay.  Guess what?  They still are.<br>  It's not a choice.  I get that you are not attacking, but people just need to accept that some people are gay, there has always been people that are gay and we should just all get on with our own lives and stop thinking about what kind of love and sex other people are having.|`|fhaABrwiaa	just beacuse you pray to god about certain things, it does not mean he/she does it. you can ask god for guidance, he will provide guidence. you ask god for an ipod however, dont expect one to come flying out of the sky for you. god guides your path and tries to lead you from temptation and into right. <br>  <br>  you however choose your path, not god. <br>  <br>  and it is the persons choice to be gay/straight, god doesnt just go "this ones gay, this ones bi, this ones straight".|`|AA10054998	I have no idea if He would change them.  That's really up to G-d.  What I know is that we are all born with original sin - that inclination toward sin.

I didn't like them, but I found them very attractive." He added that, "Most homosexuals are not proud of it, don't like it, feel there's something wrong, and they want to fix it. They're uncomfortable with it." <br>  <br>  At this point in his life, Kevin began to blame God for his homosexuality, "I was still an active church [attendee], but I couldn't understand why God would punish me with homosexuality." He said his faith suffered, as later in life his homosexuality drove him away from it entirely. <br>  <br>  After years of living the gay lifestyle and marching in gay pride parades, Kevin commented on how his life changed, "The Holy Spirit breaks the heart of stone very well, and that's what he must have done with me because I refused to let God in. If he gets in there he's going to change your life around. Somebody must have been praying for me because the Holy Spirit got in there and made me question all of this gay theology." <br>  <br>  After time, Kevin began to realize the intellectual holes in the theology, which affected him emotionally. This realization prompted him to look into ways of leaving homosexuality. "I had heard somewhere on the news about a group that was for ex-gays." The group he heard about is called Exodus, which is an interdenominational, Christian nonprofit organization that helps gays leave the homosexual lifestyle. <br>  <br>  Kevin then took his first step toward freedom from homosexuality. "I called a church, and I got a hold of a local group, the local Exodus chapter called Outpost. They just sent information to me, and I read it over and over again." <br>  <br>  He admitted that his overall change did not happen overnight. In fact, he said it spanned a period of about five years. "As I got to know men [as friends], women became strange. They became odd. And over a period of time, women started to get attractive." Kevin said his change occurred on several levels: political, emotional, and spiritual. He is now married, with a daughter.|`|AA11297267	A fairly small number have tried...none have succeeded.<br>  I can't remember the guy's name (maybe I can find it on-line), but there was a somewhat famous case that one of the tv preachers had been using as an "example" -- a gay man that supposedly through the power of prayer had been "changed" to be straight, had gotten married, and was being touted as proof that homosexuality is a choice and that god can cure it.  They stopped using him as an example when he left his wife and went back to being openly gay, and the guy himself said it was all a sham...he had been convinced that he *wanted* to be straight, and had tried really hard, but in the end he couldn't deny who he was.<br>  <br>  Apparently with god all things are possible...except healing anybody, changing how someone is born, moving any mountains, regrowing limbs, saving lives, etc. etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Peace.
Z9jlS2bUaa	the mommy haircut. I guess some women feel that they don't have time or energy to care for their hair when they have children. And maybe if their husbands were different, they wouldn't cut their hair. Women with certain kinds of men in certain kinds of marriages do not cut their hair short ever (they don't WANT to.. it's not that they have no choice). Also i've heard that as ppl get older, a shorter hairstyle can work like an instant facelift. I've never bought into this b/c to me, older women with long hair always seem more youthful. Btw.. men cut their hair as they get older too! Just think back in college, soooooo many guys have long hair.. they keep their bangs long, wear it in a sexy shaggy stuff in their face and eyes and stuff. Then when they start working and start making babies, away with the bad boy hair, they get that safe, clean cut haircut.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Most of them tell me that long hair is too much trouble.  I disagree.  I'm in my mid-forties and my hair is about hip-length.  I simply wash it and let it go.  If I have to I can put it in a low pony tail.<br>  <br>  Last month I was listening to talk radio and this subject came up.  Their theory was that the shorter a woman's hair, the less interest she has in sex.  Younger women were more likely to have longer hair while women who were in a relationship for a while were more likely to cut their hair shorter.  Women who were recently divorced and looking to date were more likely to grow their hair longer.  Most women in men's mags have long hair--in fact, for most advertisements involving sex appeal the female usually has long hair.<br>  <br>  I don't know if I believe in this theory since there are so many exceptions to the rule but it was good food for thought.|`|757c91a5e3a9215007b5dd0c6436e097aa	Maybe women from lets say, thirty years ago, but todays older women want to keep their 'youth' keeping their hair long. Honestly, I don't care what other women do to their hair whether it's short long or shaved bald.<br>  <br>  I'm the opposite, I have really short hair and in my 20s, with no children and not married. I guess the stereotype isn't really true these days.|`|46fouwFfaa	As people age, their hair thins out. With some older people who originally had fine, thin hair, some parts of their scalp may be visible if it's long since their hair has thinned out quite a bit over the years. It may not seem like cutting one's hair short makes someone's hair look thicker but it does. Their scalp and thinner areas of their hair will be much less visible, their hair will look thicker, healthier, and more shiny and that will give them an overall more youthful look.|`|Dn8i9sIlaa	or they just want to try something new<br>  <br>  luckily I got the short-hair phase out of me while I was a teenager, hehe|`|5ZgyczUwaa	maybe it makes them seem younger or compliments their face shape? who knows|`|PednbuLqaa	My guess is that when wemen get older they get grey hair and cutting it will make it easier to die back to it's original color but there are many different reasons

There are also people that use to work that had something trajic happen to them in life, like a accident on the job or a car accident, or somehow became terminally ill.

Mainly this is such right wing garbage I am surprised you had the gall to write it. We are a nation, a very mixed nation. At times many of us fall victim to redundancy, injury, illness etc. The nation is there to support us through these times. There are people who abuse this fact. They have never paid anything into society. This is unlike those who have worked for years paying in Tax and National Insurance.

Like limiting the number of children a household can have based upon  family income.  If you don't make at least 40k a year you can have no more than four kids.  If you have three & then give birth to twins to push you over the threshold than choose one to go up for adoption.  Or if you are disabled and/or widowed, then you must put some kids up for adoption so that you are not a drain on society.<br>  <br>  WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY MORE IN TAXES TO RAISE SOMEONE ELSE'S KIDS?!?!?!<br>  <br>  Edit:  While we are at it ... why not sell child-bearing permits!!!
bnfsdHHgaa	Hell yeah, I would take the J-Man out for some brews or if he prefers he can have some sacramental wine. We would go out and get all buzzed. I would be Jesus's wing man as he tries to find that lucky lady to have the next immaculate conception. We would have to take him shopping since bare feet and whit robes went out after the 60's and 70's. <br>  <br>  Actually to be all honest. If Jesus Christ ever came back to earth he would end this damn planet. Humans today are the most disgraceful things in the world today. Killing each other, destroying the planet. Im pretty sure satan is winning the fight between good and evil right now. <br>  "The greatest trick satan ever pulled is convincing people he didn't exist."|`|lAMdAKmzaa	I guess it would depend on how specifically you did it.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Treating him as your buddy is very disrespectful.

We can tell a lot from who Jesus chose as his 12 closest friends.  Most of them were fishermen.  Rough around the edges and to use Peter as an example, outspoken and passionate.  <br>  <br>  Jesus' disciples, (friends) were the not good enough people in His time.  They were not good enough to be in the synagogue schools, so they chose other professions that were not very prestigious.  <br>  <br>  Jesus also hung around those viewed as the lower end of society.  Mostly because Jesus saw them as the ones needing the most care.|`|ntef2sPMaa	I think jesus would smoke a fattie fattie with me while rollin down broadway. and turnin that bob marley **** up.

I think it would be a good movie for you to watch.<br>  <br>  It portrays Jesus as going for walks, cracking jokes, having a water-splashing fight with His disciples, and being very human and charismatic. It is also very true to the Gospel and gives us humans a down-to-earth explanation of what happened and why.<br>  <br>  My guess is the when He comes back, He will have a pretty comprehensive to-do list. I don't know if He will have time to hang out, but I am sure He knows what is in our hearts and will treat us exactly the way we need to be treated, that is, if we think of Him as a friend, He will be 'a friend' to us. If we need Him to be authoritative and dominating and full of 'smiting', then that is what He will be. <br>  <br>  Personally, I see Him as being my friend/older brother, so I hope we will be able to have that sort of relationship when we do meet.|`|OOYHJAcfaa	Well he came once and when he comes back it will be judgement time. You certainly can't miss it. It won't be quiet. He's not going to hang out. He going to take some to heaven and others to hell. Then you can kick it with him (if you go with him). I think he is funny and there's parts in the Bible where I was laughing.|`|CLFwZ3MBaa	he would walk alot as in old days people didnt had cars. he would smile but not laugh. he would be relaxed but sensible. he wont have to study as he would knows about the teachings of GOD. his only book is Bible and he knows it. the last one you wont get the smack down as GOD is always forgiving. once you ask for forgivness from your heart you would be.
AA11058044	It's not the washing machine, it's the dryer.<br>  <br>  It's a little known fact that rayon, commonly used in the manufacture of socks, actually contains small amounts of Dark matter (which really, really should have been called Doesn't matter, but I digress...).<br>  <br>  Anyhow, the centrifugal action combined with accelerated particle dynamics caused by heat in the dryer interact with the Dark matter in the socks to open a vortex in the space-time continuum, a miniature wormhole if you will, which sucks the socks through into a parallel dimension.  <br>  <br>  A small number of socks are also stolen by mad scientists, who are trying to gather sufficient Dark matter for their nefarious experiments.

Verse 2 sets the scene; the earth was formless and empty (and in darkness). God separating and gathering on days 1-3 gave form. God making and filling on days 4-6 removed the emptiness. God's first creative word called forth light in the midst of the primeval darkness (verse 3) on Day 1, which Day was marked by evening and morning. Verse 3 is singular - "light" (before vegetation). Verse 14 is plural - "lights" (after vegetation). Verse 3 is forming. Verse 14 is filling. So it looks as if light as a single source was created on Day 1 but on Day 3 a lot of organising and differentiating of light was done.|`|AA11992885	please, use your head, even in fairytale land this is easy to understand<br>  <br>  if God can create vegetation, certainly HE can maintain the life of vegetation until such time that HE creates the sun and the moon, and HE will be the nutrients for them|`|2WnbP80Taa	This is exactly the point I have made on a six day creation-young earth theory--Plants can survive without sun for several weeks even-Thanks for helping me with my point of view.<br>  <br>  I don't really care about the thumbs down either|`|MSHxYrLEaa	he didn't<br>  <br>  he made the heavens and the earth first. this includes the sun<br>  <br>  genesis was written by the perspective as if someone was on earth, and earth was full of carbon dioxide, time is measured by light. so each 'day' ended when light shone through the clouds<br>  <br>  it was these plants that used the carbon dioxide to turn the dioxide into oxygen.<br>  <br>  people who agree with the big bang will agree this is how we have the air we have today|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Read it first":<br>  When God[3] began to create heaven and earth, and the earth then was welter and waste and darkness over the deep and God's breath hovering over the waters, God said, 'Let there be light.' and there was light"(Genesis chapter 1:3) [4]; the "firmament" separating "the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament;" dry land and seas and plants and trees which grew fruit with seed; the sun, moon and stars in the firmament; air-breathing sea creatures and birds; and on the sixth day, "the beasts of the earth according to their kinds." "Then God said, Let us make man in our image ... in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them."[5] On the Sabbath, God rests from the task of completing the heavens and the earth: "So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If animals need oxygen to breathe, that means the forests and plants would have to be producing oxygen for animals to survive and evolve.

According to some Eastern philosophy, the universe goes in cycles, each of which has four stages.  At the beginning of the cycle, things are indeed perfect.  Then some imperfection is introduced, and then more, and finally things are chaotic and hellish.  But the successive stages are shorter and shorter, so the more perfect stages last the longest.  The idea is that if things were completely perfect all the time, it would ultimately be boring.  So we're just living in the fourth stage, is all.  After that, the universe is destroyed and then the cycle starts all over again.<br>  <br>  And I'm not sure, but I think maybe the possibilities for adventure are the greatest in the final stage, because you don't know what's going to happen.  Things could really be hell, so it hold the potential to be more exciting.|`|LZJPMl8raa	We were supposed to be in paradise in the Garden of Eden.

(No man has seen God at any time, yet Jesus SEES God and copies His behaviors, so Jesus must be something MORE than a mere man, since no MAN has seen God.) He KNEW God. He even said that He came from the very HEART of God, so He could say objectively, "When you've seen ME, you've seen the Father."<br>  Furthermore, Jesus said "I am Truth." Was Jesus telling the truth when He said that? Or was He a liar?<br>  <br>  Jesus also said "I am Life", and again, "I am the bread of Life that has come down from My Father in heaven to give Life.", and again, "I am the water of life. Whoever is thirsty, come to me, and out of his inner-most being shall flow rivers of living waters", and finally, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. If any man believe in me, though he may die, yet shall he live again."<br>  <br>  He said, "You already believe in God, now believe in me."<br>  <br>  In his famous book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis makes the following observation: "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us."|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	i accept that there is no such thing as a "messiah" who will clean up all the shít we do

John 1:10-12<br>  <br>  If you are not God's child, you are a son of the devil. Wherelese do you think God would send those?<br>  ""If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me. 43Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. 44You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 45Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! 46Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? 47He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God." John 8:42-47|`|F5v5Qme0aa	Stop giving God the credit for the good stuff and blaming Satan for the bad. We all need to take responsibility for our own reality and stop looking outside of ourselves for answers. <br>  <br>  Religion was created by man to rule over others by using fear and guilt - and it seems to be working pretty well.  God is the energy that created the universe and binds the comos. He loves us and guides us, but just like children learning to walk, he knows that we need to fall down so  we can learn to get up on our own. <br>  <br>  Life is about lessons... not just being comfortable and care-free.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	If He doesn't "let" anyone choose ungodly behavior - if He doesn't "let" people reject Him and hate Him and want to spend eternity apart from Him - then humans are merely animals, without free will and having no claim to eternal life.  If He does let us choose, then we have to live with our own choices,  We can't blame God.|`|lNtwpzpOaa	Adam and Eve weren't in Heaven, they were in Eden, they were cast from Eden for sinning against God, but there is nothing that says they were in Heaven. <br>  <br>  Evil didn't turn Satan, Satan created evil and sin. The sin that made Satan fall was selfishness. Selfishness in itself isn't evil, but it can lead to evil and thus it is Satan who created evil and sin by calling war against God. There was no evil, but God gives us free will because He loves us. How would you feel if you were forced to worship?<br>  <br>  You say you want God to remove your free will, but truly think about it. Could you love someone you were forced to love? God does not want forced love, He wants free love. He wants us to give Him our love out of adoration, not out of servitude. <br>  <br>  It does seem like it would be easier if we didn't have free will, but instead of loving God, we would resent God for making us love him just as we would resent anyone who forced us to do their bidding. <br>  <br>  Hell is not just punishment, but it is a sign of God's love. He gives us the choice to live with Him in all eternity or stay away from Him and His love for all eternity. Because He does love us completely and He does respect us, He lets us make that choice. There is no one in Hell who is repentant, those who are in Hell have made the choice to be there because they have rejected God's love and despised God. <br>  <br>  Hell is a locked door, from the inside. All those who are in Hell want to be there. <br>  <br>  <br>  It is a struggle, it's hard, but all you can do is pray. Whenever you feel like you're about to commit a sin, pray for strength against that sin. Whenever you feel your mind wandering from God, re-direct it back to God. <br>  <br>  It is supposed to be a struggle, suffering brings us closer to God and therefore it is worth it. You can ask Him to help you refrain from sin and evil, but He will not take away your free will, that is a gift from God and should be cherished.<br>  <br>  Also, the "Once Saved, Always Saved" idea is incorrect. The Bible talks about losing your salvation. Believing in Jesus and then not believing in Him does not save you from Hell.  And also, just because you're a good person doesn't mean you'll get into Heaven. There are many people who are good people who don't believe in God, I will not tresspass on God's mercy, but I cannot garauntee these people will make it into Heaven.<br>  <br>  All people are children of God, God loves even the most hardened of hearts and the most evil of men, but that doesn't mean they love Him back. Try to live a good life, but lead a life of prayer, penance, love, charity and let your works speak for your faith. We are saved by grace and live by faith, but we are justified by our works.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	God does not force or predestinate<br>  anyone to Hell:one goes of his own free-will choises.<br>  <br>  The All-Good God has taken all suffering on Himself by become one of us and suffering as Jesus for our salvation  and that we may no longer suffer in the next life<br>  <br>  Evil is a negation, a lack of balanced  and necessary good, not a positive being<br>  <br>  Lucifer was created good and to be good in union with and  in service of God and God's Creation but the angel( who has free will, which is crucial to love and the reality of good and evil)rebelled but as an angel he cannot be killed<br>  <br>  Only God Who is All Good,All-Wise,etc, is eternal and infinite<br>  and Evil is a lack of union with and obedience to the All-Good and came about with the rebellion of the angel usurpers<br>  <br>  Now that the rebel Angels have forsaken the state of Heaven ( full union with God) we have no fear of evil in heaven.<br>  God bless|`|wl1wVZ4Haa	We all know that in God there is no evil. But does that eliminate the possibility that God created evil. Before you give me a thumbs down, please hear me out. There's nothing to make me think that if a completely holy being created evil, that it would tarnish his goodness and void his holiness. Consider Satan. He was a created being. He can not create anything. So you know that evil was not created by a creature. Satan didn't make Adam or Eve sin. He enticed them, and they fell by their own free will. A free will that has not been available to mankind since that fatal day in the garden. Evangelicals seem to think that everyone is free to chose God. But that error belittles the deleterious result of the fall of man. And it also robs the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit. Romans says that there is no one righteous. No one seeks after God. We are evil to our hearts. But given the fact that Jesus nailed our sins to the cross, the redeemed can say that we are holy. Not by our own righteousness, but through the righteousness's imputed to us by our Savior. And consider this mind blowing statement by Paul. Romans 9:22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. That kind of blows the whole free will thing out of the water. God is righteous in his wrath poured out on sinners. We mostly hear all about God's love for man. And hey, that's cool. But let's not neglect every aspect of his being.|`|WwCBomTMaa	Why does a parent ground their child for breaking the rules? God has many children, some are worse than others. Since he gave everyone free will it is up to us which path we choose. He has given us fair warning what will happen if we break the rules. So now it is for us to decide whether we are going to be good children, or rebellious children. There are consequences for both.|`|HMteUyRdaa	Because life on Earth is a trial, a test, God wants us to give our free will back to Him and live in His will where we will live and rejoice with Him for ever in the eternal bliss of Heaven.<br>  <br>  Evil did not get to Satan, like you and me the Angels were given a test of their nature, Satan was prideful and believed He was as good as God but he was only a creation of God, so God had St.Michael cast out Satan and all the Angels he swayed from Gods love out of Heaven.<br>  Satan is the one who brought evil into the heavens, rebelling against God, and Satan brought evil into the world creating the prideful disobedience of Adam and Eve. <br>  <br>  We are being tested, if you pass the test and live in the love and mercy of the Father, you will go to Heaven someday.

This is for us to choose whether or not we do good here on Earth, or not. And that will determine His Judgment. <br>  Believe it or not, even God will be 'fair' with the Devil.  You are safe from evil as long as you believe in Jesus and try your best to obey His commandments and learn about Him. <br>  <br>  Evil didn't get into Heaven. Satan thought he can be as great as God, and tried to make God a deal. God doesn't do deals, and God is the only God, and Satan did not want to be second to God. He wanted to rule the world. God ended up casting him down. Yes you're right, Satan use to be an Angel. No more though. Satan chose a different road for himself. <br>  <br>  In Adam and Eve days, everything was pure. Everything was innocent. God told Adam and Eve that they were restricted from eating from the Tree of Knowledge (its fruit), and Satan appeared as a serpant enticing Eve to give Adam that apple, and she did, and he took it. That broke the purity of this ground you and I walk on. God then gave us our own free will to choose Him, or the devil's ways. Good or evil. <br>  <br>  God is merciful though. We are human. We will make mistakes. But as long as we learn from them, and pray for redemption, He will be merciful. <br>  <br>  Keep praying. One door does not close without another one opening. Keep an eye out for it. We are all struggling in these times. Yes some worse than others, but it does not make your pain any less important to God. Just keep your faith in Him, and He will carry you.  It's hard I know. I've struggled with my own personal issues myself, but life is a bumpy road. Just keep your head up high and roll with it.  :-) Or break those bumps too.  :-)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11623639	Oh Dear. GOD IS GOOD..

He is right there and waiting to adopt you into the family..  <br>  <br>  Billy Graham's daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her 'How could God let something like this happen?' (regarding Katrina and other ugly things). Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response.  She said, 'I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives.  And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out.  How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?' <br>  <br>  In light of recent events... terrorists attack, school shootings, etc.  I think it started when Madeleine Murray O'Hare (she was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn't want prayer in our schools, and we said OK.  Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school.  The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself.  And we said OK.<br>  <br>  Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr Spock's son committed suicide).  We said an expert should know what he's talking about.  And we said OK.<br>  <br>  Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.<br>  <br>  Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out.  I think it has a great deal to do with 'WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.'<br>  <br>  Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell  Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.  Funny how you can send 'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.  Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.<br>  <br>  Now what was the question again?<br>  <br>  Peace and blessings from Texas <><|`|G49lKR56aa	God only ask that we believe in him and what he says, about him and the Lord Jesus.

Some of your questions cannot be thoroughly answered because we don't know what exactly happened thousands of years ago. Now the story of lucifer being an angel and wanting to be like God which led him to hell may be real and may be just a story with a moral. Ofcourse God can and is destroying evil, but he won't just wave his magic wand and make the whole world better, especially for people who don't deserve it. We gotta make the world a better place, we're the ones living on Earth so it's our responsibility to make it as great a we can. As a Christian, i believe that God knows what we're gonna do, every sin we're gonna commit, but he doesn't stop us because we have to learn from our mistakes, he has to see whether we're gonna regret our mistakes and try to be better or if we're just gonna lose faith. If he stops us from every sin we're gonna do, then what's the point in even living? We're just gonna be living perfect, boring lives.<br>  <br>  Concerning your struggle, i would like to ask you to go to church, to pray persistingly, and to stay positive with everything you're going through no matter how hard times get.

Satan implied that humans would be better off without God's rule.<br>  Adam and Eve rebelled against God and followed what Satan said.<br>  Remember that there are spirit creatures in heaven that were alive long before humans were created.<br>  If God immediately destroyed Adam and Eve would it have answered Satan's question? Wouldn't some of the angels be thinking maybe God can be proved wrong?<br>  Here's an illustration:<br>  A teacher solves a math problem on the students homework<br>  A student thinks he can solve it better.<br>  Now if the teacher shuts the kid down and doesnt allow the student to at least try to prove their point, would not that make you think maybe the student might have a better solution?<br>  <br>  Daniel 7:13,14 "A war broke out in heaven"<br>  Then in Revelation 12:7,9,12 "Woe for the Earth because Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time left".<br>  The Devil and his followers were cast to the Earth and removed from heaven in 1914.

He takes a lump of metal that isn't really worth much. That is us. Then he pounds it and heats it, tempering it. That is suffering, both through our own sins and, inadvertantly, through the sins of others. When he's done, where is the lump of metal? It is a beautiful, well-tempered sword, with a sharp edge, perfected by heat and fire. <br>  <br>  How does the metal become a sword without being tempered? How can we become perfected if we do not suffer? <br>  <br>  There are some who resist the tempering. A piece of metal that resists tempering and refuses to obey the will of the swordsmith is discarded. The discard pile is like Hell. What good is a lump of metal that will not be formed by the will of the swordsmith? What good are we if we will not be transformed by the will of God?|`|lywRBk4Kaa	He allows us to choose, my friend.  Just as He allowed Lucifer to choose, all of His creations are given free will.  Yes, prior to Lucifer's creation, God knew of his betrayal.  A better question would be, if Lucifer changed his mind and asked for God's forgiveness, would he receive it?  Of course, I doubt that will ever happen.  God allows all of His creations to choose between sin and holiness.  Without that allowance, we would be robots and anything we did would be without true meaning.  God wants us to choose Him, not because we have to, but because we want to.  A choice without choice is not choice at all.|`|m58dbfIGaa	Hey, <br>  <br>  I understand.  It seems pretty contridictory to think that a Good God would allow bad things to happen, or even allow seemingly good people go to a bad place.  But if we think about it, He's given us every chance we can think of.  He is perfect.  When we were created originally, Adam and Eve were perfect.  However, with that He gave us freedom of choice, which meant that we can choose to do what we want.  We can either follow His instructions, laws, etc, or we can choose to do our own thing.  Eve (with the help of temptation) made a choice against God's Law.  From that stemmed sin and death.  <br>  <br>  We are safe from evil in God's protection.  That requires us to follow Him, though, and be willing to be His.  <br>  Yes, there are several things about Satan we don't understand (like what provoked him to turn), but rest assured, God protects His children.  <br>  One reason He doesn't destroy evil is because He gave the angels bodies that can't be destoyed (much like we will have when we die).  If He were to destroy them, that would make God a liar, sinning against His own laws (if that makes sense).  But rest assured that God has condemned Satan and evil to Hell, a place without God.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|0385ed671600e5004e9e637add7f646faa	if u add me on yahoo i can answer all those questions using the bible. cause the bible talks about all those questions just no one knows where to look so i can help.<br>  and if we read the bible. the actual word hell dosnt appear in the bible the King James bible mis-translated this word. the actual word is She'ol<br>  witch means the common grave of mankind. <br>  the teaching of hell fire dint come up in religion until about 400 years after Jesus had died. and it was actually a pagan worship belief.<br>  the bible does talk about banishing Satan very soon. <br>  Evil is not as old as God cause as u said God is the alpha and Omega.  always was and always will be. but god gave everyone freewill<br>  the angel Satan, he wanted human worship for himself.<br>  he dint believe that God was aloud to set rule's down for us to follow.<br>  Satan tempted Eve in the garden to be rebellious and be independent from God. <br>  there so much more if u add me on yahoo all be happy to help u with all ur questions and as i said, i will show u all the scriptures from the bible

They can carry love or hate. Fear or faith.And we are in control of the words we speak. YOU choose whether you will defile yourself with the words you speak.

WSwDFwC5aa	The first thing you need to do is to start changing your personal style to combat the emo perception.  Rather than simply avoiding stereotypical "emo" clothing and cosmetics, you should pick up some truly unique and non-conformist habits.<br>  <br>  Just say no to black or purple hair.  Stick with a powdered wig for true 18th century charm.<br>  <br>  Have glasses?  Don't trade them in for contacts, get a pince-nez pair for stylish distance vision.<br>  <br>  And hats...  Everyone looks better with a hat.  Try a fez or sombrero for a stylish twist.<br>  <br>  Next you need to actively destroy the perception that you are immersed in "emo" cultural pursuits.  Start reading a lot - but be careful about what you choose.  Harry Potter is right out, anything about vampires should be avoided, and by all means never touch anything by a French Existentialist.<br>  <br>  Instead start carrying around copies of hard-hitting German philosophers like Hegel or Kant.  John Locke is good too.<br>  <br>  Finally, the music.  Drop the chemical romance people and indulge in the classics.  And by classics I mean Motown.  There isn't anything emo about Aretha Franklin or the Four Tops.  <br>  <br>  Stick with this tried-and-true method and the emo label will be dropped quickly!|`|Sxd0tXDwaa	your emo cause you being emotional over it|`|HOQp0gA7aa	This is easy enough.  There are a few possible solutions here.  First I recommend standing up for yourself and telling your friends to stop calling you "Emo" or you won't be friends with them anymore.  This should filter out the real friends from the jerks.  The real friends will quit, the jerks will try to ramp it up when they think they have succeeded in bothering you.<br>  <br>  The second thing you can do if this bothers you is stop acting like an "Emo" person.  The signature of an "Emo" is not their clothes or musical choices, it is their mopey weepy self centered world view.  If you don't act like a depressed prima donna prone to a crying fit at a moments notice, then the tag "Emo" is obviously not the appropriate one for you.  <br>  <br>  The third thing you can do is adopt very annoying nicknames for the people who continue to call you "Emo".  I recommend ones that suggest unsuitability for romantic activities like "wee willy", "racing stripe", "smelly", "toe-jam", and "dick-less".  This lets people know that you are tired of their antics, and are prepared to respond to fire with bombs.<br>  <br>  The fouth thing you can do is toughen up a bit and ignore the designation.  I've had people try to graft nicknames or tags on to me I didn't like before.  They all went away in time because I didn't respond to them.  I refused to get upset, or let it get under my skin.  After a while they give up and move on to another target. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|wAAhMn6Xaa	People nowadays are so f*cking ignorant.<br>  Even if you're an Emo, does it matter?<br>  I had a friend who was kinda Emo, but then she wasn't Emo anymore. <br>  People still call her Emo & make fun of her.<br>  All i'm saying is just try to ignore them. I'm sure you could fine atleast one thing weird about them.<br>  =]|`|1Ez4G7Nkaa	no one really knows what emo is..<br>  no one knows how they feel..<br>  no one knows what they go through..<br>  and to me yur not considered a emo..<br>  yur just a person who likes the style, yur no emo.<br>  i like all those things too, and i dont consider myself emo.|`|AA11634270	Kids these days are so stupid.|`|8bnOGBeGaa	they call you emo because they are steryotyping you.<br>  but they are probably just teasing you, even though its been a few years, some people just dont know when to stop.|`|CTaIUTemaa	green day is defiantly not emo in anyway shape or form.  oh yer and dont disrespect emos. ur quite nieve

Tell him you have no interest in discussing religion, and to please stop.  Keep a record of the times and dates when he tries to do this.  If he continues, show him a copy of the record, and ask him to stop this behavior every time he does this.  <br>  <br>  If he continues, tell him you'll listen just one more time, but in a more private place.  Then lead him to his boss' office, or the owner's office, or the HR office, or someone also in authority over him.  Just be sure first that the boss isn't also a religious fundamentalist.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	That's why most work places have a human resource department.<br>  <br>  In such cases I recommend you set up an appointment with your HR director and let them call the offending party into the meeting and submit your sign written statement (typed of course) with your grievance stating a request to have them stop that.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	The fact is, that sort of loony will never leave other people alone.

They have so lost contact with God it is amazing.<br>  <br>  God is NOT Catholic, Or Baptist or Methodist. He doesn`t care what club you belong to. He cares about your essence (your inner person).. He loves you and wants to have a personal relationship with YOU.. He doesn`t need you to be perfect. He never asked for perfection.. He just asks that you love him and believe Jesus lived and died to cover your sins.. That is it, in a nutshell..<br>  <br>  I would like to suggest that you window shop (Per se) Go to different denominations of churches.. If you don`t feel anything, Move on, God is NOT in the house.. You will find the right home for you. There is nothing wrong with seeking a House of God. <br>  <br>  Wisdom is a good thing and it comes by researching and studying.. You are on the right track. Choose what feels right to you.. Give each church a goodly length of time to get a feel for it. If you are not being fed in the spirit and moved in the spirit. You are in the wrong house. Move on. You will know when you find the Church home for you.. And all churches are different in doctrine.. So one baptist church may be very different than another baptist church in that ya can`t wear this or eat that junk. None of that matters to God. he wrote you a letter. it is called the bible. Study it. Find out what the words really mean... Look at different versions of the bible.. You will get a better understanding of it.. We all worship God. Get an AMPLIFIED Bible. It will open it up in ways you can`t imagine.. You are responsible for your walk with the Lord. Just because a person, Minister, Preacher or otherwise, tells you something. Does not necessarily make it right. You are getting their views on it.. You need todo your own research..<br>  <br>  THEN go to the Pastor, Priest or Minister and tell them you want to join their Church. I assure you they will be so happy and all heaven will rock and roll.. <br>  <br>  Take your time Dear. God is not going anywhere.. But remember that Pastors, priests, Ministers are humans too. They sin and fall down just like the rest of us. They are not any more special to Dad then you are. He loves all of us.. You don`t become a brain surgeon, or a race car driver, or a Chef by reading one book. It takes time. As well as much research. Contrary to popular belief, We did not get a packet of *INSTANT HOLY* and a bottle of * INSTANT GOD`S KNOWLEDGE* the second we decided to follow God.  It takes time... <br>  <br>  You must do your own research.<br>  Seek and you will find the answers.<br>  Knock and it will be opened.<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace and blessings from Texas <><|`|FjiRPKp2aa	I am an ex-protestant but here is some ideas.Most Catholic services are rather reserved.

Just simply go.  It is okay to try out different ones until you find one that fits. When you find the right one, you will know.  But keep in mind that no church is "perfect" and it is hard to find one that you believe 100% in every "rule" that they have...that is where your faith in the Lord comes in.  And with the right church and the right people that faith will grow!  I am 35 years old and did not grow up in "faith".  If I went to church it was because I went with a friend.  But when I got to college I longed to know more, so I strted reading and started "trying on" churches.  I have a tendency to be a "liberal" thinker, I love all and I have a tendency to see things from both sides...but after having children I am a little more conservative.  I chose the Catholic church as my home.  I was baptised and confirmed in 1997 and thank God...because I went through some tough times 3 years ago...my husband of 12 years left me for my best friend...ugh....but thanks to God I am better because of it.<br>  Psalm 41:9-13 (New International Version)<br>  <br>   9 Even my close friend, whom I trusted, <br>         he who shared my bread, <br>         has lifted up his heel against me. <br>  <br>   10 But you, O LORD, have mercy on me; <br>         raise me up, that I may repay them. <br>  <br>   11 I know that you are pleased with me, <br>         for my enemy does not triumph over me. <br>  <br>   12 In my integrity you uphold me <br>         and set me in your presence forever. <br>  <br>   13 Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, <br>         from everlasting to everlasting. <br>         Amen and Amen.<br>  <br>  <br>  the Lord is what got me through and my faith is ever stronger now because of it.  I like Catholicism because I find peace in our rituals and I look forward to recieving the "body and blood" of Christ every week.  But, I believe that any church that brings you closer to God and to Christ is what's best for you.  The Cathoic church offers classes on becoming Catholic called RCIA.  They are a great way to learn about faith and the life of Jesus.  I reccomend two great books by the same author....One is called "Never Alone" and one is called "Joshua" both by Joseph Girzone.  Another awesome book is Joel Osteen's "Your Best Life Now"!!  And another book of course is...the Bible!  Find a "youth" Bible or student's Bible...for starters read Psalms, Proverbs, and the four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  I understand that going to church is alone...but pray about it and just go...you will never regret it and God will be with you every step of the way.  One more source for is www.Joelosteen.com. He has sermons you can watch from his website and he is a great man to get God's word.  Good Luck on your journey.  I will be praying for you!<br>  <br>  Romans 12:11 (New International Version)<br>  11Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:3-12 (New International Version)<br>  <br>   3"Blessed are the poor in spirit, <br>        for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <br>   4Blessed are those who mourn, <br>        for they will be comforted. <br>   5Blessed are the meek, <br>        for they will inherit the earth. <br>   6Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, <br>        for they will be filled. <br>   7Blessed are the merciful, <br>        for they will be shown mercy. <br>   8Blessed are the pure in heart, <br>        for they will see God. <br>   9Blessed are the peacemakers, <br>        for they will be called sons of God. <br>   10Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, <br>        for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <br>  <br>   11"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 12Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.|`|DVuWsb2raa	Well you said it yourself.. Religion is a deeply person thing.. In my opinion, I don't see why you need to choose one! They all have some many beautiful things about them. I tend to associate myself with the religion I have the most in common with.. but I think I practice probably 6 different religions. I personalized my beliefs-- and once I started respecting all religion, the universe opened itself up to me, and I feel like I get signs everywhere I go! <br>  <br>  I ended up gathering friends to meet up (once a month since that's all we can really commit to) where we hold a "spiritual" meeting. We have 2 christians, a muslim, a buddhist, a hindu, a WICCAN! an atheist and agnostic, we also have 2 people like me.. I practice pretty much everything.. I do not read the text of the Bible, or Qur'an-- But I have read the bible, and thanks to my muslim friends, understand parts of the Qur'an. We discuss world issues involving religion, and we take turns with "sermons."|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Labels don't save.  Going to a building doesn't save.  Catholicism cannot save. Catholicism is not Christian.  Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9). <br>  <br>  Only believing in Jesus alone for salvation, is what saves!  :)<br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|V610w8EXaa	Yeah, show up with your "10%" and they'll practically give you the whole front row, if you want it.<br>  <br>  Churches want new members, but they ESPECIALLY want "TITHING" members.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS- here's a hint:  It's fine to "try on" different churches, but each one will give you a pencil and paper and want you to write down all your "personal" info (name, address, phone number, etc.) as a "record of your visit."  DO NOT FILL IT OUT or put factual information on it until you've decided that you like the church well enough ... otherwise THEY WON'T STOP BUGGING YOU.  They'll call you incessantly, show up at your house un-announced ... the WORKS!<br>  <br>  Plus, if you can drag a friend along with you on this endeavor, that may help because they can act as a second set of eyes, and remind you of things you missed (when you sit down later and "review" your visit) like the way the pastor's family looked like a bunch of 'inbred hillbillies' and stuff ...|`|xLKPKgZXaa	Start attending one first on a regular basis. If it's not the right one for you try a different one. Once you feel that it is the right one for you speak with the minister and discuss the possibility of membership. He will give you all the information you need.<br>  <br>  Remember though that once you become a born-again Christian you are already a member of God's family. Officially joining a particular denomination will not make you any closer to God than you were on the day you were saved. It simply states that you intent to be loyal to that particular church.<br>  <br>  It is fine to go solo to a new church. You don't need family connections or friends there.  Preferably sit close to other people on your first visit so that you will be noticed. People will probably speak to you at the end of the service and make you feel welcome. If you sit in isolation at the back or in a corner you might not be spotted and then, if no one comes to talk to you you might feel, wrongly, that they were not welcoming.|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Drive around your town find some churches. Then go on Sunday's, meet and greet some pastors and some of the congregation until you find out what works for you. You don't need a "family" to have been in the church to go. You can praise God anyway. Don't be discouraged by one churches turn-offs.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck<br>  I'll pray that you find a Great and Honest Church. =]
ry3yUnoaaa	Being a member of AKA doesn't mean that you have to know how to dance or step because only certain members of the chapter do it. I know chapters that don't step at all. If you do become a member in the future, you will have the choice of whether or not you want to participate in stepping. No all probates aren't the same. Like I said earlier I know chapters that have don't even have a probate show when they intake new members.

We are all of same "race", the human race, <br>  descended from Adam.<br>  <br>  <br>  The King James Version was translated by man, and is an imperfect translation, just as any other translation is imperfect.  By her logic, is should be a sin to read ANY translation, and everyone should learn to read the original greek and hebrew scripture.|`|sGojEWOxaa	No, it is not a sin to mix races.  I think some people misunderstand what the meaning was in the old testament, when God wanted His people to only marry "their own people"<br>  Leviticus 21:14<br>  A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.<br>  <br>  But what is meant by this is that He wants us to marry believers.<br>  He does not want us to be married to someone who does not believe in Him.<br>  <br>  I believe that the King James version is the best bible to read, but I do not believe that a person will be lost if they do not read that version.<br>  I think that it is the purest form, and the most correct interpretation that we have, but some of the other versions make things easier to read and (sometimes) understand.|`|VgC5ip1xaa	Wow, she has problems.

Of the remarriage of widows, the apostle Paul wrote: “A wife is bound during all the time her husband is alive. But if her husband should fall asleep in death, she is free to be married to whom she wants, only in the Lord.” (1?Cor. 7:39) Thus the Christian is free to marry anyone who is Scripturally and legally free to do so, as long as that one is truly a fellow believer.<br>  <br>  It is not a sin to read another translation of the Bible. Just make sure it is a reliable translation. <br>  The purpose of Bible translation, then, is to take these thoughts of God, originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and put them into the common languages of today. Bible translation makes God’s Book a living Book. So true Christians read the Bible, not to be entertained by clever turns of expression, unusual words, excellency of style, striking rhetorical devices or felicities of rhythm, but to learn the will of God. It was for this reason that the King James Version came into existence. That was in 1611.<br>  To the surprise of many people the King James Bible has already been changed; today no one reads the King James Version in its original form. Explaining why this is so the book The Bible in Its Ancient and English Versions says: “Almost every edition, from the very beginning, introduced corrections and unauthorized changes and additions, often adding new errors in the process. The edition of 1613 shows over three hundred differences from 1611. .?.?. It was in the eighteenth century, however, that the main changes were made. .?.?. The marginal references were checked and verified, over 30,000 new marginal references were added, the chapter summaries and running headnotes were thoroughly revised, the punctuation was altered and made uniform in accordance with modern practice, textual errors were removed, the use of capitals was considerably modified and reduced, and a thorough revision made in the form of certain kinds of words."|`|IIhiSprlaa	No, now MYOB|`|VWvI5RyBaa	In my opinion, the sinner is your best friend's mom.  She's totally racist.  God doesn't see colours, He sees His children.  I'm a very religious person and I would never stop my children from marrying a person from another race.  I would be more concerned about my children's happiness.  God loves all of us.  I have the official Catholic Bible and  I wouldn't tell your best friend's mother that she can't read her Bible without sinning.  She is really narrow minded, isn't she?  I'll pray for her. Your poor friend, it must be hard to have a mother so judgemental.|`|7cLYgf2raa	The bible tells us in acts that all men are of one blood. God never refers to races.

I wrote that letter and have copies of the record of Ted Bundy's posthumous baptism and endowment, which occurred on May 28, 2008 in the Jordan River Utah Temple, owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Salt Lake City Weekly also has copies of the record of Bundy's 2008 temple ordinances. <br>  <br>  Bundy's listing is longer online at Fanily Search. As soon as the story of Bundy's baptism went public on February 10, 2009, Bundy's record immediately disappeared from the Mormon database of posthumous ordinances. <br>  <br>  Ted Bundy was baptized under a misleading name, Theodore Robert Cowell. Cowell may have been his birth name, but it was legally changed to Bundy when he was about five. Theodore Robert Bundy, who became better known as Ted Bundy, was his name for most of his life. The Mormon submitter probably used the name Theodore Robert Cowell to conceal Bundy's criminal identity in the Mormon temple system.|`|YnGIccE8aa	Searching familysearch.org is a fruitless prospect.

I am sure that Ted has been baptized NUMEROUS times. <br>  <br>  However, they are not to judge who is worthy in God's eyes of eternal salvation, or in this case: who gets to be God of his own planet and have many wives who spend eternity giving birth to spirit babies.

HBp5r76haa	Whoever says they have found Jesus are right but also wrong. <br>  You have found the truth - in fact He is the way, the TRUTH and the life, but you will never cease to "seek" Him, as in lay your life down for Him.<br>  <br>  Paul says:<br>  "1Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship. 2Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."Romans 12:1-2<br>  <br>  Then He tells us how to do so:<br>  "clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature." Romans 13:14<br>  <br>  Seeking Jesus is seeking to be holy as He is Holy. And to do so, I need to know Him.<br>  <br>  Why do I seek Him? My motivation comes from His mercy and His love. He is the best friend I could possibly want. And "greater friend has no one that this, that he lay down his life for his friends".<br>  He died for me. This is a good enough motive for me.|`|FBrwlhPtaa	This reminds my of a song by Tenth Avenue North "By Your Side"<br>  <br>  Why are you striving these days<br>  Why are you trying to earn grace<br>  Why are you crying<br>  Let me lift up your face<br>  Just don't turn away<br>  <br>  Why are you looking for love<br>  Why are you still searching as if I'm not enough<br>  To where will you go child<br>  Tell me where will you run<br>  To where will you run<br>  <br>  And I'll be by your side<br>  Wherever you fall<br>  In the dead of night<br>  Whenever you call<br>  And please don't fight<br>  These hands that are holding you<br>  My hands are holding you<br>  <br>  Look at these hands and my side<br>  They swallowed the grave on that night<br>  When I drank the world's sin<br>  So I could carry you in<br>  And give you life<br>  I want to give you life<br>  <br>  (Chorus 2x)<br>  <br>  Cause I, I love you<br>  I want you to know<br>  That I, I love you<br>  I'll never let you go<br>  <br>  (Chorus 2x)|`|DB9QbZoQaa	It is all vary simple:<br>  In the beginning The Creator made man in His image, the Satan complained out of jealously and made a issue of it in Heaven- so The Creator tossed Satan and all Satan's followers out.<br>  Satan hates man and so he preceded to bring harm to man; continues to do so today.<br>  The Creator in order to save us from our self and the Law sent The Christ, if one is not seeking The Christ they will be lost just as Satan and his followers will be.<br>  <br>  Indeed I do seek Jesus.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Your question is inconsistent with the remarks that follow it.|`|AA10192697	I'm none of those. I have already found Him.|`|lJUyhMceaa	Your logic is flawed from the start.  There are four types of people.<br>  <br>  #4  Those who have found Jesus.<br>  <br>  I"m #4<br>  <br>  Just because the message you refere to says that we will always be searching for Jesus, does not make it so.<br>  <br>  The following verse says there is coming a time when some people will know Jesus.<br>  <br>  Heb 8:11  And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. <br>  <br>  1Jn 2:3  And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. <br>  <br>  I could give you a number of other verses that refere to knowing Christ.<br>  <br>  The fact is...regardless of what the sermon says...it is possible to both know Jesus, and to find Him.  He lives within each of us that have trusted Him as Saviour.  Jesus is not hiding.  He wants everyone to seek and find Him.|`|483a6c92920a69c48f6085fae23a4618aa	I used to think I needed Jesus but I left when I realised Christianity did'nt suit me.

97031ab5ff9bcf387a9d1278f60ddafeaa	It was not a wise thing for either of you. But, not knowing all the circumstances (like if his wife and children were home) I will not second guess his actions.|`|zyxY4dbMaa	I have not yet seen any of these so called Christians offer you any help or compassion.<br>  <br>  Are you OK?<br>  <br>  did you ever get the counsel that you so badly needed?|`|DapNp1Kxaa	Yeah, if you and your husband fought, you should not have gone to an elders home at that hour by yourself. You put both of you in a bad situation, but he should have arranged for another elder to be present. He probably didn't realize that your conversation would last as long as it did. Without knowing if your husband is in the truth or not, it's hard to say exactly how the situation should have been handled. Certainly, if your husband is a brother, both of you should be involved in your ccounseling I think if it had been me, I would have called a sister to whom I felt close, or a family member at that hour, not go to an elders house in the wee hours of the morning. He might not have wanted to waken someone for what he thought was a short conversation, one that could be finished at a better time. If your life was in danger, you should have gone to the police, not an elder. Elders have been killed for getting in the middle of domestic disputes. Technically, tho, you are correct, there should have been another elder there, but practically speaking, the lateness of the hour likely made it difficult to call.|`|AA12073868	I wouldn't have gone to an elder's home over an argument. That would be a silly thing to do.<br>  <br>   It would be inappropriate for the brother to do so by himself which is why it's such a silly thing to do and why your claim is, at least, suspicious. <br>  <br>   Was this brother married and if so where was his wife?  <br>  <br>  Why would YOU go there at that time over some silly fight?<br>  <br>   Sorry but this "question" smells of "storytelling." That's why others are having such difficulties accepting it.|`|8Ddi57v2aa	3 a.m. in the morning is not a appropriate time to go to another man's house.  He must have been semi conscious and can't recall nothing you said.  But if he asked you inappropriate questions all alone; he should be reprimanded.  Some times man take advantage on vulnerable women.  Be careful and use your better judgment.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Yeah, not a good idea....<br>  <br>  When you've had an upset with your husband, seek a female friend and a nice cup of coffee.<br>  <br>  If you want to seek marital counseling from an elder...attend WITH your husband.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Why did you go to the elders house at 2 a.m. alone anyway? <br>  And why didn't you tell him that you felt it was inappropriate?<br>  <br>  It's true that it's inadvisable for elders to counsel sisters alone. However, if you chose an elder that lived alone, maybe he was just trying to calm you down if you were irrate after an argument. It would have been wise to choose a married elder, or at least tell him that you would like another elder to accompany him|`|xyZfaHHHaa	Elders are not perfect. The real question is "Why did you go to his house at 2am? Why not make a call? And Why not wait till morning?" Elders are not there to solve your marital problems. Advise you yes, but they are not police we do not run to them at any given hour. If you didn't take the proper steps and was not thinking at the time...maybe you threw him off so he wasn't either. <br>  <br>  If you felt uncomfortable remember...you put yourself at his house. Imagine how he feels.|`|oen1tuyTaa	Its not often I agree with Porcelain but she is bang on...why did you seek to go there rather than a friend?<br>  I don't think its inappropriate that he chatted to you for an hour, surely as an elder he has some responsibility to his followers.<br>  Perhaps you're being paranoid (a common trait) and he was just doing his job.<br>  You yourself will know if his intentions were not right and if so stop going there...<br>  <br>  Go to a real marriage counsellor instead...elders are not trained to counsel for marriages in trouble|`|DTFsNJxpaa	I use to be a Jehovah's Witness. The incident that you said happened was not appropriate. Only because it was 3 am, and in a private setting. You also should not have been alone. Imagine, you get into a fight and scream 'John helped me more than you did!'. all bad. You know how gossip flies - you should come clean.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	He is a human...if your desesperation was so big that you have to go at that  hour....Why do you expect he would do the normal protocol...when you are not under a normal situation??<br>  <br>  Why you went at 2:00 Am to his house??|`|HItbioaMaa	It was totally inappropriate. It should also be reported to your Body of Elders.|`|CcHUacLPaa	You answered you own question he should have called another brother and your husband. Why? Jesus said in Matt 18:16 ...take along with you one or two more, in order that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter may be established. Verse 20: For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.” The word of God states clearly what you must do, this keeps Satan from getting into the conversation. It is inappropriate to meet anyone at that hour of the day. If it was a matter of abuse or battery we have police to handle that sort of thing.

A formal email is a request for a formal reply. An informal reply is a request for an informal email style.<br>  <br>  The exception is when you get a rude email. This requires a polite response because a polite response is the mark of a professional and that stands out where others are tempted to respond unprofessionally. So don't send an email that could come back to bite you.<br>  <br>  This is the time to ask questions so that you can get to know the culture and customs of the workplace. Is there a hierarchy or is it consensus driven? Asking that sort of question shows that you are culturally sensitive to the needs of other people. However there is no need to go to the other extreme and appear obsequious.|`|rThIVk2maa	Keep calling her Ms until she says "Please, call me Shelly"

In other words, I would not have a programmed death of old age, but could still be offed by accident or my own hand.<br>  <br>  I imagine I would choose to live about 200 years, and then I would probably "let myself go".  It depends on how things were progressing. It's likely that most of us would be very psychically tired after a long life, and maybe really bored.

BzrUWCsDaa	Adam & Eve were created perfect, to live forever. Because they disobeyed God they introduced imperfection into their genes & all their offspring have inherited this from them. Immediately when they disobeyed, God set up a means whereby all of their offspring could have the chance of having back what they lost for us... perfection & eternal life on earth. He sent his son down to us to buy back what Adam lost.

However, I know someone that can redeem you, and you will never have to pay that price, that everyone deserves to pay. JESUS died on the cross to save us from the sin that we all commit. ALL have sinned and fall short of His glory, and the wages of sin is death, BUT the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.|`|AA11002471	Haven't got a clue why anyone would pray for Eve's sin, However there is something called family responsibility.<br>  If your father dies with $10,000.00 on his credit card, guess who they will come after?<br>  Any generation you point to is affected by their predecessors.<br>  Why are you an American (if you are)?<br>  Its because one of your ancestors moved from their homeland.<br>  Otherwise, you might be German, or Norwegian.<br>  What previous generations do affects us, like it or not.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Jesus died for all sins.<br>  <br>  Each person goes through the proverbial garden of Eden...and ultimately fails the test.

The question is whether or not you are accountable! Yes you most certainly are! Why? Because Adam and Eve did not have a Holy nature to bequeath to their prodigy.

Although the media give the impression that it is a major concern it is only a very small percentage of the youth that are involved. To bring in the army would only increase the "street cred" of the gangs and could encourage further disorder with all the youth, including the current moderate ones, feeling threatened by a fine body of men that are trained to fight not to be diplomats.

Perfectly ordinary citizens are an extremely effective deterrent to random violence except in places where the 'bad guys" have been promised by government they will meet no effective resistance.<br>  This is no mystery and is borne out true over thousands of years of human history. Your government knows this. The crime level is a SUCCESSFUL government program designed to incline the masses to accepting moves like having the Army patrol the streets. Free men do not accept such things until frightened into surrendering their natural sovereignty to abusive State authorities.<br>  The message this really sends is that freedom will not be tolerated.<br>  Citizens are free to go about armed.

Seems like the whole world is becoming a police state, don't it???|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	I disagree.<br>  The Police can do an excellent job if they had support from the courts.<br>  <br>  The troops aren't trained to handle drunks and jobs,it would probably lead to battles with the local half-wits.<br>  I fail to see how they could prevent it anyway,the yobs with knives don't actually go round slashing people in full view of authority.<br>  Recruit more full-time coppers instead and cut down on the paper work they have to do|`|728ad832a4b0e8e5114f6f26c4463796aa	i agree anything to stop murders|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	i disagree. what they should do is put guns back into the hands of law-abiding citizens so that they can defend themselves|`|86907ad9cce026f929aa1445843edac4aa	buy the daily mail tomorrow /they know best|`|3VXGLhnMaa	Our troops have enough to do without patrolling streets.What are the residents doing?|`|u18GBKmiaa	yeah they would kick some order into this country lol|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	Calling in the Army is a scary thing.  I say this because I remember what happened during hurricane Katrina.  Law abiding citizens that stayed to protect their property were forced to surrender their weapons.  Those weapons were then tossed in multiple barrels and left to rust.  They were not tagged with the owners name and were left to rust  I realize this isn't the case in your country but martial law is scary for the law abiding citizens.  All it takes is one or two military on a power trip to cause as much harm.  This works the same in police departments as well.<br>  Since the right to protect and defend oneself was taken away for the citizens of that country it just opened the door for bad guys to run wild, holding peaceful and law abiding citizens hostage.  Have there been hard statistics that say the murder rate has decreased since firearms were ordered to be surrendered?  Yes a knife can kill just like a gun but it's my opinion that instead of calling in the Army serious changes need to be brought about.  Like more police patrol and campaign to change the law that took away your freedom to defend yourself from thugs.  Just my opinion.|`|knVy3zIHaa	I go to school in Croydon, and live not so far away.<br>  Its very extreme i think, you just need to give kids the right information about knives, and teach them what is right before their allowed on the streets. And you should give them the protection, so they don't feel they need to carry a knife, and target groups of youths and teach them as one.|`|wnsFO3GCaa	I am completely against it. While the stabbings are terrible occurrences they are certainly not severe enough to warrant martial law. I am not happy about giving the military that kind of power, they are not trained to police their own population.

I didn't know it was retroactive.<br>  <br>  OH!  BROADBAND!  Huh...Now that sounds like a boy issue.<br>  <br>  Honestly Suz, I have no idea.  We're on Satellite and it's terrible.|`|u18GBKmiaa	HD is amazing as long as you've got a decent size TV you will notice the difference and yeah virging is ok in my opinion its cheaper then sky|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Do you have to be a virgin? How can they tell?  Poppy|`|AA11296212	My virgin is virgin mobile.|`|DJLeObm4aa	Not got HD but have mobile, landline, TV,Broadband. I say about 97% happy with Virgin with exception of the mobile 'phone. I am at constant war with Virgin regarding this. Get all sorts of emails advising if you pay X amount you will get a bundle of eg 300 free texts. Doesn't come when advised and then forward it when there is hardly any time left prior to the deadline for using it. Advice? Go for the package one offer but definitely NOT their mobile phone.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Yes, the difference in internet speed alone is worth the investment.  I did not get the phone package but use a Vontage adapter on the computer and find the service great and price reasonable.  HD TV seems to make a difference, but our TV set is modest in size.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	I don't have HD, I don't really watch that much TV apart from football.<br>  The broadband seems to get good reports and I've had no complaints, If you get the XL package you also get free anti-virus and anti-malware|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Just swapped to BT Wireless our Suzie,don,t know the other. x
npTZTzWRaa	they were African|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	Hun first of all Ethiopian is the same thing as African or darker skined people or Black people. Whatever you want to call, that is who was on the planet first. Bottom line is, the people you are talking about are black people and the are a part of Africa.<br>   (keep in mind,all black people have very different features)<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  I suggest you reconize|`|x5ZaTKF8aa	The last time I checked dark skin is dominant(as opposed to recessive) and Ethiopia is in Africa, so how are Caucasoid the first humans? Causasoids are from the Caucas mountains bordering Europe.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	OK,  let's slow down a little.  The out of Africa theory is only theory,  remember that.   It is not scientifically considered an absolute truth nor does it say even though the skulls were in Africa that they are the skulls of blacks.  Now consider that the skulls we are talking about are only a few hundred thousand years old but yet our primate lineage goes back over 15 million years in a continuing chain of evolutionary events.  So we are only talking about what is referred to as Homo Sapien who basically replaced our relatives like the Neanderthal,  Homo Habilis,  Homo Erectus, etc.  The likely scenario is that we all come from different branches off the same tree,  with each race containing their own version of Homo Sapien.|`|Fu1emcF3aa	I thought the first humans were australoids.... Or were they the first humans to leave Africa?|`|sFjYVH7paa	Only if Ethiopia existed as a country 195,000 [sic] years ago.  I have never been there or then but I am pretty sure the first humans had no governmental boundaries.<br>  <br>  ps. anyone can put anything on this site too.
bb06GQ5Paa	Good gracious!  What is going on today!  Everybody's just at each other's throats today.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	I don't want a white history month or channel. It just gets obnoxious when some want all these extras but if whites do they get their stuff in a wad.|`|ncdTxID9aa	White people in real life don't complain about this nonsense as people do on here.  I think many Whites agree, most television stations feature Whites, history of Europeans, White Americans, etc is in depth through out history. Blacks aren't the only ones with a History month either.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.archives.gov/eeo/special-observances/#may" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.gov/eeo/special-obse...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  also how about posting a question not ranting|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	yes most TV is white. thats because right now most people in US are white. and the only reason people advocate having WET or white history month is to, in a backwards way, protest BET and black history month.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	lol...yeah but I hate BET but I do like the show Hell Date kind of funny.<br>  <br>  I do see your point.<br>  Black people have one dumb channel and they call that racism LOL.|`|AA12205301	I don't feel we need a BET channel or black history month. Neither do we need WET or white history month. The point is that other colors want certain things just for them, yet when whites want the same we are called racist  and we get taken to court to allow the others in our thing. I have seen black only pageants, yet have not seen a white person taking them to court to get their white daughters in the pageant. I have seen black clubs, hispanic clubs, gay clubs in school, but try to have a white only or a religious club and it is taken to court. It is a double standard. And that is what we are fighting against. Other "minorities" are allowed to have their private clubs etc, but a white private club is not allowed. I saw on the news today where ACORN was wanting the people they help (minorities) to be able to stay in their homes even when not paying mortgages, yet they are not asking for this for whites who are not being helped by them. This is a double standard. Not only do they want them to stay in the homes, they want us working citizens to pay for them. We as whites get tired of being called racist when we try to have something for ourselves, we get sued.  But it is ok for other minorities to have their things to themselves without anyone having a problem with it.   The channels on tv are not black or white. They show movies etc of all colors. Yet blacks have their BET.  We do not have a white history year.  Black history is taught alongside white history.  Quit whining yoursef!  How about this... There was a teacher, well qualified and experiences (white male) going up for a teaching position. They hired a young, inexperienced black female for the position and then asked the well qualified teacher to come in and train her. Yet when the training was over, he would not have a job.  So what does that tell you about equality. It tells me that affirmitive action is crap.  Hire someone who has no clue what they are doing, yet not hire the one who is qualified and experienced.|`|4Za1utmCaa	Unlike the term "Black", the term "White", as it is used in America, is not defined by ethnicity. In fact, the term White has more to do with a lack of ethnicity, thus making it just a race term synonymous with caucasian. So a WET channel really makes no sense because there wouldn't be much to discuss and view in regards to programming due to a lack of ethnic definition. I suppose the show could explore ethnicities such as Irish, German, Italian, etc, which are ethnic groups mostly made up of white people, but I just don't see it happening.|`|a6wPnHRQaa	I think it's funny that some complain they should get a W.E.T channel cause B.E.T is owned by Viacom which is owned by........ <br>  <br>  <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/web2007/view/e_spkr/3809" rel="nofollow">http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/web...</a><br>  <br>  lmao a WHITE man, he created b.e.t, It's just of course run by blacks cause obviously they know the music & things more.

I think any research about it by definition would be mostly descriptive and would not have statistically significant results (studying a population of people who don't want to be outed or of people who were in but came out).<br>  <br>  I expect that any study would indicate that people in the closet for whatever reason and whether they are on the DL are more likely to have anxiety and depression and more likely to have self-destructive behaviours, including a higher probability of suicide and higher risk of STDs.|`|N73oZyY8aa	It's living a lie, and lies compound.

That is not an example of cocky America (not to say that we aren't ... just that you had a poor example).

EBqFpZbjaa	Hugh Grant's quality of English is very high.  He looks and sounds like a member of the middle to upper-middle class, probably public school educated to the very highest standard.<br>  <br>  There are two clear English accents here in England, there is the Northern English and the Southern English - both are classified as posh - well spoken.<br>  <br>  It is always a good idea when learning English, to have some knowledge of different accents if possible.<br>  <br>  Here is a very famous English actor, a movie star in fact and someone you might already know of.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXJ-oAq2XZg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXJ-oAq2X...</a><br>  <br>  The two men in the above video clip are, Michael Parkinson and Michael Caine - Parkinson has a northern accent and Caine has a London [Cockney] accent.<br>  <br>  Here then is the very highest quality English ever spoken upon a stage.

If you want to learn a 'proper' English accent then I'd say he's one of your best people to copy. There's also well spoken people like Kate Winslet...Patrick Stewart ( He has a great accent. Very sexy.)<br>  <br>  There are many regional accents amougnst the British countries. Hugh Grant is a minority. It would be great if you learnt to speak in a Welsh, Irish, or Scottish accent. Try Scottish ! Lol! I would be biast because I am Scottish though. There are some very clear Scottish accents...but also one's I don't even understand! I wouldn't stick to just learning off of Hugh Grant...Take inspiration from all of these English speakers in films and things you come accross...Trust me, the majority of us Brits don't speak like Hugh Grant! :)|`|63c29d0e010c46bcc8d52695123cb4beaa	I rate his speach as excellent.|`|6701f7106e5be82f05306047c5a9c5e8aa	I like his speech and pronunciation, he  speaks well.|`|9q95w6vyaa	mmmble bmmmble<br>  <br>  (mumble bumble)|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	Hugh Grant..poncey. It's ok for learning basic English skills but for everyday use if you talked like that up North you would likely get called a "Southern fairy" and be given what is politely called "some shoe".<br>  <br>  If you like the Northern accent, look for a film called "Kes".|`|ckxpknr0aa	He's definitely a bit posh but it won't hurt to speak like him!!
2b5799147194d19d72182c8e2216fa41aa	Thank you for asking this question, I think this is something that is important for us all to consider. I know that the Lord had to break down a lot of barriers in me and wrong traditions concerning things that I thought were masculine and manly. Before I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour, I thought of myself as a strong man. Strength was one of the things that I thought defined being a man, not just strength, but I thought the strength came from the person, that a strong person wouldn’t need anyone else. I thought it was a weakness to need others, and I thought it was a weakness to be vulnerable.  I wouldn't let my feelings show, I really suppressed them and hardened my heart to the point that I couldn't really feel right emotions anymore. I was full of hate and pride, and I tried to exert my will on others just about everywhere I went. I didn't do things that I thought were " sissified " and was so stubborn I never wanted to admit I was wrong even when I knew I was. The ideas I had of being a man came from a lot of different places, our culture, media, examples of people that I seen around me, and also those things that are inside a person,( our own images of ourselves that we would like to project to others) and not knowing Jesus Christ the Truth, I was subject to many of the lies of the enemy. And so I accepted so many of those lies as truth and held them deep inside of me, and  I allowed how the world views things dictate who I was, and how I seen these things, even what defined being a man.<br>  <br>  After I accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour He did change me, and in how I viewed being a man, and what is important is some of the areas that He did change in me. The Lord began to break down those walls that were inside of me, and to take those wrong traditions that I had received away from me. It is amazing how God makes us such a contradiction to what we once were! The things I used to hate I now love, the things I used to love I now hate. The things I seen as weakness, I see as strength, the things that I thought were strength I now know are weaknesses. The strongest man that I know is Jesus Christ, He is the example to us all, there is none stronger than He, there is none that can excel Him in any area. We can look at Jesus and follow Him with our whole heart,  surrendering all to Him, and He teaches us how to be a man, the man that He created us to be in Him. And it is Jesus in us that enables us to walk His will in our life, we can't do it on our own.<br>  <br>  I used to think that crying was a sign of weakness, there was a time I didn't feel like I could cry, I thank God that I can cry now, and I desire for the Lord to pour His love and compassion in me more all the time.<br>  I see and know now that not being able to feel was the real weakness, I was like a dried up branch, dead and without life. But in Christ I am one of His branches abiding in Him. I thought I did things by my own strength, but in confessing that I was foolish and weak. The truth is we can’t do anything without the Lord, it is by Him that we have each breath and it is by Him that we live and are able to move and have our being. ( Acts 17:28 ) I now confess that I can't do anything without Jesus, and I look to Him for the strength to do all things, and having Jesus Christ as your Rock is a solid foundation, anyone who doesn't have their life in Jesus, has built their life on the sand, and no matter how strong it looks on the outside, it will fall without Jesus Christ. ( Matthew 7:24-27 )<br>  <br>  I believe that true strength comes from the Lord, and our strength comes from acknowledging that we are weak, and fully depending and trusting in the Lord with all of our heart, strength, soul and mind. If we say that we are strong because of our own strength, we are foolish, and will fall, but if we confess our weakness to the Lord and lean on Him, surrender to Him, that is how we stand, He is Everlasting Strength. ( Isaiah 26:4 )<br>  <br>  <br>  2 Corinthinans 12:9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br>  <br>  So many of the things that I didn’t value before and seen as weakness, I now see the value of them, and treasure them, desire them and see them as strength and wisdom. Love, kindness, patience, humility, meekness, longsuffering, mercy, truth, faith, compassion, and holiness are some of those things. I believe that these things should be in all of us as believers both men and women, and I see them as precious and worth having.<br>  <br>  I am not as concerned about what appears to be masculine or manly to others, what I desire the most is to be the man that God created me to be, and a man after His own heart, to be completely surrendered to Him, to serve Him with all my might and strength, with sincerity, in holiness, glorifying God with both my body and spirit which belong to Him. To have the things that are important to God being important to me also, to be formed and transformed not by the standards of the world or how others view me, but by the word of God and by His Spirit, to be found doing His will. To be pleasing to the Lord, instead of trying to please people. <br>  <br>  Philippians 3: 7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.<br>   8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,<br>   9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:<br>   10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; <br>  <br>  I appreciate you asking this question, it is one that I feel is so important. It opened up the discussion on how we view what being a “ man “ is,  people will have their own standards, and their own rules that they measure people by. The people that are of the world will continue to see the things of God as foolishness or weakness, until their eyes are opened. But we as God’s children  we must not be conformed to the world, but should be transformed by the renewing of our mind, that we may prove what is that good, acceptable and perfect will of God. ( Romans 12:2 ) Let us not allow the world to teach us who to be, but look to Jesus Christ, Who is the example for us all,  men and women both young and old, He is our example and teaches us who we are, and who we should be in Him. <br>  <br>  Luke 9:23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. <br>  <br>  With much love and sincerity in Jesus Christ my Lord,<br>  andrew|`|ljzb6fZBaa	10 for a man who prays, does Bible study and communion with God. Jesus Himself is the Man's Man - and He is totally dependent on the Father's love. He is not afraid to cry nor does He shy away from carrying babies. Instead, He embraced little children who came to Him and blessed them. A real man has meekness and majesty, strength and compassion. "What is desired of a man is kindness" (Proverbs 19:22), not intelligence, not power, not status, not popularity, not wealth. "The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, and his glory is to overlook a transgression." (Proverbs 19:11)<br>  <br>  A manly man is not like what Hollywood movies portrays, like James Bond or Don Juan. A real man stays faithful to one wife after marriage, and does not sleep around. "Most men will proclaim each his own goodness, but who can find a faithful man?" (Proverbs 20:6)<br>  <br>  Thanks for the insightful question, and God bless you, brother. :)|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	Giving up your power to another is, by definition, non manly.

Nco7uM0gaa	There are several reasons why kids today are such brats,and one of them is the parents are afraid to discipline their children because they can be accused and arrested for child abuse if they lay a hand on them.My kids are 47 & 48 years old,and knew that if the misbehaved in public they would pay for it.My late wife and I both worked full time,but my kids were never latch key kids until they were 14 years old.Unfortunately the law has forced parents to go back to the old spare the rod and spoil the child way raising their kids.I don't buy into the old "we both work" cop out. There are a lot of parents who just do not care how their kids behave also.My Dad always took a belt to me when I acted up,and it never hurt the way I turned out.I did the same to both my kids and they both turned out just fine.Too bad all parents don't use the old school method.Keep on being "old school".It pays off in the end.|`|XbZIicftaa	It does seem to me that people are afraid to discipline their children, because of the reasons you said and also they're probably afraid of being judged.  <br>  My mom was way more strict though, so I'm with you on this one.  I don't know if it's a general trend (I'm only 25), but I don't plan on letting my kids get away with anything ;)|`|BnistnrIaa	just way easier to ignore cause it takes alot out of parents emotionally to discipline and we live in such a stressful world at least right now. BUT not the better way out that's for sure<br>  <br>  Edit: I agree with Sky C! My mom would of slapped my mouth if I said some of the stuff I hear today lol|`|UOIcXs7Haa	That is why there are so many disrespectful little shite hawks running around these days, I would've been walloped for behaving like that and to be quite honest it doesn't do any harm.|`|2DRWQxP3aa	wow. If I misbehaved my mother would smack me down and tell me in a firm, almost evil voice, to behave.|`|9UNsd4Vtaa	I think a lot of it has to do with both parents working till they are beat and too tired to deal.  The stress levels today on families are enormous.<br>  <br>  No excuse for allow poor behavior in public though.  My mom was a teacher and my dad a Marine and we darn well better have behaved in public.  I remember once at the base grocery store I was being a brat and my dad took me outside made me stand at point of attention and tell everyone going in the store that I didn't know how to behave and to have a nice day.  Then I had to help anyone coming out of the store load their items in the car.  I had to do that for four weekends, rather then play or spend time with my friends.  Was really embarassing when a friend would show up with their parents.   So humilating.  <br>  <br>  But I too am old school.  I stay home and raise the kids,  online school, soccer, karate, etc take care of the house and cook real meals, along with the administrative part of our business.|`|AuxlgxjBaa	I own a toy and game store so I see the worst of the worst.  Parents who drop jr. off with me while the go all over the malls shopping and little jr. tears up my store. Meanwhile, mom doesn't want to pay for opened products and damages so she causes a stink and rushes out without so much as a "Im sorry"   What has jr. learned from this?   not a darn thing.  I tell my employees....."its hard to decide who to slap, the kids or the parents"   I think part of it is parents dont want to deal with the social rehab programs that take the kids (or threaten to) if they see any kind of mark on the child.  <br>  <br>  I spanked my kids (on a regular basis it felt like) and they NEVER got in trouble for the same thing twice|`|EyCgjjV4aa	i think a lot of people just go sheepish when it comes to their kids. The get to rembering all the times they were hurt or pissed at their parents. but they 4 get that they still go over for christmas, to hang with the parents. You hae to be in control of ur kids or you will be a joke and so will everything u say. The last time i was in the siduation where this girl was being soooo obnoxious to her mom and everyone else in walmart, i stoped my cart, and pointed her out and said, Look kids<to mine> theres what i dont want you to look like in public. Public embarassment is effective. My girl knows if u act up in public ill snatch that phone outta ur hand and give u a toung lashing, as were leaving the store and all the stuff in our cart. Make time to parent, make time to be friends, btu dont confuse the issue with your kids. In a army the privates listen to the genrals..|`|dDprsKZYaa	It's not just you.<br>  I work in retail and I am constantly appalled at what parents let their children get away with these days.<br>  It's not just a matter of unruly behavior, either. Many of these kids are downright destructive. Broken toys, torn open packages and total disregard for other people seem to be accepted by these parents as normal childhood behavior.<br>  <br>  Of course, then it's society's fault when their little angel grows up to be a delinquent.|`|vEobDY1haa	there is so much confusion with the "positive re-direction" method. its SUPPOSED to help re-enforce good behavior above bad behavior.<br>  like instead of spanking or yelling, tell the child "hey lets do this instead".<br>  <br>  I learned best when my mom got down to my level and said, "knock it off, or when you get home you are going straight to your room and you wont be able to come to the store with me next time."|`|SmFcDx4waa	yup I agree! I don't know how these parents seem to forget that it is their RESPONSIBILITY to raise these kids and teach them how to function in society - maybe its easy for them to ignore while their kids are small, but then they will be all confused when the kid is grown up a bit and getting in all sorts of trouble because they think they can do whatever they want... rediculous.|`|L0UjqOAwaa	I've certainly noticed a change in the attitude of children, as a result of lapsed parenting, i'm 19 and my younger sisters are thankfully with morals and values, but SO many children their age really have not been brought up well at all. The attitude towards children and amount of effective parenting has deteriorated immensly i think! <br>  I can only hope the worse generation that comes about as a result will reverse the situation.<br>  Stupid lazy parents =[|`|O8n3FYK0aa	Well, I'm not a parent but I totally agree with you there. It seems that standard for behavior these days is, instead of being at the ceiling, it's closer to the floor. People don't seem to care any more. It's somewhat discouraging, but the least we can do is be a positive influence on them. Thanks for asking.|`|PrRNMDXRaa	i think that parents like that are just lazy.. i cant stand when parents ignore they're kids misbehaving|`|MnFj47dxaa	I completely agree with you!  Parents seem to just be lazy.  Whether it's the fact that both parents have to work, and the kids are in crappy daycare centers (because they can't afford some place better) and this is where they learn things... or if it's because parents don't care, or can't bother themselves to spend the time disciplining and following through with appropriate reactions when kids misbehave... who knows.  I am not yet a parent, but hope my judgement doesn't lapse when I am to the point that my children are raised to act that way.  One thing that really drives me crazy is parents who are walking through a public place and let their children wander around to the point that other people are practically tripping over them, and the parents do nothing about it.  That really irks me.|`|UMYda9Jaaa	I agree. In a lot of ways, children are more out of control than when we were young. I think there are several reasons for this. One is that parents are far more busy than they used to be. Both parents are working and involved in social activities, caring for homes, involved in children's schooling, etc. and they don't have energy to teach the little ones who should be at the top of that list.<br>  <br>  Also, parenting historically moves in cycles. Those who were raised very strictly tend to resent that to some degree and will be more lax with their children. While parents are being told not to spank or be harsh, they are not at the same time being given realistic ways of punishing inappropriate behavior and since parents are too tired and busy to come up with creative parenting techniques on their own, chidren run amok.|`|AA11627889	I used to be given a short speech in a low tone from my father about how we better behave when we're going out, otherwise we're going home. He didn't want to be embarrassed by one of his own unruly kids. If we did act up, boy were we in trouble. Nowadays, I think it depends. Some parents really are just lazy. They really don't get what a pain their kid is being. Others believe that the kids are only acting up because they want attention, so if the kids are ignored then they'll stop. Others want to discipline their children, but are afraid of any backlash that may occur. There doesn't seem to be alot you can do these days, particularly involving children, that strangers won't have something to say about it, whether amongst themselves or worse, to the actual parents. I'm sure there are people who believe that if they punish their child now, the child will always remember and hate them for it, but really I'm afraid of the children that aren''t disciplined, how they're going to turn out as adults being brought up with no boundaries.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No where I live.. We have some great parents were we live...LOL!<br>  <br>  Oh wait.. yes I am lying..I hardly ever see a parent that gives a damn!|`|5RhDnLHLaa	i valenteer for a summer camp at the ywca for a whole summer  it's for 6-9 year olds,<br>  <br>  and only 3 of them were good, my boss, she could not really do anything but raise her voice at them because she not their parents, <br>  <br>  my mom teaches dance class there, and she could not handle them too<br>  <br>  my sister and brother also valenteer there, but my brother does green screen in stuff.<br>  <br>  but it's not that parents that don't watch over their kids, it's just some parents or shopping or working and they don't know whats going on|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	I guess it depends.  If my any of my kids are crying or being obnoxious at the store, I ignore them.  They're only doing it so we'll leave the store.  Leaving and acknowledging that behaviour will reinforce it.  If they're doing something that bothers others, we deal with it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  For the record, my kids would be in the cart.  When I say "obnoxious" I mean "loud".  If they were to be destructive with the merchandise, they would be buying said merchandise with their own money.|`|rThIVk2maa	Meh, they just have been misinformed that their children will be stifled if they don't let them do whatever they want. Kids are quite creative, they know this, and walk all over the wimpy adults who let them get away with stuff.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Look at my name!...Do you think I agree with you?<br>  It's almost to the point where I don't like to go out in public any more. At restaurants I ask to be seated in the "No Shrieking" section. Parents, especially young parents, learn to block out the sound of their obnoxious brats at home, because it's easier than dealing with them. The problem comes when they take the little varmints out in public and the ankle-biters act the same way as at home!  Parents don't understand that that behavior is not appreciated by others, and it's not cute any more.<br>  Children, particularly ill-mannered ones, are NOT universally loved.
NFY4A1csaa	The "Rat" was a popular hair styling item in the 40's.  Most of the intricate hair styles seen in the movies then, a la Betty Grable, Alice Faye, etc. made use of the rat to form a pompadour.

The rat tail comb was good for lifting it higher !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!____________|`|b3h0ovgRaa	I have never heard of the Rat. I hated teasing my hair way back when but that was the style. Today I could not-would not tease my hair again. Enough is enough.   Poppy|`|AA12038658	What are you talking about? I had my hair teased up (AKA Sarah Palin) for my prom. And it was a hassle combing it out, but that's what we did back then.<br>  What do you mean by a 'rat'?|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	My Mother wore a rat but I never have.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Back in the day, when "big hair" was in, along with the 'bubble' style,<br>  I back combed like everyone else I knew. There was never a mention<br>  of a "rat" to lift the hair, that I heard or read about in teen magazines.<br>  We did use rat tailed combs that we'd use to lift our hair at the crown<br>  and top. And we slept on bigger curlers to get the added bump on<br>  top. Looking back, I'm sure the teen aged girls in the movies or on TV<br>  must have worn them. As some really had a large hump at the crown<br>  and on top. Especially in those 'beach blanket' movies.<br>      Big hair was a pain to keep up. And back combing led to split ends<br>  and damaged hair. I didn't keep it too long, and had my hair cut short.<br>  That put a stop to damaged hair for me. And I've mainly worn it short<br>  since then.|`|5d93feba60a6599e3f77941fe4be59d6aa	I have never used the rat. I only had my hair teased once for Prom and my Dads had to comb it out. It was horrible. They sprayed  that lacquer on you teased hair then and it took hours to comb out. I have never had it teased since. No hairspray either.|`|XzLUA7ataa	I had a roller like you describe to pull my hair back into a "bun" which basically shaped the hair from a pony tail and spread it over the mesh.<br>  I never knew it was called a "rat".|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I think I did it once, it wasn't worth the trouble getting the rats out. My sister and cousin did it every day, they each used a whole can of hair spray a week.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I used one a few times however I could never get mine to stay where I wanted it.  In an hour or so it was off on the side of my head and looked silly. I finally gave up using it.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	To be honest I never heard of the Rat I did the blood & tears teasing lol my hair was so high &   a hurricane couldn't move it lol  &  tons of hair spray|`|O9FojdEMaa	i'm not a lady but my paternal grandmother wore a rat in her hair.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	I remember my mother had 'rats'
1sOWpQR2aa	It sounds like it by the way it played out but you may not know all the factors. The times have shown us that this kind of thing typically happens but its very wrong. I seriously hope this was not the case.|`|HMFR1I01aa	obviously|`|A7GV3lYkaa	not its not racist.<br>  Black people tend to steal high valuable things to sell them later<br>  <br>  its not racist, hey, so you dint finish the story.... what did you end up doing with that high valueable thing??  did you sell it? or do you still have it with you?|`|n8nGuu70aa	they could have just been really suspicious that u did it- maybe some1 saw something or maybe theres a rumor going around.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	It sounds possible it could be racially motivated.  It is also possible that someone reported you as in possession of the item either because they saw you with it, or because they wanted to divert attention from themselves.  If you did not take the item, then you should be able to feel vindicated that the accusation was shown to be false.<br>  <br>  You may also want to consider working somewhere else since guilt by race seems to be the standard position of your employer.  I also recommend checking with a lawyer about the possibility of a lawsuit.<br>  <br>  If you did take the item, and someone else witnessed you taking it, then it might not be racism.  Only you know the truth behind that answer.  However, if that is the case, racist behavior does not justify committing theft.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|ktbRE826aa	if they don't have a specific reason for doing that, such as someone said to them i saw him take it!..suspicion, then yes|`|eS9nPWqBaa	LOL what?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry i didn't mean to laugh....but if they did that at my job...the war would be on.<br>  <br>  Did they have more evidence against you?  I mean I don't want to make assumptions here....|`|EYqTV2EYaa	If you know for sure they did the search because you were Black, then yes.|`|AA11828121	Yes it is and you should file a report.|`|MmfMJq9Paa	I don't think that is racism, there is a reason why you were singled out, That you did not mention to us..  If you want to scream racism, then go for it but, The investigators did there job and you got singled out.  Did they find anything? They know their rights believe me, more then you will know and they are within their rights to search you. Good luck anyways.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Sounds racist to me|`|0dbDQh8Haa	umm yeah. that's really annoying. unless there's reasons for them to believe you did it (a coworker seeing you with it last, somebody heard a rumor about you doing it), then that is definitely racism. i'm sorry.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	did you ask why? did they have reason for investigating or other information. this is not the whole story is it?|`|BSqDYs1eaa	i think it is yes they are clearly just singling you out for your colour and it is disgusting if i were you i would be absolutley furious please report it for the good of yourself|`|AA11125475	File a report. It sounds like discrimination.|`|lz8Y1ihzaa	well if your residence was searched by cops, then the cops had probable cause.  BUT if you are the ONLY one who got your house searched (you would never know if the others got their houses searched or not.  That would be kept confidential.)  So i think you are highly exaggerating that the others that work with you did not have their residences searched, unless you asked them point blank, and they told you.  I doubt they would tell you, because that would throw off the investigation, i am sure the police told the others NOT to tell anyone anything about it.  You have NO proof that the others didn't get their houses searched.  What, did you follow them to their house, stay with them everyday, and cops didn't show up to search?  C'mon, tell a better fish story than this!|`|zih6UH0laa	yea probably.<br>  people are ***** like that cause they assume black people r big theifs and crap|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	I dont think "racism" is the correct teminology, but that is not what is important right now.<br>  <br>  I will bet my boots that something was said during the interviews that made them search your stuff...Right or wrong, that is prolly the reason it happened..<br>  <br>  Was the item found?<br>  <br>  It's racism if the ~only~ reason they searched your stuff is because of your black skin color.  NO other reason, whatsoever...<br>  <br>  I dont think you ought to file a complaint.  You will just make "them" PO'ed.  "They" will say that something came out in the interview that made them search your stuff...|`|BROOfRQZaa	hmm, maybe how do you know they didn't search everyone else car...|`|JITTMjasaa	Yes, and they have no right to search you place of residence. That's a violation of privacy. You should have told them to F**K OFF!! Unfortunately because you did agree to let them search your place you can't include it in your lawsuit (if you choose to, and I hope you do). I hope you sue them for everything they have. Good luck.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	It's probably racial profiling. If the police were the ones conducting the search, they had to have a warrant. If they obtained a warrant, that means a judge signed off on it, citing probable cause (most likely). All of this is documented and if the research on the part of the police officer doesn't support the warrant, then you have the right to some legal action.|`|QKVheuAXaa	YES!!!! you should file a report on them!!!|`|4QHanq1Laa	or you are over reacting... Im not racist at all by no means, but i work for the WCB in canada and I get complaints daily about racism, wether it be based on religion, color, of skin, sex.<br>  <br>  The majority of the time it's just someone making a big deal out of nothing.|`|XbZIicftaa	Don't they need a warrant for that?|`|0AeLcoe7aa	fuq yeah|`|Uac9AXmDaa	yes|`|ek1193Qiaa	i do think so|`|AA11961672	Sure sounds like it to me...unless you were the only person that had access to that stolen item. <br>  and how could they have searched your home? that is not legal.|`|UMYda9Jaaa	It definitely sounds like racism unless they had extra reason to suspect you, like for example you were the only one around at the time they think the object was stolen.|`|CyDVisE7aa	Yes but you cannot prove it unless they said something  about your race now a days they call this a common case of racially profiling.<br>  <br>  and **** you scott I am half black do I steal items worth half value go to hell you jerkoff|`|iiRbOAQnaa	Yes, unless someone said you did it or there was some sort of evidence against you.|`|4Ka4Mqo5aa	You need to differentiate between racism and colour prejudice.  The Jews were victims of racism but primarily the same skin colour as the perpetrators of the Holocaust.  Are you therefore more correct in suggesting that you were a victim of colour prejudice and discrimination?  However, on the basis of the information you have given I do not think anybody could say whether you were or were not a victim of racism/colour discrimination because it all depends on the fact of whether or not the investigators had good evidence to search your home and car and not others....this information you have not provided.|`|UiOAnm89aa	It totally depends.<br>  Others may have been searched and you haven't heard or seen it or they may have had evidence which pointed towards you or your name may have been brought up by someone who thought they saw you do it?<br>  This sounds pretty phoney too because you can only have your car/residence searched if they have a police officer get a licence to do it - your employer can't just search your property like that!|`|PEMnzRnvaa	if you took it then no, if you didn't then maybe|`|5UbyeVySaa	I don't like accusing people of their actions that I think are wrong without considering the benefit of the doubt first (in that case, I would maybe assume that the owner of the stolen item or whatever it was just thought you were a little more suspicious than the other workers). However, this particular case is a little ridiculous. I'm pretty sure you were searched because you were black. That is racism, and you should file a complaint. Where do you live? (Just the general area, you don't have to give your address, Ha Ha).|`|hkn0az4xaa	it sounds a bit weird...it could be.|`|LHnVjJqsaa	well sometimes they keep searches and stuff priavte and dont tell who they search so maybe people think that you were the only one searched...however...if in fact you were the only one searched then yes it may have been racism...maybe they got footage and the person looked like you??  i dont know but whatev the situation may be just file a report...it couldnt do you any harm|`|xF6aTbDVaa	yeah.. I think so...|`|OvQKd508aa	Yes.  If you were singled out and you were the only black employee that day, you have definite grounds for a complaint of racism.  Talk to human resources at your company, then your local police department, and if that doesn't work, contact a lawyer.|`|CLFwZ3MBaa	yup 100 percent but u got to have proof, get something solid or testimony, cell phones have recorders, ask 2 to 3 co worker if their vehicle was search, record it. then file a complain..this way you cover with proof.|`|AA10051614	its profiling. and contact the HR dept to report that issue.|`|9tEdqXHjaa	yes that is and it is wrong you should report it immediately  you can get a lot of money for reporting that goes against a couple federal laws|`|DedSicGvaa	Yes it is and you should file a report but since the police can be fired for being racist they will probably make up a story that they had reason to believe that you stole the item.|`|vMSm9M4saa	Kinda... i mean if it is because of your skin tone.. thats stupid.. i dont understand why people are racist|`|HtAXbr2Taa	Yes, you should tell your manager or supervisor. That is terrible to be discriminated based on the colour of your skin.|`|vanUYJjjaa	YES!  Why? because there was an obvious difference in treatment.<br>  Report it to HR. If you get no recourse from HR, get a lawyer.|`|hmjAwZQEaa	i would class it as racial discrimination and i would challenge it. legally if necessary|`|zxXzJH09aa	Sounds like racism... but did you do anything that might have been suspicious? If not its racism|`|Xc20Nz3oaa	that is racism. They should've searched everyone and they just chose you. That's straight up wrong man. File a report.
URO3gDXcaa	it is a disbelief.  the proof is on the believer for proof.|`|tuULGJS6aa	Holy books prove that gods in them can't exist in any way. The Bible proves that God-Yahweh-etc. is imaginary. The Quran proves Allah isn't real...and so it goes. Sacred texts are so full of contradictions and ignorance that the ones who wrote them were very ignorant men, not wise gods. Studying the holy books of all religions shows they're all created by ignorant men. There's no proof that any gods are real either, and the burden of proof is with the believer. Nothing is ever absolutely proved in science, but many things are so improbable that only gullible people believe them. Nobody can prove or disprove the idea that there are purple unicorns on pluto, but this idea is so improbable that nobody wastes time trying to prove it or disprove it. The same can be said for any god you choose to name. Going along with the best evidence is not a belief. A belief is accepting something without any evidence. You're playing semantic games here by creating an apparent situation with words that isn't any more real than any gods men have created.|`|WseLyvSpaa	Any claim or statement made in earnest by a person is a belief by necessity.  That has no bearing on whether it is true or not.  Truth claims should be evaluated based on evidence. Without any reasoning, we call a belief faith.  Belief without evidence.<br>  <br>  God's existence could certainly be proved...if he existed!    But nothing can be logically disproved.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	As much so as not holding a positive belief in other things like leprechauns, fairies, magical dragons, psychic cats that live on other planets, etc...that lack good evidence. So if you consider disbelief in leprechauns a belief then its the same kind as that.<br>  <br>  There is actually pretty significant evidence around for black holes and atoms.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	Saying "god X does not exist" IS a belief.<br>  <br>  However since most atheists (except the minority of strong atheists) simply say "I don't believe your claims that god X does exist"  then that's not a belief, but applied skepticism refusing to accept an unsupported claim|`|LpyEAcjeaa	Yes, it is just a belief.<br>  <br>  However, it is a justified belief.|`|756012ab0251e75276bfcdb01caf9285aa	I’d have to agree with you on this one, that’s why I am an agnostic atheist. Even though I don’t know, I believe in it highly improbable that there is a god.|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	I agree ... there's no concrete proof either way ... I do find more evidence against god than for god though.|`|ntyClwciaa	Because they do not ask the question of who created them, they are too arrogant to live in the world knowing that everything they do is from their own doing, and too childish to think that if their prayer doesn't get answered then there is no God. For them God is only for answered prayer, if God didn't let them get what they want then that prove them that there is no God.|`|htQrkD8waa	no its not-<br>  <br>  its theists that want to put the two on equal footing.<br>  <br>  they have no proof so it is not "god exists or doesn't" its- <br>  <br>  there is no proof to substantiate the existance of god.<br>  <br>  <br>  to put the two as equals (and thus claim that saying god doesn't exist is a "belief") creates a logical fallacy where in order to discredit something it must be disproven.<br>  <br>  otherwise the idea of superman existing, of harry potter existing, of pokemon existing, of minotaurs, pink unicorns, and monchichis existing are all equal with the "nay sayers" even though there is no proof to support this.<br>  <br>  <br>  so it is more than a belief- it is the necessary and logical default position.<br>  <br>  if a theist wants to claim his position is more than just a mere belief, he must provide credible evidence of gods existance and it must pass scientific muster.<br>  <br>  so they are not on equal footing. its not a case of yes or no, its a case of the burden of proof.  anyone making a claim for the existance of anything be it superman, hobbits or god, must make a submission of proof and testing.<br>  <br>  in short- the idea of god must be first put into testable hypothesis form, then tested, if the testing shows that god exists, then it will eventually become theory.<br>  <br>  <br>  thus far- no theist has ever been able to do this, therefore god does not exist.|`|IDZTtipeaa	Replace "God" with anything you can possibly think of.  Anything.<br>  <br>  You will find that skepticism and lack of acceptance for a claim with no evidence requires ZERO belief.  You get to make a choice.  You can choose to accept that which can be demonstrated (there are a variety of ways to demonstrate something), or you can choose to not accept.  Not accepting the supernatural is not a belief.  Accepting the supernatural, by definition, is belief.  That is all that is required.<br>  <br>  Edit:  You think seeing something is the only way to provide evidence.  This is absolutely incorrect.  Your comment about there being little or no evidence for the existence of atoms shows an amazing level of ignorance.  Perhaps you'd be wiser to rephrase and say you don't know of the evidence for atoms.<br>  Your definition of evidence is used quite a bit by Holocaust deniers.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	Until something is proven to exist, there is zero reason to believe it does.<br>  <br>  <br>  "but there is really no evidence to prove that black holes,the space time continum,or atoms exist "<br>  <br>  Sorry, didn't realize you are stupid.  I won't make the mistake of answering any more of your questions.<br>  <br>  Atoms don't exist, you sir are a genius.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://education.jlab.org/atomtour/" rel="nofollow">http://education.jlab.org/atomtour/</a>|`|jAPBNtMKaa	I don't say he doesn't exist. I simply don't believe.<br>  <br>  Got it?<br>  <br>  Um we have seen atoms and we have seen (indirectly) black holes. And the curvature of space has been observed. So everything you added is moot.|`|5rP0zBudaa	You can still give something a probability. We can be over 99% sure that God does not exist. Just as you can be over 99% sure the tooth fairy does not exist. It doesn't really take any faith.|`|yj5YeCvaaa	Atheists do not believe God exists. Christians, claim to KNOW that he exists, but they really just BELIEVE he does. Its all about beliefs.|`|idmgvLfRaa	I've never said any deities don't exist.  I don't believe they do.|`|HmyabzC8aa	Yes, a belief backed up by much evidence.|`|BVVvb8Ieaa	Actually it would be disbelief.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unless you say it is a belief you hold that the smurfs are not real|`|cC8TamjSaa	Yes that is correct atheists do not believe there is a God. Thank you for enlightening us.|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	Not this question again...<br>  <br>  This question comes up every day.<br>  <br>  Please get with the program.<br>  <br>  The answer is NO.|`|AA11297267	No, not quite.<br>  As there is no evidence for any god of any kind, the only possible rational conclusion one can reach from the evidence is that there is no god.<br>  While you're correct that the non-existence of god can't be proven, without any affirmative evidence to show there's such a thing it's not possible to conclude that there is one.  That's not a "belief," it's simply the only logical conclusion possible.<br>  <br>  And without evidence to show one exists, to assume that one does is *entirely* "belief."  Absence of belief is not the same as belief.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|inMO8g0vaa	Seriously, it needn't be proved until something tangible occurs to make us hypothesize that he exists.<br>  <br>  Humankind is consistently attempting to find causes of all things, because it makes life better.  In the past many folks were quite happy to accept the "god did it" theory, which allowed things like the plague and natural disaster kill countless people due to our ignorance about the root cause.  <br>  <br>  Now that we have generally gotten over the 'God Did it' fad, our lives are much better.  We live longer, eat better, kill each other less, and even have systems of Government that reward the individual instead of only the leaders.<br>  <br>  God's incredible inaction, denotes non existence, just like leprechauns incredible inaction denotes non existence and Ghosts incredible inaction denotes non existense.<br>  <br>  Until believers can rustle up some credible evidense then we have no option but to categorize him with all other myth, its really that simple.|`|AA11282654	No. Because, you see, I believe that contradictions do not exist. They expose lies. And when you take away all the contradictions to the theory of God, there is very little left at all. Such as the trinity. Three being one. Such as God being without beginning. Such as God being all good and everywhere while evil runs rampant.|`|zkETPA8waa	As much as saying that dragon-slaying leprechaun rap musicians don't exist. Doesn't exactly require a lot of faith.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	And that is why I am an agnostic atheist. I don't believe, but I also don't know for sure.
zRPXczxAaa	No, there is no way you can broach this subject with the boys.  As your husband is apparently saying, his sons' indifference to the presents you've sent them is sufficient indication that they don't want them.  So stop sending them.  As you note, these boys are way too old to be so rude; and that also means they are way too old to be reprimanded for their bad manners--or rather for their lack of good manners.  In general, remember:  Adults should never presume to punish or reprimand adults--but adults can and do sometimes, with devastating effectiveness, pointedly ignore adults.|`|P9wMY4Zpaa	hmm it really doesnt bother me when they don't say thank you. after all, i give my loved ones gifts just so they can have it, not so i can get gratitude. but if you dont want to send anymore, then dont.|`|w4kdTalPaa	Evidently they did not learn to say thank you when they were younger<br>  Getting them to change now might be rather difficult. All you can do is discuss the problem with them.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	At 20 and 17, they're pretty self aware.  They don't say thank you because they aren't grateful.  If they were...they would. Even the daughter...who acknowledges the gifts...only jots off a 'quick' thank you through MySpace?   I don't know the family dynamics here, but I suspect there are some 'issues' between your husband and his children.  You can broach this subject with them if you want to...but be prepared to hear things you may not want to in response.  You'd probably be better off just not sending them anything...I don't think it would matter to them either way....I'm just sayin...<br>  <br>  Case in point:  "Life goes on" basically admitted that she only says thank you in order to keep the gifts coming...that's probably what your husband's daughter is doing.  At least the boys are being true to their own feelings.|`|aTHw2Bywaa	The boys on the receiving end are not being thankful, but are you just sending gifts and money to be thanked?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should jokingly say "your welcome" (with a nice smile).<br>  Or maybe you can just ask them if they received whatever it is you sent them and also ask if they liked it.<br>  <br>  All in all, the boys won't appreciate it, if you're giving presents only to be thanked.|`|929b0210e46cbd96484f7032e99a63afaa	Send them a message, or better yet speak to them, and say, "I wanted to make sure you received the __________ we sent you. We never heard from you about it and we were afraid it got lost in the mail or something!" It will wake them up to the fact that not acknowledging gifts is rude, while being gentle about it. If after that the behaviour continues, take a bolder approach and have your husband speak to them about it. (He should be the one to do it, as they are his children, not yours!)<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Holly :)|`|TXddP0uxaa	Try not to be confrontational.  The best way to help young people amend a bad habit is by giving them honest advice without sounding like you are blaming them.  It is possible that they honestly don't know they are supposed to send thank you cards when they receive gifts.  Just tell them straight out, "Now that you are an adult, the custom is to send a card when you get a gift.  Some people will think you are ungrateful if you don't."  You could even get them a stationary set as a gift!|`|3becff333a551f4097226dfe2aae0006aa	It's your husband's job to teach his children manners.  He should tell the boys what he expects from them.  No one is too old to learn.  Cutting them off should be a last resort.<br>  <br>  (The 20-year-old is just barely an adult, and the 17-year-old isn't one, so his father certainly does have the right to correct them.)|`|1fd9957e2ec9a7bf90a8eb7c7c9d3c47aa	Stop giving. They are old enough to have learned some manners. Talking to them about their rudeness may or may not help them realize what is expected when they receive a gift from you. If it doesn't, save your generosity for the well-mannered girl.|`|44h8skM6aa	I have grandparents (sorta-actually step gradparents, but w/e) who think like your husband. If you go two occasions in a row without sending them a thank-you card. Don't expect anything for your birthday. They are very generous, I've only known them 3 yrs, but for all of thier grand-children (including me and my brothers even though we're still not technically family) get a box a chocolates and $100 for christmas. This year for my 16th birthday I got $50. But no thank you note-no money for you. I have seen them do this to other relatives, so I always make sure to write a nice thank you for them. <br>  <br>  So, basically, I agree with your husband, send them to the daughter and not the sons. Maybe also give a note to the daughter saying how much you appreciate her thank you notes. Maybe if you emphasize that only she sends them, she'd pass the message on to the sons.|`|vBcZZRx5aa	I am 22 and I have a dad that lives far away also.  He will occasionally send me a check and of course I will cash it.  His family will send me things too.  I don't know your relationships to the kids, but if your husband only sees them once or twice a year, it is a clear way for the boys to say they are upset. I know I will never say thank you for the things that my biological father sends because it doesn't mean anything to me, and if he stopped I wouldn't care.  I have no close attachment to him either.  This man is basically a stranger to me and the gifts he sends doesn't replace the time I've lost.  Plus, if you ask them to respond graciously you are going to add fuel to the fire.  I think it can be rude to ask people to say thank you, and they will not be happy about it.  If it bothers you that they don't say thank you then stop sending them things, and then you both can be content.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	Carry on sending gifts to the girl as she does say thank you.  As for the boys, I wouldn't anymore.  If they ask, say that because they never bothered to say thanks for the gifts, you decided not to bother buying them anything.<br>  <br>  If you say something to them now, you'll get a half felt thank you from them for the first year then they won't bother.  Stoppoing now will get them to remember from now on.  <br>  <br>  If they start saying that it's not fair that their sister got gifts, all you need to say is that it is fair, she bothers to say thanks and you bother to buy her gifts but they don't bother, therefore you don't bother and it's about time that they grow up and start acting their age.|`|yFKQFeeJaa	keep sending things to the girl who apreciates it and not the other two. that should get the message across|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Ever hear of not rewarding bad behavior? don't send them ANYTHING, and you'll hear from them quick enough!|`|VMY7No0eaa	i WOULD only send to the girl.<br>  I liked what the girl who's parents live far away said...<br>  <br>  or just start sending it only to the girl... when they protest... just say what you said here...<br>  POSSIBLY they MIGHT say thanks but I doubt it.<br>  good luck<br>  P.S. are YOU the one who sends out thank you notes in your house... doe s your husband do it?

dB2BRGRAaa	The vast majority of people in the UK support the Queen and monarchy.<br>  <br>  In an Ipsos/Mori poll in 2006 (see source) 72% of people polled supported Britain remaining a monarchy compared with 18% wanting a republic (10% were undecided).  85% of those polled were satisfied with the Queen's role as monarch.<br>  <br>  The poll was done for The Sun newspaper which is a right of centre daily tabloid, however, Ipsos/Mori is a reputable polling company and the questions are unbiased.<br>  <br>  You will find that there are some very opinionated people on this subject but I think that the above poll is fairly reflective of people's views.|`|qpCUvqq8aa	There are still Jacobites, for ****** sake, so royalty is going no where|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	The Queen supports no political party so generally has a larger level of support when compared to other world leaders.<br>  <br>  I believe that she averages around an 80% approval rating.|`|KRTPJP2baa	Monarchy should end with this Queen.

kTZevQNHaa	You will find it beneficial to listen to French radio and watch French television and movies as well as to spend time with French people...to listen -focus-hear-and practice. <br>  (Listening and hearing are different things--focusing on the receiving/interpretation  of the correct sound)<br>  <br>  It will come to you eventually. Don't give up.<br>  Part of the problem might be you're maybe  self-consciousness about how you think you sound (maybe you think you sound 'weird' when you speak like this--because the sounds you're required to make are seeming so foreign to that what you are accustomed to)...and in fact that is what the problem might be...Seems like the sounds of the French language are just seeming too foreign to you so you need to familiarize yourself with the sound and pronunciation of the words in this language. But the thing is you have all the necessary vocal chords and mouth parts to make those sounds.,..you just need to learn how--like how one learns to sing a song...It's not really 'nasally" as you say but more words formed using the roof of your mouth in conjunction with your tongue to pronounce vin and un and on...perhaps you are not hearing it correctly...as one who is tone deaf may not hear the proper note....practice and lear how then to repeat the sound. You may not be used to using your mouth and tongue et.c in those ways to make those particular sounds just now  but-- with practice, you will do very well I believe.<br>  <br>  You may well speak with your own native accent while speaking french but that doesn't mean there's need to speak incorrectly. Just as actors can lose an accent and don another one for a part, I believe that you too shall--with practice listening and speaking French,,,shall be able to do much better than you think you are doing now.<br>  Try using a tape recorder...record that what is said by you and then the way it sounds when a Francophone says it...and compare and keep track of your progress. Sometimes, we hear ourselves with more clarity when listening to our own voices tape recorded.<br>  Bonne change!|`|m4nKkFDUaa	If you're learning with a teacher, ask them to go over it with you, I'm sure they'd be happy to help, and if you're learning alone, try to source some kind of cd to listen to and practice with etc., or even better, if you know a French speaker they might be able to help. They're difficult to pronounce, but I'm certain they can be mastered with practice!

NGz7R9enaa	Our country was built on the idea that ALL men are created equal. It was born by those suffering through religious prosecution. There is such a thing as the separation of church and state that the fathers of our country put in place. You can't blame the Atheists for our country's ways, you can blame the American people of the last century.|`|lCzBONU1aa	Oh I guess, if they must.  But they might need to pass a literacy test first.

If I do something I'm told not to, I'll get punished, so I'm not going to do that unless I think I can get away with it."  THAT is the morality of a toddler, a pet, or a "god-fearing," non-Christian hating, Bible-belt nut.<br>  <br>  When someone gets to young adulthood, they (usually) progress to a type of morality that involves "I'm going to do what's best for the world around me because I care about other people, and I'll do it even if I get punished for it because I want to do the right thing and help people."  Since an Atheist isn't afraid of hell or divine punishment, this is the level THEY are at.<br>  <br>  In short, someone like you has the morality of a toddler, and the vast majority of Atheists and non-hell believers have the morality of a fully-grown human being.<br>  <br>  I don't trust people to vote who believe in a book that teaches that disobedient children are to be stoned, gay people have no rights, slavery is good, and that inter-faith marriages should be illegal.<br>  <br>  I'm non-Christian and I follow the rule "Harm none."  This is a very short sampling of the book YOU rely on for morality (taken at random from the book of Numbers):<br>  <br>  # God shows his hospitality with the admonition: "The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." 1:51, 3:10, 3:38<br>  <br>  # Two of Aaron's sons are killed by God for "offering strange fire before the Lord." 3:4<br>  <br>  # Don't touch or "go in to see when the holy things are covered." God kills people who touch or look at covered holy things. 4:15, 20<br>  <br>  # God tells the people to expel from camp "every leper, every one that hath an issue, and whoever is defiled by the dead." So by God's instructions, the sick are abandoned and left to suffer and die alone. 5:1-4<br>  <br>  # "And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it." (He had his hearing aid on.) He then burned the complainers alive. That'll teach them. 11:1<br>  <br>  # "And wile the flesh [of the quails] was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague. "The Bible isn't too clear about what these poor folks did to upset God so much; all it says is that they had "lusted." 11:33<br>  <br>  # Miriam and Aaron (Moses' brother and sister) criticize Moses for marrying an Ethiopian woman and thus breaking the law of God. But God makes it clear that his rules don't apply to his favorites, and he strikes Miriam with leprosy. Notice that only Miriam is punished, though both she and Aaron complained. 12:1, 9-10<br>  <br>  # More plagues and pestilence sent by God. God repeats one of his favorite promises: "your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness." 14:12, 29, 14:32-37<br>  <br>  # God punishes the children for the failings of their great-great grandfathers. 14:18<br>  <br>  ****  Given the book that you follow, I don't want YOU running our country.

There is some disorder now even among religious people, and despite laws, but the most successful people will be those who have most order among themselves - it's a survival factor, and is not dependent on belief in a deity.<br>  <br>  The basic "moral" behaviour of doing favours is something that developed over millions of years of natural selection. We are "programmed" to repay favours with favours in return. Those whose behaviour is faulty in this regard get less favours from others. This is the so-called golden rule, discovered by Greek philosophers and included in the sermon on the mount. Other species display this behaviour too.<br>  <br>  As our way of life became more complex, we've had to adapt rules and laws to facilitate our more complicated way of life. There are differences from culture to culture, and from time to time. <br>  <br>  In ancient times, a vengeful God would have been invoked as the source and guardian of these "laws", frightening most people into obeying them and into stoning those who didn't. It would have been considered better to kill wayward individuals than risk divine retribution on the community. This reason, perhaps watered down, is what many religious people believe make people good; but the real reason is more biological, and belief in a deity is not needed for good behaviour.|`|Znw52fxkaa	No idea of good/evil, right/wrong?<br>  <br>  I think you're mistaking the meaning of atheism, an absense of religion does not mean an absense of values/morals.<br>  <br>  Should disabled people be unable to vote because they can't walk/talk/hear the same as everyone else? Should elderly people be able to vote because their memory is shot? Should women be stopped from voting because they're not men?<br>  <br>  The world used to be based on prejudices which were silly...if you descriminate now against one, it doesn't end.|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	First of all that is discrimination and directly infringing peoples rights. Discrimination is a violation of human rights, according to Amnesty International.<br>  <br>  You seem to be making a lot of wild assumptions. On what basis are you making the judgment that atheists don't have a concept of what is good and evil. We; unlike many religious people; think for ourselves to decide what is right and what is wrong. We don't need a bible consistently dictate to how we should or should not live our lives. We do not commit murder, we do not steal, we do not cheat and we do not discriminate. Why don't we do these things? Because of our non-religious upbringing, because of our life experiences, because of the type of people truly are, because we have the capacity to think for our selves (we don't need a handbook to tell us all this)<br>  <br>  The whole argument of what is truly moral is a matter of opinion. One might argue that the christian teachings are far from moral at all. A lot of your extremists promote discrimination and hatred towards members of other religions, atheists and the GBLT community. I find that immoral. I also find it immoral when certain extremist christians justify the death of homosexuals just because YOUR belief system is against it.<br>  <br>  Furthermore any legalized state should never be run on the ideals of the religious. For the simple reason that it infringes the rights of others on a far too often basis; whether it be alternative beliefs, GBLT community or atheists. <br>  <br>  Human beings have the right to equality, perhaps this is an aspect some of the religious people do not comprehend. Atheist have been discriminated for far too long; enough is enough. You should take a long good hard look at yourselves before you judge us, other than that your just an ignorant hypocrite.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	I think one of the most irritating things about christians is the way they try to claim that the morality comes from a religion. Morality is a human trait it is important in any human population if it is to work so all groups or populations have some sort of morality. if you examine the history of the Christian religion you will find that it's morals have never been particularly good.<br>  Let us remember that Hitler was a practising catholic|`|psMZrXa7aa	Ahh... yet another ignorant idiot.<br>  Just because someone is an atheist it does not mean they do not know good from evil or right from wrong. It means that they do not believe in religion.<br>  For instance, i know that to help someone in their time of need is a good thing. I also know that to kill for no reason without remorse is evil. <br>  I know that to start my answer by calling you an 'ignorant idiot' is wrong. I also know that if i were to apologise for calling you names that would be the right thing to do.<br>  Why do you think that somebody that does not believe in any religion does not deserve to have a say in how your country is run?<br>  Does that mean that you believe that anyone who is not a christian is not worthy of having a say? <br>  It's no wonder that there is so much evil and wrong doing on the planet if that is the way that religious people are taught to think. <br>  I'm an atheist and proud of it! As such my motto is to live and let live.<br>  <br>  p.s. i apologise for calling you an 'Ignorant idiot'.|`|yNNdHDKvaa	An "atheist" is just someone who hasn't come to know Jesus yet.<br>  We were all atheist at one point in time of our lives.<br>  The undecided have just as much right to make decisions in this world as Christians do.<br>  Some undecided don't come to the Lord until late in their lives.<br>  It is not that they do not know the difference between good and evil, it is just that they have not decided to refrain from their evil sin nature just yet.<br>  Remember, Christians are not to be judgmental.We are to let God decide who comes to him and who doesn't.God knew us and what we were going to do in life before we were even conceived!<br>  <br>       God Bless Us,...Everyone!|`|AA12193600	When you get old enough to vote, maybe you will change your mind--who will you exclude next you yellow bellied bigot--moslems--then who--hindus=--perhaps buddists after that.

That is what makes us a Great Nation, and that is what makes us stronger each day.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if liberals control the government it is only for 4 years.

I mean, come on...seriously? <br>  If I say I don't believe in Santa Claus does that make me a bad person?<br>  <br>  Atheists might not believe in god, but they still have morals and they know the difference between right and wrong. It is basic human nature -scratch that- it is basic animal nature. Every animal society has a mutual support/ mutual aid system. This means that they help each other out, stick together, support each other, etc. This is the only way for societies to survive. Animals do not have a sense of god, but they still follow this mutual aid system. They know the difference between right and wrong. Animals of the same species do not normally kill each other because their survival depends on the support and compassion towards each other. <br>  <br>  We are all humans, whether we believe in god or not. Everyone has a conscience and we all know right from wrong. It's what we do with that knowledge that counts. <br>  <br>  And not everyone in your country is Christian, so it would be extremely arrogant for you to demand that everyone follow your definition of values. There are some Christian values that are not necessarily "good" ones.|`|c554f73c9fd5ac5496d354c900893bd9aa	Atheists should absolutely be allowed to vote.  Christian values are retarding this nation's development.  You don't have to look far to see what a born-again christian president just did to our country in 8 years.  A "holy war" that god told him to under take has us mired in the Middle East and his cronyism has allowed the wealthy and greedy to operate with no supervision or accountability to the detriment of every hard working American who struggles to get by.  It's time religion's phased out of this country.  It's a backwards way of thinking that's relevance and purpose has expired.  And if you think that atheists have idea of good or evil, right and wrong, your understanding of atheism is sorely uninformed.  Just because I don't claim to get derive my morals from a 2000 year old book wrought with inconsistencies, implausible miracles and brutality, doesn't mean I don't have morals.|`|YNYpmhy6aa	It's very unfair to suggest that atheists don't have a sense of right or wrong. I'm sure that the vast majority of atheists don't condone murder, rape or theft. You don't need to be a Christian or follow a specific religious code to have moral values.<br>  <br>  In fact, most atheists would agree that obeying the 10 commandments is a good, moral way to live their lives - they just don't believe the bit about Jesus.<br>  <br>  <br>  And anyway, everyone has a right to vote. Surely it is a Christian value that everyone is equal? Even non-Christians. It says so in the American Constitution anyway, somehting which you rightly pointed out is based on Christian values.<br>  <br>  So basically what you're saying (atheists shouldn't be allowed to vote) actually contradicts your own religious values.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I believe in God myself - I just think that people like you put people off Christianity and are very hypocritical. You'll probably respond to this answer in a self-righteous huff, but I wouldn't expect anything else.|`|sfkD5hR2aa	Yes, of course they should be ALLOWED to vote. Who said that they don't know the difference between right and wrong?<br>  <br>  Although, I do understand what you mean when you say people who do not know the difference between right and wrong should not vote. I mean, how can someone who does not use spelling and grammar correctly, vote correctly? You obviously do not know the difference between 'right and wrong' when it comes to topics such as grammar, so does that mean you should not be allowed to vote?<br>  <br>  Are you truly concerned about your country or are you just against Atheists?<br>  <br>  P.S.: I am in no way saying my spelling and grammar is used correctly. If I have made any mistakes, I apologise. :)|`|AA11578666	i totally understand where ur coming from, its hard to not think about<br>  but remember, when Adam and Eve ate tht apple, they knew the difference between good and evil, and from them, passed it to ALL of us (hence; original sin, but thts a whole differen story lol)<br>  including atheist. so although they may not believe in God, they still know the differnece between good and evil, but maybe only a small part of it (most know tht killing someone is bad right?)<br>  <br>  the best thing we can do it is to try to spead the Good Word, and thts wat we all need 2 do :)<br>  <br>  good luck, & God Bless :)<br>  <br>  ?peace&love?|`|V610w8EXaa	YOU should not be allowed to vote, with your defective mind on display.<br>  <br>  I have a perfect idea of good and evil, right and wrong ...

I for one don't need to be told what is right or wrong, I like to think that my own intelligence and conscious (sp?) will be enough. Nor do I need to be guilt tripped or scared into doing the right thing, I'm just a good person, without all of the religious stuff, but that's pretty unimaginable to you, isn't it? For with you, your whole life is lead by religion, you live by it, you survive because of it and you hang your whole existence off of it. Risky, eh? <br>  <br>  Because, it may not be true, in fact there is no evidence, nothing. Just 'faith', which may sound noble, but really, it's just fear. Fear of what if, or maybe a need to have a reason, an answer. <br>  <br>  I'd rather have no answer than devote my whole life to something that is most likely not true. Why believe something that was created solely  by man, and how can you be so sure that these men were prophets, spoke to by God? Yes it's written in the book, but with all the mystical and amazing miracles that one man managed to make happen in the book, yet we struggle to find a cure for cancer, and he healed the blind? Does it sound at all likely to you? At all logical?<br>  <br>  But you hang your whole existence off of it? <br>  <br>  now, I'm not here to dictate what you should or shouldn't believe, if religion helps you- so be it. <br>  <br>  But what you mustn't do, is dictate what other people should and shouldn't be allowed to do, with your only reason for doing so because they don't believe what you believe.|`|JTQ84aLKaa	They should not be permitted to vote "Aloud"<br>  <br>  Just imagine the noise?|`|6g97hxCCaa	Maybe the question should be - should people who can't spell 'allowed' be allowed to vote?!!
vEEeq7kYaa	Scary how ignorant and/or insensitive *some* of these answers are.<br>  <br>  Many fast-food places  that may offer insurance benefits for employess only do so for full time employees<br>  and a great many employers have a knack of hiring only part-time people and employ them at perhaps even a half hour a week under the designation where they would qualify for any benefits..thus not only leaving one without insurance, but one who must find TWO of these menial part time jobs just to survive.<br>  <br>  I have heard that Wal Mart no longer does this ( not sure ) but in the early 80's I was hired at Wal Mart  on a schedule that was a half hour a week under the time they were required to offer me benefits..however, I was promised by both the manager and assistant manager that " the next full-time opening that comes up, you'll get".  Not only did months go by, but they made us clock out at store closing BUT work by "zone defense" of putting things misplaced away..on our way out the door..which they determined when they'd let us out..it could be anywhere from five to fifteen minutes AFTER we had clocked out.  This added up ALWAYS to more than that half hour a week, most often to a total of 1 to 2 hours a week UNPAID work.  Six months after I was working there I mentioned that I should be getting benefits anyway since I was working more than the hours required for benefits..but they quickly told me..NOT according to the "clock"..so then I said..  I won't clock out then until they tell us zone defense is over...hmm..that would get a termination.  they held that promise out again..just hang on, you'll get full time benefits NEXT.<br>  <br>  I started speaking to co workers.and discovered just in my area of the store THREE other women who had been working there LONGER than I had who had been given the SAME PROMISE.  this was after I'd been there 9 months..then a few months later they HIRE a girl off the street for a full time position, and tell the 3 of us that we were so good at our jobs that they just had to wait until they could find someon to replace us.  Uh huh.<br>  <br>  I quit.<br>  <br>  I tell this, not just to whine about an event from more than 25 years ago..but to show that in tough times..Employers aren't going to be offering insurance benefits to part time people and they're going to be hriing new people on to work as few hours as possible.<br>  <br>   nationalized healthcare is no free ride.  All employed pay taxes and frankly, I'd rather my taxes go to help the health and well being of this country that fund many of the things that it now funds.  I think that if the costs of health care were more equitable and the cost of insurance as well..then more people would be gainfully employed and employed in a manner that they're better able to support themselves, to boot!<br>  <br>  I know that until I quit waiting on Wally World to live up to their lies to me..I qualified for public aide.  They sceduled your days off so that you could not work another job if you wanted to!  Many other employers do the same.<br>  <br>  Cobra is also out of the reach of most and sometimes insurance companies find loopholes to drop your service even if you are still paying premiums. Many people have nightmare stories about that, too.<br>  <br>  I hope you find a new job with benefits soon!<br>  <br>  In the meantime, Brigette gives great advice..<br>  <br>  Shalom|`|i3lXJbtFaa	:( I'm so sorry, (((Lappy))).

Also, your doc can give you samples until you can afford them again. just ask him to order them for you. Check out your drug manufacturer's website or google free medication or free Rx. I know that the costs of maintenance meds (that are not psychotropics) are fully covered by funds from Catholic Charities. You would need to visit your local office for an application. Also, you maybe eligible for temporary medical assistance (just for your meds) through the Department of Public welfare in your county. Many times they will help, but you will need to repay them in the future. I wish you the best!
6IXrgxqSaa	Nice question Evey. Many people seem to need more than the world we live in because they have a feeling its something missing in their lives. That something is operating beyond our perception and we can't pinpoint it. A lot of us want to know about the world we live in because if we do not, we will never be freed of the sensation of uncertainty/fear and to live in peace and confidence. <br>  <br>  This keeps us curious to understand the world we live in and to improve our state of being.This curiosity evokes questions such as What is the purpose of our lives? Is there life after death? What's the real reason behind this global crisis and suffering felt around the world? “Who am I?” ”Where am I?” “What shall become of me?” Such questions lead us to strive to know the reality in which we live. As you stated this uncertainty has let our imaginations build all sorts of pictures  (through our five senses) in our mind and sensations to help calm us down cause we haven't find anything that can give us clear truth and perception to our purpose in life. I came across some links on the perception of reality.  Take a look and hope you find the answer your seeking.

Many believe in ghosts or spirits because they have experienced things.  I am Catholic and was always taught that the dead are either in hell, purgatory or heaven. That ghosts don't exist. Yet I've experienced something 3 times that I'm sure was a ghost or something. Maybe an angel. I don't know. But I do think ghosts exists, a paranormal that is unexplainable.

In ancient times it was important to a tribe or family of people to be able to explain what happened when something went wrong - like someone getting hurt or killed.  When there was no obvious explanation - such as a boulder fell on them or they were killed by a wild animal, the unseen agent explanation then made sense.  People were able to go about their lives that way.   Today for example we know that bacteria are responsible for infection, not some "evil spirit".

AA11403032	Haven't you heard....Dinosaurs didn't exist.<br>  <br>  The earth is only 6,000 years old.  Those dinosaur fossils that are 150 million years old are just a conjuring trick performed by the devil.|`|AA11297267	The bible doesn't mention "dinosaurs."  Or anything like them.<br>  And since the christians assert (incorrectly, which has been absolutely proven) that Adam & Eve existed about 6,000 years ago, they're some 64,994,000 years too late to have been around any dinosaurs.<br>  <br>  Peace.<br>  <br>  p.s. I find it rather amusing that it's the strict bible literalists -- the ones who claim every word in the bible is true, perfect, and absolute -- are the same ones who claim "dragon" in the bible means "dinosaur" :)|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Just a few hours after, on day six, were they all created.<br>  <br>  The word 'dinosaur' wasn't invented when the Bible was first translated into English,<br>  they used the word "Dragon" etc.<br>  <br>  Job 40 for the 'behemoth' and Job 41 for the 'leviathon"<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|oL6FUbshaa	dinosaurs were created on day 6, the same day as man. They fossilized because of the floodwaters in the days of Noah. Fossilization is caused by flooding. Dinosaur remains worldwide are associated with water-laid sediment.<br>  <br>  But they didn't go extinct until people killed them off. This is where dragon legends came from. There's all kind of dragon legends all over the world of people killing dragons, which were strikingly similar to that of dinosaurs.|`|znjl6WrWaa	God created animals before man. and there is mention of "behemoths" in the Bible. Biblical scholars speculate that this is referring to dinosaurs because there are no other animals that match the description given in the Bible. The word "dinosaur" is a relatively modern term.|`|icaatrmhaa	After, because God created animals first (Genesis 1:20-27).<br>  He doesn't specifically say "dinosaurs", but He does say<br>  "wild animals". Dinosaurs were wild animals and we know<br>  that they did exist, because of the bones we've found.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question. Best wishes and God bless!!!|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Adam and Eve were created alongside the dinosaurs, during the week of Creation. <br>  <br>  Dinosaurs are in the Bible.  The word "dinosaur" wasn't in English until the 1800's, so before that, they used the words "dragon" and "behemoth", both of which are in the Bible.    :)|`|A4S9jAuVaa	Dinosaurs were created on day six, the same day Adam was created. The word dinosaur did not exist when the Bible was translated but the words: dragon, behemoth, and Leviathan are in the Bible and some believe that they are describing what we consider dinosaurs.|`|rRVzWFYZaa	People were created after dinosaurs, although we don't know the period of time because time for God is different than time for us.|`|xzKwyQEqaa	Well, after because God created the animals before man.|`|OQFuO3Jdaa	same time. check Genisus in the Bible :)

Not all hood nlggas are gangstas and drug dealers and not all poor black people are crackheads and criminals.|`|EufLQ9dKaa	She want's a man from the hood.  A Goon is another word for them. Most are black and there are a few white goons out there as well.  This man is usually not afraid of anyone, can protect her, good in bed and is not ashamed of who he is nor does he worry about what everyone else is doing. He is confident and may or may not be educated.  Goons are not just poor they are at every economic level.  Overall, she wants her man to keep it real not be restricted by what other people think he should be doing!|`|vanUYJjjaa	Now that you know what it means, DO NOT use this slang. It's tacky, ignorant and undesirable. If you are a self respecting European, you would not contact her, unless you wanted sex.

FBrwlhPtaa	The bible does not give the age of the Earth. However, if you add up the genealogies it comes to around 6,000 years old. The Earth was NOT created in 7 days. Everything was created in 6 days. The creation story is to be taken literally. Some misguided churches teach this as allegory.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Sumerian text and other artifacts dug up in ancient Mesopotamia have been dated to 5000 BC.|`|AA11690436	Actually, the bible itself never makes that claim.  Young Eathers base THEIR claim on the calculations made by Bishop Usher in the seventeenth century.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ussher" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Usshe...</a>|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Wrong -<br>  <br>  This earth is 6,000 years old - not millions - no one can prove that !<br>  <br>  As to "what passages" - Start with Genesis 5 and add up all the ages you can find there, then go through all the 'begats' to establish the genealogical links and work out the lineage down to Jesus, and Wallah!

He looked at all the "begats" in the bible and the specific ages given and ultimately arrived at date of Genesis being around 4000 BC.  A similar date was arrived at by other scholars and it has become a common date cited by believers in a young earth. The bible doesn't say it's allegory but earth science has shown that such a young age for the earth is impossible.  Believers in the bible are faced with three alternatives.  They can rationalize away the literal mountains of evidence that support an ancient earth.  They can say that the bible is simply wrong on that point, which would tend to undermine everything else in the bible, or they can do as the Catholic church has done which is say that the idea of a young earth is allegorical.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Allegory never "supports" itself, you're supposed to be smart enough to recognize it, that's why people take Literature classes. The Bible never anywhere says the world is 6 or 8 thousand years old. As for the seven days, Genesis 1 is a "worship poem" and the Bible elsewhere says -- quite poetically -- that "a day with the Lord is as a thousand years -- or, in modernspeak, that time is relative. Einstein theorizes that the "time-flow" moves at different "speeds" depending on where you stand -- where you observe from.<br>  I believe the Bible is true, but God is a great creator Who uses all the literary tools at His disposal.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	The seven days was literally seven days. God could have used the appropriate terms if he meant an epoch or an aeon. It probably was indeed seven actual days. God doesn't deceive anyone. He's very transparent.<br>  <br>  The human body is made from the elements. It makes sense that we could be made from soil. <br>  <br>  The Earth's age? I don't know. It's a small matter. What is important is that God did create it, and he loves us. He made us to worship him and serve him, although we fail him miserably all the time- most of all, yours truly.|`|df24e0f368140eb3ced17ed541b9db5daa	The Allegory or interest has not been one of how old the earth is.

That is a theory by "young earth" creationists that think they have the total amount of time humanity has lived based on geneologies in the Bible.  But the fact is we have no way of knowing how many gaps are in them thereby making them unreliable for those purposes.<br>  <br>  Most Christians have no idea and actually rely on science for such answers.  The only problem is that we have to watch out for dogmatic science that insists there is no God.<br>  <br>  We are carbon-based lifeforms so that part is actually quite accurate.|`|taNfM0yLaa	i think it is aprox 6 or 8 million years mabey older|`|QX0PfX4Daa	yes, God said so|`|BSqDYs1eaa	no it is far older|`|BnistnrIaa	Psalms 90:4; 2Peter 3:8 says 1 day for us, is 1,000 for God. Plain as day that's not symbolic. Our bodies turn 2dust when we die - Genesis 3:19; Daniel 12:2; Ecclesiastes 9:5,6. Theres nothing symbolic about that. Up to how strong your faith is in what bible says it fact/literal. And there r things that are symbolic. Like burning in "the lake of fire" at Revelation 20:13-15 <-- why would a "God of Love" 1John 4:8 do that? Fire makes stuff go way forever, completely, with no return.

DfDss68haa	THINGS YOU DO AND DON'T EVEN REALIZE YOU DO:<br>  1. Don't be that white friend who constantly comments on my hair. An ocassional "it looks nice" is allowed. Otherwise, anything you say can be offensive. I don't want to straighten it. My hair type should not be brushed. Don't go"eww" if I tell you I should shampoo everyday. Black hair does not need to be washed that often. It's bound to be a comment about something they know nothing about. It's just safer all around not to say anything.<br>  <br>  2. Not noticing subtle racism,especially in Hollywood. Take a second look at movies like Planet of the Apes, Lord of the Rings, Aladdin, 300, Jungle Book. And I mean really look, imagine yourself as a black person and then watch these movies over again. You will see some Eurocentric racism.<br>  <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15677_9-most-racist-disney-characters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cracked.com/article_15677_9-m...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com/2008/05/28/movies/" rel="nofollow">http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com/2008/05/...</a><br>  <br>  3. Supporting black rights to the point of reverse discrimination. Ignoring the bad things that black people do. We don't need to be patronized. You don't have to feel white guilt.<br>  <br>  4.  Saying that racism is over or that you don't see color. Or tell us that we focus too much on race. Hearing a white person tell me that race doesn't matter is a little like a rich person telling a poor person that money doesn't matter. It just makes you want to slap their smug face. <br>  <br>  5. Saying any of the things that people have answered your question with: slavery is over stop talking about, white people have it the hardest, black people are the ones still keeping racism going. You know, nonsense.<br>  <br>  6. Pretending or genuinely unaware that white privilege exists. I'm telling you right now---it does. Take my word for it. White people have an innate edge in all facets of American life. For example, the severity of Katrina and the subsequent media coverage and response time was about race, not class. I had a white friend try to tell me poor white people have it just as bad as poor black people. No they don't. Accept it and embrace it. And honestly if New Orleans was a more white populated area, chances are the levy would have been fixed long before it had the chance to break. Black and minority lives are worth less in this country. We are more likely to live in toxic areas, we are more likely to get substandard health care and die younger as a result, missing minority children are never broadcast all over the news.<br>  <br>  7. If you have a racist KKK friend who hates blacks, do not then take me to meet him. I actually had a friend do this to me. What an uncomfortable meeting that was. <br>  <br>  8. Eliminate the word "coincidence" from your vocabulary. As in, "It's just a coincidence that Disney made the crows talk black slang and named them Jim Crow." Assume that nothing is a coincidence. Also no longer use the phrase, "Stop being so sensitive." As in, "I'm sure that waitress wasn't being racist when she ignored you and took so long to serve you." Assume that feelings of persecution and racism have basis. If we feel a vibe from someone, 9/10 it usually is racism. I have to worry if new people I meet are going to treat me badly becuase of my race in a way white people do not. See the above situation with the KKK member.<br>  <br>  In the end, if you want to know whether you are being racist it always helps to imagine yourself as a black person. I feel that too many people these days lack empathy and can't see anyone's side but their own.

Of which about 800 are blacks. We moved here 29 yrs ago and there weren't any blacks. More are moving here from Milwaukee and Green Bay.  I have no issues with any race. I personally think that black people are beautiful and I do find myself looking at them, especially the women because of their hair. They wear their hair is such cool ways. I've had the same hairdo since high school.  Once I was in a restuarant and looking at a lady and her family. Her 2 daughter has braids and beads on the ends and tiny bows. I was looking at the detail of their hair but I think I upset the mother and she glared at me, wide-eyed.  She didn't say anything but I think she thought I was doing something wrong. Or looking at them because I've never seen a black person before. I did a odd smile and looked away.<br>  <br>  I'm not racist but when with my son or my parents and we are watching a movie or TV show and I want to make a comment about the actor that is black, I always say "that black guy that was in the hotel"....I don't know how else to mention him. I don't remember names in shows and movies so I always mention them by color, race or color of clothing. I don't think it's racist but maybe it is.<br>  <br>  I do find myself thinking that some blacks are embarrassing. Like Snoop Dogg and other rappers that talk odd, in their own language, or don't use proper English.|`|qvycijbOaa	This is a good question, I am happy you asked it because a lot of whites overlook this problem. One of the factors to unknowingly giving racism is by ignorance; ignorance is a major factor to why people of colour often say that white people are all racist. Blacks and people of minorities whether it be ethnicity or race often learn from a younger age about society and being 'different' to white people. Although I myself admit there are a lot of stupid black people out there, rarely are they ignorant on the subject of race. <br>  <br>  For example, a white person couldn't tell the difference between a black Caribbean and a black African. Rarely would they be able to tell the difference between an Indian and a Pakistani. However,  A black person living in the UK (being the minority) can tell the difference between an Indian and a Pakistani. Or even an Eastern European white, an American or British white. <br>  <br>  I've heard white people, and I hate to generalise, say things such as "Jamaica is the only country in the Caribbean right?" Well, it's an island and no. My Indian or Pakistani friends from school generally would be more aware of different cultures because they themselves aren't the norm. <br>  <br>  White people see the world differently to black people when they are both inhabitants of countries of the Western World. I find that white people can live with tunnel vision of the outside world, because their life is set up to be ideal for a white person without the need of self-exploration like a minority person would have. Which can sometimes promote a society full of ignoramuses. Minority people living amongst a vast majority of white people still need to learn about their culture, thus stepping outside of the box which is set up for a white world. This same fundamental does not apply for white people, therefore, they can live unknowingly of any other cultures except their own because it wouldn't be necessary to them unless they wanted it to be.<br>  <br>  A black person needs white and black culture to find himself in The Western World.<br>  A white person only needs white culture. <br>  <br>  This lifestyle promotes ignorance which can lead to racism. It is the reason why white people that aren't ignorant generally find other cultures very interesting because they have gone out of their way to explore it.|`|TuzIGJpaaa	racism |?rā?siz?m|<br>  noun<br>  the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, esp. so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.<br>  <br>  Carry on being yourself.

But white people do things that make it obvious that they notice the fact that i'm black and that I am either "ghetto" and stereotypical or I'm so kind and "well mannered".<br>  <br>  Once I was on the train and a white woman asked me how i got my hair the way it is, reached out and touched it, and called me ghetto when I told her to get off me.

vhlORK4Waa	PARIS --Maybe they should call it the "Mama Lisa." Researchers studying 3-D images of the "Mona Lisa" say she was probably either pregnant or had just given birth when she sat for Leonardo da Vinci's 16th-century masterpiece. The clue was something she wore. <br>  <br>  Scans turned up evidence of a fine, gauzy veil around Mona Lisa's shoulders -- a garment women of the Italian Renaissance wore when they were expecting, a leading French museum researcher, Michel Menu, told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday. <br>  <br>  As the painting aged, the veil darkened. The thick, dark varnish on the work made it hard even to know what color her dress is -- it has been described as everything from black to brown to green. A piece of fabric draped over Mona Lisa's shoulder was sometimes interpreted as a shawl or a scarf. <br>  <br>  But images obtained from infrared reflectography tell a different story. The veil -- called a guarnello -- is transparent, and it looks similar to a gauzy garment in Sandro Botticelli's "Portrait of a Lady," depicting a pregnant woman with her hand over her stomach. <br>  <br>  Tradition holds that the "Mona Lisa" is a painting of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo, and that Leonardo started painting it in 1503. In France, the painting, on display at the Louvre Museum, is referred to as La Joconde -- the French version of her married name. The name Mona Lisa is the equivalent of "Madam Lisa." <br>  <br>  The veil "would confirm art historians' hypothesis that Giocondo asked for a painting of his wife to celebrate the birth of his second son," said Menu, chief of the research department at the French Museums' Center for Research and Restoration, which has its offices in the Louvre. <br>  <br>  The scans also make clear that Mona Lisa does not have her hair down, as it appears. Most of her tresses are pinned back into a chignon and covered with a veil, Menu said. The analyses of hairstyle and clothes were made by Bruno Mottin, curator of the research department at the center.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Halcon

Folks living in the town nearby called her Bloody Mary, and said she was a witch. None dared cross the old crone for fear that their cows would go dry, their food-stores rot away before winter, their children take sick of fever, or any number of terrible things that an angry witch could do to her neighbors. <br>  <br>  Then the little girls in the village began to disappear, one by one. No one could find out where they had gone. Grief-stricken families searched the woods, the local buildings, and all the houses and barns, but there was no sign of the missing girls. A few brave souls even went to Bloody Mary's home in the woods to see if the witch had taken the girls, but she denied any knowledge of the disappearances. Still, it was noted that her haggard appearance had changed. She looked younger, more attractive. The neighbors were suspicious, but they could find no proof that the witch had taken their young ones. <br>  <br>  Then came the night when the daughter of the miller rose from her bed and walked outside, following an enchanted sound no one else could hear. The miller's wife had a toothache and was sitting up in the kitchen treating the tooth with an herbal remedy when her daughter left the house. She screamed for her husband and followed the girl out of the door. The miller came running in his nightshirt. Together, they tried to restrain the girl, but she kept breaking away from them and heading out of town. <br>  <br>  The desperate cries of the miller and his wife woke the neighbors. They came to assist the frantic couple. Suddenly, a sharp-eyed farmer gave a shout and pointed towards a strange light at the edge of the woods. A few townsmen followed him out into the field and saw Bloody Mary standing beside a large oak tree, holding a magic wand that was pointed towards the miller's house. She was glowing with an unearthly light as she set her evil spell upon the miller's daughter. <br>  <br>  The townsmen grabbed their guns and their pitchforks and ran toward the witch. When she heard the commotion, Bloody Mary broke off her spell and fled back into the woods. The far-sighted farmer had loaded his gun with silver bullets in case the witch ever came after his daughter. Now he took aim and shot at her. The bullet hit Bloody Mary in the hip and she fell to the ground. The angry townsmen leapt upon her and carried her back into the field, where they built a huge bonfire and burned her at the stake. <br>  <br>  As she burned, Bloody Mary screamed a curse at the villagers. If anyone mentioned her name aloud before a mirror, she would send her spirit to revenge herself upon them for her terrible death. When she was dead, the villagers went to the house in the wood and found the unmarked graves of the little girls the evil witch had murdered. She had used their blood to make her young again. <br>  <br>  From that day to this, anyone foolish enough to chant Bloody Mary's name three times before a darkened mirror will summon the vengeful spirit of the witch. It is said that she will tear their bodies to pieces and rip their souls from their mutilated bodies. The souls of these unfortunate ones will burn in torment as Bloody Mary once was burned, and they will be trapped forever in the mirror.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Mary Tudor<br>  <br>  Mary I, daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, was born in 1516 and suffered through a terrible childhood of neglect, intolerance, and ill-health. She was a staunch catholic from birth, constantly resisting pressure from others to renounce her faith, a request she steadfastly refused. She married Philip II of Spain in 1555, but was unable to produce a child.<br>  <br>  Mary began her tumultuous reign at 37 years of age, arriving in London amid a scene of great rejoicing. Following the disarray created by Edward VI's passing of the succession to Lady Jane Grey (Jane lasted only nine days), Mary's first act was to repeal the Protestant legislation of her brother, Edward VI, hurling England into a phase of severe religious persecution. Her major goal was the re-establishment of Catholicism in England, a goal to which she was totally committed. Persecution came more from a desire for purity in faith than from vengeance, yet the fact remains that nearly 300 people (including former Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer and many of the most prominent members of society) were burned at the stake for heresy, earning Mary the nickname, "Bloody Mary."<br>  <br>  Mary's marriage to the militant Catholic Philip was again designed to enforce Roman Catholicism on the realm. Unfortunately for Mary, two factors compelled opposition to her plans: the English people hated foreigners - especially the Spanish - and twenty years of Protestantism had soured the English on popery. She met with resistance at every level of society, and, unlike her father and brother, failed to conform society into one ideological pattern. Philip II, cold and indifferent to both Mary and her realm, remained in England for only a short time. He coerced Mary to enter into war with France, resulting in defeat and the loss of the last English continental possession, Calais. With the retirement of his father, Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, Philip returned to Spain; Mary died a mere ten months later.<br>  <br>  England suffered during the reign of Mary I: the economy was in ruin, religious dissent reached a zenith and England lost her last continental territory. Jane Austen wrote this rather scathing commentary about Mary: "This woman had the good luck of being advanced to the throne of England, in spite of the superior pretensions, Merit and Beauty of her Cousins Mary Queen of Scotland and Jane Grey. Nor can I pity the Kingdom for the misfortunes they experienced during her reign, since they fully deserved them..."<br>  <br>  Don't know what you mean about a mirror, maybe that's a different story and nothing to do with mary tudor?<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|UImdKfUSaa	im not positive but i think someone like a nanny killed her and she comes back. i once heard a story that at my school 2 girls went in the bathroom turned out the lights and did it and they were both found headless in the bathroom with their heads no where to be found and i believe it!|`|7vqIoUAKaa	a bloody mary is also a cocktail drink<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Mary_(cocktail)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Mary...</a>|`|fbd41793724db36b70eff30aebe40d0caa	A delicious drink that goes great with a stalk of celery in it.

We do it all the time, son!|`|2Hot9EJiaa	absolutely.  God cares about every aspect of your life. From the smallest to the largest.  He is the one that will eventually put you and your wife together as well.  When you pray thought make sure that you are asking God to send the girl that He desires into your life.  This may not mean that he sends you the one that you will eventually marry- but you always want to make sure that your relationships that you do have honors Him at all times.|`|AA11297267	Sure.  I can't personally see how "asking" somebody who's been dead for a couple thousand years (if he ever existed at all) to help find a girlfriend is going to do any good...but hey, knock yourself out.<br>  You might try socializing, too -- that works without Jesus :)<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|AA11382947	Yes, that is fine to ask.<br>  <br>  Even Chris and I agree on this one!|`|AA11002471	Jesus has greater priorities FOR YOU than a girlfriend.<br>  Put first things first and the rest will follow.<br>  Matthew 6:33|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Nothing wrong with that.|`|0JE41mXsaa	Sure.

You don't need to ask Him on a daily basis to make sure He doesn't forget about you, because He could never forget about you.  Just ask Him one time, and know that He will take care of it the way he had planned on taking care of it anyway.  <br>       The real question is, what will you do with the gifts you are given?  Will you hate how she asks too many questions?  Will you take matters into your own hands if she cheats on you?  Will you sift through the girlfriends to make sure you end up with the one you were intended for?  Realize that the only relationship you get to take to Heaven with you is the one you maintain with God, I'd focus on that relationship and thank Him for any others you receive.  Keeping that in mind during the maintenance of said relationships.

In traffic, it's not a line, it's lanes, and as long as you're following the laws, you're quite free to pass people where the lane markers permit (if you didn't, it would take forever to get anywhere, but then in the US, there is a lot different traffic than in the UK, which is where I gather you live by the word "queue"). <br>  <br>  In a line, it's a first-come-first-serviced type of thing, so the rules are much different.|`|sbnUAllfaa	Many years ago I did, remember we drive on the left in the UK.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Kanji is not used for non-Japanese names. Ever. That's like writing Japanese words using English letters on Japanese official documents; it's just strange and not done.<br>  <br>  "Ashley" is just "Ashley" in Japanese, only written as アシリー ("ashree").|`|bI3tHiD5aa	your name can be devided to A-SHU-LEE in japanese pronounciation.<br>  <br>  the best kanji for A-あ is 亜(Next or Asia), 会(to meet)　or 明(light). other kanjis arent really for a name.<br>  <br>  SHU-しゅ would be 朱(red),守(to protect) or 珠(jewelry)<br>  <br>  ＬＥＥ-りー would be 李(plum),利(benefit),理(logic),莉(jasmine),里... 梨(pear)or 璃(lapis lazuli)<br>  <br>  so, for examle, your name could be 亜朱梨 <br>  <br>  I dont mean to disturb otrher people but to me, アシリー doesnt sound right. Ashley is always translated as アシュリー in japanese. I'm japanese by the way.|`|ANuwrzQ3aa	Ashley san, your mane sounds good. Because girl’s names ending “li” are popular in Japan. And these have pure and cute image. (This is just my feeling). So I will contrive to create the new name for you.<br>  The possible Kanji for “Ashi” which are used for the name of person’s second name, the country or the lake should be:<br>  芦屋、芦谷、芦原、芦ノ湖、葦笛、葦原: <br>  These has somewhat prestigious or artless image. <br>  Here you can choice from 葦　a reed, or 芦.<br>  Some popular names of girls ending ri are;<br>  Mari:真理、麻里、真里、麻利、茉莉<br>  Yuri:由里、由梨<br>  Kanji for “li” used in these names are;<br>  理　reason/right, 梨 a pear, 李　a greengage,里　a village<br>  莉,璃,利<br>  Now, you will be able to combine two of Kanji. Any combination you make might be understood easily by the most of Japanese, I think. <br>  Which one do you like? Good luck.|`|g54tGcRvaa	Your Katakana name would be something like Ashiri (アシリ).  There's no single way to convert this to Kanji (there's no majick English to Kanji name function).  I'll oblige anyway and try to come up with one for you...<br>  For "Ashi" you can use 脚(Leg) or 足(Foot)<br>  For "Ri" or "Rii", I don't know...<br>  ...It just doesn't work like this.<br>  "Shiri" is 尻(Butt), and "A" can be 唖(Dumb), so 唖尻 could mean "Dumbass", except that would be an improper mixing of onyomi and kunyomi furigana.  "A" could be 亜(Asia), so 亜尻 could be "Asian ***".  Don't blame me, I didn't write the language.
6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You're confusing aggressive for assertive.  Assertive means they are kind of no-nonsense, say what they mean, mean what they say.  Aggressive means they are bullies and open only to their own ideas and desires.<br>  <br>  There's no need to be aggressive back for no reason just because you're passing by one of them.  The best approach is to be calm and accommodating.  If you cannot be ruffled, they aren't happy and will usually move on to another victim.|`|zRPXczxAaa	Co-workers who present confrontational situations in the workplace are way--way--out of line.  Start from there.  First of all it is your duty as a loyal employee to make the workplace as agreeable as you can for your fellow employees.  So you do what you can to minimize the unpleasant effect of the scene being made an unmannerly co-worker who does not, apparently, understand this primary obligation to his job and his fellow employees:  You simultaneously shush him (giving him to understand that you'll discuss it privately with him, as soon as you both have an opportunity to do so), and brightly and smilingly, treat his outburst as a brilliantly humorous, basically helpful reminder of problems you all face.  In other words, you try to act like a civilized and responsible adult (who happens at the moment to have to deal with a petulant and irresponsible child).|`|ej9ijnS7aa	You do realize you just described yourself?  <br>  <br>  "My way of dealing with it is by giving them dirty looks and just walking by and giving them the cold shoulder which infuriates them further and makes the situation worse"<br>  <br>  Isn't this attitude?|`|rThIVk2maa	"Confrontations" are almost never needed, especially at work, and polite people avoid them at all costs. Continue to keep your cool and cultivate phrases like "How kind of you to take notice", "Interesting.", and "Thank you for taking an interest". These all cheerfully translate into a far less polite phrase that you, of course, will never stoop to utter but whose message you need to get across.|`|2zLtIog3aa	Think about this... Why did he/she turned out to be the way they are? Most likely they were hurt or intimidated and they have developed this front. As humans we operate on a lot of instinct. To prevent from being hurt, humiliated, or intimidated we put on a strong front. (Just like a blow fish blows up when they feel threatened) Next time you approach a person like that, just nod you head, blink once, and with a lite smile say hi. Then just walk away. <br>  After several times the front will come down.|`|w4kdTalPaa	Do exactly what you have been doing except instead of giving the dirty looks smile at them instead.|`|Lv9rLFgwaa	Without being confrontational i suppose you could ignore them and hope they stop.<br>  Being as little confrontational as you can, you could sit down and talk to them about there problems with you.<br>  Full confrontation, full blow argument to put them in your place.<br>  <br>  ^3 best options :)|`|JpRBvUobaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I think you mean aggressive people..<br>  <br>  Assertive people see things from all points of view and are diplomatic. <br>  <br>  The best way round this is not to be like them. Don't join in banter or aggravate them. Explain to senior colleagues how they make YOU feel.<br>  These people are not worth you being so upset. If you are a good worker then you should be recognized. <br>  <br>  I bet your workplace would miss you more than them if it came to people leaving. If you cannot talk to anyone senior or it is them that's the problem then try and speak to HR. <br>  I work hard in my job and I do come across some horrible people but I just tell myself they are jealous of my passion for my job. This motivates me to carry on because they are just really immature and pathetic. I could easily move on and they need me in this job. I am a credit to the company and HR know that.

I guess that's what I get for being a middle class white male suburbanite.|`|7J9Eb3VCaa	I'm not sure what you mean by broken. I think the modern gender roles have increased the productivity of society. Now there are double the amount of people in the work field. Women feel more confident and use full. Some women still have the traditional gender roles and that's great for them there is definitely room for both types of roles. Some women feel use full by raising a family which is a full time job on it's own. While other women want more of a challenge or don't have families. As for the guys the playing field is leveled they have the chance to possibly stay home at the homemaker that way there isn't any resentment going on.
MnFj47dxaa	There's absolutely no reason for you to feel badly about the situation.  Especially if you're certain she has gone through your things - I would have kicked her out on the spot after that.  She's just rude and inconsiderate.  And the fact that she doesn't have the consideration to close the refrigerator door (I mean, come on!  common sense, huh?) means she obviously won't understand why you're upset.  I had a roommate that hated me because I got mad once when she turned the AC on with all the windows open when it was 15 degrees cooler outside than it was in the house.  People like that will never understand where you're coming from, and will never get past the fact that you confronted her about her bad habits.  Good riddance!|`|2rdXW293aa	She can't leave fast enough; she's a snoop and possibly a thief. Going through your meds? Unbelievable.

FIXKYCIGaa	Religion is not like watching a sporting event.  Someone who is an avid Football fan can go to a baseball game one day but to a person of genuine faith, their religion is an integral part of their existence.  It would be no more possibly for a devout follower of a particular faith to "swap faiths" for a day than it would be possible for them to stop breathing for a day.  A Jew can read the Koran or a Christian can read the teachings of Buddha in an attempt to understand those other faiths, but asking them to actually change their faith for a day is not realistic.|`|KmULmT7Baa	Why would I go from intelligent to misinformed?|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Sounds good in theory.

yoS4cAszaa	I think the world today is just ridiculous. People are selfish and do whatever they want. Kids are having sex younger and younger and everyone is doing drugs. A good majority of people don't have a religion or don't practice it and i think religion would help peoples morality because there doesn't seem to be any anymore. I think there are some great people in the world but most people are pretty messed up, like the Anothony woman who killed her daughter. What has this world come to?????|`|61c8oevtaa	Ok, well I think the world today is very unequal, much more than it should be. The rich people are getting richer and the poor people are getting poorer.

It seems wrong to me that we spend money on things like space exploration when there are people all over the world who desperately need that money for simple things like food, water and disease prevention.<br>  <br>  I know it's cliched and we hear people saying all this over and over, but it's true, and it really does make me sad.|`|LURqbzoZaa	I think the world today is way to overcomplicated, and we have so many things around us that we lose track of what is really important.|`|fu0ZEpLfaa	The world has a lot of hate in it these days.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

The Bible was came about through ongoing revelation through contemporary prophets.  <br>  <br>  The same is true today.  <br>  <br>  The Book of Mormon was more or less contemporary with much of the Bible (From about Jerimiah to about 350 or so years after the death of the apostles.)  More than anything, the Book of Mormon helps to clarify many teachings in the Bible.  A few of these deal with infant baptism, the sacrament, the priesthood, the nature of God, and Christ's involvement with others who lived in the Americas.  <br>  <br>  Our 9th article of faith makes it clear that we believe in continuous and ongoing revelation.

The Book of Mormon is supposed to contain "the fullness of the everlasting Gospel" (see Pearl of Great Price, p.51, v.34). In the Doctrine and Covenants 42:12 we read: "And again, the elders, priests, and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel."  <br>  <br>  However, despite being the 'keystone' of the Mormon religion, it does not contain any of the unique Mormon doctrines. <br>  <br>  The Book of Mormon teaches one God, not plural gods as in Mormonism. It teaches that God is a spirit not a resurrected man with a physical body. It mentions heaven and hell, not three degrees of glory, no temple marriage or secret temple ceremonies (in fact it condems 'secret combinations'). It does not teach pre-existence of man, eternal progression or polygamy. <br>  <br>  Even though the Book of Mormon is supposed to contain the "fulness of the gospel," it never mentions the doctrine of baptism for the dead, not even once! The word "baptism" appears twenty-five times in the Book of Mormon. The word "baptize" appears twenty-eight times. The word "baptized" appears eighty-five times, and the word "baptizing" appears six times, but the doctrine of baptism for the dead is not mentioned at all!<br>  <br>  One of the most objectionable doctrines in the Book of Mormon is its view of skin color. White skin is seen as desirable, dark skin is seen as a mark of God's displeasure. <br>  <br>  Smith wrote the Book of Mormon in the late 1820's. Over the next fifteen years his doctrines underwent radical changes which are seen in his revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price.|`|Mnm35sjNaa	Of course.  It's an organized religion, after all!<br>  <br>  There's one historic doctrine in particular that I'd like to cover in the following true story . . .<br>  <br>  . . . One time, 2 young Mormon women came a-knockin'.  They were both very attractive, polite and wholesome.  One of them was black.  I asked her why she chose to be a Mormon when the Book of Mormon contains insulting bigotry against black people.  Here's the verse I'm referring to:<br>  <br>  ????2 Nephi 5:21<br>  ????"And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them."<br>  <br>  ????See also: Mormon 5:15, Alma 3:6, Alma 3:9, Alma 3:14<br>  <br>  Can you believe that?  God made the descendants of Cain black so that they “might not be enticing” unto white people.  Blatant, transparent racism right in the "holy" Book of Mormon!  Not only is it racist, it's a bald-faced lie!!<br>  <br>  The white woman spoke up for the black woman and said that racism has been renounced by the Mormon church.  The black woman agreed.<br>  <br>  I asked how the Mormon church got the authority to renounce a verse from their "divinely inspired" Book of Mormon: could they override God's word?  They pulled out their "brown books" but could not find an answer.<br>  <br>  I then pointed out that if God really inspired the Book of Mormon, it would NEVER need ANY part renounced.  That only happens when humans pretend they're God.<br>  <br>  I told them that there were already far too many religions in the world before Mormonism came along.  How can God blame anybody for choosing the wrong religion?  Will he really condemn billions of people to hell because they guessed wrong?<br>  <br>  I suggested they keep an open mind and try to place their faith in scripture that doesn't contain ideas and practices that we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  What I didn't say was that, if they really tried to follow my advice, they wouldn't find ANY scripture WITHOUT ideas and practices we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  I must say that, despite the outcome of our conversation, the 2 young ladies remained open and engaged.  I didn’t detect any animosity.  However, when they eventually left, they were visibly shaken.|`|d11ac1603c7e53d874cecaa7631b2aa0aa	First: The Bible and Book of Mormon have nothing in common.

AA11615514	Being bi doesn't mean he is destined to be unfaithful to you emotionally or sexually. It is all up to him how faithful he will be. If he is determined to be faithful he will be. If he intends to seek out male lovers he will find them. It's like a straight partner being determined not to stray. You need to decide what sort of relationship you want. Do you want him to only have sex with you or is it okay if he has affairs with men on the side? Once you've decided what you want from him you need to talk to him about what he has in mind. If you're expecting different things you'll need to make compromises or go your separate ways.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I am a bisexual man who has been married to a woman for 22 years, and I've never cheated on her with a man.  All I hear in this question is blah, blah, blah.  The "gay side of him"?  Please.  That's like a straight guy's small breasted wife wondering if she will be able to satisfy the "big breast loving side of him".  Nobody fulfills all of anybody's sexual desires.  Part of being married is giving up the idea of ever having *everything* you want because the person you've found is so darn wonderful.  Look at it this way: if you can go without jumping and humping other males that you're attracted to, so can he.

It is VERY HARD to explain but I'll do my best to explain it to you:<br>  <br>  An "albur" basically consists on making "wordplays" which their meaning usually are in a sexual way.<br>  <br>  For example, in this case the guy is saying "apachurro" (apachurrar is a verb that means "splat" (with a car or a train), or it also might be "squeeze" something). At the same time, he is refusing the term, and it's in that moment when the wordplay takes place.<br>  <br>  It literally means: "I splat, but I'm not a train".<br>  <br>  But "splat" goes in a sexual way, so it has to be "squeeze". <br>  <br>  In English it doesn't make any sense!!!! But think about it as "what does a man or boy like to squeeze?" And I'm not talking about the ketchup...|`|zjxr6fRsaa	apachurro means= squish e.g.' he likes to squish me all the time'..<br>  'a el le gusta apachurrarme todo el tiempo'.<br>  and about the rest....hmmm...???<br>  'y no soy tren' (doesn't even make sense)=' and i'm not train'

Proverbs 8:22-31<br>  <br>  Sincerely  Jesus|`|JTQ84aLKaa	Yahweh's or Jehovah created only one Being.<br>  <br>   The Bible teaches that Jesus lived in heaven before he came to earth. Micah prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem and also said that His origin was “from early times.” (Micah 5:2) On many occasions, Jesus himself said that he lived in heaven before being born as a human. (John 3:13; 6:38,?62; 17:4,?5) As a spirit creature in heaven, Jesus had a special relationship with Jehovah.<br>  <br>   Jesus is Jehovah’s most precious Son—and for good reason. He is called “the firstborn of all creation,” for he was God’s first creation. (Colossians 1:15) There is something else that makes this Son special. He is the “only-begotten Son.” (John 3:16) This means that Jesus is the only one directly created by God. Jesus is also the only one whom God used when He created all other things. (Colossians 1:16) Then, too, Jesus is called “the Word.” (John 1:14) This tells us that he spoke for God, no doubt delivering messages and instructions to the Father’s other sons, both spirit and human.<br>  <br>  But that was Jesus's name when he was in heaven? It certainly was not Jesus.<br>  <br>  Aside from Michael, no archangel is mentioned in the Bible, nor do the Scriptures use the term “archangel” in the plural. The Bible describes Michael as the archangel, implying that he alone bears that designation. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that Jehovah God has delegated to one, and only one, of his heavenly creatures full authority over all other angels.<br>  <br>  Aside from the Creator himself, only one faithful person is spoken of as having angels under subjection—namely, Jesus Christ. (Matthew 13:41; 16:27; 24:31) The apostle Paul made specific mention of “the Lord Jesus” and “his powerful angels.” (2?Thessalonians 1:7) And Peter described the resurrected Jesus by saying: “He is at God’s right hand, for he went his way to heaven; and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.”—1?Peter 3:22.<br>  <br>  While there is no statement in the Bible that categorically identifies Michael the archangel as Jesus, there is one scripture that links Jesus with the office of archangel. In his letter to the Thessalonians, the apostle Paul prophesied: “The Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.” (1?Thessalonians 4:16) In this scripture Jesus is described as having assumed his power as God’s Messianic King. Yet, he speaks with “an archangel’s voice.” Note, too, that he has the power to raise the dead.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is "Michael the Archangel" later sent to be born on eearth and then names Jesus.|`|XL25SEVnaa	1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br>  <br>   2 Now the earth was [a] formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.|`|AAGW4kAhaa	The Bible says that Jesus (or Yeshua) was "with Him" or resided within Him as he created everything.

This was the event- nothing more, nothing less- RIGHTEOUS ANGER|`|Of0H9i4Vaa	Imagine the smell and the nasty mess......<br>  <br>  Springtime, A.D. 30, with six months of gospel-preaching behind, with the whole country awakening to the Messiah’s presence, it was time for Jesus to go up to Jerusalem for the annual Passover. There he found the money-changers and those that sold oxen, sheep and pigeons right in the temple. Fired with the zeal of Jehovah, Jesus made a whip of cords and, turning over the money tables and driving out dealers, cattle and all, said: “Away with these! My Father’s house is not to be turned into a shop!”—John 2:13-17, Mo.<br>  <br>  That final and great week, the last act, so to speak, of a stupendous drama and one which climaxed Jesus’ public ministry, was staged in and around Jerusalem. Riding into Jerusalem in triumphal procession, Christ offered himself as King amid joyful acclaim. Then he cleansed the temple the second time by driving out the religious racketeers who had made his Father’s house a den of thieves. (Matt. 21:1-16) The next day, in his parables Jesus exposed the clergy as the ones that would be guilty of rejecting and killing the Messiah, the heir of the Kingdom, and further denounced them, saying: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!” And to the nation as a whole he said: “Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.”—Matt. 21:17 to 23:39. The Jewish system of things are ending......Jesus illustrated these changes for poor and rich in his parable of the beggar Lazarus and the rich man. He pictured the changes as coming by death.|`|G49lKR56aa	The Lord Jesus got angry that the moneychangers were using God house for transactions of no good (politely said).<br>  <br>  God bless!|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Economic stimulus package.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	It is known as Fantasy.|`|tOWqXCdtaa	I cannot describe it, since I was not there. <br>  <br>  But the Bible describes it thusly:<br>  <br>  12Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. 13"It is written," he said to them, " 'My house will be called a house of prayer,'[e] but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'<br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:12-13;&version=31;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  And Pontius Pilate describes it thusly:<br>  <br>  The affair of Jesus is coming to a head. Yesterday, accompanied by his immediate followers, he visited the Temple. He stopped in the outer court, which is an enormous place like a fair-ground, full of the paraphernalia for Temple-gifts and sacrifices, and thronged by thousands of Jews chaffering and arguing at the top of their voices in a score of languages and dialects. You know that market of theirs in Rome which one takes visitors to see from curiosity. It is like that, with a hundred times the hubbub. Suddenly Jesus began to assail his enemies the priests and all their works in the most violent terms. So far as I can learn, he denounced the whole ritual-mongering business of the Temple. Very sensible, too, except for his own safety. Had he been understood or attracted wide attention he would have been murdered on the spot. If you remember that the life of these Jews, not only here but to the far ends of the earth, centres in the Temple-worship and that it is a highly organized business controlled by a powerful and jealous corporation, you will see that only a madman or a suicide would act like this. As it went, there was only a scuffle and the thing passed off. It was rather like his entry into the City. He himself speaks Aramaic and a large part of his hearers would have no idea of his meaning.<br>  <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~owen_eir/letter31.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/~owen_eir/lett...</a>|`|WYk0zYdhaa	Not sure what you mean but the bible calls this cleansing the temple.

I wasn't even thinking about fairies at all - but maybe they were thinking about me...|`|dFBccLExaa	I have doubts about whether the picture was real. The fae are on a different plane than us. Seeing one of them is like seeing a ghost or spirit- it's not something that's overly tangible. I see them as balls of light. Normally, they only show up around my house or nature. <br>  If you want to attract the fae to you, you can leave them offerings of milk, honey, bread, sweets, etc for them, and ask them to allow you to form a relationship with them.|`|msNXomjTaa	The pic of the mummified fairy is a very famous fake from about 80 years ago (if I recall correctly). <br>  <br>  Few believe that fairies are real, yet almost all cultures have stories of "little people."

You will draw it's hairstyle, it's clothing, it's shoes, etc. You will make up a name for it and write it on the piece of paper. Once you have written the name, write the gender of the fairy. After writing the gender of the fairy, write it's powers. (Don't create an evil fairy please.) Then, for about 10 seconds, imagine the fairy coming, and concentrate really hard on that.(Not so hard you feel pain) Once the 10 seconds are up the fairy will come in about 5 minutes or so. <br>  <br>  NOTE: If it does not come in a day, that's natural, sometimes it takes a while for them to recieve your message. <br>  <br>   <br>  or if you were looking for information try 43thing.com they might have some thing there<br>  hoped that helped :)|`|AA10544917	I met a few fairies in my day but they all turned out to be freaks.

70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	If I had children, I would go as far as to risk my life to protect them from danger. I guess I'll do the same for my mom and dad or anybody in my family. If a family member was in the street and a car was fast approaching and doesn't appear to be stopping, I would step in front of the fast moving car to save my loved ones.|`|0lpXN8p9aa	Happiness is within you. No one else can give it to you.|`|Or7wuZpaaa	If I have to die to protect those I love from suffering harm, I'd do it because I am a self-sacrificing kind of guy. That's how far I would go and what I'd be willing to lose. Endure pain and go through death and sleep if it meant those I love could continue breathing and functioning. My relatives, my friends, everybody I care about. Knowing them, they would probably cry and scream my name at my funeral as they observe my casket and feel my cold body, but that's fine. I don't care about myself if it comes down to me and someone I love being in danger. I'd gladly perish to protect and save those I care about. In the end, I get to sleep and have no more pain while everyone crying will have pain but it will eventually fizzle out and they'll get over it.
zGtppekAaa	WOW!  Im a photographer too, and I would have been very upset about this as well.  My thinking would be that an email would have been adequate if you had gotten it and responded back.  The client should have called you to make SURE that you got his email before you left, since you hadnt responded to him.  That is crazy.  I hope you got a deposit from him before hand!!!  Next time I would require a deposit and make known that you need x hours notice for cancellation.|`|3becff333a551f4097226dfe2aae0006aa	I agree that a phone call would have been better.  However, he may have assumed that you had a Blackberry, or an audible alert for incoming e-mail on your computer, or that you checked your e-mail at every opportunity.  It might be a good idea to start doing that.|`|iPje1iyGaa	In today's day and age, it is expected that people will receive e-mails as quickly as a phone call.  However, to be courteous, he should have called to make sure you received the e-mail.|`|JpRBvUobaa	Out of common curtsy I would have done both. I would have hated the thought of someone waiting for me to turn up.<br>  <br>  This I feel was a bad client.|`|MnFj47dxaa	Emotionally, I don't blame you for a second for being outraged that he would flake out like that.  I don't think an email at 10:30 pm, for an apointment 7.5 hours later, and no phone call to ensure you got the message, is adequate notice.  You have every right to be angry!<br>  <br>  Unemotionally, unless something in your contract specifically states that appointments need to be cancelled x number of hours before the appointment starts, and outlines cancellation fees, or deposits that will be forefitted, etc, you can't do much.  But, I certainly would add these provisions to your contract from here on out.  <br>  <br>  What a jerk!|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	This was rude and presumptive behavior. E-mails don't always get read on a regular basis...especially at 4 a.m.  The most courteous, professional and effective way to notify you would have been to call you.  At 10:30 p.m., chances are that you'd have actually answered the call...or at least they would have been able to leave a voicemail.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	I agree with Aporia, a cancellation fee with less than 24 hour notice would be a good addition to your contract.  Time is money in your business, and that wasted time could have been filled with someone who would actually show up and pay you.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	People generally expect that other people and businesses get their email immediately, or at least check for any when they have an appointment.  I would certainly be checking the timestamp of the email to see if the guy is legit, but 10:30 the night before is late notice.<br>  <br>  In the future I suggest you establish a 24 or 48 cancellation policy and probably even require deposits.  It's certainly not unheard in professional photography, and while I'm sure you are trying to be a friendlier and more accessible photographer, you have now encountered that random guy who ruins it for everyone.|`|w4kdTalPaa	Yes he should have called you. Who checks E-mails at four in the morning. I would be upset too.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	This is 2009 where email is a way of life.<br>  <br>  Did you in fact get the email even if you did not check it on time?|`|rThIVk2maa	You're missing an important step in your contract, the no-show charge. This is to protect both you and your client, there should be a rather sizable charge for clients who cancel without notifying you (which can include email and phone) at least 24-48 hours in advance. This holds up in court and is a good policy for anybody in your situation.<br>  <br>  Point it out when they sign their agreement and be sure they initial next to that clause. Even hotels charge for people who don't cancel at least 24 hours ahead of time! <br>  <br>  This client can go directly to your "banned" list.

963d63f6d3d4458368e99dbfe9b34914aa	Hmmm... that's a tricky one. <br>  <br>  I'm gay, and most of my guy friends are straight. You have to realize that they are playing a COMPLETELY different game than you. They're going AFTER the girls, and you're just trying to be their friend.<br>  <br>  It's hard at first, because most guys are weirded out by gay guys, BUT if you can manage to find a few guy friends, and they become actual FRIENDS... then other guys follow the lead, and i'm assuming you become a "safe" gay, because they can generally be sure you're not gonna jump on them (even if you want to).<br>  <br>  Guys don't wanna talk about emotions or feelings. They talk about the stupidest things, in my opinion, but you can learn a lot from them, and they are hilarious to talk **** about girls with. The other day in the car, I was driving home from a weekend of partying with three other guys, and we were just bitching about how bad girls suck, and going on and on about the funniest examples of why our girl-friends suck and annoy the hell out of us, and why girls are CRAZY (at least for guys they seem like it)<br>  <br>  Most gay guys would be offended, and probably run and tell the girls, but it's guy code to leave that type of talk with guys, because it never forms into actions, and they are just venting... not putting the girls down in any way the girl would ever know.|`|H2IqzG12aa	You really need to be having this discussion with someone who actually knows you.<br>  <br>  In my case, I have what I call "Teflon" relationships.  I just don't stay in touch with anyone, people drift in and out of my life, and I drift in and out of theirs.  I think it stems from a lifetime of living in the closet and being afraid of anyone really getting to know me, of finding out my "secret."  I've just never learned to bond with anyone, keep too much to myself.<br>  <br>  In any case, these days if you have one best friend and two or three more good friends, you're lucky.  Try just putting yourself "out there" more, especially around anyone with whom you share an interest or two.|`|LGkb4xibaa	eh. You should really talk to one of your long term friends about this. They could probably tell you more than anyone where they think your going wrong.<br>  <br>  Personally, i only have a close knit group of friends who i can rely on. And i'm happy with that. I'd rather that than lots of half-arsed friends that arent loyal to me.<br>  <br>  If you wanna branch out, start by looking at why you run out of conversation when you talk to them. <br>  <br>  Do you just not find them interesting? In which case your talking to the wrong people. Try going to different places where you'll meet people similar to you.<br>  <br>  If you feel you dont have anything to say, maybe you feel low in self- worth. If you run out of conversation, maybe joke with them or ask them about themselves instead.  <br>  <br>  If for some reason you feel inferior to heterosexual men,  then that might also effect how your acting. Maybe you seem quiet/unconfident for that reason. In which case, get it out your head your inferior. Because your not. <br>  <br>  Maybe your feeling uncomfortable to be too friendly with them in case they get the wrong idea and think your attracted to them. If thats the case you might seem cold. <br>  <br>  Hopefully the guys in your year arent homophobic in any way. But if your talking to a guy and you think its a problem, then hes not worth talking to. <br>  <br>  Eh. It could be a whole load of other reasons too, but i'd have to know you better to really say...which i dont! So if its none of the above, really, ask a friend. Its better than feeling miserable or worrying X|`|3uRM7FKIaa	It's not an easy thing to make and maintain a friendship. Most people think of online chat buddies as their friends now days and isn't that ludicrous? Anyway as you say you have a small group of friends why does it matter that you have these sixth formers too? You obviously have no problem holding up your end of a friendship so maybe the problem isn't really you. <br>  It could be as you say the gossip hounds or maybe you are more mature than they are and find what they are interested in IE girls and drinking childish.<br>  <br>  Not knowing you makes it difficult to answer this  but it would seem to me that it really isn't your problem.|`|AA11099833	I am not sure how to answer.  I do not have or maintain friendships either.  I have plenty of acquaintances and associates.  But I would not call many of them friends.  I don’t even have lots of female friends.  I wonder whether I try too hard, or not hard enough.  Maybe a part of me is too personal – meaning I enjoy solitude and get antsy when people become too personal.  I do have a LTR and have done well with maintaining that kind of relationship.  But with plutonic friends, I am the same way you are?  :-(|`|tyClwxEBaa	Start smiling! You gotta seem approachable to the guys. <br>  Sit next to them...this way they'll be more likely to start talking to you first. <br>  Strike up a conversation. If there is a particular guy you like...and you know he loves something, sports for example, watch the game on TV, or if he's a musician, look up a great song on iTunes to share with him. <br>  If they tease you, laugh along with them, or play it up with sarcasm. You can pretend to be mad at them, this can come off as "sibling-ly" conflict. Guys like it when a girl has a sense of humor. <br>  If you become close enough to share an inside joke, repeat it a few times, just to make sure they know you remember it...and that you find your conversations important. <br>  Make sure when you are around the guys, show your great personality and don't seem shy, guys have interest in girls that seem fun and crazy. <br>  If they strike a conversation with you, don't get scared, because guys usually won't put you on the spot or make you uncomfortable. <br>  Go ahead and ask them questions about school or how they are doing, and so on. <br>  Don't seem too desperate to get their attention <br>  If the guy you are talking to has his friends around, it is a great opportunity to introduce yourself and start making more guy friends.|`|nhoiAFLKaa	With guys, one thing I tend to notice is that if they realise someone wants to be their friend, they are put off, you have to be a bit  independent. Don't be too protective over your stuff though, but make it clear you have boundaries and expectations (people are then more eager to meet them, and feel accepted). <br>  Some guys have a bit of an issue with gay guys, so they would definately be put off if you were TOO friendly, but then again, these aren't the kind of guys you want to be friends with. Though it sounds rather cliche, joining clubs and activities make people more aware of those around them with similar interests. Hope this helps x

vvgmyX04aa	I don't know if love triangles Never work out, people are so varied, but I've just never heard of any ending well. <br>  <br>  And it really doesn't matter because clearly you Don't want to share and that's all there is to it. He has to be told that in no uncertain terms and then tell him to make his choice. <br>  <br>  *hugs* This has got to be hard on you. For whatever it's worth, please know that if you stick to what you really want you are doing the right thing and being right by yourself. If nothing else, you will have that and you can carry that into a relationship with someone who appreciates you. All the best.|`|fdMKpXCHaa	You're right.  You may lose him, but if you enter into this in order to keep him, you will certainly lose yourself.  Stand your ground.  If he chooses you, things are fine.  If you do lose him you will be hurt a little.  However, if you enter this relationship with three people you will certainly be hurt much, much more.  It sounds like he's more concerned with his own sexual gratification than he is with your relationship.  When someone is in love with someone, they don't want to share them sexually.  Good luck.|`|x7uRjwseaa	Well what about your feelings? Do you like this other guy as well? If not, then you might end up resenting them both. You should take care of #1 before you take care of any one else's feelings.|`|QWMh8hzzaa	Don't even consider it! Why play 2nd fiddle, if he really loves you he'll be with you.  Tell him you love him and you want him all to yourself, end of story, it's his decision, if he chooses the other guy, then he really  wasn't into your relationship and it was not going to last in the long run.  Do these things ever last (triad)?  Some of them last for awhile, but all 3 have to want to be in it from the start and then after the novelty or whatever wears off, it's splitsville with bad feelings all round.  Save yourself the trauma, tell him you love him, you want to be in a relationship with him, if he wants someone else, then it's over.  Hard to do but worth it in the long run.  Good luck.|`|1469de7bd315f4ada9d0225c451cdd2aaa	By the way you feel now, you'll only feel worse if you do this.  Yeah, love triangles can work out if all parties are feeling it but sooner or later, it will cause major problems.  I think your boyfriend is being really selfish and not considering your feelings.  Oh, and he's most likely been cheating on you with this guy for a while, even before he told you.   You deserve better.  Try to move on.|`|KszocgnSaa	No no no no no. Lol anyway thats a terrible idea. Agreeing to something like that because you don't wanna lose him. Not wanting to lose someone means if you saw them with someone else you would be jealous. If he really likes you he will drop the other guy. Have some pride and say you or the other guy. He may break your heart in the end but at least you did what you should have done and your not losing every ounce of pride you have.|`|e0lfV7skaa	It would only work out if you were as willing as he was to have this arrangement. <br>  <br>  I'm afraid that if you stay with him, you'll have your emotions wrecked.|`|sFjYVH7paa	He says that he wants to include another partner and that you have no say in whether your relationship is monogamous?<br>  <br>  Kick that *ss out.  Or better yet, tell him you want another boy/girl too.  Then, take up with them.  <br>  <br>  You always have a choice in your relationships.  If he doesn't accept that, he doesn't accept you; he just wants to use you.<br>  <br>  He isn't he only one with feelings; you have them too and they are just as valid.|`|MYIwyTpcaa	Polyamoury, or open relationships, can only work if all particpants go into the relationship with eyes wide open.

ickyq53aaa	I hug my guy friends all the time.  If they die in a car crash, I would regret it if I had not hugged them.  When you lose friends or family, you realize that you should show people how you feel about them.  Giving someone a hug makes them feel liked, and it is comforting.  I give my friends who are girls hugs, and kisses on the cheek.  It is perfectly healthy and normal to show affection to your friends.  I have a girlfriend, so I wouldn't sit with my arm around another girl just for her sake, but I have done that with casual friends before.  Just don't assume that if a girl hugs you and kisses your cheek that it means you can grab her butt or something.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	I am a girl and have loads of male friends. If you are with close friends they will know the score with you being friends with this girl. There are allot of people that do find it impossible to understand that a guy can be friends with a girl and still care for her. Its not the same as love. I mean no one assumes that girls who give each other hugs and kisses are lesbians, do they ?|`|B3OlFeffaa	Hugging is fine, hugging doesn't always mean something romantic. <br>  Everything else you mentioned I think is your own opinion I mean some girls don';t mind their guy friends being physically "social" (didn't know hot to say that :P)

N8UKu0WUaa	yes, i find it disappointing that a movie with reversed gender roles would not even have made it mainstream, never mind win an oscar.<br>  <br>  i don't see why people can just see love, or attraction as simply that, and understand that no matter someones age, they can hold these feelings, and they can hold these feelings for any one of any age.<br>  <br>  i mean, for example, just tonight i heard on the news, that the 30yo female teacher had been arrested for sexual assault, for have sex with a 14yo male student. i would find it VERY, VERY hard to believe that the male did not want to have the sexual relationship, so i honestly don't see the problem-- there is a reason why the term MILF is used by teenaged boys. >.><br>  <br>  if two consenting parties are have sex (wanted on both sides), i don't think there should be a problem. if there's no attraction involved, there's no attraction involved, you can't simply "take advantage" of someone who has no attraction-- it doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  i think it's very naive to think that attraction like this is uncommon-- it's very common. i know from personally experience (talking with friends); there are multiple teachers at my school (some subs) who my friends (16yo's) have commented that they think are hot, and wanna "get with"-- the teacher must be around their early 30's i imagine.|`|BD8O7RR3aa	I haven't seen it yet.

ObLMLZ74aa	At less than 5 light years away, it is expedient to hope it does.

That means it is impossible to give a meaningful answer to your question. There isn't enough data, everyone is just guessing.<br>  <br>  I think we can say with certainty though that the Alpha Centauri system does not contain a civilization that is using radio, TV, or Radar on a large scale.  If they had radio and radar as powerful as we had 50, 60, perhaps even 70 years ago, it would have been detected by our various SETI programs. <br>  <br>  So there may be a habitable planet there. It may even have life. It may have intelligent life, but we know that if there is any, it isn't using Radio or Radar.  This may mean nobody is there, or it may mean they haven't discovered radio yet, or it could mean they are all using fiber optic data links, or maybe they are all telepathic. <br>  <br>  Or there could be nothing. <br>  <br>  With luck we will know in a few years.|`|19QSiNqgaa	unlikely|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Yes.|`|NrzxtivLaa	no, the Alpha Centauri system does not have planets that we know of, even then, it's a binary system, making it unlikely to have life supporting planets.......besides, we still need to find intelligence on our own planet first|`|AA12203324	Since Cantauri is a trinary system, it is unlikely any planets would have a stable enough climate to support the generation of life.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	I don't think the existence of planets orbiting AC have been confirmed.

It may or may not have life of some sort or another, but intelligent life is a whole different matter. For one thing, the development of intelligent life on two separate systems that are so close is statistically very unlikely, using even very optimistic values for Drake's Equation.|`|ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Vernon and Corrupted, Skepsis IS correct. Alpha Centauri IS a triple star system. Alpha Centauri A is the largets of the three stars having a mass more than the other two combined. Alpha Centauri B and Proxima Centauri both orbit each other in a tight embrace, and both together orbit Alpha Centauri A. Currently Proxima Centauri is the single closest star to the Earth system and will be so for another 20 years when Alpha Centauri B will be the nearer of the three. In about 80 years, Alpha Cenaturi A will become the closer of the three when the Proxima-Centauri B orbit carries the pair to the opposite side of the trinary system of stars.<br>  <br>  Alpha Centauri A is an orange sub-giant star (G0), Alpha Centauri B is a yellow solar sized star(G3) and Proxima is a deep red sub-dwarf. The likelihood of planets is very high as there are a vast number of stable areas in which a planet might orbit any of the three stars. However, the extreme changes in incoming radiation would make the development and survival of life extremely difficult and highly unlikely. It would almost certainly put native intelligent life out of the question. However, There are numerous times throughout the systems orbits about each other in which intelligent life COULD survive for a number of Earth decades and do so quite comfortably. Although the stars are billions of miles apart they are still so close together that the variance in incoming light to any planets within the star system would range from baking hot to extreme cold, often within the space of one Earth year. any native life from that star system would necessarily be completely different from any life here on the Earth.<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the green Witch|`|JTQ84aLKaa	Alpha Centari is most certainly inhabited by intelligent life.<br>  People like Harry Potter and his friends, All those from Lord Of The Rings, Robin Hood and his Merry men, Alice in Wonderland and her friends all come from there.<br>  <br>  How could you doubt it?|`|6Ao8Bskfaa	And this is in the R& S section because? <br>  <br>  Oh and no, it is not possible for life to exist in such a hostile environment.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Absolutely.

t3VZ0sXdaa	There's every chance she could be in love with you. It may be a coincidence.<br>  But either way, you have to mention it to her. Ask her if there's anyone she likes or something. Don't accuse her right away, because she will feel uncomfortable and it would probably make her feel awkward.<br>  Wait until you're alone and just try and find out what's really going on first, try asking her casually why she had the piece of paper. Wait until she has admitted to actually liking you before you tell her you don't want to go out with her. Because if you are wrong she will feel insulted that you suggested it, feeling that you only did because of her sexuality.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Sounds like she might.

Either there is something or there isn't, but I have no way of knowing one way or the other.  <br>  <br>  Believing in an afterlife just because it feels reassuring is dishonest.|`|yAvTxh47aa	Funny, my religion tells me to focus on this life, and when loved ones of mine have passed away it is their lives I've focused on, not their afterlives.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why thinking they have an afterlife would be a comfort. The pain is missing them NOW.|`|3RYqo9dJaa	Non-Believers as in not Christian? That is what is generally meant.<br>  <br>  When I was agnostic though, I used to go by the saying, "Everyone dies at some point. It's just the when and why that really counts." Some how that made me cope with it.|`|MYrwcjDSaa	I have accepted that someday I will die and cease to exist and that's what makes life good, that death ends it. We're like a spark in the night sky.. a bright flash and then no more. It's still a beautiful life!|`|Ne9rXERpaa	In my mother's case, I break out the champagne -- she resented us kids and felt that we were somehow holding her back in life, and never missed an opportuntity to take it out on us for it...|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	I miss them.<br>  I think of them and their lives.<br>  I think of the good times we had together.<br>  And I do all of that as often as I can.<br>  <br>  And, I will always remember them.|`|V610w8EXaa	My mom died a few days after my 10th birthday.  I was told by some well-meaning doofii that "the Man upstairs" came to "take her home" ... that's when I really started investigating the concept of God (thru books, philosophy, religion, and anthropology classes in college, life experience) and eventually realized it's all just a myth.<br>  <br>  It's more comforting to remember the good times, and memories (thru photos, etc) than to concoct some fantasy realm where she "lives for eternity."  She's DEAD and rotted in a coffin six feet underground, and been there for a quarter of a century.  <br>  <br>  I hardly remember her ... but one of the strongest memories I have is of her, stumbling into our little single-wide trailer after returning from a New Year's party in 1982 ... she was drunk off her azz (I realized later, in retro-spect) but she had the most beautiful smile ...|`|rkhXCiIBaa	I miss them, but it doesn't make me sad to not believe that they still exist. I remember how hard it was to bite my tongue at my grandpa's funeral when everybody started making up stories about what he was doing in heaven at that moment. I know they just wanted to make themselves feel better, the farfetchedness of their communal lie struck me as disrespectful. Wouldn't it have been enough to reflect on the life he led and the way he touched all of us without inventing stories about him whistling while walking down streets of gold?<br>  <br>  So I guess the answer to our question is that I miss them, I try to remember as much as I can about them, and share it with the others who knew them. Since many of my loved ones who died weren't Christian, belief in a Christian heaven and hell would actually be a source of grief for me--in fact when I was a Christian I used to cry myself to sleep at night thinking about all the people who were going to burn in hell. I prefer just missing them :)|`|RSUYs8Mzaa	Generally, grief is not for the one who has died, but those of us who remain. Some people may take comfort that their loved one is in heaven or whatever, but it doesn't change the fact that they're gone. So no, I don't feel bad that they have no afterlife. I do, though, feel the loss of them as an influence in my life.|`|b4c9e2b92e1f026eefef2790f5184d75aa	I feel upset that I didn't take the time to get to know them better and spend more time with them.<br>  <br>  I would hope that they accomplished everything that they wanted in life and its hard for me to know if they did or didn't so I can't comment on that.|`|GGGmoyNeaa	I am more inclined to celebrate the lives of my fallen comrades and kin than dwell morbidly on their deaths or engage in wishful thinking. I have many friends who never fail to offer me support and comfort when needed. No false comfort required from dieties.|`|yu53u5TFaa	Yes, I feel bad. But I'd rather know that they are never coming back then try to fool myself that I will see them again. It's better to tell a child that their friend died then that he moved away and maybe some day they will see him again.|`|1ehmRBruaa	Yes, I would be upset for my loss. She's dead that's it, she lived her life. I don't have to believe in an afterlife to make myself feel better.|`|sw08ARSZaa	No. I won't get upset about her lack of an afterlife. I will be upset that she's gone. I will miss her, but I will grieve and get on with my life like most people do when they lose a loved one.|`|14JVQP9Paa	Life is often upsetting.  Making up lies to believe isn't an appropriate reaction.|`|QvtGNiEbaa	Most people feel upset when a loved one dies, but not everyone believe in life after death. Our lives go on after they die.|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	Of course you get sad at such things. |But eventually you get over it, like kids do all the time. Atheist are just big kids. <br>  :)|`|FfxmE9Toaa	When my father died, I was relieved for him to be out of so many years of pain and confusion.|`|s1zitZMOaa	When my father died I coped with it in the usual way I suppose. I was sad, I was angry, I cried and laughed with my friends and family. I don't feel upset that there is no life after death for him and that I won't ever be reunited with him in some heaven or similar thing because I know that any such thought would be wishful thinking and no different from wishing I could turn back the hands of time and bring him back to life. It's just reality. I miss him but that's the way it is.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	I feel upset for me not for them.  I'm the one missing them - they no longer have any consciousness or sensation or experience to need anything, suffer anything or feel anything .An eternal life would be incredible torment.  Few people have any mental idea what eternity would be like.  Imagine doing ANYTHING for billions upon trillions of years.   The sheer monotony would drive whatever remnant of human consciousness anyone suggests might survive completely insane.  It would be intolerable cruelty to wish that on a departed loved one even if I did consider it plausible for a second it might be real.<br>  <br>  To consider experience after death try to remember what it was like before you were born.  Death is like that.  What upset should that cause a surviving relative or friend when we die?|`|NrzxtivLaa	accept it as part of the natural cycle of life, even though there is no afterlife, the memory of their life, and the lessons they passed on to others remains|`|UWKF7x4faa	The Truth does not always feel as good as fairy tales we construct. <br>  We must cherish loved ones in our memories.|`|URO3gDXcaa	grieve with family and friends and move on.
8QoNSvp6aa	ok time to bring historical fact into the room<br>  im not a racist if you think so **** you<br>  but historically blacks were enslaved by every culture  they came in contact with the egyptians enslaved them at that time blacks were only found in south africa  other arabic cultures did likewise blacks have been enslaved since christ walked the earth long before their journey over here <br>  so if you want to be mad cool but youd better include all the ppl who inslaved you not just americans p.s. i dont  state things out of anger <br>  i speak truth  my family is from spain i didnt enslave anyone so you cant blame me for **** <br>  and p.s all those who were slaves are dead  you shouldnt get freebies because they got beaten  see i get so tired of this stupid issue being argued about it sounds mean but **** you you werent enslaved you werent beaten how do you feel your owed anything?its the freebie syndrom its not racism its facts blacks are the majority of food stamp users public housing users  but since theres affirmative action you should get hired before me <br>  but **** if i got $800 in food stamps and free assistance i wouldnt work either  and these same ppl will say they refuse to work at mcdnlds cuz its beneath them  **** those ppl got cars and apartments  why do you think so many black women date white men ? they want out of poverty its mostly black men who bring down their ppl .strong black women get with white boys who have a job and a car and they know when they get pregnant the first words out his mouth wont be ***** it aint mines!!! the learning curve got lowered in public schools for black men the women learned quick but even at the lowest form of testing black males graded low or retarded thats why they dont do alot of tests they did when i was a kid and that was only the 80S!!!!!! i hear black men talk 24/7 about how they were stolen from mother africa and all that but NONE of them want to go back  cuz they will not get all the free **** they do here! even americas poorest  live better than middle class africa  so please either leave america or shut the **** up unless you went  through slavery personaly the government  will never give you **** so get a job and quit holding your hand out lil bitches...............|`|AA11490975	If their socioeconomic situation can still be explained via slavery's consequences...then probably.

cMZEmpp0aa	Well, it's not usually something parents would want their daughters to do, but as far as I can tell it's because being a geisha would require the girl to move away from her family and, if she starts in her teenage years, would prevent her from going past 9th grade in school (compulsory schooling ends at the end of 9th grade). Plus, geisha can't get married, and since marriage is still considered very important for women in Japan I imagine that would cause stress in some families, particularly in families where the geisha-wannabe daughter was the only daughter or even the only child. Since geisha aren't prostitutes, thoughts about sex probably don't enter the equation.<br>  <br>  So no, I wouldn't call it taboo, it's just not necessarily a path many parents would be thrilled for their daughters to choose. Kind of like...if your parents always wanted you to be a doctor or a lawyer, but you decided to be a ballerina instead.|`|VMY7No0eaa	in this country...yes<br>  Japan no|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Not in Japan.It's still a highly sought after life.|`|AA10067344	No.|`|gJMBiuIdaa	You're dumb Meme|`|7d866ea2a2dff3d3d77ce1b12a4e11c8aa	Not to my knowledge.|`|e2023980e76f8f01d5ba81251c994b7caa	Absolutely not.  Being a geisha is trade that not many take on these days due to the cost of a young lady's training that takes years. Not only that, young ladies have the option of higher education in Japan and no one is ever "sold" to a Geisha house as it was in the past.  <br>  Their time is also very expensive so save up lots of yes if you wish to be entertained by one if you ever go to Japan.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with being a Geisha. They are highly respected and a great part of Japanese culture.
HIMwyeZqaa	The United States is the country who most thinks of itself as the policeman of other nations.  I don't believe China is engaged in any wars lest it be a domestic one in the area of Tibet.  France and a number of other countries are far more into military adventurism with other countries. <br>  I don't understand Chinese well enough to know if it is tough or not.  But the end results is that the United States is the most high handed in domination of other nations.  I would expect that it has little to do with our language.|`|qWu5F1O2aa	I've listened to Mandarin and i dont think it sounds "tough". However, i cant speak for everyone since it may sound tough to some. I dont think language phonetics have anything to do with domination. I'd relate it to a nation's resources, political and military tactics/strength and system that will lead it to dominate other countries, if they chose to do so.|`|GPznIhzMaa	I think the Chinese government is aggressive but I wouldn't make the generalization for all Chinese people. I don't think language is a good indication of level of aggression within a culture. Mandarin sounds soft to my ears. Some other Chinese dialects are much harsher-sounding. But IMO the most guttural language is German.|`|jiMAtaCraa	Well, if the English were soft, they wouldn't have dominated the whole world.|`|OWVXKKLdaa	It can sound harsh... not as much as like German though.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend speaks Cantonese and Mandarin. <br>  I really like hearing him speak it...

GPznIhzMaa	I'm an American-born Chinese and I get similar reactions when I travel abroad, especially in Europe and Asia.

Americans are no different from other groups.<br>  <br>  One difference is ethnocentric people from other nations often don't have the funds to meet people from other nations. So wealthier, educated people from other nations you meet are not judgemental of other cultures, poorer folks from the culture are just as ethnocentric as the Americans. <br>  People of a lower class status in American often have the means/finances/opportunity to travel or go to school with people of other cultures and they bring ethnocentric beliefs with them.<br>  <br>  I assure you many Americans are very respectful.|`|pfke6Jieaa	because ppl really dont know anything. the first answer, most americans i met and my family and friends met WERE really ignorant about the world and did know anything about other cultures and countries nor were they interested. there is no doubt about it. <br>  <br>  i think since the US is the strongest in the world that it has the feeling that there is no need to know about other cultures and other cultures should learn about them if they want to get along with them. thats pathetic.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	Yep.  Us Americans are just a bunch of beer drinking and football watching neanderthals who never go to college or never travel and immerse ourselves in other cultures,  but we just accidentally have more money then everyone else,  invent more things, and travel more then everyone else.  And we are all racist,  yet we have more inter racial marriages then everyone else.|`|7Ohs5ABCaa	Interesting that you in your question use Americans and then target White Americans in your details?  Do you think all Americans are white or when you imagine an American you imagine a white person?  I think that displays a little of your own prejudice.|`|AA11490975	Why do people unethically generalize all white Americans when they complain about white Americans who unethically generalize?|`|sFjYVH7paa	Kind of like the Korean girl that cursed at me for thinking she was Chinese.<br>  <br>  Although, I was actually talking to a Japanese friend of mine, in Japanese, and I had no idea who this random girl was.<br>  <br>  Or the German couple who complained about everything in my restaurant, from the food to the service, while they stole the flatware.  Of course, they shut up real fast when I gave them the dessert menu and aperitif list auf Deustch.<br>  <br>  I am a bad American.  Just like everyone else in the world (Laotians, French, English, Africans, Persians, Moroccans, Chinese), thinks I am.<br>  <br>  Oh well.<br>  <br>  ps.  I have met many people from all over the world because I travel a lot.  Many of them didn't like me before I even opened my mouth.  They were just as ignorant and prejudiced as many of the Americans I know.<br>  <br>  However, a greater number of them were very pleasant and friendly and I welcome them to my home anytime they wish to visit.<br>  <br>  edit:  By your definition, Native Americans are not "Americans" either.  They just got to the continent first.  Of course, it was about 10,000-20,000 years earlier, but they were from the Asian continent.  The current definition of American is any person who lives in and is a citizen of the United States of America.<br>  <br>  That is true whether your family is from France, Italy, Russia, China, England, Kenya, or, if you are like my family, Cherokee.  We are all Americans, we live in America.

Jesus is called the arm of the Lord in other places in the Bible too, we know that Jesus sits at the right hand of God ( Mark 16:19;Luke 22:69; Rom.8:34 ) We can see in the New Testament when this verse was fulfilled: <br>  <br>  John 12:37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:<br>  38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? <br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br>  3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. <br>  <br>  We see how it says the " He ( Jesus ) shall grow up before Him ( The Father ) as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground: " The words " grow up " shows that the Lord would be born, and from a child grow before the Lord. These other verses describe so much about Jesus, His heart, the things that He endured, how He was treated by people.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<br>  5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. <br>  6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br>  <br>  We see the purpose of Christ coming, it was to pay the debt for our sins, He bore our griefs, and carried our sorrows. How much Jesus loves us! He took our place, the punishment that we deserve He took on Himself, He suffered for us, so that we could go free.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.<br>  25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.<br>  <br>  This shows how Jesus would be brought to be put to death, and even though He was oppressed and afflicted He didn't speak, so much so that Pilate marveled. <br>  <br>  Mark 15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.<br>  4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.<br>  5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. <br>  <br>  We can also see from Acts that this scripture is speaking of Jesus:<br>  <br>  Acts 8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?<br>  31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.<br>  32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:<br>  33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.<br>  34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?<br>  35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. <br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.<br>  9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. <br>  <br>  This shows that Jesus would die, " for He was cut off out of the land of the living: " and it was us that He died. By saying, " He made His grave with the wicked, " it was speaking of how He was crucified with the wicked, ( the criminals who had done wrong ) " and with the rich in His death " it was speaking of the tomb that Jesus was laid in. After the Lord's death a rich man that believed in Jesus gave the tomb that he had carved out. <br>  <br>  Matthew 27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:<br>  58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.<br>  59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,<br>  60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.<br>  <br>  That ninth verse not only shows how Jesus was killed among the wicked, and how He was buried in a rich man's tomb, but also that Jesus had done no wrong, or anything worthy of death, " because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. " Jesus was and is perfect, without sin.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.<br>  <br>  We see that it was God's plan for Christ to die for us, it was because God loves us so much and He desires for us to be with Him. In this verse it says, " when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. " by saying, " He shall see " and " He shall prolong His days " we see about the resurrection of Jesus, He was not left dead, but God raised Him up from the dead. If someone died their days could not be prolonged unless they were alive again, and by prolonged that doesn't mean for a short time, Jesus lives for ever! <br>  " And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand " It speaks to me how Jesus Christ reigns, the authority that Christ has.<br>  <br>  Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.<br>  12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.<br>  <br>  Jesus made an offering for our sin, He laid down His own life for us, so that we could have eternal life. This is the only sacrifice for sin that God accepts, nothing else can take our sins away, only the blood of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 9: 28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.<br>  <br>  In the twelfth verse I see more of how the Lord Jesus Christ reigns:<br>  <br>  Philippians 2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<br>  9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:<br>  10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;<br>  11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <br>  <br>  Thank you for asking this question, it has been a blessing to me. <br>  There is still so much more that could be said about this, this is one of my favorite chapters in the Bible. <br>  <br>  with all sincerity in Christ,<br>  andrew|`|ORDjVHY4aa	(1) John 12:38(KJV) – That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he <br>  <br>  spake,Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been <br>  <br>  revealed?<br>  <br>  Romans 10:16(KJV) – But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

Isaiah=Esaias|`|f52d0e0d68fe751ba99b9760222dec30aa	I love that question. This passage is a prophecy about the Lord Jesus Christ in prophetic language, and it was fulfilled in his life, as documented by the four gospels:<br>  <br>  1) "He grew up like a sapling before him, like a shoot from the parched earth; There was in him no stately bearing to make us look at him, nor appearance that would attract us to him."<br>  <br>  This verse speaks of Jesus' natural birth on earth, and his lack of "movie star" looks and appeal (so people wouldn't be attracted to him for non-spiritual reasons)<br>  <br>  2) "He was spurned and avoided by men, a man of suffering, accustomed to infirmity, One of those from whom men hide their faces, spurned, and we held him in no esteem."<br>  <br>  This verse speaks of his rejection by both the Romans and the Majority of Israel, as well as his coming purpose- to suffer for all of mankind. It also refers to how his follows abandoned and rejected him at the hour of his greatest suffering.<br>  <br>  3) Yet it was our infirmities that he bore, our sufferings that he endured, While we thought of him as stricken, as one smitten by God and afflicted."<br>  <br>  This verse speaks of why he came -- to bear the punishment that rightly belonged to all of mankind because of our sin nature, punishment that he didn't deserve because he had no sin. It was indeed God the Father who punished him on behalf of man, as was arranged.<br>  <br>  "But he was pierced for our offenses, crushed for our sins, Upon him was the chastisement that makes us whole, by his stripes we were healed."<br>  <br>  This refers to the details of his crucifixion (piercing by nails) and the benefits of his punishment for us; we received his righteousness as he took our punishment, healing us from the damage of sin by giving us a new spiritual rebirth. The words "by his stripes" refers to his being scourged by the Romans at Golgotha.<br>  <br>  "We had all gone astray like sheep, each following his own way; But the LORD laid upon him the guilt of us all. Though he was harshly treated, he submitted and opened not his mouth; Like a lamb led to the slaughter or a sheep before the shearers, he was silent and opened not his mouth."<br>  <br>  This passage speaks about the condition of man ("each following his own way") and the reason why Jesus came; so Gd could "lay upon him the guilt of us all." It also prophesies that he would not speak up on his own behalf, despite how they would treat him, because this was why he came in the first place.<br>  <br>  "Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away, and who would have thought any more of his destiny? When he was cut off from the land of the living, and smitten for the sin of his people, A grave was assigned him among the wicked and a burial place with evildoers, Though he had done no wrong nor spoken any falsehood."<br>  <br>  This passage refers to his death ("Cut off from the land of the living") his purpose in coming ("smitten for the sin of his people") and how he was buried in a borrowed tomb among sinners, despite his innocence and sinlessness.<br>  <br>  "(But the LORD was pleased to crush him in infirmity.) If he gives his life as an offering for sin, he shall see his descendants in a long life, and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished through him. Because of his affliction he shall see the light in fullness of days; Through his suffering, my servant shall justify many, and their guilt he shall bear. Therefore I will give him his portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoils with the mighty, Because he surrendered himself to death and was counted among the wicked; And he shall take away the sins of many, and win pardon for their offenses."<br>  <br>  This passage refers to the Father's reaction; to be pleased that Jesus did this, and to reward him by restoring his life ("He shall see the light in fulness of days"), to lift him up and give exalt him on high ("I will give him a portion among the great, because he surrendered himself to death...") and the results of his sacrifice ("He shall take away the sins of many, and win pardon for their ofenses."<br>  <br>  This passage could be fulfilled by none other than the Lord Jesus Christ!|`|qT3GrDRDaa	how excellent the first 4 answers! <br>  I am Jewish and these scriptures helped me see that he is the Messiah.<br>   Yeshua means God is Salvation in Hebrew Jesous in Greek Jesus in English.And the fulfillment begins with Adam and Eve, who were told that one would come to crush the evil one, and an animal was slain (blood sacrifice) to cover their sin, which the leaves they had tried didnt do.  Leviticus 17:11 & Genesis 3 (verse 15 about crushing the evil one)  Moses stated that the blood sacrifice atones for sin, "The life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it upon the altar to make atonement/forgiveness for your soul/sin."<br>  <br>  It begins in Chapter 52 :13 the last paragraph<br>  "He shall be exalted and made very high.

It will help you understand the importance and personal meaning of the depth of God's love for us and the willingness of Christ to become the "suffering servant" for the sins of all mankind.<br>  <br>  Let’s begin our study with the first verse of Isaiah 53:<br>  <br>  "Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” <br>  <br>  This verse is a prophecy applied to Christ. In the gospel of John, chapter 12, verses 37-38 it is written:<br>  <br>  "But though He (Jesus) had performed so many signs before them, yet they were not believing in Him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: ‘Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?’ "<br>  <br>  These verses confirm that the apostle John found fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy in Jesus. The Apostle Paul also referred to this prophecy in Romans 10:16:<br>  <br>  "But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias (Isaiah) saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?” (Romans 10:16, KJV)<br>  <br>  The second verse of Isaiah 53 confirms a prophecy found earlier in chapter 11, verse 1:<br>  <br>  "Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.” (Isaiah 11:1)<br>  <br>  The third verse of Isaiah states:<br>  <br>  "He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were [our] faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. "<br>  <br>  The noun "sorrows" in Isaiah 53:3 is Strong's Concordance # 4341, mak'owb, mak-obe and means to feel pain, anguish, affliction. According to Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon when applied to the this passage of Isaiah 53, both physical and mental pain are meant.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:3 confirms a previous prophecy in Isaiah 49:7:<br>  <br>  "Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel and its Holy One, to the despised One, to the One abhorred by the nation, to the Servant of rulers, kings will see and arise, princes will also bow down, because of the Lord who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen You." <br>  <br>  A New Testament fulfillment of Isaiah 53:3 can be found in Luke 18:31-33:<br>  <br>  "Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished. For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, and mistreated and spit upon, and after they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and the third day He will rise again." <br>  <br>  These verses affirm that Jesus Himself knew He was and is the Messiah.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:4 finds fulfillment in the New Testament in Matthew 8:17:<br>  <br>  "This was to fulfill what was spoken though Isaiah the prophet: 'He Himself took our infirmities and carried away our diseases.'" <br>  <br>  Since Isaiah 53:5 contains the core meaning of this chapter it has been divided into four pieces. The entire verse reads:<br>  <br>  "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." (Isaiah 53:5, KJV).<br>  <br>  The Amplified Bible renders this verse:<br>  <br>  "But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our guilt and iniquities; the chastisement [needful to obtain] peace and well-being for us was upon Him, and with the stripes [that wounded] Him we are healed and made whole."<br>  <br>  "But he was wounded for our transgressions"<br>  <br>  The word transgressions is Strong's Concordance # 6588, pesha peh'-shah; a revolt (national, moral or religious)-- rebellion, sin, transgression, trespass.

tuULGJS6aa	I just had e-mail #2 from a clown who says that Matthew and Luke's lineages of David to Joseph aren't contradictory, because one is Mary's lineage. Such a man can't even read. They can drive you nuts harping on such silly excuses for the many contradictions in the Bible. Both say they are for joseph, and Mary is mentioned as his wife, but how anyone can twist the verse to try to say that it's Mary's descent boggles the mind.|`|4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	Looks like someone spends more time on the internet than actually reading their Bible.  Do you  in any way think you are the first person to ask this?  I can get on a search engine and find just as many sites that support Biblical facts in direct contradiction to what you've found, just type in "responses to Biblical contradictions" if you don't believe me.  The Bible has stood up to those arguments since Guttenburg.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	One of the main scriptures in the bible is in Hebrews 11:6<br>  "Without faith it is impossible to please God"<br>  Everything in our relationship with God is based on faith, we do not worry ourselves with small stuff, when there are witness accounts today in accidents, there you will always find discrepancies , small variations because one person might not perceive what they saw in the same way that another person does...especially when people were witnessing miracles, there is a lot of excitement, even today....<br>  God says that if you love Him, then you believe what He says...so you choose ...|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	if you would study, using context, word definition (since the OT and NT were written in 2 difffernet languages), history, and points of view, you would know that there are no contradictions in the bible.|`|JL4kAD8Yaa	Exactly!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  But the bottom line IS this . . . <br>  The Bible was written by Man, who isn't a God, and who is liable to make mistakes.<br>  The very proof that it wasn't inspired by ANY "perfect" God!|`|kNCCrjOeaa	because it wasn't written by god no matter what christians say. there is historical proof that it was written by people at a much later date than people believe.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	They just ignore them or try to reconcile those contradictions (with little success)|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Generally, society doesn't differentiate between "apparent" or "mere" contradictions and actual contradictions. <br>  <br>  One can find what appears to be a contradiction, but if there is an explanation for it, then it is not a TRUE contradiction. <br>  <br>  The Police and Courts deal with this sort of "apparent contradiction" all the time. <br>  <br>  Suppose 2 eyewitnesses.  1 testifies that the suspect was with a male and a female.  The other eye witness says they saw the suspect with only a male.  Are the 2 contradicting themselves?  -- In a way they do,  they create "apparent contradictions"   However,  on further clarification,  it may be that the 2 eye witnesses saw the suspect at 2 different times.  OR that something blocked the view of the female, so the 2nd eye witness could only see the male who was with the suspect.  It could also be that the 2nd eye witness only reported what was important as they knew the female had nothnig to do with the crime. <br>  <br>  You see,  the court does not throw out evidence so long as their is a way to reconcile the differences. <br>  <br>  And this is largely how the bible works.  IF there is a way to reconcile what appears to contradict on the surface, then they aren't really errors.<br>  <br>  If you think about it,  there have been theologians and scholars studying the bible for over a thousand years. Also many skeptical scholars have ALSO taken a crack at it.  There are explanations for all of the contradictions which people take as errors in the bible. <br>  <br>  Many of them come down to an incomplete understanding of the culture, figures of speech/idioms, etc. when those books were written.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also,  because the bible is a compiled text and were not written together,  special care must be made to not pit verses against each other but to read them as complementary or 'additive"  so if 1 verse says to wife submit to your husband,  yet another says that husbands must treat their wives as special or always take their advice,  then both are true and the 2 are roughly equal.  Again, if 1 verse says for a slave to respect its master, but tells masters to treat their slaves like sons, then AGAIN, the 2 verses mean that the 2 are roughly equal.<br>  <br>  ______________________<br>  <br>  Lastly, your note about not taking the minister's word for it, because they all have their own opinion, does cause an issue IF you follow the "sole scriptura" or "bible alone" doctrine that every person should interpret the bible on their own, and NOT follow the interpretation of any man.. then YES you are correct. -- This has led Protestants (Non-Catholic christians) to splinter off into tens of thousands of separate denominations/churches. <br>  <br>  However,  if you take a more centralized Catholic philosophy on bible interpretation, then you'd see that we are free to interpret on our own, so long as that interpretation is consistent with our denominations view of things.  That our denomination (in this case catholic) creates a "framework" in which we are free to roam and interpret things.  So long as our interpretations are in line with this framework or within certain boundaries..we are OK.  When our interpretation conflicts or is outside of this boundary, THEN we have cause for concern... we are obviously not interpreting things correctly. <br>  <br>  A correct interpretation is ALSO in total consistency with that of the very early Christians, the christians from the 1-4th centuries, BEFORE the bible even existed.  These first christians in essence are the "founding fathers" of Christianity.  They learned directly from the Apostles or from those who learned from the Apostles, because no bible existed to teach them.  Therefore, any interpretation of the bible should not contradict the documentation we have from THEM.  It is more likely that WE,  nearly 2,000 years later, have things wrong then THEM, who lived in the centuries immediately following Jesus himself. <br>  <br>  So our authority can come ONLY from a link to the original apostles and what they taught. We can only know we are interpreting scripture in conjunction with their bliefs by researching what the very early christians believed and ensuring that ALL of it is consistent.|`|78VY1OiHaa	Only the moronic Fundies believe that the Bible is infallible.

I mean if the author couldn't be bothered to count the legs on the insects he claims to have made, how am I supposed to trust his other claims?

It's too easy to get tripped up in the minutiae and miss the truths; it's too easy miss the forest for the trees. <br>  <br>  The Bible is about profound truths. It was written by different authors inspirited by the Holy Spirit, at different historical and cultural times, for different people and using different genres (histories, poems, allegories, parables, sayings, etc.). <br>  <br>  The Bible is infallible at the level of the truths it intends to communicate, not necessarily at the level of surface level minutiae.

Dustin Lance Black's acceptance speech showed a similar perpetuation of this stereotype, and I suspect it will set back the LGBT movement more than aid it.<br>  <br>  People like Cowam and Black need to recognize that fighting intolerance and hatred with more intolerance and hatred makes them no better than their opponents.|`|qbb9YiRsaa	he's a disgusting individual that should not be allowed into the Senate due to his lack of intelligence...of course, i have to say...what do you expect from Utah?

The deep things of the Word will never be understood by a secular mind, no matter how brilliant. Unless one honestly seeks an experience with God, he cannot understand the things of God. The Holy Spirit, who explains the Bible (John 16:13; 14:26), is not understood by the carnal, secular mind. On the other hand, the humble, even uneducated Christian who studies the Bible receives amazing understanding from the Holy Spirit (Matthew 11:25; 1 Corinthians 2:9, 10).<br>  <br>  We do a lot of critical analysis when we decided to follow God.. Take some time, dear one, to do your research before asking such a question. Most of the cities mentioned in the Bible have been either excavated and found, or are still inhabited. The evidence, that he has left, would stand in any court of the law.. You can NOT say the same of your evidence.. How many eye witness accounts do you need? How many miracles do you need? The Bible has been proven to be historically accurate as well as archaeologically accurate.. ((these peoples still inhabit the lands of the bible.. This is their history)) They do and did keep records. they have genealogies, tax records, Death records, criminal records, census records, Land records and etc.. There are over 600 writings regarding Jesus that have nothing to do with religion.. Check into Josephus to start with. google it.. <br>  <br>  We do not deny evolution, All things evolve. We deny Evolving into a whole new species, from another species.. The differences between the simian and human is significant.<br>  <br>  1- Evolution is a theory. Thus : THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION. Here is the definition of Theory ..<br>  <br>  1 - Abstract thought : speculation.<br>  2 - A hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation.<br>  3 - An unproved assumption : conjecture.<br>  <br>  You (they) present the theory of evolution as: FACT..<br>  <br>  There is NO ( well, hardly any) evidence that stands up to real scrutiny, or at least nothing tangible to make me think otherwise.. The problem, I think, (in my humble opinion) stems from the fact that folks are *assuming* that 6000 years ago God created everything. When in fact the bible does not say what length of time passed between the creation of the world and when it was actually inhabited by the human race..<br>  <br>  "He that is: OF God, hears God's Words; you therefore hear them not because, you are not of God". - Jesus ...(Jn.8:47)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Peace and God bless from Texas <><|`|AA11942055	Why would it be difficult to believe that God, who created the universe can cause a virgin to be with child, since this is how he chose to come to earth?  <br>  <br>  We cannot fathom with our mortal minds what He wants us to do.  If we accept His guidance, He gives us His Holy Spirit to help us.<br>  <br>  A lot of things about Jesus were predicted *thousands* of years before his birth, in the New Testament.  Jesus fulfilled all of those prophecies.  Horus was more than likely based on those prophecies, rather than the life of Jesus being based on stories about Horus, and Horus did not fulfill the prophecies about the Messiah described in the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  Demons flee in the name of Jesus Christ.

The stories of Horus and Jesus bear only a superficial resemblance.  Look at the original Horus in the book of the dead, not at some anti-theistic websites that spin it.  We can only know God's mind if He tells us what He wants-- Jesus is the supreme and final revelation of God's will and nature.  The virgin birth is a miracle.  Miracles are by definition unexplainable.  Otherwise they wouldn't be miracles.  The resurrection of Jesus makes Christianity true.<br>  <br>  peace

Show some evidence.<br>  <br>  Cancer isn't incurable, by the way -- if you think that, no wonder you believe in miracles!  It's curable, it's survivable, it can go into recession all on its own with no medication...and it can also kill, come back after being in recession, and be very bad.  Cancer survival rates are based on statistics gathered from past results.  If you get pancreatic cancer and it's discovered within a couple of months of the first cancerous cells forming, the survival rate is about 1 out of 8.  If it's not discovered for 6 months or so, the survival rate goes way down to 1 out of 50.  <br>  Breast cancer, if detected early, has a much higher survival rate.  So does skin cancer (about 55 out of 100 if detected early).  That doesn't make those 55 people (or the 1 out of 8 pancreatic cancer sufferers who survive) *miracles* -- it's just the natural variability of people and cancers.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes doctors will tell people with very low odds that "there's little hope" or something similar.  Then if they survive, even the doctors will say it's a "miracle."  Even they forget that god or no god, prayer or no prayer, 1 out of every 8 is going to survive anyway...it's just simple statistics.<br>  <br>  A little education would go a long way towards helping you understand...<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|AA12346187	no  I do  not  I recovered  from a bad accident and  brain damage  despite what teh dr  thought.|`|AA11346514	I suggest that you don't understand the nature of a "miracle."  I have been clear of any cancer for almost 9 years.  In April of 2000 I was diagnosed with "stage 2" colon cancer.  The cancer had penetrated the wall of the colon at the closest point to the urinary bladder and penetrated the bladder.  My early diagnostic symptom was that I passed air through my penis.  I had two surgeons, a general surgeon for my colon and a urological surgeon for my bladder.  Where is the miracle here?  A doctor who recognized that something is weird when a man passes gas the way that I did.  A urologist that knew that only a couple of things could cause that to happen and one was cancer.  An endoscopy specialist that identified the cancer.  Two surgeons who knew what to do what they found.  An oncologist that knew how to follow up and a radiologist that could treat the area without killing me.  Each of these was a miracle of God and He has kept me cancer free for all this time.  Is that enough?  My granddaughter was diagnosed with lymphoma.  She was treated and is now cancer free.  My son had brain cancer 18 months ago.  He had surgery and chemotherapy.  He is surviving and healthy and his scans are clean.  I give all praise to God and surely I thank the doctors involved.

T1beLIQqaa	The West Bank and Gaza strips ARE the Palestinians's land.Even Israel acknowledged this, ceding the land back to them in 2005. The land Israel is on now  was also theirs, but the Israelis stole(no enumeration) this from the Palestinians in 1948 by KILLING and threatening to KILL Palestinians unless they left.The British mandated the Jews should have half the Palestinians's  land. The Palestininians had a constant presence there and owned the land while the Jews were nomadic, having no land until stealing it from the Palestinians.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what some Jews would have people believe, no where in the Bible, does it say the Jews were GIVEN ownership of the "promised land"-only to reside there, as some already had.The promise that is the basis of the term "promised land" is contained in Genesis 15:18-21 of the Hebrew Bible:<br>  "On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abrham and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates - the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites." <br>  <br>  The verse is said to describe what are known as "Borders of the Land" (Gevulot Ha-aretz). In Jewish tradition these borders define the maximum extent of the land promised to the descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac(2nd born-the Jewish lineage and Ishmael the 1st born and the Arab lineage) and grandson Jacob.Even according to Jewish customs, the oldest son, which is Ishmael, is entitled to the father's inheritance, but because Sarah despised Ishmael, she wanted Isaac to get the inheritance and had Abraham exhile Ishmael. Neither is Ishmael illegitimate but the legal son of his SECOND wife Hagar-Genesis 16: "And Sarah Abraham's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abraham had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abraham to be his WIFE(my emphasis).Incidentally, this is Jewish Law-Hagar was NOT looked upon as a concubine, but as a second wife.<br>  <br>  The promise is made to Abraham and the descendants of his son Isaac, and Isaac's son Jacob, Abraham's grandson as they are all given promise that their descendants will be given a territory from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates river.No where does it say the Israelis/Jews OWNED the land, nor were they to take it from, and, kill the Palestinians. The Israelis/Jews were given a land ONLY to reside in as many Jews already had among the Palestinians.God clearly states whom the land belongs to-"the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites." Of all these people, only the Palestinians whom are considered Canaanites, are still around. Except for Iran and Israel, Arabs own all of what was Canaan.Now can ANYONE truly believe God said the Jews were to kill all the Arabs and steal ownership of the land? I don't think so unless you were insane.There was a man whom thought the same about the Jews living among them. His name, Adolph Hitler. Now, by the very same reasoning, the Jews feel it is OK to do what Adolph Hitler did to them.Next step , the Nazi Jewish Gas chambers-many Jews feel all the Arabs should be exterminated so they can have all of the so-called "promised land".Why did they stop with Israel-because they new they would have to cause an Arab Holocaust. Sound familiar. Hitler had the Jews were a special mark. Now the Israelis want the Arabs to pledge an allegiance to Israel-like that will change anything.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine what Americans would have done, had the British said OK, now you have to give half your land to some one else - say Russia. Now say the US did not have a government strong enough to protect Americans-I am willing to bet , Americans would not give up without a fight-same with the Palestinians. They are now willing to die to protect their families and property-as  would most  Americans.<br>  <br>  Are the Palestinians occupying Israel, building Arab only settlements and buffer zones, killing innocent Israelis with tanks, machine guns, and phosphorous bombs(slow, agonizing burning to death), bulldozing, and, stealing Israeli homes(no enumeration) homes, killing, raping, and brutalizing, Jewish owners and women, cutting off food, water, medicine, jobs, and power-why those barbaric Israelis are lobbing missles in Southern Palestine-they have killed 5 times more Israelies than Arabs since keeping Plaestine in 1948, after turning back the British mandate to give half their land to the Jews. <br>  <br>  Now do you see what it looks like when the names are changed-can you really sympathsize with the Israeli occupiers or the Palestininians, whom is acting barbarically here. I do not see the Palestinians doing the above, do you? Whom could/ would?|`|V3uY8Cyzaa	I think all they need to do is give money to the poor to construct their life to be better sending them away is not helping the problem is just avoiding it.Another thing they should do is come up with a resolution for the war which is mean-less .All is doing is getting people to want to blow them self up to protect their own,and country .Innocent people are dying and getting hurt.for something can be easly fix.Is not easy to give up something you want but at the end of the day is not worse it .When you see those children dead in the street and the corner.|`|5f63dadbbe9931a964419168c9443efdaa	wot r u talking about? i think Palestinians chicks are hot! ur making urself depress with all this world problems.|`|AA12041870	If the Israeli people would give them their land back, they would have a place to go.

Palestinians are living terribly, I dislike the Zionist goverments with all my heart. I see members of the Ummah go through so much in this modern time. I love Britain so much but they made a stupid decision by giving Palestinian land to Israel. Israelis soldiers are evil. If you see how they kill, torture and rape our people then you'd understand. They even shot a little school girl because they thought she was carrying a bomb. Sick.<br>  <br>  America doesnt see anything wrong with Israel, you know why? Because they're the ones that stole American land from the Natives. So why would they care?<br>  <br>  They only way we can gain peace is by giving the land back to its rightful owners i.e. Palestinians

Z4avhg3eaa	More than anything else, this story always struck me as indicating that early Christians were communists.<br>  <br>  The cult murder angle never occurred to me.|`|AA11987172	Sounds like a cult-mentality, the whole sharing all of their money business...|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	Not really.  It's just another "oh God is so big" story.   Remember the context here is after a healing and preaching session the group of believers pool their resources in truly communistic fashion (there's even a bit in the preceding chapter that is very Marx-like in saying how).  The ones who have property - Barnabas is named IIRC - sell it to share with the others.<br>  <br>  Ananais decides to keep back some of his share, but of course the apostles get that big flash of divine "hey bullshit, pal!" and just like anybody else who pisses off God in even trivial ways there ain't much leniency and only one penalty which is immediate zappage.  The chance of it being in any way true is remote, and if so is limited only to one apostle or another finding out he was stiffed and getting pissed enough about it to pretend they were zapped when he told the story to whoever wrote it down.|`|JL4kAD8Yaa	That story is a gem!  " . . . don't fork it over . . . lose you life!"<br>  <br>  You know, MONEY (in the Bible) was always confusing to me growing up; this seeming NEED for it, and for religious works in general - this recurring preoccupation . . . how much you should give, when is the right time to give, how you should spend your money, is this a good enough gift . . . WHY?<br>  <br>  What church should ever have a money problem, with God being the CEO?<br>  <br>  You can create a Universe, but you constantly have cash flow problems in your corporation . . . does that make any sense!?<br>  <br>  God not taking care of his churches financially falls under the same category as fortune tellers not winning the lottery constantly - - - the category called "sounds like malarkey"!|`|rkhXCiIBaa	I lean towards cautionary fable myself, but if it actually happened, it sounds a lot like the large number of medieval widows with valuable land who were executed for witchcraft, conveniently leaving their land in the hands of the local authorities.|`|NWopkX4baa	Sounds like Peter killed them.

I lean towards the lie.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	they should have gave up all the money if they said they were. <br>  <br>  Don't say you'll give if you wont. :)|`|WX1b747Iaa	And they kept the money too, typical money grubbing evangelicals.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	I buy that the apostles were religious frauds shaking down the believers during a time when the Romans paid little attention to dead Jews showing up here and there. They murdered Ananias for holding out on them, called his wife in and murdered her, leaving them to lay claim to everything, then circulated the story that god had struck both dead for holding out on the apostles, which you can be sure no one  did after that.
a7Zu52jFaa	Tell her nicely you cannot talk because you're busy.<br>  Tell her "I'll be right back" and then walk to the other side of the class and talk to someone else.<br>  If you have to sit next to her, ask your teacher to be moved. Make sure to explain to your teacher what the problem is. Do NOT go about telling your teacher "Ugh! So and so annoys me so much. I don't like her!" More along the lines of "When I am around her, she talks to me so often I cannot concentrate on my studies."<br>  <br>  If she just doesn't get it, very, very nicely tell her you are uninterested and please leave you alone.|`|R1zUIh7taa	Just say to her that you really need to pay attention in class, and you would just be very upset if any of your grades slipped because she was busy talking to you!
WU3VTYbgaa	What is meant by the word “heavens” in this case? The term sometimes applies to the spiritual dwelling place of God and his angelic sons. (Matthew 6:9; 18:10) “Heavens” may also denote the physical universe. (Deuteronomy 4:19) And the Bible uses this term to refer to earth’s immediate atmosphere, where birds fly and winds blow.—Psalm 78:26; Matthew 6:26.<br>    To which of these heavens did the prophet Elijah ascend? Evidently, he was transferred through earth’s atmosphere and placed on a different part of the globe. Elijah was still on earth years later, for he wrote a letter to King Jehoram of Judah. (2 Chronicles 21:1, 12-15) That Elijah did not ascend to the spiritual abode of Jehovah God was later confirmed by Jesus Christ, who declared: “No man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man,” that is, Jesus himself. (John 3:13) The way to heavenly life was first opened up to imperfect humans after the death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.—John 14:2, 3; Hebrews 9:24; 10:19, 20.|`|sWvbwfLPaa	God kept Elijah for a special task:<br>  <br>  Mal 4:5  Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of Jehovah. <br>  Mal 4:6  And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers, that I not come and strike the earth with utter destruction. <br>  <br>  Before the second coming of Jesus (on the Day of the Lord), Elijah will be sent to teach Israel. The Jews remember this in their Passover dinner - an extra cup on the table symbolizes Elijah.<br>  <br>  I believe Elijah is one of the two witnesses in Revelation:<br>  <br>  Rev 11:3  And I will give power to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. <br>  <br>  These 2 witnesses appear on earth right before Jesus' second coming.|`|AA10988107	Elijah went up into the heavens as the birds or in modern times,<br>  the helicopter does, in the second year of king Jehoram, in God's chariot, to be delivered out of danger to a safe place to write, and<br>  Elisha was out in the field now to face danger, a gang or mob yell<br>  at him, "go up old bald head," a she bear brings and end to the<br>  gang right away, but in the sixth year of king Jehoram he gets a<br>  letter from Elijah, he has two more years to be king and he will<br>  die for all the crimes he has commited, 2Chr.21:5,6,12-18, it<br>  does not tell when Elijah dies, but it does tell when Elisha dies,<br>  2Ki.13:20,21, it is evident if the one was going to go to heaven,<br>  then the other would also, no one qualifies to go to heaven until<br>  after Pentecost, but after John 3:13-15, it will be a long time till<br>  those that are to be raised up, Rom.16:20, are raised up, there<br>  is prophecy time after Judah kings end, Messiah comes, he is<br>  cut off, he ascends to God's right hand to wait until heavens is<br>  cleansed at Rev.12:7-12, then a place is prepared, Rom.16:20,<br>  as the apostles expect to wait, Acts 2:27-35, for those that<br>  Jesus ask for in prayer, John 17:1-26, he told them, John 6,39,40,<br>  44, 14:3, a place is prepared for those to be raise up to be with<br>  Jesus at the last day. All scriptures read that way, Mark 13:27,<br>  Michael at Rev.12:7-12, Dan.12:1-9, is in the time of the end to<br>  give Satan his short time down, Michael is there to the last,<br>  1Thes.4:15-17. 1Cor.15:22-28,51-53, the firstfruits are first so<br>  at Rev.20:1-6, the firstfruits as first resurrected are with Jesus.|`|3mDvjCa8aa	I love pairing 2 King 2:11 with:<br>  <br>  John 3:13<br>  "No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, ... the Son of Man."<br>  <br>  Of course...I'm pulling these verses "out of context", aren't I?
YVj3EqCgaa	There's a really simple test you can do at home. <br>  <br>  Get some vinegar, get some baking soda. Then make a big clay volcano.

It just IS.|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	Wow -- your son is what he is -- there are no tests that you can use, and your question is, you realize, pathetic.  You will allow what your son is to effect how you feel?

I hate singing, in fact, musicals make me want to stick my dick in a blender. Ohh, and no you can't take your son to a doctor to get him checked out, however you may want to go to one and find out if you have down syndrome. What does eye color have to do with sexual orientation? Second thought, scratch the doctor appointment, its not necessary. I can answer the question for you. Yes, you are indeed, retarded. Ohh, and muscle tone also has nothing to do with sexual orientation you ******* moron. Keep playing on tired sexual stereotypes you dumb ****. I can promise you that I know plenty of gay men who have played sports all throughout high school and college, and just because your son wants to sing doesn't make him gay. Why don't you stop worrying about your son's sexual orientation, and be a good father?You're an ignorant prick.  Go ahead and take him to the doctor, regardless of sexual orientation,he's going to hate you after you ask the doctor to run tests on him to see if he's gay.|`|hbvIZPrQaa	Sir, I know that you may just be worried and curious but this is not something that a doctor can answer for you.  Only your son can.  Not all gays have the same characteristics and not all of the characteristics you mentioned are equated with gays.  I think you should just sit him down and talk to him.  Ask him in casual convo about girls and what he thinks about them and take it from there.  Please be sure not insult your son in the process b/c he is still your flesh and blood whether you want him to be gay or not.|`|3L36pWovaa	I am sorry to hear that your son might have the gay.  I don't know if there is a definitive test for the gay.  Some gays go on to live (seemingly) normal lives, while others cannot seem to stop being flamboyant.  <br>  <br>  My guess is that only time will tell.  In the mean time, surround him with manly things and pray for the best.|`|lqSlPnDAaa	This was just such a ridiculous question, I couldn't stop myself from answering. In all honesty, if you're ignorant enough to want to get your son tested for homosexuality, then you obviously <br>      A) Are completely homophobic<br>      B) Don't love your son<br>      C) Are just plain stupid<br>  Go join the Westboro Baptist Church, will you?|`|587363d914645ecc4fec47212660ba45aa	There is no test to see if a person is gay.. and if he's a tenor when sings that is ok, and you never did say the age of your son.

There isn't a defined test (technically the Kinsey scale) that can measure/tell if you are gay. A tenor voice is a type of voice in singing. It's a male voice that can hit high notes, what did you come out from under a rock or something? Like how goddamn stupid are you?|`|TMimGe3faa	You cant really test if hes gay or not, alot of guys that i know are like that and they arent gay. Besides if he wantted you to know he would tell you|`|Qphs55dZaa	HAHAHA!!! Are you serious? Hopefully not.<br>  <br>  No there's not any kind of medical test. You could ask, I guess, but he might lie.
839be5UKaa	Thats cant be translated diectly into Irish. There no direct way in Irish to say "no...."<br>  <br>  The nearest translation would be,<br>  <br>  no harm = níl aon dochar ann<br>  (literally, there isnt any harm there)<br>  <br>  no foul = níl aon feall ann<br>  (there isnt any fould there)<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  no harm = gan dochar<br>  (literally, without harm)<br>  <br>  no foul = gan feall<br>  (without foul)

UIKirwB4aa	Knowingly having a STD and still having sex without telling your partner is one of the most irresponsible and selfish things one can do. Not to mention illegal.  I would ride your mother about fessing up, it is her responsibility to tell him. Maybe bringing her literature about the lasting effects and severity of her VD will help persuade her to tell him. Also make sure to tell her that you don't think that what she is doing is right. Because, if you tell her boyfriend, you can pretty much insure that their relationship will be over and you will face later resentment from your mother.  Good luck.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Bad trolling son,l and shame on you for saying BS like that about your mother.|`|VMY7No0eaa	NO that is up to her NOT YOU!|`|rThIVk2maa	.............eh.

Fish think their humans are god anyway so stand in front of their tank and say "Bad fish, baaaad fish" That will teach them.|`|1f2movZZaa	First of all, this is probably normal animal behavior. Most likely its not even about sexuality. This could be a pecking-order (dominance in a pack) behavior. Dogs do it too, if you look around. I have two male beagles, and even though they are both neutered, Charlie, the older one, will still hump our younger dog, Gunther. It's not about passion or pleasure; its about showing Gunther that he's the boss. Almost all animals do it, and it has nothing to do with sexuality.<br>  <br>  Don't euthanize your fish over natural animal behavior, I would consider that cruelty, and a sin. You aren't God, and therefore you shouldn't end the life of one of your fish just because you think it is imperfect. We are all flawed, and it's against Christian morals to judge and persecute others. It's the old saying, "Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house."<br>  <br>  If you really cannot tolerate watching this pack-oriented behavior in your fish, you should try to find someone else who can give them a good home.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	yeea separate them and buy a few female fish|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no he isnt....dont use filth here.....language needs adjustment|`|xP1xmSeaaa	You must have exposed him to homosexual propaganda.<br>  Is he a colorful fish like a beta or a good clean christian one like a goldfish.|`|NWopkX4baa	Buy a crucifix you can put into the water, that way, they'll be too ashamed to continue their sin in front of the Lord.|`|ysVNRN6Laa	MOCKERER!!!|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	Um...you've never actually studied the life-cycle of a fish, have you?|`|AA12205301	There is no such thing in the animal kingdom as "gay".  some species mate with either sex.|`|CMms2lGoaa	They<br>  Are <br>  Playing <br>  With<br>  Each<br>  Other.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	We're Queer, We're Here!!

Sexual orientation cannot really be answered by anybody else but yourself, literally because nobody else is in your shoes.

Still had some feelings for guys though, so I considered myself bi-sexual. <br>  Now I have no sexual or emotional attachment to men at all... I feel completely attracted to women.

bnjjeBLYaa	My priest told a similar story of a man who saw a flock of birds outside his window and saw they were freezing in the cold December weather. He opened the door to the barn in hopes that they would fly in and be warm from the wind, but he could not communicate to them that the barn was safe and warm. <br>  <br>  This happened close to Christmas, and the nonreligious man described here suddenly realized how God might feel. God knew how to help His people, here the birds, be safe and warm from the winter night, but He could not communicate His message because He is not one of the birds. So He sent Jesus to lead humanity to a better, safer life. <br>  <br>  Touching story, especially since the father then felt even more connected to his loving and religious family.|`|AA11946554	I just saw on the news this morning how some woman tried to beat her child and  drown him.

963d63f6d3d4458368e99dbfe9b34914aa	haha, don't do the first advice... that would be socially awkward.<br>  <br>  TALK TO HIM, think of something you could ask him that you KNOW would get him talking, or lead to a conversation... then read him based on what type of reaction you get. If he's nervous, that's good, if he's interested, that even better. Be confident though, because that's a turn on.<br>  <br>  and GOOD CALL on not trusting what people say. I don't even care if they're your friends, most straight people have NO CLUE, and just say whatever they want to, not meaning to cause trouble. If he doesn't tell you he's gay, it's best to assume he's not until you hear from him otherwise. You'll save yourself a lot of trouble this way.|`|9HeQd7cNaa	first off, ask some of his friends about the situation. also, ask him why he was staring at you and if he tries to deny it, tell him that you saw him and his face was pink and if he starts to act shy or embarrassed, say something cheesy like you won't judge him and he will probably admit it. that is how my ex-girlfriend found out i liked her!

But please keep in mind of how for so many years there were no other children of other races in any kind of publication.  Now it's all Colors of Beneton these days which is a beautiful thing to see children of all colors together.  I remember getting a Brownies brochure when I was a little girl and there wasn't one black girl in the whole thing.  Based on that I thought I couldn't be a Brownie and it broke my heart.<br>  Remember, only when you notice these kinds of things will your child pick up on them.  If you don't notice them, neither will your little one.  the less one thinks about race the more it won't mean anything.  <br>  <br>  Now wouldn't that be nice?  I think so :)<br>  <br>  As far as the missing events on the calander I'm sure they're just trying to be PC.

a4CJYsH9aa	I've always heard people make comments about hell: "Hell is on earth, I live it everyday".  Hell is going to be hot!,  Hell is where we go to when we die if Jesus is not in our heart.  No such thing as hell !   Hell is not a literal place...everyone has their own beliefs, thoughts and comments about hell.<br>  Since you state you don't want to hear scripture, (copout), I will give you a synopsis of a true story, by a person who died and entered into hell's domain, not once but twice..the first time, a patient in the Dr. office, in the middle of a stress test, hooked up to a treadmill, fell dead.<br>  At the remembrance of the incident the Dr. (professing Atheist) tells the story, the patient fell dead and for several minutes, he came back, yelling help me Dr. I've been to hell and I'm going back, pray for me.<br>  He was gone again, as the Dr. watched, again the patient came back, saying Dr. pray for me. The Dr. replied, don't ask me to pray for you I'm an Atheist, I don't even believe God exist. The patient screamed again, pray for me. The Dr. ( to appease the patient) took him by the hand, and said "God if you are real, help this man".<br>  Suddenly, the man began to calm and respond to treatment.<br>       As I sat in a packed room taking in this account, told by the Dr. I was amazed to hear the ending. The Atheist Dr. continued by saying, because he had seen with his own eyes, a patient on his treadmill, in the middle of a stress test, fall dead, not once but twice and came back, after the Dr. had knealt down beside the man, saying a prayer to a God, he did not believe in, and saw the return of a dead man to life again, and living to tell his experience while he( the patient) traveled down a dark tunnel, unprepared for Heaven.<br>  The patient told his story to the Dr. of what he experienced, there was no light, no air and not another soul anywhere around.  The sickening stench filled his nose with the smell of sulfur, and a smell of flesh burning, demon spirits tormenting him in biting and pulling at his body in every direction, also, the lonliness was intolerable, the worse thing of all was the lonliness, no presence or sense of God anywhere.<br>     So according to this testimony of a person who died two times and came back, because of a "Prayer" by an unbelieving Atheist who started his prayer, God if you exist, help this man, God heard and brought the patient back.<br>  By the way, the Atheist Dr. "got saved", he says, if God heard an Atheist Dr. and did what I asked, He has to be real!<br>  The patient is still alive today and is the pastor of a church in Ohio and the Brother Dr. belongs to the chlurch and tells their story to all who will listen..<br>  Personally I don't believe God prepared hell for people, but for Lucifer and the fallen angels, that were tossed out of Heaven.<br>  But because man is a free agent who is allowed to make his own decisions, by choice, and rejects the Ultimate sacrifice(Jesus) that<br>  God sent to Earth in the flesh, by way of the Virgin Birth by Mary, the Mother of Christ, the Son of the Living God, shedding of His blood and dying for man's sins, taking man's sins upon his own body,and making a way back to the Fathers's house,  Man must give account for his<br>  rejection of the Son of God, and this rejection warrants Eternal punishment, void of God's presence, Hell an everlasting place of punishment for the rejection of God' s only begotten Son.<br>  God doesn't put us in hell, our own choices put us there...the Word of God says,"CHOOSE LIFE".....hell is an unquenchable fire and brimstone, the "rich man" died and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being tormented in flames, asking if he could go and warn his brothers not to come to this place,,,that should be a warning to us on earth, there is an afterlife we must all face, we choose heaven or hell.....<br>  <br>  Love n  Jesus<br>  Sister Shirley|`|1WASp5iuaa	Heaven, so I have heard, consists of everybody's own mansion, streets of Gold bricks, and an absolute lack of pain, suffering, unhappiness or any likeness thereof. I truly believe in these things and that one will be able to live how life should be lived, to the fullest, and one will see things the way they ought to be seen. One will live in a interminable state of ecstasy along side those that they love, that is, the one's that made it.<br>  <br>  Hell is said to be a place where one shall eternally suffer in the Lake of Fire. Apparently, to the fire, one will never become accustomed. Also I believe one will be inside pure darkness, an almost painful darkness, where you will be alone with no one to console the constant pain. Hell sounds pretty bleak and therefore there isn't much to tell about it unlike it's counterpart.|`|fz8PCFRgaa	Scripture is really silent on this.  Hell is misunderstood.  When Jesus talked about it he was using allegory or metaphor as it were.  He was saying being separate from God is painful as a burning fire.  He was Jewish and they believe in a separation from God as kind of hell.  They are not as obsessed with heaven and hell as Christians have become.  They are concerned with making the world a better place.   Scripture is also quite silent on heaven.  What Christian espouse about it has been made up over the centuries.  I don't worry one way or the other about it.  If there is a heaven it has to be pretty cool.  Like fishing and and camping, and eternal summer at the lake.  That is how it would be for me.  I kind of hope for reincarnation because I want another whack at this old world.  I also agree with Buddhists in that we are not to concern ourselves with things we can't know, but try to make ourselves better people through the paths of enlightenment|`|pqveENjUaa	Christianity believes that Heaven is a place of joy and happiness, involving all the positive emotions one can experience. Likewise, Christians also believe that Hell is a place or horror and torture, encompassing all the negative emotions one can experience.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Heaven is eternity in heaven with Jesus!  :D<br>  <br>  Hell is eternal torment.  Eternal conscious torment. <br>  <br>  The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed in Jesus alone in this life or not. <br>  <br>  So to be in heaven and not hell, believe in Jesus alone now! :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|3339eebec4f413de65eaa978eb1efd50aa	Well.

xvxT46iJaa	I would say Spanish, because it is the most widely spoken.<br>  Mandarin has more speakers, but only in China, whereas Spanish can be spoken in almost all of South America, Central America, Spain (obviously) and some areas of East Asia (like the Philippines)<br>  <br>  I would say French is probably the next most useful as it's spoken in Canada, many countries in Africa, random islands in the pacific and indian oceans, French Guyana (South America) and a good few countries in Europe (France, Switzerland, Belgium).<br>  <br>  German, you will very rarely hear outside of Europe where it is the most widely spoken mother tongue. It is spoken in Germany, Belgium, Switzerland (although they speak Swiss German which is slightly different), Austria, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, and is recognised as a minority language in a few eastern european countries, as well as Namibia.<br>  <br>  I think it depends where you are going to travel, but overall i would learn Spanish, as so many places speak it, and if you are in Europe it is very similar to Italian and french, so you will find it easier to get the gist of what they are saying, whereas german is so different, it's harder to relate it to other european languages.|`|Y7Nd8a2uaa	spanish, because it can help you get into better colleges, get better jobs, and alot of people in the USA speak spanish.|`|SUBKGSQNaa	Spanish is the most widely spoken language after English and Chinese.

If you want to go into business, they are all equally important depending on where you want to do business with. If you want to do business with Asia, or if you like Asia, or want to travel to Asia, I would go with Mandarin Chinese. If you want to do any of those things with Europe, German would be most useful, followed by French and then Spanish. With Canada, French would be most useful, and with South America, the most useful would be Spanish. There are also communities of French speakers in Africa and Asia, so French would also be useful in those areas. <br>  <br>  In order of number of native speakers, they go like this:<br>  Mandarin Chinese<br>  Spanish<br>  German<br>  French<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|98XPkvSqaa	It depends where you live and the work you hope to do in your life.  If you live in some parts of the US, it would help you in day-to-day living to learn Spanish.

Otherwise it could take a lot longer.|`|ojVzcptTaa	i learn german now, it is an easy lanuage to understand, as long you take it seriouly and practise it wouldnt take you long at all.|`|sBrYcT5daa	Problem is, Germany is full of slangs and dialects. Much worse than in the US. Almost any village has some slang words only they understand. So you might be able to learn German in Germany, but the chance is pretty big that it is no proper German. Learning in school or by the book is particularly hard, because the German grammar is much harder to learn than most other "western' languages, e.g. English, Spanish, French... and German has about twice as many words of vocabulary than English. But like with ant language, the more you try, the better you'll get.|`|m4nKkFDUaa	As a native English speaker, learning French, Italian (and Irish btw) I find German very difficult, because although it's close to English, English itself is VERY complicated and you'd actually be surprised how different German is anyway.|`|5mHF9C8Iaa	Fluently?<br>  You won't Speak it fluently anytime.
495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	My dad was a Christian deacon back in the 1950's and 1960's who spent a lot of time comparing the Sermon on the Mount to Das Kapital. It probably got him blacklisted. The thing is, communism works really well up to about 50 people or so (sociologist have nailed the exact number, I don't remember what it is but it was less than 100). Most tribal societies are communistic by nature, and they work really well. Get over that number threshold, and it all goes to hell in a handbasket. All of the models Marx looked at in developing his dialectic were of small numbers of people. Jesus' model of communism was also more of the tribal variety than the statist variety. Tribal communism works, statist communism doesn't.|`|AA11382947	I agree.<br>  <br>  Jesus would not have been a Communist or a Socialist either one.<br>  <br>  He taught Personal responsibility and Personal freedom.|`|URO3gDXcaa	his teachings were communistic, yes.  but there has never been a communistic government.  ever.  marxist, yes.  communist, no.|`|NWopkX4baa	That's why the Shakers lived in psuedo-communist communities.

Just because you don't like my interpretation of the events, doesn't mean I've distorted them.|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Right, Jesus never taught how to solve problems using government.  All of his commands are on an individual basis, to people who are individually responsible for their own personal decisions.  Communism also essentially teaches us that we are all good at heart, and it's goal is to be greater, and stronger, and more powerful *by* pooling your goods.<br>  <br>  Jesus taught that you might become poor by giving all you have away, and in doing so, you will have treasure in heaven.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Coercion is a method used by communist and other authoritarian regimes.

jard50Yiaa	Cremation is the process of reducing human remains to basic elements in the form of bone fragments through flame, heat, and vaporization. Contrary to popular belief, the cremated remains are not ashes in the usual sense, but rather dried bone fragments that have been pulverized in a device called an electric cremated remains processor. This leaves the bone in a fine sand like texture and colour, able to be scattered without any foreign matter.<br>  <br>  Cremation may serve as a funeral or postfuneral rite that is an alternative to the interment of an intact body in a casket. Cremated remains, which are not a health risk, may be buried or immured in memorial sites or cemeteries, or they may be legally retained by relatives or dispersed in a variety of ways and locations.|`|AA10192697	Jesus will raise the dead and we will have new bodies, just like He did when He rose. His own disciples didn't even recognize Him until He ate with them and broke bread.  Our new bodies will be like heavenly bodies or spiritual bodies. That way we can go to Heaven or hell.  <br>  <br>  Since God can do anything, He can put a cremated body back together.  Think of the Sci-Fi movies showing mummies living again. Their ashed may swirl around and come together and such. God could do it.

Everyone would've been herbivores, not carnivores.  In the Bible, after the flood, God instructed Noah to eat the animals (because vegetation had been destroyed).  <br>  <br>  Dinosaur is a modern word that means terrible lizard.  Leviathan, lizard, flying serpent and dragon are terms that the bible does use.  With that in mind, consider the following Bible verses.  <br>  <br>  "Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?" Job 41:11<br>  <br>  "There the ships go to and fro, and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there." Psalms 104:26<br>  <br>  "The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and FIERY FLYING SERPENT, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them."

Nero Ceasar. as for the wound he rose from, it was rumored that Nero would rise from the dead to keep persecuting christians. Revelations was so controversial,even in its own day,that it almost didn't even make the cut into the final version of the Christian Bible. the mark was conicided w/compliance w/Rome,and sacrificing to the deity emperor,something John chided one of the churches for earlier in the letter. as the others said, read for yourself. bush did mandate a card as a part of the Patriot act, called the REAL ID card, but it's highly unlikely Obama would let it actually come to be. prophecies are written for ppl w/in that prophet's life time, not for far in the future,at least biblical prophecy.|`|dzZWv5BCaa	Islam didn't exist when the bible was written, so it can't say that.

Goverments try to keep track of citizens for as long as they exist, so this is nothing new (Americans, for example, all have social security numbers for many years now, and the Antichrist doesn't seem to have shown up so far).<br>  <br>  In general, what a prophecy needs to be a success is vagueness and hordes of dumb followers willing to apply it to anything, and Nostradamus and the Bible enjoy both.<br>  <br>  I hope my answer helps.|`|kuBBzXtiaa	Barack Obama is not the antichrist. The catholic church is always going to find things to link to the bible. ( I am Catholic so I am not being mean)<br>  <br>  That is not positive.

The mayan calender predicts the end of the fourth age not the end of the world. Think of their 5th age like our second millenium. Lots of hype but not much happened.<br>  3 The mark of the beast from the book of revelations. According to the King James Version 5 Bible it sounds more like a tattoo than a microchip. This poor book has been "interpreted" to mean whatever people want it to mean.|`|bdb55be6a334c9e912e60b4a6db49e5daa	Obama does fit the profile of the anti-christ in the bible.  As the bible states, the antichrist comes to power from nowhere.  Before he takes power, no one has heard of him.  The bible says something about the antichrist and a head injury.<br>  <br>  Here is my justification on believing that he MAY be the anti-christ.  However, with that in mind, I will also state that I am hoping I am WRONG because I own a business and this year, 2009, we have grown a lot and if Obama is the antichrist, then the world is ending and I'll never get to see how successful my business will become.  While everyone else is laying off, our business has hired 50 people in the last month, and we currently just put more than 10,000 positions available on our website for employment.  All I can say is I am hoping I'm wrong, because if I'm right, I'm gonna be a little po'd and I've told my parents that if he is, then God and I are gonna have a little chat! (Just a funny, laugh).  Anyways, this is my justifation for believing he may be:<br>  <br>  Obama was a muslim that suddenly converted to a christian when he married his wife.  Before, he was a devote muslim.  Seems awful strange.  Who more to convince and persecute all the christians of the world than a muslim?  He came from nowhere!  Who heard of Obama before this election?  No one.  He wasn't even in politics for very long.<br>  <br>  The bible states that the generation that saw Isreal become a nation, will see the return of Christ.  It became a nation in the 1950's.  That generation is starting to get up there in age, so it's gonna happen sooner or later.<br>  <br>  There is a microchip already in many things.  They can make chips so small it will fit on a $$ bill and you'd never know it.  HOWEVER, the bible says it will be in/on the skin.  For the past few years, they have put microchips in our pets with basic information.  More recently, they are saying to get babies with microchips in them so in case someone abducts them, the GPS will track right to the location of the child.  Also, in Oregon and in other states, they are considering a bill to place this chip in sex offenders to keep track of their every movements.  What's stopping them from requiring it in everyone once it makes it past the "experimental" stage?  I call it experimental, in the publics eye, who better to have the chip and be accepted than put them in sex offenders?  No one would question it.  It may be a possible experiment to see how well it works before requiring EVERYONE to have it.<br>  <br>  The world ending in 2012.  The bible is very clear, no one will know the time of the end.  If the bible is true, then December of 2012 will not be the end of the world because too many people believe it to be true.  The mayans made many predictions.  The calender ends on December 12, 2012 (If you'll notice, it's all relative to the number 6..it's 666 times 2, or, 333 times 4, but speaking anti-christ wise, it's still the 666).<br>  <br>  The mayans believed on that date, something great will change the face of the earth.  Here's what I believe.  It's not the end of the world.  Instead, the bible refers to the end times, the tribulation, the 7 years of the anti-christs reign.  The first 3 1/2 years is peaceful, and the last 3 1/2 years is when all heck breaks loose.  Following the mayans predictions, it makes more sense to believe that the December 12, 2012 is actually the MIDDLE of the tribulation, when the antichrist is killed, and Satan comes back in his form to cause chaos and war and kill anyone that does not follow him.  It makes much more sense and fits the bibles description of no one knowing the exact time.  It doesn't say anything about guessing the day when the antichrist is killed and satan takes over.<br>  <br>  Obama has been too popular among some of the terrorist countries.  Why were all the terrorist countries, communist countries, and everyone else rooting for Obama?  Iran sent a letter of congrats to Obama when he was elected president!!  All these countries that wanted to declare war against us and proclaimed us their enemy suddenly are willing to have a treaty with Obama, and peace.  It's strange.<br>  <br>  To bring up something I mentioned in the beginning.  The bible mentions something about the antichrist and a head injury.<br>  <br>  Obama is a major backer for a bill in congress that he's always pushed, to bring more funding to the US Armed forces for vetrans that have suffered from a head injury.  While it may be indirect, he's still involved with the head injury part as mentioned in the bible for the anti-christ.<br>  <br>  There's more too this, I could write a book about what I believe and why I believe it, but I'll go back to my first point..If Obama really is the Antichrist like I believe he is, I'm going to be extremely upset.  This is one time I want to be wrong because my business is growing VERY rapidly and we've been able to offer employment to a lot of people these past few months.  While everyone else is laying off, we're hiring! (Part time people)<br>  <br>  I'm

Presumably the ratio of ale-wives to monarchs was quite high at all periods of Western history, so one would expect to see this reflected in reincarnations.

As Dr. Johnson says, "Malice is punished by neglect."  I'm sure the memory of what your former friend said is distasteful to you (to say the least); rather than aggravate its effect on you by dwelling on it, or much deliberating on what you ought to do in response to it--Do what you normally do with serious unpleasantness about which you can do nothing:  Put it out of your mind.  And when next your former friend reminds you of it by trying to contact you, tell him that you refuse to speak with him, now or ever again, and--with no further explanation (Why should you subject yourself to any further consideration of the matter?)--hang up.
4vLt3SqFaa	Massage is not quite the right word - prostitution  - yeah that the right term.  If you make any such suggestion to a licensed therapist you will have your session end on the spot without refund and likely will be banned from ever using the facility.<br>  <br>  If you are visiting a thinly disguised form of prostitution know as a massage parlor then rates will be a heck of lot more than 20% of your entry fee.  If you paid 40 for your, "massage" then expect at least 60 more for the type of happy ending you are suggesting.and more for any other services.  <br>  <br>  Also budget for bail as cops raid such places regularly and you will be charged as a John if you are in the building. <br>  <br>  If you are lucky the area you are in will have a Johns school where you will learn about the industry. Show up for the class, pay the $250 tuition, wear a name tag that reads sex crimes, then stay out of trouble for six months, and charges are dismissed. If you aren't lucky no such program is available and you go to court and risk up to 90 days in jail, your name in the newspaper and probably divorce.  <br>  <br>  In addition  you should know that 30% of the girls in some areas like NY are underage and a good many below the age of legal consent.  You will be charged with solicitation of child prostitution if with a girl below the age of consentand you will become a permanent fixture on the sex offender's list, your life ruined for a lousy orgasm.<br>  <br>  Think about this dude.

FmazIF6Maa	There are a lot of options with homeschooling.<br>  <br>  You can homeschool her yourself; you just submit your letter of intent to the board of ed. and follow the state laws (your local board of ed cannot hold you to more than your state homeschooling laws require, though they will sometimes try). <br>  <br>  You can purchase pre-packaged curriculum and present it to her and let her work through it at her own pace. <br>  <br>  You can sign  her up for a virtual academy or online school.<br>  <br>  You can go out in the world and join a homeschool co-operative, take classes from community centers and museums and such, join in volunteer things for practical hands-on experience, start a home based business as an educational experience or take on  year-long 4H projects-- basically, go about it creatively.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lots of info can be found at: <a href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/</a><br>  <br>  and there is a Y!A section for homeschooling under education where many veteran homeschoolers hang out.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The big myth you'll encounter is: What about socialization!!!?? This is ridiculous, as school is not the only (not even the best) place to send your kid to socialize. I've worked in public schools; the chance of your kid coming out positively socialized is not that great, and usually kids with good manners and respect and who are friendly get that more from their home upbringing than their peers. <br>  <br>  Not to mention-- they've done experiments where they put a group of kids in a room and child psychologists had to observe them, and could not tell which kids were homeschooled and which were public schooled (ERIC.gov, Patricia M. Lyons).|`|v20S8oSJaa	turn her into a vamp then all the kids will play with her!|`|iRyY75gNaa	Well, I am a teenager, 14 years of age, and I am home schooled. The program I am taking is basically virtual school which is 100% free in Florida (Talk to your child's councilor about virtual school and see if it's available in your area/state). This is a very good program, you can graduate much faster than traditional schools; i.e. Since I am a freshman, I can finish school in about 2 years while in traditional schools it would take 4 years (this all varies on how many hours a day your child studies). I for instance study form 8:30 to 2:30. These courses are very easy, they offer full scholarships, and if your child is planning on studing in a university in your state, they can take a 18-credit course instead of a 24-credit course which means you can finish even faster!

Reason: radiometric dating.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	6000 yrs or more....salvation is more important.|`|qyoXSdPCaa	I believe the Earth is young because many dating techniques show the Earth and Solar System to be so.<br>  <br>      1.  Direct measurements of the earth's magnetic field over the past 140<br>       years show a steady and rapid decline in its strength.  This decay<br>       pattern is consistent with the theoretical view that there is an<br>       electrical current inside the earth which produces the magnetic field.<br>       If this view is correct, then 25,000 years ago the electrical current<br>       would have been so vast that the earth's structure could not have<br>       survived the heat produced. This would imply that the earth could not be<br>       older than 25,000 years.<br>  <br>       2.  The atmosphere has less than 40,000 years worth of helium, based on<br>       just the production of helium from the decay of uranium and thorium.<br>       There is no known means by which large amounts of helium can escape from<br>       the atmosphere.  The atmosphere appears to be young.<br>  <br>       3.  The rate at which elements such as copper, gold, tin, lead, silicon,<br>       mercury, uranium and nickel are entering the oceans is very rapid when<br>       compared with the small quantities of these elements already in the<br>       oceans.  Therefore, the oceans must be very much younger than a million<br>       years.<br>  <br>       4.  Evolutionists believe that the continents have existed for at least<br>       1 billion years.  However, the continents are being eroded at a rate<br>       that would have leveled them in a relatively short 14 million years.<br>  <br>       5.  The occurrence of abnormally high gas and oil pressures within<br>       relatively permeable rock implies that these fluids were formed or<br>       encased less than 10,000 years ago.  If these hydrocarbons had been<br>       trapped over 10,000 years ago, there would have been leakage which would<br>       have dropped the pressure to a level far below what it is today.<br>  <br>       6.  There have been no authenticated reports of the discovery of<br>       meteorites in sedimentary material.  If the sediments, which have an<br>       average depth of 1 1/2 miles, were laid down over hundreds of millions<br>       of years, many of these steadily falling meteorites should have been<br>       discovered.  Therefore, the sediments appear to have been deposited<br>       rapidly; furthermore, since there have been no reports of meteorites<br>       beneath the sediments, they appear to have been deposited recently.<br>  <br>       7.  Since 1836, over one hundred different observers at the Royal<br>       Greenwich Observatory and U.S. Naval Observatory have made direct visual<br>       measurements which show that the diameter of the sun is shrinking at a<br>       rate of about .1% each century or about 5 feet per hour!  Furthermore,<br>       records of solar eclipses indicate that this rapid shrinkage has been<br>       going on for at least the past 400 years.  Several indirect techniques<br>       also confirm this gravitational collapse, although these inferred<br>       collapse rates are only about 1/7th as much.  Using the most<br>       conservative data, one must conclude that had the sun existed one<br>       million years ago, it would have been so large that it would have heated<br>       the earth so much that life could not have survived.  Yet, evolutionists<br>       say that a million years ago all the present forms of life were<br>       essentially as they are now, having completed their `evolution` that<br>       began 200 million years ago.<br>  <br>       8.  Short period comets "boil off" some of their mass each time they<br>       pass the sun.  Nothing should remain of these comets after about 10,000<br>       years.  There are no known sources for replenishing comets.  If comets<br>       came into existence at the same time as the solar system, the solar<br>       system must be less than 10,000 years old.<br>  <br>       9.  Jupiter and Saturn are each radiating more than twice the energy<br>       they receive from the sun.  Calculations show that it is very unlikely<br>       that this energy comes from radioactive decay or gravitational<br>       contraction.  The only other conceivable explanation is that these<br>       planets have not existed long enough to cool off.<br>  <br>       10.  The sun's gravitational field acts as a giant vacuum cleaner which<br>       sweeps up about 100,000 tons of micrometeorites per day.  If the solar<br>       system were just 10,000 years old, no micrometeoroids should remain<br>       since there is no significant source of replenishment.  A large disk<br>       shaped cloud of these particles is orbiting the sun.  Conclusion: the<br>       solar system is less than 10,000 years old.<br>  <br>       11.  Stars frequently travel in closely spaced clusters, moving in the<br>       same direction at nearly the same speed.  This would not be the case if<br>       they had been traveling for billions of years, because even the<br>       slightest difference in their velocity would cause their dispersal after<br>       such great periods of time.<br>  <br>       12. If man and languages `evolved`, the earliest languages should be the<br>       simplest.  On the contra|`|AA12193600	3 different forms of radio-isotope dating tell us the world is between 4 and 5 billion years old.  This same number we find taken from rocks all over the world time and again.  The odds that this value is not true are basically billions to one against.  Therefore new earth creationism is a false doctrine and has been totally disproved.  The new earth creationists can't take the position that the decay rate changes--in order for the world to be 6000 years old the decay rate of uranium would have to be apporximately 100,000 to a 1,000,000 times great 6000 years ago to get to the present position.  If that premise is made then the world was blown to bits 6000 years ago--because that sort of decay rate is sufficent for all naturally occuring unranium to go critical and turn those deposits into gigantic out of control fission reactors.  So no--the earth is 4.5 billion give or take and CREATIONISM is a pathetic lie.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	About 4.55 billion years. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-...</a>|`|k4WlqPK7aa	4.5 billion years roughly. scientifically accepted fact.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-...</a>|`|VU4DLpnlaa	around 4.5 billion years, cos i believe in scientific evidence, not some southern science teacher.|`|dQCZDAqgaa	about 6 billion years. why, because that is what the expert scientists say it is.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Pretty old.|`|o0I5YXMNaa	There is strong scientific evidence for a young earth.

But it seems obvious that they'll just be trying to catch up. I didn't want to go to my HS reunion so I didn't and the only thing I feel I missed out on was maybe seeing a few people that I actually do talk to on Facebook. So it wasn't a great loss. <br>  If they are rude enough to ask something like that then say "I have been doing other things" and talk about the positive things you have accomplished since graduating.|`|929b0210e46cbd96484f7032e99a63afaa	Aren't reunions fun?! Nothing like being cornered by people you hardly remember to make you feel awkward and uncomfortable. Questions like "why aren't you married?" are totally rude, and don't really deserve an answer beyond "mind your own business," except that would be totally rude as well. Be vague and move on - the personal details of your life are no one's business!

Just smile politely and excuse yourself to go talk to someone else in the room, or get some punch, etc. They will get the hint.|`|Yi7AR18qaa	The best way to deflect personal questions is to keep your answer very short and candid. <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  Q: Why haven't you married?<br>  A: I have personal things to deal with.<br>  <br>  By answering this way, a person will get the idea that you don't want to go any further into the conversation.

Just restate your previous answer.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Why you're not married - I just haven't met "the one" yet. :)<br>  <br>  Why you haven't finished school - Because you took a break<br>  <br>  That should pretty much sum it up. :)|`|IkAtIQumaa	Keep your answer short.

jcK6EXpiaa	The bible is supposed to be a recap of the Torah, like an addition to it. Just as the Torah was revealed to reinstate the revelations of the previous messengers. The original scriptures of the Bible were committed to memory, yet because they were not promised divine protection, were subject to alteration. Four hundred years after the birth of christ, the Romans comprised a document of scripture, containing some of the original concepts revealed through Jesus (peace be upon him) but laced with many fabrications designed to suit the needs of the Roman polititions. If you want to go back to the root of the holy revelations, you'd have to start with Adam (pbuh), the first Messenger to Humankind (also the first human) God has sent his message through thousands and thousands of messengers all throughout the history of human kind, some are mentioned within the Torah and Bible and Quran, some are best known through the oral history their peoples keep, and many have been forgotten. They all taught the same basic fundimentals though, and if anybody along the line committed these revelations to written form before the Torah, then it is unknown.|`|AA12384132	There have been men working on the bible for centuries and I know that prior to Moses setting the Hebrews free from Egypt writings that are now found in the bible were written.... So before the bible was written, There pages  of the bible being written and I do know the the Essene and the very early prophets were to fist to compile a bible... Which made up part of the the old testament's in the BC... Now the Bible as we know the bible was done somewhere around the 2nd century A.D.

St Jerome, who was raised up by God to translate the scriptures from the original Greek Hebrew Syriac and Aramaic, put it all together in the Latin Vulgate. Latin was the common language of the empire. The bible stood until the 16th century, when a renegade monk named Martin Luther abridged the bible, and shattered Christianity forever. Pax Christi|`|ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	The first compiled Canon of  Bible was used in the 2nd century. In the 4th century there was agreements on some translations and removals.

The Hebrews have never called their books Bibles. Bible is an offshoot of the Koine Greek word Biblos. Therefore, When you ask for "first bible," you are asking for the Christian version of the Hebrew Books and the compiled works of Christians on Jesus.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	the first testament was first written at like 1000 bc<br>  whether it was on tablets or walls.. idk<br>  <br>  its not as old as other religion beliefs.|`|m89kGXBnaa	There were many scriptures written over many centuries. Because this started to produce contradictions and other problems, an orthodox "Bible" was produced. The canonical New Testiment was produce over a long period of time, not all at once nor by any one person, but it was probably complete as we know it today by the third/forth century.<br>  <br>  The Old Testiment was translated by Jerome and became accepted (at the time, he was considered a forger for choosing to work from the Hebrew texts rather than the Latin). This lead to some differences in passages regarding prediction of Christ, which may be why the Christian church prefers Jerome's version, and the Jews prefer the Septuagint (which Jerome chose not to translate from). Jerome was largely responsible for the Vulgate, which is the basis of the present day Old Testiment, which was written in 382 AD (around then, anyway.)|`|BhzCW1rYaa	The oldest Bible in the world today is The Sinai Bible, and when compared with modern day Bibles, a staggering 14,800 differences can be identified...<br>  Here are some more facts for you; The King James Version used the words "original" and "authentic" and "authorised" Ho, Ho, Ho... <br>  The "original" Greek text was not written down until around the mid-Fourth Century and was a revised edition of writings compiled decades earlier in Aramaic and Hebrew... Those earlier documents no longer exist and the Bibles we have today are 5 linguistic removes from the first Bibles written... What was written in the "original originals" is quite unknown... It is important to remember that the words "authorised" and "original", as applied the the Bible, do not mean "genuine", "authentic" or "true"....<br>  Another point here, did you know that Sir Francis Bacon was the editor of the KJV of the Bible ??? ...

I suggest finding a mountainous area which will be hard for zombies to climb. You will have a good survey of the area as well, enabling you to prepare for any unwanted visitors. Another idea is to kill a zombie and rub its body on your clothes. The zombie smell might make you uninteresting for other zombies, although I am not sure if this really works. If nothing else works, select 'Heavy Metal' on your iPod and go rampaging with your Katana/axe/crowbar/ wooden stick.<br>  <br>  Factors which make up a good stronghold:<br>  - Places with narrow hallways - Ever seen the movie 300? You'll know why; it renders he zombies unable to attack all at once.<br>  <br>  - Not too many entrances, but more than one - The less entrances your stronghold has, the less ways there are for the zombies to break in. You'll need an emergency exit though.<br>  <br>  - Storage room - You'll need space to store lots of canned food. Who knows how long you might have to wait in there?<br>  <br>  - Near location - The better you know your environment, the higher your chance of survival.<br>  <br>  I recommend a school you've gone to. If you can get a group together, it won't be that hard to defend, you have lots of space, the doors are usually quite stable, at some schools you can climbe the roof to survey the area, etc.

If you are serious, directly confront the presence that is troubling you. Call it out. Tell it you will not have it bothering you. Here's a little secret that Christianity doesn't want you to know :<br>  <br>  Demons can only hurt you if they have been invited to. Tell them that they can do you no harm. If you continue to have trouble, seek out an elder, a shaman, or a priest. Most religious leaders, believe it or not, can successfully eradicate the situation.|`|s2GCKeouaa	The Christians have it partially right -- call on the name of your Divinity, and command the demon to leave in the name of that God.

Just stand firm, speak with authority, and know that spirits cannot harm you physically or directly.  My favorite method is to fumigate the house with sage or incense and sprinkle salt water into the corners of each room, commanding the entity to leave.<br>  <br>  The Atheists have it partially correct too -- consult a mental health professional if the problem persists, as these things usually have a strong psychological component.|`|0JE41mXsaa	Go to Church and ask to speak to the priest.  The priest will come and bless your home or if it is a person that is possessed then he will perform an exorcism.  <br>  <br>  In the Orthodox Christian practice an exorcism is performed as part of the Baptism service; i.e. it's very common.  <br>  <br>  That said - once the prayers are said it is incumbent on YOU to alter your life so nothing worse happens.  You will need to make changes in your life like:<br>  a) Regular attendance at Church<br>  b) Regular participation in the mysteries (sacraments) of Holy Repentance (Confession) and Holy Communion<br>  c) Removal from your home evil things (pornography, horror movies, satanic music, occult stuff, idols, pagan symbols, etc.)<br>  d) Begin living a Christian lifestyle; meaning that you "deny yourself, take up your Cross and Follow Christ"<br>  An example of self-denial.

When Satan (lucifer) rebelled against God he did it with a 3rd of the Angels in Heaven. God Defeated this Angels and sent them to live on the Earth. Satan and Demon do not come from hell and do not live in Hell.

It doesn't matter how much of His Word you know if you can't live the life of live. <br>  Faith works by love.<br>  <br>  Finally remember, Jesus said that problems do come in life, but He said to be of good cheer.  Why? Because He overcame them.  And we get to receive the benefits.  He gave them to us.<br>  <br>  Don't be so afraid of demons and the devil to the point where you look for them in everything wrong in life.  Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.  <br>  <br>  Even if you run into the devil face to face in the street, the Life of God, the Power of God, the Goodness of God, the Love of God is bigger and stronger and surer than anything he can throw at him.<br>  <br>  He gave you authority over him.

Mnm35sjNaa	Whether or not we choose God, we use our free will.<br>  <br>  Before I explain, I'll define my terms.<br>  <br>  The controversy over free will is divided into 3 camps: determinists, libertarians, and compatibilists.  They've been debating this issue for 1600 years . . . ever since St. Augustine first fleshed out the concept of free will.<br>  <br>  Determinism is based on causality, cause and effect.  If, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction, then (conceivably) one could extrapolate any future scenario from the Big Bang onwards.  In other words, everything is predetermined or predestined.<br>  <br>  Libertarians believe in free will to the exclusion of determinism.  They don't believe anything is "written in the stars".<br>  <br>  Compatibilists believe that free will is compatible with determinism.  I fall into this camp.<br>  <br>  As for your question . . .<br>  <br>  . . . Freewill is NOT taught by the Bible because the concept of freewill wasn’t developed or championed until around the year 400 A.D. Incredible but true.  Please note that some verses may be interpreted as supporting free will but this is just a reflection of the reality of free will . . . not a conscious acknowledgment of the doctrine of free will.  In other words, tacit acknowledgment of free will is unavoidable in our lives and language whether or not we believe in it or even understand it.  We ALL live, work, play and plan as if we have free will.<br>  <br>  The concept of free will stems from the concept of freedom and developed very slowly, taking centuries to mature into a formal doctrine.<br>  <br>  From the 4th century to the 2nd century B.C., the seeds of free will were being planted. Plato had a concept of rational governance which flirted with but skirted the concept of free will. Aristotle added an element of voluntary action but still skirted free will. The first, primitive, form of free will appears to arise with Epicurus, around 300 B.C. Determinism did not mesh with his observations. He diverged from the strictly deterministic Atomists of his day by claiming that atoms do not move in a pre-determined way. Making the motion of atoms random allowed him to break the perpetual causal chain of events kick-started by the Prime Mover. This opened the door for his assertion that man has free will.<br>  <br>  It's hard to understand how the ramifications of free will would take centuries to reveal themselves to our ancient philosophers unless you keep in mind that virtually the entire population of the ancient world believed in determinism. With the introduction of Christianity and its morality, particularly after it became the state religion (Roman Catholic Church) of the Roman Empire in 326 A.D., the development of free will was given a boost. Free will matured into doctrine, thanks largely to St. Augustine. He began advocating free will, around 400 A.D, to promote good works and responsibility to God and for our own actions.<br>  <br>  That's 700 to 800 years of free will as a fuzzy, immature concept! It's hard to imagine when many of us now take free will for granted.<br>  <br>  An omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God may choose to observe his creation (cosmic God) or he may choose to meddle (intervene or intercede) in his creation (personal God). There's a clear contradiction between a personal God and freewill. Even with a cosmic God, there are logical entanglements between omniscience and freewill.<br>  <br>  The Abrahamic God is a personal God. The Bible clearly reveals that God intervenes in human affairs. Jesus himself performed miracles and claims you can ask God to intercede in your life.<br>  <br>  So, if a personal God necessarily contradicts, usurps and negates our freewill, we must not have any free will -- unless there is NO personal God (i.e. a cosmic one) or no God at all.<br>  <br>  Your question touches upon a fundamental truth: the question of freewill cuts to the core of scriptural (Torah, Bible, Qur'an) veracity and reveals the ignorance and lies that dogma tries to cover up.<br>  <br>  You have free will.  What you choose to believe is up to you.|`|ZNRYqss9aa	Not if your christen you must follow the bible or go to hell, it only makes people follow the religion|`|H8WqMK1eaa	God "calls."<br>  <br>  You have the choice to pick up the phone or not.|`|pvabglXhaa	God's grace and his offer of eternal life with Him is there for every human being on our planet.<br>  <br>  Some will hear about Him and choose to give their lives to Him and others will not.<br>  <br>  We all have free will to live our lives in whatever way we see fit.<br>  <br>  I do believe though that if you have known God and walked away, that He will call you back again and that will happen in a way that God chooses.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	5-point Calvinist here, with this "caveat" -- anyone who "chooses" God has already been chosen, so I've got no problem with Billy Graham-style "altar calls."|`|kLf8xFp7aa	We pick God.

3cnNksD0aa	I disagree.  Many of my best friends are guys.  While it may be true that there are some men in the world who are pigs, I don't think that by any means they represent the majority of men in the world.  I mean, the idea of having sex with a man repulses me, but that's not anything to do with them, it's my own personal preference, and it doesn't reflect on them in any way.  I can only think that some radical feminist lesbians go too far in their aversion to the male anatomy, and confuse that with hatred of men as a whole, and that's unfortunate, because actually, most men aren't that bad.  <br>  <br>  Now, as for what men think of lesbians, I would have to disagree with you here.  Yes, men like the idea of two women being sexual, and from the man's point of view, that isn't a bad thing.  However, there are some who would argue that the portrayal of lesbians as sexual entertainment for men is degrading and offensive.  The other extreme, of course, is the scary homophobic fundamentalist men, who think lesbians (and all of the queer community for that matter) are bad and sinful.  Also not very nice.  Now I'm not saying that either of those things apply to all men, of course, the majority of people don't have a strong opinion either way.  I try not to be too opinionated about any group, be it straight men, gay men, lesbians or straight women.  But the truth is, men and women, gay and straight, we all say and think bad stuff about each other sometimes, and you just have to learn to live with it, and rather than retaliate, just try to prove them wrong by showing the best of yourself.|`|qbLTYbZlaa	Men are not pigs.

I know some pretty cool guys, & I know some who calling them a pig would be an injustic to the pig!  It depends on the person.<br>  <br>  As far as NEVER hearing a guy call a lesbian anything bad?  Hmm, you may want to rephrase THAT.  Dyke, bull-dagger, she-male, too ugly to get a man, etc are the things I have heard men call women as soon as they were aware of the woman's sexual orientation.

KjQaxGX0aa	Hi you know us humans can be dull creatures and we go about our daily routine which can be mundane and boring.  It is our interests and beliefs in something which make us believe or not. Ghosts are real to a lot of people and they have been part of different cultures since the beginning of time.  It can either be comforting or scary to think that we do not just die and then nothing.  There seems to be too much evidence that things that go bump in the night do exist.  Imagine a world without the supernatural and no ghost stories.  Some parts of the planet as so fast paced that we have deadened our natural instincts, like intuition, sixth sense, that feeling something is wrong or not quite right.  You don't necessarily have to be a believer or open to the suggestion that ghosts are real.  I have known total non-believers who have experienced the other side and it has had a profound effect upon them.  I have experieced ghosts or unexplainable phenomena and at times I have been startled but never really scared.  If you ever experience something that you don't understand just embrass it and keep going.  As the saying goes 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' so it the belief in something other than this world.<br>  <br>  cheers|`|YTasscmKaa	If you don't believe in them, why are you scared?

Best of luck to you.|`|92H6rm03aa	I would ask you to put two things on the scale: your discomfort at being the center of attention, and the feelings of DOZENS of your relatives.  I can't imagine that your discomfort would add up to anything near the hurt that you will cause by shutting out the majority of your family.  After all, they are there to CELEBRATE you.<br>  <br>  Marriage is about compromise.  I urge you to consider starting yours with a heart-felt compromise offered to those who are only guilty of being your loving family and friends.
pfke6Jieaa	i agree with the first answer. since the white males are running the show they portray anything they want. they can turn a black or asian person to a god in a second because the media controls the minds of ppl and they know it. but if ppl woke up and think for themselves then they would see the good in everyone.|`|e2023980e76f8f01d5ba81251c994b7caa	Because Blacks and Asians don't run the tv and movie studio's.  <br>  What is an American to think?  Hopefully they've got an open enough mind to look past what on tv or in movies because it basically plays into stereotypes.  <br>  For example - blacks/latinos are always indicated for always being on welfare and using up all the federal money.  Even if you combined the number of blacks and latinos in this country it would still be no where near the number of whites on welfare...but they'll never say that out loud.<br>  Tv is tv and movies are movies.  You know what you see in real life.  base your conclutions on what you see in front of you.  If you're upset that a little black girl goes missing, and 3 weeks go by and there's nothing on the news about it - do something about it.  Make phone calls, write emails, protest.

rThIVk2maa	I don't know about you, but the doctors I see don't see me completely naked when I have appointments. I also assume that since they have other patients waiting for their time, they have more important things to do than watch me self-consciously strip off my clothes in front of them.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Too much like a strip tease; I wondered that myself but at least you can get that little paper towel on before they return.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	They typically go into the next exam room and see another patient while you disrobe and put the paper gown on.  I once had a doctor stay in the room while I was getting dressed after my 6 week post baby checkup and I felt very self conscious and uncomfortable.  When they examine you it is a professional thing however it just felt weird afterwards to have him see me standing there getting dressed...way too personal feeling!!|`|8OREBeRdaa	It's just plain courtesy and some patients may already be uncomfortable as it is having the doctor look them over without having the doc gawk @ them getting changed.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	A lot of people don't want someone to see them getting undressed and the doctor knows that, so he leaves the room untill you are done.|`|fmkwdNJyaa	out of simple respect and to avoid lawsuits|`|ddTnMtc6aa	There is some inclination to stimulation----like a strip tease  when the process is gradual.  The doctor is professional and is intended to look at the piece being examined, not enjoy the "dance"- as clumsy as it may be.  Furthermore, it maintains some dignity, many modern people fail to possess.  If there is something that is not necessary to have been removed, but needs adjustment- like an upper torso examination may still need the strip and the lay down...but your knickers may ride up....and so you can adjust them with a bit of private dignity.|`|R1zUIh7taa	Sometimes when I really don't want to be there...

ch9ipCTKaa	The requirement for a so-called "gay" gene is not solely to determine if homosexuality is a choice as opposed to being something you are born like. <br>  <br>  It is also to determine if it's a birth defect, psychological problem, emotional problem, psychiatric problem, hereditary etc. If no such gene exists, as all the evidence shows, then it could also be some other problem. <br>  <br>  The choice factor is simply whether the person acts on their problem, or continues to live in denial and justify themselves with the constant stream of deceit and manipulations that is so common today.

Even if it were a choice, it's your choice to make and nobody should interfere with it.<br>  <br>  I think the problem some Christians have with homosexuals is caused not by a misunderstanding of the nature of homosexuality, but by not using the alleged-God-given gift on minding one's own damn business.|`|SDdooOuzaa	Those who pull the gene card are basically saying its not my fault.

I really don't think there's a proven genetic link for homosexuality though.  I guess a scientist can take a bunch of male fruit flies, trigger a gene that makes them really horny so they have sex with whatever is near by (another male fruit fly), and claim that the gene made them homosexual though.  It would be a better test if there were more female fruit flies present to see if that gene would cause them to bypass the preponderance of female fruit flies and go for the male one.  I don't think they did that test though because it wouldn't yeild results to match their hypothesis.  Who knows (or cares)?|`|e8UujnJnaa	thank you

Worship songs meant to praise the Lord are very repetitive and monotnous losing their meaning.  I prefer hymns because they have meat if you know what I mean.  As for Christian bands there are some wonderful ones out there and single artists depending on your style of music from hard rock to contemp or rap... that also have meat or deeper meaning and do not fall into the category of droning music lol.   Yes the praise songs get old and why oh why do some churches have you sing the song over again when the song is comprised of like 5 lines lol?  *gets off soapbox*<br>   <br>  Blessings|`|Lp5aXKjKaa	Good question...and I think you'll find it that way if you listen to the same style of music.<br>  <br>  There are TONS of genre's of Christian Music out there.

(and the la before piace is a direct object pronoun)<br>  <br>  and it's divertente, in the second sentence ;)

AA12346187	if the Palestinians  will stop firing there can be  peace.|`|FBrwlhPtaa	The Palestinians want a total inhiliation of the Jews. I could NEVER support the Palestinians for just that reason!|`|Im9cwUIyaa	The Palestinians do NOT want total inhalation of the Jews.  The exact opposite is true.  They were living peacefully on their land until 1948 when the state of Israel pushed them off their land.  In 1900 only 3% of what is now Israel was Jewish.  There was a larger Christian population than Jewish.  European Jews started immigration there after WW1 but they weren't violent.  It was in the 40s when the persecution of the native inhabitants started.  In fact, a majority of Jesus's followers were probably of Palestinian descent.<br>  <br>  The Palestinians are treated like animals on their own land.  What would you do if people came to where you lived and tried to kick you out?  I'm not condoning violence I'm just saying i understand where the anger comes from.<br>  <br>  It's kind of like how China treats Tibet.  Or how the White people forced the Native American population off their land and killed them.|`|i00SbscLaa	None-violence alone will not do with the Israeli hard-core right-wing zionist.

Palestine should go to other arab nations and all the arab nations should be boycotted, because all arabs are terrorists.
GoRFRY2naa	Spells are real, but they are nothing like what you see in movies.  They are largely a combination of focused concentration and visualization, for me.  I don't speak for all Witches, just myself.<br>  <br>  Spells are cast for a variety of things, but writing on out for you would not help you cast it effectively without some training beforehand.  I don't write out spells, as they are a product of my head and heart.<br>  <br>  And the idiots who referred  to this as demonic are just showing their ignorance.  We pagans do not believe in devils or demons or Satan.  those are in  Christianity, and Christians can keep them.  We don't believe in such silliness.<br>  <br>  blessings,<br>  Lady Morgana|`|ZNRYqss9aa	Ok pagans are people that are not Christian. <br>  Wiccans believe that you can only do something if you have the will to do it. Also wiccans believe that you can't hurt others this can mean changing other peoples views. <br>  Wiccans and witchcraft are different they just come from similar concepts.|`|UxooffHZaa	Yes it's real, and yes the benefits are all psychological. Well, maybe not "all" psychological, but the most important thing magic changes is yourself.|`|yp8y1jrCaa	Wicca is a nature based religion that honors a Triple Goddess and a Horned God.<br>  <br>  The practice predates Christianity, but new forms of it re-established in the early 1950's.<br>  <br>  They trust in a three-fold karma...and believe it is better to do good regardless. I do count it as a very honorable faith based practice.<br>  <br>  They care much for the earth, and nature. From what I have learned about it, it is amazing. <br>  <br>  I don't think "spells" are top priority. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca</a>|`|wwdllMzYaa	well<br>  thats not something i can answer for you<br>  <br>  its soemthing you have to decide for yourself<br>  i woudlnt have beleived in it if i hadnt experienced it<br>  <br>  however being pagan has nothing to do with witchcraft and spells, unless the pagan individual wishes it to<br>  pagan is jsut a nature respect and acknowledgement and yes, thats very real|`|7cBOKehWaa	I could answer this honestly, but I'd get a swarm of thumbs down and probably a violation notice.<br>  <br>  So I'll refrain.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	It's real, yes. I don't recommend it, though.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Yes, "this stuff" is real.<br>  <br>  Pagan - derived from latin basically means "country dweller" - and that I am.  :)  But the term pagan has come to be defined as any of the following:  <br>  a person who is not a Christian, Muslim, or Jew<br>  a person who has no religion<br>  a follower of a polytheistic religion <br>  a person who worships nature or the earth, specif., one who practices a form of worship in imitation of any of various religions that historically preceded Christianity<br>  <br>  Wicca is a fairly young religion, but a religion nonetheless:<br>  <a href="http://wicca.timerift.net/" rel="nofollow">http://wicca.timerift.net/</a><br>  <br>  Witchcraft is a magical practice - most commonly associated with spell casting, but often also includes some method of alternative healing and/or some method of divination (different witches have different "specialties").  Spell casting is working magic.  Magic is the manipulation of natural energies to create desired change.  One should have at least a basic understanding of the mechanics of magic before getting into spellwork.<br>  <br>  Witches create spells tailored to themselves and their own personal needs, or personalize them for the person they are casting the spell for.  Hence, I do not give my spells to strangers on the internet, or post them for public view where those with no training in working magic may find them and "dabble".  "Dabbling" can be dangerous.  <br>  <br>  Wiccans do not believe in "the devil" or "demons", and you'll find most witches don't either - so those that are saying these practices are "demonic" are misinformed.  "Demons" and "Satan" are Christian concepts and have no place in my practice of witchcraft or Wicca.  (Though there was a time when "witch" was defined as a person having malignant supernatural power due the aid of the devil or evil spirits, and you'll still find such a definition in some dictionaries - I'm sure you can guess where that definition came from since again, "the devil" is a Christian concept.   In any case, this is not true of modern-day withcraft.)<br>  <br>  I spent quite a few years studying various religious options (including several forms of Christianity) as well as my current spiritual path before dedicating myself to it.  So no, this is not something I just "blindly believe in".  I have made informed decisions as far as the spiritual path I am suited to walk.|`|9obyO79raa	yes it's real. belief is just that. belief. Yes you can cast spells, there are thousands. go to your local library and check out the element encyclopedia of 5000 spells. <br>  it's very rude to ask a wiccan/pagan to give their spells. they're sort of a personal prayer to a designated diety(s).|`|Im9cwUIyaa	Well I don't know if it is true but if it is I wouldn't have a problem with people doing it as long as it was for good.

And No I do not Blindly believe, do you Blindly Believe in your Religion ?|`|S7XZ6KCpaa	spells are part of many belief systems, not only pagan and wiccan. Even a humble prayer is sort of like a spell. the practice of magic goes back centuries before christianity or even judaism.  You can find many references to spells and magic by reading through ancient mythologies and folklore and can see that it was very rich within those cultures. Spells are methods of generating the power of your wants and desires to accomplish something you wish to happen. They can come in many different forms from blessings to curses and hexes.  They can include invocations of spirits and deities for aid as well.|`|jqNhg4T2aa	It's a new age religion, but spell casting is a matter of your own faith and that sort of thing. It's best not to mess with things you don't understand though.
eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|OwVpiOaEaa	With how long Vampire myths go back (probably since the first flesh wound), it's almost hard to not believe in them. Your friend may truly believe she's a Vampire, and may even end up biting someone to drink their blood. At that point, she is a form of Vampire. A human that drinks blood could be considered a vampire (literally one who lives by preying on others). Humans can get a form of sustenance from blood, although it wouldn't truly be enough to sustain their life for that long. Keep a close eye on your friend. If things get out of hand, I'd try and get help for her.|`|v14DyoP5aa	She might just be full of it.

HIMwyeZqaa	Look around.  Do you see any examples of that?  With billions of people on the earth and not a single example, my guess is no.  I'm of Scottish heritage but I have lived in Texas all my life.  I think there are some difference in Texas Scots and those from Scotland due to different facial and body language.  The blazing hot Texas Sun has not changed my race nor my love of cold weather.|`|qWu5F1O2aa	HE / SHE will turn (or at least begin to turn) into a different "look". Is this so? <br>  <br>  Since your last question only implied AN individual, then no. It would take generations of offsprings to even see a change in adaptation. If you also think about it, there would have to be a migration of a lot of individuals since some may not be able to survive said climates. Hence, survival of the fittest will "grant" said evolutionary changes to said individuals physique.<br>  <br>  Anoshorahim: dude, what's your theory?|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Yes, eventually all Americans (white, black, asian, arab) will start to look like Native Americans.<br>  <br>  The whites in south Africa will start to resemble black people more.<br>  <br>  The blacks in England will start to gain white features.|`|DQZK3eKfaa	Yes I understand just what you mean. <br>  Black people's dark skin and course,curly hair all come from the extreme heat in Africa. We've been in America so long, that African-Americans aren't as dark. Like these two kids that came from our school are SUPER dark (they almost have a blue tint) compared to the African-American students.<br>  And the same would go for why Italian people don't burn as easily as say, Irish people.|`|8auEgQf2aa	No Racial Classification in the western world is based on two different categories<br>  <br>  1.Skull Shape<br>  Caucasian<br>  Mongloid<br>  Negroidd<br>  <br>  2.Physical traits (Mainly skin tone/Melanin)<br>  White <br>  Black<br>  East Asian<br>  South Asian<br>  Arab<br>  Native American<br>  Austronesian<br>  Mixed Race<br>  Multiracial<br>  <br>  Both forms of diversitys which are defined by race occur due to two genders, isolation, mutations, sexual selection and sunshine (UV-rays and Vitamin D) not climate zones.<br>  <br>  Two genders- Two genders allows a pair of genes to merge into offspring and cause the possibility of a mutant gene or genetic advantages to be passed on and dominate this us the main driving force to evolution and causes of diversity within a species as each generation is a new mix an also a probability for new mutations.<br>  <br>  Isolation- When one group becomes isolated they can gain mutations undergo sexual selection and face a different exposure to sunshine than another population causing them to gain exclusive traits.<br>  <br>  Mutations- Mutations can bring advantages and become dominant in a population while it can also bring disadvantages and become recessive in a population mutations also allow sexual selection to occur. ie Blue eyes, Afro hair<br>  <br>  Sexual Selection- When traits are more favored to be reproduced in populations causing a prevalence but not total of traits appearing within a population<br>  ie thick features of western Africans, blond hair of northern Europe and slim and smaller structures of East Asian are due to sexual selection<br>  <br>  Sunshine- The sun gives off UV-rays which is harmful to our skin and Vitamin D which is good for our skin. Melanin which is the colour brown weeds out UV-Rays and the closer to the equator the more exposure to these rays prompting more denser melanin in the skin = darker brown skin tone. The further away from the equator the less exposure but it a disadvantage due to less Vitamin D so melanin density is ideal to be little causing light brown (beige) skin tone and due to seeing blood makes it pinkish|`|AA11490975	There is some misunderstanding here.  If you are talking about why people with dark pigmentation such as Africans and aboriginal Austrailians developed that way, you are correct and it's because of their environment.  A vitamin D defiency is lethal and can easily change the skin color of humans and animals as seen in white pigmentation in cloudy Europe, Canada (native Inuit) and northern Asia.<br>  <br>  For pigmentation to change in a population today, we would first need for the population to be isolated.  It wouldn't be possible if there was a continual migration of black and white people throughout the gene pool.  This would completely offset and genetic change in the population as the genes would be more affected by the migrating people rather than environmental changes.<br>  <br>  Second, after the population was isolated in the new environment, there would have to be no medical care for thousands of years.  People who could not get enough Vitamin D could not get medical attention and would have to be selected as evolution would select.  This would cause a selection on Vitamin D intake and thus select skin pigmentation.  After many deaths within a population and many deaths over generations, we should see people with skin colors more adequate to the environment surviving with skin colors not adequate dying off.  As the genetic frequency changes, we evolve (thats the definition).|`|YMmrXvG7aa	your question is vague...<br>  <br>  well, i think it depends<br>  <br>  1. Just because an asian moved to Canada doesn't mean he/she'll look like 'the white race.' he/she may turn more white but his/her small eyes won't become bigger<br>  2. if an asian marries an american, their children will have mixed features. And if the child marries an american, his/her baby will have a more american look (big eyes, big nose, white skin)...On the contrary, if the child marries an asian, his/her baby will have a more asian looks (small eyes, flat nose, yellow skin)<br>  <br>  Is that what you wanted to ask?|`|pfke6Jieaa	lol...i know its stupid seriously. come on now how did ppl change solely on climate? does that mean that the ppl here will start to look like native americans in 1000 years? please.<br>  <br>  in the middle east we have few africans who lived there for thousands of years and they still look african, they dont look middle eastern. the scientists are so stupid and ppl are more stupid cuz they cant think for themselves. they need someone to think for them. instead of being open minded they choose to babble like a parrot.|`|GSqaUAFYaa	Yup.

GPznIhzMaa	Both are at fault. Government is to blame for not regulating the market, giving tax breaks to corporations, and spending tax payers' money on pork barrel programs. The people are at fault for spending and borrowing over their means, and for electing government officials who don't care about accountability. It's a vicious cycle.|`|b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	Both. On a grand scale, the government meddles in capitalism, (as it needs to some time) but not in the correct ways forcing social experiments instead of merely regulating abuses.

FsX5VoXKaa	To interpret what the Gospels mean, we have to take a step back in time. Looking at the curtain inside the Tabernacle, we find that embroidered upon it are the four Gospels and the four pictures of Chirst!  <br>  <br>  The curtain has red, blue, purple and white. These also speak of Jesus and the four Gospels..  Let me show you.<br>  <br>  White + picture of an Ox = Servant --> Jesus came as a servant, bearing a white loincloth.<br>  <br>  Purple(royalty) + picture of a Lion = King --> Jesus came as King of the Jews.<br>  <br>  Red(flesh and blood) + picture of man = Man --> Jesus was fully human.<br>  <br>  Blue(Heavens) + Picture of eagle = God --> Jesus is also fully God.<br>  <br>  In the Bible, we can also see from the structuring of the passages what each of the Gospels represent.<br>  <br>  In Matthew, we see in the first chapter Jesus genealogy. Here it says He is the son of David, the son of Abraham. Since David was a king, being a son of David meant one was the natural heir to the throne. Furthermore, the term "kingdom of heaven" is unique to Matthew's Gospel.  Thus we can say that Matthew portrays Jesus as the King.<br>  <br>  In Mark, there is no genealogy.. This is because no one asks a servant from whose line does he come from. The Bible talks more about what Jesus did than who He was. He taught, healed, ministered. Also, in mark we find the verses <br>  <br>        Mark 10:44-45<br>        ...and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. (NIV)<br>  <br>        Mark 9:35<br>        Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all." (NIV)<br>  <br>  Thus Mark shows Jesus as the Servant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luke has the genealogy of Jesus all the way up to Adam the First Man. Then later on, we find Jesus at the age of 12, asking the rabbis questions. This is very appropriate for a child. It would be abnormal if He was preaching to them. <br>  <br>  "Hey all you rabbis! Do you know why, Genesis was written that way? HAH! You guys dont know right? I wrote it! I know why the earth goes round the sun, i know why the seasons come and go..  And you! Rabbi Simeon.. where were you last night?  I KNOW!!  xD"   <br>  <br>  The Gospel of Luke shows Jesus as the perfect man. Perfect in His season. When He was a child, He was a child through and through.. He grew up like normal children do. And when He was an adult He too was perfect. Some portraits paint Jesus as an emaciated pale thin man.. with weak eyes and sorrowful eyebrows..  The Bible says He worked as a carpenter for 20 years. And Joseph died young. So Jesus, as the eldest son, had to take care of the family by chopping wood, hauling the log back home, working on the wood and selling it for money. <br>  <br>  Tell me if 20 years of carpentry would not give a man muscles that would put Chuck Norris to shame..   Imagine Jesus going to Simon Peter the fisherman. All He said was 2 words "Follow me." and the big, rough uncouth Simon Peter dropped everything and followed Jesus. He wouldnt do that if Jesus was thin, skinny and pale.. <br>  <br>  And finally on the cross, Jesus as the perfect man died for the sins of Man.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the gospel of John. John also does not have any genealogy because no one asks God :"Who's your daddy?" <br>  <br>  All throughout John we find instances of Jesus referring to Himself as God. For example, the people fell on their faces and worshipped Him. Notice He did not stop them. If any other normal man was being worshipped, then the Law says he has sinned. Not just him but the people who had worshipped. But Jesus did not stop them from worshipping Him, and instead continued doing miracles in the land. Only God can do that.<br>  <br>  All these are the 4 aspects of Jesus hidden within the four Gospels.|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	Both Matthew and John were both part of the original 12. <br>  Matthew was a tax collector and had records to show Jesus' family history. He tells in detail all of the sermons Jesus preaches and he points out all the times Jesus confronted the Scribes and Pharisees.<br>  <br>  Mark gives more detail to the miracles Jesus performs although the others cover the miracles too.<br>  <br>  Luke a physician... He kind of gives a disclaimer explaining he got his information asking the witnesses and tells their stories. He gives great detail to the stories.<br>  <br>  Then there is John, his Gospel expresses the Love that God has and the Love and compassion that Jesus showed. His was a gospel of Love|`|OMbXxAz1aa	Haha. it sounds like you're trying to get other people to do your Bible HW for you. <br>  <br>  anyway. I don't know offhand what your professor wants, but if you really look into each account and compare them with each other you will see that they are all trying to get at different aspects of the same story as if they are all cameramen on a set. <br>  <br>  One is trying to show the drama of it all. One is trying to show Jesus' love. One is trying to show... etc. <br>  <br>  If you need the specifics I can look through my old notes. Just let me know. <br>  <br>  J-Roe|`|opjgggqnaa	I just find it amazing that the story of Christ's birth, which is remarkably similar to that of the Pagan God Mithra, only appears in Luke.  Funny, huh?|`|WYk0zYdhaa	I agree with X's answer.. <br>  I'm a bit confused by your question though.  Do you mean how there are slightly different accounts like one noting something the other did not?  That makes sense and gives more weight to to the fact that it's true.  If you and some friends were to witness the same event would you describe it in the same way and notice the same things?  The only way one could do that is if you all got together afterwards to cooberate your stories or copy.  Since some things are left out of some of the gospels it seems more likely they actually witnessed it.  If thats not what you meant I'm sorry :)  <br>  <br>  Blessings|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Matthew- Jesus is the Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords<br>  <br>  Mark- Jesus is a man of prayer<br>  <br>  Luke- Jesus is a prophet <br>  <br>  John- Jesus is the same as....Temple purity which means one should be cleansed before going into a temple or worship<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if I'm on the right track, but I think I am...I'm curious, if this is not right, email me and let me know the correct answers.<br>  <br>  I don't think she is actually saying they wrote the books, I believe she means what are these chapters written about..what are the aspects of  what Jesus represents to each of these books...|`|wcOq60Hhaa	I think your Biblical education is seriously deficient if you think (a) they were actually written by "Matthew, Mark, & John" (no serious Biblical scholar believes that to be true) and (b) you think they were written as separate documents.  (Most Biblical scholars accept that what we have today as separate documents were derived from a common document -- most likely the gospel of "Mark" -- although there is serious disagreement between the "believers" and the "nonbelievers" about the significance of other sources)|`|vvgodUChaa	they are are telling what they saw,they have a different way of telling just like i would from the way you would tell something,if you are reading something where jesus has not died yet that will still be under the old covenant,(the law) but if he has risen and is making his self known to  peter then this is under new covenant,which he ussured in at his death on the cross, where your sins and lawless act i will rember no more and where these have been forgiven there is no longer any sacrifice for sin,they have all been taken away at the cross,hope this helps1|`|0lpXN8p9aa	It is commonly accepted that the Gospels were not written by the "so-called" authors.

4mZd0Abnaa	You have done the most that you can honestly do. Some parents never come around to accept you for who you really are. What really matters is if you accept yourself. Yes, it's hard to know that she doesn't accept you and denies the fact that you're gay, but life is short, you need to move on and live life however you see yourself living it. No one can ever change the fact that you're gay, not even your mom being in denial. <br>  <br>  Keep going strong. *hugs*<br>  <br>  MP: Neither.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	If you live with her and she doesn't want to accept what you tell her there's really not much you can do about it.  I'd suggest you concentrate on getting a place of your own where you can live as you choose without having to deal with her all the time.  Many parents have trouble thinking of their kids as adults capable of making their own life decisions while they are still living at home, as you become more independent she will, hopefully, become more accepting.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Let it go in one ear and out the other.

Ten years from now, when you've been with the same (male) partner for the past seven years, then maybe she'll give up the hope that you'll "outgrow" this or whatever she's hoping for.  I know it's annoying as hell.  It's worse than annoying- it's a total lack of support from a person who is supposed to be closest to you in the world.  Perhaps if you could point that out to her, but if she's that dead-set and childish, I doubt it would help.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is live your life, and live it WELL.|`|MKtiALuXaa	Just live your life the best way you know how. Move along and be happy enjoy what ever comes along and in time see will see that what matters most is that you are a loving happy person. What parent won't want that.

czXaUPIlaa	It would be helpful if you could define a "humanistic Buddhist" - since this is not a traditional school of Buddhism.<br>  <br>  In any case, Zen Buddhism has no place for beliefs of any sort. Beliefs are pre-determined views about how the world is, should be, or was. <br>  <br>  Such beliefs can never capture our actual experience of the moment. And Zen is about nothing but the full experience of this very moment. Thinking and beliefs won't help with that.<br>  ============<br>  Thanks for the definition. The Zen tradition views Buddha as an ordinary human being. Zen teaches that Buddha's experience of enlightenment is available to everyone.|`|AA11690436	Any beliefs in zen buddhism would be as valued as the not-beliefs of zen buddhism.

There should be something set in place to deal with this. They would know instantly how to help someone who came in off the streets requesting help so they should have no problem helping one of their own.<br>  <br>  Sadly, from our own point of view, it is much harder to ask for ourselves than to ask for others.  The bible tells us to make our needs known and if believers cannot help fellow believers there is something very wrong in our churches.<br>  <br>  I hope you receive a sympathetic hearing.<br>  <br>  Drop the words idiot and retard and you might get more sympathy here.

I would pray for guidance as to what I should do. If your heat was about to be turned off and you had small children, or couldn't afford formula for a hungry baby.. then maybe but just outdated bills ? I would never ask for something like that.. The fact that the bills weren't paid, suggests that you somehow got in over your head.. It is your responsibility to take care of that..|`|gj18ySAWaa	you can.  For instance I am a latter day saint.

Of course the church might not have it, or might decide that someone else needs it more.  <br>  <br>  But there's a long moral tradition in the Christian, Jewish and Muslim religions that strongly emphasizes the importance of taking care of the needs of the poor.

The Church says that that they use the money to pay bills and that the clergy makes very little money. I guess they didnt think anyone would ever do the math lol. If there is a church with 100 regular members and they each make at least $75,000 a year, the church comes out with $750,000. That pays a lot more than electric bills. And keep in mind that there are churches exponentially larger with members that make a lot more money. I think they can spare some money for you.

I did tithe and contribute and do some volunteer work, but I could tell the pastor and the finance guy never looked at me the same.  perhaps it's because they are men and don't understand what it's like to be a single woman in society.

Be guided by what the church can do.  He will know.  The church may have a fund to assist in the payment of bills, maybe not.  The church may have a food assistance program, maybe not.  You will not know until you talk with the pastor what can be done.  Pray and then call or go visit the church.  Churches will have resources such as counselors, social agencies and members who can and will help.  Don't start with "I need money because I gave."  Any one of the gospels will tell you that Christ had no patience with that approach.  Clarify and express your need.

Crime, wars, ethnic strife, drug abuse, dishonesty, and violence have been especially rampant during the last few decades. Add to this the pain and suffering that have been the result of sickness, old age, and death. Who does not long for liberation from the enormous problems that exist in the world today? As we look to the future, is there any hope of salvation?<br>  <br>  CONSIDER the vision that the apostle John was entrusted with some 2,000 years ago. He wrote: "Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away." (Revelation 21:3, 4) The prophet Isaiah likewise foretold: "He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces. And the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken it."—Isaiah 25:8.<br>  <br>  Just imagine what the fulfillment of God's promises will mean! Mankind will be rescued, or delivered, from oppression and violence, from the causes of suffering and distress. Why, even sickness, old age, and death will not plague us! God's Word, the Bible, promises everlasting life under perfect conditions on earth. (Luke 23:43; John 17:3) And it is available to all who desire it. "[God's] will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth."—1 Timothy 2:3, 4.<br>  <br>  To benefit from God's promises, though, we must understand the role Jesus Christ plays in our salvation and exercise faith in him. Jesus himself said: "God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life." (John 3:16) Pointing to the central role of Jesus Christ in this matter, the apostle Peter said: "There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved." (Acts 4:12) The apostle Paul and his associate Silas urged a sincere inquirer: "Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will get saved, you and your household."—Acts 16:30, 31.<br>  <br>  Yes, Jesus Christ is "the Chief Agent of life," and salvation is possible only through him. (Acts 3:15) But how can one man be such a key figure in saving us?

I'm going to try and answer from a few different point of views. <br>  <br>  If I am a Christian, then I would have to say no that I wouldn't stop his crucifixion. Reason is, Jesus supposedly died for our sins, and by doing so allowed billions of people to enter heaven. If he didn't die for everyone's sins, then there would be a lot less people in heaven. Plus if he never died dramatically like he did, then he wouldn't be a martyr, and the religion might not have ever gained a foothold, because he wouldn't have risen after his death,etc.<br>  <br>  If I'm a non-christian, then I might go back and try and stop his dramatic death and rebirth to try and stop all the billions of lives that have been lost in the name of the Christian religion. <br>  <br>  Life would be entirely different if Jesus never existed. Who knows if it'd be better or worse. There are a lot of people who have found strength in religion, and are better people because of it. There are people who have been murdered in the name of religion.  <br>  <br>  If I was currently living a decent life style, and enjoying my life, regardless if I believe in Christ, and Christianity, I don't think I would alter with the timeline. If I had nothing left to lose, then I'd take that risk. <br>  <br>  Good question. I'm interested to hear other's responses.|`|8f1i9DWyaa	No. Jesus had the power not to go to the cross. He laid down His life for us. He could have prevented His own crucifixion. He had to shed His blood as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. God's justice demanded a perfect sacrifice. There were none on the earth. So God the Father provided His own sacrifice, one that would meet the demands of justice, God is love; but God is also a judge. Father God loved the human race but coiuld not receive us into His Kingdom due to humanity's sins. Yet God the Father wanted to adopt us. So God provided a perfect sacrifice that would meet His demands for justice. That sacrifice was His perfect son, Jesus Christ, who lived in heaven with Him before the world's were created.

She is listed as having a membership of over nine hundred million church members. How could such a numerous, mighty religious organization ever be desolated, be brought to ruin? And yet it will be!<br>  Who, though, suggested such an almost unbelievable thing? It is One whose prophecies have not failed in one case till now. It is the Almighty God, Jehovah God, the Author of the Holy Bible. He foretold it by a number of his prophets, even by means of his Son Jesus Christ. Christendom’s destruction had its prophetic picture made nineteen hundred years ago. That picture will shortly prove to be a true prophecy. The reader may wonder, Why so? How?<br>  The name Christendom is not found in any prophecies of the Holy Bible. But she had her type back there in Bible times. Her type, the prophetic figure of her, is the unfaithful Jerusalem of the first century of our Common Era. Such Jerusalem was considered holy by the Jews down till its destruction in 70?C.E., and it was the type, the warning example. (1?Cor. 10:6, 11) Christendom is the antitype or the thing that was typed so long ago. Hence, although not directly named in Bible prophecy, she is typed or prophetically pictured. The desolating of unbelieving Jewish Jerusalem in the year 70?C.E. is a type or prophetic picture of the desolating of modern-day Christendom, which is likewise unbelieving as regards the Holy Bible and its Author, Jehovah God. In the spring of the year 33?C.E. Jesus Christ gave his prophecy on the desolating of the Jewish Jerusalem which showed such unbelief toward him as the Messiah or Christ. He uttered that remarkable prophecy in connection with foretelling the “sign of .?.?. the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matt. 24:3) The desolating of Jerusalem in 70?C.E. brought an end to a Jewish system of things that has never been restored. The temple that was built for the worship of Jehovah as God has never been rebuilt, and never will be. The priesthood in the family of Aaron the brother of Moses that carried on the religious services at that temple does not exist anymore. No Jew can prove his qualifications as a real member of that priestly family. The national covenant with God, established on the basis of obedience to God’s law as given through the prophet Moses, does. not exist, is not in force anymore. Truly the Jewish system of things with those features came to its full conclusion with the desolating of ancient Jerusalem in 70?C.E.<br>  To be true to type, the desolating of Christendom must come within the time period in which a “system of things” comes to its full conclusion. Inasmuch as the “appointed times of the nations” ended in the year 1914?C.E. the present worldwide “system of things” has been in its “time of the end.” (Luke 21:24) The prophet Daniel associates the “time of the end” with the placing of the “disgusting thing that is causing desolation” when he writes: “Make secret the words and seal up the book, until the time of the end. Many will rove about, and the true knowledge will become abundant. .?.?. the constant feature has been removed and there has been a placing of the disgusting thing that is causing desolation.”—Dan. 12:4-11; see also 11:40.<br>  The present “time of the end” is therefore the period of time in which Christendom will be brought to desolation by the “disgusting thing that is causing desolation.” Christendom, be it remembered, is the dominant part of today’s worldly “system of things,” and so unavoidably she must come to an end with it.<br>  What, though, is the “disgusting thing” that will soon bring Christendom to complete desolation? It is not the military “people,” the legions of the pagan Roman Empire. That empire has ceased to exist, and Rome today is the center of the most populous and powerful part of Christendom. According to Daniel’s prophecy, chapter eleven, verse thirty-one, the “disgusting thing” is something that is put in place during the struggle between the “king of the north” and the “king of the south.” That verse reads: “And they will certainly put in place the disgusting thing that is causing desolation.” In this “time of the end” for both the democratic “king of the south” and the totalitarian “king of the north,” this “disgusting thing” that has been put in place has been the international organization for world peace and security.<br>  After World War I and down to World War II this peace-preserving organization was known as the League of Nations. In the year 1930 it was plainly called “the abomination that maketh desolate” of Matthew 24:15 in the second volume of the book called “Light,” pages 89 and 103, as published nine years before World War II. But under the title of “League of Nations” this organization did not destroy Christendom.<br>  Today this peace-and-security organization is known as the United Nations, which in 1945 became the successor to the League of Nations|`|fF9uTSmpaa	becuase ppl are crazy and take their religions to the extream. so yes, it would cause less war buh ppl crave worship. without it ppl would go crazy|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	Yes, but not better off without Jesus, He is what it's all about not some religion man comes up with and twists.Satan will twist even religion to deceive and cause chaos.|`|1WisnX8naa	It would be better of without religious zealots, radicals and holier than thous...

W9LcpYiKaa	Catholics confess their sins to priests because-- as it is clearly stated in Sacred Scripture--God in the Person of Jesus Christ authorized the priests of His Church to hear confessions and empowered them to forgive sins in His Name. To the Apostles, the first priests of His Church, Christ said: ``Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you.... Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.'' (John 20:21-23). Then again: ``Amen I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.'' (Matt. 18:18). In other words, Catholics confess their sins to priests because priests are God's duly authorized agents in the world, representing Him in all matters pertaining to the ways and means of attaining eternal salvation. When Catholics confess their sins to a priest they are, in reality, confessing their sins to God, for God hears their confessions and it is He who, in the final analysis, does the forgiving. If their confessions are not sincere, their sins are not forgiven.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Catholics do confess their sins directly to God as Protestants do: Catholics are taught to make an act of contrition at least every night before retiring, to ask God to forgive them their sins of that day. Catholics are also taught to say this same prayer of contrition if they should have the misfortune to commit a serious sin (called a ``mortal sin'' by Catholics).|`|UWKF7x4faa	catharsis|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Because that is how our founder, Jesus Christ, set it up.  He breathed upon the apostles, the first priests of His Church, indicating a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and then told them "whose sins YOU FORGIVE, they are forgiven them".  Pretty straightforward.|`|h5q89E3Haa	Here ya Go!<br>  <br>  <br>  Num 15:28 'The priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who goes astray when he sins unintentionally, making atonement for him that he may be forgiven.  <br>  <br>  Mat 5:17 "Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.  <br>  <br>   John 20:23 "If you forgive the sins of any, {their sins} have been forgiven them; if you retain the {sins} of any, they have been retained."|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	We can be truly sorry for our sins--that is essential for forgiveness--but we can't forgive our own sins, we can't absolve ourselves that is a power reserved to God alone and through Christ that power was conferred on his apostles and their successors, the bishops, and their helpers, the priests, Confession was never just an option in the church, it is the ordinary (normative) means through which sins are forgiven.<br>  The power to forgive sins was one Christ gave to his apostles (Luke 10:16; 2 Cor. 5:18-20. After he rose from the dead Christ said to the apostles, "'As the Father has sent me, so I send you.' And when he had said this, he breathed on then and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit. Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained'" (John 20:22-23) thus Christ passed onto the Apostles His own power and authority to forgive sins,but why would He have done this if we can simply say sorry to God ? because Christ made this power to forgive into a sacrament.<br>  The purpose of a sacrament is to apply the fruit of Christ`s redemption to humanity by conferring habitual or sanctifying grace, two of the sacraments(Baptism and Penance) are of the dead in that they deal with a soul dead in sin and give it first justification, we cannot receive sacramental grace just by saying sorry to God,(although this type of contrition does show that we are indeed sorry) but it does not gain for us  sanctifying grace.<br>  What then is this sanctifying grace? it is a supernatural state of being infused by God into our soul that gives us participation in the divine life. The participation in the divine life is the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit,Sanctifying grace is a permanent part of our soul as long as we cooperate with its effects, but very grave sin destroys the life of grace within the soul and so Christ having forseen that even His faithful would lapse into sin bestowed the power to forgive sin(Confession)<br>  Of course it is a fact that we can ask for Gods forgiveness apart from confession but the problem for many is that they need to hear they are truly forgiven for it is a human fact that when we do wrong to someone we are restless with shame and guilt until we hear them verbally forgiving us, and many do have nagging doubts at times.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Wow, way to split hairs there.<br>  <br>  James 5:16 says to confess to somebody.<br>  <br>  John 20:21-22 says that Jesus empowered the Apostles to forgive people on earth and they would be also forgiven in heaven. <br>  <br>  So when Catholics choose to confess to a priest, they have the opportunity to receive absolution from their sins from Christ as well. Can't get that from your average joe, only a priest. <br>  <br>  And none of this negates 1 John 1:9, because Catholics believe that when we confess to God (with a priest listening in as God's servant), God is faithful and forgives us and cleanses us.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	I believe it's in one of the letters to Timothy that Paul tells Timothy that sins must be confessed to the entire gathering.<br>  <br>  Further, Christians are commanded in the NT to edify each other to the Glory of God.  By confessing to others, Catholics believe they have an opportunity to be counselled in ways to avoid the further temptation.|`|paHjJrrdaa	You know I always wondered that to! I'm from KY and there are hardly any (if any) catholic churches there.  So when I moved to Louisiana I freaked out! There is a catholic church on every corner!<br>  Well curious about these "catholics" I decided to attend their church.  It was really creepy and weird.  They pray to dead people (saints) and confess to another human as well! I was so confused! I learned from reading the bible that you confess ONLY to God and pray ONLY to God.  SO it really weirded me out! I have NEVER been back to a catholic church again, but almost everybody here is catholic so I hear alot about the religion anyways. And the use of Rosaries is creepy to.  It's kinda like the way Budda's use the their cute little statue.<br>  <br>  With that all being said, I must say that they are good people and they do have a right to believe what they wish.  If that makes them feel better about themselves and makes them stronger, more power to them.  I can only question and advise ONCE and let them on their marry way. Just as they have the right to advise and question my beliefs.  It takes all kinds I guess.  I myself prefer to stick to the word of the bible.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  As usual there are many other verses that seem to contradict this one:<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ Granted the Apostles His Authority to Forgive Sins<br>  John 20:21 - before He grants them the authority to forgive sins, Jesus says to the apostles, "as the Father sent me, so I send you." As Christ was sent by the Father to forgive sins, so Christ sends the apostles and their successors forgive sins.<br>  <br>  John 20:22 - the Lord "breathes" on the apostles, and then gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. The only other moment in Scripture where God breathes on man is in Gen. 2:7, when the Lord "breathes" divine life into man. When this happens, a significant transformation takes place. <br>  <br>  John 20:23 - Jesus says, "If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven. If you retain the sins of any, they are retained." In order for the apostles to exercise this gift of forgiving sins, the penitents must orally confess their sins to them because the apostles are not mind readers. The text makes this very clear. <br>  <br>  Matt. 9:8 - this verse shows that God has given the authority to forgive sins to "men." Hence, those Protestants who acknowledge that the apostles had the authority to forgive sins (which this verse demonstrates) must prove that this gift ended with the apostles. Otherwise, the apostles' successors still possess this gift. Where in Scripture is the gift of authority to forgive sins taken away from the apostles or their successors? <br>  <br>  Matt. 9:6; Mark 2:10 - Christ forgave sins as a man (not God) to convince us that the "Son of man" has authority to forgive sins on earth. <br>  <br>  Luke 5:24 - Luke also points out that Jesus' authority to forgive sins is as a man, not God. The Gospel writers record this to convince us that God has given this authority to men. This authority has been transferred from Christ to the apostles and their successors. <br>  <br>  Matt. 18:18 - the apostles are given authority to bind and loose. The authority to bind and loose includes administering and removing the temporal penalties due to sin. The Jews understood this since the birth of the Church. <br>  <br>  John 20:22-23; Matt. 18:18 - the power to remit/retain sin is also the power to remit/retain punishment due to sin. If Christ's ministers can forgive the eternal penalty of sin, they can certainly remit the temporal penalty of sin (which is called an "indulgence"). <br>  <br>  2 Cor. 2:10 - Paul forgives in the presence of Christ (some translations refer to the presences of Christ as "in persona Christi"). Some say that this may also be a reference to sins. <br>  <br>  2 Cor. 5:18 - the ministry of reconciliation was given to the ambassadors of the Church. This ministry of reconciliation refers to the sacrament of reconciliation, also called the sacrament of confession or penance. <br>  <br>  James 5:15-16 - in verse 15 we see that sins are forgiven by the priests in the sacrament of the sick. This is another example of man's authority to forgive sins on earth. Then in verse 16, James says “Therefore, confess our sins to one another,” in reference to the men referred to in verse 15, the priests of the Church. <br>  <br>  1 Tim. 2:5 - Christ is the only mediator, but He was free to decide how His mediation would be applied to us. The Lord chose to use priests of God to carry out His work of forgiveness. <br>  <br>  Lev. 5:4-6; 19:21-22 - even under the Old Covenant, God used priests to forgive and atone for the sins of others. <br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|VFWRdAH3aa	John 20:21-24 <br>  <br>  Some of the verses may be off but I'm just giving a little more space because every version of the Holy Bible is different from one another.|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	Good for you!

Christ does not condemn.  ALL who believe will be saved.   ALL who believe are not condemned.  The last three sentences I wrote come directly from the Scripture posted above.  Therefore, gay men and women who believe in Christ are not condemned, and will be saved.  End of story.  Whatever other requirements you may want to place on it, they are not Biblical.  Since gay people who believe in Christ are not condemned and will be saved, then God must love them as well.|`|4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	Your point is valid because all to often the two are intertwined when they shouldn't be.

I guess I'm going to get a lot of thumbs down, but the point is that God loves everyone and want us to be in communion with him, but he can not tolerate our sinfulness.

A sin, is a sin, is a sin.  Which means you being judgmental of gays as you are in this post, makes you a sinner, and it is not a lesser sin.<br>  <br>  2.  Sodomy is condemned by humans, not God and it has nothing to do actually with being gay any more than it has to do with being straight.  It is a sexual position and nothing else.<br>  <br>  3.  Being a bigot is also a sin.  And by you lumping gays in with thieves, drunks, adulterers, murderers, and fornicators, you have shown everyone you are a bigot.<br>  <br>  4.  God doesn't condone you being judgmental and specifically says it in the Bible.<br>  <br>  5.  Despite your small understanding of the book called "The Bible" and the many ignorant people that supposedly study it and live by it.  You must ultimately understand it was written by men, and therefore inherently flawed, not to mention you quote scripture from one verse, and then discard the next one because it doesn't fit into your tiny minded ideas of what the world should be like.  <br>  <br>  Newsflash...you don't get to decide what parts you feel like believing, either take it all, or none.  Christians make foolish statements about scripture against homosexuality and then overlook the ones about shellfish, killing disobedient children, stoning your wife to death if she sits in a chair you sat on while she was on her period, and stoning the husband and wife to death if they are ever in the same bead while she is bleeding.<br>  <br>  So learn something about your religion, and stop listening to what the idiots in your church tell you.|`|tdJuvdeXaa	Jeesh COOL IT with the CAPS LOCK in EVERY OTHER WORD. <br>  <br>  Maybe not everyone who believes in god thinks of the exact same god that you do.

I personally think random mortals trying to speak for God must really piss him off (if he does exist). Maybe everyone, including the producer guy, should stop telling us they know everything about God. You don't know God's intentions anymore than I do, you just have a book that you THINK was written by him.<br>  <br>  And BTW you just said God DOES love everyone (he says so in your little Bible!), so therefore he DOES love gays, although he may or may not love their gayness.

And isn't there something about "hate the sin, love the sinner"?<br>  <br>  The political climate in many parts of the US likely makes gays feel as though they are less worthy citizens because of who they are. And it's a perfectly acceptable message to tell them they are just as valid as anyone else. What homosexuals are going through isn't all that different from what blacks went through. And women to a certain extent. Basically it's a struggle for equal rights under the law which are being denied because of who they are.<br>  <br>  I'll also add that comparing homosexuals to criminals is the height of ignorance.
1BXHUjqIaa	I just answered another question about intuition (sort of). I say you have to train yourself to believe. If it's scary with the big things, start with small things that don't matter as much. I totally trust my intuition - and when my "thinking" brain tells me to respond out of habit and I make the mistake of listening to it, then I take that as a lesson to once again trust myself. <br>  <br>  And I believe that you have correctly categorized your question - when one is spiritually connected, intuition gets stronger and more accurate.

Who can know it? I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, . . . even to give to each one according to his ways, according to the fruitage of his dealings.”—Jer. 17:9, 10.<br>  <br>  That is what the bible says. The article below gives some good advice what you should do to train your mind so that your intuition is relaible<br>  <br>  <br>  *** w71 3/1 pp. 139-145 The Human Heart Is Treacherous ***<br>  <br>  The Human Heart Is Treacherous<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  OUR own experiences and the experiences of others remind us daily that one is not born with a good heart and a bent of mind toward righteousness. Despite the innocency of a newborn babe, sin and imperfection have already been at work within him since conception. The psalmist David put it this way: “Look! With error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.” (Ps. 51:5) Even conscientious parents who are endeavoring to bring up their children “in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah” become painfully aware very often that “foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy,” and have found that it takes “the rod of discipline” in its various applications to “remove it far from him.” (Eph. 6:4; Prov. 22:15) Jehovah mercifully took note of this miserable inheritance that is passed along from parents to children in His accepting the sacrifice of Noah and his family following the global flood: “Never again shall I call down evil upon the ground on man’s account, because the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up.”—Gen. 8:21.<br>  <br>  THE HEART CAN BE DECEPTIVE<br>  <br>  2 Working with the heart is tricky. If we are not careful, we become the victims of self-deception. The Bible warns: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate. Who can know it?” (Jer. 17:9) A person who is treacherous is marked by a ready disposition to betray confidence or faith pledged; he is disloyal, untrustworthy, really traitorous. Think of it! We all have, in our imperfect state, a potential traitor enclosed in our bosom! Is it not true that at times we are appalled, yes, ashamed, over things that start to take root in the heart? And when the heart wants something desperately, this can lead to serious trouble. It is vital that we make adjustments quickly, to quiet down those new affections, to eliminate those sudden desires. The apostle Paul confessed that his renewed mind was being warred against by the bad desires arising from the heart as well as burdened by weights imposed by the imperfect flesh: “I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members.” (Rom. 7:22, 23) He acknowledged that only Jehovah through Christ could rescue us from this miserable state. Left to our own devices, we would surely go astray many times. “Many are the plans in the heart of a man, but the counsel of Jehovah is what will stand.”—Prov. 19:21.<br>  <br>  3 As we have learned earlier, the heart does not always listen to the mind. There are times when the heart overwhelms the mind despite its force of logic. We must remember that the heart reasons, too, although this has to do not so much with logic as it does with what is taking place in the heart as our motives, affections and desires take shape and gather momentum in a certain direction, whether for good or for bad. David prayed, “Let .?.?. the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah.” In contrast, Jesus said, “Out of the heart come wicked reasonings.” (Ps. 19:14; Matt. 15:19) The mind is in a position to influence the heart, to make logical recommendations to it, to appeal to it, perhaps on the basis of past experience, and in some cases strongly urge it to take a certain course because of knowing the dangers involved, but if desire and affection for a certain thing have built up strongly in the heart, the heart can win out.<br>  <br>  4 To illustrate, suppose the time comes when you must make a decision on buying a new suit or dress. First, the mind is confronted with certain facts. Perhaps older clothes are getting past their usefulness or there is a need for a change for some good reason. The heart comes very much into the picture too, as there is a desire at heart to look presentable. Heart and mind are in agreement that a new dress or suit be obtained. The mind now collects information on prices, quality, styles, and so forth, so that when you go shopping you have a pretty good idea which suit or dress should be purchased. But when you arrive at the store, there in the window is quite an eye-catcher, just waiting for the impulse buyer. It is not really practical for you; it involves much more money; it is rather extreme in styling; but how it tantalizes the heart! “It’s the heart’s delight!”<br>  <br>  5 Now what will be done? What decision will be made? Will it be a practical, reasoned-out o

I believe in "God" but not the rather deranged and sadistic manic-depressive deity invented by men who wrote the bible. I subscribe to Carl Sagan's view: "The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God."|`|3b592d2cb161619b043cacf776619609aa	Several years ago I had an unusual experience concerning an uncle, a distant relative who lived over a thousand miles away. <br>  <br>  While driving my car I suddenly felt the unmistakable presence of this relative that I hardly even knew. He was more like someone I had heard about than someone I knew. It was very strange; it felt as though I was momentarily lifted right out of my physical body. I seemed to be suspended somehow beyond space and time, bathed in a love so intense It felt like I could have just disappear into it at any moment if It would have let me. It only lasted for a few seconds, but it seemed to last forever at the same time. I realize how crazy this must sound. The experience was so strong that at first I was afraid I was loosing my grip on reality. I finally managed to chalk it up to an over active imagination.<br>  <br>  Three days later I got a call from my aunt telling me that this uncle we are talking about had gone into a coma and died the day I had the experience. It felt like ice water had been poured down my back when she told me this. I had lost any real ideas of God or faith and had become somewhat of an atheist. Needless to say this experience caused me to rethink some of the conclusions I had come to. <br>  <br>  I feel blessed to now understand that even in our darkest confusion something loves us so much that it went out of its way to assist me and bring me back to a state of absolute certainty about Gods love for us.<br>  During the experience it seemed like there was a vast amount of information that I was somehow allowed access to. One thing that I came away from this experience understanding beyond any shadow of a doubt was that any Idea that God is unhappy with us or would judge or allow us to be punished for any reason is simply impossible. <br>  <br>  I can’t explain the love I felt with words. They simply don’t make words big enough or complete enough to do this. The only way I can begin to convey this love to you is to say that there was simply nothing else there. Nothing but love. No hint of judgment, no displeasure of any sort. It is as though God sees us as being as perfect as we were the day we were created. It is only in our confused idea of ourselves that we seem to have changed.<br>  <br>   I hope this is of some help to you. Good luck. Love and blessings. <br>  <br>  Your brother don|`|ki0tOVUYaa	I have a long history with it, full of formal education and independent study that came full-circle. I was a christian because I was young and did not have the life experience through which to filter the indoctrination I received. I bought into it very deeply and became brainwashed. As a result, I went through a lot over many years just to be able to give myself permission to discover what I believe by means of finding my truth, the ideas and concepts that work for me. I discovered all paths are basically the same; the vantage points and expressions are the only differences and we are free to chose because "salvation" does not depend on what we give intellectual assent to; it depends on God's love alone. Therefore, we are free to be faithful to ourselves because, as it turns out, there is no difference between being faithful to self and being faithful to God.|`|QaT680QHaa	I suppose it is close to Paganish- at one time I called myself Atheist but as I learned to let go of some things that have held me back all these years I was able to hear the call that was meant for me. <br>  Its an Earth based path of that I am sure. What I sometimes refer to as Goddess/Gods are really one in my heart and I feel it as being the Divine Purpose. Im usually hesitant to say Divine Purpose as some would confuse it with other paths and Goddess/Gods is more tangible to the minds of most. It is really hard to explain even to me exactly what I believe but it is definitely a spiritual path and not a religion<br>  (((Enigma)))|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	Don't have one.

Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch.”<br>  <br>      People of nearly every background, in every nation, have become Bahá’ís.<br>      The rhythms and routines of Bahá’í communities ? <br>  Women and men are equal.<br>  <br>      Full equality and a firm sense of partnership between women and men are essential to human progress and the transformation of society. “Women and men have been and will always be equal in the sight of God," said Bahá'u'lláh.<br>  <br>      The worldwide Bahá'í community has been at the forefront of the movement to advance the rights of women for more than a century.<br>      Advancing the status of women ? <br>  All prejudice—racial, religious, national, or economic—is destructive and must be overcome.<br>  <br>      Bahá’u’lláh gave special attention to the problem of prejudice. At the heart of His message is a call for mutual understanding and fellowship among nations, cultures, and peoples.<br>  <br>      There is, Bahá'u'lláh insists, only one human race. Prejudice—whether based on race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or social background—must be overcome if humanity is to create a peaceful and just global society.<br>      Abandoning prejudice ? <br>  We must investigate truth for ourselves, without preconceptions.<br>  <br>      One of the main sources of conflict in the world today is the fact that many people blindly and uncritically follow various traditions, movements, and opinions.<br>  <br>      Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes the fundamental obligation of human beings to acquire knowledge with their "own eyes and not through the eyes of others."<br>      The Independent Investigation of Truth ? <br>  Science and religion are in harmony.<br>  <br>      The Bahá'í teachings stress the fundamental harmony of science and religion. Bahá'ís consider that it is the same unique God who is both the Author of revelation and the Creator of the reality which science investigates.<br>  <br>      If indeed there is only one truth (reality), it is not possible for something to be scientifically false and religiously true; contradictions are attributed to human fallibility and arrogance.<br>      The unity of religion and science ? <br>  Our economic problems are linked to spiritual problems.<br>  <br>      The Bahá'í teachings envision that economic justice and prosperity will come about only when the essential connection between the spiritual and practical aspects of life is recognized.<br>  <br>      A satisfactory solution to the world's present economic crisis lies in a profound change of heart and mind which only religion can produce.<br>      Abolishing the extremes of poverty and wealth ? <br>  The family and its unity are very important.<br>  <br>      Bahá'u'lláh came to bring unity to the world, and a fundamental unity is that of the family.<br>  <br>      Bahá’ís understand that the family is the basic unit of society and unless this all-important building block is healthy and unified, society itself cannot be healthy and unified.<br>  <br>      Bahá’í writings say, “If love and agreement are manifest in a single family, that family will advance, become illumined and spiritual.”<br>      The family in a world community ? <br>  There is one God.<br>  <br>      The Bahá'í belief in one God means that the universe and all creatures and forces within it have been created by a single supernatural Being.<br>  <br>      Such designations as God, Allah, Yahweh, and Brahma all refer to the One Divine Being, Whose nature is unknowable and inaccessible to humankind. We learn about God through His Messengers, who teach and guide humanity.<br>      The Bahá’í concept of God ? <br>  All major religions come from God.<br>  <br>      When Bahá'ís say that the various religions are one, they do not mean that all the creeds and organizations are the same. Rather, they believe God has revealed Himself through a succession of Divine Messengers, Whose purpose is to guide and educate mankind.<br>  <br>      They are expressions of a single unfolding Divine purpose, "the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future."<br>      The oneness of religion ? <br>  World peace is the crying need of our time.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	I believe in Hinduism.

You might try talking to a school counselor, if you have access to one a gay services organization would also be a good place to seek advice or help, at least you wouldn't be trying to handle this all alone.|`|Vu726Q18aa	well if your under 18 she cant kick you out and if she cant accept you foget her|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Can your bigot mom really kick you out? Then I agree with Kuve. Play it low key for a while and work on getting your own place.

My loving, positive, most healthy sister....I had surprisingly found out...wanted to kill herself over being gay.<br>  <br>  I don't advocate lying but I sure do advocate survival! Do what you have to in order not to be homeless, then work on getting a home, and there will be freedom to be attained!<br>  <br>  (Survival: Be as much as you want your mother to be without shutting yourself down too much. I hate to say this, but hide what you can if it gets that bad with your mom. But do realize she may find out and prepare for that.)<br>  <br>  Seriously also. Maybe she wasn't thinking when she threatened she didn't want you to leave. She may come around to understand a bit more when she calms down.<br>  I wish you the best!|`|zRAjpm0kaa	Parents say nasty things when they are mad just like everyone else! Your mother should not have said that though! If my mom got mad and said something like that I wouldn't talk to her. I think she doesn't accept it, if you don't get a long with your mom the best thing to do is just not communicate with them so much, because it ends up in fights. Wait till you are ready and then move out and live happily ever after.|`|GjfWcWj6aa	I feel so sorry for you, i would hate to be in your position!

AA12203324	But obligation is the time-honored way of inculcating voluntary sacrifice into young Catholics.  Seriously, a nine-year-old is not psychologically equipped to equate virtue with voluntary sacrifice for no apparent reason, especially if she feels she's alone in the effort.<br>  <br>  May I suggest something along the lines of "Operation Rice Bowl", which is an organized program by Catholic Relief Services that aquaints believers with the situations of people in different parts of the world while encouraging frugality during the Lenten season and a dedicated fund that saved money is put into for donation to a charity at the end of the season?  That way she can feel a part of a group effort that is doing something tangible for a good cause.  Its much more comprehensible at that age than "no candy because it makes God happy."  Of course, everyone else will have to participate too, but that's good, right?|`|paRGbr7Xaa	Are her parents aware that you're indoctrinating their child? Issues of faith and religious practice are the job of the parents, not the hired help.<br>  <br>  Well, since the family is also Catholic and doesn't mind, maybe have the priest talk to her after Mass or something. Anyways, she's young, she doesn't have to understand it now.|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Do her parents want her to observe lent or do you?

1pFcDyeDaa	Contrary to what "sunshine" said, Christians are not destroying the sanctity of marriage "because they wait for marriage."  In fact, it's because some DON'T wait that's destroying their chances for a successful life together.<br>  <br>  Statistics show that couples who have sex or live together before marriage, are more than 50% likely to end their marriage in divorce.  Couples who wait for sex until marriage divorce at only 10%.  You do the math ...<br>  <br>  Yehudi|`|L6E6lDGKaa	Born-again Christians 27%<br>  Other Christians 24%<br>  <br>  Do you see those ridiculous stats above? That alone blows your question right out of the water. Now I know that stats can lie. The question is, can you figure it out? For instance, how do you include couples in these stats who do not marry?|`|H7L66ynJaa	Who says so your statistics do not add up to 100% We could say that Atheists and non believers represent any figure from 49% to 73% or 77% depending on  your statistics and definition of Christian.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That ignores the major and really the only data we have on divorce versus marriage in cases of couples of all faiths. And it overwhelmingly supports the Christian view. <br>  <br>  <br>  ====>  Living together before marriage has not proved useful as a "trial marriage." <br>  <br>  People who have multiple cohabiting relationships before marriage are more likely to experience marital conflict, marital unhappiness and eventual divorce than people who do not cohabit before marriage. Researchers attribute some but not all of these differences to the differing characteristics of people who cohabit, the so-called "selection effect," rather than to the experience of cohabiting itself. It has been hypothesized that the negative effects of cohabitation on future marital success may diminish as living together becomes a common experience among today's young adults. However, according to one recent study of couples who were married between 1981 and 1997, the negative effects persist among younger cohorts, supporting the view that the cohabitation experience itself contributes to problems in marriage.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Conducted by a team of leading family scholars headed by University of Chicago sociologist Linda Waite, the study found no evidence that unhappily married adults who divorced were typically any happier than unhappily married people who stayed married.<br>  <br>  Even more dramatically, the researchers also found that two-thirds of unhappily married spouses who stayed married reported that their marriages were happy 5 years later. In addition, the most unhappy marriages reported the most dramatic turnarounds: among those who rated their marriages as very unhappy, almost 8 out of 10 who avoided divorce were happily married five years later.<br>  <br>  <br>  =======================<br>  <br>  So premarital sex and divorce both match exactly with Christian teaching. Amazing really.|`|AA11946554	lol. That's funny. <br>  But I think staying married forever is bad for a person psychologically if they don't admit they made a mistake and get a divorce. They're already mentally screwy. Lets not encourage them to make it even more so!|`|5dd8eBDYaa	Outlaw same-denomination marriage.|`|zhrGiQsKaa	it is because they 'wait until marriage'.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	Many non-Christians don't get married these days therefore there are bound to be less divorces amongst them. Does anyone keep a list of how many have multiple partners, how long (or short) their living in sin lasted, how many children they have to different partners etc?<br>  <br>  Your list proves absolutely nothing, except perhaps that all people are sinners and all can experience similar problems in relationships.|`|AA10552086	The only solution to this problem will come when our society finally realizes that marriage is just becoming a big joke and a waste of time. A couple can get just as much happpiness and domestic success without the complexities of marriage. But if people want to get married, then they have every right to. (And yes, that does include gays).|`|ch9ipCTKaa	Christians from apostolic Churches that pre-date the Roman Catholics, protestants etc. and still preach the original doctrines and practices of the Christian faith, e.g. Syrian Orthodox (Church of Antioch), Coptic Orthodox (Church of Alexandria)<br>  <br>  % who have been divorced   ---   <1%|`|IYe1TTwYaa	There is no such thing as Other Christians, if a person is not Born Again they are not Christian. So lets examine your figures<br>  Born Again Christians: 27%<br>  Non-believers and other religions: 73%<br>  <br>  So Christians only have a small percent compared to all Non-Christians|`|rqwXqmyTaa	Hun...I'd hate to burst your bubble but religion does not have anything to do with divorce rates.  If you cannot communicate and reason with you spouse then it won't work...no matter if your Christian...Atheist...Jewish..or whatever.|`|wMFfGkIRaa	Stop no fault divorces, get rid of pornogrpahy, and stop trying to Murder marraige with 2 people of the same sex trying to destroy it|`|KhJwOurLaa	We should design legislation banning their right to marry.|`|pTkjGfBRaa	How does this compare with the marriage rate per category?  Is this percentage of people who have been married or percentage of entire group?  How does it compare with average of age of marriage by group?<br>  <br>  I would guess that the lower percentage groups on average marry later and less frequently than the higher percentage groups, but I don't know this for sure.<br>  <br>  I would also disagree with you that Christians have the highest divorce rates.  Not all Christians have higher divorce rates.  Note that the divorce rate for Catholics and Lutherans is the same as Atheists and Agnostics, and that the divorce rate for Christians excluding "Born-again Christians" is only 3 percentage points in difference.<br>  <br>  That said, there were some religious groups that were strongly behind the opposition to reverse same sex marriage in California, so they are behind, in effect, causing divorce.  How can we stop these Christians from destroying the sanctity of marriage?  Perhaps through education?|`|sg8gvXt8aa	Well, I'm proud to see that us Catholics are going neck and neck with the Atheists in preserving the Sanctity of Marriage!<br>  <br>  We should have a contest... who can preserve the Sanctity of Marriage the most... hehehe :P|`|l3A970zJaa	Umm... can you explain to me the difference between 'Born-again' Christians and 'other' Christians?

Other than that it was really sad that people died in those attacks, the truth of the matter is twice that number of children die every night of starvation, why didn't GW start a war against hunger? Instead of a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein. Just saying. That being said I hate to jump in to Conspiricy theories but Osama B. was a CIA operative and the CIA did pretty much start his group up to fight the Soviets, in the same way Isra'el created Hamas to fight Fatah, and now, either ,Osama and Hamas Are shooting them in the foot or as I suspect the two countries needed to lose some weight and sympathy in the international stage always helps. Not a know fact but a theory on the matter. We probably won't know for along time, it's too bad they have learned since Nixon.<br>  <br>  Ps. Incase you didn't get the reference I was referring to the tape/ learning to shush up when you should.\<br>  <br>  Pps.

Never take others' beliefs as your own unless you look at the evidence for yourself.  i have personally weighed the evidence and am convinced that there is a God who sent his only son to take our place so we can be with Him.|`|06Z3fh4laa	It's because people have a lack of knowledge in the fields that concern DNA. Besides, why can a Christian say that God is just complex for humans to fully grasp, yet, someone couldn't make the same claim, but for our DNA?|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	It seems that order is the nature of the universe so why do you think it occurred randomly?  Show me what other randomness you see in the natural world.  You see randomness and think there has to be a god.  I see an harmonic universe and think there is no need for any god(s).|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	We know that order can form in chaotic systems.  The eye of a hurricane is a classic.  Further, there are few truly random systems without a tendency.  Matter tends to concentrate by gravity, atoms form into specific molecular arrangements based on electromagnetism, and so on.|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	Because they dont want to acknowledge the existence of a creator.<br>  <br>  Thats the short answer<br>  <br>  Even for the simplest of the 4 bases of DNA to form by random chance would be a ridiculous leap of faith|`|5dd8eBDYaa	You have excellent eyesight.|`|AA11690436	Google "Fractals" and/or "chaos theory"
05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	You know your parents better than we do. If they are likely to erupt, approach it gradually. Be prepared to discuss their fears, namely that we are a cult that will brain-wash you, like the Moonies, ("Unification" and "Unitarian" both start with "Uni", and people have confused us before) and that we are "the church that doesn't believe in anything".<br>  <br>  You should attend the UU church for a couple of months before you decide to join; most UU web sites will tell you that, because most congregations know it takes that long to see if it would be a good fit.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	go, enjoy it and throw yourself in to the life of the congregation. The UU is an awesome church; the only one you can always count on to give you the grace of permitting you to own your journey. don't tell your parents unless it comes up and avoid using the name. if they ask and it becomes unavoidable, then just be honest with them and let the chips fall where they may. it's their bag if they have a hangup, not yours. we all have to own our issues.|`|44DaixVKaa	Discuss this with your parents.  Don't wait for them to find out on their own, because that will lead to awkwardness and anger by them.  Talk to your parents about religion, because they have more experience than you do in life.  Even though they don't seem smart sometimes, you should still respect them and inform them of important decisions in your life.  <br>  <br>  Ask them what they think about your decision.  See what they say, and if they support it, that's great!  If they don't agree with you, listen to their side of the story, and make your decision about religion from there.|`|Jsqlkb3caa	Maybe i am just uninformed but I thought the UU was a christian church. That is was just one of the few that was open and not bigoted and hateful. I think if you want to go join the UU go for it. And really your parents should not have too much to say. You are still a christian, still believe in Jesus and God..you just don't hate other people to do it.|`|42Z0xolvaa	show them the 7 principles of unitarian universalism, and just explain to them truthfully why you feel a part of the UU church more so than you did the christian church.......|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Tell them that your mind is beginning to work due to all the money that they paid to the university and now you are using it to make your own decisions.

aTh1nyBbaa	For the most part they are the same idea. Intelligent design allows for any deity really. It could be Zeus or Ra that is responsible for the creation of the multiverse.<br>  Creationism is more along the lines of it being the biblical God either Christ, Yahweh or Allah|`|QuaVnaOEaa	Everything has a source, intelligence is one of those things, well, actually, awareness of being alive is a better way to express what life is....life is an awareness of being alive to observe and experience the material world. Currently, scientists are trying to discover the mechanics of awareness in things made of matter, like us and so on. I never attribute my belief of the prime awareness as being the common God of all religions, but I believe that there was an awareness without beginning and will have no end....we are simply the offspring of that Awareness. Maybe we will have more belief in that concept if we discover a fifth form of energy....at CERN.|`|Ufb4XBIHaa	Creationist take a very literal approach to the Bible and the creation of the earth. Like, they believe the earth is only... ten thousand? years old (which there is obvious proof against).<br>  <br>  ID takes a more scientific approach. Proponents believe in evolution, that the earth was created long ago, but say that people are too complex to have evolved randomly. Rather they evolved 'to' something - that is, there was an ultimate design in plan. (And yeah, it is a religion position.)|`|MTuUZBzIaa	there only difference, ID is intellectually dishonest, if you want to believe a giant mystical space daddy made you, have the courage to say it. Just don't expect your idea to be held in as much esteem as scientific fact|`|7K2HVodhaa	NO DIFFERENCE. It's just religious wackos trying to impose religion on school kids under the guise of "science" (even thought it doesn't resemble science in any way, shape, or form).|`|GGGmoyNeaa	Very little,ID is merely creationism in a cheap Tuxedo. They just replace god with designer as far as I can tell.|`|KhJwOurLaa	ID says the designer could be any intelligent being.|`|sw08ARSZaa	The only difference is the name.|`|bF7yUXy5aa	The name. They are the exact same thing underneath their title.|`|e8UujnJnaa	intelligent design is creationism, despite their claims that it is a valid science|`|ORDjVHY4aa	Even the beloved of so many Richard Dawkins said in the movie "Expelled" that the first cell could have been planted by aliens.  If you don't believe me watch the movie. Obviously he is completely against Creationism and ID. But don't you think Aliens would make pretty good Designers.  Now I don't believe that Aliens planted the beginning of life on Earth, but his whole argument is hogwash. <br>  And for "science" to teach Evolution is fact is also hogwash, because the truth is Evolutionists don't know the truth, they don't agree on Origin's, and when and if 2 of them agree they still have no proof.<br>  Both Evolution and Creationism are based on faith.|`|g54tGcRvaa	ID looks at creation and existence as information.  ID itself isn't ridiculous, but actually logical when it refrains from assumption, though it's given us a lot of apologetic stinkers.  Then the Creationists came, latched onto ID like ticks to a yorkie to gain a credible wedge, and instead completely destroyed its scientific credibility.  ID is NOT Christian Creationism.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	It depends on which courtroom they're in.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	There are people in the I.D. camp who fully embrace evolution but want to insist that it could only occur under the guidance of an intelligent being. Creationism is generally a complete denial of evolution and belief that all species were created in their present forms and have not changed. There are variations between the two as well so it can get confusing. For examples, IDers who try to draw an arbitrary line between microevolution and macroevolution. In the recent Dover case IDers tried to argue that it wasn't postulating a god nor any particular god but their own statements to people and literature revealed it was very religiously motivated and postulating the Christian god.|`|qbelhflAaa	"Intelligent design is the assertion that "certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection." It is a modern form of the traditional teleological argument for the existence of God that avoids specifying the nature or identity of the designer. The idea was developed by a group of American creationists who reformulated their argument in the creation-evolution controversy to circumvent court rulings that prohibit the teaching of creationism as science. Intelligent design's leading proponents, all of whom are associated with the Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank, believe the designer to be the God of Christianity."<br>  <br>  So...nothing much...still sounds like bs to me.|`|AA11690436	According the US judicial system, nothing.  ID was found to be creationism in disguise, and the courts did not recognize it as science.  The courts had nothing to say on its validity as a religious concept, but that's not what they were asked to rule on.  Is it science, and a valid alternative to evolution via natural selection?  No.|`|pSS1xPknaa	Intelligent Design or ID is not a legitimate philosophy. It is simply a failed legal strategy to get around Supreme Court decisions and have Creationism taught in our public schools.<br>  <br>  It hasn't worked.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Not much, both are a Christian way of trying to explain the world in a way that does not conflict with a strict literal interpretation of their bible.<br>  <br>  It is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole with no knife to whittle the edges off.|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	ID thinks there is some higher power at work in making this world work not any specific god.<br>  <br>  Creationism is the work of G-d of the Bible.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	There isn't a difference. They just changed 'God' to 'Intelligent Designer'. Even the Pope thinks it's crap and that's saying something.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Nothing.<br>  <br>  ID proponents have admitted that the "Designer" is the Biblical God.|`|edOU65xAaa	Creationism has a more Biblical focus, while ID doesn't focus on one religion.|`|to8CkYp2aa	There is no difference.|`|85c6832eec366f539d7b941dc3b61894aa	The name.

iWaU76T5aa	First of all, that is true for Asian parents from Asia (like right out of Asia). I am Black and Japanese mixed and my mom is Japanese, my dad is Black. In their home countries yes Asian people do discriminate a lot but in America it is not that common, it happens here and there but if you go to a state like Washington or some place, prove yourself and you will get an Asian girl. <br>  <br>  If you are a Black male who is calm mannered and doesn't act "ghetto", you will have Asian chicks jumping all over you. Believe me, just get a good paying career and get to college and get good grades, Asian girls like that, their parents won't even deny you.|`|tYtJDXaQaa	First, blacks in America don't have their cultures. You speak English and have Western names.

Do not even think of marrying an asian girl. Find another preference and move on|`|ohUm00RYaa	Probably not but who cares what there parenst thinks.  Kids do things just to piss of their parents so knowing girls and how they behave, they will date and marry black guys just to piss of their parents|`|HIMwyeZqaa	Want to integrate some fine tail do you?  Are you prejudiced against your own race?  I understand; I don't like your race either.|`|GPznIhzMaa	I wish it wasn't true, but the older generations often clash. My parents forbade me to date black guys when I was younger (I did it anyway). One of my Indian friends was in love with a black guy but she had to break it off because her father threatened to disown her. This will most likely (and hopefully) change with our generation and the ones after.<br>  <br>  Like someone already said, the two make very beautiful babies.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	I'm Asian and I'll just tell you the truth.  I don't care what color you are,  trust and respect is earned.  I don't want my daughter with any body until she is married and if she is then I don't want to know about it because that's against my rules and if she wants to do it by her rules then that is fine but then she has to go and thats the way it's going to be.  You do whatever you want with yours and I'll do what I want with mine.   Luckily mostly boys get born in my family.  I'm religious though.|`|AA11503457	Generally the answer is no.  One of my friends had an chinese fiance, her parents refused to go to their wedding.  I never met my chinese ex's parents, which was fine since it didn't end up working out (for other reasons).|`|CvSKPHiqaa	NO. i know a black guy married to an indian woman. her parents hate him because of stereotypes. funny enough he is actually cheating on his wife with a nigerian girl|`|fKyc1ccUaa	my bestfriends blackenese. she's pretty.<br>  <br>  so is kimora lee simmons.|`|85YtzzKraa	I guess it depends on the individual person and their views on interracial relationships!|`|VEoURHoCaa	Asians( most) hate black people.|`|wh3BAc4taa	Depends..|`|j8i4kSEDaa	I'm asian, and unfortunately the truth is that the cultures simply don't trust each other. <br>  <br>  but they do make pretty babies when they do :D|`|ymrRwZr3aa	No, they do not.

Homer was just the first one to write the story down. They did believe these things happened at one time and they did believe in the God/desses literally.|`|UxooffHZaa	No. The Jewish Tribe was the only ancient tribe that developed Book Worship. (which is what 'bible' refers to today) So, only Jewish sects (including the popular ones like Christianity and Islam, who added books to worship) worship books. However, there were holy stories, like that written by Ovid in Metamorphosis. But, these were in no way worshipped, so these scriptures could not be considered a "Bible."|`|AA12346187	not that I know  off the torah was around    before  Rome  and the had the christian  bible   later   they carried it around the world.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	no; they had their own philosophers

There are a lot of adults who are very outraged and feel they have been lied to on these grounds.

Even in Hard Times, the facts don't conquer the imagination.<br>  <br>  Your brain works by creating passageways, which are created when we learn new things.  If we don't work the muscle (yes, your brain is a muscle), we don't open new passageways.  When our brains develop these new passageways, we are able to learn quicker and better because we already have those connections.  Using our imaginations helps us utilize these connections and develop them.  People with great imaginations are usually brilliant.  Think of who our great inventors were.  Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson - they had wildly imaginative inventions, but they worked.  They were on the cutting edge of science, but it was their imaginations that opened those doors.|`|ze6CbvCeaa	I searched for such a statement.

NI0cNU22aa	If your mother is a Jew, halachically you will always be a Jew. You can never "un-become" a Jew, just like you will always be a part of your family, even if you get emancipated. <br>  <br>  However, you can "un-become" Jewish by choosing to practice another religion. At that moment you become an apostate Jew, and although you are still a Jew, you are no longer a part of the Jewish community. You cannot be buried in a Jewish cemetery, counted as part of a minyan, write a holy Torah scroll, or participate in synagogue services.<br>  <br>  The conversion thing is another aspect entirely. You were talking to a Conservative rabbi. A person that he converts is not considered a Jew according to Orthodox Judaism, because of the tenets of Conservative Judaism. So really, the Orthodox never considered that person to be a Jew in the first place, regardless of whether or not s/he continues to practice Judaism, and similarly the Orthodox would never consider the children of a woman that converted to Conservative Judaism to be Jews. They would not be able to attend a yeshiva in Israel. (Actually some time ago a handful of yeshiva students had to convert because their mothers did not convert according to halacha.)|`|s1zitZMOaa	No. You are not Jewish forever. You are Jewish until the moment you covert to another religion. Judaism is a religion and there are beliefs and practices that go along with that. You can stop believing in Judaism (say you become an atheist) and as long as you don't convert to another religion, you will remain a Jew. But the moment to convert to another religion is the moment you stop being Jewish. Being Jewish isn't a race or a last name, it's a religion so you can't be two religions at once.|`|AA12245463	If you worship other gods (or a dead Jew), you become an apostate Jew which means you are no longer welcome in the Jewish community and can't be given any honors reserved for Jews alone.

Few people in these organizations were born & raised in the Jewish religion... and they are deceptive in trying to convert Jews to Christianity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Buddism is more of a philosophy than a religion, so it can actually fit with other religions. Though not all people of other religions are willing to accept it.<br>  <br>  Christians have so many different denominations and beliefs; some Christians think it's okay to be a Christian Witch, Christo-Pagan, or a Christian Buddhist, and at the other extreme, some think it is not okay because anything else is against the Bible... the latter believe other religions to be sinful, so anyone claiming to be a Christian Buddhist would, by some, be accused of "not being real Christians."<br>  <br>  <br>  So when it comes down to it, it really depends who you ask and how they define and identify themselves. If someone wants to call themselves a Christian Buddhist, who is going to stop them really? I mean, look at the Catholics; they were the only Christians and when people didn't want to do exactly like the church said any more, they broke off and started their own, which has hundreds (possibly thousands) of different denominations now.|`|ij5Sv6staa	So by that logic, Jesus' mother was jewish, so he's jewish forever, period....correct?<br>  <br>  So that makes Jesus a Christian Jew, correct...I'm sure he believed in himself, so that would make him a Christian.....<br>  <br>  ouch, now my head hurts....lol.|`|xP1xmSeaaa	Ive heard converts that revert to their previous religion or just decide to leave Judaism are no longer considered Jews because the conversion didn't stick so they were never truly Jews.<br>  <br>  But basically if your moms a Jew you're a Jew.|`|30bf34f40be263047a0e7830d4a2989caa	It has to do with hypocrisy.

A person remains a Jew UNLESS they change to ANY other faith.<br>  <br>  Only a multiple personality could be both Jewish and Christian - the religions are entirely contradictory and core Christian belief VIOLATES core Jewish belief. Could you be a vegetarian AND a meat eater? No? Same logic.<br>  <br>  Read these rulings on how someone STOPS being Jewish:<br>  <br>   When the non-Jewish world makes the claim that one who was Jewish but converts to Christianity can retain the "Jewish Culture and Ethnicity," one must ask, "Which Jewish Culture? Which Jewish Ethnicity?" The culture and ethnicity of a Jew from Morocco has little in common with the ethnicity and culture of a Jew from Eastern Europe. Yet both are Jews because their faith, their Jewish theology, is the same.<br>  <br>  And just as many people convert to Judaism, and thus become Jews, those Jews who convert to another faith are no longer Jews.<br>  <br>  The Biblical basis for this is I Kings 18:21. Elijah the prophet asked Jews who were beginning to slip into the worship of the idol, Baal, "How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the God of the Jews is God, follow Him! but if Baal is God, then follow him!" Elijah told the Jews, one or the other, not both! You cannot believe in two opposite, mutually exclusive ideas simultaneously. Judaism and Christianity believe in opposite, mutually exclusive ideas, and you cannot be a Jew and a believer that Jesus was the Christ at the same time. (See question 3.)<br>  <br>  A Rabbi in the later Middle Ages named the Hai Gaon, as quoted by Aderet in Responsa, VII #292, stated that a Jew who converted out of the faith was no longer a Jew. This was shared by numerous rabbis, which can be seen in the Responsa literature of Simon ben Zemah of Duran, Samuel de Medina, Judah Berab, Jacob Berab, Moses ben Elias Kapsali, and others in the Middle Ages.<br>  <br>  Most recently this can also be seen in the Responsa of the Satmar Rov in his Divrei Torah, Yoreh Deah #59, paragraph 5, as well as in the Responsa of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Even Haezer Volume 4 Number 53.<br>  <br>  The very famous rabbi, Moses ben Maimon, called Maimonides, also wrote that if a Jew converted to Christianity, he or she was no longer a Jew. See Maimonides, Hilchot Mamrim Perek 3, Halacha 1-3, as well as in Maimonides's Mishnah Torah, Avodat Kochavim 2:5.<br>  <br>  Rabbi Moses Isserles demanded a formal conversion back to Judaism for those who converted out of Judaism but who then wanted to return to Judaism. He demanded ritual immersion (mikveh) and repentance before a court of three (beit din). You will see this also in other Responsa literature: Radbaz, Responsa III, 415; Moses Isserles to Yoreh Deah 268.12; and Hoffman, Melamed Leho-il II, 84.<br>  <br>  It was only after the experience of the Marranos, Jews who were forced by the Church to convert to Catholicism but who secretly practiced Judaism, that the Rabbis stated that one who converted involuntarily out of Judaism did not have to convert back to Judaism. This assumes that because it was done out of force, the Jew in his heart never really left the Jewish religion. This also concerns only those who wish to return to Judaism. It says nothing about those who accept the theology of Christianity as their own and therefore remain Christian.<br>  <br>  Nor is it true in the case of anyone else, anywhere else, converting to Christianity today. In the modern world, no one is given the three choices: leaving the country of their birth, death, or conversion to Christianity, as the Jews of Europe were given by Christians in the Middle Ages, and which gave reason to this leniency.<br>  <br>  Modern Israel has a law called the Law of Return. This means that because Israel is the Jewish homeland, one who is Jewish can come to Israel, and immediately become an Israeli citizen, as one coming home.<br>  <br>  - from <a href="http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/</a>|`|TVJsOEKNaa	First there are two ways in which someone can be Jewish:<br>  <br>  A) Their mother is Jewish<br>  B) They convert to Judaism<br>  <br>  -- If someone takes up the belief in another God they are an apostate.  <br>  This means, for as long as they choose apostasy they may not (there are more then I listed):<br>  <br>  - Be part of the Jewish community<br>  - Label themselves as a Jew<br>  - Be buried in a Jewish cemetery should they die <br>  <br>  Should an apostate want* to come back to Judaism they are welcome to *without* having to re-convert. That is ALL that the statement means. <br>  <br>  Judaism is a religion, not a race -- Hebrew is a language (eg. if you're a Hebrew then I'm a Mandarin..)|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	Let me be really clear:  “Messianic Jews”, “Jews for Jesus”, etc., are **not** Jewish.  Period.  They are Christians, many of whom, under false pretenses, aggressively seek to convert Jews and descendants of intermarriage to Christianity in a way that many of us find invasive, disrespectful, and anti-Semitic.<br>  <br>  Before I even get to what Jewish law says about these impostors, consider this:  not only does every Jewish organization completely reject them as Jewish, but so do a fair number of Christian groups (see links 2-4 below).<br>  If no Jew thinks that you’re Jewish, and even some Christians don’t, then how can you possibly think that you are?  And if one thinks that this rejection is a recent phenomenon, think again!  Even St. Ignatius, of the 2nd century, felt the same way!  In his Epistle to the Magnesians he wrote:<br>  <br>  “Never allow yourselves to be led astray by false teachings and antiquated and useless fables. Nothing of any use can be got from them. If we are still living in the practice of Judaism, it is an admission that we have failed to receive the gift of grace…To profess Jesus Christ while continuing to follow Jewish customs ***is an absurdity***…[L]et us learn to live like Christians. To profess any other name but that is to be lost to God…For where there is Christianity there cannot be Judaism.”<br>  <br>  And now for what **we** say:<br>  <br>  Most Jewish scholars agree that you cannot convert away from Judaism (there are a minority who say you can convert away). However, this by no means implies that a Jew who joins another religion has the same standing as a Jew who has remained Jewish. A Jew who practices another religion, whether it be Christianity (in any of its forms, including Messianic "Judaism"), Islam or anything else, is known as an "apostate." An apostate is someone who has removed themselves from the Jewish people by joining another faith. The apostate cannot be buried in a Jewish cemetery. Nor can the apostate be counted for a minyan, the minimum of ten adult Jews (or adult Jewish men, depending on one's denomination) needed for saying certain prayers. For nearly all practical purposes, they have the same status in the Jewish community as non-Jews. The only difference is that they do not have to undergo a full conversion to rejoin the Jewish community, though there is a process known as "Teshuvah" that they must go through to come back to the Jewish community with full Jewish status.<br>  <br>  So, once we delve into Jewish law we see that a Jew who joins another religion, though still Jewish, has ostensibly the status of a non-Jew and is no longer able to participate as a full member of the Jewish community. The apostate has the weakest of all grasps to their Jewish identity, they are Jewish by birth but otherwise have no position in the Jewish community.<br>  <br>  This then brings us to a discussion on the difference between "doing Jewish" and "being Jewish." By "doing Jewish", I am referring to someone who is actually practicing Jewish beliefs and laws. By "being Jewish", I mean someone who has been born Jewish. Now, there are many people who are born Jewish but are not practicing Judaism. For instance, if a Jewish person murders a family, the Jewish person may be "born Jewish" but certainly was not "doing Jewish" as murder is a violation of the Ten Commandments. <br>  <br>  Similarly, we can see examples of this in the Jewish Bible. The prime example of this would be the Jews who worshipped the Golden Calf at Mount Sinai. These individuals were unquestionably Jewish by their birth, thus we can argue that they were "being Jewish." However, were they "doing Jewish?" The Bible is quite clear that these individuals, though born Jewish, were not practicing Judaism. The worship of the Golden Calf, though it was a monotheistic form of worship, was clearly a violation of the Biblical law regarding the making of idols. Thus, they were not "doing Jewish." Similarly, in the Prophets we see countless reprimands of people who were undeniably Jewish by birth, but had entered into apostasy by worshipping gods such as Baal and Ashtoret. They were not "doing Jewish" but "doing pagan" and had violated the very underpinning of Judaism. That they were "being Jewish" by their birth was clearly not sufficient. One must also "do Jewish" in their actions.<br>  <br>  Along the same lines, many of Jesus' original followers were unquestionably born Jewish. However, by adopting non-Jewish beliefs, such as thinking that Jesus was a god (a violation of several places in the Jewish Bible, Numbers 23:19 and Hoshea 11:9 provide a few examples of this), were no longer "doing Jewish." The same is true for individuals in the Messianic movement today. The Messianic movement was created by Christianity, and its beliefs and values reflect Christianity. By practicing Messianic "Judaism", the individual who was "born Jewish" is no longer "doing Jewish." They have removed themselves from the Jewish community by their practice and beliefs. Unfortunately, too few of these individuals have an understanding of the difference between "being Jewish" and "doing Jewish", mistakenly believing that they can both believe in Jesus and still have the same status in Jewish community as before. They not only have lost status, but also have lost the practice of Judaism. As has been pointed out in the Talmud, the emphasis for us is on the action, the "doing Jewish.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is taken from the reference section of the first link:<br>  <br>  1. "There is virtual unanimity across all denominations (of Judaism) that Jews for Jesus are not Jewish." (Kaplan, Dana Evan. The Cambridge Companion to American Judaism, Cambridge University Press, Aug 15, 2005, pp. 139-140). <br>  2. "For most American Jews, it is acceptable to blend some degree of foreign spiritual elements with Judaism. The one exception is Christianity, which is perceived to be incompatible with any form of Jewishness. Jews for Jesus and other Messianic Jewish groups are thus seen as antithetical to Judaism and are completely rejected by the majority of Jews". (Kaplan, Dana Evan. The Cambridge Companion to American Judaism, Cambridge University Press, Aug 15, 2005, p. 9). <br>  3. Jewish groups: <br>  o "To make the record clear, Jews for Jesus is a Christian missionary organization – period." (last link). <br>  o "Messianic Jewish organizations, such as Jews for Jesus, often refer to their faith as fulfilled Judaism, in that they believe Jesus fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. Although Messianic Judaism claims to be Jewish, and many adherents observe Jewish holidays, most Jews regard Messianic Judaism as deceptive at best, fraudulent at worst. They charge that Messianic Judaism is actually Christianity presenting itself as Judaism." (Balmer, Randall. Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Baylor University Press, Nov 2004, p. 448).|`|hceNM6Uxaa	It IS confusing.  Let me try to explain how I understand it.  You are right that if your mother is Jewish, by many Jewish authorities you continue being in some sense Jewish even if you convert to another religion.  If you were to abandon that new religion, you could come back to Judaism without converting.  BUT while an adherent of the other religion, you would not be part of the Jewish community - you could not be buried in a Jewish cemetery, you could not count in a minyan (that's men-only in Orthodox Judaism, but woman are part of the minyan in other branches), you would not be included as part of the community, you would not be able to be called up for an aliyah in shul, etc.  In other words, in all the ways that matter in a practical, real, way, you would no longer be Jewish.  The ONLY way you would continue being Jewish is continuing with your right to be considered Jewish on the basis of having a Jewish mother IF you wanted to return to the Jewish community.  So you could NOT be religiously Jewish and religiously Christian/Buddhist etc.  You could not claim to be part of the Jewish community and religiously Christian/Buddhist etc.  All you could claim would be a right to return to the Jewish community without conversion, because of your Jewish maternal lineage.<br>  <br>  I hope that's clear!|`|RCLVr0Evaa	it's in the same sense that you can't have a christian-muslim , or a pagan-christian.  <br>  <br>  being jewish is NOT a race, it's a religion.  there are black jews, white jews, hispanic jews, semitic jews, arabic jews, etc etc.  calling somebody jewish ONLY refers to their religion, not their race.  <br>  <br>  jews may have their traditions about being jewish if the mom is jewish etc, but that is only a spiritual distinction, not a racial one.  referring to somebody as a jew in order to distinguish race is 100% unscientific.|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	I think that you are confusing the religion with the race if you can call it that.  If someone converts from judaism to catholicism then they cease to be jewish in the religious sense.  You can only be one or the other as the two are not consistent in their belief structures.  They will always be aprt of the jewish race or nation if you will as theya re attached by way of ancestry.|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	My understanding is that if a Jewish person worships another god then they are no longer Jewish, since they have broken the covenant and thus annulled their contract with God. This is why you can have agnostic/atheist Jews but not Christian-Jews.<br>  <br>  Buddhism can be practised as a philosophy rather than a religion. Thus you could get a Buddhist Jew provided they worshipped no other deities.<br>  <br>  _()_|`|AA11690436	Yes, if your mother is Jewish, or if you convert to Judaism, you are Jewish.  However, if you make choices that cause you to become apostate to Judaism, you are then an apostate Jew.  Atheism, pantheism or Buddhism aren't inimical to Judaism because they don't contravene the number one commandment, don't have any Gods before the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  Christianity is inimical to Judaism because it requires you believe that God manifested itself as a fully human male, and you are to worship this fully human manifestation as co-equal to God.  Those are both no-nos.

Say you didn't believe hate existed, or didn't want hate to exist, you needed to eliminate the opposite in order for there to be both neutrality, because, love created hate (or vice versa, however you want to look at it.) Love is (as many interpret it to be) better than hate, correct? Well for one person to have love for someone, they needed to know what hate felt like, and what love feels like, and even then, hatred is different for each person when talking about it. A serial killer may 'love to kill' but a normal person would certainly hate killing. Basically, hate isn't bad, as it bred love, the opponent. The important thing to know is that there must be both hate and love in this world, or else no one would know what love is, because they needed to know the polar opposite, hate. This is an answer to your big question, why does hate exist. To answer your others:<br>  Hate is caused from people having distaste towards another person, usually what they believe to be incorrect in some way. For this to be true, they must have their own concept of 'correctness' if you will.<br>  Hate is not entirely harmful, it can breed both understanding (if you overcome hatred) and it can breed bad things (killings). Hate, as we see, can not always be the main reason for killings, but more as a scapegoat. The Holocaust happened, and when we focus mostly on Jewish people dieing in the Holocaust this is because Hitler used this as a scapegoat to blame. The same can be applied to how other people hate others, as it can be a scapegoat for another, far off reason. (As seen/told by schools/in schools as 'bullies'.)

vEEeq7kYaa	Some Jews are white, some are black, there are Jews of every race on the planet.<br>  You aren't " part Jewish".  One is either a Jew or not a Jew.  One's religion is either Judaism and thus the person would be Jewish, or your religion is not Judaism and thus you are not Jewish.<br>  You MAY possibly have Jewish ancestry or relations but you are not a Jew.<br>  I'm a very pale-skinned Jew, but my race or skin color has nothing to do with my Jewishness.<br>  Nazis promoted the false notion that Jews are a race.  <br>  <br>  People related to one another share genetic markers.  Jews began as a family, then as a small group of tribes and has remained tribal in nature.  However, Jews are NOT considered an ethnicity or a race. There is simply NO single Jewish ethnicity.<br>  <br>  Jews are a nation people, Israel (tribal origin) bound by an eternal covenant of the faith (religion) of Judaism. We are like a huge family and only the family can determine who is a member of it. It is the laws of Judaism, given to the covenant nation, Israel, in the Torah, that determine Jewish identity.  It is not a matter of “blood” but of self-determination through the laws of the Jewish people.<br>  <br>  The Jewish people are considered both a nation and a religion. Our connection is primarily one of faith (religion) through the covenant of Israel, yet membership is also conferred by birth, through matrilineal descent .One may also become a part of the nation Israel by adoption of the faith of Judaism and formal procedures of conversion.<br>  <br>  One who converts to Judaism is considered as FULLY Jewish as one born Jewish and their children are Jews. This has been the case since the times of the Torah.<br>  <br>  However one can be a Jew and not belong to both. One may technically be a Jew if their mother is a Jew, but apostate to the covenant of Israel and no longer considered a member of the nation if they leave it for the covenant of faith of another religion. <br>  We are Klal Yisrael, the community of Israel. . **MANY** different and distinctly Jewish cultures and ethnicities have developed over the millennia in Diaspora lands.  The Diaspora refers to the Jewish presence outside of Israel after the destruction of the First and Second Temple periods and the Bar Kochba revolt. <br>  <br>  There is no ONE Jewish ethnicity, but a great many ethnicities that are distinctly Jewish. There are the Mizrahi (from the Middle East and North Africa).The Sephardi (Spanish) and the Ashkenazi, (German, Polish, Russian and other Eastern European)that are all slightly different, even within those three designations as to cultural practices and foods, but it is the faith and covenant that binds them all together as Klal Yisrael. <br>  <br>  The Jewish nation began as a group of tribes and our connection to one another is still from the perspective of a tribal nation. (example:  as the Lakota nation has tribal procedure and law to determine who is a member of their tribe, who is not, who is expelled and who is adopted, so does Judaism)<br>  <br>  Jews are in NO way a RACE..other than as members of the human race. It is against Jewish law for any Jew to discriminate against a convert to Judaism. Since the time of the Torah converts have been accepted as fully Jewish, and this is the case in all branches. We are not even supposed to refer to the fact that they are converts! It is up to them if they wish to identify themselves as such. They are Jews, period.<br>  <br>  The covenant people, Israel have been MULTIRACIAL since the days of Torah, Moses' wife, Zipporah was a black woman. There have been Ethiopian Beta Yisrael since the days of Solomon! And I repeat, one cannot convert to a race. One may convert and become fully Jewish.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Oh sure, so what do I tell the black men I study Torah with?  That you don't consider them Jews because you think Jews are a race?<br>  <br>  You're not "partly Jewish", there's no such thing.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oh, NOW I get where you're coming from.  Typical Level I user that's probably lost their privileges a number of times.  Are racist questions the ONLY ones you ask and answer?|`|TVJsOEKNaa	What do you mean you're part Jewish? Can you be 'part' atheist too?<br>  <br>  Judaism is a religion, not a race.  There literally is no such thing as 'part' Jewish: You either practice the religion or you do not.<br>  <br>  There are two ways in which one is considered Jewish: <br>  <br>  A) Your mother is Jewish - If this is the case then you ARE Jewish<br>  B) You convert into Judaism<br>  *If you take up a belief in another God, you are an apostate.<br>  <br>  There are Jewish people of all races, backgrounds and ethnicities. There are people in China, Yemen, Africa, Iraq, Afghan, Japan, Mexico, Argentina etc.. that are Jewish.|`|AA12245463	You are not part Jewish any more than you could be part pregnant.  You are you are NOT Jewish!<br>  <br>  If you were to guess my heritage, you would probably guess Scandinavian.  Most Jews are of European descent, but there are many from Africa, South America, North American, Central America.  We have lived in the diaspora for 2000 years and have acquired converts from every people on earth.<br>  .|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	You obviously don't know about Beta Israel, or the Kaifeng Jews, etc.  See link below.  We're all different colors|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Even Ethiopian Jews? That's a stretch.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	We all come in different colors. There are white (European) Jews, black (Ethiopian) Jews, Asian Jews, etc.  (Dating now a days is awesome; we get a lot of variety.)<br>  <br>  But sometimes it feels like we aren't apart of the mainstream society. <br>  <br>  In the old days Jews weren't allowed in white Christian country clubs in America. And the KKK/Neo-Nazis still consider us non-white. But they are just crazy racists. <br>  <br>  So people regard European Jews as white, kind of. We are considered white by some people and non-white by others. <br>  <br>  I'm an Ashkenazi (European Jew) so I consider myself white. I believe it just depends on the person's personal preference as to what they want to classify themselves as.|`|8I9uduIiaa	OK, firstly, nobody is 'part jewish'.<br>  <br>  You are Jewish if your mother is Jewish OR you convert to Judaism. These two categories aside, there is no other way to be Jewish. Even if your father is Jewish, you are not Jewish unless your mother is Jewish - Judaism is a matrilinear faith.<br>  <br>  Now, you may have a Jewish heritage, and by all means it would be interesting for you to explore it. So to answer your question:<br>  <br>  Some Jews are white. We come in all possible shades, shapes and colours!<br>  <br>  There are white Jews, with fair hair and blue eyes. There are also Black Ethiopian Jews.<br>  And Japanese Jews.<br>  <br>  There are Norwegian Jews - and there are Chinese Jews.<br>  <br>  There are Indian Jews. There are Icelandic Jews.<br>  <br>  There are Yemenite Jews.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is no ONE 'typical jewish' look!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com</a>|`|Ps9eOIchaa	Jewish people do not come in one shade,they come in all.They are diverse.So,no,because many of them come from different backgrounds|`|7JAn1ISWaa	Jewish is a culture based on faith!

0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	The man was not just a traitor but worse, he was a heretic and by teaching heresy he affected those souls in his charge.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	traitor is a bit of a strong word.  Simply an atheist, is more accurate. <br>  Obviously, if that fact had been found out BEFORE his death,  His Bishop would have been justified to remove him from the Priesthood, because if he doesn't believe in God, then he isn't fit to lead the Catholic congregation on matters of faith. -- Simple as that.<br>  <br>  To me a Traitor gives confidential or sensitive  information to the other side.  I don't know how he could be "secretly" giving sensitive information to atheists?  Like the needed any.<br>  <br>  But he did become an atheist, at some point in his life. His own writings atest to that.<br>  <br>  NOW,  if he persisted in still calling himself a Priest and TRIED to continue to practice the priesthood, after he was removed,  THEN the Pope would likely Ex-Communicate him,  as a way to PROVE to the Catholic faithful, that he was NOT Catholic and no one should follow his teachings. <br>  <br>  Ex-Communication is generally the NEXT step for a heretic who persists and won't deny their heretical beliefs. It is one step WORSE then merely being removed from the Priesthood. <br>  <br>  So he'd have to insist on still saying church services even though he was a self professed atheist,  to warrant Ex-communication, vs. merely being discharged.|`|87CSe6SGaa	Well I can't speak for all Catholics but I only feel sorry for him.

Mnm35sjNaa	Here's the twisted morality that Genesis presents us:<br>  <br>  1)    Sin is disobedience to God<br>  2)    God doesn't want us to know about right and wrong (Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil)<br>  3)    God will take away your immortality AND curse all your offspring, FOREVER, with mortality, if your disobey him ONCE.<br>  <br>  If you're sentenced to death for a single instance of disobedience, then you MUST obey God or die!  That is NOT free will.  God made us human and gifted us with intelligence, then tells us the nature of our humanity is sinful.<br>  <br>  How can people not see through this preposterous charade?  Biblical sin is a tool to manipulate and control us via fear and guilt.  It puts us in opposition to ourselves by proclaiming our nature to be sinful.<br>  <br>  I reject that neurosis!  I say most people are basically good but sometimes make mistakes.  We were created HUMAN, not saints or angels.  Any religion built on denying our nature is an unhealthy religion.<br>  <br>  That's why the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have been the most persistently divisive influence in the history of civilization.<br>  <br>  You doubt that?  Just turn on CNN world news and see the results for yourself.|`|H7L66ynJaa	You can not help but sin but forgiveness is obtained with repentance.|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	Well of course we all sin, we are all imperfect and make mistakes.

QuaVnaOEaa	SETI, and other research organizations, have been monitoring space listening for intelligent radio transmissions from beyond the earth for over fifty years, and to this moment, none have been received. When I look at the thousands upon thousands of life forms on the earth I begin to believe that all the alien creatures are already here...as if the earth was a cosmic zoo with mankind being the curator. Maybe the earth is just the new Noah's Ark and the universe is unlivable because outer space is poisoned as a result of an intergalactic war ? Or, maybe, just maybe, we are the first lifeforms in all the universe .....|`|NXTpQSdhaa	I don't believe in anything supernatural because there is no evidence of it.

Why do we exist?  Nobody can say.  But that doesn't mean are lives are magical.  We can't just walk through walls or defy medical/physics/chemistry laws.<br>  <br>  I believe that although life can spontaneously come about by atoms and molecules as they discovered protein decades ago and now this week in the news they created something that has genetic coding RNA or something so life on other planets may occur.  Aliens can take form from shapes and matters such as plants they consume.<br>  <br>  But was is life?  Biology teaches us many varieties of life.  Goodie.  Now we know.  But although something like a dog can move around and instinctively knows to eat, seek food and shelter, and avoid predators, we as humans don't know if it has a soul.  Maybe a dog is just a robot.  Maybe all it does is mechanically (not auto parts here) reacts to given conditions by a process of a so-called brain.<br>  <br>  To be honest: the reason why I'm responding to you is so that you help your math friend get help as soon as possible.  He is reaching out to you.  I never told anyone outside my family this, but I scored in the 99 percentile on my SATs so I'm good at math too (1 out of 100 people).  But I have mental issues and no I am not a stalker.  I only want to see your friend get the help he needs.<br>  <br>  Back to your question: I think in mentally ill ways.  Perhaps I am the only person in this world.  And this is only a game that seems real.  I know I can think and feel.  But how do I know other people can think and feel.  Maybe this whole world is part of my imagination.  You see how arrogant I am?  Not that I think I'm the best but that I believe in my theories-possibility.<br>  <br>  The fact he is smart he is going to believe in himself.  Which worries me because he will act out the will of god or the will of what's right.  Or so he perceives as what's right.  Read my answer in that question.  It's not fun hearing voices.  You may think it's not scary but he is starting to live a living hell in his mind.  He is going to think those voices are real, and then he's going to think he can communicate to others through his mind, heck he's already hearing them in his mind.  He may think - I don't know - a lot of things: examples: he can talk to dead people, that he has a special role on this earth and to right it and do away with bad people, And when you get a hint of something is wrong, you can be sure there's more serious problems to follow.  Like abusive relationships, they don't happen overnight, they over time, and his problems are only going to get worse.  Talk to your school nurse or counsellor.  See if they care.  Hopefully they will.  I dearly encourage you.  For the sake of the kid.  He will get scarier and scarier both his personality and his mind.  You may think nothing of it and shrug it off - and likely he isn't going to kill anybody - but he is going to have a lot of confusion and mental pain anguish hate hurt spite.

b16a62ace60c833794c98d05dfd9d710aa	It is good that you have an open mind on this.  It is impossible to truly find God if you have too many preconceived ideas about who he is.  We must remember that it is God who made the world and he, not us, are in charge. As a Christian I, of course, believe that Christianity is the only true religion.  The fact that Jesus existed is rarely disputed and he is the only major religious leader who claimed divinity.  When you look at his life and his claims of divinity one can only come to the conclusion that he was either a liar, a lunatic or he was who he said he was.  Would it be reasonable to think that so many of his disciples would have given their lives for a lie or a madman?  They would have had nothing to gain by it.    Read the Bible, wait on God and you will find that he will open your eyes to the truth.  Just be very, very careful about cults.  I hope that some day soon you will become my brother in Christ.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You need to use the simple philosophical device of bifurcating questions.<br>  <br>  1) Is there a God or not ?

I mean many religions will say do this do that, but loving God is the whole purpose of that, huh? To love God with your soul, to not get desires in your way, to let go of earthly desires to love God alone?  To strive to do good with others, with not a thought of yourself? Well, that's my guess, good luck.<br>  Edit: Oh ya, I forgot to say what a unique question this was, haha!

They're trying to answer the same questions about life and humanity. Religion is no different than mythology in that all ancient religions are now considered part of mythology. Christianity, Hinduism, and other diestic beliefs are all mythology. None of it is really true. Some of the stories may be based on actual historical events, but reading the bible won't give you an accurate history of the world. It's all made up fiction, folklore/mythology.|`|OOz5ox6aaa	That really is for you to decide.

Please don't argue in that way.<br>  <br>  I'm partial to what most of the other Atheists are suggesting here.  And no, I'm not saying that Atheism is a religion.<br>  <br>  The easiest thing that you can do is...<br>  <br>  #Decide if you want 1) Religion or 2) Truth.#<br>  <br>  Yes, the two are exclusive.  Religion is the belief in something (non-factual), and Truth is what something actually is (factual).  If there was a religion that was the truth, then it would be known as such through scientific analysis.  As you can plainly see, it isn't.<br>  <br>  If 1, then read up on numerous religions.  Also, talk with good representatives of that religion.  You'll be more partial to one (I lean towards Buddhist *ideals*, myself) or a few.  It's not a bad idea to be eclectic (pick a few things from various religions and "make up" your own) or agnostic (saying that any number of claims can be true) either.<br>  <br>  If 2, go with Atheism (what I probably am).  Atheistic people follow the path that logical, reasonable, factual answers will lead to the Truth, rather than unfounded or non-factual or illogical beliefs.  There are many Atheists who have good morals (Secular Humanism for example), so don't feel that it is a "bad choice."  However, you must be warned that Atheism is the least-liked system of all (it ranks last for - "if a president was otherwise authorized, would you vote him in if he was *insert belief here*)<br>  <br>  Good luck on your search.

4DoXomHZaa	Catholic is Christian, just like Methodist.<br>  <br>  Methodists do not require a rebaptism to join their chuch. You can become a full fledged member even if not baptized in a Methodist church. You don't need to be a member to take communion there or participate in anything else. Methodists are not exclusionary like Catholics. There are several Catholic converts at my Methodist church and they were never rebaptized, some haven't even become members yet they are welcome.<br>  <br>  Baptism is baptism wherever it takes place according to the Bible. If the minister is telling you you HAVE to, he is wrong.<br>  <br>  As for your parents--you have to respect their wishes as a minor child in their home. Honor thy father and thy mother knows no denominational boundaries. They probably also realize that at 14 you may change your mind a whole lot before you reach adulthood. Once 18, if you are still under their roof, it's house rules, even tho you are not a child anymore.<br>  <br>  If you believe in Methodism, you are Methodist. When you are independent, if you WANT to be rebaptized, you can, but it isn't needed at all.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Matt. 10:37 Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.<br>  <br>  The Catholic church is a stodgy, traditionalist, empty worthless abominable bastion of Satan.<br>  <br>  Do what it takes to get baptized, and come to the true God.  You can do that through the Bible, even the NAB one.  Start with First John, then Isaiah and Matthew.  I hope you can also do it through a church soon.  Prayer too.<br>  <br>  .... unless you're just playing.  In which case it doesn't matter, so don't bother.  Refraining from empty tradition will be better than pursuing it for nothing.|`|SSsCOIrqaa	You don't have to "believe in the religion", you have to believe in God and his saving grace through Jesus Christ.  The rest is just frosting on the cake.  I don't agree with every practice of the Catholic church with all their saints, and idols, and things, but as long as they accept Christ's forgiveness and follow God with all their hearts, who am I to judge them?  I actually grew up Methodist and was baptized as a baby.  Then I went to a Baptist church and was baptized again in my 30's because apparently getting sprinkled as a baby isn't good enough and you actually have to be dunked to be a Baptist.  I did it, not because I thought God required it, but because the church did for membership.  To me, being a member of a strong church that you like is key to growing in your relationship with God, but it's the relationship with God that is the key.  Love God and don't sweat the small stuff.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	Honor thy mother and thy father. Do as they say until you leave the house<br>  <br>  your parents are probably right to stop you anyway.

Baptism does not determine weather or not you are going to go to heaven or hell... al it means is that you are publicly confessing that you are a follower of christ. Don't just get Baptized to please your sister or your church... make sure it is for the right reasons and you need to respect your parents wishes while you live with them and wait till you are out of the house to get baptized... It is a commandment to "Obey your mother and Father"|`|lywRBk4Kaa	Young man, the thief on the cross next to Jesus was never baptized.

I presume you mean from Catholic to some denomination of the Protestant Church.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that all you can really do is talk to your parents about this.  Hopefully, as Christians, they should realise that denominations mean nothing in God's eyes.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped... probably not!|`|AA11232725	Baptism is an outward ceremony that is supposed to be symbolic of an inner change that has taken place when you died to your old self and were raised to newness in life in Christ by the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  While water baptism is a command of Christ and a public declaration of your faith, you don't get baptized "into" a certain denomination. So don't worry about it. The Methodists have pretty good theology. Talk to a Pastor and see what he says.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 12:13  For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free--and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.<br>  <br>  Romans 6:3  Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?  4  Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  5  For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of  His resurrection,  6  knowing this, that our old man was crucified with  Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>I realized that I'm not a Catholic and that I'm a Methodist.<<<br>  <br>  Okay, without looking it up, what is Methodism and how does it differ from Lutheranism and Presbyterianism?

Try that. Focus, make yourself do what Muslims do...for thirty days. One month is not that hard to maintain your focus. Think of your school work.

Even if you don't get a chance to read you can always pray... pray to Allah/God when you wake up- as your walking- when your showering- before you go to bed (basically anytime to yourself) and ask Allah/God to help you to become closer to Him... I believe you shouldn't worry yourself to much with religious rituals... create a relationship with Allah/God first...do good things for your family and others...And you can also make it a routine for yourself to read a chapter or several verses before going to bed (not sure how the Quran reads) but figure out something to that example<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)... Don't give up!! <br>  <br>  When ever people do good or are getting close to God evil rares it's head to try and discourage us and try to make us lose faith/hope... So be strong:-)|`|OMbXxAz1aa	Ask yourself this question: What is my motivation for doing these things? <br>  <br>  If your motivation is negative like "fear" or something like that, it's not worth it. <br>  <br>  I believe in a God who loves me unconditionally and gave His life for me. He wants a relationship with me. God does not need me to do things for Him, but because he loves me so much and I mean so much to Him, He means so much to me. So I pray to Him constantly and share everything in my heart with Him. He guides me and shows me how to live my life. He is my savior, sanctifier, healer, and King. <br>  <br>  If you would like to stop living for religion and doing things out of obligation and start living your life for a God who is bigger- look to the God who's pursuing you and won't stop. His name is Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  J-Roe

Why, because they were both head of household or  there were no men available to do the job. The variance came in the amount of hours women were allowed to work. The same was true of teenagers--many youngsters went to work when they completed the eighth grade.<br>  <br>  Per hour pay was set by the government in war industries. Male or female, that's what was paid.|`|n5TYFgETaa	remember, before WW2, women were considered to be stay at home moms, it wasn't even considered that they would be able to do 'men's work'.  Rosie was a sign..an ideal, perhaps even a role model brought forth by the government to show that it was encouraged to do such work.|`|bMaa3bk2aa	Psshhyaahhh she was.<br>  Back in those times, the women were just expected to sit home, take care of the kiddies, cook dinner for the men, and clean up after everyone and everything. they were supposed to be a perfect housewive, they had dreams of course, like any human did, and well, they weren't allowed to fufill them and take on a career, only the men were. rosie, however, encouraged the woman, they decided they should be EQUAL with the men, not below them.<br>  so yes, it was about working.|`|9c244bfee8268997c7b51bbd821a11f2aa	it was about them working.  equal pay was not even considered for decades later.

I would suggest you taking them to good and interesting Islamic classes. There are a lot of upcoming and excellent preachers for young people that help them stay away with their persuasiveness and reality of their words. Another think I would so is let them read the Qu'ran; to put it simply, it cleanses the soul and reminds you of what you are. If all fails, a muslim psychiatrist will help.|`|lqzRE7QTaa	accept them just the way they are,<br>  just because they are gay doesnt mean you should love your own child any less, and if you do you're a terrible person.

hj6XcV3Taa	It depends on what is said to you. I don't think there are many good comebacks that would perfectly fit any one insult. All the guy's in my year just say: 'You're Mum' and that's their only comeback which is the worst comeback I have ever heard to be honest. <br>   You could always just insult them back, it really depends if you're doing it as a joke with a friend or it is someone who you really despise because you could pick on the appearance if you don't like them but if it's a genuine friend this may be slightly harsh.<br>   So give me an insult and I'll try and come up with a witty comeback.

Tell them that everyone behind their back talks about.....( insert something here ) like how gay they look or how their hair is horrible or they dress bad or how dumb they are.<br>  <br>  Oh and throw in that everyone only pretends to be their friend so they have someone in the group to make fun of.|`|5R3oVfisaa	u need to tell me what you are trying to comback to. like what did the person say to you? cuz that is specifically required for what you are going to say back to him.|`|rThIVk2maa	Avoid conversations with people who make you want to use a comeback.

The ancient Egyptian civilization lasted 3000 years, and you can imagine there were many changes in that time.  I have read that everyone went barefoot, that sandals were only for the Pharaoh, but other places I've read that everyone wore sandals, so it might have been different at different times.<br>  <br>  The Egyptian civilization was very 'rich' so they had a lot of artists.  I think most people wore pendants with hand-carved amulets, and necklaces with glass beads (they made beautiful glass beads!)  They had bracelets, rings, anklets, etc.  They wore wigs that were raised from the scalp to let air flow under them.  The Pharaohs wore stylized false beards, including the female ones.<br>  <br>  Men and women alike wore short skirts (like kilts).  Women often went topless, in fact children under a certain age just went naked.|`|AA10067344	Mostly they wear bandages and burial masks.|`|qGVBxZZOaa	Look it up

qS8pxDhKaa	Latvian has it's origins in a hypothetical Indo-European language which some linguists call Proto-Balto-Slavic. It was spoken around 2000 B.C. in the territory that is now the country of Lithuania. Around 1500 B.C. Proto-Balto Slavic split into separate Proto-Slavic and Balto-Slavic groups. Proto-Baltic in turn, would later split into three new languages: Latvian, Lithuanian and Old Prussian (also called Borussian). <br>  <br>  Throughout most of history, the Latvian (or Lettish) language was unwritten. The oldest writing that exists in Latvian is a Catholic Catechism from the 16th century. <br>  <br>  While Latvian and Sanskrit are not mutually intelligible, Latvian is cetainly one of Sanskrit's closest living relatives outside of India and southwestern Asia. For example Sanskrit aksi "eye" compares closely with Latvian acs and Lithuanian akis; Sanskrit avih "sheep" is very similar  to Lat avs and Lithuanian avis but the English cognate "ewe" is further removed. <br>  <br>  Nevertheless, linguistic facts must be kept separate from anthropological facts. While the Latvian people speak a language that belongs to the Satam branch of Indo-European like Sanskrit the Latvians are still not "Aryans" or "Indo-Europeans." Modern genetic testing indicates that they are closely related to the Livonians and the Finns, both Uralic peoples. So, Latvian is clearly an example of a language where the original speakers have disappeared but the language lives on in the speech of a foreign people who adopted their language. It is also quite possible that the original Indo-European speakers of Latvian lived more in what is now Lithuania than in Latvia. <br>  <br>  The Latvian language also contains many loanwords from Finnish and Livonian which are absent in it's sister language Lithuanian.|`|Tn1bMQ3Aaa	Latvian has its roots in the Proto-East-Baltic languages<br>  <br>  These links has a lot of useful information on the language..

O6Hc7OFoaa	Actually yes, that does seem REALLY strange....but raising chickens is alot of fun! It will soon be time to get chicks, ducks, turkeys other feathered friends too....I especially love my ducks and geese, they are more friendly then the chickens. Its a very odd thing to ask for , for a birthday gift, but it sounds like you have all the indoor stuff, get yourself OUTside!!!!! Even if you cant get chicks yet.....have a place set up with a heatlamp, protection from the weather, waterer, feed.... you can get chicks locally soon from a feed store, ( Im sure you can, you surely dont live in a big city! ) . But its fun to look online at hatcherys, I once bought a "box" full ( there are minimums on how many to buy) , check out  www.mcmurrayhatchery.com<br>  Update a few minutes later...An Ipod for a 13th birthday? Maybe sweet 16, but unless your parents have really good jobs, thats a big $$$$ order to fill! Alot of us parents are currently unemployed, which explains why Im sitting here answering questions all day. LOL , anyway, my kids will have to wait for a better financial situation in our own household before I could afford that. Right now they are upset they have to wait for Rockband ( star) for the WIII, which was their combined Christmas gift, and was more then I could really afford! Darn charge cards!|`|ItS4VZrEaa	I love chickens too! lol<br>  Ask for a chicken its worth a try, i did :o)<br>  Or mayeb you could get an ipod?<br>  Computer?<br>  Eggs?|`|82FuhGKaaa	I love chickens too.

6Whz1p5Eaa	Wow, you are way overdue for reading the Bible! Go ahead and crack it open, it won't hurt!<br>  <br>  Why don't you start with the Gospels, where Jesus shows compassion and acceptance to women who had made mistakes in their romantic life.|`|AA11923447	Yes, they should be allowed in church. As should everyone. What part of Christ's commandment to love our neighbors includes ostracizing them and acting like holier-than-thou bigots toward them?|`|AA11232725	It all depends upon the church and what the Elders of the church say. Different churches have different standards. Also, it depends upon what the woman has already done. Maybe she slipped up and got pregnant out of wedlock, is sorry for her sin, and is having the baby despite the attendant shame. <br>  <br>  Now as to her singing in the choir and the father being a married man, that's going a little beyond what most churches would tolerate. It's one thing to welcome a repentant sinner back into the fold, it's another thing to parade her sin in front of the congregation and if adultery is involved then there should be some church discipline going on.<br>  <br>  If the Pastor and the Elders know that this woman is an adulteress then there is no way that she should be singing in the choir. I would question the leaders of a church who treated sin in so lightly a manner.|`|THRtsl83aa	Do you know for absolutely sure that she just slept with a married man?  There is an off chance she was raped or something, perhaps she is keeping the child.  Either way, though, I don't know that kicking her out is a good way to help bring her closer to Jesus.  Perhaps she has asked for forgiveness for her sins already - you don't know.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	First of all, Number One is the Baby. Secondly, if it isn't your direct business you are doing wrong and acting foolishly. <br>  <br>  Pray for that situation but do none of the things you seem to be contemplating. No whispering campaign, no church-dividing tactics.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	John 8:7 " So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." She isn't perfect ...are you ?  What if that was you ?|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Hmmm.  Thank goodness the people of Nazareth didn't stone a certain unwed mother named Mary.|`|xNaN3VkJaa	Everyone of us is a sinner. So not to "tolerate" her would be hipocracy. I think she should be more than tolerated, she should be loved and supported during this time. Encouraged that she is doing the right thing by deciding to keep the baby and taking responsibility for her actions. You do know that you are no better than her, don't you. Sin is sin in God's eyes, but a pregnancy is a little more evidence of sin than some people are willing to tolerate. I guess the man wouldn't be snubbed, simply because he can't get pregnant. That's a double standard. This is exactly the reason that people think Christians are hypocrites. Oh, and one more thing, the baby she is carrying is not the sin, the sex was. But all things work together to good for those that love the Lord, even if their pregnant.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	I believe the woman should not be judged, as in talked about, snubbed, being treated rudely and such, but I do see your point. If she holds a position in the church then she is held to a higher standard and her actions should be a honorable reflection on God.<br>  <br>  If I were you however, I would not do anything to insult her, or degrade her; just pray about it and ask God to deal with the situation Himself, then just go about loving her as if she had done nothing wrong.|`|yoKHoKXjaa	AWW, what a precious, loving, accepting, caring Christian you are.|`|89MKzLl3aa	What can of example would a Christian be setting to not accept someone in their church? That is something a Pharisees would do.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	Sounds as though you're ready to cast the first stone.|`|AA11340890	Doesn't Christ teach tolerance?  Why would you have EVER kicked people out of your church?|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Church is for ANYONE who wants to go|`|AA10719818	Church isn't for perfect Christians.  Church is for the people who make mistakes and need God's help.<br>  I'm very shocked at your question.  This is a girl who clearly needs the church, and you want to shun her.<br>  You don't know how she feels.  maybe she is putting on a brave front and seeks the guidance of the pastor in private.<br>  You say you heard the father is married.  Christians don't entertain gossip, and don't judge.  She is what the church is made for.  We all fall short, and maybe she needs friends, and forgiveness right now.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Please think about offering her a hand, or at least an ear, instead of harboring these negative feelings you have.  Shunning her will only help her fall farther from grace.<br>  <br>  God bless!|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	Well, I am quite surprised that you find it unacceptable for her to be in church.  Being a Christian and a church member  is about accepting others and forming a community around your members with support.  That does not mean you condone her choices by any means, but I am certain that you know there are Bible passages telling you it is a sin to judge others, so how do you rationalize doing so? I would prefer to be a member of a congregation such as the one you describe, than one who would not accept a woman who obviously loves Jesus and wants to be a good person.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	"Tolerated?" Did you really use that word? It's people like you who make Christians look like they are judgmental and unforgiving. You don't even know the whole story. You are just going off of gossip and rumors you have heard. 100 to 1 if you kick her out of your church she will never go back to any church let alone bring her child to one. How about you get off your high horse and get to know her and see if she needs help?|`|macZI2dzaa	Absolutely not.  they should be warmly welcomed, not just tolerated.  As God provides opportunity though, every church should counsel young adults against risky behavior that leads to single parent homes.  There is almost no greater damage to children than that which comes through single parent homes.  Not necessarily the single parents fault, but an enormous percentage of children from single parent homes end up incarcerated.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	It's people like you who push people away from God.  This reminds me of Rick Warren and his "church" which does not allow gay people to become members.  As Christians, it's not up to us to judge others, that's God's job.  Our job is to lead people to Christ and then let Christ take it from there.  I suggest you worry about your own sins and stop throwing stones and stirring up discord.|`|DiIAaFgzaa	She should certainly be allowed to remain in church.  But I don't think she should be doing anything right now that could be interpreted as a leadership role.<br>  <br>  Jesus came to save the sinners.  All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  So she is one of the people Jesus came to save.  If we're honest, all of us are sinners.|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	Was Mary, mother of Jesus, married when she gave birth.<br>  And was the man who raised Jesus his biological father?<br>  <br>  If your a Christian, then you should be answering no on both counts.<br>  And that should help you find your answer.|`|m29eEm57aa	yes, that way when they leave the service we can be waiting outside with rocks . . . . .  <br>  isn't that what we are supposed to do?|`|ojiO3svoaa	REALLY? F******* REALLY?|`|ykIleAQ7aa	I'm not a Christian but damn, wouldn't casting her away be more unchristian like? Its not up to YOU to judge her for her actions. So to cast her away is just not right. Its actions like that, that make people not like Christians. Doesn't she need Jesus too? My friend is unwed and is very active mother of 2 in her church. She teaches Sunday school to the kids, but when she started to show the pastor asked that she not teach until after the baby. She participates in the choir, in fact she is one of the leads. Her pastor knew the hardships she was facing and he embraced her and helped her, she has always been very active in church, he would never push her away just because she had a child out of wedlock.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Oh how can you forgive such tolerance! Stone her or something! <br>  <br>  But really she is not making a mockery of anything. You however come of as well... a dick|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Yes, more than tolerated...  In fact, it's those who think not that are the hypocrites whom Jesus despised.|`|AA11466759	so you would rather the woman who had aborted her child sit beside you in church.|`|Yzcptoagaa	You are vicious.|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	Maybe she's one of those "least" people Jesus warned you about in Matthew 25:34-40.|`|casg30Ataa	Oh my god, leave her alone.<br>  Why dont you just do what the bible says and stone her?|`|8UqDCPjRaa	Did Christ come to seek and save the lost?  Did He come to call the righteous or the sinners to repentrance?<br>  <br>  I think you should stop gossiping about her.  You are sinning just as much as she is.  Remember the Bible says if you are quilty of 1 sin you are guilty of all.<br>  <br>  You should be protecting her from the gossip of others. You should be surrounding her and her baby with love- they will need it.  You should be planning her baby shower.  How will she and her dear baby know the love of Christ if you don't show her?<br>  <br>  Church is the very best place she could be!!! Being pregnant is not a sin.  Yes, fornication is, but have you considered that she might have repented?  Have you considred that Christ died to pay for her sin because He loves her?<br>  <br>  I think you need to ask yourself if you are really saved.  No one is righteous enough to meet God's standards.  He loved us enough to die for us even though we sin.  It doesn't seem that you understand this.<br>  <br>  If you would like to know more about grace and salvation email me.  I don't want to see YOU go to hell!|`|AA11346514	Do you know that the father is married or have you only listened to gossip?  Do you truly know the young lady?  Could it be that she is living alone because her husband is serving his country?  It is said that you should "judge not that ye be not judged.  For by such judgment as ye judge, so shall ye be judged."  Christ indicated that we should cast the log from our own eye before we griped about the mote in another's.  Are you then so perfect that you can condemn another.  May God bless you and give you peace.|`|L81GyNmjaa	God loves everyone in the world. He shows compassion especially to sinners, which excludes no one (meaning if that woman is kicked out, you and everyone in your church who advocated for that action must be kicked out also). Do not prevent anyone from knowing the Lord. That is a sin.|`|QIjmPzVCaa	You would have a point if we lived in the eighteenth century, but doesn't the church teach us now that good christians should value forgiveness? and we're not in a position to judge anybody--that's up to God.  and if God is letting her participate in church then don't question it.  be nice to her! we're supposed to be kind to other people.|`|b8f5bc89c528383d165158426b57b42faa	Yes, I think she should be tolerated, and helped. What would Jesus do? Is church only for people without sin? If so, I doubt if there could be anyone that could walk through the doors. Please do not listen to gossip and judge her, she's the only one who really knows who the father is. At least she didn't have an abortion.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	And what exactly is the church supposed to represent......that only saints can go there. No....   Jesus didn't hang out with the ones that felt like they didn't need Him..He hung out with the sinners. <br>  We are not supposed to judge people for their actions. That is Gods job. Hopeefully she can find a good support system in the church and raise her child in the way it should go so that it will not stray from it.|`|eaP3XMSaaa	no it is not right for us to judge other people.... who knows how she got pregnant maybe the man raped her you don't know. remember what Jesus said when they were about to stone the woman who committed adultery. "if any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." read john 8 1-7|`|xU0xtg2zaa	Shes a mammal, what is she supposed to do, sign a piece of paper? <br>  <br>  oh, i see..... signing a legal document means something in a spirtual, heavenly father.

As long as she asks for forgivness and really means it then I believe God will. But as long as she doesn't encourage young girls and show them how hard it is then i believe it is fine.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Being a tad judgemental there, not very christian of you is it?

Although Jesus don't like sin he is well aware that all have sinned. Jesus is the only one that has the right to throw any stones. he did not throw stones at the woman that committed adultry. You need to find the love of Jesus in your heart and give her a big hug. Otherwise I think you should resign yourself from the church yourself. You definitely are not acting Chrstian like. I am not Catholic but one thing catholics have done is support unwed Mothers which is more than anyone can say about anybody calling Catholics a cult|`|8a2ebc183110448f4c3847d3aa539174aa	I think that its wonderful that the other parishioners and the minister are accepting of her. She is obviously making an effort to participate in Church activities. Its my understand that Jesus taught of love and tolerance for all others. <br>  <br>  What you are doing is passing judgement on her based on gossip and here-say. Even if you are right, and the child has been fathered by an unmarried man, that is not really any of your concern. That is between the man, the woman and God. There is no need for you to pass judgement.<br>  <br>  Instead of worrying about her being a bad example for younger girls, I think it would be more helpful for you to focus your energy on being a good role model yourself. <br>  <br>  Life is too short to be spending time making yourself miserable over the actions of others that have nothing to do with you.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|ggwsClQBaa	They should most definitely be accepted. That mother has one of the hardest jobs, and her strong faith should be admired. Single mothers are very brave.|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	Well, she made a mistake. We all make mistakes, and God is a forgiving Lord. Now when reading this, I thought it wasn't a big deal. But then I got to the part with the married man. Wow! That's bad. But she may have been raped...but assuming she wasn't, I think she made a very bad, and wrong choice, but it was just a mistake. And like I said, God forgives. At least she is not getting an abortion. I don't think the church should throw her out. She needs the church so she can repent and not make these mistakes again. Having the church turn away from her will just ruin her.|`|CEQpDpnPaa	he who is without sin cast the first stone<br>  <br>  Jesus came to save the sinners not saints<br>  <br>  He ate with the sinners and tax collectors not the religious leaders<br>  <br>  read Mathew 9:12|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	Get real Jesus loves us all and He would never kick her out of His house, if all that sinned were kicked out, the Church would be empty.|`|Fxp5Owfwaa	Those kinds of thoughts are what give Christianity a bad wrap.

I am a christian, attend church, and love God, and I do not believe He would want her shunned out of church.

His only change is in his amount of anger and vehement retribution.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Although it's supposedly characteristic of the epic genre that its characters are static, i. e. that they don't change, in fact in most epics they do.  Achilles certainly does, and to a great extent we can trace the changes in him by the changes in the target of his wrath--the key word of the Iliad--and in his concept of honor.<br>  <br>  Book 1 -  Achilles angry with Agamemnon; external sense of honor;   self-centered reaction <br>  <br>  Book 9 - still angry with  Agamemnon, but  thinking of leaving the war altogether and trying to change the choice he made as a boy-- between a short, heroic life and a long, uneventful one.   <br>  <br>  Next few books - feeling concerned about his comrades;  allows Patroclus to wear his (A's)  armor and lead  hs men into battle; seems to forget he asked Zeus to let Trojans win for a while.<br>  <br>  Book 18 & following - Hector kills Patroclus; focus of A's anger changes from Agamemnon to Hector--ready to rush into battle immediately, if  Hector hadn't taken his armor off Patroclus.  (Also, though Homer doesn't explicitly say so, now angry with himself for letting P. by killed)<br>  <br>  Books 21 & 22 - Achilles is warned twice before he returns to battle that he is fated to die soon (or maybe next) after Hector, but shrugs it off  both times--seems to feel that he owes it to Patroclus to avenge him even at the cost of his own life; sense of honor becoming more internal--no longer  reflected in the respect others show him but in whether he can face himself.<br>  <br>  Books 22-24 -  Achilles still angry with Hector--easiter than facing anger toward himself; abuses Hector's dead body and deny it burial--attempt top deny Hector entry to Underworld and eternal rest; gods  becoming fed up with Achilles, send his mother is sent to warn him that it's time to let go..<br>  <br>  Book 24 - Priam arrives in the dead of night to offer ransom for Hector's body; Achilles' anger apparently burned out--maybe reflecting  that he can expect to face whatever judgment there is in the next world very soon; sense of honor seems now focused on doing the right thing in his own eyes and those of the gods; able to empathize with Priam--after all, his own father may soon be seeking HIS body for burial.<br>  <br>  So, not exactly a static character!

You are harming yourself and maybe others. However, having sex with someone you love, regardless of marriage, doesn't seem harmful to yourself or others. The purpose of Christian morality is to cause the least amount of harm and promote the most amount of good.

OUbNSXjJaa	There is no need to covert. One who follows righteous life is considered a Hindu. One who believes that there is something above us (who operates, balances and neutralizes every happening) is a Hindu. One who knows what is discipline and orderliness is a Hindu. One who is organized and systematic is a Hindu. One who recognizes that every thing and being in the universe is equal and deserves to be given due place and respect. For Hindus, therefore, every thing and being is a form of God. For them a plant, a tree, an animal, a river, an ocean, a hill - like that any thing is considered sacred. <br>  <br>  This is in brief. If one tries to follow the above, he is considered a Hindu.|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	Hello  i am a Hindu.<br>  <br>  Ok first off you should look at more spiritual aspects or branches of you own religion before you make a decision to convert to Hinduism.

It is very easy for someone not familiar with the tradition to misinterpret it and present false distortions, so you should make sure that the information you get comes from experienced practitioners of the tradition itself.  There are numerous sages in the Hindu tradition from relatively recent times who have written very good works on Hinduism, like Swami Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Sri Aurobindo, and others, and these are the types of things you would benefit from reading.  Professors and academicians usually are looking at the Hindu religion from a western or other biased perspective, which cannot understand a religion and culture as complex and multi-faceted as Hinduism and India.

The name (Hindu) itself was given by the people who were living north of Sindhu river now known Afghanistan & Iran as "Sindhus"  to denote the people living in the south of that river which in due course changed to Hindu. It is religion of agglomerating 6 different religions namely Ganapathiyam (God Ganapathi / Vinayaka), Saaktham (God Shakthi),  Souravam (God Sun), Saivam (God Shivam), Vaishinavam ( Narayanan), Goumaram ( God Murugan). Many more Gods and forms are also available with some philosophy to get benefits in the psychological manner. <br>  The religion is a offshoot of Dravidian & Aryan culture.<br>  It is a religious path to realize The God and live in a virtuous way of life only. The religion got two different path. One is Bakthi Margam which is for ordinary undeveloped mind and another one is Gnana Margam for developed mind people like you.<br>  In the second one it is meditation and introspection are the gift to follow. You choose your own type and meditation & introspection and realize the God.

AA11232725	Acts 11:26  And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	It says that at Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.|`|atfKCzmPaa	*** w00 7/15 pp. 25-26 Persecution Sparks Growth in Antioch ***<br>  <br>  Called Christians by Divine Providence<br>  <br>  For a whole year, Barnabas and Saul “taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.” It is unlikely that the Jews were the first to call Jesus’ followers Christians (Greek) or Messianists (Hebrew), for they rejected Jesus as the Messiah, or Christ, and therefore would not tacitly recognize him as such by calling his followers Christians. Some think that the heathen population may have nicknamed them Christians in jest or out of scorn. The Bible, however, shows that the name Christians was God-given.—(Acts 11:26---"and, after he found him, he brought him to Antioch. It thus came about that for a whole year they gathered together with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.")<br>  <br>  In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the verb used in connection with the new name, generally translated “were called,” is always associated with something supernatural, oracular, or divine. Scholars thus render it “to utter an oracle,” “divinely intimate,” or “to give a divine command or admonition, to teach from heaven.” Since Jesus’ followers were called Christians “by divine providence,” it is possible that Jehovah directed Saul and Barnabas to give the name.<br>  <br>  The new name stuck. Jesus’ disciples could no longer be mistaken for a sect of Judaism, from which they were quite distinct. By about 58?C.E., Roman officials knew very well who the Christians were. (Acts 26:28--"But Agrip′pa said to Paul: “In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.”) According to the historian Tacitus, by 64?C.E., the name was current among the masses in Rome too.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	Only from the people who are followers of Christ did the word Christian came from the same way as the Buddhist who follow the path of life of the Buddha.<br>  The Bible specially the New Testaments, call these people followers of God as taught by their leader named Jesus Christ.|`|vvgodUChaa	when you beleive by faith in the finished work of christ on the cross,where he died and was burried and on the third day rose again, then he god gives you the right to be called a child of god it in the new testment read all.hope this helps!|`|DiIAaFgzaa	Acts 11:26 and Acts 26:28<br>  <br>  The term was first used in the derogatory sense, a name used to ridicule believers in Christ.

Though, if you are a Christian... you certainly are saved... but just because you are saved, that does not mean you are a Christian.<br>  <br>  To be a Christian, we must have a walk WORTHY of the Gospel of Christ.  If we do not... then we will most definitely be an example of God's mercy, in salvation nevertheless, but to call oneself Christian and not follow Christ... is a lie.  Just because you are saved, and following Him to heaven, ultimately, does not mean you are living a life worthy of the Gospel.<br>  <br>  Christian, is a term that *should* be used to describe those who are obeying God's Word.

Where in the Quran does it say that being gay is wrong or sinful? <br>  <br>  When I came out I went through the exact same things as you, until I started questioning every thing that I was being told. I realized that the Quran does not condemn homosexuality, rather it all stems from patriarchal values of the culture Islam started in. <br>  <br>  Actually the Quran acknowledges that there are men who are not attracted to women. Consider the following verse:<br>  <br>  "And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts and do not display their ornaments except what appears thereof, and let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms, and not display their ornaments except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their right hands possess, or the male servants not having need (of women), or the children who have not attained knowledge of what is hidden of women; and let them not strike their feet so that what they hide of their ornaments may be known; and turn to Allah all of you, O believers! so that you may be successful. " 24:31<br>  <br>  See the part where it talks about "male servants" not having sexual needs for women. I believe that would include gay men as well. Allah tells us that he has created mates for us who can satisfy all our desires. "And one of His signs is that He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest in them, and He put between you love and compassion; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect." (30:21) This verse does not say that only mates of the opposite sex were made. For a gay man, such a mate is only that of a same-sex.<br>  <br>  Email me if you have more questions. I have written more about this.|`|vg3ih0foaa	First of all, don't give up. It's not the end. Dealing with homosexuality can be very difficult, take it from me, and it can feel like the end of the world. First of all, find Allah in your heart. Do you really think any true merciful God could hate love? No matter what kind? Love is love and to love is to be closer to God. To love is divine. Accept yourself, give yourself time. Don't try to become straight. Follow your heart. That's what any loving God asks you to do. Just have faith. Yes it says its wrong in the Book, but those were different times and homosexuality meant more towards rape and dominance....it said nothing about two men loving each other. Gay men can have families too, maybe not in your culture, but moving is always an option. I suggest you start believing in yourself, take it day by day. With all the murder and rape and scamming going on in the world, I don't think your God could hate one little act of love...do you?|`|6GpN0NOIaa	always be who u are dont leat any one stop u|`|EEVx7gKeaa	You can't change yourself in this way.

Keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Being gay isn't wrong at all. I know some Muslim friends of mine who are bisexual/gay and have learned to accept it. Since Allah is all loving, according to Islamic belief he will love you if you're gay or straight, tall or short.<br>  <br>  You can't cure yourself of being gay. Assuming there is Allah, he created you and so obviously doesn't hate all gays. Have faith.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.

qvycijbOaa	'Women empowerment' to me means sexism. Coming from the women that condone it, and the men that detest it. Bad, bad choice. I don't really see what rights women don't get anymore... Women get every top job available on par with men.<br>  There are top organisations that have been set up to promote women's sports, especially athletics and soccer. What equal rights aren't there?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Right, I misinterpreted the question. I now see where you are going with this. <br>  <br>  Men are stronger than women, (usually) correct.This does not mean that women have the right to hit a man and expect to not be hit back. I find that hypocritcal and unjust. Why should a woman be allowed to hit a man and not be hit back? Whether it is with the help of a weapon, an instrument, a fist or any other type of body part. Men are not all stronger than women, and some women are scary as hell! I have met women who constantly belittle men and mentally, can make them feel intimidated and minute in their presence. I don't mean to exaggerate but your theory is shared with those from an unfair and oppresive position in power, as history shows us.<br>  <br>  These are the same morals that were enforced in many oppresive regimes from Slavery to the Holocaust. The oppresor would brainwash the masses that the oppressed is dangerous, violent or unciviillized. As you seem to be constantly saying with men (that they are all strong and a threat to a feeble, weak woman). These ideals seem to be those that you share. The common way of thinking in racist America perpetuated by the media was "black people are big and strong and stupid therefore any time this person steps remotely out of line, punish him and he/she should not have the opportunity to hit back". You will find that these are the exact opposite factors of slavery that people fought for to gain justice from. What you are claiming for women is not justice, but a way to take advantage of a man because of their symbol in society.<br>  <br>  Chances are, I wouldn't even hit a woman if she hit me in the face with an object or a fist, because of the way I have been brought up, but if she did, I think I should have the right to hit her back. Things could really get out of hand if a man is aware that legally he has is not permitted to strike a woman even in self defense.|`|aUScPZFYaa	-The whole Chris Brown and Rihanna thing still hasn't had a lot of details come out. No man has no reason to hit on a woman, period. Chris Brown seems like a pussy. I don't agree with anyone hitting anybody. But that doesn't give his country-bumpkin Virginia *** to hit my Caribbean sister Rihanna. <br>  <br>  <br>  -Empowerment means owning my own proper, having an education, feeling confident about myself, and being myself.|`|vcdhCiU6aa	Liberal Feminist against mothers.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	The women's empowerment movement is basically a small component in the revolution in the way women are compensated, treated and respected in comparison to their male counterparts.  Personally, it means that as a woman, I have the wherewithal to balance a career and family (if I choose to have one) without it causing/being a conflict.  It means that I can choose any profession I desire and earn equal pay based on my qualifications and not my gender.   <br>  <br>  I have seen the argument posted on here that because women are equal to men, a man has the right to defend himself physically against a woman.  The argument of equality amongst the sexes isn't applicable because violence is never fair nor just.  Someone always ends up physically/emotionally hurt.  Secondly, a man most likely will overpower a woman so with that being said, a man should refrain himself from inflicting violence onto anyone, but especially a woman no matter what.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	HAVING IT ALL HAHA!<br>  <br>  <br>  no. it means being treated as a human being who has as much potential to achieve in life as a man does. it means not being treated as a sex object. it means being respected.|`|XoNuUrYoaa	*shakes head*<br>  <br>  this Q was above yours, the irony...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoZxEJYJ_G_makNLcf3bWcXz7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223123036AAuqDEs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11634270	Women are better than men.|`|AA11059890	that women are equal and none of this nit picking crap i see so often, i see many women treat equal rights like a buffet table, "ohh that looks yummy i want some of that, nuh uh none of that that smells icky" just taking the parts they want while leaving the ones they don't behind, sorry darlings doesn't work that way, all or nothin'. i've only had a few women in my life that thought it was ok to smack guys around, when it comes to violence i have only one rule "touch not lest ye be touched" i got hit enough in my life it got old i won't be hit anymore|`|Fu1emcF3aa	Oh shut up please.<br>  <br>  Women are the only ones who make a big deal about gender.

Total BS. Those people that create those statistics will take a woman's salary (who teaches poetry) and a man's salary (who teaches astrophysics) and compare them to show the "sexism" that exists.<br>  <br>  Please shut up.<br>  <br>  There is no need for "women empowerment" whatsoever. Things are good right now. 60% of college degrees are for women, all the double-standards work for you, and you can claim sexism for anythign you don't like so just shut up.|`|HimBbU6caa	Quote from you: "Instead violence has consequences for both men and women"<br>  <br>  Well according to your logic you claim that a man never has a right to hit a woman, so in theory, if this thinking was somehow enforced throughout the whole world without prejudice there would be absolutely no consequences for women. You say a man being attacked by a woman should do his best to restrain the woman wielding a pipe, samurai sword, a gun maybe? <br>  <br>  Yes violence does have grave consequences for men and women. That is why people who say that a man should never hit a woman under ANY circumstances show their hypocrisy in their quest for "equality". If people were taught to keep their hands to themselves out of respect for other human beings, regardless of gender there would be no need to debate this. Instead people like you want to make exceptions based on your proposed "women are weaker than men argument." Hypocrisy! In your world a woman can kick a man in the balls just because he said something she didn't like at the bar. As he is on his knees feeling like death itself (you can't imagine the feeling) she in turn has a glass filled with Amaretto and pineapple juice swinging it directly at his head. In your world this man is supposed to do his best to restrain her, that is his only option. He can't do anything more. His chances of receiving a serious head injury notwithstanding, not to mention the prospects of not making babies for the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  Faith, you do women an injustice, as well as those who support this sexist ideology, (that's what it is like it or not). The golden rule is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. If more people were preaching this simple proverb things would be so much better, but instead we listen to the fool Dr. Phil and justify sexism based on broad terms, the whole men are physically strong and women are physically weak thing. How strong am I if some evil, violent woman has a baseball bat in her hands swinging it like a mad dog? I'm only allowed to restrain her? That's crazy. I should have the opportunity to meet serious violence with violence, regardless of gender. If that means punching her in the face to curb the threat it's just got to be that way.<br>  <br>  The hypocrisy of modern feminism. Teach people to respect human life regardless of gender. Don't teach that men don't have the right to protect themselves from physical harm. You claim that a man doesn't think about his mother or sisters in these situations, but if my sister kicked a guy in the balls and tried to hit him in the head with a drink glass for no reason, save her hurt feelings, all I can say is that she should be prepared to deal with the consequences of her actions.<br>  <br>  Edit: @ Faith. Thanks for the thumbs down BTW. I can see you're the type that expects people to see your vision. <br>  <br>  Quote from you: It's hypocritical to say that a woman can violently attack a man."<br>  <br>  You can't be serious. I don't know what bubble you have lived in, but that statement is just flat out illogical. You mean to tell me a woman kicking a man in the balls and hitting him in the head with a drink glass is not an attack? You can not be serious.<br>  <br>  Edit 2 @ Faith: A lot of my answer is based on the answer we both gave to a question a few days ago. I hope you didn't forget what you wrote.|`|OZjlW5utaa	Basically women are seen as the weaker sex, Alto this is mostly true, its not in some cases. Women having empowerment, or fighting 'like men' in a mental way shouldnt mean its ok for us to hit women because they are supposedly empowering themselves like us and 'want' to fight. No one wants to fight, women who have empowered themselves are simply trying to be on the same wavelength as men and want to be able to stand up for themselves the same way as we do. But we most of time should always keep in mind that most women are not as physically strong as men, and in that context we shouldnt be as physical.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkcKFF5lhNgnvYBJtCoPC3TV7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223134758AARqTgN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> - If you can|`|pfke6Jieaa	i gotta agree with patrick. i think its mostly women who develop those thoughts, along with many other thoughts and claims, while men could actually care less. we are not trying hard to make women suffer, its just that women, in general, are too sensitive to be honest and show more aggression in their opinion. <br>  <br>  using the chris brown and rihana story doesnt even mean that some men act like that, not even some. i think both genders need to look at their own faults and really women need to stop pointing all fingers at men because no one is perfect. if someone, man or woman, wants respect, then they need to earn it. not create woman empowerment because usually, u know and i know, that they are NEVER peaceful. as soon as given the chance, there will be trouble trust me.<br>  <br>  EDIT: here is an example i want u to look at. i dont mean to rant on the person but questions like these are seriously ridiculous.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqAF6ePov9iYS5yjEB_AXP7z7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223125156AAe0S5X">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: faith, yes i understand what u mean. i wasnt attacking u or anything trust me. i was just trying to make notice of something controversial and it bothers me too when i see it.|`|vanUYJjjaa	Being an empowered woman to me, means being able to make my own choices.

It's basically saying: Well a man should now be allowed to be abusive to his wife since they wanted to be considered equal. Also known as the ever popular "B**** asked for it" cleverly hidden. I mean we wanted to wear the pants of a man and take men's jobs so why shouldn't men be allowed to hit women?<br>  <br>  Well there are actually two sides to this. <br>  First side: It's completely ridiculous. Our wanting to make the same wages and be considered  just as capable as men does not mean men and women perform the same physical functions. Until I complete my black belt I am pretty much at the physical mercy of many men out there. And even then as a slight 5'2'' woman, there are always going to be some men who are could beat me into a pulp without even straining a muscle. But does this mean I should not be considered his equal in the workplace? Of course not, that's crazy troll logic. Men can't give birth, does that make it okay for me to lord my innate abilities over him in the name of "equality"?<br>  <br>  2nd side: I see the point some of these future Ike Turners are making, even though I still think they are violent morons who grew up watching Daddy "discipline" Mommy and should seek counseling. Women are still expecting a double standard. If we ever hope to be taken seriously we have to stop letting it be okay for women to tell sexist jokes about men or for a woman to hit a man whenever she gets angry in a fight and expect him not to hit her back. Also we have to empower ourselves and close whatever gap we can physically. I mean half my anger at all these violent men supporting Chris Brown is actually fear. I know I am completely vulnerable. And it scares me to know that if I were to anger some guy he could whale on me to his leisure. Some of the women on here are using arguments against hitting women like, "it's like hitting a child." UMMM, I am no child. How can we hope to be seen as equals when we are comparing ourselves to children? Good intent, bad analogy. I personally am taking steps to decrease my helplessness. I am taking a self defense course. And I encourage every woman to take one. True empowerment does sometimes mean might = right. You can't always depend on a man's good sense to stop him. Some don't have any.

You seem to be arguing for people to answer "in my opinion" rather than in a way that suggests they, and only they, have the ultimate truth about the subject under debate. <br>  <br>  I think there's a lot to that suggestion.  It may not read as well, but at least when you write "in my opinion" X and Y are true, you're being honest.  Also, you're not claiming to know more about the subject than you do.  <br>  <br>  Those are good things, I think, and they leave open the possibility that the other person will reply, "Well, I disgree.  In my opinion, X and Y are not true."  You can both express your ideas without getting it quite as much of a mental war about the nature of truth.|`|0WB5Tru5aa	Just a hint.

It seems to me that your argument is like an opinion based on what you (and also the dictionary) defined opinion as. Now then, your argument's valididity, or should i say correctness, is based entirely on the general opinion of what an opinion is, and therefore should technically not be called "right" or anything absolute or definite.

H41u0B8Jaa	No idea what that show is you were watching!  I was a teenager in the 1970's and I can tell you that is the last thing my parents would have encouraged...none of my friends had parents like that either.  I watched old TV shows from the 1950's when I was younger and I thought all parents from the 1950's had a stay at home mom who cooked and cleaned in dresses and pearls (June Cleaver) and the man went out to some office job, they had beautiful houses and the husband/father was the "boss" of the family.  I'm pretty sure the parents of the 1950's were not all like that....so the portrayal of 1970's family is about as accurate as the portrayal of the 1950's families.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Orgies?

One generation is supposed to have not liked the rules and orders we gave them so when they had children, they had no rules at all. And so it goes. Along with the schools telling 4th graders they didn't have to clean their rooms, or if they were punished to tell teacher and she would report the parents for abuse. Kids caught on real fast that they didn't have to mind, or help around the house. True I saw this happen with a grandson and spoke with that darned teacher myself. I could not believe the crap she spouted at the kids.  Now years later most of those kids have quit school and just hang around, including my grandson. <br>    The lack of morals are a combination of TV, music and videos, nasty movies and both parents working and no one watching the kids.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Parents in the 70's were more conservative than parents of the 80's, 90's and 2000's.

I do know someone who drove a taxi in the Hollywood area that heard a different story.  He was called to pick up some teenagers from one mansion in the hills and take them back to their homes in another section of Hollywood area. He listened to them talking in the backseat of the cab.  One boy about 15 or 16 and asked the other boy what he did that night. He told him he slept with his friend's mother, and then asked what he did that night. He told him he shot up heroin. His friend asked him where he got heroin, and he replied "my mom bought it for me."  One of the boy's little sister, about 13, was sitting there listening to it all.  It turned the taxi driver's stomach so badly that it ended his "California Dream" and in a few months he returned to his home state in the heartland of the US.|`|09affeac55dbe7c8b68c339feb29879faa	I was a new parent in the mid 70's and I never encouraged drugs or sex.

H8WqMK1eaa	“Shaikh Abd-al-Aziz Ibn Abd-Allah Ibn Baaz” <br>  <br>  His first fatwa was ‘employment of non-Muslims in the Arabian Gulf forbidden by Islam.’ After few decades, this genius gave another fatwa ‘Non-Muslim troops should be deployed on Saudi Arabia soil to defend the Kingdom from the Iraqi army’ (Kepel, 2004). This fatwa seems to be just a reversal of the first one, but we have to understand that geniuses always think differently and they develop new creative ideas from time to time. It is not easy for a simpleton to understand the creative capacities of a genius. <br>  <br>  He had authored many books to benefit mankind which are full of wisdom. His books are always best-sellers within Muslim world only. The most famous of his discovery is that which is stated in the book named, “Evidence that the Earth is Standing Still.” This scientific research work was published by Islamic University of Medina, Saudi Arabia, during 1974. On page 23 of this academic research work he talked about his brilliant discovery and cited many references from Koran and Ahadith. He confidently challenged the age-old belief of earth’s rotation and quoted as follows, <br>  <br>  “If the earth is rotating as they claim, the countries, the mountains, the trees, the rivers, and the oceans will have no bottom and the people will see the eastern countries move to the west and the western countries move to the east."|`|e3PWZYsAaa	maybe because "sheik abdel-aziz ibn boaz" (if such person even exists/existed) doesn't represent Islam........<br>  <br>  you want to know who represent Islam?<br>  <br>  Mohammad (PBUH) represents Islam.......<br>  ......Imam Ali (as) represents Islam<br>  <br>  Islam is the Holy Quran..........<br>  <br>  <br>  live like Ali (as)...............<br>  .......die like Hussain (as)<br>  <br>  <br>  and no, your fabricated hadihs doesn't mean anything..........|`|zKQKl9mZaa	He didn't say this, look back at your same question that you posted before. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiodqsE9wTlYZtjm1B77e57ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081221064942AAH0NOH&show=7#profile-info-d1i3ac5baa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|WSwDFwC5aa	He was probably talking with the cubic time dude, Dr. Gene Ray.|`|51892c12506b240500310aefa8daf61daa	Dogs will always bark so continue barking.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  Wow....Nice Rant.......|`|xTRMSm7yaa	dude ur so boring, go watch a movie or something
zBqt99avaa	In addition to what you've received already:<br>  <br>  I'm RC, so yes, I observe/celebrate lent.  When I was a child, my mom was particularly strict, so in addition to giving up a food thing we loved, we had to give up a bad habit (swearing, back talk, etc.) AND we had to pray morning and night, not just night.<br>  <br>  No meat on Fridays is generally done throughout the year, not just through lent, but my family only observed this tradition on Good Friday.<br>  <br>  My mom would fast throughout lent.  But since we don't do sunrise to sunset, and reflecting Jesus' ordeal (as pointed out by Nat), she would have 1 slice of plain bread and 1 cup tea (I guess she couldn't stomach locusts) at breakfast and the same at supper, but nothing else, day or night for 40 days.<br>  <br>  Tomorrow marks Shrove Tuesday aka Mardi Gras ("Fat Tuesday") aka Pancake Tuesday.  It is the day before Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent.  Traditionally, people ate pancakes on Shrove Tuesday to clear out their cupboards of those food items they won't be eating (lard, for example) since they would abstain from all types of confections during Lent.<br>  <br>  Personally, I usually have pancakes on Shrove Tuesday and I give something up for Lent, but I don't do all the extras my mom put us and herself through.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	It's a Roman Catholic tradition.<br>  <br>  Not everyone who calls themselves a "Christian" observes Lent.<br>  <br>  It's not Biblical.<br>  <br>  Lent is a 40-day liturgical season that begins on Ash Wednesday and concludes at the Great Vigil of Easter.  Sundays are not included in the 40-day count because every Sunday is a joyful celebration of Jesus' resurrection.  Though not biblical, Lent has long been a tradition in the Christian Church, and it is thought that the tradition of the 40 days recalls the 40 days Jesus spent in the wilderness, fasting and being tempted by Satan (Matthew 4:1-11).  Lent is considered a time of penance and discipline.

That's the reason why prayer in school got banned and  why gets kid suspended for reading their Bibles on campus during recess and why teachers get fired because a student asked them to pray for them after school hours.

Instead of using LSD, man could alter his consciousness through Yoga and Hindu forms of meditation, such as the Transcendental Meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.  Karma is the Hindu teaching that actions in one's life will determine a person's fate in the next cycle of life.  Fatalism destroys any desire for human achievement in life, since everything is already predetermined by fate.  There is no basis for love or human compassion in an impersonal universe.  This is why in Asia, Hindu and Buddhist cultures do not build hopsitals or schools:  there is no basis for human value.  If all is one there is no difference between good and evil.  <br>  <br>  Yoga as a religious Hindu teaching technique was systematized in India around 200 B.C.  Yoga means union with god but the Hindu concept of God is the Impersonal All.  So when we become one with the universe we are one with god.<br>  <br>  However, the Holy Bible inspired by the One and Only God says the only way is by His Son, Jesus the Christ.|`|89MKzLl3aa	Sure, in P.E.<br>  <br>  Yoga isn't a religion and wouldn't violate separation of Church and State.|`|i48kxrbaaa	Sure, it should be as an elective, though.|`|AA10422553	Yoga (long vowvel "A") per se does NOT mean anything.<br>  <br>  Yoga Paadhanjalam is definitely one of six Hindu Philosophies(Shat Dharsanas)- arranged in 3 duplets--Nyaaya-Vaishsikam--Saankya-YOGA...

OPnjPaDKaa	Schadenfreude is correct (as posted by others).<br>  It's one of the many composed nouns in german which do not have an exact translation into English.

DvZdB66maa	Unfortunately, it's all part of the sexism in society... Society pits us all against each other, as if it is a world-wide competition of some sort. That puts women on the defensive, because they constantly feel like they have to be better than the next woman. It shouldn't be that way, but that's how society has made it.<br>  <br>  I have had many women dislike me before they even got to know me... sometimes, it was over guys that I didn't know or even CARE to know. Sometimes, it was just because I walked into the room and maybe made them feel self-conscious. But I'm sure every woman has experienced this to some degree.<br>  <br>  There are many unspoken rules to being a woman. If you are an attractive woman, there are even MORE. Being an attractive woman myself, I have noticed extreme competition. There are women who are used to being the "pretty one" of their circle/group/class/church/fill in the blank... so, if another pretty woman walks in, they instantly HATE her. I have noticed this when I have walked into situations and tried to befriend another pretty girl... Not happening. They automatically hate me. I've taken some of the "spotlight" away from them. I'm sure we all have examples like this.|`|hB3KPcd5aa	Maybe because of jealousy.|`|pfke6Jieaa	amen sista. and yet many women think they are being mistreated by men and make feminist movements. when in reality its women who make fun of each other and are jealous as hell of each other. i have met few women who are content with them selves (probably like a finger count) but most were just ready to scratch each others eye balls out....sheesh.....i never let my self get into that situation. <br>  <br>  i think most women will either really like u or really hate u, there is no middle of the road for them. i already experienced with them and this statement, as i noticed, is almost always true. u cant be friends with a woman. either best friend or worst enemy. i think it has to do with their hormones im not sure. but as we mature i started to develop somewhat of a frienship with many women now.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	I steer clear of gossipping and all that crap.  I find it sad too that with all the stigma that women have to deal with day to day that we create more for each other.  Instead of hurting each other and falling into the same hurtful routines, we should support each other and have each other's backs.<br>  <br>  You can see the bond between people based on their common race, religion, culture, career, etc.  Why not on a common sex too?

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Allah is surely al-Wahhab because He is the Most Munificent, the Most Giving, the One Who ever tries to get closer to His servants, Who graciously bestows His favours upon them, Who gives them even before they ask Him, the ever-Giver Who gives everyone what he needs. Al-Wahhab bestows His blessings upon His servants, and this indicates His inclusion of everyone as He continuously gives. He does not give painstakingly, nor does He seek a benefit, or an advantage, for Himself by doing so. Al-Wahhab showers you with His blessings without having to have a reason or a means to do so. Al-Wahhab gives away without being compensated for what He gives, and He causes all beings to die without a particular purpose He seeks to achieve for Himself. According to Surat al-Shura, "He bestows (children), male or female, according to His Will (and Plan)" (Qura'n, 42:49).<br>  <br>  Whenever the Messenger of Allah used to wake up during the night, he would supplicate thus: "Lord! There is no god but You! Glory to You! Lord! I seek Your forgiveness for my sins, and I plead to You, by Your mercy, O Lord, to increase my share of knowledge, not to permit my heart to deviate after having guided it, and to grant me, from You, a mercy, for surely You are al-Wahhab..." [4]<br>  <br>  So those Shias who make fun of this name should really be ashamed of themselves.

1XURE9YDaa	How do you make people do what you tell them?  By telling them that if they don't do as you say, believe as you say, something bad will happen to them.  As someone who grew up in the Bible Belt, I was forever having people assume I was a Christian and telling me that I was a shining light for those who were struggling.  The fruits of the spirit and all that.  Then when I told them I was actually a Pagan, it all went down the drain.<br>  <br>  For your friend, it probably has less to do with actually hoping/wanting you to burn in Hell, but she believe so strongly what she's been told.  Don't let it get you down, and - even though I know it kinda sucks - be the bigger person with your friend.  Tell her that you understand where she stands, but you don't agree and ask that she drop it.  If she is a true Christian, she will let you be.  She may not stop praying for you, but, hey, we could all use a little prayer.  Even if you don't believe in God, believe in the power of positive thinking.

Everyone has told a lie at some time in their lives, many have stolen something (however small).  Many have blasphemed or hated or been envious at some time in their lives.  If you added one persons sin together in their whole lifetime, it would add up to a substantial amount of wrong doing. Even if in general someone believed that they were a good person.  Even comparing yourself to someone else and saying "well at least I am not as bad as they are" is wrong.  Big or small, sin is sin. <br>  <br>  Your friend really believes what the bible says.  Just imagine for one minute that she was right.  If you died tomorrow and she had never told you, then would she have been a good friend by keeping this information to herself and never sharing it with you? If you face God tomorrow and say that you are a good person in comparision to others, are you convinced that He will let you off the hook?  What about the fact that you have chosen to deny Him, or never took the time to seek Him? God's standards are not our standards, He is a perfect God, He shows perfect love and will give perfect justice.  <br>  <br>  "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."

A sin is not putting God first in everything we do,a bad thought, lying, rebellion, swearing, disobedience, stealing, unmarried sex ,getting intoxicated, doing illegal drugs,  lust, murder, etc.... <br>  You name it we’ve All done at least one of the above in our life time. How will they be paid for ? Romans  6:23   “ For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord .”This death penalty for sin, is  talking about physical death ( which we are familiar with ), and talking about a spiritual  death (forever separated from the love of God ) in a literal lake of eternal  fire!<br>  Revelation 20:14  “ And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death .”<br>  “But isn’t God a loving , all forgiving God ? Would a loving God send some one to Hell” ?The first thing we must realize is that we are each sinners, each guilty before a Holy and Just God. God must judge us of our sins and, OUR SINS against God will send us to hell. If God were to allow one sin to go unpunished, he would not be a just judge.What judge let’s guilty people go free ?  He Cannot DO That ! He must be true to his Holy nature. God is perfectly just to judge us of our sins, of which each of us are guilty.We deserve the death  penalty for sin, which is eternal torment and suffering in the Lake Of Fire. But God with his unmeasured Mercy provided  for us a way out: His wonderful gift of eternal salvation through the shedding of blood by his only begotten Son Jesus.Romans 10:13   “ For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved .” John 14:6- I am the way. See #Isa 35:8. By this is meant, doubtless, that they and all others were to have access to God only by obeying the instructions, imitating the example, and depending on the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ.  He was the leader in the road, the guide to the wandering, the teacher of the ignorant, and the example to all. See John 6:68: "Thou hast the words of eternal life;" 1Peter 2:21. "Christ—suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps;" Hebrews 9:8 9.  The source of truth, or he who originates and communicates truth for the salvation of men. Truth is a representation of things as they are. The life, the purity, and the teaching of Jesus Christ was the most complete and perfect representation of the things of the eternal world that has been or can be presented to man. The ceremonies of the Jews were shadows; the life of Jesus was the truth. The opinions of men are fancy, but the doctrines of Jesus were nothing more than a representation of facts as they exist in the government of God. It is implied in this, also, that Jesus was the fountain of all truth; that by his inspiration the prophets spoke, and that by him all truth is communicated to men.The life. SeeJohn 11:25,<br>  <br>  No man cometh to the Father but by me. To come to the Father is to obtain his favour, to have access to his throne by prayer, and finally to enter his kingdom. No man can obtain any of these things except by the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ. By coming by him is meant coming in his name and depending on his merits. We are ignorant, and he alone can guide us. We are sinful, and it is only by his merits that we can be pardoned. We are blind, and he only can enlighten us. God has appointed him as the Mediator, and has ordained that all blessings shall descend to this world through him. Hence he has put the world under his control; has given the affairs of men into his hand, and has appointed him to dispense whatever may be necessary for our peace, pardon, and salvation, Acts 4:22 5:31.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	John 14:6<br>   6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>  <br>  Only Christ can be our ideal, our “bright and morning star” (Rev. 22:16). Only he can say without any reservation, “Follow me; learn of me; do the things you have seen me do. Drink of my water and eat of my bread. I am the way, the truth, and the life. I am the law and the light. Look unto me and ye shall live. Love one another as I have loved you” (see Matt. 11:29; Matt. 16:24; John 4:13-14; John 6:35, 51; John 7:37; John 13:34|`|1iKEQ6yYaa	Good works will not save one from their sins or get one into heaven;<br>  only a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, as Lord and Saviour<br>   to we have hope of eternal life with Jesus Christ.|`|67EaIAvbaa	Jesus is GOD..colossians1:15-20<br>  <br>  your toast..1 john 5:10-12|`|atfKCzmPaa	HOW TO IDENTIFY THE TRUE RELIGION<br>  5 How can ‘the road to life’ be found? Jesus said that the true religion would be evident in the lives of the people who practice it. “By their fruits you will recognize them,” he said. “Every good tree produces fine fruit.” (Matthew 7:16, 17) In other words, those who practice the true religion would be recognized by their beliefs and their conduct. Although they are not perfect and they make mistakes, true worshipers as a group seek to do God’s will. <br>  6 God’s servants base their teachings on the Bible. The Bible itself says: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man [or woman] of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” (2 Timothy 3:16, 17) <br>  7 Jesus Christ set the proper example by basing his teachings on God’s Word. In prayer to his heavenly Father, he said: “Your word is truth.” (John 17:17) Jesus believed the Word of God, and everything he taught harmonized with the Scriptures. Jesus often said: “It is written.” (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10) Similarly, God’s people today do not teach their own ideas. <br>  8 Those who practice the true religion worship only Jehovah and make his name known. Jesus declared: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (Matthew 4:10) Thus, God’s servants worship no one other than Jehovah. This worship includes letting people know what the name of the true God is and what he is like. Psalm 83:18 states: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” Jesus set the pattern in helping others to get to know God, as he said in prayer: “I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world.” (John 17:6) <br>  9 God’s people show genuine, unselfish love for one another. Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35) The early Christians had such love for one another. Godly love overcomes racial, social, and national barriers and draws people together in an unbreakable bond of true brotherhood. (Colossians 3:14) Members of false religions do not have such a loving brotherhood. How do we know that? They kill one another because of national or ethnic differences. The Bible states: “The children of God and the children of the Devil are evident by this fact: Everyone who does not carry on righteousness does not originate with God, neither does he who does not love his brother. . . . We should have love for one another; not like Cain, who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother.”—1 John 3:10-12; 4:20, 21.<br>  11 True Christians accept Jesus Christ as God’s means of salvation. The Bible says: “There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.” (Acts 4:12). In addition, Jesus is God’s appointed King in the heavenly Kingdom that will rule the entire earth. And God requires that we obey Jesus and apply his teachings if we want everlasting life. That is why the Bible states: “He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life.”—John 3:36.<br>  12 True worshipers are no part of the world. When on trial before the Roman ruler Pilate, Jesus said: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” (John 18:36) No matter what country they live in, Jesus’ true followers are subjects of his heavenly Kingdom and thus maintain strict neutrality in the world’s political affairs. They take no part in its conflicts.And while God’s true worshipers are neutral regarding politics, they are law-abiding. <br>  13 Jesus’ true followers preach that God’s Kingdom is mankind’s only hope. Jesus foretold: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matthew 24:14) Instead of encouraging people to look to human rulers to solve their problems, true followers of Jesus Christ proclaim God’s heavenly Kingdom as the only hope for mankind. (Psalm 146:3) Jesus taught us to pray for that perfect government when he said: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matthew 6:10) <br>  14 On the basis of what we have just considered, ask yourself: ‘What religious group bases all its teachings on the Bible and makes known Jehovah’s name? What group practices godly love, exercises faith in Jesus, is no part of the world, and proclaims that God’s Kingdom is the only real hope for mankind? Of all the religious groups on earth, which one meets all these requirements?’ The facts clearly show that it is Jehovah’s Witnesses.—Isaiah 43:10-12.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	It says what it says. You either accept it or reject it.<br>  <br>  Regarding those who repent. None of us DESERVE to go to Heaven because we are ALL sinners. It is not our goodness that gets us to Heaven but God's grace.  Grace means unmerited favour. God is gracious and merciful towards us even though we don't deserve it. It is the acknowledging of our sins and our request for forgiveness that makes the difference.<br>  <br>  You seem to have the impression that it is your own goodness that should get you to Heaven and that you think you are too good to go to hell.  However, I'd like to ask why you believe in either of these destinations if you don't believe in God.

You can even talk to a missionary.  There is a section of Q&A<br>  <br>  The main differences:<br>  -We don't believe scripture "ended" with the Bible, we believe in continued revelation, through prophets<br>  -We believe Christ, God the Father and the Holy Ghost are all three separate beings/persons<br>  -We believe prophets are still chosen to lead Christ's church<br>  -We believe the full gospel was lost after Christ's disciples died and the Preisthood was taken from the earth, and that it was restored through the prophet Joseph Smith<br>  - We believe there are necessary ordinances that pertain to exaltation (we believe in more than just salvation) <br>  <br>  Those are probly the main differences.  To convert... you need to speak with the missionaries, read the Book of Mormon to gain a testimony of it and Joseph Smith, be living certain standards - like no smoking, drinking alcohol, no coffee or tea - and meet with your local bishop for an interview.  Then, you would be baptized and confirmed a member.  You would also receive the gift of the Holy Ghost at your confirmation.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|Mnm35sjNaa	LDS followers must be able to accept many articles of faith on top of that required by Christianity.<br>  <br>  The following true story should illustrate nicely . . .<br>  <br>  . . . One time, 2 young Mormon women came a-knockin'.  They were both very attractive, polite and wholesome.  One of them was black.  I asked her why she chose to be a Mormon when the Book of Mormon contains insulting bigotry against black people.  Here's the verse I'm referring to:<br>  <br>  ????2 Nephi 5:21<br>  ????"And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them."<br>  <br>  ????See also: Mormon 5:15, Alma 3:6, Alma 3:9, Alma 3:14<br>  <br>  Can you believe that?  God made the descendants of Cain black so that they “might not be enticing” unto white people.  Blatant, transparent racism right in the "holy" Book of Mormon!  Not only is it racist, it's a bald-faced lie!!<br>  <br>  The white woman spoke up for the black woman and said that racism has been renounced by the Mormon church.  The black woman agreed.<br>  <br>  I asked how the Mormon church got the authority to renounce a verse from their "divinely inspired" Book of Mormon: could they override God's word?  They pulled out their "brown books" but could not find an answer.<br>  <br>  I then pointed out that if God really inspired the Book of Mormon, it would NEVER need ANY part renounced.  That only happens when humans pretend they're God.<br>  <br>  I told them that there were already far too many religions in the world before Mormonism came along.  How can God blame anybody for choosing the wrong religion?  Will he really condemn billions of people to hell because they guessed wrong?<br>  <br>  I suggested they keep an open mind and try to place their faith in scripture that doesn't contain ideas and practices that we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  What I didn't say was that, if they really tried to follow my advice, they wouldn't find ANY scripture WITHOUT ideas and practices we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  I must say that, despite the outcome of our conversation, the 2 young ladies remained open and engaged.  I didn’t detect any animosity.  However, when they eventually left, they were visibly shaken.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	We believe that God calls prophets. The prophets learn directly from God about salvation and the purpose of life. THey then teach the rest of us. God called prophets among the Israelites and through their writings we have the Bible. Salvation comes through Jesus Christ, who is God. He is the bridge between God and man. Prophets teach us more about Christ as well. <br>  Joseph Smith was called as a prophet in 1820. Joseph taught about salvation and claimed to be a witness of Jesus Christ. We have his writings in the Book of Mormon and other books. <br>  Jesus taught that the Holy Ghost will teach us truth in John 16:13. <br>  If you want to join the church, you can go to mormon.org and request a visit from missionaries.

KsesIVWtaa	Well to me that just sounds like he treats you like a best friend that just likes to hang out with you. Maybe you have been over thinking this a bit. Guys mess around and rough house at times but since you think that he might be gay maybe everything he does makes you a homophobic. At school he might avoid you and talk to others at times because you know how school is you hang out with your crowd and when you are out you do what you want. If he has not done anything sexual or tried to kiss you then why think that way. If you tell him that you think he is gay just cause he likes you more like a brother than just a friend it might ruin your friendship. If he does do sexual advances and tries to kiss you then you might just tell him you don't go that way and if he really is your best friend then he will understand and will not do that again. If you don't want to be friends then with in time you will go your separate and move on.|`|jeHqXQEZaa	At that age, I think a lot of guys have feelings that they don't understand.

IQWyPohEaa	>>>Christians! Why are you so amused that we can't prove that God does not exist?<br>  It really shouldn't, you know. It should worry you.<<<<br>  <br>  It doesn't amuse me.   I just think it's illogical that atheists seemingly think they can make a statement of fact ("God doesn't exist") without offering any evidence to back up that statement.<br>  <br>  >>>In order to "prove" anything about anything - that thing MUST actually exist. The idea of "proof" becomes nonsensical otherwise.<<<<br>  <br>  Not true.   A police detective can prove that a crime suspect did NOT commit the crime.  He can prove a negative -- notwithstanding atheists' claims that negatives cannot be proven.<br>  <br>  If God truly did not exist -- as you atheists claim -- then you should be able to provide some evidence that rules out His existence.  So far, you haven't.    <br>  <br>  Not a single one of you, in all of human history, has ever given anybody a reason to "rule out" the existence of God.<br>  <br>  >>>Therefore - the fact that we cannot possibly offer you that evidence - and are happy to admit it - does suggest that he, indeed, does not exist.<<<<br>  <br>  No, it doesn't -- and you're violating every rule of logic here, even though you atheists often proclaim yourselves the champions of logic.<br>  <br>  You cannot offer any evidence whatsoever to support your "statement of fact" that God does not exist.   <br>  <br>  Therefore, "God does not exist" is not a proven fact -- which in turn leaves at least the possibility that He exists.  <br>  <br>  It's a possibility that too many of you atheists so smugly refuse to acknowledge.<br>  <br>  >>>If something actually exists, you should be able to find enough evidence to make a positive statement about it.<<<<br>  <br>  There is plenty of evidence that God exists -- the problem is, though, that you atheists won't accept any evidence we offer.   <br>  <br>  For instance, we offer you as evidence the fact that this world is PERFECTLY situated in the universe to sustain life -- too perfectly situated to have occured by accident or by any of the designs you atheists offer us.<br>  <br>  Also, most atheists admit they believe in the Laws of Nature -- but stubbornly refuse to admit that the "Laws of Nature" imply the existence of a Lawmaker.  <br>  <br>  These are just two pieces of evidence that you atheists refuse to acknowledge as evidence.  <br>  <br>  It's not that we cannot offer evidence -- it's just that, for us, trying to offer an atheist evidence of God's existence is only slightly less futile than trying to budge a brick wall.   <br>  <br>  The wall simply refuses to budge.  So do you atheists.  <br>  <br>  >>>The fact that you, also, can provide no evidence only adds to our assertion.<<<<br>  <br>  But we can provide evidence.  Read again what I just wrote above.  <br>  <br>  >>>(PS: Please don't fall into the wind, gravity, love etc trap. No, we can't see these things - we can see their effects, though).<<<<br>  <br>  Huh?<br>  <br>  How can you see love's effects?   How can you even prove that love is there?<br>  <br>  Can you prove that you love your parents?<br>  <br>  You can't!   You just know that you do -- and you depend on others to believe you, as a matter of trust and even FAITH, when you say that you love them. <br>  <br>  You cannot offer ANY proof, or even evidence, that you love your parents.<br>  <br>  Saying "I love you" to them is not proof or evidence -- nor is doing nice things for them, or buying them nice things, or even living a good life as testament to the good job they did raising you.<br>  <br>  None of these things PROVES that you love your parents.  There are many other possible reasons why you do those things -- reasons that have nothing to do with love.<br>  <br>  So, it's illogical to say that love can be proven by its effects -- because the effects could have some other goal in mind, such as civic responsibility or seeking approval of others, that has nothing to do with love.<br>  <br>  .|`|AA10504443	These answers all point to my recent theory that Christianity is non-existent.

You can't have it both ways.  Drop the double standard and have the intellectual integrity to play on a level field.  There is abundant evidence of God's existence in the testimony of honest, intelligent and well-grounded adult human beings.  This type of evidence is admissible in a court of law, but like a proper Sadducee, you set an impossible standard of proof and then pretend that the thing you dislike doesn't exist.  (I'll assume you're ignorant of what I mean.  Moses said everyone should listen to the prophet coming after him who would be even greater than he.  The Sadducees simply defined Moses as the greatest prophet of all time so they wouldn't have to acknowledge any further inconvenient truths.)<br>  <br>  But don't go away feeling that I've been unfair to you.  We have our Pharisees, too -- religious people who stretch things to unreasonable or unfair extremes just so they can find fault and have power over other people.<br>  <br>  I have felt both God's love and the witness of truth of the Holy Ghost.  And yet I notice that I am capable of stringing two coherent sentences together.  I am also rather more intelligent than average, so don't even think of going there.<br>  <br>  God is as real as you are, and he's not going to go away just because you don't like him.  But don't worry.  He's a lot nicer than you are.|`|IFRZzYzraa	Your hypothesis is faulty and you make assumptions without documentation.

Also amusing is both sides trying to use scientific information to prove their points, which is absurd, because my proof  for something is someone else's proof against that same thing. <br>  <br>  It's really just a pointless waste of time trying to win people over with logic.<br>  <br>  Example: <br>  The bible is proof that there is a god, and that people who don't believe are insane. <br>  versus... <br>  The bible is proof that there isn't a god, and people just made it up... people who believe are insane. <br>  <br>  See? Pointless.|`|2jgiruBhaa	i can prove ur an  idiot!!|`|e8w2tX2Haa	"Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Phil.2:11.|`|pFs71HsHaa	I am not amused by it. I am saddened that you feel a need to disprove His existence instead of just believing as you will.<br>  <br>  (("No, we can't see these things - we can see their effects, though")),  We can see His effects also.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Look.  The only thing proven is that you doubt our proof.  And that you do not accept our evidence for proof.  Look in your last paragraph you say this.  <br>  <br>  "The Bible is not proof of anything whatsoever".  <br>  <br>  The Bible is proof of our faith in God and that what is written there is truth.  This book has over five thousand years of knowledge that has remained unchanged for two thousands years.  The Bible was not written yesterday or one hundred or five hundred or one thousand years ago. <br>  <br>  This type of question merely demonstrates an inability to accept what faith and spiritual truth are.
QPj1PTwgaa	its nice to not have to worry about money very much, but i don't like spending vast amounts and am careful about what i spend it on. i could have less money and still live the way i do as i don't spend that much and don't feel it neccessary for me to have the latest gadget or designer whatever. reaching my goals, and having a good time with my friends and just being kind and helpful towards people makes me feel good about myself.|`|yrkMVrbtaa	From what I have seen of my parents and their wealth. I would say no. They have plenty of $ and yet their totally miserable and never seem content with their homes, cars, and themselves. I, on the other hand am not rich but average and I am very content with my life. I don't need tons of money nor their money to make my life have importance.|`|p4u4i1JVaa	No it doesn't make me happy only love can.|`|BhEsZMG8aa	Yes on all counts
mhvb9eFkaa	It is the meal and traditional ceremonial gathering of families to remind the Jewish people of the exodus from Egypt during the time of the pharaoh.<br>  Here is the Wiki link:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Se...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	You can't find anything about Passover on the internet?  You can't be trying very hard.  All you have to do is put "passover" into the search window, and voilà!  Documents come up!|`|niyESblhaa	Passover is the holiday we jews celebrate about the time we were were in Egypt working for the Pharaoh. The foods we eat are:<br>  Bitter herbs (usually horseradish) dipped in salt to remember the bitterness the jews had to endure.<br>  Charoset is a sweet mixture of nuts, apples, wine, and cinnamon to represent the mortar used to build stuff in egypt.<br>  Parsley in salt water to represent the tears shed.<br>  Lamb shank bone to represent the lamb offered in Jerusalem.<br>  A boiled/roasted egg to represent the sacrifice offered in Jerusalem.<br>  4 glasses of wine to represent four-fold promise of redemption, with a special glass left for Elijah the prophet.<br>  Matzot is the unlevened bread. When the Jews fled Egypt they didn't have time to wait untill the bread levened so it remained a flat cracker-like bread.<br>  <br>  Passover is my favorite holiday. It gives to time to learn about your ansesctors and realize how lucky you are. After, all the kids search for the afikomen (a piece of matzot that a man hides for the kids to find) and if you find it you get a prize. We sing and dance and laugh untill usually 1 in the morning! This is my year to find the afikomen. (i've never found it. i'm 12) I can't wait!|`|TbI9FGQHaa	go to <br>  aish.com<br>  ohr.edu<br>  simpletoremember.com

But DO hold your head high and go to the gathering.  You didn't do anything wrong...they did.  Did you ever stop to think that THEY may be dreading this encounter more than YOU are?  Don't add insult to injury by having to rearrange your life everytime you think you're going to run into them.  Sometimes the only way to get past something is to go right through it.|`|rThIVk2maa	If you feel unable to contain your wrath in their presence, then the best thing you can do is absent yourself. Don't lie about why not, just say you won't be able to attend when you give your regrets. <br>  <br>  Or you can fake it as most polite people would do and just be civil to her anyway. Civil, not warm.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	I wish I had the BALLS to do this:<br>  don't let liars stop you from attending events.<br>  go to this event and loudly ask them why they lied about such and such, have witnesses and a back up plan (cos good liars can bluff their way out of anything)|`|zRPXczxAaa	You should excuse yourself, and not say that you don't feel well.  Say nothing.  If you've received a personal invitation, decline it with thanks.  Otherwise, if you try and put it out of your mind, I think you'll succeed in forgetting all about it.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	You dont act polite. You go, but you dismiss them with silence. You snub them so they know how you feel loud and clear.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	I would confront the person about the lie before the gathering in your home. There is no reason for you to not enjoy yourself as much as everyone else.... and there is no reason to allow someone to get away with lying to you. <br>  You dont have to be rude about the confrontation but you should let the person know that you know they lied and that you will not allow yourself to be around people who are untruthful.|`|TXddP0uxaa	Find a way to have sympathy.  People don't lie to you just to make you mad;  they must have some reason (even if it is a bad one).  Many times, people lie as a defense mechanism.  If you think of it that way, you may find you feel sorry for these people rather than be angry toward them.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember:  no one can MAKE you angry.  You CHOOSE to be angry.  When you feel this way, generally you hurt yourself more than you hurt anyone else by harboring this nasty feeling inside yourself.  Train yourself to feel apathy rather than anger.|`|j2U7WaPhaa	Try saying something that has nothing to do with what they lied about. Then gradually bring it into the conversation and discuss it with them. It's like having a camouflaged chameleon on a leaf and slowly take it off the leaf slowly.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I feel people should have consequences for their actions & wrong doings I would confront the person about the lie b/c why should you be the one who has to avoid situations  b/c of a liar If anything you deserve an apology for the lie|`|1fd9957e2ec9a7bf90a8eb7c7c9d3c47aa	If you don't feel comfortable around these people, don't go. Tell them you won't be able to attend. You needn't lie yourself by offering up a made up excuse.|`|zaYGRmOAaa	There's nothing saying that you have to give these people an exorbitant amount of attention...|`|tdQTZPI7aa	If you cannot act the part and keep smiling then yes offer up an excuse and stay home.  That is how I handle these type of mess
