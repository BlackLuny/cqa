AA11921320	The question of predetemination seems to be wrapped up in the mystery of time.  I don't believe everything is pre-decided but do know that many people experience precognition in one form or another.  I've had dreams that appear quite bizarre and really make no sense but weeks or months later I see them play out in exact detail.  I'm sure this happens to a lot of people.  Most of the psychics that we hear about give vague visions of a future which is entirely open to interpretation.  There is a lot of glamour attached to getting well known for predicting future events.  If any of us predicted enough things at least one or two would probably come to fruition.  So, how it works I know not but do believe it can happen but at the same time I doubt most of what the well known predictors have to say.|`|2641abf51d374e61d81e9b2e95cc3411aa	i go with wijnha01s' answer, so many predictions are made, and so many good excuses exist for being wrong, that when someone makes a "correct" prediction, it looks like evidence for precognition.     do an example, if i say that i am the worlds most dedicated weightlifter, is it true, if we only use the couple of instances in my life when ive lifted weights, but can discount all the other moments i have lived?    this is not to say that people can not know about the future, but no matter how much you know, or how accuratly you can predict something, there is always the possibility that it might not happen.|`|2d1e4705f305a62a59df53475e0f1434aa	The idea of precognitive people has been around for a ridiculous amount of time, but it does not mean that the future is predestined.  If you want to look at it in a deterministic view, then actions are only reactions to events in the past.  Nothing is ever random, and therefore, we are only bound by what happened in the past.  To a point, it seems like predestination, but it is all based on the first event that put everything into motion, which was random, thus making it not based on destiny.  Likewise, if you want to focus on the more excepted idea of free will, then psychics are only guessing what will happen based on the choices they think people will make.  To that point, psychics are only guessing based on loose facts(which would explain why they are quite often wrong) and again destiny does not exist.  Then again, I suppose I am only writing this because I was destined to...|`|651cfabbaf43d9c7e9108f2dd5e19b20aa	No I don't believe that everything is pre decided but there are people receptive enough to see things happen before they do and I believe that these people have a gift;are there to help and warn people;guide them in making the right choices.  Sometimes its just a matter of seeing things from a different perspective that brings out the right answers to future events.  I believe we all have a little esp; and sometimes ,meditating and soulful thinking enables us to vision not only for ourselves but others we spiritually connect with. However nature is part of fate and fate cannot be controlled; the monotony cycle of nature is obviously decided but can easily be interrupted by nature itself;the unbalance created by man and time....|`|AA11551627	All of the people have these psychic powers that you say.

i3pNwh0Xaa	Before they fought at Thermopylae, Sparta had allied with other city-states like Athens, Thebes, Arcadia, Corinth, and many others. But some city-states joined with Persia the big one being Argos, they joined Persian because of their hatred of Sparta. <br>  <br>  At the Battle of Thermopylae, there were 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, and about 5,600 other soldiers from other city-states, like Arcadia, Matinea (sp?), Corinth, Tegea etc. While they were fighting on land, Themistocles an Athenian was fighting a navel battle in the strait of Artemisium.|`|W8pEdLruaa	They had 700 Thespian volunteers. (greek)<br>  <br>  Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC, an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian Empire army at the pass of Thermopylae in central Greece. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the Persians for three days in one of history's most famous last stands. A small force led by King Leonidas of Sparta blocked the only road through which the massive army of Xerxes I could pass. After three days of battle, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King Leonidas stayed behind with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian volunteers. The Persians succeeded in taking the pass but sustained heavy losses, extremely disproportionate to those of the Greeks. The fierce resistance of the Spartan-led army offered Athens the invaluable time to prepare for a decisive naval battle that would come to determine the outcome of the war.[1] The subsequent Greek victory at the Battle of Salamis left much of the Persian Empire's navy destroyed and Xerxes I was forced to retreat back to Asia, leaving his army in Greece under Mardonius, who was to meet the Greeks in battle one last time. The Spartans assembled at full strength and led a pan-Greek army that defeated the Persians decisively at the Battle of Plataea, ending the Greco-Persian War and with it Persian Empire expansion into Europe.[2]
W8pEdLruaa	LOY, Cuco<br>  <br>      (b '37, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic) The sons of a carpenter, Cuco Valoy (singer, composer, arranger, producer) and his guitarist brother Martín began working as a duo (Los Ahijados, the Godsons) in the late '50s based on popular Cuban voice and guitar duos and trios of the time, many songs written by Cuco. 'Páginas Gloriosas' '65 ('Pages Of Glory'; available on Páginas Gloriosas, Adelante Soldados '94) was Cuco's patriotic hymn and the anthem of the short-lived 'constitutional revolution', suppressed by a military government helped by US Marines. 'I was young,' he says (now describing himself as apolitical); 'I identified with the impoverished and marginalized against the wealthy establishment in power ... but it was a long time ago.' (interviewed by Philip Sweeney in the Independent '93). They met leaders of the budding salsa boom in New York '71; Cuco formed a twelve-piece band '75 which he named both Los Virtuosos (the Virtuous) and La Tribu (the Tribe), changed to Nueva Tribu (New Tribe) when new members were added mid-'80s. The lineup included lead and chorus voices, rhythm section and a changing front line of one or two saxophones, two or three trumpets and frequently one trombone; personnel including the splendid vocalist Henry García (mid-'70s to mid-'80s), Martín on bass, and two of Cuco's 14 sons: Marcos Antonio Valoy (sometimes on trombone) and Ramón Orlando (Valoy, piano, musical director, arranger, composer, chorus singer). Ramón left mid-'80s and became a major Dominican star. Until then, Valoy featured a variety of salsa and merengue (the DR's predominate dance form) but then deviated from this rule on albums that were largely or totally merengue. Lots of his best material was scattered through albums on the Discolor and Kubaney labels '75-83, later compiled on the Kubaney CD collections: Sonero, El Brujo (Volumen 2), 20 Exitos De Los Ahijados (with Los Ahijados), La Salsa De Cuco Valoy -- 15 Exitos, Salsa Con Coco, Bien Sobao, Sonero Mayor and Cuco y Martín Valoy (with Los Ahijados) '87-94; annoyingly, just to confuse things, the '92 compilations Salsa Con Coco and Bien Sobao have the same titles and cover artwork as Valoy's '78 and '82 releases. His key albums on Discolor were Salsa Con Coco '78, Tremenda Salsa '78 (aka Cuco Valoy y su Tribu en Curazao), Arrollando '79 and Tiza! '80, the latter including what Sweeney described as the 'superbly melodramatic salsa thriller' 'Mendigo de Amor' ('Beggar Of Love').<br>  <br>      Cuco recorded for small firms '83-7, returning to Kubaney '88; treasures lurking among the mid-'80s albums include Cuco Valoy y su Tribu '84 on his own CVR label, Mejor Que Nunca '85 and Con Sabor del Tropico '86, both on Team. He made a substantial return to salsa on A Petición Popular Salsa '89, which was entirely arranged by Isidro Infante. Cuco reunited with Ramón on La Gran Obra Musical De Cuco Valoy '91 on J&N/Fuga Records; Infante was co-musical director, co-arranger and keyboardist on Valoy's last album on J&N, El Que Sabe! '92 and as co-arranger on Sabroso '93, his first on AVL. On Sabroso he returned to his first love, old Cuban songs; he told Sweeney it was the music he felt most deeply. Cuco settled in New Jersey '91, and with his Nueva Tribu was doing three to four gigs a week across North and South America in '93. Many of Cuco's more than 300 songs are about women, such as his monster hit 'Juliana' from Salsa Con Coco '78; 'I find it easy to write songs on the bitterness of love gone wrong because it's a part of the everyday life of ordinary people -- everybody recognizes it.' He acquired a nickname and an association with the Afro-Christian voodoo cult of santería with his merengue hit 'El Brujo' '77 ('The Wizard' from El Brujo '76, aka Corre, Policia, Corre!): a woman with a wayward husband uses a potion to bring him back. UK disc jockey Tomek decided '91 that Cuco really was a wizard, in 'his mastery of all elements of the Cuban-Dominican expression, ''merensalsa''. The immaculate swing of his band is informed by arrangements which never sacrifice the bittersweet diasporic tradition for specious modernism...' Further albums: Las Mujeres Calientes: Bachata, Merengue y Son '94 and Selección de Merengues '95 on AVL, Merengues Bombon '95 and Salsa Con Valoy '96 (compiles salsa tracks from '91-3 albums) on Mr Imperio.
TfxGL1luaa	I've never seen the play but I read it years ago.  Its an abstract piece about a boy's obsession with horses.  It delves into his mind and is certainly not a typical play and rather dark.  Yes, there is a nude scene, so yes, Daniel gets naked.  He said the reason he did this play was so people would stop thinking of him as the "potter boy".  He doesn't want to be typecasted or backed into a corner by the Harry character.  I thought the play was a great read.  I'd give it a 4.  I believe it also won a Pulitzer or some award for the writing.|`|4a8bb0048e0cb751126fcf2dc7b1f03aaa	Haven't seen the latest production, but:<br>  <br>  1) Most likely. Anything other than real nudity would undermine the impact of that particular scene.<br>  2) Good, yes, but disturbing would probably be a more accurate description.<br>  3) As Drew points out, he did this to try to separate himself from Harry Potter. I doubt it will work, but I also think he'll be able to move beyond Potter eventually.<br>  4) On the surface, it's about a psychiatrist's attempt to find out what drove a young man to blind several horses. But beyond that, it's a meditation on how things that are locked away in our subconscious influence our behavior, and how frightening that can be.<br>  5) I like it, I'll give it a 4.
P8qba7MTaa	Adolf Hitler wasn't in love with his mother, he was in love with his neice, Angela (or Angie) Raubal.  The had a relationship for many years until she commited suicide.  <br>  Many say that the reason she commited suicide was because she found a piece of paper that said "Thank you for a wonderful evening. -Eva Brown." As you might know, Eva Brown was the woman that would later become his wife.<br>  Others say that Adolf killed Angela because she was pregnant with a Jewish child (her music teacher was a Jewish man..).  <br>  Adolf Hitler loved children but never had any of his own because he was afraid that they would not be born healthy, since part of his family was Jewish...<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, I had to do a lot of research on A.

German veterans felt short changed and they could have won the war.<br>  <br>  Germany got the short end of the stick, even though the war ended in an 'armistice', Germany was treated as though it was the loser.  Germany had to fork over 75% of its heavy manufacturing equipment, pay a billion marks to France, and forced to become a 'democrary' - the Weimar Republic.  Germany never had a 'democratic tradition' and the Germans wanted their Kaiser, hated democrary, and despised the Weimar republic.<br>  <br>  Under democracy, which is absolute chaos to the rigid German principles of order & discipline, various government agents where sent out to observe all the anti-government radical groups which were appearing all over Germany.  A WWI German corporal, a veteran named of Adolf Hitler, became one of these government observers, a V-agent, and checked-out several different radical organizations.<br>  <br>  One day V-agent Adolf Hitler was assigned to observe a radical group called the DAP, Deutschers Arbeit Partei (the German Workers Party).  Hitler liked what he heard, joined this group as a member, and a year later Hitler renamed it the NSDAP, National Socialst Deutschers Arbeit Partei (the National Socialist German Workers Party).<br>  <br>  Years later, after becoming the President of the NSDAP, Adolf Hitler renamed the group the National Socialist Party, or Nazi Party.<br>  <br>  Hitler said he would use the weakness of democracy against itself, weaknesses like: free speech, freedom to assemble, freedom to protest, freedom to march, and the like.  Hitler marched all over the place against the hated Weimar Republic.  <br>  <br>  Hitler was involved in a 'putsch', a plot to over throw the government by force, which landed him in prison: Landsberg am Lech, and that is where he wrote his not so good book: MEIN KAMPF, or My Struggle or My Fight.<br>  <br>  After he got out of jail, Hitler decided to take the legal road to power so he ran for a seat in the German Parliment under his National Socialist Party (the Nazis).  After another few years of hard politics, Hitler was elected to parliment.  After Hindenburg died, Hitler combined the Chancerllorship and his party seat into a new office he called The Fuhrer: simply LEADER in German.<br>  <br>  The Fuhrer led Germany out of a deep economic depression.  Hitler treated his German people well (but not the enemies of the state), and spent a lot of money giving them things like the autobahn and the volkswagen.  Hitler was criticized as a Kenyesian economic defecit spender, which means he spent more money than he took in.  So Hitler had to invade other countries to make more money to spend on his people, he called this Lebensraum, or living space.<br>  <br>  Hitler was made Time Magazine's 1938 'Man of the Year'. <br>  <br>  In 1939 Adolf Hitler and the communist Josef Stalin signed a non-aggression pact, and Hiter and Stalin became buddies.  So Hitler and Stalin both invaded Poland, but England honored her treaty with Poland and declared war against Germany and Russia.  Stalin betrayed Hitler and sided with England and that's how WWII began.|`|AA11338148	Remember_The_Holocaust-subscribe@yahoogr...|`|fc51472af8df2e6665dbf451d664bcceaa	Try going to a library and reading books about it.|`|n7KeCsHxaa	internet research...we're not doing your homework.

37kwSHk7aa	That is one of my all time favorite books! And actually, it is supposed to disorient you. The author attempts to create in the reader the same feelings that the characters are experiencing. I think it's genius!! For instance, in the chapter pertaining to labyrinths,  you get so twisted up and convoluted trying to follow all the footnotes, footnotes inside footnotes, switchbacks, flip-forwards, and text that is literally shaped like a maze! It gives the reader a feeling of confusion, desperation, disorientation...it helps you relate to the character. <br>  However, i must add, i started reading 'Only Revolutions', and had a terrible time with it. It's structured with the same goals in mind, but it's so disjointed, i could make absolutely no sense of it. Oh well, try, try again.

Esta pergunta s tem uma resposta possvel: Louis Lumire. Foi ele, na verdade, que registrou, em 1895, um aparelho "que servia  obten??o e  vis?o das provas cronofotogrficas".  justo, no entanto, notar que, em 1891, j Edison apresentara o seu kinetoscpio.    H ainda hoje um kinetoscpio em Paris, no Museu de Artes e Ofcios.  uma grande caixa de madeira, no interior da qual vai passando uma fita de pelcula de 35 milmetros. Gra?as a uma janela aberta na parte superior da caixa, o espectador pode ver ndios a dan?ar a dan?a do escalpo, cow-boys a apanhar bfalos a la?o e, em primeiro plano, um atleta ent?o famoso, o professor Sandow, exibindo uns volumosos msculos peitorais.    Era isto que, trs anos antes de Lumire, Edison oferecia ao espectador americano. Em boa justi?a, n?o seria a ele que deveria atribuir-se o mrito da inven??o do cinema? N?o. Isto n?o era fotografia animada. N?o havia proje??o. O kinetoscpio de Edison s podia entreter um espectador de cada vez.

63d4554d70dc50c800682c87b5c6fa76aa	Donatien Alphonse Fran?ois de Sade, mais conhecido como Marqus de Sade (Paris, 2 de junho de 1740; Saint-Maurice, 2 de dezembro de 1814) foi um aristocrata francs e escritor marcado pela pornografia violenta e pelo desprezo dos valores religiosos e morais. Muitas das suas obras foram escritas enquanto estava na pris?o, encarcerado por causa de seus escritos e de seu comportamento. De seu nome surge o termo mdico sadismo, que define a pervers?o sexual de ter prazer na dor fsica ou moral do parceiro ou parceiros. Foi perseguido tanto pela monarquia (Ancien Rgime) como pelos revolucionrios vitoriosos de 1789 e depois por Napole?o.    A filosofia do crime Alm de escritor e dramaturgo, foi tambm filsofo de idias originais, baseadas no materialismo do sculo das luzes e dos enciclopedistas. Era adepto do atesmo e obcecado por fazer apologia do crime e afrontas  religi?o dominante. Em seu romance 'Os 120 Dias de Sodoma', por exemplo, nobres devassos abusam de crian?as raptadas encerrados num castelo de luxo, num clima de crescente violncia, com coprofagia, mutila??es e assassinatos - verdadeiro mergulho nos infernos, sem nenhuma concess?o ao bom-gosto. Esse romance foi produzido na cadeia, manuscrito em letras midas num rolo feito de papis colados, e teve sugest?es dadas pela mulher do marqus, Renn, que passou parte da vida defendendo o marido nos tribunais e s se separou dele quando o marqus foi libertado da cadeia, num breve intervalo de vida livre ps-Revolu??o Francesa.    Justine e Juliette Duas personagens criadas por Sade foram suas idias fixas durante dcadas: Justine (que se materializou em vrias vers?es de romance, ocupando muitos volumes), a ingnua defensora do bem, que sempre acaba sendo envolvida em crimes e deprava??es, terminando seus dias fulminada por um raio que a rompe da boca ao anus quando ia  missa, e Juliette, sua irm?, que encarna o triunfo do mal, fazendo uma sucess?o de coisas abjetas, como matar uma de suas melhores amigas lan?ando-a na cratera de um vulc?o ou obrigar o prprio papa a fazer um discurso em defesa do crime para poder t-la em sua cama. As orgias com o papa Pio VI em plena Igreja de S?o Pedro, no Vaticano, fazem parte da trama sacrlega e ultrajante do romance 'Juliette', com a fala do pontfice transformada em agressivo panfleto poltico: 'A Disserta??o do Papa sobre o Crime'. Sade tinha o costume de inserir panfletos poltico-filosficos em suas obras. O panfleto 'Franceses, mais um Esfor?o se Quiserdes Ser Republicanos', que prega a total ruptura com o cristianismo, foi por ele encampado ao romance 'A Filosofia na Alcova', no qual um casal de irm?os e um amigo libertino seqestram e pervertem uma menina, fazendo-a matar empalada a prpria m?e que tenta resgat-la no final.    Pioneiro da revolu??o sexual Alm de patrono do surrealismo, Sade  considerado um dos pioneiros da revolu??o sexual, com suas idias libertrias e permissivas, e um dos primeiros a ter uma vis?o moderna da homossexualidade, pois defende a existncia de diferentes condi??es sexuais para a humanidade. Em 'Os 120 Dias de Sodoma', chega a satirizar o predomnio do pensamento heterossexual e a milenar condena??o  morte de comportamentos considerados desviantes: no romance, ele inverte a situa??o e dessa vez humilha a heterossexualidade, que  punida com a morte pelas regras libertinas do castelo em que se realizam as excrementosas, sangrentas e incestuosas orgias, regadas a homossexualidade e sodomia. A obra de Sade, constantemente proibida, serviu de base para a 'Psychopathia sexualis' de Kraft-Ebing, que classificou as parafilias e incluiu nelas o sadismo, conceito que tambm seria muito importante para Freud e seus seguidores, como Melanie Klein, em cuja obra o termo sadismo costuma ser exaustivamente repetido. Hoje considerado um clssico maldito, pois passou quase trinta anos preso mais por suas idias e por seu comportamento sexual do que por seus crimes, Sade s come?ou a ser valorizado pelos surrealistas, no come?o do sculo 20.    Surrealismo e psicanlise Tanto o surrealismo como a psicanlise encamparam a vis?o da crueldade egosta que a obra de sade exp?e despudoradamente. Um exemplo de influncia do marqus de Sade na arte do sculo 20  o cineasta espanhol Luis Bu?uel, que em vrios filmes faz referncias explcitas a Sade: em 'A Idade do Ouro', por exemplo, retrata a sada de Cristo e dos libertinos do castelo das orgias de 'Os 120 Dias de Sodoma'. O sadismo tambm est explcito nas imagens mais surrealistas produzidas por Bu?uel, como a navalha cegando o olho da mulher em O C?o Andaluz. Tambm h fortes referncias sadianas em A Bela da Tarde e em 'Via Lctea', no qual aparece uma Cena em que Sade converte uma indefesa menina ao atesmo. A influncia de Sade pode ser notada tambm em autores como o dramaturgo francs Jean Genet, homossexual, ladr?o e presidirio, que retoma muitos dos temas do marqus, tambm desenvolvidos em ambientes carcerrios franceses.    Sade era gay? A quest?o da suposta homossexualidade de Sade ("Ter sido Sade um pederasta?") foi formulada pela escritora francesa Simone de Beauvoir no clssico ensaio ' preciso Queimar Sade? - Privilgios'. A autora conclui pela heterossexualidade de Sade, que sempre amou mulheres tolerantes a suas aventuras, embora tivesse um comportamento sexual atpico, defendendo o coito anal e chegando a pagar criados para sodomiz-lo publicamente em suas orgias, das quais a primeira mulher, Renn de Sade, teria participado. Atualmente, estudiosos da cultura e da literatura, como o jornalista Ottaviano de Fiore, professor da Pontifcia Universidade Catlica de S?o Paulo (PUC-SP), compartilham a opini?o de Simone de Beauvoir, creditando o comportamento e a imagina??o literria do autor de 'Os 120 Dias de Sodoma' a neuroses relacionadas a parafilias, como o gosto pelo lixo e|`|c653b3a77dc0e540d73427c32600609baa	Donatien Alphonse Fran?ois de Sade, mais conhecido como Marqus de Sade (Paris, 2 de junho de 1740; Saint-Maurice, 2 de dezembro de 1814)   Em 15 de novembro de 1956 iniciava-se um processo criminal em Paris, o ru, Donatien Alphonse Fran?ois, ou melhor, o Marqus de Sade, tambm conhecido como Divino Marqus por uma pequena parcela de intelectuais e artistas. Tal processo fora iniciado devido  tentativa de um editor - Jean Pauvert - de lan?ar em edi??o as obras completas do Marqus. O tribunal mostrava-se contrrio, porquanto desde o incio do sculo XIX as obras mais picantes de Sade eram tidas como capazes de destruir o corpo e a alma de qualquer leitor.    Entretanto depois de as acusa??es serem apresentadas, aceitou-se o contato do pblico com a inteligncia selvagem do Marqus. De acordo com sua filosofia alternativa, escrita durante o perodo que esteve recluso, nenhum Deus, moralidade, afei??o e esperan?a deveriam existir, apenas a extin??o humana num delrio ertico terminal. O homicdio, a sodomia, o incesto etc., seriam os meios capazes para a obten??o desse fim. A partir disso, considerou-se que o fulcro da obra sadeana fosse a pervers?o, porm, o constante aparecimento da Providncia - Deus - em todas as suas obras, desmascara o verdadeiro ponto principal: o atesmo intelectual, sendo o nico Deus a natureza, para a qual segundo Sade, o bem e o mal n?o s?o aspectos antag?nicos, mas sim essenciais para a manuten??o do equilbrio.|`|74552c5a0bdfe9e838cbb02ee85eb10baa	Esse cara eu conhe?o hehehe.

Na Fran?a religiosa do sculo XVIII, Sade foi o primeiro a mostrar ao Homem, atravs da sua pena eloquente, a ilus?o irrisria da sua condi??o humana, a ambiguidade da religi?o e as virtudes do erotismo. No entanto, n?o foram estes temas que chocaram o Mundo. Foi sobretudo a maneira como os contava: em tramas prfidas, lascivas e pronogrficas. Claro que o fruto proibido  sempre o mais apetecido e mesmo que tenha passado a vida em crceres, as prosas do Marqus de Sade foram sempre procuradas por um pblico estimulado.
AA11921320	The Aquarian is someone who has shifted his focus from selfishness and individual interest to the good of the whole.  He is a true servant to the human race.  This can, of course, be in any area that assists mankind, science, politics, medicine, teaching, etc.  His attention lies on what is best for the group instead of what is best for the individual.  I've met a few teachers whom I'd consider Aquarian.  They teach to rely on inner authority of the soul and to focus on what's best for all.    A couple quotes:  "Just as, during the Piscean Age, there was unfolded in humanity a mass responsiveness to knowledge and to the principle of intelligence, so in the Aquarian Age, a mass response to right relations will equally be evoked, and goodwill (as its expression) will be distinctive of the mass consciousness."    "This coming age will be as predominantly the age of group interplay, group idealism and group consciousness as the Piscean Age has been one of personality unfoldment and emphasis, personality focus and personality consciousness. Selfishness, as we now understand it, will gradually disappear, for the will of the individual will voluntarily be blended into the group will.

Don't worry my friend we will be soon enough...|`|AA10509126	In a way you are correct but think about it the other way. What if you lived your daily life and you had no choices to act on your feelings the way you do or to say the words you wanted/needed to say? I think without choice you would be a miserable person ALL of the time.  Sometimes we make choices in life and they turn out not the be the right one.  We learn from those choices (sometimes). If we are upset about a choice we made because it turned out with negative results, that can be fixed. We may be unhappy for a short period of time but with NO choice, you are destined to be unhappy ALL of the time.|`|16786f3a7d4f8157d10a9dc7e837f974aa	Well, for a Libra like me, it is hell.  Not that I would like anyone else deciding for me, not at all. But I find it so hard to make choices, I sometimes seem to be stuck at the same stage of my life for ages. I wish life were simpler but then... maybe I am yet to discover its multi-faceted beauty....|`|AA11012320	i don't know i cant decide you gave me to many  choices|`|AA11219693	I guess this is true - a lack of opportunities to choose can bring out the best in us surprisingly well. This I think is due to specific human nature. Our mind is capable to deal with countless possibilities of this endless world. It actually thrives upon possibilities as they provide a catalyst for curiosity and sense of wonder that mind uses to expand and stay awake.  But when it comes to choosing between things has become possible for us majority of us feel baffled and even perplexed.  We simply do not know well how to give up many things while we choose few. This could be because we feel sense of lose related to giving up.     I have known people who keep their option open all the time and do not make choices. Any situation of choice for them is a situation of lose and therefore mental agony and torture. They will keep heaps of odd things and articles of occasional use at home for years with ever having to use them - just in case, just as a precautionary measure. Some people are in fact just hoarders of options. They sit on options. They do waste them or use them. And they regularly keep toping up their dearly collect stock. They just like to have options available - just in case they need them sometimes.    But life can get really complicated when we are unable to move on in our relations and we fail to make choices, we fail to make our position clear because emotional choices are the most difficult to make. I have known many people to stay tied up in relations that bring them no happiness or benefit just because they can mot make a choice.|`|00ccd3847b88b1febc4dab8c2e81bdb2aa	If you had no choice in "life":, you would had no "choices" in your life.

The key to avoiding complications is to decide, to choose, then to move forward with the choice.  It is stressful to linger too long trying to make the best decision.|`|66852b24953becf371d68ac44a863c11aa	definitely not. choice is a gift given only to human beings... with choice, we can exercise our potentialities to the fullest. in other words, we can become what we want - if we want to be a doctor, we can considering our freedom and that is our choice, but can dog be a doctor? no. with the example, we can see how lucky human beings with the gift of freedom to choose.  another thing is that, if man is not blessed with freedom - we can be just like robots, following to what Someone wishes.  maybe we can say that "life is too complicated with choice" - because it depends on how we understand or perceive things. for example: a ladder - we can see it as a means to go up and we can also see it as a means to go down, clearly it depends on what situation are you into.   one should be glad if one sees a lot of choices or alternatives - it means that one is being open to what things may become... =) not all are like that... =)|`|01113203244bf4e1b6aa6b8a892a49dfaa	Life would not be life, but mere (animal) living without choice.|`|AA12387563	Rather the life is made easy through varying choices.

01d8c865f7f4793b48f1de0c2c55e1f8aa	For a good quality transcript done by someone who cares about the end product you are looking at anywhere from $50 to $100 per audio hour. So just to be on the safe side you best have a budget of about $3800 for this project. You'll get offers from people who say they will do it for $20 per audio hour and you will smile and think how great that you can find it so cheap. However, before you accept an offer like that you need to consider are they offshore (basically someone who is English second language-ESL) which means they will need major proofing and editing work which makes that $20 per audio hour not go very far considering all the clean up you have to do. Anyway, I would offer my services but I think you need to consider all your options before deciding on what you are going to do.

The words chosen seem like they were chosen just to rhyme, not to tell a story.  +Watch out for your rhythm-- you don't want too many syllables in one line. (stanza 2 suddenly switches from long lines to short and abrupt ones)  +Try to keep the "I'm that girl" repetition (you skipped out stanza 4), but make sure it still flows.  +Look for a more advanced word choice, the limited vocabulary makes the poem less exciting.|`|ELCJQXMraa	thats a great poem!|`|FCDLP2pGaa	that was really good|`|ufThxTW0aa	it's pretty good, well done! personally I don't like poems that rhyme, but you can tell that you put a lot of effort into this poem! keep writing!! xxx

yuuvBSKsaa	Never saw the 'rape' part...    ....but there's a number of verses that approve of infidel death in general. e.g.    "And when the sacred months are past, kill those who join other gods with God wherever you shall find them, seize them & besiege them and lay in wait for them with every kind of ambush:  but if they convert, and observe prayer, and pay the obligitory alms, let them go their way, for God is Gracious, Merciful.   Sura 9:5    JFTR "other gods with God"  would be saying Jesus is God.  Remember, while the Muslims rever Jesus as a prophet & the son of God, they hold his deification as the sacrilige of Polytheism, hence Christians are infidels.    Also, while the Qu'ran speaks much about peace, justice & the Mercy of God,  it's pretty clear that this is meant for Muslims only.   Muslims are 'allowed' to kill infidels for the slimist of provocations.    Now both the Qu'ran & Bible say women should be wives & mothers, which some feminists have questionably interpreted the insinuation of second class citizenship.     But the Qu'ran goes further. by stating that to convict someone in court you need the testimony of 2 men OR 1 man & 2 women.   Women are also etitled to 1/2 the inheritance that men are, so it's hard not to come away from the Qu'ran without the impression that women are worth half what men are.    But don't take everyone's word for it.  Give the book a read, that way neither the Muslims or the PC crowd can lie to you about it what's in it.|`|UtzALxfjaa	Yes. But that was written a long time ago. It was true back then, but not true now. Muslims respect people with other cultures.|`|5O7op0oIaa	Er, no. That's not true. The Koran explicitly details how one has to behave in foreign countries, and raping/killing hte inhabitants conspicuously fails to make the list.|`|w6Lu2Oesaa	you can always read the qur'an to be sure|`|1Gm1m30qaa	No, early Islam was actually quite Liberal for example women were allowed to divorce their husbands.|`|djCuzQhvaa	i to have heard this! cant say i was surprised though with how some muslims act|`|qvYTw3JHaa	no this is nt true i am a muslim myself and i am only 12 but i know this is not true it says in no islamic book that women shld b raped or kill. Just cos sum muslim people did stuff wrong it dosn't mean all muslim are like that. so pls bcareful wif wat u say.|`|mOa7cGlAaa	no, it is not true   before and know  however, you may see some people do like that and put it to islam (and their not the realy Muslim).|`|BJFeIjvpaa	oh my goodness, i just cant believe i read that,i think i vomited a little in my throat.  wow, no it does NOT say that, there is not even one line in the Quran that even says that,thats disgusting.    where did you read that sort of information? b/c its not even accurate,you probably read it in some anti-islam some biased sh*t.    please,theres a level of how gullible you can be, and just plain ignorant.|`|QWky1BgDaa	It's not true, just propaganda. You can read the Qu'ran you're self online. There are loads of sites with it translated.    The Bible has some petty bad questionable thing in it too; the man who went to collect fire wood on the Sabbath was stoned to death!|`|0iTNDPzoaa	It is not right to kill or rape woman. The Quran says to kill one person is like to kill all of mankind. (5.32)   In Islam you cannot have relation outside marriage so how can rape be allowed?? (17.32)    If a Muslim is under attack because of their religion it is permitted to act in defence. There is a verse called Al-Kafirun ( The unbelievers). It states they have their religion and Muslims have theirs so leave them to their beliefs and let Muslims have theirs. ( Chapter 109)    Best way to read the Quran or any quote is to read a few verse before and after  the verse in mind so you get the concept of what is explained with reasons.        If you want to say you read such and such please back up with relevant chapters and verse number. All Qurans are the same so we can easy refer to it for reference.    What you read is not accurate.|`|mmnkMU5paa	That's untrue.  Mohammed's Qu'ran or Koran is just as strongly in favor of the Mosaic 10 Commandments, as is the Jewish Torah (which Christians call The Old Testament) or the Christian Bible.  And most everyone knows that murder and rape are against the 10 Commandments.    Islam (submission to God's Will) is an interresting religion and should be, even to most Christians and Hebrews, because in their respective Old Testament, or Torah, Islam seems to be predicted in Genesis, where one of God's Angels says to Hagar, Sarah's and Abraham's maidservant, quote    ANGEL:  'Agar, made of Sarai [who later became Sarah when she became pregnant with Isaac], where have you come from and where are you going?  She answered    HAGAR:  "I am fleeing from my mistress, Sarai."  The angel of the Lord said to her,    ANGEL:  "Return to your mistress and submit to her authority."  The angel added. "I will multiply your posterity that it shall be too many to count."  The angel of the Lord also said to her, "You are with child, and shall bear a son; you shall call him Ismael, because the Lord has heard of your humiliation.  He shall be a wild *** of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone's hand against him; he shall dwell apart, opposing all his kinsmen.  [Genesis Ch. 16. vss. 8 - 12.]    So Hagar returned to Sarai and submitted to her authority.  But then Sarah became annoyed that Ismael was making "sport" of Isaac (perhaps teasing him) and turned both Hagar and Ismael out into the desert, with only a bottle of water and some bread given them by Abraham.  Then we read    When the water in the bottle was gone she left the child under a bush.  Then she went and sat opposite the place at about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, "Let me not see the child die."  As she sat opposite the child cried aloud.  God heard the boy's cry and the angel of God called to Agar from heaven and said to her    ANGEL:  "What is the matter, Agar?  Fear not; for God has heard the boy's cry in this plight of his.  Rise up, take the boy, be assured in his regard, for I will make him a great nation.  [Genesis 21; vss. 15-18].    So there are 2 promises from an angel of God to make a great nation of Ismael, in both the Hebrew Torah and the Christian Old Testament.    Personally I think of Islam as the religion of Abraham, Isaac and Ismael, whereas Judaism is the religion of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob.   Serious Muslims, who live in the desert, and actually believe, are closer to Abraham, and his way of life, than any modern Hebrew, Christian or Muslim.  And if you believe your own Torah or Old Testament, you pretty well have to believe that God said he would make a Great Nation out of the descendants of Ismael.    God arguably did so, by means of Mohammed's Revelation known as the Qu'ran, where the religions of all "People of The Book" are respected, so long as the people actually follow their "own books" and their own respective prophets.    In short, no true Hebrew, Christian or Muslim believes from any of their respective "books" (Scriptures)  that murder or rape are ever Allah's or God's will.  The same thing goes for most non-believers as well.  So when people say ignorant things about the Koran, get a copy of the Book and SEE FOR YOURSELF, as did Hagar, where God made promises to her, and kept them.    Kevin|`|wCOZsbnBaa	It doesn't say rape is right as such, but in the context of war/conflict capturing women and using them for sex slaves is not denounced, if not condoned.     This is not just anti-Islamic propaganda, such things are present in the bible also. Obviously this doesn't mean to say religious people on the whole condone rape, violence or whatever, they will say you have to look at the historical context in which their sacred text was written - a time where the importance of an individual's consent was not always considered necessary when it came to sexual activity. This is just the way things were, I am not being biased.     I will give you two links so you can read the verses yourself and make up your on mind on them.    http://www.danielpipes.org/comments/3990...    http://www.israelforum.com/board/showthr...    ( Just to note, both of the people on the sites have come to their own conclusions, I couldn't find any neutral references...unsurprisingly! )      I hope this helps.|`|FoIxsunVaa	The quran actually treats women as equal to men. All this covering up stuff and second class citizen BS is just cultural distortions of Islam. The quran is actually the LEAST sexist holy book in existence (that I know of.)

Your parents, your Friends your enemies. You choose all the major events in your life, just not the order that they come in. I have had terrible things occur in my life, some of them horrific, but in knowing that I have chosen them, that gives me the the power to know that these awful things have happened for a purpose. Please don't get me wrong, my life is full of wonderful things too. So all the bad things have happened to teach me something, as well as the good. Everything that I have experienced has made me the man that I am today, and I am quite content with the person that I am. Is that fate? Or is that Destiny? Or as Forest Gump says, "Perhaps a bit of both".|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	I don't believe in fate, but I do in destiny.  I also feel a lot of life, not everything, is predetermined.

If I were to believe in fate and destiny now... I would say that there are many paths that we choose to walk down... and I think that each path leads us to a new changed fate. I think we control it. But of course cant control everything.

I believe in reincarnation, so as we cycle in and out of our earthly existence, we keep gathering information and building on it.  But karma creates obstacles that derail most people.    Everything we do will be done to us and everything always evens out in the end.  That is why bad things happen to good people.  As we evolve spiritually, we open doors that reveal our destiny.  It takes a lot of faith to keep going past karmic debt and the disappointment of life to reach for knowledge beyond what is known.    Fate is set, while destiny is a goal.  Fate will put you at the right place at the right time to align what must be.  Humans are predictable in their thoughts and actions, so it is easy to herd us to a certain end.  The wild cards are those who seek knowledge beyond the know because once they get past the limitations of incarnation, they reach an understanding of why we are here and what our purpose truly is.  Then we act upon it.  That is destiny.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	There is no such thing as fate or destiny.    You create your own life.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Our lives are predestined by God.

Gente con la economia sufciente tambien compran por inversion, compran obras de pintores con carreras en ascenso o porque son un mercado seguro... aunque es una inversion a largo plazo.... quien compro un Botero hace veinte a?os sabe que tiene un valor tremendo que sobrepasa el invertido.  Te digo, de todos modos que el gusto se educa... si vas a comprar un original, algo que ya tiene cierto precio es bueno que compres algo verdaderamente "bueno" (en arte esto es algo dificil de determinar) .  Tambien tienes que tener en cuenta la durabilidad de la pieza de acuerdo a lo que cueste... hay quien ha comprado cuadros en la calle en Haiti y Cuba porque le parecen buenos ( o al menos folkloricos) y baratos pero debido a los pocos recursos de algunos artistas en esos lugares el lienzo esta mal preparado, la pintura es pesima y no pasan dos a?os y se echa a perder, claro que eso corresponde con el precio pagado...  Si te mueves entre artistas es bueno comprarle directo pues asi evitas pagar el porciento del intermediario pero tambien se complican las cosas porque no puedes conocer a todos los pintores que te gustan asi que puedes necesitar a ese intermediario o galeria adonde vas y escoges....  Ten en cuenta el montaje de la obra, como lo vas a enmarcar si lo necesita y el espacio donde ira, publico, de cierta clientela o cual rincon de la casa, a veces necesitamos imagenes agresivas, o en otras cosas relajantes y ambos polos tienen muchas maneras diferentes de exponerse tanto color, el tema... nos pueden inquietar como tranquilizar.|`|f945bc2d0e08ee94473d3ae589c6ec41aa	En lo que sientas tu frente a la obra de arte y fundamentalmente si te gusta.

A los trece a?os entr en el taller de Domenico Ghirlandui, donde aprendi la tcnica de pintura al fresco. Su propia poca divulgo varios mitos sobre su precosidad como artista. Su arte se basa en los modelos de la Antigedad Romana y en la imitacin de la naturaleza, experimenta con su inclusin en disciplinas especulativas como la filosofa.      Primero desarroll su trabajo en el crculo de Lorenzo el Magnfico en Florencia, y antes de fallecer en la Corte Papal de Roma.  (1)    ----------------    1.- OCEANO.

(Hoy en da la guerra sera un medio que nadie se atrevera a elegir para no morir).    Los escritores clebres encuentran la inmortalidad a travs de sus obras. (Hay que tener una mente brillante para crear una obra trascendente).    El cristianismo propone una buena vida en la tierra basada en las buenas obras, la honestidad, el amor y la humildad para que las puertas del cielo no se encuentren cerradas en el momento que la muerte fsica nos llegue.     Otra forma de alcanzar la inmortalidad sera que se hallara el elixir de la vida. (Siendo realista, eso pasa slo en la literatura, en aquellas novelas fantsticas que con tan slo poseer la piedra filosofal nos convertimos en inmortales).    El recuerdo de tu persona a travs de los a?os es el nico medio para que en cierta forma no mueras...(mi opinin).

	The film was somewhat cartoonish, and the forty foot tall elephants didn't help any. But the basic story line is more or less correct. The 300 Spartans had three or four times that number of Helots for support, and ignores the armies of the other city states that were present, but the battle in the narrow confines of the pass is just that, and you're talking about a shield wall the length of the pass, heavily armored and several ranks deep. Only an equivalent number could be arrayed against them at any one time, and without the heavy armor.  Actually, this film is the first I've seen that showed an actual shield wall in action as they probably really worked, though that lasted only about three seconds before they went into the usual movie contrivance of breaking ranks into a free-for-all sword fight.|`|	The non-Spartan Greeks, like, 10,000-strong, made a much bigger appearance in the battle than is suggested by the film, fighting hard until the last day, when they evacuated under Leonidas's orders. And Xerxe's army was only about 100,000. Also, much of his leadership was focused on fighting the "lovers of boys", the Athenians, at sea around the port of Artemisia.    And, of course,the Spartans wore breastplates and skirts, not just thongs. The elephants, rhinos, inbred halfwit giants, and grenades could've been there, but we might never know. Weird pets, odd-looking servants, and bizarre technology are things that the Persian Emperor, the Egyptians Pharoah, and others are well-documented for keeping collections of.|`|	300 Spartans in the rear guard held off the Persian army in a narrow pass until they were wiped out. There might have been an elephant engraved on some jewellery. That's as close as the film came close to the truth.   They forgot to mention that it was after three days of battle during which the Greek army led by Leonidas fought the Persians and that 700 Thespian, 400 Thebans and perhaps a few hundred others stayed with the Spartians. As well, no rhino was ever used in battle. That's only a few of the truth. And, oh, yes, the Persian emperor was never a half giant wrapped in gold fishnet and wearing a thong.|`|	To what degree was it even remotely historically accurate?
OFA2LAM5aa	Hungary comes from the word Hun.  Huns were a Central Asian equestrian semi-nomadic people who ventured deep into to Europe to establish settlements and interbred with the local populations.    The Tartars, were a Turkic-Persian (Iranians) people who also settled deep into the interiors of Europe.    The Mongols were a Northeast Asian nomadic people who conquered the largest land empire the world had ever seen, including most of Eastern Europe.  They ruled for 300 years and their offspring populated the regions from Russia to the present day Czech Republic.    On the other side of the story, Arab traders had been venturing to Asia for nearly 1500 years. Reaching the Korean peninsula and writing that it was a "Land where the mountains are covered in mist."    Today Eastern Europeans are mix of many different Asiatic and Turkic people.  Russians call Europe,  "Eurasia" since there really isn't two continents geological but one giant continent that spans from the English Channel to the Pacific Ocean and south into Turkey connected to the Middle east.  Asia also has people who have Turkic ancestors, particularly the Uighurs in western China.|`|ooopNW0oaa	The history of Hungary starts in the 9th century with the arrival of the Magyars in the Carpathian Basin. They spoke, like modern Hungarians, an Uralic language belonging to the Finno-Ugric language group. Their original composition probably included Iranian and Turkish people, while other populations were already present in the territory (Avars, Slavs, Germans). Some of the Hungarian ethnic groups claim to be descendants of ancient Magyars settlers (such as the Orsg), others of Huns, Turks or Iranians. We collected and compared the previously published gene frequencies of eight ethnic groups and seven hypothetical ancestral populations, including Uralics, applying a model of admixture. The results, most of which confirm historical hypotheses or the oral tradition, show that only one ethnic group (Orsg) highly resembles the Uralic population.|`|zTQaREymaa	Originally yes, but keep in mind environmental influences over the 1000s of years.|`|OLcXtWQyaa	the Hungarian and Finnish languages (Finno-Ugrian) originated east of the Urals. this doesn't necessarily mean modern speakers of these languages do. you speak English, yet you are not English, right?

They should use their youthful looks to find love because if they don't they will soon find their looks have faded and that nobody wants to be with them anymore.|`|DqI6vI6Qaa	In the society back then, women were used mainly as, excuse me for saying this, breeders. Their whole purpose was to get married and have kids, or else they would be considered failures. So basically it's saying women should find a husband before she gets too old and no one wants to marry her. (For if too long she may delay, her chance at love may pass away)|`|boAnw4Oyaa	Its easier for a woman to fall in love when she is younger and in a ripe stage of beauty as opposed to older and after her looks have begun to fade.
nQ3kFPMVaa	I think this no-training thing is bullshit. A friend of mine, who has had no formal training wanted to get into a local (big) film. He spent a lot of his money, did some workshops, learned a new accent with a trainer, and got an agent. He did the hard work, and actually landed a speaking role in this film; one in which most actors in my town were auditioning for. The point is, that without the training he wouldn't have been able to compete with the people who were auditioning.     I think this idea that all you need is 'talent' is just naivety. True, there's no 'one method' to acting; you do what works for you. But there is a need to train, and the concept that famous actors don't do any training at all is crap. They spend hours learning new accents, special skills (like horseriding or magic), spend hours with physical trainers and choreographers... and it all makes them more likely to get a role. Directors want people who are flexible and have many skills, and those who have more training are more likely to be like that.    I would also add that getting formal education also does one other thing; it says to the director or agent that the actor is taking the art seriously, that they have dedication enough to stick to a course and not drop out, etc; it all implies that the actor can handle grueling hours, and heavy schedule, and the hard emotional and physical work that goes into making a good performance. Someone who has 'talent' but little to no experience doesn't quite make the same impression.|`|v0M85GCAaa	Acting is one of those fields that still doesn't actually require traditional training.  It's not a science, so there isn't much of an emphasis on getting a degree in theater. Talent and appearance are the bigger driving factors.  People with impressive backgrounds, though, do get more attention.|`|oa3VMgcWaa	It's a hard choice considering there are so many examples of people finding success without training, you can learn the basics on your own just by doing plays, there are people that are just natural talents and then again some people are just lucky.  Plus you really don't have to be all that skilled and you still might be successful just because you have the right look.     Trained actors (or those that keep working on their craft) will have a better chance at a longer career and a better chance of getting diverse roles.  But I think the people you're talking about are not looking for that, they have stars in their eyes and are not really concerned about the art.    Most agents don't care how much training you have, they just want actors they can book.|`|3arJsZ91aa	It is because we are living in an "I want it now"  society.  People don't want to put in the hard work.  They think just getting an agent will be their door to fame and fortune.  I am tired of seeing questions asking "How do I get an agent with no experience" and "how do I audition for Disney".  People don't consider the fact that experience and training will get you a much better agent who will put you up for suitable roles.  Of course it is possible to get into the business without training, but it takes a lot of hard work and dedication.

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet.    Websites that only have family trees are not worth a plug nickel unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.    I recently found I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1956. Hey! we've been dead for 52 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!    I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.    This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.    Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.     Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.     Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.    However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.    Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.     A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.     They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	You might be. The easiest way is to get elected President. If you don't take that route, it is a research project. It isn't rocket science - anyone who can get a "B" in high school history has enough skill - but it does take time. If you are a non-Hispanic white American, you can probably get back to people alive in 1850 with 100 - 300 hours of work, spread out over as many nights and weekends as you choose.    You usually dead end with people alive in 1870 if you are black, and with the people who immigrated if you are Hispanic.    You have some excellent answers with links already.|`|AA11053540	Many libraries have genealogy departments, and allow patrons free access to genealogy.com or one of the others.  Here is my short list:  You should start by asking all your living relatives about family history. Then, armed with that information, you can go to your public library and check to see if it has a genealogy department. Most do nowadays; also, don't forget to check at community colleges, universities, etc. Our public library has both www.ancestry.com and www.heritagequest.com free for anyone to use (no library card required).  Another place to check out is any of the Mormon's Family History Centers. They allow people to search for their family history (and, NO, they don't try to convert you).  A third option is one of the following websites:  http://www.searchforancestors.com/...     http://www.censusrecords.net/?o_xid=2739...     www dot usgenweb dot com/     www dot census dot gov/     http://www.rootsweb.com/     www dot ukgenweb dot com/     www dot archives dot gov/     http://www.familysearch.org/     http://www.accessgenealogy.com/...     http://www.cyndislist.com/     www dot geni dot com/    Cyndi's has the most links to genealogy websites, whether ship's passenger lists, ancestors from Africa, ancestors from the Philippines, where ever and whatever.    Of course, you may be successful by googling: "john doe, born 1620, plimouth, massachusetts" as an example.    Good luck and have fun!    Check out this article on five great free genealogy websites:    www dot associatedcontent dot com/article...    Then there is the DNA test; if you decide you want to REALLY know where your ancestors came from opt for the DNA test. Besides all the mistakes that officials commonly make, from 10% to 20% of birth certificates list the father wrong; that is, mama was doing the hanky-panky and someone else was the REAL father. That won't show up on the internet or in books; it WILL show up in DNA.  I used www.familytreedna.com which works with the National Geographics Genotype Program.    As to "I might be related to some royalty or something", the answer is yes. Why do I say that? If you read a good history book, you know that many peasants starved to death before their children could grow up; their sons died in battles waged between kings; disease was rampant because most people lived in their own excrement.  Meaning that while perhalfs half of the king's children might survive to reproduce, for the peasants it was a small percentage. And who did the king's offspring have to marry?  So, yes, you have royal ancestors, because they were the ones who survived.|`|2xa4414maa	www.ancestry.com    It costs money, but it's an incredible resource for researching your family tree.|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	Start with you, then list everyone on your mother's side of the family, then list everyone on your father's side of the family.

0wKe8qYUaa	The main thing that you need to do is rehearse lots and always focus on your role, and make sure you know what your character is like, background etc...Also, you can make sure everything is smooth by making sure you have everything right...      Also, useful techniques like improvising while erhearsing are very useful as it gradually improves your performing skills...Don't be nervous about playing an important role, as it is like any other role too...Just focus hard on your role, and make suer you know your lines, lines and make sure your facial expressions are good, and make sure your voice is suitable to the type of character..    Hope this helps!    Anything else needed, feel free to contact me!|`|o50tkjFEaa	When you are playing the role you must forget about who you are for that time. Become the character.

VyE21Ybfaa	Sometimes you can have such an apprecition for watching a style of dance that when you go into to try it you have too many expectations of yourself. I honestly think you should try it. But try going to a community college beginners class. That way you aren't forced going too slow, but are in a class a people who aren't expecting perfection. Also be prepared to do your class warm-ups and exercises outside of class during the week too. This will help you advance more quickly, and give you more opportunity to practice and get comfortable without the pressure of feelig shy or embarrassed. If you enjoy your first semester keep going. My sister started at 16 and has some of the prettiest lines. So don't worry if you've started too late. Dancing takes practice no matter how long you've been doing it. And to me as long as you put your heart into what you're doing, it'll capture everyone's attention.|`|sKemuQyvaa	go ahead and try it! you will only gain from this experience, especially if you end up liking it. it sounds like you like ballet a lot already. i think you have a good chance of sticking with it.|`|AA12373921	There's nothing wrong with taking some classes. If you discuss it with your parents and let them know that this is something you want to *try* -- there should be no problem.    I started very late (in my late 'teens) and I'm not in a ballet company. But if a life as a dancer is your goal, that's one thing. You can always take classes just to feel better/improve yourself.    You'll probably also be exposed to Classical music, which is not a bad thing.    So think -- are you looking for a hobby? fun? or something more?     But 'til you try, you'll never know.  Go for it!

FaX8awk1aa	La Seu is a christian Cathedral located in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, was built on the site of an existing Arab mosque. The Cathedral is 121 metres long, 55 metres wide and 44 meters of nave height. The Cathedral, designed in spanish levantino Gothic or southern French Gothic style with influences of the north european gothic, was founded by King James I of Aragon in 1229 but finished only in 1601.    Fifty years after a restoration of the Cathedral had started, Antoni Gaud was invited in 1901 to take over the project. While some of his ideas were adopted - moving the choir stalls from the middle nave to be closer to the altar, as well as a large canopy - Gaud abandoned his work in 1914 after an argument with the contractor. The project was cancelled soon after.

cxDbdhELaa	Yes, it very likely does, unfortunately.  This is because to be truly philosophical leaves you with nothing to believe in.  All the old ways begin to seem...so childish.|`|FoIxsunVaa	I wouldn't know, I was bitter BEFORE I became philosophical. It certainly helps.|`|HORACAnlaa	No, it does not, fortunately. This is because to truly be philosophical one sees the grandness of the cosmos and beholds it in wonder. All the old ways begin to seem small, childish and meaningless. Meaning can only be found in the truthful.    Xenophon reported that Socrates was the happiest person he had ever known. Nietzsche sought to shout  "yes" and affirm life in every aspect of life. Two different philosophers thousands of years apart united in their love for philosophy and the joy it should bring.    To be bitter is to accept the emotional understanding of the old ways yet also accept, but only mentally, philosophy. It is the half way point between not being philosophical and being philosophical. To be truly philosophical one moves past bitterness to reconnect to wonder of childhood without the naivety of childhood.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Not at all.    It makes you look at things, not just pass them by.|`|N1ot1wpRaa	No not bitter but i have noticed that in thinking about things alot, sometimes i feel a bit overwhelmed and sometimes depressed.

Most of the time i am very glad that i think in this way, often it gives me motivation, ideas, and happiness|`|IaFTUQQGaa	No.  If a person is bitter and self absorbed they will tend to philosophies that reflect that.  If they are vibrant they will be drawn to more vibrant philosophies.    Each personality type can find a philosophy that makes them feel content and give them a world view to back up their intrinsic nature.    With a little bit of a nudge (intellectually speaking) you can look outside of you niche and find some that will open you up to a larger world view.    It is always just perspective.  No one is 100% correct in philosophy but it can be comforting.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	Interesting...     When I am feeling bitter or hurt, I tend to dwell more on philosophy.   Anyhow, it's just my personality to deal with theories and stuffs like that.|`|qUntsVD4aa	No!   Other way around maybe|`|Gtc161gRaa	It could if you let it.      be open minded.

AA11617206	Negativeness is created from others into your person. Maybe you care about too many people. When you care about too many people everything they do, everything they feel, everything they say affects you in one way or another. I used to care about so many people but now all that its dead. I now only care about 5 persons. My sister, my mother, my father, my girlfriend, and my best friend. This has helped me a lot. I know these people love me so negativeness its very little in my life. The problem with my strategy is that you let very little people into your life and the rest just bores you. That is the problem I am facing right now. But I think its better than being down most of the time. Remember that negative action comes from a positive one.|`|5963777c1326f25763b8e30c1e4286ffaa	Expect absolutely nothing.    You will have nothing to feel negative about, and everything will be positive..    (oh......... and don't watch comercials on tv).|`|AA11921320	When your life is drawing to a close and you look back at all you've done what is it that you'd like to feel proud about?  Those are the things we should strive to accomplish, whether they be smiling at strangers, making a million dollars, helping the needy or raising a great family.  What holds you back?  Many times it is fear.  We, as humans, seem to fear failure more than most other things so we don't take risks, we stay safe, we don't experience as much as we're able.  Were you raised in a religious upbringing?  Many religions teach guilt and teach us to feel bad about ourselves.  The original meaning of the word 'sin' is mistake or to miss the mark.  If we don't do well at something instead of feeling guilty, we should try again until we master the task and feel good about that.  Instead of spending a lot of time thinking about what holds you back, just decide what you want to do each day and do it.  Persevere and soon you'll find the limitations that held you back have been broken by simple determination and a desire to do more.  Best of luck to you!  You can do anything you set your mind to.

fcbb0737b31c8efc2a501292cca3019daa	First of all you're going to need to prepare your story in manuscript format. There are many, many websites where you can find out the details of how to format a manuscript page, but they're simply summed up:    a) One-inch margins all around, on either letter or A4 size plain white copier paper. NO onionskin or "corrasable" type paper.     b) Typed or printed double-spaced on ONE side of the paper in a good-sized clear type. (In black: no colors.)    c) Every page must have, at the top, your name, the name of the book, and the page number.    Then:     d) Using a current writer's market guide (check your local library), find out which publishers are publishing the kind of thing you're writing, and start submitting your book to them. At this stage in your career you do not need an agent. Submit the book to one of them at a time (multiple submissions are frowned upon). With the novel, each time, send out a cover letter briefly describing what your book's about, and thanking the editor for their time. Keep it dry and brief. Don't tell them it's the best book all your friends have ever read. Come to think of it, don't mention your friends at all, since every editor has read thousands of really awful submissions from people whose friends lied to them about how good their book was. (Sorry if the very thought is painful, but this is true.) Also, if you want your manuscript back, enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope bearing enough postage to bring the manuscript back from wherever you're sending it.    When an editor finally tells you they want to buy your book, start calling agents.You shouldn't have any trouble finding an agent at that point.  :)     Those are the basics, but there is much more that could be said. Again, there are tons of resources on the web for people interested in getting a children's book published.     Here are some pages you might look at:    http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/chil...    http://www.publishingcentral.com/article...    http://misssnark.blogspot.com/    Good luck!|`|AA12018289	Prepare a manuscript and find a literary agent.

Ser impulsivo para unos es un defecto y para otros no pero no lo considero grave.  Ser dominante puede ser un defecto y lo es si se lleva al extremo mximo(eso incluye machismo etc).  Ser intolerante es uno de los peores defectos para mi ya que conlleva la no aceptacin de la variedad(homosexuales,gays,otras razas y cosas por el estilo asi como no respetar opiniones ajenas).  La agresividad es un defecto pero tambin depende del grado en que la tengas.

It can be useful, but also disorienting and distorting.|`|AA11921320	Since it provides an added dimension to the experiences of senses I'd classify it as a gift before calling it a disease.  As with anything that only select experience, I imagine there is a nuisance factor connected.  The added depth of beauty and expression would seemingly override the distractions involved.

I1nLn1Qwaa	Great question Kat,  The Canadians like Australians, South Africans, Indians... yes Indians and New Zealanders were in it from the start.  The Americans held back to get all Britains oversees contracts.  They sold weapons and foodstuffs to Britain at grossly inflated prices which Britain had to pay for BEFORE the ships left the States... ya know... just in case they didn't make it.  Let them explain HOW the USA actually made a PROFIT from World War Two!  Many many British died as a result of helping others like Malta, Russia, Greece, Yugoslavia, France,Holland, Norway, Belgium, Spain and many more countries including Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, with arms agents and supplies.  This created resentment within the many countries who saw America as a big fat pig at the trough of inflated profits.. putting greed before compassion.  The American forces literally flooded the battlefields with men and equipment which Britain has Only recently finished paying them for... some friends huh?  On D Day, which troops had the greatest problems... yep... the Americans.  The real fighters had no time for the Americans who would get a medal if they cut themselves shaving: such was, and still is the worthlessness of most of their medals!  The only person to get a V C... a real medal respected throughout the world... of the many tens of thousands of troops on D Day, was an Englishman from my neck of the woods.  Stan Hollis.  Check it out!  As our boys were out fighting at the sharp end of the stick, the Americans muscled in with their sweet talk and goods which were impossible to get in Britain, creating floosies who would go with anyone for a pair of stockings, some cigarettes and a bar of chocolate.  Women then despised the "ladies" who had gone off with the Americans whilst their husbands were fighting Adolf.  Yes, it was great to get hard to get stuff, but when the chips were really down, when we really desperately needed help in 1939, 1940 and 1941, fighting alone in Europe and Africa where were our closest allies?  Probably putting another steak on the barbi, and supping a cool one on the porch.. nice!  The people themselves are fine if a little insuler... thanks to CNN and their ilk, but the American government is very inward looking, and knows how to screw their best mates through many decades of practise!  Please don't rope the Canadians in with the Americans, as they are fearless, loyal and bloody good people who don't make a crisis out of a simple situation, but get on with the job at hand without panic and hoo haa.  Good luck  Dream-Maker    http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/canadaw...  http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...      http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/dynamic...    empress xerxes...

God Bless them all!|`|EmgiGg17aa	Ask your mom or grandma or others who actually served in the war.|`|HXgeesBqaa	This pretty much covered the attitude at the time.    The Morgantown Post, 1958, in an article by Holmes Alexander:        "The British regarded us then as well-meaning but blundering intercessors whom they rather preferred to have on their island than the Jerries. We were, in the well-known phrase, 'overpaid, oversexed, and over here', and we were in British eyes over-decorated, overstaffed, over-maintenanced and overbearing."    American and Canadian G.I.s had access to food, nylons, candy and other items in short supply in war-ravaged Britain.|`|0jviPilhaa	They were 'Overpaid Over-Sexed and Over Here' was a typical phrase used. Generally I think that the women loved them for their ********* and charm. The men didn't like them for exactly the same reasons !!!|`|OmSJR5UFaa	Many British resented the Americans (and perhaps Canadians too) once they set up shop in England.  English girls found the young foreign troops to be a bit exotic if you will, and many British men became jealous of the youth and good looks of the Americans.    In fact, the resentful British coined the phrase "oversexed, overpaid, and over here" to describe the American troops.    Fact of the matter is, the American troops were a bit naive compared to their British counterparts.  The British had been on a war footing for much longer, and had already been accustomed to food rationing and the scarcity of goods.  The Americans showed up with seemingly everything that the British had not been able to obtain for awhile.    Most British, however, welcomed the American troops and extended much hospitality toward them.  Many friendships established between families then still exist to this day.|`|lrS8UXnYaa	Ridiculed|`|esrHWyRbaa	Canadians, I googled and found nothing they did in the World War.

YjvTQntAaa	For expressionism, it is not what you paint, but how you paint. People dancing can be illustrated within the rules of many different art styles. For expressionism, what matters is the tendency of an artist to distort reality for an emotional effect; it is a subjective art form. To make a painting of people dancing be expressionism, you must somehow paint the image in a not quite realistic way. How you do this depends on the emotions or message you want to send. You might try googling images of expressionist artwork. My source article below has several examples.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Use colors that exaggerate the emotions that you are trying to convey.  For anguish or grief use lots of blues and blacks. For excited passion use yellows and and reds.|`|Ds3G8yVxaa	I am not much of an artist but i think it's good. I have one idea though. The people could be different colors not usual colors is what i mean. there heads could be flat looking. one leg on one person. and to end it you can try to make it look like there is a banner behind them all but you cant quite read it like maybe your name or the school your in maybe even a motto that you like. anyone will work. well that's all i can think of.|`|urPVY8TNaa	Expressionism is a form of painting.  The content of the painting is not what defines wether or not it is expressionism, but the style of painting.    "Expressionism is the tendency of an artist to distort reality for an emotional effect; it is a subjective art form. Expressionism is exhibited in many art forms, including painting, literature, theatre, film, architecture and music. The term often implies emotional angst. In a general sense, painters such as Matthias Grnewald and El Greco can be called expressionist, though in practice, the term is applied mainly to 20th century works."  -Wikipedia|`|CP1E3Cataa	Expressionism is more about style than content.  Instead of trying to show how the subjects _look_, it focuses on how the artist, or the subjects, _feel_.  The point is to evoke these feelings in the viewer.      According to Wiki: "The basic characteristics of expressionism are Dionysian: bold colours, distorted forms-in-dissolution, two-dimensional, without perspective."  Munch's 'Scream' is the classic example, all the shapes melting and bending sickly to convey that sense of terror and make the viewer kind of uncomfortable.      So yes, you can paint an expressionist picture of dancers, but only if you think and focus on how dancing makes you feel, instead of how dancing looks.  Convey the feeling of dance (does it make you happy?  Sexually aroused?  Uncomfortable and self conscious?), not just the mechanics of dance.

I can tell you how to get into modeling and along the way you will learn how to pose in front of a camera, shooting with many different photographers while you learn and build you book (portfolio).  Once you get enough face time in front of the camera and have a good group of photos that show many of your different "looks", you can then start attending open calls hosted by advertising and modeling agencies as well as magazines.

SIzRlwBqaa	Are you referring to a specific poem?  If so, I see no link to the poem.    If you are asking about the general intention poets, then a general answer would be approperiate.   The word "poet" derives from the ancient Greek meaning "to create".  Poets intend to create and their creation is found in written words.  Poetry differs from prose.  Prose is factual and usually explains the what, why and where of a process, place or thing.  Poetry is written in many different forms...and is condensed in form.  Poetry is personal and has an emotional quality.  Poetry employs metaphor, simile-not always, but at times.    Post the poem you are asking about.

Life is not a roller coaster of love then some rock or pebble that has fallen from the sky of doom and dispair  This line just needs a different transistion word than 'then', because it doesn't really make sense how it is, alhtough I understand your point.

Dying in war in order to live in peace is noble.  Dying in war trying to save someone else is noble.  Living in peace isn't exactly noble unless you are the one choosing to live in peace.

Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,  Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,  A lonely impulse of delight  Drove to this tumult in the clouds;  I balanced all, brought all to mind,  The years to come seemed waste of breath,  A waste of breath the years behind  In balance with this life, this death.
C7mmYq6xaa	They're related, but not much, since my dad is about 50 years old and he has the shortest temper in humanity's story. Which caused him to "attack" me a few times when I didn't want to see his movies. A hardcore pain in the a**.  Some get angered easily because of very high blood pressure, I think my dad has that. Some, like me, get angered easily by irrationality because they're "sensitive" to insults and such. A very "irrational" friend of mine pissed me off today with destroying something I had made and then saying it was pathetic I had made something as stupid as that in a hour, making him look even more stupid. We got caught in a long fight and it ended up as irrational as him saying "People with OCD are just half-lives". If I hadn't thrown him out of my house before I was seriously pissed off I had beaten him silly.  I don't really know what kind of anger this is myself, I was completely stressed out after that, but.. I just don't see rationality in what he did...|`|eWPl2nL0aa	Maybe when one loses ones temper for no really good reason, one is acting immaturely, even if he or she usually acts in a very mature way. I do sometimes act less mature than at other times, and I see that in others too. And when people get very old, in what is sometimes called their "second childhood," they often get very irritable and lose their temper rather quickly. Hence, the legendary "grouchy" old man or woman.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Are you calling me immature?????    I resemble that remark!!!!|`|YmtNel5haa	I don't think so.  Some people have longer fuses than others.  I believe we all have our own personalities, and that contributes to how much it takes to set you off.|`|w6Lu2Oesaa	it is a trait that can be linked to other things. a short temper could mean you have high blood pressure or anger issues, etc...|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	With some people, yes.  There are temperaments with a short fuse.  It can be stress, too, or the hectic pace we are trying to live at.|`|hIaBgCrgaa	by what means do you measure "short temper"? and are you saying that they are intolerant of others? This question is not as easy to answer as you think because there are so many different circumstances that it is hard to lump everything together.    There is a difference between those who are justified in being angry and those that are irrational tyrants of propaganda. There is  difference you know.If you look at God he has been very patient with us and has watched the world and is waiting to deal with matters as he sees fit.    As 4 the question you already know the answer to it. Most of us do know much more than we would like to admit but that is part of the problem. Jesus is the light of the world and i feel one day not so far off it will get better for us.

They're frankly just ridiculous. And they don't even know it.|`|2ywzcoVqaa	They don't always go together. I'm a very mature person but there are times I get angry quickly,especially when someone says something bad about my kids,parents or grandchildren. Then I'm ready to kill. lol|`|pQGUPITeaa	They can't always be linked, because I don't get angry quickly, yet I'm very immature.    Maybe I'm too immature and ignorant to know what's important enough to get angry about?

qlgti3wKaa	This is very good, I must say. When you think about it, it's just two teens passing notes, but it really does leave you wanting to know what the boy is going to say to her. Interesting.     I did come across a couple of minor mistakes. First, dialogue. You're doing it a bit wrong. "Impatience becomes you." he said with a laugh. This is incorrect. The correct way is to place a comma in place of the period. "Impatience becomes you," he said with a laugh. This happened twice.    Also, some of your sentence structure is...strange. "Glancing down at the note, I didnt know which was more embarrassing. My pulsing heart or my smarting face." This should be one sentence, not two. I saw this a few times throughout this.    Overall, great job. It definitely leaves the reader wanting more, which is a hard, but very valuable trait to have as a writer. :)|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Use spell-check and grammar-check. Learn how to use proper punctuation. Learn how to write dialogue.     There is far too much "telling" and nearly no "showing."    Proofread your stuff. Read it out loud.

When I say everything i mean everything. Think about the implications of that. All the surveillance in the world for what? God has seen it all and that's his job.

In the movie "Defending Your Life" with Albert Brooks his life is played back b4 him and he has to answer for his decisions. Much like a court case but on the highest level.

Privacy is just a privilege adults grant each other. Parents of under 18 year olds have an OBLIGATION to snoop.    if a parent can be criminally negligent for not stopping their child from commiting a crime, they would be PROSECUTABLE for not keeping tabs on their teenagers.
a1Ngi39Xaa	I kinda think it's wrong.      Violation:  Well, I guess it's the right of having whatever you want in your own personal space, without having to justify or explain it to someone.  My bedroom is my mecca.  I write poetry there.  I also keep a journal.  Sometimes I write when I am extremely mad or depressed.

It is wrong, unless it is a parent.  If the parent suspects drug use, then it is  justifiable.  Otherwise it's probably  not wise. But parents do have a right to know what is going on in a teen's life.|`|FCgF4G7Raa	Someone would have to make a lot of assumptions to give a detailed answer to this question.  Do you own the room, or was it issued to you by the owner?  What relationship exists between you and the snoop?  If there is one of authority, the snoop could be legitimate (such as the FBI searching an alledged criminal's house, or a principal searching a student's locker).    Since it is the training of those in the practice of law to consider these and similar questions, the omission of such information by one claiming such knowledge could suggest an intention to mislead potential respondents, possibly invalidating the responses.|`|N1ot1wpRaa	The word "snoops" says it all. If you didn't want them to go in your room, then i would argue that, that is wrong.    I am not clear of rights, although i would imagine it depends on the owner of the house.   If you live with parents for example and they own the house then it would be in their right to enter your room.    However, if you live in shared rented accommodation, you should have a lock on your door and you could probably prevent them from entering your room by locking the door. If they persisted to enter your room by some other means then i am sure you are in your right to stop this by law.  Your landlord has the right to your room but in the Uk he/she MUST give 24hrs notice before entering your room|`|2f1IEC1Qaa	yes if it's not a spouse or person in a personal relationship beyond just being a person who pays some rent, if it is just cohabitation of space for rent sharing then it is encroachment on private space, your bedroom is private space, and snooping in same is tantamount to breaking and entering.  Living room,   kitchen,   toilets dining area all public space.   bedrooms and closets in bed rooms private.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Wrong, no, but most people ARE sensitive about their privacy. What is funny is that I am NOT that way but I wouldn't dream of prying into other people's business. My co-worker is an inveterate snoop and is paranoid of someone looking at her stuff.
AE2iQVKRaa	I think he was a great strategist, but was more a politician than a general. He left his troops when they needed him the most, because of his political ambitions. He left his troops in Egypt, when his fleet had been annihilated by the British in Abukir and the siege of Acre had failed, because he saw a chance to depose the directory.  He abandoned his troops in Russia after being defeated by the Russian winter, for fear of a coup d'tat.   His victories were at least partly due to the sheer number of his soldiers. In total, almost 3 million soldiers fought for France, far outnumbering the other nations.        I think it is difficult to rank armies dating to completely different time frames with completely different armament and opponents. The value of an army depends on its armament and the strategy of its general.   I think every army you mention had elements that played in their advantage.  Napoleon had the sheer number of his troops, and had a technological advantage on the Egyptian Mameluks.  The British Imperial army mainly fought armies with weaponry that was technically less advanced than theirs.   The same can be said of the Mongolian army of Genghis Khan, whose bows had a longer range than those of their opponents.   Alexander had the heavy armor of the pezhetairoi in his phalanx, opposed to the mostly lightly armored Persian troops.   At the start of the war, Hitler's tanks had better armor than the ones produced by the allies.  It takes a great general and/or very special geographical and meteorological conditions to overcome technological disadvantages, e.g. the Russian steppes and winter and the Afghan mountains.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	General?

5zQbG8TDaa	Greenfield, Eloise (b. 1929), author of prize-winning children's books. Eloise Greenfield was born 17 May 1929, the second oldest of five children, in Parmele, North Carolina, during the early days of the Great Depression. Though money was scarce, Green-field has fond memories of how family and neighbors made her childhood enjoyable. Influenced by her personal childhood memories and experiences, by observations, and by other stories she has read and heard about, Greenfield has created lively, humorous, rhythmic books and stories that are deeply rooted in reality. Her stories are for children ranging in age from prekindergarten to junior high school. One of her books, Honey I Love (1978), which is a collection of love poems, crosses age groups and is enjoyed by kindergartners, teens, and adults. In her stories, Greenfield tries to create what she describes as word madness, or that feeling of excitement that one gets when reading (interview by Jean Ross in Contemporary Authors, 1987). To attain this word madness Greenfield explains that she tries to choose and order words that children will celebrate. She wants children to celebrate such issues as family solidarity, relationships, Black heritage, and the joys and turmoils of everyday life.|`|pRqBB2xPaa	I do know she wrote poetry.

qt4UzxBdaa	I have had some crazy things happen to me, so I don't feel, just know.    But I'm a very strong believer in that idea the everything happens for a reason but we have to create that reason and figure out what you're suppose to do when the things that are suppose to happen happen.    Like if someone dropped out of a class, a class that would change your whole life, you'd have to put forth the effort to take that class you won't just be put in it.    Horrible example, I just think life sets things up to happen certain ways; we are given unlimited amounts of paths that are there and are laid out, or "happen" to be created, for a reason. We just have to take the initiative.|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	Some things are and some things are not. A lot of coincidence happens in life.

But I have to add a bit onto the random part.

Sometimes you don't know why for a very very long time, and sometimes never find out.  I've had too many realizations of why things have happened in my life to not believe it's true that there was a reason for the events.  I think, though, that technically you do find out, because I believe that when one dies, they come to realize and know everything they didn't while they were alive.  All questions are answered in death.|`|cm7QojiIaa	Watch the movie Serendipity.  That basically answers the question for me.
qRx3ynKdaa	The account by which Arthur gained the Round Table through his marriage to Guenevere is first mentioned in a romance generally called the Perlesevaus.     In this story, Kay treacherously murders Lohot, the son of Arthur and Guenevere. Guenevere dies of sorrow. Thereupon her kinfolk demand that the table be returned to them. The idea would seem to be that since Guenevere is dead with any heirs to carry on her line, her dowry should be returned to the family. For this story see, http://omacl.org/Graal/, particularly branch 21 and following which introduces the motif of Guenevere's death.    In other versions, however, the Round Table has a different origin.    It was created after a quarrel in Arthur's hall by a wise man for Arthur in Layamons Brut: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14305.    The table was created by Merlin for Arthurs father Uther Pendragon according to Robert de Borons Merlin". See a later Middle English translation at http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/tex... chapter III. Or for a modern English translation of a medieval Spanish adaptation, see http://members.terracom.net/~dorothea/ba... chapters 1415.    In the Prose Lancelot there is a reference to Arthur going to the Kingdom of King Leodagan disguised as a squire and winning Guenevere's hand, but the full story is not told anywhere. But here also the Round Table is Arthurs only through his wife, it having been given to him along with her hand in marriage.    Two sequels to Robert de Borons Merlin were written to provide an early history of Arthur.    According to one, sometimes called the Vulgate Merlin, after King Uther Pendragons death, the Knights of the Round Table had taken service under King Leodagan because of the evil that had arisen in Logres, presumably a reference to the dispute over who should become king after Uther. Arthur goes to Leodgan's kingdom annonymously with 41 companions and take service under King Leodagan, who is being warred upon by King Rion. The troop saves Leodagans life and their leader, Arthur, is greatly esteemed by Guenevere. Accordingly he accepts his bid to become Gueneveres husband. Then Arthur reveals who he is and King Leodagan promises him the Kinghts of the Round Table for his dowry. See chapters XIV and XX in the middle English version I have already spoken about.    The other version is often called the Post-Vulgate Merlin. In this account Arthur tells Merlin he wants Guenevere as a wife, Guenevere who is daughter of King Leodagan who holds in his house the Round Table that Merlin and Uther Pendragon had founded. Genevere has never been mentioned before. Merlin goes with an escort of 100 knights and arranges anything. King Leodagan is very pleased and says that Arthur needs no more land, but the will bestow on him the Round Table.    Malorys version comes from an account close to the Cambridge version of the Post-Vulgate Merlin, which also includes some material from the Vulgate Merlin, including a very abridged account of how Arthur helped Leodagan against King Rion.    The idea is that a daughter ought to inherit also, but that since a woman cannot hold property normally while her husband lives, her inheritance is given into her husbands keeping, as she herself is. This inheritance is the Round Table, though after King Leodagans death, his entire kingdom was also given into Arthur's hands.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Le Morte Darthur - Sir Thomas Malory    Study Guides:    http://www.arthurian-legend.com/le-mort-...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...

MoidAgwuaa	I think that almost all altruistic acts benefit the "doer" as well. It gives a person a sense of doing good, which raises self esteem and standing amongst others. That's not a bad thing -- far fewer nice things would be done for people if there wasn't some kind of intrinsic reward.    The only pure altruistic act is to give your life for someone. You can't reap the reward of their thanks and all the good feelings if you're dead.     Unless you believe you'll be rewarded in the afterlife, and then, who knows? If you gave your life for someone mostly because you wanted to be rewarded, would you even go to Heaven? That's a pretty selfish way to get a ticket to the pearly gates, even if you did sacrifice yourself.|`|VPptQSBHaa	I think so.  If you truly love/care for someone, you want to do anything for them.  However, some will get really technical and argue that you can be "selfish" in doing this because you love them and that means something to YOU as a person, as you "need" them.    I guess it all depends on what your views are on love and if that counts as "selfish" or not.     In my opinion, love is selfless and there is such things as a truly altruistic act.|`|nhGorPBoaa	I think that to consider what it would look like for there to be an altruistic action would benefit all parties interested in the answer.  I do not think that an altruistic action must lack all benefit to the doer, rather i think that even if there is a benefit being gained, that benefit is simply not the cause or the reason that the doer decides to act.   For example, when i get my wife a cup of water of course there will be benefits for me in that action, but am i doing it for those benefits? I think that a person can achieve a position in life where he can act for higher purposes than self benefit. Is it often achieved? Hard to say. Can i identify at least once in my own life where the cause of an action was not the benefit i would receive? I would like to say yes.   P.S. I do not think that you have to go so far as to die for your friend in order to achieve an altruistic act (as is clear from my above explanation)  :)|`|AA11503678	I believe the most virtious act is to give things when you need them, to help when you need help. This cannot be done just to feel good about oneself.    If it is to be known and for fame among other people it is not a completely perfect altruism imo. Intention is key. For sake of Creator.    Imagine that you are fighting for protecting your homeland, then you are nearly dead, you are thirsty, when some fellow gives you the last cup of water, you hear another one is dying and wants water, then you choose not to drink it, you say "give the water to him" and you die. Can this be selfish or in other words isn't it perfect altruism?    If you have ever wondered how come there are billions of Muslims, how did they become most powerful civlization in past for hundreds of years? This is because of the first Muslims' altruism like this one.    They gave their last food to visitors. Last chance to drink water while thirsty and dying was the thing they sacrificed.    With Respect|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	"Is there such a thing as a truly altruistic act?" Maybe not.  But I suppose it's possible that someone does something out of a sense that it is right or good to do and isn't looking for any reward.  I don't think Darwin has anything to do with it.  For instance, if someone does something because she thinks God will approve, is that really necessary for survival?|`|FCgF4G7Raa	"Greater love has no man than that he lays down his life for his friend." --Jesus    It's hard to find a selfish motive in that.

I think you could also bring into this how the Soviet Union expanded.  Germany/Berlin were divided and how this impacted people living there and for how long.  Six million Jews alone were killed in the Holocaust, this doesn't include Gypsies, people with mental disabilities, and other "undesirables".  More women entered the workforce to help build the airplanes and necessary equipment.  You have the Marshall plan which comes about in an effort to rebuild Europe.  I think you could explain several of these aspects or focus on one. Good luck! It sounds like an interesting project.

VPptQSBHaa	I believe so.    The devil is for things that are wrong, and love is good.|`|ghMJyzsOaa	The devil is a representational myth used to encapsulate anything that interrupts the natural stream of desire to accomplish our dreams. In religion God is saddled with a consummate personality, but a God that is being presented as perfect would surely not be responsible for the atrocities and natural disasters. It would be inconceivable to think a perfect God would allow such things to happen. Therefore man manufactured a concept that would solve this problem by introducing a hellish realm where the devil has control. This is now disseminated by those who follow a pious brand of religion that the devil is Gods opposite causing havoc in this earthly realm.     I believe the only thing fighting against love is our self-induced ignorance, surrounding our ability to understand the mental and emotional nature of our deisign. If we truly knew the far reaching consequences, pertaining to our choices of action, we would, I'm sure, pay much more attention to choosing perceptions, that are more in alignment with the potential to establish the fruitful qualities of love.    I personally follow the divine spirit that has been placed within me and I do also acknowledge that their is a supra divine source from where all this life has come from. I do respect all beliefs whether religious or not. These are just my personal views. Bless you|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	Yes, and the fallen aspect of human nature.  We're here to learn to love, and there are challenges.  But here is also grace.|`|3H8jvC2aaa	If you believe in free will and you are a loving person, how can this entity you call the devil touch you?    Love is only limited by the limits we place on it.  We are all tested in good ways and bad, but our choices determine our actions.  Those that blame a devil for bad things that happen or their own bad behavior needs to look in the mirror and see that we, not any outside force, are running the show.    If you don't have the love you want, ask yourself what you are doing to repel love.  Some people have low self-esteem and drive people away with being needy or self-deprecating.  That is a turn off.  Some people keep testing a potential mate to see if they will leave.  There are many way to chase love away.  No devil plays into it.  There is no evil that can out shine true love.|`|yAXrsQiFaa	No.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	The devil and human nature|`|Z2n0qi2naa	human nature. natural forces we cant control because we dont understand them, or we dont want to understand them. no devil is involved though lol.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Yes there is something fighting against romantic love, it's called COMMON SENSE.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Hate is the opposite of Love  Good=God  Devil=evil  All that is negative is of the adversary.  All that is positive is of God.  :D|`|UtzALxfjaa	Well, yes. The devil is against love and humans seeking someone to call them their soul mate. Afterall, the devil despises to see us happy.|`|AA12079397	The acquaintance of bad people causes this trouble. Some people are suffering because of this evil since childhood. Big people suffers more in this case. Devils are always greedy of dominating everything in this world. If a devil is in line then there will be obstacles. We must keep our life's situation clean and acquaintance with clean (mind) people.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, the devil is full of hate and vengeance.  He wants to get God back for throwing him out of heaven and sentencing him to hell so he's doing everything to hurt us and trying to do anything possible to get us to give up trusting the Lord so we'll lose our salvations and go to hell with him forever.|`|eb38abe11698b46fde324034db87a709aa	Yes, my own need for security.|`|N0ed8LCwaa	the opposite of love is ego.    you always have the choice of taking the wide, bendy road of ego or the straight, narrow path of love.     love is when you think of others first, ego is when you only think of yourself.    love leads to growth, ego to destruction.|`|5RbXr7Wjaa	No. I'm agnostic and for me the most agreeable religon is Deism (God created the Earth and allowed the laws of nature to govern it rather than Himself). I strongly question the presence of divine forces acting in any way.

Very nice   *star*|`|593f19e142e7cb17d4d692bb10721fc9aa	I like it, its personal and has repition which ties it pretty nicely.  I can tell you are taking it from something you have felt. Well done. Just so you know i am a young poet as well.|`|xxNAq3S1aa	I like it "sorrow turns to rage" its so true! i want to find a way to rephrase that so I can put that into one of my poems|`|7WgGfObkaa	That was very well written.  Did you come up with the style on your own, or have you seen it before?  I think it has potential, but I've never been a fan of sad or angry poems.  The subject is the only thing that bothers me.  I really liked the way you led into the "stop, stop, stop" part.  You also did it with the word "lies".  I think it would have been more effective if you had done it a third time, simply because the human mind loves the  3.  Very well done, I'll have to look out for more of your posts.|`|3riwe1Seaa	I liked it a lot.  I loved how you used one word to end and start another phrase.  I liked how it kind of went into a circle, emphasizing the 'cycle'.|`|6pKFAO0kaa	Very nice. I can feel the emotion in this poem very strongly. It's easily related to and has a great meaning.|`|4rn3cGy0aa	this is so amazing :)  i like the part about "stop this cycle."|`|PKZBx7QAaa	I thought it was fairly good, Except it was kind of hard to understand what the poem was about, while reading it because all the attention i thought was on the words that were back to back. It was pretty draining for me to read because of that, but that's my personal opinion, I like pretty simple writing. but it was good, and I like how you kind of mixed it up a bit, I've never read a poem like this.|`|NaENZSJRaa	wow thats deep|`|871f96b408c518577f7be3cd5e409361aa	Yeah1 A meaningful experiment.
XBV6DP84aa	Breaking Dawn really was so anticlimactic, wasn't it?  I was like "Fiiiiinalllly, some action! Wahey, a fight! Oh...no...wait. They're talking it out... of course they are." *burns book*  If she sacrificed some characters, maybe. I don't mean a full on massacre, but I think it would be good for the book.  Oh, and I loved how she all of a sudden "Fell out of 'love'" With Jacob. I think it would have been so much more interesting if she still loved him. There's a following book I would read.|`|NeOwDBulaa	I totally agree. Meyer got too attached to her cardboard characters and wanted a happy ending. Someone should have died, seriously.|`|Aj16de8Aaa	I loved the ending. I would have been depressed if anybody else had died. especially Emmet. I was a great ending. I loved it.|`|6HOcthxaaa	yea i think they should have fought too..and other boy. i forget his name who is like renesme..well its very ironic..cuz i think it would be better is renesme was one of a kind.|`|sPScyaF6aa	I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING!!!!  NOTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!!!!  IM GLAD NO ON DIED!!!!  AND EDWARD GOT TO READ BELLAS THOUGHTS FOR LIKE A SECOND!!!!   THAT WAS WICKED AWESOME!!!!  I LOVE TWILIGHT!!!!  TEAM EDWARD FOREVER!!!!|`|SYKGIiQkaa	No one would have said 'fervently' in that situation. The book was terrible, and it really didn't have to be. It would have been far better if some of the characters actually died so the ending would have some sort of meaning.|`|VskHXw7kaa	I thought that was awesome.|`|d8b6703f3fe553c8173f1543b80dcc85aa	Well, I see where you are coming from and it was a little bit of a disappointment but then again, reading about wars i soooo boring.  and i think that Edward and Bella are supposed to have a happy ending.  And i think that Bella should have only been able to use her power on vampires and humans.    so the werewolves can have their fun.|`|VQ5gX1m0aa	FIRST OF ALL BREAKING DAWN IS THE BEST BOOK EVER  SECOND NOTHING EDWARD SAYS IS STUPIED  THIRD ALICE IS NOT RUINING THE ENDING AT LEAST SHE CAME BACK|`|OoEmIzcvaa	To be quite honest, I think the whole series is stupid... Everyone should of died, which then clears up all the bloody holes in the book. End of story. Everyone died.|`|USoCUVeOaa	Any other story in her books unrelated to her love story seems to be something she hurries through just to add a backdrop, which is utterly a shame.  She brings up so many cool ideas for her supernatural world that I almost feel cheated that she didn't spend time on them.  Vladimir is obviously Dracula but she doesn't go into much there.  She mentions the "Children of the Moon" who are apparently real werewolves instead of shape shifters like the indian tribes would have been nice to find out more about them.  However she only really cares about the love story that I only halfheartedly cared about.  So over all yeah it is something of a letdown and it seems like she took an easy way out just to finish the book and earn that paycheck.
FE4B8uynaa	Well my Favorites are these in this order. Zoey Redbird, Stevie Rea, Aphrodite,Damien, Jack, Erik, Heath, Stark, and the Twins.   I think someone might get super hurt and i don't think Kenola will be put to rest in the book. I think the group is going to get the Tribe sisters together and build another model out of clay and send her away and maybe the book will end like that or something but I am registered to thehouseofnight.com and they sent me the first chapter to Hunted. It was soo good. I think stark and zoey will become closer and he will be fixed too and Erik and zoey i have no idea.     Here read the first chap the sent to my email if you already havent.http://media.hbpub.com/stmartins/houseof...|`|UIILEn0Uaa	oh, I love those books!    Okay, I can't remeber his name.. but he was Zoey's 'real' boyfriend (not the teacher, and not the human(heath)  I can't seem to remeber his name though!!    I think that Zoey and (my fav character, her real boyfriend)  will get back together.  I think Zoey will become a vampire  and I think someone will die (i just havent decided who yet)    Hunted comes out like in March, right?  I cant wait!|`|tR36oILvaa	Oh i love those books they are just so addictive. I haven't read all of them because they are not all out over here (to my knowledge) but i have read marked    my favorite character is Stevie Rea (i think here name is...the cowgirl-y one) because of the cowgirliness|`|05oSazHlaa	omg ok so heath is goin to end up in the tunnels   and zoey is goin to sleep with erik   and the nun is goin to be bad   stevie ray is goin to be bad   zoey is goin to have a new boyfriend|`|AGaQ4lpiaa	Its so good to finaly find peoples ideas on hunted    That you for the link for the first chapter  zoey real boyfriend is erik  i LOVE erik, he is my favourite, i also like the new gay one, i forget has name     i think the story will be the same as some people have mention  I hope erik sleeps with zoey again :)    OMG love the books|`|ugiUyhOwaa	I love that series!    My favorite character, aside Zoey, would be Aphrodite and Grandma Redbird. I like Aphrodite because of the sneaky friendship she built with Zoey. I found it funny whenever they say they hate each other but they are winking. I like Grandma Redbird because she really loves Z very much as if she is her real daughter.     I thik what would happen in Hunted is Z and the gang will find a way to fight Kalona. I hope Grandma Redbird will soon recover too. But I know one thing's for sure - Z will get new tattoos.    P.S.  Have you read the 1st Chapter of Hunted? I think it's already posted on the http://www.houseofnightseries.com/ .But to be sure, just sign up for the subscription to receive the chapter one.
AA12016117	It was just a pose, adopted by many sitters and painters of the time.  It was a pose of the gentleman.    http://www.napoleonic-literature.com/Fac...    "The 'hand-in' portrait type appeared with "relentless frequency" during the eighteenth century and became almost a cliched pose in portrait painting. The pose was used so often by portraitists that one was even accused of not knowing how to paint hands. "In real life," Miller observes, "the 'hand-held-in' was a common stance for men of breeding.""  From "Re-Dressing Classical Statuary: The Eighteenth-Century 'Hand-in-Waistcoat' Portrait." by Arline Miller.|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	I believe if you research it you will find the his hand was injured or deformed|`|OmSJR5UFaa	Because he had gas, and the pain was constant.  He needed to massage his abdomen to find relief.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	There are several theories, but the one that most agree on is that he had stomach cancer preceded by other stomach problems and he had to constantly comfort this area. So he was painted with his hand inside his jacket because he was most often seen in this position.|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	He wasn't always painted this way, but he liked this pose.  It seemed statesman-like, somber, and authoritative.

Keep it up, You can rhyme everyword perfectly. Its beautiful and very touching!|`|AA10452263	The rhyming scheme could use some serious work. This reads more like rap than poetry. I get the feeling that you compromised your point a time or two just to find a rhyme or to use whatever rhyme had occurred to you. There at the end you lost the repetitive rhyming scheme a bit, and while I'm sure that it bugs you that the lines toward the end don't exactly rhyme, the last portion of the poem is the best part. The rhyming isn't that important. It isn't really what makes poetry.  I can tell that you really racked your brain trying to finish the poem and you did well. The content is a fine example of the emotional turmoil of adolescence.|`|XfXRFCtcaa	wow.       that's pretty good
DChJd7Nsaa	keen intellect of god!|`|YmtNel5haa	isn't this the same question as the one that is like two questions down?  Liars lie about anything they want to.|`|Poo5RULPaa	There is no such person as a "liar". No one can consistently and consecutively spew lies at every turn.    If you mean: "Do people lie, and say they understand philosophy?", then sure, a lot of people would say they understand philosophy after they hear someone using principles once or twice.|`|PnkVepW2aa	Liars, lol. we're all liars, at times even the best of us and if you say your not then you are most certainly lying. so i've never met a liar so i wouldn't know.|`|mmnkMU5paa	In order to be a liar, you have to say the exact opposite of what you actually think, or know, to be true.  So for anyone to lie about understanding philosophy, they would have to say, "Yes, I understand philosophy.", while at the same time thinking or knowing that, "No.  I do not understand philosophy."    However, there are a lot of people who think they understand philosophy and say they do, but don't.  So they are simply mistaken, rather than liars.  Socrates ran into a lot of such people in ancient Athens.    They thought they knew things that they did not know and Socrates proved it to them.  Some people became angry that their supposed wisdom always ended in self contradictions.  Others thought Socrates actually knew what he professed to not know.  Both kinds of people either (1) positively hated or were (2) indifferent to Socrates's pursuit of wisdom.    But still others began to try to answer the questions which Socrates's dialogue partners could not answer, and, thereby became great philosophers, like Plato and Aristotle.|`|kHfRz5Wiaa	I feel they UNDER stand philosophy UPNTIL they grow up!|`|TAW380vMaa	they cannot get their own thing to do,., i wonder what employment spreads about ideas though!
oK9WhUkiaa	i studied photography for 3 years and i found the most impressive photos were black and white ones. they give out alot of emotion. animal photos are always nice so maybe u could take a pic of ur dog and turn it into a black and white pic...this type of photo would look good... http://fc91.deviantart.com/fs11/i/2006/1...  landscape photos can look nice but u have to choose somewhere that has alot of character and shape, a plain field would look abit dull so somewhere like a lake would nice... http://fc22.deviantart.com/fs11/i/2006/2... or even a graveyard, it sounds strange and morbid but graveyards (especially in black and white) make amazing atmospheric photos... http://fc08.deviantart.com/fs8/i/2005/32...  =] x|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Let your conscience be your guide. Landscapes, outdoors or something of "human interest" usually gets the attention of most judges. Be willing to travel to look for something interesting.|`|Es56v2Ohaa	Breath-taking scenery is always a super plus, but if you're looking for something different, try something intresting in your neighborhood.    perhaps you can people spy.  lol  snap random pictures along with carefully taken ones, random pics tend to come out really nice.|`|tsoc9tihaa	i take photos of motorways at night  get someone to drive down  sit in the passengers seat  and take a photo using a slow shutter speed so all the lights run.  make sure you dont use a flash though  you dazzle drivers.  but it does turn out well :)|`|1NK1hK1Taa	One of my best pics was of some trees outlined by the red sky of a sunset. It looked good, though i say so myself.   Whatever you decide to photograph, try to frame it well. If you are using a digital camera, go out and click on lots of different things. If you are out in the woods, is there an interestingly shaped tree, or log? Some fungi on a tree, toadstools? If you have the light and a longer lens, maybe keeping quiet and trying to shoot some wildlife. If you go out with your camera with taking pictures in mind, you will be surprised what looks good.   A large farm house at the far end of a ploughed field, with all the furrows pointing towards the building. Honestly, in the right frame of mind you'll soon find your memory card is full.  Happy snapping:)|`|GznItj4saa	Abandoned buildings and especially factories or dairy farms. However, that's just my interest. Does the competition have a theme?

g8kIjpwSaa	This is a really cool photo. My only suggestion is that you might have done better by positioning yourself right at the median of the highway. The cropping of the pattern on the chain link fence is almost perfectly centered and symmetrical, but the orientation of the roads throws off that symmetry.|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	This I like very much. The image screams alienation - the chain links seperating the viewer from the fast passage of life, backwards and forwards, good or bad, the viewer can only watch and not participate. This is the first photograph I have seen on this site that actually sems to mean something. Whether that is your intention or not, you have captured something profound. Well done.|`|sBVyjEs5aa	very nice!  i like it a lot, actually.  i don't really have anything to say that could make it better, I think if you tweak it anymore it would ruin it. Maybe just making the fence a LITLLE darker, to create more contrast. but superb!|`|q16iJ6PSaa	Ooooooh! I like it! Cool colors, nice point of view, nice long shutter! LOVE it!|`|yT295TT2aa	wow you are great when i beautiful things my eyes water up|`|AA10006331	I would also have centered it and used a remote flash with perhaps a colored flash diffuser.

JIwKRZADaa	Utilitarian ethics= The action that recieves the most benefit with the least amount of damage is the moral action    -Advantages: Sort of self explanatory, it produces the most benefit    -Disadvantages: Can be used to justify slavery if it benefits the whole, can treat people as numbers    Kantian Categorical Imperative= An action is moral only if the same action can be used in every circumstance and the world can still function.    -Advantages: Morality is seen as something that allows the group to function as a whole, making one accountable to all.    -Disadvantages: there are exploits of the categorical imperative. If a person were to steal, under the cat. imp. the action would be moral. If everyone were to steal, there would be no personal property, making stealing obsolete. Everyone's property is everyone elses. Stealing is moral.    This question could actually pose a conflict between the two theories.    Utilitarianism would say that i should answer the question because answering it would produce the most benefit to me. I can get 2-10 points, instead of 0 for not answering the question.    Categorical imperative would say that if i always answered your homework questions they you would not learn anything.|`|YmtNel5haa	I was so excited to see this question.

KH3kbRjgaa	The poem uses theater metaphors throughout to deal with human life on a universal level. An audience of weeping angels watches a seemingly mad play performed by "mimes, in the form of God on high," and controlled by vast formless shapes looming behind the scenes. Finally, a monstrous "crawling shape" emerges, and eats the mimes. The final curtain comes down, "a funeral pall," signaling an end to the "tragedy, 'Man'" whose only hero is "The Conqueror Worm." The poem seems to imply that human life is mad folly ending in hideous death, the universe is controlled by dark forces man cannot understand, and the only supernatural forces that might help are powerless spectators who can only affirm the tragedy of the scene. ?|`|1Z5f82lqaa	The poem is about the inevitable death, how we will die and end up being a meal for the worms ... even if angels come to our rescue.

S4W7FojCaa	This is from her website (I just copy and paste):    I woke up (on that June 2nd) from a very vivid dream. In my dream, two people were having an intense conversation in a meadow in the woods. One of these people was just your average girl. The other person was fantastically beautiful, sparkly, and a vampire. They were discussing the difficulties inherent in the facts that A) they were falling in love with each other while B) the vampire was particularly attracted to the scent of her blood, and was having a difficult time restraining himself from killing her immediately. For what is essentially a transcript of my dream, please see Chapter 13 ("Confessions") of the book.      Here is the website: http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight.h...    And yes, I do believe vampires exist. And yes I think it's possible that they can be like Edward, but I don't believe a real vampire can go out in the sun or be satisfied with animal blood.|`|3cWnasQ2aa	i guessing yes for the first part... i believe vampires exist but not really like Edward... vampires to me suck the energy from humans souls... they are more prone to conflict than Vampyres who are the ones that suck blood... i dont believe they are evil either (none of them) they are beautiful, but they can sleep and eat (they dont have to sleep or eat for up to a month though) they also do not have to kill their victums (while sucking a humans blood (or half human) they learn everything about that person (that helps them to choose whether to kill them, let them live, or change them)   you also can not be changed into a full vampyre you have to be born into it|`|g1AtI2t2aa	she had a dream of the two main characters(bella and edward) and began to write about it and made a book. i think vampires do exist 'cause the Tyra Show they had vampires who are actually real people but they drink blood and stuff like that. they weren't born vampires or have a vampire family like the cullens and they don't sleep in coffins like the myths. so yeah they're just regular ppl with an extraordinary sense of smell and drink human blood.

If you need a break, for instance, you can ask for a delay until the next one. Etiquette does not, however, allow you to decline simply because a boy is not one you like. And if you decline a dance, you certainly can't accept a "better offer" for the same dance.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	Don't be rude or embarrassing about it.

MPtt9wPjaa	free-will.. the ability to make your own choices right?  well.. God has given us intellect, that's what separates us from animals. The ability to intellectually understand and act. When you say a song you listen to is sort of a reflection of your experiences, werent those experiences the result of your choices? no matter what happens to you, it happens BECAUSE of you.. "az mast ki barmast"(a line from a Farsi poem).  so yea.. i would say more like.. were given intellect.. free-will has never been one of my preferred choice of words.  and we are therefore, NOT limited beings. maybe for materialistic things.. things that dont matter.. things which in your words are "us being brainwashed by this worlds fake and shitty values and morals" things like flying or something. useless things.  i dont know if that makes sense.. its one of those topics where i have so many thoughts its hard to put into words. but i hope you get it :)  p.s. it's wonderful that you wonder :)|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	See the work of Benjamin Libet|`|59fZ25iDaa	How can you become perfect? Jesus said be perfect as you father in heaven is perfect. You heard it said nobody is perfect and in the realm of human existence that is true. But it is not the attainment of perfection it is the journey.The force that powers that journey is free will. You have been given the gift of choice and  the choices you choose will mold who you are.  Do not confuse choice with wreck less abandon. Seek truth as a direction in your l    It will take one or more lifetimes to really sink in.|`|5ohGgBkZaa	i dont think you can tell, because there's no way you can tell if everything is a precise calculation, or a meaningless, functionless...blob i guess. who knows if everything thats every happened has happened by a certain calculation or by mere chance? So to answer your question; I dont know, and neither does anybody else. Thats the cruelty of curiosity and thought.|`|mmnkMU5paa	QUESTIONNER:  I think (of) the idea of free-will & have given it a lot of thought- I think that it doesn't really exist ...i want you to help me understand otherwise if true.  Here's what i think: We are limited beings who live according to limited conditions...    ANSWERER:  How does being limited preclude the idea of "free will"?  Granted that we are limited.    QUESTIONNER:  Every choice that you believe that you are freely taking is just an illusion that you want your mind to believe. The fact that you decide to listen to this romantic song & not a rock song is because of events & past & current experiences that make your present mood the way it is now which leads you to listen to a romantic song...you do not choose to....    ANSWERER:  Still it is not an illusion that you listen to a Romantic song, rather than a Rock song, even though a lot of Rock songs are actually romantic.  How is say, the choice between a Rock station and a Romantic station (if there are such things), an illusion rather than a choice?   Would you choose to listen to either sort of station if you realized that your house was on fire?  Or would you choose to leave the burning house and listen to any kind of music later, when you were safe outside?    QUESTIONNER:  I am posting this question here because of curiosity..curiosity that God embedded in us..i am helpless..i cannot fight the fact that this issue is bugging me deeply & i don't think i can put a meaning to life without an explanation to it....    ANSWER:  O.K.  First you have to know what a WILL is in order to determine if that WILL is either "free" or "determined" (unfree; not free).  According to Aristotle, the WILL is a rational appetite for a desired good.  It makes no difference whether the good (desired thing) is a real good or a merely apparent good.  As you say, we are limited beings.  But does that mean we are limited to single choices alone and always choose what we must necessarily choose?  How could that be, when given identical choices, different people choose different things all the time?  Why are there 100's of Channels of Television and of Radio Stations, if human beings are so limited in their choices?  Why so many choices in books, food, etc. etc.?    Why are there people like Ghandi, who go on hunger strikes when they see their friends (Hindus and Muslims) fighting?  Why do other people run away, rather than hunger-striking or fighting?  Why do still others join the fight on one side or the other side, if they can't choose to run away, fight or protest the fight, as Ghandi did?    In short, if there weren't choices, all human behaviour would be identical in identical situations.    QUESTIONNER:  The only way i can think of free-will is if God really exists and the only condition which enables you to freely choose is to either choose God ,if he truly exists, or to continue being brainwashed by this world's fake and shitty values and morals....the concept of free-will is made-up...we can never be free unless we die...we must be unlimited beings....    REPLY:  But even among people who choose God, they still have their choices as to which religion to choose among a huge selection.  Then even among that huge selection of choices in religious beliefs and practices various exemplary religious believers in God do not all make the same choices or have the same kinds of life.  Ghandi rejected Christianity because the Christians he knew were so obviously anti Christian in their behaviours and choices.  So he stuck with Hinduism.  But he still was an exemplary "Christian" in his behaviour --- forgiving enemies, etc. etc.  The "idea" of so-called "brain-washing" is far more dubious than free will.  Do you really think that anyone could "brain-wash-you" into only making the choices that they tell you are the only choices you can make?    QUESTIONNER (requote):  ...we can never be free unless we die...we must be unlimited beings....    REPLY:  Death is far more limiting than life.  When you die there are 2 options, which you won't have a choice about at all.  The first possibility is (1) Something like an eternal dreamless sleep.  The second possibility is (2) Another life, according to many religions, where, again, there are 2 options, about which you have little arguable "choice", to wit (1) Heaven or (2) Hell.    Again those 2 possibilities and the 2 options included in the 2nd possibility sound like severely limited non-choices.  Better to stay alive where you have an almost unlimited number of choices, time and again, to work your way toward 3 limited possibilities:-  (1) A dreamless sleep; (2) Heaven; or (3) Hell.    QUESTIONNER:  so tell me what you think...true?...or help me understand otherwise..thank you    REPLY:  I think free will exists, whereas after death "choices" are the actual illusions.    Kevin

AA10015648	Catcher in the Rye has a really depressing mood but Holden's tone is always pretty sarcastic and light.|`|AA11703549	Yeah, I've never read a good explanation of mood and tone in a text book. It's a very tricky difference in defnition and it's even harder to identify when you read something but heres how I understand it:    Tone is the feelings that the author puts into the writing. Think of it as the "tone of voice" he's using, in the same way the "tone of voice" that your mother uses.     Mood is how you feel because of it. Sometimes the sync up so that the tone of the author is the same as the mood that you get from it. But sometimes they're different. Like if the author used a very sarcastic tone, it might make you feel a little resentment or anger...or humor. It really depends.     So just think: Tone-author's feelings. Mood-your feelings.|`|oF4HDT5Zaa	mood: your emotion  tone: how you express|`|YJcd8OAeaa	the mood is like the background music of jaws... it raises the suspense.  the tone is how someone sounds, like dracula saying "good evening".    in a book, they would say the setting for the right mood and the characters/narrator would say things that helps set the mood.|`|UhWTJkI2aa	What is the difference between tone and mood?    Tone typically refers to the emotional atmosphere the writer establishes and maintains through the entire novel.  One of the easiest ways to peg the tone is to identify the book's genre, or if it doesn't have a genre, the overall feel of it.     For example--(remember that I use my own works in examples whenever possible to avoid having to get permissions; it's quicker)--LADY LIBERTY is a suspense   novel.  It has a romantic element, a mystery element, and, further defining it:  spy, intrigue, espionage, thriller, and techno-thriller elements.    I'm using it as an example because MOST books have a combination of genre-specific elements.  The key to the novel's tone is in the balance of those elements.  Which element dominates the novel?  Answer that, and you'll nail your book's tone.    In LADY LIBERTY, the suspense is the dominant element.  The reason the combination of genres works is because every other element supports and relies on the suspense.  You can't separate the suspense from any of the other elements without leaving a hole, if you will, in the book.  Think of it as subsidiary interdependence.  Any one non-dominate element in the book disappears and the dominate element in the book has a gap.      That gap can be in logic, motivation, character (establishing, maintaining, or growth), or even in setting.  Whatever it is, it'll leave the book with a foundation missing one of its corners, which means it won't be able to support the weight of the novel convincingly.    A lot of writers get into trouble by constructing the novel with multiple dominating elements.  (Example:  suspense and romance elements.)  The challenge comes in when the writer gives equal weight to both elements.  When that happens, neither element can carry the weight it needs to carry; it can't because it's diffused by the other dominate element.  So the reader's attention, interest, and absorption in the story is diffused, torn between the two elements. To correct this, make one element dominant, and make the other element secondary and dependent on the dominant element.    In LADY LIBERTY, the dominant element is the suspense.  Will Sybil and Jonathan get the briefcase back to D.C. in time to stop the first-strike launch of a Peacekeeper missile that will start World War III?  The secondary element is a romance between Jonathan and Sybil.  If they fail in their quest to get to D.C., they--and a lot of other people--are going to die.  There won't be a romance because they won't survive.  See the dependence?    As you are writing, ask yourself how you are reacting emotionally to the work as a whole.  Is the book serious, lighthearted, mysterious, gripping, funny?  That is the tone of the book.      While experts vary--some use the terms tone, mood, and style interchangeably--the difference I best relate to is that tone references the book as a whole while mood references the characters' (and thus the readers') emotional reactions to the events occurring in the scenes of the book, and the emotions aroused in the characters/readers by the overall book.    The mood of the book might be dark when the tone isn't.  I'm thinking of the honeymoon story with Gilda Radner (Saturday Nite Live) and Gene Wilder (of   Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory fame) in the haunted mansion.  I apologize, but the name of the film escapes me at the moment.  Maybe, HAUNTED HONEYMOON, or something like that.  Anyway, I'm sure you remember the movie.  The point is the mood in that movie is deliberately dark and spooky.  But the tone is comedy.      The mood shifts and changes from scene to scene to mirror the emotional mood of the point of view character in that scene.  (Occasionally a stark contrast is used for impact, but generally, you want the external mood [situation and setting] to mirror the internal mood of the point of view character.  It is through this venue that the writer incites the reader to react to novel events as the writer wants the reader to act to those events.    Remember, everything in any scene is filtered through the point of view character's senses, perceptions, and current emotional status.  That is the way it's related to the reader.  (This holds true, even if the point of view character is a narrator not actually present in the scene.  Still, the reader experiences the story through the narrator's perceptions and what that narrator chooses to relate, and chooses not to relate.  How much weight or importance that character places on what is being relayed.)    An "imagine" example this time.      Imagine yourself standing before a Christmas tree.  The lights are lit.  It's Christmas Eve.  The family is all home.  It's warm and fuzzy and you're sipping a little eggnog, staring into the lights dreaming and thinking sometimes life is just so good.    Now imagine yourself in that same setting.  Only there is no family.  You came home from work and your spouse had taken the kids and left

OmSJR5UFaa	The New Deal was Franklin D. Roosevelt's answer to the Depression.    Nothing was done for civil rights during this time, as the armed forces and other entities were still segregated.  Civil rights was not an issue then.    The New Deal DID provide many new jobs that anyone could take, and that eased the pain of the times.  While civil rights reform was not an issue with the New Deal, many people did find gainful employment during the Depression.    Civil rights reform did not come until much later; 30 or more years later.|`|1Gm1m30qaa	The New Deal improved civil rights, but not by very much. There was the "Black Cabinet" formed which gave Black intellectuals more influence plus many black people found employment and a stable working life. However FDR unfortunately didn't ban lynching. (It is worthwhile to note that because of FDR's civil rights policy that the African-American vote moved from Republican to Democrat)
37evQRaDaa	You can make a nice looking guitar from easily obtainable materials.

They are both just statements truncated and written in single lines.  Sorry, but poetry is not simply achieved by writing down your thoughts! You have to make it flow, rhyme, say something relevant to others. pass on insights perhaps or say something inspirational, or sad, or wise.

Today, professional people commonly emigrate because of better opportunities elsewhere. Such emigration has sometimes been called brain drain. Many doctors and nurses and numerous engineers and scientists have moved to the United States.    Wars, revolutions, and political unrest have driven innumerable people to find new homes. In the 1980's alone, millions of refugees fled from warfare in Afghanistan, Iran, Uganda, Southeastern Asia, and Central America    The United States has long been the world's chief receiving nation for immigrants and refugees. The country has had four major periods of immigration. The first wave began in what is now the United States with the colonists of the 1600's (came from England. Many other colonists came from France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden, and Wales. Some colonists came from Denmark, Finland, and what is now Ukraine)and reached a peak just before the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775.     The second major flow of immigrants started in the 1820's and lasted until a depression in the early 1870's.     The greatest inpouring of people took place from the 1880's to the early 1920's(English immigrants came, while the number from Germany, Ireland, and Scotland rose sharply. Most immigrants arrived in Philadelphia, the main port in the colonies). A fourth and continuing wave began in 1965 because of changes in U. S. Immigration laws.

Unless you're, say, a mechanical engineer specializing in windmills will you have a specific career lined up for you.  Most jobs prefer some form of general qualification, such as an economics degree if you're going to run a store for a major company.  Philosophy degrees, as with most humanities degrees, are useful in that they are degrees that pretty much say "Hey, I can think."  Any intelligent employer would employ a philosophy student to a job that doesn't need specific, off-the-job training.      For a philosophy specific career you're mostly limited to writing and teaching.  If you're going to teach a masters will most likely confine you to the high-school level whereas a phd allows you to teach in universities.  In terms of writing, most philosophy writing done professionally, but outside academia, must be softened for the general public or else it would go right over their heads or, sadly, be boring.    Hope this helped.
cSBZQfaIaa	A remarkable achievement was the turning of the Cape of Good Hope by Bartolomeu Dias in 1487; the richness of India was now accessible, hence the name of the cape. In 1489, the King of Bemobi gave his realms to the Portuguese king and became Christian. Between 1491 and 1494, Pro de Barcelos and Jo?o Fernandes Lavrador explored North America. At the same time, Pro da Covilh? reached Ethiopia by land. Vasco da Gama sailed for India, and arrived at Calicut on 20 May 1498, returning in glory to Portugal the next year. The Monastery of Jernimos was built, dedicated to the discovery of the route to India. In 1500, Pedro lvares Cabral sighted the Brazilian coast; ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa, in India.With this, the Portuguese became the first civilization to fully start the process we know today as globalization.Jo?o da Nova discovered Ascension in 1501 and Saint Helena in 1502; Trist?o da Cunha was the first to sight the archipelago still known by his name 1506. In East Africa, small Islamic states along the coast of Mozambique, Kilwa, Brava and Mombasa were destroyed or became subjects or allies of Portugal.The arrival of the Portuguese in Japan, the first Europeans who managed to reach it, initiating the Nanban ("southern barbarian") period of active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.The two million Portuguese people ruled a vast empire with many millions of inhabitants in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. From 1514, the Portuguese had reached China and Japan. In the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, one of Cabral's ships discovered Madagascar (1501), which was partly explored by Trist?o da Cunha (1507); Mauritius was discovered in 1507, Socotra occupied in 1506, and in the same year Louren?o de Almeida visited Ceylon. In the Red Sea, Massawa was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under Estev?o da Gama penetrated as far as Suez. Hormuz, in the Persian Gulf, was seized by Afonso de Albuquerque in 1515, who also entered into diplomatic relations with Persia. In 1521, a force under Antonio Correia conquered Bahrain ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago (for further information see Bahrain as a Portuguese dominion). On the Asiatic mainland the first trading-stations were established by Pedro lvares Cabral at Cochin and Calicut (1501); more important, however, were the conquest of Goa (1510) and Malacca (1511) by Afonso de Albuquerque, and the acquisition of Diu (1535) by Martim Afonso de Sousa. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent Duarte Fernandes as envoy to Siam (now Thailand) in 1511, and dispatched to the Moluccas two expeditions (1512, 1514), which founded the Portuguese dominion in the Malay Archipelago. Fern?o Pires de Andrade visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China, where in 1557 the Portuguese were permitted to occupy Macau. Japan, accidentally reached by three Portuguese traders in 1542, soon attracted large numbers of merchants and missionaries. In 1522, one of the ships in the expedition that Ferdinand Magellan organized in the Spanish service completed the first voyage around the world.By the end of the 15th century, Portugal expelled some local Jews, along with those refugees that came from Castile and Aragon after 1492. In addition, many Jews were forcibly converted to Catholicism and remained as Conversos. Many Jews remained secretly Jewish, in danger of persecution by the Portuguese Inquisition. In 1506, 3000 "New Christians" were massacred in Lisbon. Many of the merchant Jews who fled reached such prominence in commerce that for centuries a "Portuguese" abroad was presumed a Jew of Portuguese descent.In 1578, a very young king Sebastian died in battle without an heir (the body was not found), leading to a dynastic crisis. The late king's elderly granduncle, Cardinal Henry, became king, but died two years later. Portugal was worried about the maintenance of its independence and sought help to find a new king. Philip II of Spain was on his mother's side the grandson of King Manuel I, and on that basis claimed the Portuguese throne. He was opposed by Antnio, Prior of Crato, the illegitimate son of one of the younger sons of Manuel I. As a result, following Henry's death Spain invaded Portugal and the Spanish king became Philip I of Portugal in 1580; the Spanish and Portuguese Empires came under a single rule. This did not, however, end resistance to Spanish rule. The Prior of Crato held out in the Azores until 1583, and continued to actively seek to recover the throne until his death in 1595. Impostors claimed to be King Sebastian in 1584, 1585, 1595 and 1598. "Sebastianism", the myth that the young king will return to Portugal on a foggy day, has prevailed until modern times.  After the 16th century, Portugal gradually saw its wealth decreasing. Even if Portugal was officially an autonomous state, the country was under the rule of

74edcf791dc4861c0fa85ec65b26f4e3aa	First of all, it will depend on the rules of your library.  If I were you, I would go to the librarian and explain what happened.  Apologize, tell her all the places you've looked, and explain that you have limited resources.  Offer to work off some of the cost or to pay gradually or offer to replace the book:  let it be the librarian's choice.  And be sincere in your apology. People respond more positively when you don't act in a confrontational or defensive manner-- as in, "Your book was already in horrible condition so I shouldn't have to pay much for it."    Also while you might not notice a difference in the book, it's likely the librarian will.  Was it paperback or hardback?  If hardback was it library bound, perma-bound or book club?  If paperback, was it mass market or trade? There are differences in pricing for each of these.  For example, hardcover is $16 list price.      Plus whatever is done, the librarian will still have to process the book to get it ready to check out.  Depending on your system, that may mean barcoding plus removing the barcode from the lost book, accession number, spine label, possibly book pocket, etc.  so it's not like she gets the book and just sticks it back on the shelf.    And who knows-- maybe someone else found it and turned it in already.

k13V3Xj8aa	Take a novel of your choice (a larger one is better just because it has more words)    Your going to have to do a bit of hunting... flip through the novel for a word.  The code will go:    page... paragraph... number of words into the paragraph.    Say I want the word "him" and fond it on page 11, 2nd paragraph, and fourth word.  that would be:    11-2-4    It's nearly impossible to crack because thinkof how many books in the world there are, and you could even mix up the order of how you get to page paragraph number of word.  it might be paragraph number of word and page.      Another thing is you could find multiple codes for the same word like "He"    The flaw to the code is this, you may not have a name you can find that you need or a place... then you need to substitute.    Of course this is a huge amount of work... but it's a serious code.

M2thieHqaa	Social Darwinism means that people or groups will survive where others will not. As in nature, where only the strongest, cleverst animals can survive, so too in society, individuals or groups achieve advantage over others as the result of genetic or biological superiority.    Example: Take six people at a high school in the middle of a big city, say, New York: Andy, Mandy, Randy, Brandy, Sandy, and Candy. They all start Freshman year at the same school. Their goal is to graduate and go on to college.     By the end of Freshman year, they're all still at school, but Sandy has been goofing off in classes, and has a poor GPA, so he has to repeat Freshman year.     Sophomore year, Mandy mouths off to a teacher and gets suspended for a week, and her GPA drops half a point. Andy fails two tests, and has to do three extra credit assignments to keep his grades up. Candy gets pregnant and her parents make her marry the boy and quit school.    Junior Year, Sandy gets tired of being a year behind and drops out and joins the Marines. Randy gets caught dealing coke and is arrested and sent to jail. Mandy and Brandy tie for top honors at school, with Andy a close second.     Senior Year, Andy wins a scholarship to go to Yale. Mandy goes on to Harvard Law. Brandy overslept and missed two final exams, so she graduates with a B-average, but her school science prizes attract notice of a startup, so she goes straight into IT work and never goes to college at all.     That's Social Darwinism.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	Scrooge summed it up in one sentence, when asked to donate to the poor:  "Better that they they should die, and reduce the surplus population."      In other words, Social Darwinism = The idea that just as in the natural world of evolution, human society progresses through a struggle called 'survival of the fittest.'  Governments therefore should not interfere in the economy, since the least fit would not survive, improving the general stock of humanity.  Scrooge said it the hardest way; the kinder Social Darwinists would say the threat of SERIOUS HARM from poverty motivated people to work their way out of poverty.    The main importance of Social Darwinism is that it justified the harshest form of capitalism in the 19th century; by insisting that the government should not provide any aid to those who were poor or lost their jobs.|`|GClXFKp1aa	Social Darwinism refers to various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas drives social evolution in human societies.[1] The term draws upon the common use of the term Darwinism which is a social adaptation of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection which explains speciation in populations as the outcome of competition between individual organisms for limited resources or "survival of the fittest" (a term in fact coined by Herbert Spencer) (also refer to "The Gospel of Wealth" theory written by Andrew Carnegie). The term first appeared in Europe in 1879 and was popularized in the United States in 1944 by the American historian Richard Hofstadter, and has generally been used by critics rather than advocates of what the term is supposed to represent     This is anarchy stemming from the days of Hitler in which he ordered the killing of children, of the aging and old, and of the sickly and hospitalized.  Hitler's reign was to breed human civilization of the strongest, fittest of society.  Blond hair and blued eyed supreme beings.|`|uqb7dkBbaa	Social Darwinism refers to various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas drives social evolution in human societies.  While the term has been applied to the claim that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection can be used to understand the social endurance of a nation or country, social Darwinism commonly refers in fact to eugenics (notions of racial supremacy and purity), an idea that predates Darwin's publication publication of On the Origin of Species. .

(Their economy was far worse because of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that they were forced to sign after the war.) The German government slowly came back, and they were able to pay the war reparations to France, and in turn, France could pay us.     But during this time, there was a stock market crash in the US, and all of a sudden we were the ones that needed money. France and Germany were still taking care of themselves, and didn't have enough money to help us out. This left us in a horrible position, hyper inflation occured, and we were in a lot of trouble.

The immediate stated causes for the U.S. declaration of war were several.  - A series of trade restrictions introduced by Britain to impede American trade with France, a country with which Britain was at war. The U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.   - The capture of men from American vessels for forced service in the Royal Navy. The pretext for impressment was the search for deserters, who, the British claimed, had taken employment on American vessels.  - The alleged British military support for American Indians who were offering armed resistance to the United States.  - America's leaders assumed that Canada could be easily overrun. Former President Jefferson optimistically referred to the conquest of Canada as "a matter of marching." Many Loyalist Americans had migrated to Upper Canada after the Revolutionary War, and it was assumed they would favor the American cause, but they did not. In 181213, British military experience prevailed over inexperienced American commanders.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	For the same reason the USA invaded Mexico, to take land and build a bigger country.

Generally ...Water represents emotion, air...mind, earth... body and fire...spirit    Your house is how you see your life and security. That perception can change and does. Oily can be volatile and foreign-seeming. But we make up our lives, so nothing is really foreign, we just think it is. The more you own the events of your life as being connected to your own thoughts, the clearer your house will become.      crmcc shows the similarities of the two dreams    I commend you for seeking out these answers.|`|Y77wbUZxaa	To dream that you are drowning, indicates that you are feeling overwhelmed by emotions or repressed issues that are coming back to haunt you. You may be proceeding too quickly in trying to discover your unconscious thoughts. You should proceed more cautiously and slowly. If you drown to death, then is refers to an emotional rebirth.  If your survive the drowning, then a waking relationship or situation will ultimately survive the turmoil.|`|N1ot1wpRaa	Anxiety    Also some believe that dreams of water relate to being in the womb, perhaps you are in search of comfort?|`|FCgF4G7Raa	Forgive the pun, but here's a shot in the dark:    The two dreams have interesting similarities.  Since you mentioned them together, it is clear that you believe them (at least subconsciously) to be connected.  You give very little detail about the spider dream, so I have to make some assumptions, but, it seems that the spider dream is somewhat of a decoder for the dream of the following night.  The main elements are:    head == top of the house (where the water comes from)  spiders == dark, oily water (I have to assume that you feel spiders are loathsome and dangerous)    The head is where the the mind, or thoughts and knowledge, is stored.  The idea of the spiders being inside would indicate that they represent bad (loathsome and dangerous) thoughts or knowledge.  I would conclude that you believe (at least subconsciously, but probably more consciously) that you have thoughts or knowledge of something bad or from which some danger may proceed.    The fact that the water (which you describe as "black and oily", or, like the spiders, loathsome and dangerous) comes down from the top, seems to support the idea that it represents dangerous knowledge, or knowledge of something dangerous, or bad thoughts.    The house probably represents security in a general sense, but a house frequently represents, more specifically, the family, which usually provides some degree of both physical and emotional security.    So, we can guess that perhaps you feel that you possess knowledge of something that is dangerous or destructive to your family, and that maybe you are in denial of it, or are not aware of it on a conscious level, and dream these things to help you bring it to a conscious level, or perhaps just to process your fears.    You may feel that some of my assumptions don't ring true to you, which should help prompt a more accurate reading of the symbols of the dream.  In that case, trust your own interpretation, since dreams are very personal, and there is no such thing as a universal symbol dictionary that is accurate for everyone.  Ross's point about including emotions and initial thoughts is very important in this regard.    What you should do about whatever the dreams may mean is beyond the scope of this discussion, but certainly, if you feel you need some help with this issue, get some!

31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	It is not philosophy you are concerned with, it is theology and superstition.  They were puritans|`|NYU37jfGaa	There are different arguments about what started the trials.  Some argue that it was fear of women, or a convenient way to remove social deviants, some argue that it was jealousy between rival families in Salem.  I personally find Robert w. thurston's arguments most persuasive.  In 'Witch, Wicce, Mother Goose' he writes:    'It may well be that the problems of deviance, division, and the situation of some women helped to precipitate the hunt.  But none of the studies that emphasize such themes explain exactly how resentmetns towards one group or another was transformed into charges of witchcraft, or why only that accusation was used to attack the targets.  It is much more important to emphasise the broader set of conditions that contributed to the killings in Salem; first among these were the streams of culture and fear that together helped produce witch hunts in Europe.    Massachusetts in 1692 was, after all, an outpost of Europe and its culture.  The worst local disputes imaginable would simply not hav led to a witch hunt in the colony if its leaders outlook had not been shaped by events in europe.  No European with hunts, no Salem withc hunt, regardless of what any Puritan ever said about a minister, a neighbour or the female sex.     Beyond the point that the European connection and example were crucial to the Salem prosecutions, the trials there would not have taken place in normal  circumstnaces.  Only a unique set of political events, starting with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England which displaced King James II and installed William and Mary in his place, allowed the Massachusetts witch hunt to proceed in the way and on the scale that it did.  Before 1692, witchcraft cases in New England had only involved one or two defendents.  Most accusations of witchcraft did not lead to a trial: those that did usually ended in acquittal.  Juries were often reluctant to convict for witchcraft in the first place.  If they returned a guilty verdict, magistrates who took witch convictions on appeal often exercised their right to oveturn the decision.  Before 1692 there were 93 defendents altogether in witch cases in New england, only 16 of those were executed.'    Robert Thurston goes on to discuss the fact that witch trials were more likely to arise at times of crisis, and that the period of the 1690s was one of unusual tension.    "Besides, the constitutional crisis and all its attendant uncertainty, the times were marked by wars and epidemics.  It seemed to many people that there was a "general movement of Divine Providence against the region."  The situation of the whole colony was still perilous.  It was perched, so the white inhabitants felt, on the edge of civilization.  Beyond it lay savagery, which could unleash death from the forest at any time in the form of Indian attacks.  Yet another war between the English and their Indian allies on one side and the French and their native partners on the other was underway.    If the immediate zone of fighting had been pushed west and north from Salem, it was still not far away, and the village lay at the southern end of a region of marsh and woods open to attacks by the French and their allies.  A number of girls living in Salem in 1692 had recently been orphaned during Indian forays in Maine, some had witnessed the slaughter of their families.    This fluid, dangerous situation added greatly to the tension over witchcraft charges in the village, and perhaps only such a context could have perpared the ground for a sympathetic response to the girls' claims in the first place.  It was certainly unusual for adults, let alone a court, to give such credence to the testimony of children and adolescents.'

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet.    Websites that only have family trees are not worth a plug nickel unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.    I recently found I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1956. Hey! we've been dead for 52 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!    I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.    This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.    Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.     Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.     Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.    However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.    Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.     A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.     They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know.|`|MGvN5xrNaa	There are a couple of options you can try.  One, is that your local Library might have something called Ancestry.com Library Edition.    The Library Edition is free, but not all Library's have it. It's been a great service for me, because right now, I can't afford a genealogy service right now either:)    Also, you could try to google: Free Genealogy Sites, and you might get something.   Sometimes, you might have to sign-up with a free account in order to get records.     This website sounds like it's free: http://www.myheritage.com/research    But, you have to install it and sign -up first:)|`|7ea179b9fcb52a29dc4e3fcfdafa0addaa	Im looking up my family tree also, and I haven't found any FREE sites either.  Ancestry.com, Genebase.com, sometimes you can get a little info from the sites. Look up anything like ancestry, genealogy.com , my family tree,Laterday saint  site ( they are Mormans and suppose to have the best site, but I think you still have to pay.  Hope any of this helps tojen

KH3kbRjgaa	This is Shakespeare's Sonnet 116. The subject of this poem is love and the main theme is that love endures. (Stanza 1) - Love does not change. If a person is really in love he or she would not have to make changes in their lover to make themself happy, and that love cannot be taken back. (Stanza 2) - Love is ever-lasting and can be used as a guide in life. Compares love to the North Star, which is a guide for barks, or ships. By following their hearts, people can use love as a guide to get them through life. (Stanza 3) - Love is independent of time. Even though beauty fades with time, love does not. He also personifies death in line nine when he refers to the bending sickle, which would be the weapon of the infamous Grimm Reaper. Death can take away physical traits, but not true love. (Stanza 4) - The poet-speaker boasts how confident he is in his opinion of love, suggesting that if his opinion is wrong, no one has ever loved.?|`|5k2GI5ZYaa	true love does not seek faults or become shaky when troublec come  True live is Uncondtional and steadfast!|`|ome7FND9aa	??? ???|`|0BioKSmaaa	wow i have noooo idea....and this is like the 5th time iv read it :S  maybe you should google the poem and find some reviews of the poem or like sites where his poetry has been analyzed.....|`|ElTNcN2Uaa	Shakespeare is telling the  person to whom he wrote (unknown, but who's identity had been debated for over four centuries) that when he re-meets the person whom he once loved, even though she is now in QUITE different circumstances...she's older, maybe married...she's STILL the person whom he loved more than his life itself. Just being in her prescence again, after THIRTY YEARS is a mystery in that it's STILL HER. Love is NOT time's fool, that is, love is enduring and doesn't depend on time to continue to exist.

n71t0xoCaa	You can use this camera to photograph under all conditions but you have to set the controls yourself  1) set the ISO to the same ISO/ASA as the film you put in the camera, you have to lift the dial and turn it till your iso is in the window. Yes you can push or pull film but for now just set it at the films rated ISO  2) The same dial you raised and turned to set the ISO turn without raising to set your shutter speed,  3) look through the viewfinder,  turn on the meter by pulling the film advance lever slightly away from the camera body there will be a guage ( the readout for your light meter)  at the side that has a plus at the top an o in the middle and a  minus  at the bottom. If the red light is at the plus you are over exposed , if its at the minus you are underexposed and the zero is just right. turn the aperature till you get the light by the zero. If you cannot get it where you want adjust the shutter speed up or down as needed and try again    Yes this is over simplified and as you learn more you will want to work towards specific aperatures or shutter speeds for effects you want/ Each full f stop of aperature will either double or cut your light in half as will each change in shutter speed. So f4 at 1/125 gives you the same exposure as f5.6 at 1/60 sec    Another way to start out is the sunny 16 rule     1)  Set your  aperature  to f/16. If you dont have strong sunlight, use the  list tbelow o determine your starting f-number.     2) Take note of your ISO or film speed (lets call it X). Now set your shutter speed to 1/X. So at ISO 400, youd use a shutter speed of 1/400 seconds.      3) You may want to use different shutter speeds or f-numbers. You can adjust one as long as you adjust the other accordingly. Opening up by one full f-number requires cutting your shutter speed in half (and visa versa).     VARIATIONS ON SUNNY 16  f/16 for Sunny   f/11 for Slight Overcast   f/8 for Overcast   f/5.6 for Heavy Overcast   f/4 for Sunset|`|oXPDFw4daa	The FM (and its successor models) include a built-in light meter that will help you get the exposure right.  To use it, you must first program in the film speed by turning the film speed dial on the top of the camera until the line on the camera matches the film speed on the dial.     You turn on the meter by pulling the film advance lever away from the camera body.      Look through the viewfinder.  You will see a set of LEDs on the right side of the field.  The + LED indicates overexposure, while the - LED indicates underexposure.  You can adjust the exposure by varying either the aperture setting or the shutter speed setting.  When the exposure is correct according to the meter, you will see an O LED.    If the LEDs don't work, you should check the battery.  The FM is a manual camera, and the shutter mechanism is spring driven.  So the only purpose for the battery is to operate the meter.  If you have recently acquired a used camera, it would be prudent to simply replace the battery.|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	Many people live by the sunny F/16 rule. It works well.    Investing in a used incident light meter can be a big help as well.

You can read the story here:  http://stenzel.ucdavis.edu/180/anthology...|`|42WmRqNoaa	The Greek historian Strabo (Geographica Book 17, 1.33) recorded in the 1st century BC the tale of the Greco-Egyptian girl Rhodopis, which is considered the oldest known version of the story.|`|VQ5gX1m0aa	CINDERELLA|`|8xzYJt1aaa	Aschenputtel  its in german. that's where it originated|`|fI4LqMVMaa	Cinderella" is a very ancient tale tale with many variants.  It's hard to know which one really was the first cinderella, and they all are a little different.      The Greek historian Strabo (Geographica Book 17, 1.33) recorded in the 1st century BC the tale of the Greco-Egyptian girl Rhodopis, which is considered by wikipedia to be the oldest known version of the story.       A version called "Ye Xian" dates back to the seventh century AD.  Some say the Chinese gave the world the earliest written version of the Cinderella story:    An aboriginal cave man named Li Shi-Yuan from Yungchow told the story to Tuan Chengshih in the 9th century Tang period. This was seven centuries earlier than the European version by Des Perriers.    The first Cinderella was a Chinese cave woman named Yeh Hsien. Her fairy godfather, a goldfish spirit, descended from the sky with disheveled hair and in ragged garments. When her evil stepmother ordered her to stay home from the Cave Festival to guard the fruit orchard, she went anyway, wearing a green silk dress and slippers given her by the goldfish spirit.    The stepsister saw her and said: "Is that girl not strangely like my elder sister?"  So Yeh Hsien ran home, where they later found her asleep with her arms around a tree. Tree-hugging duty was taken seriously in those days. Otherwise, some tree spirits could get nasty. ( In fact, that is why, here in Modesto, many tree spirits have committed suicide by jumping in front of cars. They feel un-loved! So do your part, and hug a tree everyday!)    The cave people sold the slipper she lost in flight to a nearby island kingdom. The slipper was one inch too little for any of the island women, so the king tracked down Yeh Hsien and married her.     The evil stepmother and sisters soon got their comeuppance when they were killed by flying stones. Their tomb was called: "The Tomb of Regretful Women".    Today, Americans have adopted Cinderella (alias Yeh Hsien) as their own symbol of an oppressed underdog rising to top dog. She is an American tradition.    Several different variants of the story also appear in the medieval One Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, including "The Second Shaykh's Story", "The Eldest Lady's Tale" and "Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harrassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others they are male. One of the tales, "Judar and His Brethren", departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.      The 'modern' version was first written down by Frenchman Charles Perrault in 1697.  It was also recorded by the brothers grimm in their book of fairy tales.
g8kIjpwSaa	Yep, because it's drying, the water is leaving the clay which lessens its weight.|`|BpW5wcV1aa	Yes. I should know i did a project using clay and it got lighter.
g8kIjpwSaa	You've got the equipment. And actually, you can even get that effect with a crappy wacom bamboo and photoshop 7. Is al about your skill. Unfortunately, digital illustration i something you have to get good at through experimentation. It takes time. And there aren't any very good online tutorials for that kind of thing. At last none that are any help.    But, take some sample artwork and try to replicate a small part of it. An eye or a shoulder. Experiment with your brush presets. The best site I know to give you about Photoshop brushes is this.... good luck!    http://augustc4.deviantart.com/art/Spicy...

LVZdzPmpaa	If you post an essay in an online forum, that is not publishing. It is posting. The essay would be eligible for submission in a venue that required previously unpublished pieces.    If the rules stated that the submission must have never been seen before by human eyes, then you'd have an issue. But posting it online does not count as publishing because you are the one who posted it.    If you sold it to an online site, it would no longer be consider "not published." But YOU choosing to post it somewhere is not considered "publishing" in the sense intended by the restrictions of other journals.    Your essay is eligible for submission to the college journal. If it is chosen for publication, it is then consider "published." Whether it can then be offered to other entitites depends on what kind of rights you agreed to in the first publication.

He is late to school  5.  His teachers yell at him  6. He fails his math test.  7. etc.  8. etc.    and so on and so on    In the end he wakes up from his dream, he realizes it was a nightmare, and goes to school.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	I would work out a plot as if it was going to be about an hour in length.

4lm0oj2caa	It was actually a propaganda movie made by Nazis. Then the posters followed. http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...  It's intention was to present Jews and their traditions as inferior and negative. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eternal...    To Spooky: these are two different movies, The Eternal Jew was a pseudo-documentary production while Jud S? was based on an anti-semit 19th century novel.  And yes, people do realise that Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia .... and that it is made by users ...|`|qDSvOOwBaa	I believe you have your movies mixed up. Or someone has changed the entry in Wiki for political reasons.    Of all Nazi propaganda films with an antisemitic message, Jud Suss was without doubt the most popular. I have the poster from that film and it was a full length movie that was seen by over 5 million across Europe. The Eternal Jew was much different and somehow you have got the posters mixed up-remember Wikipedia in NOT an Encyclopedia as it can be changed by users.  If you send me the poster if you are not sure.    s_e_s

There is also "the turn of the screw" a novel of horror with a governess by Henry James (i don't know how difficult that is as a book, I haven't read that).|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice.

	The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury is a collection of short stories I know of. His style is sort of eerily detached. He mostly uses the characters to propel the stories forward, to the climax, and to the end.|`|U2wkJRrMaa	Have you ever read 'The Lottery' by Shirley Jackson?
AA11830534	Wow, this is a difficult one to analyze, at least for me.  Thus far I like Wraxitor's explanation best.   It does say in the bible that "God is a jealous God" so with that idea in mind I thought that perhaps she was speaking about not "feeling welcome in the house of prayer" which I interpreted as the possibility that she felt unwelcome because of her sexuality, which a lot of "houses of prayer" would find ungodly. The fact that she went to this place, to me expressed that she wanted acceptance in this "house of prayer" but found none there because God is a jealous God and finds only those who adhere to his "rules" so to speak, as acceptable. (not that I agree)  she also continues to identify herself as a jealous dog, So at some level I felt she was comparing herself to God, and feeling that she knew what it was like to be a jealous dog....but at the same time warning against it.   The friend who licks his plate? Does so out of some independence and no need to ask for or need (acceptance?) from others. She admires this quality, because in essence her friend is not a jealous dog, as she is, and as God is.  Does that make any sense at all?  Beats me, but it was an effort.  I found it to be contemplative, and sad at the same time.   Please repond and let me know if you "got" me at all on this.  Peace,  Belle|`|QcoYdateaa	I came in late so I am colored by what you see in the song & yes I do see it. I really like the analogy of licking the plate clean in the last verse. Thanx.|`|YmtNel5haa	well , it was different than what I expected.  really peaceful, kind of sad , pretty and tranquil.  I don't really get it as a relationship with God. It kind of seems like a life in general statement.  No offense or anything but I can kind of see why you are down today.  KD Lang is a woman right?  (the person below me keeps saying guy?|`|f2cQrG7jaa	It means that god is the jar this guy can throw all of his problems into. That god somehow is to blame. It's incredibly convenient to not take credit, because you never necessarily have to. God represents (to him) this place where he can put all his faith (blame, same thing). Credit and blame, faith and blame, fame and blame. This guy ought to just figure out he's wrong finally so that he can move on.|`|VoJR0a2Eaa	Nice music. Very relaxing.|`|spYpsixUaa	St. Sixedog!    It's a beautiful irony song about the warning against being something (a Jealous dog, in this case) closing with the realization that the song-writer (in us, to generalize the message) has always been the thing being decried.  But it is also a reaction to being greeted by a "jealous dog."  I like it, because it really gives several sides to the expression clearly and really brings it home.
UzJBYk5zaa	I read best curled up on my couch. It's quiet and isolated, at least for a few hours a day. Sadly, I don't get to take advantage of it as often as I'd like...    LOL Have a star for being incredibly honest :)|`|RZPLec5Eaa	On the couch is where I normally end up reading.  But, I love reading, so I'll read anywhere!  Another place I read a lot is on a plane.  An exception to the reading anywhere is in the car -- I get car sick. =/|`|R0iHHPqEaa	on the beach on a nice 80 degree day or by the pool. when the sun is out and i've got a great book in my hands and some snacks and a water in a comfortable chair. Nothing beats that!|`|Y0ffbZKraa	Anywhere!|`|4wm5kAygaa	I like to read in my bedroom, on the couch and strangely on the floor with a pillow in my front room.

I take a book, well my Sony Reader out with me even shopping, as I always pop for a coffee somewhere.    Favourite place is the local cemetary just up the road from where I live, its very peaceful.    I read in the car waiting in traffic snarls too, it came in handy when hubby's car broke down too as I had something to do! And when I visit my sister on the yorkshire coast I have a special rock near the harbour where I sit and read when the tide is out!|`|V1x2UJpMaa	I love to read under my trampoline in my backyard.

So all i can hear is my own thoughts and the pages turning.  In the sumer if theres no one outside then i will read out there.  But not very ften because normaly i stay out there for ages and get sun burt lol.     I would love to try and read on a rollorcoaster  no im totaly kiddin lol  ahaha  uurrm im not sure achaly  yeah the countryside seems a good idea. But because my Nan lives in the countryside i could always just take a book down there.  So i would have to say.....urrrm....im not to sure lol.  Im quit happy sitting in bed reading it.  xx|`|RKxY9ohXaa	Just not a place with volume all the way up.

But the place itself has to be connected to me in some way. For instance - when the mood is bad I hop into my car and drive away to a nearby small village, where my family used own a cottage when I was a little girl (I spent my happy childhood there). I sit in my car, reading quietly, glancing now and then at the cottage. It's a bit crazy, but I like it for it helps me. Try to think about a place like that:)  And happy reading.
AA12237467	woah.... yes i agree|`|sZjOvy0caa	Carlisle rocks!|`|TjzaAdYeaa	No, he isn't.  Yes he did know esme as a TEENAGER but even then they had a connection.  When she was dying they still had the connection.  Edward did the same for Bella when she was dying, granted he knew her longer but if you read his side of the story he only knew her for a few days before he had a connection with her.  Yes, Elizabeth dad ask him to change Edward. But she knew that he could, and he had no family outside of his parents.  He changed Rosalie because he thought she would be Edwards lifetime partner and because she was dying in the most horrible way possible. She however was NOT a teenager.  Rosalie felt strongly for Emmett because he reminded her of a little boy from her previous life. Carlisle changed him so Rosalie could have a life partner. He, again, was NOT a teenager.  Japer and Alice found them on their own.  And Carlisle agreed to change Bella bacuse Edward would finally have someone to love after years of having no one.  And he doesn't change other people because he would have A) more people in their coven and it would make them look more suspicious. B) They would suffer for days and he would have to keep them away from humans for years...creating lots of rumors.    So no, I  don't find him creepy.  The ONLY teenager he changed was Edward.|`|mRr9TU7Kaa	NO!!  Are you crazy?  Your creepy for asking this question!!|`|FNwYzjogaa	I like how he works as a doctor. That's like an ex-alcoholic working in a bar. Temptation is everywhere.|`|5iMja1Meaa	No! Carlisle is awesome.    :)|`|vkhWdBLpaa	hm.. you do make a good point but No I guess he only changes teens because adults have already lived theyre lives! lol IDK why but hes not creepy|`|Er4le3okaa	I dont, I find him really nice.   I guess he saved teenagers because they still had their whole life in front of them and I guess he feels more sympathy for boys since he is a man himself and understands more that they would'nt want  to die as teens..:)
9HCypvHJaa	No. If you are creative enough you should not have a problem with writing a story about wizards. And besides, J.K. Rowling was just writing down her ideas, it's not like she was purposely trying to "ruin it" for you. Have you ever read A Wizard of Earthsea, by Ursula K. Le Guin? It is about a boy wizard who goes to wizarding school, and it is nothing like Harry Potter.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Read this board and see how wildly fashionable vampire stories are. Adolescent girls especially can't get enough of them. I don't see why magic should be any different if you can come up with a good story.|`|FNwYzjogaa	No. Absolutely not. Anyone can use those topics. Every idea has been used at least once, the trick is to keep writing them in new and exciting ways.|`|6bdbbP2Qaa	Not at all. Any book idea will more than likely get responses of 'That's a Harry Potter rip off!', but vampire books with be compared to Twilight, dragon books will be compared to the Inheritance Trilogy(I am currently working on a dragon novel) and mermaid books will be compared to to The Little Mermaid(I just read a post on such a topic)    The only thing you can do is write your book and hope people like it. If you never try, you will never succeed. Ignore the crap people give you, learn from the constructive critism, and do what you love.|`|Y0ffbZKraa	Of course not, how silly. It's only a problem if you were going to write that exact same story or something almost exactly the same (say, Harvey Smith?) When it comes to magic and fantasy books, or any fiction at all, the possibilities are endless. If you write about a male wizard, he will only be associated with HP if his initials are HP or if it's almost exactly like the Harry Potter books. Use your imagination.|`|AA11212102	Homer who? Dear soul seeker please write to you heart content. Yes, please tell your story. But, read a few more books. The Homeric classics such as The Odyssey. There is room enough for any character you want to put out there. Check out the "Dreseden Files"|`|xH87SKENaa	Yes and no, it depends what you're writing about a evil wizard trying to take over the world, then yes, but you can still get around all other things she's come up with.  I do think that it has ruined writers who want to write about boy wizards, but I think that if you had a good enough idea you could get around it.|`|EWiw3ECWaa	Ruined it, no. Made it a hell of a lot harder, definatly. Who ever comes next is either going to have to be very orginal or wait a couple years at the least.  The Lord of the Rings, didn't kill fantasy, but it sure did raise the standard.

cGtw97maaa	get an agent, go to open casting calls, and audition for everything, especially things like commercials and extras. take tv production and drama and comprehensive theater in high school and then maybe after you graduate there are awesome programs in new york for actors|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Let me say this loud and clear:    If you want to be anything more than the CW's flavor of the month you need professional training.  There are so many people who are so clueless as to the importance of training.  Work hard in highschool specifically with focus on english and literature in addition to any of the theatrical courses (including stagecraft) your school may offer; involve yourself in community theatre; and begin to search for a good acting program either locally (at a university) or afar (New York, England, Russia).      Many people don't understand how much of a legup a good training program can grab you.  Not only does it allow some early networking, but it also introduces you to such names as Meisner, Stanislavsky, and often trains you in movement, voice, and speech (which is a lot more important than you would think.  Your regional dialect will hold you back.)|`|KBBonf97aa	You can actually get started long before you go to college.  Many theaters offer acting classes taught by their own actors.  You could contact an area theater and see what's available.  Also, if you volunteer with the theater, you'll become a familiar face.  If you're already involved as a volunteer and taking classes, the theater regulars will take you seriously when auditions roll around.  Since most kids your age are more interested in becoming stars than becoming good actors, your commitment will give you a huge advantage over your peers.  And once you've appeared in a few productions, you'll have a resume you can use to shop for an agent who may be able to find paid work for you.    Another advantage of involvement at the local level is the networking opportunities it offers.  Many stage actors also work in film, so they'll be able to tell you about auditions that might not be announced to the public.  Also, movies and TV shows often shoot on location and contact local theaters seeking candidates for extra and supporting roles.  If you've already demonstrated your talent, it's likely your theater peers would recommend you for roles that suit your talents.    The vast majority of the people you see on TV and in movies started out in theater, since it's the best place to master the craft of acting, gain experience and explore the sort of opportunities available to actors.  Most A-list actors still make room in their schedules to return to the stage, since it's like coming home to them.  They have an infinite number of takes to get a scene right for a movie, but the stage isn't so forgiving.  Theater actors must recreate the same characters night after night without allowing their performances to become stale and predictable.    Since you're young and will have to rely on your parents' support to test the waters in theater, don't worry too much if they're not enthusiastic.  You'll have opportunities to be in plays and musicals once you're in high school and those are great learning experiences, as well.  Good luck to you!|`|0PbYE3M7aa	go to open casting calls.|`|16599192a4ef948196bd73509cffe2b1aa	Get head shots then an agent and they will do the rest|`|IXhtDPc8aa	acting don't need college to learn it     It depending on the nature of the person , if you have good reasons and ability to be good actor then you should make a good relationship with directors.      good luck|`|AFtSPEaqaa	get a manager. they get you gigs and auditions. also go to acting classes. that will help with landing a role. hope i helped!|`|f5102665c0d003999bcb3d1a399fb55eaa	im a  junior right now and I'm actually also working on my acting career. Well for now you can join actor workshops ( i got to a actors workshop in a community center, so its free, and its very good ). You can join your drama club in school and do some school productions. That way when you set up your resume in the future you can have something to put on it.  Any extra things like dancing and music is also good to put on a resume.     When your ready you should get your headshots done and make a few copies to send out to a few different agencies because some won't accept you, and some will.   And the agent should help you with your auditions. The agent basically gets the job for you, all you have to do is show up to the audition and do your best. Also keep in mind that a legit agency won't make you pay a cent till you get a job and then you owe your agent 15 percent or 20 percent of your pay ( it depends on what they say )    Good Luck

There is no time for running. There is only time to fight back and win!    Running ain't gonna solve the problems, it's just going to make them bigger.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	There is no such thing as "Holga film."  Most Holga cameras just use 120 film, which is a standard medium format film.  It has been around since the 1900's.  Holgas are just cheap plastic lomography cameras, they don't use any special kind of film.  They just use 120 roll film, which is a standard type of film that is used in many different kinds of cameras.    I don't know about that particular Brownie camera, but a lot of old Brownie box cameras did use 120 film (some others use 620 or 127 film).  You can look in the film compartment, and sometimes there will be a label that actually says what kind of film the camera uses.    If it does use 120 film, then in you're in luck because you can still get 120 film.  You can buy it from a camera shop, or order it online.    EDIT:  Thumbs down?  Okay, then.

46zxsu1haa	The mesh sheer seemed tights really make your legs look much more defined then regular tights. Often schools let the upper levels wear them.  If your seemed tights were the sheer mesh type, you got a real bargain for $1!!! I used to always wear that type when I would go for an audition.  They are not as comfortable as regular tights are but they sure do make your legs look good.|`|41943e98f32b9f7d35304507f523d6d7aa	i think it's just preference.  some studios may have different dress codes for different levels...  seamed tights also help your teacher see your turnout.|`|Dp9F20QSaa	i love seemed tights they are the best she probably just moved up a level and her dresscode was changed

xfqHi1tRaa	At a guess, Italy.  Seriously, you need to be more specific. Do you mean Italian immigration to the US or other places? Do you mean the history of Italy in general?    EDIT: OK -- that helps. Well, as you can probably imagine, Italy has a fantastic history and there's no way to post it all here. However, I think if you go through this website, you'll get a good beginning!  http://www.arcaini.com/ITALY/ItalyHistor...|`|abc10c081ca55f358d27b9acde1ea0b7aa	There is a brief history of Italy on Wiki    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...    But you might want to find out which part of Italy your family came from.  That will narrow your research.  Are any of your grandparents still living?  They might have some information on your background and where their parents came from.    Your library is a good resource for books on the history of particular countries.
AA11120822	Okay, my personal ideas in a nutshell (I don't have religious beliefs):  I tend to think the meaning of life is to learn and experience all that you can. And when you "die", perhaps your consciousness returns to the collective, universal consciousness from whence it came and imparts all your knowledge and life experiences.  Since nothing we know of in the universe just ceases to exist, I don't believe death is the end. The idea of reincarnation makes sense, but I don't see it as the same individual traveling from life to life. I see it more like scooping a cup of water out of the ocean, pouring it back in, and then scooping out water again with a second cup - you might get a tiny amount of the same water in the second cup, but it's mostly different water.  Again, this isn't a theory or a belief, because there's no real evidence to back it up. But it's an idea that makes sense to me.|`|FoIxsunVaa	I spend 30% of my time in YA! answering this ONE QUESTION. THANKS TO THAT, life is slowly losing all meaning.    Thanks for contributing to my mental decimation.    As a taoist my religious belief is that what is IS. My personal belief is almost identical except less religious about it.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	We live for the benefit of all other humans. Through collective memory and communication we have used an impressive amount of our human capacity. Might be an unlimited capacity for all I know.     I don't believe in any other belief than personal. Religious people take what is convenient from the organized belief system and adapt to it. No two people have the same beliefs (my belief). The "meaning" behind the things we do is just as convenient any blame. We always are searching to establish things so they don't have to be unknown anymore, but like everything it too will change and again be unknown.    It's convenience, I think.|`|MPtt9wPjaa	I believe that we are in fact reincarnated. You do deeds , good or bad in one life, and they determine your life in the next. I believe that we are a soul, the body is house. We live in a house until God decides our work is done, and we venture off into the next. We should make the most of the life given, to do his work, God's work. We aren't here to find Love, that is simply a privilege we are given.. a blessing.|`|Y60dqzCMaa	The reason we're here is to serve the will of our genes, which happen to act through the symphony of trillions of cells all playing their part to ensure your DNA is passed on.     On top of this abstraction, our conscious mind rests and lives in the world of humanity.     Regarding blackness - not so. When death has come, life is no more, and when life is here, death has not come. So notion of blackness or blah describes what we'll never know, since life and death are mutually exclusive. In that sense, we are entitled to a temporary eternity, which lasts forever until it's over :-).
pDKm9Wmgaa	Acrylics are the best thing to use for murals. I, too; would prime the wall with white primer first, then proceed with your painting. I would get vibrant colors, remembering that you might need more than you think.   Good luck and have fun.|`|TLzknS0eaa	Definitely acrylics because of the low off-gassing which is important for your place of business. If you want the colours to pop I'd suggest painting over the beige with a flat latex white or your colours will be muted by the beige.|`|YVNeeIIIaa	I use acrylic|`|X4Jm2nnhaa	Acrylic paints are your best bet.

RbmVnoozaa	when you put the capo on your guitar, the section that the capo doesn't vibrate is completely non existant when reading tabs. as in, that capo is officially the saddle of your fretboard.    for example, if you have the capo on the second fret, and it tells you to play a powerchord on the 1st fret, you play the powerchord on the 3rd fret if the capo wasnt there.|`|eZiOe9kFaa	YOUR CAPO BECOMES YOUR NUT.YOUR FIRST FRET IS THE ONE IN FRONT OF YOUR CAPO|`|EGIsUJy4aa	If your sheet music says to put your capo on, then it means that all notes and chords that you play are relative to the capo.  Doesn't matter if you put the capo on 2nd or 6th.  Wherever it is, THAT's your nut and you go from there.  The fret right after where you put your capo is then considered the 1st fret.  Hope this helps.  Happy playing :)|`|joA5Rcyzaa	the ones above are correct    it becomes the top of the fretboard|`|XOgvpDiZaa	The capo acts as the nut of the guitar, so every note or chord you play is played the exact same way and fret as if the capo wasn't there.
0BioKSmaaa	I think this is such a perfect poem   and haha i was just watching nip/tuck :P so i find it even more perfect  maybe just ONE change  instead of look inside the box (last line) you can put "too look outside the box" - that way it'll seem like you're referring to society and asking who is courageous enough to look outside of their boxed idea of what beauty is supposed to be and see all the different types of beauties in the world   as in   skinny doesn't always = beautiful   other that that  i think you've done a wonderful job   excellent work :D   i suggest you try to get this published (first time iv said that here on yahoo, i feel infected haha)   again   brilliant work :D

Everything is on the tip of my tongue,  and its spelling out your name,  something we both know inside out.

I dont know why but i feel like this poem is a kid asking his mother questions and asking why she's getting the abortion and wanting to get a chance in life, or not be blamed for being alive etc....mm...i think its an interesting write...  a few tweaking up here and there?   nice work tho :)|`|uW1ZlA2Haa	Touching

HP7ZSFQXaa	Lily.  Really sad to see you feel that way.  But, it is really very simple.  You are looking inwards.  And looking into yourself makes you small.  Makes your world small, makes your life small and meaningless.  You are not ungrateful.  You just don't know any better.  What else can one do for oneself besides eat, drink, sleep, and party?  Yes, it is VERY mundane.  And I feel sorry for you.    If you are really serious about changing this, then you will need to change your perspective.  Stop looking inwards and start looking OUT.  The more you give of yourself to everybody and everything around you, the BIGGER you will feel.  Trust me on this.  A simple illustration of what I am talking about is the change in elderly people living in retirement homes when they get a dog.  Before they get the dog, their lives are very mundane, wake up, eat, drink, take medicine, play bingo, sleep, do it again the next day.  The minute they own a dog, all of a sudden, it is not about them anymore.  They start looking outwards and caring about something else.  They give of themselves to their pet and, in return, they receive the unconditional love and affection a dog is known for.  The feeling of accomplishment and communion is a feeling that lasts a long long time - totally different from the temporary high of a party.    There are several ways to look outwards - plant a tree, adopt a pet, save the whales... but the one that provides more meaning is when you do charitable acts to another person.    Good luck.|`|FoIxsunVaa	If your soul is wrapped in plastic the world looks like prsaicus on ice.    Take off the wrapper and take her for a spin. Life can be cool in the fast lane.

That is incredibly exciting and never gets boring because you will be like a space traveller in a limitless ship. Use the LDK to achieve awakening to your own plan.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|40527ad60966d944ca757e8d6d1c6c28aa	Our societies are so structured so you're not wrong but how you feel is your choice.  You didn't choose to be born so it's not your fault you are here and you can certainly look at life as boring and mundane or you can keep doing stuff and getting involved to fill the gaps.  Pick some long term goals and find your satisfaction and interest in attaining those goals that you can focus on at any time or that make you want to be able to get back to working on again.

AA11120822	Because routine and tradition are comforting.|`|AA12079397	Normally it happens with everyone. Unless something awakes or interests us we continue the old thing as usual. One day I have discovered that this is happening because of spirits. A human being is a combination of several spirits. To start a new thing we must allow a new spirit to possess. But the old spirit never goes so easily. Therefore we naturally never cares the new things. If we have the awareness that these things are happening because of spirits then we may start little faster.

You are lucky you got a response at all.    Writers are charged with doing the research regarding various publishers, accepted genres, how to submit, etc. You obviously did not do that research.    Further: "Do you publish true story's?" screams "I have no clue what I'm doing." (The plural is: stories.)    Because people do not do the research, they send out these mass email bombs to any publisher for whom they can get an email address. Therefore, the publisher is up to his eyeballs in this nonsense, forced to wade through literally hundreds of irrelevant/silly/stupid emails each day, and undoubtedly sorry for making the email public.    A publisher does not go on about "the fact you suppose to write properly,it must be edited etc........ [sic]," which you obviously did not abide anyway. This is something every serious writer knows and should not have to be told. Publishers do not engage in Writing 101 for the WannaBe.    So, no, it is not rude. Again, you're lucky you got any sort of response at all, especially if your post here is indicative of the sort of communcation you sent the publisher.    Learn from the experience. If you want to know who publishes what, have a look at the Writers Market.

Not rude, really.     Aspiring authors should always do their homework. Asking if they publish true stories when they don't is like asking an unlicensed cafe to serve you a beer.    Read The Writer's Market to find out what publishers handle non-fiction, and what their criteria are; and stick to their guidelines. If you can do that, you *might* get somewhere.|`|0l98mcf3aa	Wake up and smell the coffee, garry.  If you want to be a writer, you have to be able to write. That's a basic understanding about the game. From the presentation of your question, you haven't got the hang of that yet.  There are a great number of publishers out there, and they specialise. So if you want to submit a manuscript, do some research to find out which publishers you need to approach. Hmm, this sounds like there's a bit of effort needed on your part, garry. Not such a good game any more, perhaps.  So when you contact a publisher to find out if they publish true stories, and this is not their field, they'll say no. And what sort of question was that? Did you specify in which field your non-fiction work is in? Is it something that publisher deals in? Do you know anything about the writing/publishing game? Give this some thought, garry.   If your written approach was anything like your question, I think they were extremely polite to you.|`|R0iHHPqEaa	what they said|`|pQGUPITeaa	I'm amazed they wrote back, which seems like a major achievement all on its own.|`|5XDf8voLaa	lol, truth hurts i know|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	Not rude at all.   That's the writing business for you.  And it isn't story's it's-stories.  So there's your first problem.    Publisher's don't care.   They have a job to do.  Get use to it if you want to get anywhere in the writing business.|`|AA10025824	You asked a question and got an answer.

Simple and to the point :) I kind of like it.
wYF6U6qlaa	Nice work, good practice! One suggestion I have is that when you use dialogue, try to always have a reason in your mind why that person is saying what they're saying. <br>  <br>  For example,<br>  <br>  "It’s Jason…” Mary said.<br>  “Yeah, Jason!” Jessica repeated.<br>  <br>  The purpose of Mary's words is to inform us.  Who are they talking about? Oh. Jason. Good. We learned something.  But "Yeah, Jason!" doesn't give us any more information.  Maybe if it was, <br>  "Yeah, Jason ..." Jessica repeated, her brow furrowed with worry. <br>  <br>  Then you'd be giving us a hint about how Jessica was feeling, or that the news was bad, or that Jessica is a character who tends to worry.  But as it is, there's a lot of 'extra' stuff in here that doesn't serve a purpose.  Of course, in real life, people say stuff all the time that doesn't serve a purpose.  That's why writing is a form of art - you have to pick and choose things that help build your story, and cut out the things that don't.  When you write, you should always try to make sure everything is in there for a reason.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|l4seJCEXaa	um... it could use alot of improvement...<br>  ask her-><a href="http://book-edit.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://book-edit.blogspot.com/</a><br>   she deals with this kinda stuff, i already tried it, shes really good, she gives great constuctive crtitisism|`|nhoxUrcdaa	OMG!, I so want to read the rest of this email me the rest  @ reneemichelle2008@gmail.com <br>  <br>  -Please and Thank You|`|9pRQ2EiTaa	I would :)<br>  Did you write this yourself?<br>  The resons i would read on, is to find out what the whole family secret is:P<br>  'I walked away, hearing Melissa quietly say something to him.

AA11712689	Ancient History is NOT the 1950/60's.  That is considered Modern History.  Ancient History is considered to be the point before the year 1 AD.    Nigerians and the country of Nigeria had the SAME technology in the 1950s and 60s that the rest of the world did.  Radios, television, cooking appliances like stoves, guns, even vehicles, etc.  A lot of Nigerians, however, didn't have the MONEY to purchase such items because it was a poorer nation than the US or England or France, for instance.  But there WERE people in Nigeria that DID have all of those items if they could afford them.  The items and technology WERE available to them just like the rest of the world.    Smaller, less expensive items like radios or guns were in abundance.    NIgeria gained independance from Great Britain in 1960, so they had ALL the technology England had.  They had a government, police departments, factories, machinery, famring equitment, politicians and doctors, teachers, bathrooms, modern houses, boats, trucks, planes, cars.    Check out the site below for some REAL photos in Nigeria in the 1950's.  http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal...    There is a picture of an airplane at the airport in Nigeria in 1950 in those pictures....and strangly enough, a photo of a toliet....with a crab in it too!|`|SLSX6QQsaa	They have and have always had SCAMMER technology.

Wi0LBsVbaa	It is only true in the verbal world. When we use words we a cutting the world up into boxes. The word being the box/symbol for the conceptual abstract we are pulling from the totality. Like the word hand creates the zone from your wrist to you fingertips, but this zone has no independent existence nad can be further subdivided into fingers and palms. etc.. as many part as you have words for.   The creation of a word for, and identifying a thing, as a thing, creates am entire category which is not the the thing, which stands as opposite it, in some form or another, by default.|`|jDsoVZK9aa	Actually everything has an opposite and an infinite number of positions between the two ends of that continuum.  Unfortunately most people only see the ends.  They suffer from an all too human disease called "Endism".  It is rarely curable.  But at least it does help make politics amusing.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Opposites are a mental construction. When you mean left and right and I mean left and returned, that is where all the confusion lies.

It is the way humanity understands but both opposites are required to make a whole.  A whole coin is heads and tails but it is not the opposite of anything when it is whole- then it just is a coin.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Polarity exists in terms of opposites, but as soon as you change the perspective it has become something else. The "opposite" exists simultaneously as the object in mind in compensation. It's too easy to just say I'm going to be good as opposed to bad, but how do you know where "you" are in those terms? I think that when you create positivity you also create negativity in compensation.     "Opposite" might not even be another object with the opposite qualities, but rather everything that isn't it. Everything in the universe that isn't this computer screen is the opposite of the computer screen. It's like how light works. When you see the green at the top of this page, every other color BUT green is reflected into your eyes.     It's a meeting point. Our bodies are the meeting point between physicality and consciousness. Between past and future. Between this or that.

If you want the romantic flair of the classic Holmes or such, than go with an old European city like Paris or Prague (might involve research, if you don't know the place).     If you like the classic, shady, comic book detective feel, than go for a run down industrial spot in a place like NYC and the like.     If you want something modern, it can really be open to you. Sometimes murder mysteries are inspired by true events,so you could look up murder stories in news archives and find one that's interesting to spark your ideas. (a lot of famous murder mysteries are taken off of serial killer cases like the Nightingale murders, Jack the Ripper, and the Pied Piper murderer).     Cities are more typical of a setting because the more people there are, the more possibilities. If you have one that takes place in the country, it's usually a story that circles around the culture of the place.|`|zkDVjptwaa	In the mountains|`|5iMja1Meaa	Somewhere ordinary is scarier because people can relate to it more and it makes it seem more real.

After all, he was a black man accused of raping a white woman. The fact that the case got to trial at all and he wasn't hanged straight away was a miracle. How did Atticus' intervention and the way he presented evidence convince you as the reader, the characters (the Ewells, the black people, the children, the white people) and the Judge of Tom's innocence or guilt? Was there any doubt at the end of the trial about who was telling the truth and who was lying?<br>  You don't say what level you're at, but you could also look into the implications of the Judge deciding that Mayella was lying. What would have this said to the community? Ooh, and you could also debate who was the lower class citizen of the community; Tom, who has a job and a family and pays his own way, but is a black man, or the Ewells, who are on the lowest rung of white society. But in this town, which is lower?|`|CqoTqEu6aa	well you should not use the word I in an essay ever...so you should not follow the suggestion of the girl below unless your teacher doesn't bother teaching you the proper format for essay writing. <br>  <br>  What did you find most interesting about the trial scene? find a point you found the neatest and then make that your thesis - what your essay is going to try to prove- for instance if a teacher asked you to write an essay about Jem your thesis could be " The character Jem of Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is the ultimate big brother figure' and then your essay you would provide three points to prove that i.e 1. he is always there for Scout when she needs him (give examples from the text) 2. he is a good role model for younger children like Dill and scout (again provide examples) and 3. he cares enough about Scout to risk his life to protect her. <br>  <br>  find the part of the court scene you found the most interesting and thing of something you can assert about it you could look at Atticus role as lawyer/ bodily defender, or the reactions of the townspeople to the trial. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped.

People: pedestrians on the street, people in cafes, children at play  landscape: buildings and their placement in the landscape  draw your daily routine  draw your dreams (surrealist much?)  study of an object from different angles, in different lighting conditions
MlZay5VHaa	You're plagiarizing Twilight! Your story is much too similar! STOP!!|`|0WKkXIyKaa	haahaha to monkey. that made me lol.    i like your story. if only twilight was 100 times short and as honest as this ;)|`|9Duha1k4aa	My name is Edward. Secretly, I possess a vagina which is why I waited for so long to have sex with Bella. Of course, Carlisle gave me a new willy operation so now I'm fully man. Bwuahaha! I sparkle in the sun. I think it makes me stunning. I'm the best at everything. I'm the cleverest in the world etc.  [ Yes, this is a dig at the number of times when he thinks that he is the best in the world. ]    My name is Carlisle. Does anyone else find it creepy that I only transformed teenagers (other than my hussy, Esme)?|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	You put Stephanie Meyer to shame.

Try to respect other peoples opinion, some people really like twilight!   How come otherwise it has become a bestseller?! Try acting more mature!|`|SygvUa0Eaa	... My sense of sarcasm has failed me somewhat. Please tell me this is a joke?    Oh... I see. Making fun of Twilight...    Kudos!|`|RF58XQqXaa	Amazing, though frankly I don't see how this makes fun of Twilgiht. But yes this would be ltotally movie worthy. Put Brad Pitt in it! XD~S|`|HF4ofA3Haa	Should this mess be linked with twilight somehow? I don't really get it.|`|FYT97XLgaa	Love it.|`|mb1CZfuEaa	oh very mature... how old are we now?|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	omg. that was exactly the same. you should so get published.|`|FbTZy0Yzaa	Just Hilarious.

I agree with the other person,     Thanks for the two points.|`|YY806Xn0aa	needs work.|`|vBwVheaXaa	If you say that you want people to read your story about Twilight then make it about Twilight and not be a total retard.    Your ruining it for people who want to read a story which is like Twilight.    Are you being sarcastic? because Stephenie Meyer won't be jealous because she will know that you have written something stupid like this to waste people's time.  She's a fantastic author who has actually published a story....oh yeah i can see you haven't.  You haven't got screaming fans who love what you wrote, you know what i think your the one who is jealous.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	....? this is stupid. thanks for the 2 points dude.|`|Es56v2Ohaa	LOL! sweet story!!!    it should totally become a series :DD|`|tmwa1oOiaa	I picture you being really hated in real life.|`|Y5dRN1BJaa	thank for the points|`|4Al9aapdaa	(roll eyes)|`|g6UJIAwraa	uhm yeah, Ayy Ess Ess H Oh Ell Eee.

38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Sorry, I tried searching it for you but came up with nothing pertinent.    Couldn't you just go back to B&N and check?|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. I don't know sorry. Peace
	I get distracted and bored alarmingly quickly, so I do it in pieces. If I force myself to do it in order I get bored and move onto something else.     I do the pieces that are most fresh in my mind, then have fun connecting the dots.|`|	Straight through.  Just a brainstorm being transferred to the keyboard. =]|`|	I write straight through, beginning to end. However, when I get ideas for different parts of the novel, I write it down in my notebook and come back to it when I'm ready for it. If you are intending to create a novel to be published, you should write the whole thing. Plus, writing it from beginning to end is more organized. Well, that's my opinion.    Hope this helped!|`|	I write the scenes that I feel like writing at the time, then when that's done I write the scenes that I'm not as enthusiastic about. (My scenes are usually entire chapters.)  Then I piece it all together, then I edit. Sometimes it happens to be in order, other times it's like the 17th chapter, then 2nd, then 5th, then 6th, and so on. That way I don't have to force anything and I can write what I want to. I keep a rough outline and check off what I've done/cancelled out, etc.|`|	Never write parts of a novel. Trust me- this will prove very confusing for you in the end. You never know which piece to put where, and then it's harder to make corrections because you never know HOW it'll fit. Writing it straightforward is much better, because this way you know how you're going to carry it on, and it's much easier to fix things that don't make sense. Also, it's easier to fit the puzzle pieces (my way of saying chapters, it just seems like this) together, because sequence is everything!    If you come up with ideas that can be used for a different part of the story, write it down on a different document/paper (whatever you use to write). This way you can always come back to it later, and add on to it with a fresh look.|`|	Bits and pieces and then I fit them together.  I usually start at the beginning, but sometimes one storyline calls to me and I work on that and then I develop another for a while.  It depends on how long the novel/story/play is.|`|	The most I have ever written, in order, is three chapters. I normally write a chapter and then get an Inspiration for a chapter earlier or later in the story. I write and then piece together.    Hope this helps!!|`|	It's impossible. You have to set up a plot and decide to work on characters before you plow through. That way everything isn't in chaos and you won't break down in a writer's block fit.|`|	I've written two novels which I self-published, and in both cases I wrote from beginning to end.  To me, that's the only method which makes sense; I did know what I meant to write, though, before beginning, but I did the actual writing without an outline.  I think that it might be confusing to write as you describe in your second sentence, yet the technique most likely would work if you should decide to do it that way.  There are no rigid rules for writing; whatever accomplishes your goal should be all right.  The objective is to create a complete novel; the means can be any type imaginable!  Good luck!|`|	Well, if you ask me, i do both. sometimes, i just write different parts, while other times i just write straight through. you are you and you should write the way you want to!
Jx1GDVF7aa	tuning tricks;<br>  1. tune the batter head a bit tighter/higher than the bottom head (the 2 different pitch oscilations cancel each other out & reduces over-ring)<br>  2. a bit of weather strip on the bottom head can further reduce over-ring<br>  3. single ply heads ring more than 2 ply,...|`|01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	I used to use 3" Paper towels with clear packing tape to muffle my drum heads years ago|`|AA12025213	Eh. I personally am not a fan of reducing overtone. If you HAVE to, I'd put a small square of duct tape with the middle pinched upward on the top head. <br>  <br>  If you want a natural way to reduce overtones, make sure that both the batter and the resonant head are tuned to the same pitch. This will help extremely as most of the ring you hear are the two different pitches clashing with one another, producing some sort of harmony. <br>  <br>  You will always get some overtone, but don't worry about it. You're the only one that can really hear it, the audience will not, and if you mic them right, they won't pick it up, either.|`|S4IvjacEaa	I have coated ambassadors, and they get a lot of overtone but I don't really mind it, you can't hear much of it anyway when your blasting music wearing iso headphones lol.|`|m9zviqlzaa	I use dampener rings on my drums. (also by remo) but I use my drums for worship in church, so I can't have to much overtone.|`|0pJAXEXCaa	lol.  I usually put a sock or something on the head.  It overmuffles it, but oh well.

w7USF5wDaa	Basically get as much writing and editing practice as you can and read everything you can get your hands on.  If your school has a paper or a literary journal get involved.  Take a creative writing class if there is one in your community.  Find out if you have a local writer's guild that will accept you as a member and go to meetings, they may have other resources that you could take advantage of, such as a mentorship program for younger writers.  Take extra english classes or advanced english classes if you can.  But, and I know you don't want to hear it, the most important thing is that you know basics, grammar for example, like the back of your hand.  You should know it well enough that it isn't easier to just dash off a note with poor grammar and lots of misspellings, it should be second nature to do it right.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|wtC4xtNEaa	Keep a journal/ notebook and spend some time each day writing down ideas in it. Also join some online sites that let you submit and re-view other people's work so that you get more experience. You can get involved with your school newspaper (if it has one,) and when you feel confident enough try entering some writing competitions.<br>  <br>  I've heard about...<br>  www.fictionpress.com <br>  <br>  I also used to use...<br>  www.allpoetry.com|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Take writing, journalism classes <br>  Also, write. Write down your thoughts, your ideas, your dreams.<br>  The more you write, the better you will get, and you will also have a better understanding of your strengths.|`|YorMkZYAaa	Easier to write in crap English than proper English when writing quickly...hmm. I don't buy it one damn bit.<br>  <br>  Save the excuses. If you want to be a writer or editor when you're an adult I suggest you drop the excuses and start writing. Both are demanding fields that are highly competitive and cutthroat. If you are naive enough to dismiss proper English even in a forum such as this you will not be taken seriously.
38J8nzhBaa	1) same principle:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_cam...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obsc...     It only seems that the pinhole actually uses film, while the other one was mainly for drawing.    2) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niepce  "He placed the sheet inside a camera obscura to capture the picture, and eight hours later removed it and washed it with lavender oil to remove the unexposed bitumen."    3)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography  "By 1840, Talbot had invented the calotype process, which creates negative images. John Herschel made many contributions to the new methods. He invented the cyanotype process, now familiar as the "blueprint". He was the first to use the terms "photography", "negative" and "positive". He discovered sodium thiosulphate solution to be a solvent of silver halides in 1819, and informed Talbot and Daguerre of his discovery in 1839 that it could be used to "fix" pictures and make them permanent. He made the first glass negative in late 1839."    4) a) yes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography  "The first permanent photograph was an image produced in 1825 by the French inventor Nicphore Nipce. However, because his photographs took so long to expose, he sought to find a new process. Working in conjunction with Louis Daguerre, they experimented with silver compounds based on a Johann Heinrich Schultz discovery in 1724 that a silver and chalk mixture darkens when exposed to light. Nipce died in 1833, but Daguerre continued the work, eventually culminating with the development of the daguerreotype in 1837"    b) See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreoty...   and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calotype      PS  ....in case your teacher also has Internet access: Don't just copy and paste. ;)
Mnm35sjNaa	Free will is the ability to make choices.  OF COURSE our choices are based on experience: that's what we have to work with.  There's no law declaring our options must be limitless.    Darwin's natural selection tells us that our greatest attribute (intelligence) is necessarily evolved to do what it does: make choices.  Human intelligence is NOT predetermined by some causal chain reaction set off by the Big Bang.  We are INFLUENCED by causality but not absolutely controlled by it.    In physics, causality rules the INANIMATE physical universe.  Until life came along (10 to 12 billion years after the big bang) the universe was entirely inanimate.  With life, matter gained motility: the ability to move about WITHOUT outside influence.  Motility is one obvious difference between animate and inanimate matter.    Many animals, particularly mammals, appear to possess consciousness -- if not intelligence.  Certainly, humans possess both.  The introduction of consciousness wrought another milestone in the history of the universe -- and only animals possess it.    I would define intelligence as the ability to anticipate, plan for, and use causality for independent reasons.  Human intelligence certainly fits that bill.  Human intelligence is the latest milestone in the evolution of life.  This milestone came about in just the last 1 or 2 hundred thousand years: a mere drop in the bucket of cosmic time.  We are on the cusp of an evolutionary revolution that is accelerating at breakneck speed.    The first phase of universal history -- the Inanimate Phase -- lasted 10 to 12 billion years.  The second phase -- the Animate Phase -- has been around for 3.5 billion years.  The most recent phase -- the Human Phase -- has only existed for a hundred thousand years or two.  The duration of these phases are shrinking exponentially.  The next phase might well involve the combination of human intelligence with artificial intelligence.  Who knows?    But one thing's for sure: we ALL live, work, play and plan as if we have free will.  "Hard" determinists might claim that's an illusion.  I claim they can't see the forests for the trees.  Yes, causality is an undeniable fact of physical existence.  However, its absolute realm is the INANIMATE, physical, universe.  For instance, if I hit a billiard ball on the right side, it will veer left every time.  If I hit a worm on the right side, it might coil into a writhing knot or wiggle to the right or accelerate forward or whatever.  Clearly, ANIMATE BEINGS react to causality differently than INANIMATE THINGS.    Human intelligence is another example of why animate beings can't be treated as if they're the same inanimate stuff as the rest of the universe.  If you read the recent neuroscientific literature, you'll find the human brain has many feedback mechanisms performing various functions.  There's at least one feedback mechanism that grants us the power of mind over matter (brain).  This feedback mechanism is reliably demonstrated by the "bio-feedback machine".  With this machine, just a few physiological readouts of subconscious processes allow us to control those processes with a little practice.    Mental feedback is the key to free will.  It seems incredible but we are able -- via mental feedback -- to direct the very brain that spawns our consciousness.  This is a powerful fact because it allows us to counter the inexorable tide of causality.    My favorite example of this is the 1969 manned mission to the moon.  Hard determinists who say that our actions and fate are predetermined by causality, are claiming that all the coordination, cooperation, resources and effort it took to put man on the moon was inevitable and scripted ever since the Big Bang.  If youre a determinist, then you believe all the details involved with putting man on the moon were predetermined billions of years ago.  With a script so precise and mystical, you might as well say God wrote it.    Yeah, right . . . May the the force be with you.    The "compatibilist" view that free will coexists with causality goes much further than determinism to explain our special role in the universe: including our achievements, failures and limitations.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Interesting, no, but does it exist? Also no.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	Determinism, like solipsism, is incapable of refutation but also of the slightest conviction.  Against it, you have not only the experience of conscious choice but also of every willed action you take.  For example, if you are in a bank and armed robbers enter and tell everyone to line up by the wall, and you do so, you do not feel that some puppeteer is moving you there - it is your own willed movement.    You seem to think that being limited beings does away with our idea of freedom.  But any free choice needs a framework of alternatives that it can be exercised in.  You want not freedom but OMNIPOTENCE - a difficult concept even for God.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Free will totally exists, just as much as fate does. Why this whole topic is so confusing is because our "thoughts" think that they are the ones choosing. Thought believes whatever is convenient. Thought is unique to every human (that uses language anyways). The "you" and the "me" are insubstantial in terms of our human life's story. Fate and free will happen uniquely for every moment that exists. As time will arrange it, it will adapt every single moment as a compensation for the last.    The world is all too real, but "we" aren't as much as thought likes to think.|`|OoihsiN0aa	Very true. Im writing an essay about Fate and what not and if free will has any control over fate.  I think fate is fate and everything is planned out and even when you think you taking a different road or doing something that u wouldn't normally do is really all a part of your original plan.  I agree with you and now that i think of it i think your absolutely right|`|spYpsixUaa	Wrong-o!  As long as you designate decision-making to an illusion, you will always conclude (incorrectly) that Free Will does not exist.    As you finish recovering from that dissing, you will again conclude incorrectly that Free Will does not exist when you limit our self-professed illusory choices to erroneous fake and (expletive deleted) values, and Christian Salvation.  Gee, it's kinda like having an assassin point a gun at my head and demand that I either tell him where the Gold is hidden or be liberated from these mortal coils in a very messy manner.  Gee, it's so liberating. (Not!)    Think about these issues with your logic, and then come back and ask again when you have re-tooled your thoughts with these contradictions amended.  You might also try to be a little less judgmental of your non-Christian reality.|`|6PQOjBrYaa	Look ,you are talking about two separate entities. Free will is,say in england , the option to move to New Zealand or alternatively ,move up to scotland and breed beavers. The so called and completely misunderstood term :Anarchy, is a prime example for societies being paranoid of free will. is it a village or a whole country that fights for a free will. is it lifestyle or simply common sense that is free will?  On the other hand you have the  divine concept of fate. Destiny so to speak . Did you know that even the old norse gods had to revert to trickery, to learn their own fates, by tricking fate itself into revealing it.  Fate is older and beyond the powers of the norse gods.  Every time you make a decision you encounter a crossroad. Are you going to go left or right? Each path will take you along towards new crossroads. Gypsies tell that your path is already to be read in your hand. Do what i do and enjoy every little bit there is to the most. Stop looking for proofs. There is no proof . Only your intuition. Travel well|`|HJI8778baa	Interesting question. It all comes down to control. You can be led into something without your choice, but at that point your conscious consideration of it being either right, or wrong and whether you want to continue it, or not is the freewill imposed on us all.|`|d265DZbHaa	If god exists then free will is an illusion    If god does not exist then there is free will.    This is because free will is the knowledge of how to over ride the determining and limiting aspects of nature. If there is a god and he knows everything about past, present and future then there is no override. However because there is no god or other supernatural force then we can learn to change our futures.    By the way it has been proven that fate - luck - and all that does not exist. look it up.|`|MPtt9wPjaa	free-will.. the ability to make your own choices right?  well.. God has given us intellect, that's what separates us from animals. The ability to intellectually understand and act. When you say a song you listen to is sort of a reflection of your experiences, werent those experiences the result of your choices? no matter what happens to you, it happens BECAUSE of you.. "az mast ki barmast"(a line from a Farsi poem).  so yea.. i would say more like.. were given intellect.. free-will has never been one of my preferred choice of words.  and we are therefore, NOT limited beings. maybe for materialistic things.. things that dont matter.. things which in your words are "us being brainwashed by this worlds fake and shitty values and morals" things like flying or something. useless things.  i dont know if that makes sense.. its one of those topics where i have so many thoughts its hard to put into words. but i hope you get it :)  p.s. it's wonderful that you wonder :)|`|jDsoVZK9aa	Which "exist" are you talking about?  If you mean does it exist as an object, the answer is NO.  If you mean as a concept, whether valid or not, the answer is YES.    If you mean is it a verifiable process that can be scientifically shown, the answer so far is NO.  If you mean is it a belief shared by many people, the answer is YES.      As for God there is no necessary relationship.  You could have, in theory, Free will with or without a God.  You could have, in theory, a God with or without Free will.  They are independent except by belief that they are not.      And God, again, no one has ever been able to prove or verify that any God has ever existed.  Of course, like Free will you can believe God exists.  But you might have some problems explaining why beyond your belief or a social need to conform to what others might appear to want you to believe.    I personally find the concept of Free Will to be a totally flawed concept, but then I also consider its opposite, "determinism", to be fatally flawed.  We need a whole new way to understand ourself that leaves ideas that grew out of the ignorance of the medieval religious mind behind.
09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	Since the dream is crucial to the story which follows, I think that you must write it to make that impression.  Describe it as the girl experiences it.  You can make it vague originally, then, as the plot progresses during the interlude before she moves to Florida, have the dream become more vivid and complex, increasingly realistic.  You can have her first dismiss it, but, as the dream continues to haunt her nightly, have her become more and more concerned and, perhaps, confused.  Do you want her to feel compassion for those in the dream, or do you want her to fear them?  In your post the characters on the beach do not seem menacing, so you might want Natalie to be intrigued by the dream rather than frightened or worried.  I do think that definitely you must make the dream sequence compelling because it is the point from which the plot manifests.  I hope that the preceding is helpful to you; good luck with your writing...
X4Jm2nnhaa	That is an interesting pic, I like how the light areas are "blown out"-which gives the image a 2-D contrast. The way you placed yourself is dynamic, being in the right third of the frame of reference and I'm glad you cannot see your hand holding a camera as that would remind me of the typical myspace bathroom shot. The pattern in the background is the most intriguing part of the image for me and to tell the truth you don't seem to look that disturbed or tortured. Maybe more dramatic lighting would help purvey that emotion.|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	It's overexposed. And it's a little out of focus. Can't really say I liked the composition either.     I am afraid I don't feel what you were trying to convey. This looks like a typical Myspace pose.     p.s. You should get that mole looked at by a dermatologist.|`|UiQ6V377aa	Looks like you are going to get a bunch of perverts look at you naked....

k8AcVixTaa	I like the photo.  The only issue I see is focus and contrast.  I would try to sharpen the image up or do selective sharpening on the face and let the rest go out of focus.  I'm a big believer in better contrast if you are going to do BW.  Bump up the contrast a little or even a lot.  Experiment with the contrast.  This would make an excellent film photography.    Visually it is very disturbing and very well done.  I like it a lot.  Definitely better than most of the dregs posted here by people with low self-esteem or complete Narcissists|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	I think this photograph belongs in a psychiatrist file.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	I like the picture... but the focus is a little soft  Love your idealism... would like to shoot photos of you TFCD|`|aNlT1NRqaa	The picture is too soft/shaky, and I think the leg positioning is a little awkward (maybe knees together, knees angled up-frame, would have made it look less jumbled).    I do like the idea, and the picture is pretty good.|`|k7MINvaIaa	Honest criticism usually is met with thumbs down, but here it goes.    The composition is interesting, but only because of the angle from which you took the photo. Exposure is good and the soft focus is also acceptable given the effect I assume you desire.

And mind you, lots of things are very mildly radioactive.  It occurred to me that these things had always been this way... but it was only now that I was becoming aware of it.  It was like having a whole new sense; like seeing for the first time a world that had been there all along but of which I had been largely ignorant.<br>  <br>  I'll think about people who lack a sense that many of us take for granted.  They cannot see, cannot hear, or perhaps they lack the kinesthetic sense that tells them where their limbs are so they have to watch their feet when they walk or they fall over (this happens, actually).  When I muse about such things it makes me want to experience the worlds I do have access to all the more.  To know and understand it all.<br>  <br>  And then I'll think about what other worlds are out there.  Things I don't have a geiger counter for.  Perhaps things that nobody does.  There could be whole universes lying next to our own.  Maybe that's where gods live.  Or maybe there are worlds invisible even to the Divine.  How would even a god know if there's something just as invisible to it?  Sometimes the weight of everything I can't see presses in on me like I'm in a Lovecraft story, so it seems like I might be crushed by whole worlds at any moment and nobody would be any wiser about what happened or where I had gone.  Sometimes I worry about making a right turn from reality and ending up someplace entirely different and never able to return, like an episode of the Twilight Zone or something.<br>  <br>  It's a lot to think about, sometimes.|`|2WnbP80Taa	how to become a good philosopher|`|1471ToHraa	I think that you can't really decide what's deep or not. For example even knowing where life came from wouldn't be useful if you knew the answer.<br>  <br>  Here is one, I believe that humans although in denial behave very much like parasites, we destroy each other through war, scavenge and drain all resources from our Host, the planet earth. And reproduce like there's no tommorrow<br>  <br>  Then the idea here is to embrace our nature as parasites and find a way to devour other planets. That is why we should focus on space technology. However, since we are in denial, we focus instead on health care and war and entertainment instead.|`|AA11219693	I hope that you are not just expecting something new and exciting, as I have nothing of the sort in to share with you in response to your question, but I can assure you that there is something that far excels in its intrigue and fascination in the minds, in the minds of the ones who pause for a moment or two every now and then, and care to pay attention, the ones who can think between thoughts. <br>  <br>  The things I have in my mind in fact is so fundamental and essential to life that we oft times fail to even notice, that it is there – how many times over the last one year or two have you wondered about the air you breathe, for instance, or about the beating of you heart, about the working of your mind, the origin of your thoughts, or about the source of your desires and origin of life? You might as well have given a these questions a thought or two sometimes, but have you ever wondered about the one who could be asking these questions, who is you?<br>  <br>  The greatest of all questions, and perhaps the purest in entire philosophy, is I think the question of the self – as, who am I? I know that you could tell take me by storm informing about yourself as a person, but could you tell yourself. <br>  <br>  The question gets my head buzzing with pure sense of wonder, leaving no room even for excitement. Whenever I think too deeply about the world, I end up thinking about the self that I eventually am, and whenever I think too fervently about my self, I come to think of Almighty God, but the question that interests me most is, who in the middle I really am? This I believe would be the best think for me, and for anyone, to know in this world.|`|AA12231462	Up to when I was fourteen I lived in a dissociated state mostly in stories day dreams and just "away''.

1l69CCScaa	Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the true, or potential, nature of reality and the mind.  I believe meta is Greek for "beyond" or "above" so it makes sense; "beyond-physics."  There are many theories within the field of metaphysics and most major philosophers touch on some of them in some way or another.  For example, David Hume demonstrated how our concept of cause and effect is not nearly as concrete as we often believe.    Importantly, speculation as to whether or not a god exists falls into this field.  Although aspects of a god, such as morality, may fall into ethics, the true question of Whether god(s) exist and, if so, How? fall under the umbrella of metaphysics.      Another major topic within the field is the mind body problem.  Essentially, "is the mind separate from the body?"  Don't be too hasty to answer, there are many arguments surrounding this idea that should not be ignored.|`|OoihsiN0aa	I dont think it actually has a real meaning.

There are a ton of noodles from Asia which are different from the Italian ones, Germany has spaetzle, etc. Certain cheeses are associated with different countries too, like queso fresco with Mexico, Parmesan with Italy, Feta with Greece, lots with France and America.    Or like how similar foods show up in very different cultures. Egg/spring rolls from Asian countries, burritos from Mexico, calzone from Italy, Cornish pasties from England, etc.    You could represent them any way you wanted really, from sculpting, to painting, to photography.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	If I'm recalling correctly, MacIntyre's primary problem with Rawls is that he never really sets down what it is that people should be trying to do.  Everyone is free to pursue their own ends and Rawls is trying to make sure that they can, whatever those ends happen to be.  But leaving things so open-ended seems to smack to MacIntyre as a kind of moral relativism - if everyone can do anything they want (more or less), it would seem that nothing is wrong and nothing is right.  There is no direction and the result by his estimation is chaos.<br>  <br>  Whether you agree with one or another will probably depend a lot on what you think of human nature, which is itself a rather open question.<br>  <br>  If you tend to think (as Rawls did) that people have a social instinct and general respect for one another and a desire and an ability to make their own way, then you'll want a really flexible meta-ethical system that doesn't create a lot of hard rules and allows a lot of flexibility and diversity of goals and viewpoints.  On the other hand, if you tend to think (as MacInyre) that people can never accidentally behave well and need very definitive guidance in order to have a good life, even by themselves, then you're going to want a social system that creates that kind of structure for people to navigate in.<br>  <br>  My take, for what it's worth.  Hope that helps!
y8bFwXZEaa	"A conception of the good includes "a conception of what is valuable in human life." Normally it consists "of a more or less determinate scheme of final ends, that is, ends [goals] that we want to realize for their own sake, as well as attachments to other persons and loyalties to various groups and associations." <a href="http://www.wku.edu/~jan.garrett/ethics/matrawls.htm#jrint" rel="nofollow">http://www.wku.edu/~jan.garrett/ethics/m...</a><br>  <br>  "These parties...are neither naturally altruistic nor purely egoistic: they have ends they seek to advance, but desire to advance them through cooperation with others on mutually acceptable terms."  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of...</a><br>  <br>  If this is what Rawls believes, he is wrong, because egoism desires its own ends but not with harm to others. This is what is meant by "mutually acceptable terms," but Rawls assumes egoism desires nothing but its own ends at any cost. Dismissing egoism in the belief that such terms will replace them means the principles of egoism must be left at the door. Leaving one's egoism at the door leaves only the altruism he says is not natural.<br>  <br>  "Altruism is the opposite of egoism." <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/egoism.htm#SH2a" rel="nofollow">http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/egoism.htm#SH2a</a><br>  <br>  No one is going to accept Rawls based on altruism, and to forego one's ego (in the form of egoism) is altruistic.<br>  <br>  "In philosophy, egoism is the theory that one’s self is, or should be, the motivation and the goal of one’s own action.<br>  "The normative variant proposes that people should be so motivated, regardless of what presently motivates their behavior."<br>  The "normative variant" is what Rawls is counting on.<br>  "The descriptive (or positive) variant conceives egoism as a factual description of human affairs. That is, people are motivated by their own interests and desires, and they cannot be described otherwise.<br>  In this version, "not only is it rational to pursue one’s own interests, it is irrational not to pursue them. In a weaker version, one may note that while it is rational to pursue one’s own interests, there may be occasions when not pursuing them is not necessarily irrational."<br>  <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/egoism.htm#SH2a" rel="nofollow">http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/egoism.htm#SH2a</a><br>  <br>  Progressives such as Obama have studied Rawls thoroughly and they act politically as if all American's ought to follow Rawl's methods.<br>  <br>  But most people actually act on the descriptive variant of egoism, or they are merely egotistical. Either way, it is dividing this nation, and rather than bringing us closer together, as it was predicted Obama could do, he will merely split us between the "variants" more profoundly than any single person so far in our history.<br>  <br>  Our next presidential campaign will either attempt to swing the pendulum back the other way; or Obama will win again, after which I think the "John Galt" effect will kick into high gear.<br>  <br>  It really is beginning right now. It is being reported that people are quitting.|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	If I'm understanding your question correctly, it doesn't seem to be that difficult to do so, if we stick to the way Rawls tends to use those terms.<br>  <br>  In section 15 of "A Theory of Justice", for example, he states rather simply that "good is the satisfaction of rational desire."  He tends also to expand his use of 'good' to things which allow this kind of satisfaction:  freedom, health, opportunity, and so on.<br>  <br>  The justice that he considered in much of the rest of the work deals with the distribution of those goods.  Or, as it's often summarized, "justice is fairness".  When everyone can apply for a job and be given the same consideration, that's fair.  It doesn't mean that everyone has to actually get it - just that anyone can reasonably try.<br>  <br>  I suppose there might be some blurring of the two if you start to think of fairness itself as a good.  But this seems to be a bit of a non-sequitur to me... it's possible for your neighbor to be healthier than you (or to have access to better doctors than you), but it starts to require a bit of linguistic convolution for him to have more fairness than you.  The justice (a.k.a. fairness) is BETWEEN you.<br>  <br>  My take, for what it's worth.|`|1471ToHraa	While I doubt you'll find a useful answer on Yahoo Answers...<br>  <br>  I believe that fairness as Justice can be distinguished between Good. Good as itself is simply too vague and wide a term to have any real meaning to everyone, even to most people the concept of Good itself will have minor to major differences.<br>  <br>  Justice and Fairness though can be made through social contracts, social pressure. It is ultimately up to the people to decide and agree if things are fair or just.

OhWmu0R3aa	Despite what you might hear there were no violations of rights.    During part of the Seven Years War that took place in America (known as the French and Indian War in the US) the colonists were desperate for British military protection to prevent a French take-over. When the French were successfully defeated and the threat of future invasions temporarily lifted, the problems began.     The British troops stationed in America to prevent further attacks on the colonies were not paid enough to cover their expenses, of which housing was one. There were not enough barracks to cover all regiments and the colonists outright refused to provide any (had this request been put forward during the war, the answer may have been quite different). So, to supplement their army pay, British soldiers took jobs in the local private sector. This led to direct competition with the colonists for jobs, who often lost out to the soldiers who were prepared to work for less money and usually longer hours if the job involved manual labour to which they were suited. This angered many colonists such as Sam Adams and they decided these troops had to go. By force if necessary.    Parliament heard of the situation and decided that since one set of Englishmen (as the colonists were regarded) were refusing to provide shelter for another, they passed the Quartering Act that decided troops would be housed in VACANT buildings, UNUSED warehouses and barns, and in extremis local taverns to which the landlord would be paid from the Crown purse. No troops were EVER quartered in private houses or forced families from their homes, but again the great propagandist Sam Adams, in an effort to enflame opinion against the British, constantly spread word that scores of Boston families had been forced to accomodate British soldiers in their own homes and were being evicted  He did a brilliant job, as over 200 years later this is the version that is still believed.|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	provide room and board to the British Soldiers.

k4DxnbMCaa	To start your paper, think up a solid thesis. The thesis will outline what the rest of your paper is about. In middle/high school, papers typically have 5 paragraphs: 1 introduction (containing your thesis and argument), 3 body paragraphs (each of them giving proof of or strengthening your argument) and 1 conclusion (containing your initial argument and closing statement). Make sure you don't abbreviate words without first telling the reader what you're abbreviating. For example, ensure that you say "The United States of America (USA)" before you start to use "USA" in your paper. Also, use "should not" instead of "shouldn't", cannot instead of "can't", and so on. This will make your paper more formal. These are only a few pointers to help you get started.

NYU37jfGaa	Meat might be cooked in a cauldron over an open fire, or baked either over a fire in a clay casserole or in a partly covered cooker made of hard clay.  Bread would also be baked in a clay oven.  Grills were popular and used for small items such as sausages or chops p these grills were set low on the ground, with a fire beneath, and were made of baked clay.  Olive oil was stored in large pottery jars called amphorae.      Metal equipment was necessary for poking fires, hooking out meat, and other purposes. These were made of bronze and later, of iron.  Knives and cleavers were in every kitchen, and useful pots, bowls, and mortars, which would usually be made of terracotta.
ZaFreVDhaa	Check out www.doverpublications.com  they have a reprint of an old, beautifully illustrated book called the "atlas of anatomy for artists". it's my favorite book and invaluable. (the original was from the 19th century, I think. it covers everything from skeletons, to muscles, drawings of split people, (skin half on half off.) Theres a cool picture of a head where you see head, skull and brain at the same time. Most of the whole figures are in poses, not just standing there.    Check out their other anatomy books too. They are awesome and nothing like modern books. Artists who were classically trained back then were expected to know this stuff.

JZCbAR4Yaa	I liked it more. There was none of the Bella and Edward drama of being hopelessly in love with each other. I didn't really liked them and how self-obsessed they were.    But the Host is a lot different. It's got romance but it doesn't overshadow the whole plot of the story like it did in Twilight.  It's an interesting entertaining read and I enjoyed it.   The characters are more human than in Twilight and they just felt a whole lot more real to me. And I don't mean that in a way like there were Vampires and Werewolves. Everyone just felt too perfect. The Host has more human emotions and less perfection in people.|`|Q1LXnEcNaa	it depends because i normally dont like to read books unless they interest me like twilight, and stephanie meyer wrote the host so im sure its still very good. give it a try and see if you like it.|`|42OXwp7Uaa	The Host is loads better than Twilight.

It's actually got a real plot and some character development. Do not be deterred by people that say it's difficult to understand. The beginning of the book is SUPPOSED to be. The things that happen in the beginning are explained later, which I actually thought was pretty interesting. It still suffers from some horribly cheesy romantic garble, but it's a good read.|`|S1dwqmwAaa	The host is good but it's for adults. I read it and im 13 i didn't really understand it. When i finally did i was blown away.

fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing  at affordable costs.    The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.    Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.    Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose books are of the highest quality, bar none.    Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their books top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.    Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your books production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.     Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.    You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.

It means 'body of Christ' and is the name of a festival of the Catholic Church that takes place in June.  In medieval times it was a very big festival (it still is in some Catholic countries, like Spain).    The Mystery plays were performed to coincide with religious festivals, one of which was Corpus christi.|`|GClXFKp1aa	the Medieval period. The plays were all  religious ones, so it was natural for a religious group of actors to perform them. What could be better than priests? The church first performed the plays, but later they stopped. When the plays were no longer performed by the church, guilds put on the plays that went with their trades. For example, "Noahs Ark" was performed by the shipbuilders, and "Jonah" by the fishmongers.    . No women acted, so men played womens parts. The stages on which the medieval actors played could be moveable or stationary, but both  were highly in use. One way of presenting the innumerable small scenes was called static. The scenes were arranged in a semi-circle, with the audience in front of them. There was  also an early version of theatre-in-the-round, with the scenes grouped around a central area, and the audience on raised tiers around that. Sometimes the scenes were even mounted  onto carts which paraded through town. Since the plays were all religious ones, they were called  the Corpus Christi plays. Corpus Christi means "writings about Christ" . Some sources say that the wagons were very cumbersome, being two-staged. The upper stage was used for the performance, while the lower stage served as a dressing room

pI5jKfmaaa	Giuseppe Garibaldi<br>   He was born in Nizza on July 4th, 1807. Since he was a boy he proved to be full of courage. When he was eight he saved a woman who had fallen into a ditch and when he was thirteen avoided the shipwreck of some companions. He had a predilection for physical exercises and sea life. When he was fifteen he embarked as ship-boy. In 1832 he became master. On the occasion of his voyages he knew some Giovine Italia's representatives and become patriot in a short time. <br>  <br>  The following year he met Giuseppe Mazzini and became available for a revolutionary action. The deed failed and Garibaldi was obliged to take refuge in Marsiglia in a false name. Afterwards he left to South America where he lived for 12 years. During this period Garibaldi tried to embark on the commercial enterprise but his business was slack and his bellicose and political temper overwhelmed him so that he decided to embrace the South America republicans' cause. He fought in Brasil, Argentina and Uruguay. <br>  <br>  In Montevideo, the capital of this last Country, he met Anita (Anna Maria Ribeiro da Silva) and he married her on March 16th,1842. Anita and Garibaldi had three children: Menotti (so named in memory of the homonymous patriot from Modena, Teresita and Ricciotti. Garibaldi's enterprises in America became so famous as inflame italian patriot's hearts and deserve the appellative of "heroe of the two Worlds". <br>  <br>  He returned to Italy in order to reorganize the rebellions for the unification of the peninsula. He was at the head of several troops and he was designated general of some garrisons but the short organization, the lack of weapons and equipments did not give any good result. For such a reason Garibaldi was obliged to go into exile again and return to America. The distance from his native country did not make Garibaldi to forget politics and the republican spirit. <br>  <br>  As he come back to Italy he reorganized the revolutionary action together with other patriots. After several colloquies with Cavour and the king Vittorio Emanuele he was at the head of a guard with the rank of general. In such a way started the military campaign against Austrians which concluded with the armistice of Villafranca. Afterwards Garibaldi, who was longing for action, resigned from the rank of general and removed to the central Italy in order to support the insurrectional governments. When Sicily, since 1859, showed a certain revolutionary excitement Garibaldi was invited from the Partito d'Azione and from Giuseppe Mazzini himself, to organize a military expedition. Garibaldi accepted and, after having procured a few weapons, sailed to Sicily with 1089 volunteers, who embarked on the steamers Piemonte and Lombardo. It was at dawn, on May, 6th, 1860. After a short, necessary, stop at Talamone, for the supply of weapons, Garibaldi went on docked at {CLICK HERE - FOR THE LIST OF VOLUNTEERS WHO LANDED AT MARSALA} <br>  <br>  On May, 11th, Garibaldi docked at Marsala harbour without being disturbed by Bourbon that did not want to open fire because they did not want to hit the english watercrafts which were moored at the quayside. After having gathered volunteers in Marsala and delivered speeches (in this town the Heroe pronounced the famous sentence: "Rome or Death") he left again towards Salemi where he designated himself Dictator, in the king Vittorio Emanuele's name. Then he went on towards Calatafimi where he found the Bourbon defence. <br>  <br>  It was a bloody and unequal battle because Garibaldi relied on 1200 men against 2000 Bourbons. The fate of the encounter turned in Garibaldi's favour who conquered, with his volunteers, the position at the bayonet. Although Garibaldi had an exiguous number of volunteers at his disposal in comparison with the Bourbon forces, his tactical intelligence and his courage made him to conquer all Sicily, to cross the Straits of Messina and to go on towards Naples. The battle at Volturno was very hard so as it was bloody the attempt to conquer the fortress of Capua and Gaeta. Meanwhile the Bourbon King Ferdinando II left Naples and Giorgio Pallavicino was designated prodictator. <br>  <br>  The plebiscite was appointed on October, 21st and also took place in Sicily at the same time. Afterwards the two regions were joined to Vittorio Emanuele's reign. The king, who met Garibaldi at Teano, was greeted by the heroe as king of Italy. Garibaldi's life continued with politics and the work of reunification of italy. He organized military compaignes against Austrians that gave good results until the armistice was signed. <br>  <br>  After the last military actions he continued doing politics. Then he retired into private life in the island of Caprera where he died in the evening, on June, 2nd, 1882 and where he is still buried.|`|KADDz1EPaa	General Garibaldi was nicknamed the hero of two worlds, so valiantly fought in South America and in Italy, commanding the famous red shirts: the Garibaldini

G4iHDhpvaa	Well it's a good idea, in fact I love it.The only problem is that in your prologue you say "I sit" in the present tense then "Sitting there" past tense, It should be "Sitting here" or "I sat". Other than that I love it, and it sounds like my kind of book, I would definitely read it.|`|cwzH7DVvaa	I don't like it; in fact I'd actually set out to dislike it because you mispelt prologue. (Sorry, spelling Nazi.) The main problem is it's far too rushed. There's no hance to empathise or care about the characters because we're thrust into this situation. Another thing that annoyed me was the description in this piece. They're far too overdone and cliched. 'crystal blue eyes' for example, has been overused to death. For your writing to seem fresh and original, you need to make it unique and completely yours. Slow down a bit; figure out your characters and who they are. A prologue draws the reader in but doesn't have to shove everything down their throat. Stick with abstractness and mystery for your prologue, it should work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -Sarah|`|l4seJCEXaa	send it there-> <a href="http://book-edit.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://book-edit.blogspot.com/</a><br>  shell help u
4wU1rCUfaa	My suggestion to you would be that you watch movies with Americans in them. Study the way they pronounce their "r's" and how staccato their patterns of speech. If you have ever tried studying IPA, that usually helps as well. It's a lot if some of your English comes in when you're speaking, don't stress on pronouncing every word exactly because the point of an accent is to make it flow and sound natural. <br>  Hope that helps!|`|1yo2sJ62aa	I don't really know how to advise you on how to do an American accent, but here goes. <br>  Watch an American film(or TV Show), one you like. Try to learn some of the lines along with it-then speak them along with the Actresses or Actors, who will be speaking in an American Accent.Try and mimic them as much as possible, try to say the words like they do. <br>  You could simply practice and hope it works. If you like music by American singers, you could sing along to them. If I do that, I tend to somehow get an American accent when singing despite the fact I can't speak in an American Accent.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this will help, but I hope it does, and I hope you manage to  talk in an American Accent! And Good Luck with the performance! Break a leg!|`|Cv0JyCYlaa	hey martha , well there are many possibilities but these are my tips try to do an american accent by L<br>  1) watching american tv programmes - just try and repeat what they say in an american accent it'll be easy trust me.<br>  2) go on internet websites there's lots of information and help you can do to get a perfect american accent just go on google :)<br>  3)if those two dont work , try getting a proffesional coach specialising in american accents , you'll soon get the hang of it :)<br>  4) practise your vowels this website will help will the occasional words that slip out >><a href="http://www.americanaccent.com/pronunciation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanaccent.com/pronunciat...</a><br>  5) practise , practise , practise - try practising everyday at home ( practice makes perfect) espically the lines you'll get taught to do.<br>  <br>  thanks :)<br>  and good luck.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	Find a famous actor or actress with an American accent you like and watch a film with them in and really focus on the accent.  Try mimicing it as you're watching it and then carrying on with it afterwards and you should get it eventually, even if you have to watch the film or TV show over and over.<br>  I usually practice my accents in the car on the way to rehearsals.|`|zBpj9jCfaa	Well, because I am American, I really have no idea what our accent sounds like to others, but I would just suggest watching American movies, tv shows, recordings, etc. When I visited England for three weeks, my own speech began to alter because of the fact that I was constantly around a different accent. So if you just surround yourself with the American accent, you will pick it up more easily and it will begin to feel more natural.|`|BzMQejGxaa	I get those problems. American accents are different- southern is different from New York.<br>  <br>  Try to say the alphabet how an American would say it. Once you get the sounds or the vowels, you're okay.

iNqOsh1Naa	The hat represents several things throughout the film: death (in its loss at the moment when he is about to be shot for not offing Bernie), desire (when Verna gets hold of it and by doing so gets Tom to her apartment), and departure (as when Tom puts on his hat to break from his old world and leave--putting on your hat is always a signal of departure.) Personally I think the other commentators are off base. Miller's Crossing is, as you seem to agree, a brilliant film, with some of the best dialogue ever penned (in my humble opinion). What's the rumpus? What a line!|`|UDEMDcGuaa	I always thought it represented rationality and keeping your head rather than acting out of violent emotions, Tom Reagan is the voice of reason in the film and he dreams of losing it and dying or being lost.  Of course step by step matching of the symbol to that is probably a waste of time and as the other poster said the hat blowing through the woods is also a cool image that they liked to show.<br>  <br>  I also think it was brilliant movie, the scene with burning house, the tommy gun with Danny Boy playing in the background is wonderful|`|hQ95u9OLaa	You know I don't really think that was the Coen's best effort. I believe that it was an empty symbol. They just used it because it was pretty cool to show that hat being blown by the wind. Now you can attach any abstract meaning you want to it, I just don't think there is one.

35ZtTBFqaa	3 looks cool.|`|GjkBFw3Gaa	The third one looks the best but needs more defining on the edges.|`|j9wfh8YLaa	the 4th is the best. the new logos (1-3) are just two cheesy typefaces smashed together, and the more complex ones (2-3) get too complicated without any payoff. and by "payoff" i mean that when two recognizable shapes are smashed together, and they create a relevant third shape (like a camera lens, aperture, photographic instrument, etc, etc, etc.,) you get an "ah-ha" moment that makes you smile and remember the logo. those don't do that.<br>  <br>  the 4th is simple, geometric, and sophisticated. has potential for use in other identity materials (brochure, website, business card, etc.) either as a definitive logo mark or general a graphic element. dots!|`|sUReU8B5aa	Hmm... I'm torn between #2 and #3. But I think I like the #2 better because of the green fill that you will really notice the letter "D". But all four of them are nice. Good job!|`|wLcQs7jFaa	I like one.
