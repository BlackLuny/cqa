9GMePSopaa	You will weigh exactly the same.    The force due to gravity is equal to GMm/r^2  Gravity cannot be weakened by any medium, nothing can detract from it's presence.   Your mass does not change in a vacuum, nor does the strength of the gravitational field.    Thus, weight is unchanged :)    [Who rated me down? Factors such as buoyancy and pressure do NOT affect weight. They can only affect what is an apparent weight. Weight is a product that is dependant upon mass and gravitational field strength, not atmospheric conditions!]|`|VkXv4RInaa	since at ground level, the atmosphere is pressurized, we experience a force pushing us down from the pressure of the atmosphere. in a vaccum chamber, we would still experience gravity, but the force from the pressure of the air will be gone, thus a person would weigh less.|`|NWcBNAgdaa	Weight is the influence of gravity on a mass. The local atmosphere has nothing to do with it.|`|ssK4oJi9aa	you will weigh more by the amount of air you displace because you will lose the buoyancy of the air.

cKzfxE0Zaa	There are several known ancient or very ancient pyramids in Europe, notably in Bosnia and in Greece. Speculated ages range from 12000 BC up to 2500 BC, with the later date being roughly contemporary with the pyramids of ancient Egypt. (The earlier date, of course, antedates the pyramids of Egypt by several millennia.)    Further, there are known European samples of loom woven linen cloth and fired pottery from dates as early as 28000 BC. Solutrean bifacially chipped flint arrowheads have been found which date to about 18000 BC.    It seems the civilization may have appeared first in Europe, not in the Middle East. Mideast civilizations might have been the result of the export of technology and culture from Europe.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	"When people say civilisation began 6000 years"    Very few people actually say that, especially if they study in that field.    We have recently discovered a "calendar device" that seems right for about 8000 BC (ten thousand years ago).  If a "tribe" was knowledgeable enough to figure out solstices and equinoces, I'd call that civilized.    The idea that things began 6000 years ago (actually, 6,011 years and 3 months) comes from a paranoid Calvinist who lived in the 17th century in Ireland.  He is the one who came up with the idea that the world was created on October 23, 4004 BC.    In those days, it was common for philosophers to calculate a "chronology". Because of Religion's dominance on everything, one had to base it on the Bible, but other sources were also allowed.    Even Isaac Newton tried it.    In any event, the only thing that everyone was sure of, is that the world was at least 7500 years old (from evidence found in the Middle East).    When our Irish friend published his Chronology in 1650, saying that the Earth was only 5,653 years old, it was immediately rejected by all the others.    Our Calvinist friend was also anti-papist.  As far as he was concerned, to have his work rejected was, for him, a "proof" that he was right.    And that is the source that is quoted, when people say that civilization is only 6,000 years old.|`|YdGsp59kaa	I don't know who's saying that civilization began in 6,000 BCE.  I supposed it depends on how you define "civilization."  Laws? Communities?    And I'm not sure which pyramids you believe were created earlier than that.  The Giza pyramids date to well within recorded history, as do the older ones at Saqqara and elsewhere in Egypt.    The people who have a scientific rationale for dating the dawn of civilization will naturally account for large-scale construction in their dating.  That is, if some large enterprise is discovered to date to (hypothetically) 6,000 BCE, then naturally the date of civilization must extend at least that far back, because the enterprise is itself evidence of coordinated activity.    Where you would get a discrepancy is if someone had ulterior motives for wanting to date the dawn of civilization later than it actually occurred.  That is, they're not basing their dating on empirical evidence.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	The people who say that are only reciting the tenets of their religion, all scientific evidence aside.  The Earth is actually about 4.54 billion years old.  The oldest pyramid, the step pyramid at Saqqara was built by Pharaoh Djoser circa 2630 BC.  That would make it about 4640 years old.    "The Earth's crust is continually being created, modified,and destroyed. As a result, rocks that record its earliest history have not been found and probably no longer exist. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that the Earth and the other bodies of the Solar System are 4.5-4.6 billion years old.     The principal evidence for the antiquity of Earth and its cosmic surroundings is:    1. The oldest rocks on Earth, found in western Greenland, have been dated by four independent radiometric dating methods at 3.7-3.8 billion years. Rocks 3.4-3.6 billion years in age have been found in southern Africa, western Australia, and the Great Lakes region of North America. These oldest rocks are metamorphic rocks but they originated as lava flows and sedimentary rocks. The debris from which the sedimentary rocks formed must have come from even older crustal rocks. The oldest dated minerals (4.0-4.2 billion years) are tiny zircon crystals found in sedimentary rocks in western Australia.    2. The oldest Moon rocks are from the lunar highlands and were formed when the early lunar crust was partially or entirely molten. These rocks, of which only a few were returned by the Apollo missions, have been dated by two methods at between 4.4-4.5 billion years.     3.  The majority of the 70 well-dated meteorites have ages of 4.4-4.6 billion years. These meteorites, which are fragments of asteroids and represent some of the most primitive material in the solar system, have been dated by 5 independent radiometric dating methods.    4. The "best" age for the Earth is based on the time required for the lead isotopes in four very old lead ores (galena) to have evolved from the composition of lead at the time the Solar System formed, as recorded in the Canyon Diablo iron meteorite. This "model leadage" is 4.54 billion years."|`|Aty76cgqaa	What you speak of is the earliest archaeological evidence of civilization which has been unearthed between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is now Iraq. This earliest civilization was known as Mesopotamia. Civilizations may have existed before that time, but as of yet there exists no archaeological evidence.     The first known pyramids were step pyramids constructed during the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. This was between 2686 - 2575 BC.|`|AA11065099	It sounds like the so-called experts are once more in disagreement.  I think they really do not know themselves when civilization began or when the pyramids were build.  They are trying to deceive the general population that they know more than others on these matters.  You might learn more if you could check out the authenticity of their credentials and what they did to acquire them.    A genuine and honest academic or scholar could only make a best attempt in establishing a possible date for the beginning of civilization.  The further back they would go, the more inaccurate they might be.  Changes can be either rapid or slow.  Who empowered these experts on establishing timelines?|`|qpxPW5paaa	The pyramids where built by Aliens|`|AA12284392	Human civilization, from what I've read, has existed for something like 100,000 years.    There are fundamentalist christians who claim that the earth itself is only 6,000 years old, having been created by their god during the "creation" at the beginning of their bible, but they're taking a myth literally and can generally be ignored.|`|IJTcGIG7aa	Most of the major pyramids were constructed between 2000 and 2800 BC.....4000 to 5000 years ago....well within the 6000 year timespan.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	Civilization as we have chose civilization to be described by our "agreed" necessities -  began 8 thousand years ago. I say it was much earlier, but I speak individually, not collectively. So the majority APPARENTLY wins!|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	The age of the pyramids of Giza and Saqqara are known to within 10 to 20 years, depending on which one you mean.  They have been dated by documentary evidence and by things like radiocarbon dating.      Here is an interesting fact. It is almost exactly 1000 years between the reigns of Alfred the Great of southern England and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. We know exactly when these monarchs reigned.  If you divide the thousand years by the number of monarchs, including Oliver Cromwell and Lady Jane Grey, you will get an average length of reign for those reigning before modern medicine existed.      We know exactly when Cleopatra became Queen of Egypt.  If you add up the number of Egyptian monarchs between Cheops and Cleopatra and multiply the total by the average length of reign of the English monarchs, you get the same date the archaeologists say for the Cheops pyramid, to within a few years.      So there is little doubt they are correct.      The much earlier date is based on the apparent fact that  the three big pyramids on the Giza plateau seem to model the three big stars in the belt of Orion. But the angle is wrong, so to get the same angle the people who say that the pyramids were built to do that have to wind back the calendar 10 or 15 thousand years to when the angle of Orion matched the angle of the pyramids.  Slim evidence indeed.    But the pyramids are where they are because the rocky plateau is a good foundation for a heavy building.  The pyramids follow the shape of the plateau.  The Egyptians were not stupid enough to put heavy buildings on muddy ground again, one pyramid had already collapsed because of that a few decades before they started to build the big ones.|`|NgUbzaF9aa	There's many more structures and human remains that predate that. The fact that carbon dating is still not 100% accurate is irrelevant. It can comfortably age carbon up to 50,000 years.

As an added bonus, letting google calculator do this for you shows that it's a pretty popular homework question :)    Edit:    OK, one person who got it `wrong' just didn't give units.  If you assume his units are hours, he gives the right number.  (But since he didn't give his units, if he turned that in on a homework assignment he'd lose points.)

(That's one nice thing about using google or similar programs for calculations like this -- it always gets the units right.)    Edit  2 :    More wrong answers are appearing ...    50,000 km/hr is not equal to c/6.  50,000 km/SECOND is.  So his answer of 26.4 years is off by a factor of 3600.|`|O7rMKLEMaa	50,000 km/hr = c/6. So it takes 6 x 4.4 = 26.4  years.     If you need a more exact answer, use c = 299,792,458 km/hr, and if necessary, apply the formulas of special relativity. You don't have to apply special relativity unless you're talking about light years in one coordinate system and years in the other coordinate system. In that case, the correction factor is (1-v^2/c^2)  (1-1/25) = 24/25  .98. (Use the exact speed of light to get exact answers.)    In other words, if the distance is 4.4 light years from an Earth-bound perspective, the ship will get there in 26.4 years according to Earth clocks and about 25.9 years according to the ship's clock.

2517e496eeec3bf4d807f725dc255ce0aa	The 35.5 is the relative atomic mass of chlorine.  These masses are what you will find on the periodic table of elements.  It is called the relative atomic mass because all of the masses listed on the table are relative to carbon 12, which is defined as having a mass of exactly 12.    The relative atomic mass is also equal to the mole weight for that element in grams.  One mole of chlorine has a mass of 35.5 grams.

Km9QC8a9aa	It's all about displacement.    When you put the anchor into the water, the pool's water level goes DOWN a bit.    When the anchor is in the boat, the mass of the anchor is part of the mass of the boat -- which is displacing an equal mass of water in order to float.    When the anchor is in the water, the mass of the anchor is no longer part of the mass of the boat and the water line on the boat (and in the pool) actually goes down a bit.  HOWEVER  The anchor displaces it's own VOLUME of water and sinks. When it was in the boat, the anchor displaced it's own MASS, which is a greater volume of water.|`|lsuVEx0Faa	The water level actually drops! Before you drop the anchor, it is being supported by the displacement of the boat. As the anchor sinks, it is a fair bet that it is heavier than a similar volume of water, so the boat has to displace water equivelent to the weight of the anchor.    When the anchor is dropped, assuming it actually touches bottom, the weight of the anchor is removedfrom the boat, so the boat actually rises in the water, creating a smaller hole in the water, hence the water surface drops from where it was.     If the anchor is "dangled" from the boat, things are different, but then thats fishing, not anchoring.|`|GXR2ic5Xaa	This is due to Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force supporting an object on a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that is displaced. Since the weight of the boat and anchor do not change when you put the anchor in the water, the same amount of fluid must be displaced as before in order to keep the boat afloat.    Imagine a (sort-of) analogous example: You are standing on a scale with a yo-yo in your hand. If you drop the yo-yo so that it is hanging from the string, the reading on the scale does not change--the scale must still apply the same upward force to hold your weight.

IbJ2O0vpaa	No, it's unrelated to steroid compounds, and this side effects is not listed in the most comprehensive pharmacology text I know of (Goodman and Gilman) or others in my office. For what it's worth, I've known multiple individuals who took Klonopin for extended periods, and none experienced this side effect.    Klonopin is metabolized in a way that would not obviously affect testosterone metabolism.    But the product information sheet from the manufacturer does list hair loss and hirsutism, which would both seem likely to be caused by increases in testosterone.  So while this may be an extremely rare side effect, the PDR appears to be correct. I would imagine this is an indirect effect on steroid metabolism in rare individuals, but suspect no one knows the mechanism(s) as it doesn't occur often enough to study.|`|xKUC8O8saa	I don't think that's entirely true.

YZAMZFKeaa	From least reactive to most reactive...    Nitrobenzene, bromobenzene, phenol...    EAS reactions involve an electrophile adding to (with loss of a aromatic proton) an aromatic ring. Making the aromatic ring more electron-rich is one way of 'speeding up' the process. That being said, nitrobenzene will be the least reactive of the three choices given due to the strong electron withdrawing effect of the nitro group. Bromobenzene is next on the list as bromine is also electronegative. Phenol is the most reactive as the OH group is electron donating...    Hope this helps!!!|`|b691c3ca62fd1d8844180c2c83daccbcaa	What do you know about the EAS reaction? It begins with the attack of an electrophile on the aromatic system of the benzene ring (common to all three compounds). The exact location of successful attacks will be determined by the nature of the substituent groups, according to whether they are electron donating or electron withdrawing. The -OH and Br- substituents are both electron-rich and can stabilize the positive charge of an electrophile by pushing electrons toward it through the pi-bonds of the benzene ring. The -NO2 group, however, is electron withdrawing and makes it more difficult for an electrophile to successfully attack the pi system of the benzene ring.  The O atom of -OH has a lone pair of electrons that can easily move into the pi system, while the electrons of the Br atom have to come from the p atomic orbitals of a different quantum level which is less likely to happen. Considering these factors, what do you think the logical order should be? (If you just want to guess, you've got a one-in-six chance of getting it right...)    -OH, -NO2, -Br ?  -Br, -OH, -NO2 ?  -OH, -Br, -NO2 ?  -Br, -NO2, -OH ?  -NO2, -Br, -OH ?  -NO2, -OH, -Br ?

k5Ece8BTaa	On a clear sunny day, the sky above us looks bright blue. In the evening, the sunset puts on a brilliant show of reds, pinks and oranges. Why is the sky blue? What makes the sunset red?     To answer these questions, we must learn about light, and the Earth's atmosphere.     ? Why is the sky blue?  The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.     However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.     As you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white.     ? The Atmosphere  The atmosphere is the mixture of gas molecules and other materials surrounding the earth. It is made mostly of the gases nitrogen (78%), and oxygen (21%). Argon gas and water (in the form of vapor, droplets and ice crystals) are the next most common things. There are also small amounts of other gases, plus many small solid particles, like dust, soot and ashes, pollen, and salt from the oceans.     The composition of the atmosphere varies, depending on your location, the weather, and many other things. There may be more water in the air after a rainstorm, or near the ocean. Volcanoes can put large amounts of dust particles high into the atmosphere. Pollution can add different gases or dust and soot.     The atmosphere is densest (thickest) at the bottom, near the Earth. It gradually thins out as you go higher and higher up. There is no sharp break between the atmosphere and space.     ? Light Waves   Light is a kind of energy that radiates, or travels, in waves. Many different kinds of energy travel in waves. For example, sound is a wave of vibrating air. Light is a wave of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. It is one small part of a larger range of vibrating electromagnetic fields. This range is called the electromagnetic spectrum.     Electromagnetic waves travel through space at 299,792 km/sec (186,282 miles/sec). This is called the speed of light.     The energy of the radiation depends on its wavelength and frequency. Wavelength is the distance between the tops (crests) of the waves. Frequency is the number of waves that pass by each second. The longer the wavelength of the light, the lower the frequency, and the less energy it contains.     ? Colors of Light  Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can see. Light from the sun or a light bulb may look white, but it is actually a combination of many colors. We can see the different colors of the spectrum by splitting the light with a prism. The spectrum is also visible when you see a rainbow in the sky.     The colors blend continuously into one another. At one end of the spectrum are the reds and oranges. These gradually shade into yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The colors have different wavelengths, frequencies, and energies. Violet has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum. That means it has the highest frequency and energy. Red has the longest wavelength, and lowest frequency and energy.     ? Light in the air  Light travels through space in a straight line as long as nothing disturbs it. As light moves through the atmosphere, it continues to go straight until it bumps into a bit of dust or a gas molecule. Then what happens to the light depends on its wave length and the size of the thing it hits.     Dust particles and water droplets are much larger than the wavelength of visible light. When light hits these large particles, it gets reflected, or bounced off, in different directions. The different colors of light are all reflected by the particle in the same way. The reflected light appears white because it still contains all of the same colors.     Gas molecules are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. If light bumps into them, it acts differently. When light hits a gas molecule, some of it may get absorbed. After awhile, the molecule radiates (releases, or gives off) the light in a different direction. The color that is radiated is the same color that was absorbed. The different colors of light are affected differently. All of the colors can be absorbed. But the higher frequencies (blues) are absorbed more often than the lower frequencies (reds). This process is called Rayleigh scattering. (It is named after Lord John Rayleigh, an English physicist, who first described it in the 1870's.)|`|phWUBtviaa	Prism|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	The blue color of the sky is caused by the scattering of sunlight off the molecules of the atmosphere. This scattering, called Rayleigh scattering, is more effective at short wavelengths (the blue end of the visible spectrum). Therefore the light scattered down to the earth at a large angle with respect to the direction of the sun's light is predominantly in the blue end of the spectrum.  It is the scattering of blue light.     The white light from the sun is a mixture of all colours of the rainbow.  This was demonstrated by Isaac Newton, who used a prism to separate the different colours and so form a spectrum.  The colours of light are distinguished by their different wavelengths.  The visible part of the spectrum ranges from red light with a wavelength of about 720 nm, to violet with a wavelength of about 380 nm, with orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo between.  The three different types of colour receptors in the retina of the human eye respond most strongly to red, green and blue wavelengths, giving us our colour vision.    Tyndall Effect  The first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859.  He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red.  This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.  This is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later.  He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles.  It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	The sky is not blue, it only appears blue.  The sky is clear and transparent - just like it is at night when the moon and stars shine through it without being altered in their color.  The blue sky color is an optical illusion - just like a rainbow.    A rainbow isn't a real object although the colors you see are real.  You can make a rainbow with a garden hose and a sprinkler head and the Sun.  The rainbow looks like it is real and really there but when you turn the water off the rainbow goes away.      The reason the rainbow has colors is because the light going into a rain drop is refracted and then is totally internally reflected and then is refracted as it exits the drop.  The angle of refraction of the light is color dependent.  That produces the rainbow's colors.  Notice that the rainbow always appears opposite the Sun.  The Sun has to be at your back.    In a similar way the blue color of the sky is created all over the sky and it looks like there is a real blue sky but it goes away when the sun goes down.  The object we call the blue sky is an optical illusion.    The blue sky color is created when sunlight shines through the Earth's atmosphere during the day.  The atmosphere is mostly composed of oxygen, argon and nitrogen gasses.  As sunlight shines through the atmospheric gasses some of the light is scattered in all directions by the very molecules of the gasses.  This scattering process, called Raleigh Scattering is very wavelength dependent.  Blue light is scattered in all directions about 10 times as much as red light is scattered and so we see mostly blue light coming from the direction of the sky.    The blue sky is light scattered from the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere The rainbow is created by refraction of light within a rain drop.|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	reflection of the water on the planet|`|PD0lXVIKaa	I think if i remember correctly that its the way the sun shines through the particles in the air and blue is the color shone through diffraction.

QHjjp7gaaa	More CO2 in the air will cause more CO2 to go into solution in the ocean's waters (I believe it's Boyle's law).  Just like with soda/cola, the CO2 reacts with the H2O to form carbolic acid, thereby making the water more acidic (lower pH).  This reaction can be buffered by the organisms living in the surface waters - most importantly phytoplankton.  The increased CO2 levels should cause an increase in the phytoplankton population as they use CO2 and sunlight to grow/reproduce.  These additional organisms will take up additional CO2 and incorporate it into their cells.  They will, in turn, either be eaten, or die and eventually the organic waste they become will settle to the ocean floor as solid organic matter which will contain the carbon which was originally atmospheric CO2.|`|xXOnjDNOaa	Carbon dioxide has an interesting equilibrium with water. When CO2 dissolves in water it becomes H2CO3 (Carbonic Acid).  Just on the surface one would assume that an increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere would have a corresponding rise in acidity of the water (you may recall Henry's law about solubility of gases).  It's a bit more complex than that though, because carbonic acid can also can end up in several different forms (Bicarbonate is HCO3- and carbonate is CO3(2-),  both of these can serve as bases reacting H+ to give water and CO2 again).  This is one of the same buffering systems that work to maintain the pH in the bloodstream.

EDjKCt0baa	Eugenics is a pseudo-science. It is considered ethically evil by many. "Eugenics" refers to "purifying" a genome by artificially selecting traits considered to be desirable and pure-breeding those traits so that the whole population will have this trait. Hitler attempted this with his extermination of minorities and encouraging the breeding of a so-called "superior" race.    What you talk about is genetic engineering, please don't confuse the two. Genetic engineering is manipulating the genes of an individual to achieve a desired set of traits. This also raises ethical questions. I don't see human genetic engineering like what you describe happening in the near future even if the technology for something that advanced was available. (It's not).     I'm not sure what you mean by "type of car", but I drive a 2005 Jeep Liberty.
sa8dElLZaa	A region of space characterized by the existence of a force generated by electric charge.    Region around an electric charge in which an electric force is exerted on another charge. The strength of an electric field E at any point is defined as the electric force F exerted per unit positive electric charge q at that point, or E = F/q. An electric field has both magnitude and direction and can be represented by lines of force, or field lines, that start on positive charges and terminate on negative charges. The electric field is stronger where the field lines are close together than where they are farther apart. The value of the electric field has dimensions of force per unit charge and is measured in units of newtons per coulomb.

bRfLyvPIaa	It doesn't.    Gross primary production (GPP) is basically the total amount of photosynthesis that occurs in an ecosystem. But plants respire part of their fixed C back into the atmosphere, so net primary production (NPP) is the amount of photosynthesis minus plant respiration.    Photosynthesis increases with increases in the amount of foliage, which is why productivity of forest tends to be higher than that of grassland - forests have a larger vertical distribution of leaves. But the amount of foliage in a forest peaks when the crowns of the trees grow together (foresters call this crown closure), so GPP levels off after that.    But plant respiration is related to total plant biomass, and the trees keep getting bigger after the crowns close, so plant respiration continues to go up. Since GPP is constant but respiration goes up, NPP declines in older forests.    In the source listed below for the Great Smokey Mountains National Park, the NPP of older stands was 6-10 Mg/ha/year, whereas that of the younger stands on similar sites was 12-13 Mg/ha/year.    If you're talking about Net Ecosystem Productivity, that's just NPP minus heterotrophic respiration, or the respiration of the things that eat the plants (and things that eat them). Heterotrophic respiration tends to be high in the very early successional stages, because there's so much foliage near the ground where they can get at it, and then levels off and remains fairly constant during the time of forest maturation.

It is considered one of the most devastating man-made environmental disasters ever to occur at sea.     As significant as the Exxon Valdez spill was, it ranks well down on the list of the world's largest oil spills in terms of volume released.    However, Prince William Sound's remote location (accessible only by helicopter and boat) made government and industry response efforts difficult and severely taxed existing plans for response.     The region was a habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals, and seabirds.      And try this website    v
90d92a076012fbb35f3a5fa11ad4e4b6aa	Okay, the equation is balanced already, that is good.  Now, lets convert 23.6g Al to mol of Al:  23.6g Al * (1mol Al / 26.98g Al) = 0.875mol Al  Now here is a concept you need to understand: stoichiometrically equivalent molar ratios. Big name, simple concept. What it means is that, we look at the coefficients of the (balanced) chemical equation. This equation says that for every 2 moles of Al in the reaction, 1 mol of Al2O3 is produced. (Similarly we could say that for every 2 mol of Al in the reaction, there is one mol of Fe2O3 in the reaction. Actually try to understand this concept instead of just taking my word for it. It will make your chemistry course much easier, believe me.)    Anyway, with that said, watch how I use the molar ratios (equation coefficients):    0.875mol Al * (1mol Al2O3 / 2mol Al) = 0.438mol Al2O3  Now, use the molar mass of Al2O3 to convert this to grams:  molar mass of Al2O3 = 101.96 g/mol      0.438mol Al2O3 * (101.96g Al2O3 / 1mol Al2O3) = 44.66g Al2O3  Answer: 44.66g Al2O3    For the second question, use the stoichiometrically equivalent molar ratio concept once again, this time we are working from the product side to the reactant side whereas the last question we worked from the reactant side to product side.    Step 1.) Find the number of moles of Fe in 475g Fe:  475g Fe * (1mol Fe / 55.85g Fe) = 8.50 mol Fe    For every 2mol of Fe produced, 1 mol of Fe2O3 is involved in the reaction:    8.50mol Fe * (1mol Fe2O3 / 2mol Fe) = 4.25mol Fe2O3  Use the molar mass of Fe2O3 (which equals 159.70 g/mol) to convert from moles to grams:    4.25mol Fe2O3 * (159.70g Fe2O3/ 1mol Fe2O3) = 679 g Fe2O3  Answer: 679 g Fe2O3    Third question:  I don't need to explain as much on this example as it is done similarly to the other two.    97.6g Al2O3 * (1mol Al2O3 / 101.96g Al2O3) = 0.957mol Al2O3    0.957mol Al2O3 * (2mol Fe / 1mol Al2O3) = 1.91mol Fe  molar mass of Fe = 55.85 g/mol    1.91mol Fe * (55.85 g Fe / 1mol Fe) = 107g Fe  Answer: 107g Fe      I hope this helps. Like I said, please don't just take my answers without looking at how I did it and not trying to understand the stoichiometrically equivalent molar ratios concept. Understanding it will benefit you greatly as many chemistry problems can be solved by using variations of this concept, it is very important.
vvYQUbkYaa	the absolute value signs |x| mean the distance a number is on the real number line from 0. like |7|=7, |-6|=6. if you know how to solve for a variable in a regular equation, set up these like two equations. like for the first, |-3n|-2=7, first eliminate the -2 from the left side to get |-3n|=9. and because of the absolute value signs, -3n could either be 9 or -9. either way, the final answer turns out to be 9 because |9|=|-9|=9. so set it up, like -3n=9 and -3n=-9, and solve for both. n can either be 3 or -3 in this case. and repeat for the others.|`|EUd3HjFhaa	this kind of problem is called absolute value.

This is called absolute value. I.e the first problem is the absolute value of negative 3n decreased by 2 is equal to 7. Here we can change the negative 3n into a positive because it is the absolute value. Then we can add 2 to each side because to eliminate the 2 we have to do the opposite. That would be to add to to each side. now we have 3n=9. Now we divide both sides by three to get n alone and n=3.   You should be able to solve the rest.|`|XrKLAhfiaa	When you're working with absolute values, you need to keep in mind that there are two cases.  Either the stuff inside the absolute value is already positive, in which case we just work with the way we normally would.  The other case is when the stuff inside the absolute value is negative, so then we take the absolute value, and change the sign to make it positive.  So because we have these two cases, we need to look at both cases when we solve each problem.  If that didn't make sense, let me show you...    |-3n| - 2=7  Our two cases are that (-3n) is already positive, or (-3n) is negative - the positive case occurs if n is negative, and we multiply a negative n by -3 and get a positive product.  The negative case happens when n is positive, and is multiplied by -3.  So, with that in mind, we actually need to solve two equations:  (-3n) - 2 = 7  This is the case where the stuff in the absolute value is positive, so we don't need to change the sign.  -(-3n) - 2 = 7  This is the case where the stuff inside the absolute value is negative, so we change its sign.  Now let's solve both:  (-3n) - 2 = 7  -3n = 9  n = -3    -(-3n) - 2 = 7  3n = 9  n = 3    Now we need to check both solutions in the original equation, to see which works:  |(-3)(-3)| - 2 = 7  |9| = 9  9 = 9, so n = -3 works    |(-3)(3)| - 2 = 7  |-9| = 9  9 = 9, so n = 3 works  Therefore, your solution is n = -3 or n = 3.    |t|+2.7=4.5  We will use the same idea for this one.    (t) + 2.7 = 4.5  t = 1.8    -(t) + 2.7 = 4.5  -t = 1.8  t = -1.8    |1.8| + 2.7 = 4.5  4.5 = 4.5 , so t = 1.8 works    |-1.8| + 2.7 = 4.5  1.8 + 2.7 = 4.5  4.5 = 4.5, so t = -1.8 also works  Your solution is t = 1.8 or t = -1.8.    -2|c - 4|=-8    -2(c - 4) = -8  -2c + 8 = -8  -2c = -16  c = 8    -2( -(c - 4) ) = -8  -2(-c + 4) = -8  2c - 8 = -8  2c = 0  c = 0    -2|8 - 4| = -8  -2(4) = -8  -8 = -8, so c = 8 works    -2|0 - 4| = -8  -2|-4| = -8  -2(4) = -8  -8 = -8, so c = 0 works  Your solution is c = 8 or c = 0.    |n| - 3>7    n - 3 > 7  n > 10    -n - 3 > 7  -n > 10  n     To check n > 10, pick any value for n that is greater than 10, such as 12.  |12| - 3 > 7  12 > 10  Since that is true, n > 10 works    To check n   |-12| - 3 > 7  12 > 10  Since this is also true, n  10 or n     |v|/-3=-4.2    v/(-3) = -4.2  v = (-3)(-4.2)  v = 12.6    (-v)/(-3) = -4.2  v/3 = -4.2  v = -12.6    |12.6|/(-3) = -4.2  12.6 = 12.6, so v = 12.6 works    |-12.6|/(-3) = -4.2  12.6 = 12.6, so v = -12.6 works also and your solution is v = 12.6 or v = -12.6.    Hope that helps.  :)
HRI8BhS6aa	A sponge is essentially a water-filtering system.  The sponges don't move and all species must feed on food particles suspended in the water. In all cases, poriferans have a canal system, through which they pump water. Water enters through pores called ostia, flows through canals to a spacious chamber called a spongocoel, and finally exits through large openings called oscula. Sponges have no specialized reproductive, digestive, respiratory, sensory, or excretory organs found in this group|`|k0j1Mh04aa	Filter feeders like sponges have cells that are called in current pores.

m2pNTLloaa	Air Bags are worthless.      Ever wonder:  Why there is a decal that tells you to put your seat belt on in a car with air bags?      Why there is an alarm that gripes at you until you put your seat belt on.      Why there are no air bags on airliners?    Why you are told to put a child in the backseat and strap them down with a seat belt?  (The air bag can kill or injure a child or frail adult,  Actually most adults are injured to some extent by the air bag when it inflates)    The air bag protects you against the first impact from the direction of the center-line of the bag.  After that, you are on your own.  Most serious automobile accidents have multiple impacts from several directions and involve rotations that creates centripetal forces that slam you around the interior of the car.  The air bag does nothing to protect you.  What will save your life is that low tech device, the seat belt that holds you in-place until the car comes to rest.  The seat belt is the only device that does this.  Air bags give a false sense of safety, causing many to NOT buckle-up (Why should you, the air bag will save your butt.  LIES!

DhrbLF71aa	A plant can grow wider due to the cambium. This is a cylinder of lateral dividing cells (lateral meristematic cells). Xylem tissue is formed on the inside of the ring and phloem on the outside making the trunk or stem wider. I can't remember any more detail than this, sorry.    Height is achieved by cell division at apical meristems. Elongation and vacuolation of cells occurs and then the cells differentiate to become specialised. Apical meristems reside in plant apical buds and roots.    Do you mean flowering plants (angiosperms)? If so then the advantages are that they have sieve tubes (phloem) for better food transport in stem, double fertilisation which creates a food source (endosperm) for the seed thus increasing likelihood of survival and the ovule is enclosed giving protection.

I'm not being a smartass, either.  Physicians need to pay attention to details.    You start getting paid (note spelling) after you complete medical school, when you secure a residency position.  Internship is another name for the first year of residency, so if you spend two years doing it, something isn't right.

Cons:  -No family time  -Violent and abusive patients are common in this field  -Pay scale is iffy  -Resuscitations and death are common  -Patients and attenders often do not remember or acknowledge the effort you would have put in    Pros:  -The scope of EM extends a variety of medicine & surgery. You can see patients who can be categorized into every known specialty  -You are never bored :)  -You play a major and most significant role in prehospital care and disaster management  -Work is only during duty hours. You're free once you leave the emergency department. You don't have to worry about any patients  -There will not be any patients for regular follow up like in other specialties  -Every patient has a new unexpected problem    Hope I helped.

There are a couple cons such as no family time, hard to maintain a relationship, and long work hours. BUT, there are several ways to circumvent those cons as time passes. Of course the first couple years when you first get a job as a emergency medicine physician you work like a dog, period. However, the more years you work at a hospital the more say you get. So it is possible to cut your hours down to fit your schedule and so you have time to maintain a relationship and time to spend with your family. I believe it is a great field in the long run. Hope I helped.

Because sexualy reproduced organisms can adapt so they can become tougher when they need to, and withstand different climates, etc.     While Asexually reproduced organisms are always exactly the same, and if the climate changes, or another organism is intruding on them, then they can't adapt to it, so they end up not being able to survive.|`|q5OWGYvDaa	In a nutshell, the offspring of organisms that reproduce sexually have genotypes made from a combination of both parents.  For sexually reproducing organisms, (like us) each individual has a unique genotype.  This is an advantage if the population in question lives in a changing environment, as the genetic recombination provides a higher probability that some members of the population will develop an adaptation.  However, asexual reproduction is faster and more efficient (all things being equal) and can be an advantage in highly stable environments.

X8LNbaKQaa	Opamps used as gain blocks are programmed for some particular gain (and whether the gain is inverting or non inverting)  with connections of resistors.  As long as the opamp gain (the 100,000 you mention, which falls as frequency rises) is much greater than thet programmed by the resistors, the programming almost totally controls the gain.

wKhtBQTTaa	no, no, no!  There are millions of different species of animals alive today.  Not one is in the midst of changing into another species.  Each animal is complete and perfect with no intermediate "evolution" changes taking place.  You can take a dog and make it into a great dane, or a poodle, or any number of other types of dogs that no longer look like the original parent but it will always be a dog no matter how much selective breeding you do.  This is called variation within the species.  But one species cannot and has not changed into another.  This supports the Bible verse in Genesis chapter two that animals will reproduce after their own kind.|`|bRfLyvPIaa	If you're really interested, the link below is a good one.

Yes, yes, and yes.  There are many examples of observed evolution - including Industrial Melanism of the Peppered Moth, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the new 'flu strain that arises every year, observed speciation events in fruitflies and mosquitoes, etc.  For a couple of excellent examples see:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_lon...  (where a 20-year study has mapped many evolutionary changes in E. coli bacteria)  and:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_wal...  (where rapid evolution of Podarcis sicula - the Italian wall lizard - has been observed in Mediterranean Islands)      > "A scientist tried getting life from bacteria in water and all he came up with was a poison. He failed"    ???  Do you mean a scientist tried to *create* bacteria? If so, then this has nothing to do with evolution - which only maps the *changes* in organisms with time, not their creation.      > "The finches are not evidence though. Differents variations of the same species and the same goes for the lizards. A bird is still a bird and a lizard is still a lizard."    This is true, as far as it goes. But since evolution just means "populations of organisms change in their characteristics over time", it is still evolution that has been observed.    > "I think the simarities could also point to a common designer. God the Creator."    This is possible, of course. BUT:  we can directly observe evolution-in-action, and we cannot directly observe a Creator. So it is not rational to propose His/Her existence and involvement in the changes in organisms.    > "I also seen the pictures of the real embryos and they don't lool alike at all."    Good job you're not a Developmental Biologist then, since they embryos *do* indeed have analogous structures.    > "Yes Tim I believe that too. God created everything in six literal 24 days."    Do you have any evidence for this supposition?|`|3SzLeAMwaa	There is evidence to support that evolution does exist. (not to the extreme that humans evolved from monkeys), but that species change over time.  Evidence comes from:  1. Fossil Records  2. Comparative Anatomy (Homologous structures)  3.Comparative Embryology  4.Molecular Biology (protein, DNA sequence)      It has been observed in the Galapagos Islands. ex: finches and lizards|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Yes, yes, and yes.    Dr Richard Lenski has been observing 12 populations of E. coli for more than a decade.  Recently, one culture evolved the ability to digest citrate.    However, I think you are misinterpreting the scientific method.  You can't conceivably repeat some processes, such as the entire course of evolution.  It doesn't have to be repeatable, merely the observation and data supporting it.    And the data is overwhelming and consists of several independent lines of evidence.  You cannot get a much more solid case than that.|`|h3Xbi8fVaa	Why did your god give me an appendix or a blind spot?  What about a tail bone?    Is he a bad designer?

Sorry can you explain that?|`|3BGJETHYaa	I am curious as to what you think evolution is, exactly.     I suggest reading The Origin of Species?  Even if you don't believe evolution is real, it is an excellent piece of literature arguing the viewpoint.      If you want a more modern example: A bacteria, E. Coli, is known for its inability to digest citrate.  Digesting citrate in a citrate rich environment would be advantageous, but it doesn't live there normally, and doesn't have the ability. There is nothing it can use to digest citrate.    A scientest recently has been undertaking an experiment in which he put e coli in environments with high levels of citrate.  Recently, a single bacterium developed a mutation that allows it to produce a brand new enzyme that digests citrate.  The bacteria with this mutation was more successfully and quickly took over that colony, leaving only its descendants.|`|AA11513203	Yes, yes, and yes.    Scientists would not be almost *unanimous* in supporrting evolution if the answer was no.    First, you need to know what the word 'evolution' means.    It doesn't *HAVE* to mean one species becoming a different species.   Evolution just means "change over time".  Period.    So if a short-beaked finch becomes a long-beaked finch, *THAT'S EVOLUTION*.   Period.    So in that very trivial sense, it has indeed been observed, tested, and repeated.   Many, many, many times.    >" A scientist tried getting life from bacteria in water and all he came up with was a poison. He failed"    ???   Bacteria in water *IS LIFE*!    So it makes no sense to be trying to "get life" from bacteria in water.    And if you drink a glass of water with botulism bacteria ... that's poisonous!   But that doesn't mean there is no life there!    So I have no idea who you are talking about ... but it doesn't matter anyway.   You don't point to ONE "failed experiment" and say that this disproves *ALL* experiments!   C'mon.

Evolutions refers to the change in allele frequencies in populations, over time.    Allele frequencies in populations really do change over time.  That's been observed, more than once.|`|EDjKCt0baa	Yes. Sort of. It depends on how you define "evolution". Scientists have taken colonies of bacteria and exposed them to different anti-biotics. Most of the bacteria died, but some, who were more resistant, survived. These surviving bacteria reproduced, and eventually, all the bacteria were resistant to that particular anti-biotic. This is a perfect example of natural selection altering the genome of a species.        However, something like this experiment is only possible in species that reproduce very rapidly. (like bacteria). This is indeed evolution, but this process has yet to be tried on many "more advanced" species because of the numbers problem. (though a few studies have been performed on higher level organisms).    What you are talking about in the "recreate life from inorganic molecules" experiment is untrue. Again, sort of. This conclusion showed that simple amino acids COULD be made with the right stimulus (electric current) and mixture of elements. However, these results should be taken with a grain of salt. Amino acids alone don't constitute life. (Some critics also point out that the scientists don't know the exact chemical make-up of early Earth and that he presented the case with ideal conditions, and not the chaotic conditions of early-Earth).    Again, this is based on how you define "evolution". There have been NO experiments that have shown one species change into a completely different type of organism. There also never will be because a process like that would, according to evolutionary theory, take a very, very, very, very long time. (millennia at minimum).      This is strictly my opinion:   The many, many similarities in seemingly different  organisms points to a common Creator, just as paintings with common features are attributed to a common artist. (Again, this is strictly MY OPINION)|`|HRI8BhS6aa	yes, yes, and yes......

anGiS8nDaa	Electrons are negatively charged so they want to always be as far away as possible form each other. With that being said and the given equations, calculate the   of electrons. For water there are 2Hs so thats 2 valance electron + the 6 given by the O. This now, when applied to the lewis dot diagram structure, gives us an extra pair. This lone pair of electrons will go and space itself evenly with the other 3 pairs. Now since H2O has a double bond, the electrons will space themselves in a V (bent) shape with the vertex being the O and the tips being the Hydrogens. The lone pair is also by the vertex and the other pairs will be on either side of the O. Just think of it as a circle and you have 3 poles you and to evenly space around it. Since the formula is linear by only having 3 atoms, it will be a line, yet the extra - pair will cause them to shift until they are equidistant, being a bent shape. This will also make the molecule of water polar since the O is so electronegative, it will pull the electrons closer to it than the Hs, leaving the Hs with a slight + charge and since its bent and has a lone pair that'll give the O a more - charge, making it polar.|`|mE1wChlvaa	ok so water is bent because of the two lone pairs of oxygen. the two lone pairs push down the hydrogens, making it bent instead of linear    ammonia is pyramidal because of the lone pair of the nitrogen, sulfur trioxide is trigonal planar because it doesn't have the lone pair pushing the other atoms down.    im not sure about the last one but they are probably a tetrahedral becasue there are four atoms attached to the central atom|`|AA11975244	For the first two, the other person was right. The electron repulsions introduce distortion in the basic geometry to yield a bent structure and a pyramidal structure, respectively.    The last two are tetrahedral.  CH4 is a nonpolar molecule and CH3Cl is polar. Chlorine is highly electronegative, so it will not share the electrons in the covalent bond equally with carbon.

While it is not addictive, it does have the potential to cause significant psychological damage if you have a "bad trip."  Paranoia, fear, and irrational behavior (e.g., trying to fly) should be considered as the possible alternative to hallucinating pretty colors, sensations and seeing distorted movements.

AA11312653	Fluorescent lights contain the element mercury, which can be dangerous to people and animals if not cleaned up and disposed of promptly.    You may have heard someone say "fluorescent lights are toxic to dispose of, so how can they be environmentally friendly?" Over the life of the bulb it saves a lot of energy. We use less electricity when we turn the light because these bulbs are more efficient. We use less energy to manufacture and ship replacement bulbs because they last a long long time. And we use less energy for air conditioning and cooling because these bulbs give off much less heat. The long term savings from the switch to fluorescent more than makes up for the extra cost of properly disposing of them when their useful life is over.|`|mqdkcHDFaa	I'm pretty sure that it's not too bad.

This is similar to (yet exactly the opposite of) how you suck liquid through a straw in the first place.  When you reduce the air pressure in the straw by vacuuming gas out with your mouth and lungs while the volume stays the same, the air pressure of the room acting on the surface of the liquid that the straw is immersed in is sufficient to drive the liquid against gravity up the body of the straw and into your mouth.

ja7J2cE2aa	No, and neither are any of your blood vessels.      The part of your blood that binds to oxygen is hemoglobin, and it can bind with oxygen because it contains iron.  It forms iron oxide, giving blood a reddish brown color.  Oxygenated blood is bright red, while oxygen-deprived blood is more of a rusty red.      chipmonkcheeks1's article posted as a source actually states that blood is never blue.  Read the section on hemoglobin's color carefully, it's mentioned pretty early on in that area.      The reason your blood vessels look blue under your skin is because your skin layers diffract some light.  By the time the reflected light gets through your skin layers, hits the vein, and comes back to your eyes, it's lost so much energy that it appears blue, even though the blood inside is really red.|`|SXoxEkfPaa	it's hemoglobin what makes your blood cells red.. and you can't take it out without destroying the cell. if you somehow do, i bet it would be transparent.  your veins look blue because of themselves, deoxigenized blood is still red.|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	when your blood is exposed to oxygen it turns red and when it is lacking oxygen it is blue.|`|026n1P1paa	Look at the veins in your wrist|`|3E6Kz2ygaa	your deoxygenated red blood cells are actually a dark purple-ish red.

So how many of each would you need to balance the charge?      Oxygen is one of the diatomic atoms.  So whenever you see it alone, you can assume you have O2(g), meaning oxygen gas.

zf8BnU6Yaa	If your floor joist deflects too much, then the floor which is on the joist may crack or otherwise deform, buckle, etc.  Some floors would need to be level for safety.  Suitable is a subjective statement depending upon the conditions.  But concrete structures may be strong, but if the structure deflects too much the top of the structure will be in tension and could spall which could expose the reinforcing steel.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Sure.  Strength refers to ability to withstand forces without permanent deformation (exceeding the yield strength).  But there may be additional requirements for rigidity.   For instance, floor joists are not only required ot carry the floor loading (pounds per square foot) without breaking, they are required to have less than some maximum deflection at that load.      If you enter a house where the deflection requirement was ignored, the floor may feel a bit like a trampoline.  The dishes on the table rattle when someone walks by.  And forget using an old fashioned record player and trying to dance in the same room.    --   Regards,    John Popelish
2YkEQrmvaa	I'll get you started:      p= the dominant allele  q= the recessive allele    You already know that we carry copies of each gene.  Therefore there are 3 possible genotypes: homozygous dominant: pp (or p^2), homozygous recessive: qq (or q^2), or heterozygous (pq or qp, which is 2pq)  Hense, p^2 + 2pq + q^2= 1 (the total population)    Here, we know that 36% of the population is homozygous recessive.  Therefore, q^2 = 36  now, by square rooting each side, you can find q = 6.    64% are either pp or pq      Can you figure it out from here?|`|FUVakx3yaa	Generally we let p represent the frequency of the dominant allele and q represent the frequency of the recessive allele in the population, although mathematically it doesn't matter as long you are consistent with which one you choose to represent the frequency of the dominant and recessive allele.    So, on to the problem:  if 36% are non-tasters, and assuming this is a single gene with only two alleles and assuming that the dominant allele is represented by T and the recessive allele represented by t, then the non-tasting phenotype has the genotype of tt.  If q is the frequency of the recessive allele in the population, then the probability of recessive homozygotes, tt, is the probability that two recessive alleles come together which is the product of the probabilities for each allele, meaning that:  q x q = q^2.  So, the frequency of the recessive phenotype (which has genotype tt) in the population is:    q^2 = 0.36 and so q = 0.6    Since we know that if there are only two alleles, then the sum of the frequencies of the two alleles must be one:    p + q = 1  p = 1 - q  p = 1 - 0.6  p = 0.4    So, since the frequency of the dominant homozygotes, TT, is the product of the probabilities of the two dominant alleles coming together:  p x p = p^2, so:    p^2 = 0.4 x 0.4 = 0.16    and since the frequency of heterozygotes is the sum of the two possibilities for the dominant and recessive alleles coming together:    pq + qp = 2pq    so, 2pq = 2 x 0.4 x 0.6 = 0.48    So, frequency of dominant homozygotes is 0.16, the frequency of heterozygotes is 0.48 and the frequency of recessive homozygotes is 0.36.    Note that the classic Hardy-Weinberg equation is derived from squaring the above equation:  p + q = 1  (p + q)^2 = 1^2  (p + q)^2 = 1  p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1    So, we can use this to check our math:  p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1  0.16 + 0.48 + 0.36 = 1, yes, our answers are correct.

mKBZmH1Laa	Pros: Having a number of secondary, tertiary, ... roots + adventitious roots, fibrous root system offers greater surface area for absorption of AVAILABLE nutrients.    Cons: Fibrous root system, as in that of monocots, is generally shallow-anchored which translates to high tendency of these plants to lodge (e.g. in times of typhoons, strong winds... etc.). One case for example is banana. If you're a good businessman/agriculturist, you will not establish your banana plantation in a typhoon-belt area/place visited frequently by strong winds, otherwise, come fruiting season and a typhoon come, expect to have a 90 to 100% (qualitiative/quantitative) yield loss as the banana trunk won't be able to support the heavy weight of the bunch.       Another "problem" with having shallow roots is the poor ability of these plants to tap nutrients in deeper soil horizon. Good if you have sown your plant in a fertile soil, otherwise, the plant will exhibit poor growth and development (unless you fertilizer them and/or these roots have some sort of symbiotic relationship with some microorganism, i.e. mycorrhiza, which facilitates better absorption of nutrients).|`|muOCujc2aa	pro=more water absorption from topsoil. con=lack of taproot means less stability|`|ZahjlUioaa	Pros: creates less of a soil erosion Con: hard to get rid of it.
SvmZlLdaaa	Absolutely. I find it both ridiculous and arrogant to suggest that of all the thousands upon thousands of animals on this planet, we are the only ones in which emotions have evolved. They are an important survival trait - for example, when a zebra runs from a lion, it is displaying fear. Without this emotion, the zebra would just stand there and get eaten - not a good strategy for the survival of the species. If a mother animal felt nothing for her young, she would not try to defend them when they were threatened - again, not good for the future of the species. For social animals, bonding with other members of their group is clearly important. Many social animals are known to mourn when a member of the group dies. Grey wolves mate for life, and there are known cases in which when one partner dies, the other stops eating until it too dies. This behaviour has also been seen in their descendants, domestic dogs - there are many records of dogs 'pining away' after the death of their owners.    Anyone who's ever had a pet or spent any serious time around animals will tell you that they have emotions. If they didn't, they wouldn't all have different personalities - if they were just mindless automatons responding to instinct, all individuals of the same species would react the same way to stimuli, and this is blatantly not the case. If you placed ten dogs in a room and exposed them to a loud noise, you'd be likely to get ten different reactions - one might bark, one might try to hide, one might look for the source of the sound, etc.    In my opinion, all vertebrate animals have emotions. However, I doubt that more primitive animals such as jellyfish or sponges have emotions - emotions require a complex brain, something these species do not possess.|`|Xpd9v2lvaa	They have feelings, though as they are not as social as humans they are not as complex.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Of course they do, they are living beings like the rest of us.

If a human abuses a dog, it gets the idea that humans are there to hurt them, and therefore shy away, or bite because of INSTICTS...not emotions  They do not tuck their tail between their legs because they know they are in trouble, they do so because a survival mechanism  in their head tells them that the situation is potentially hazardous to them based on past experience. Plants definately do not have feelings. The movement exhibited by some plants on touch is a chemical reaction.

Animals do not have feelings.|`|PSiNv7gUaa	Animals do not have "feelings" or "emotions" like humans do.  Many may have complex social interactions, but these are not emotions.  For example, dogs are a pack animal.  If you own a dog, you are part of its pack, and if you expect that dog to be obedient, you assert yourself as the leader of the pack.  The way the dog reacts to you in different situtations is the same as it would to the leader of an actual pack of dogs, it is instinct that goes back to their ancestry with wolves.  Tell me this, if animals have emotions, and can love us, then how do you explain such sweet pets attacking their human owners all the time?  It's because with all your human love, you still can't squash instinct.    As for what you're saying, animals are intelligent, and can be conditioned to react to certain situations in certain ways.  If you hit your dog, you are conditioning it to fear you.  If you treat your dog kindly, you are conditioning it to be calm and obedient, although it still might attack you for no reason at any given time, as in, challenge you for leadership of the pack perhaps (which goes back to ANIMAL INSTINCT, not human emotion).|`|D0i0RDmraa	They do have feelings.Brain waves,their reactions etc. can tell us that.Primates for example,bares their fangs when their angry or annoyed,wolves put their tails between their legs when they meet another wolf in the pack that is of the higher rank.If they don't have feelings they won't feel scared and if they won't feel scared,do predators need to even chase their prey?Animals also have self conscious(which means they know that they themself exist) An experiment was carried out,the researchers painted a red dot on the elephant's forehead and a mirror is placed near it.It reacted by using it's trunk to touch it's forehead and then the red dot's reflection on the mirror.|`|ST7WcWfsaa	Animals do have feelings.

TpqWWZJNaa	Wow, that is one heck of a problem.  I think I've got it.  You need several skills in order to answer this question, you need to know how to get percent composition of NaCl and LiCl.      Start by getting percent composition of LiCl.  Do this in several steps.  First, add Li's mass (6.941)to Cl's (35.453)mass... should give you 42.394 g.  % Li is lithium's mass divided by that total you just calculated and multiplied by 100.(roughly 16.37%)% Cl = chlorine's mass over that combined total of 42.394 then multiplied by 100 to get a percent.(83.63)    Once you have the percent of Cl you need to change it back into a decimal and multiply by 245, that should tell you how many g of the 245 are actually contributed by Cl ions.  (.8363 * 245 = 204.8935g Cl)  Take that number of g of Cl and turn it into moles of Cl by dividing by 35.453 g.  204.8935 g Cl x (1 mol Cl/ 35.453 g Cl) = 5.779 mol Cl    Now you know what amount of moles of Cl you're looking for.      Now calculate the percent composition of NaCl in the same manner as you calculated the percent composition of LiCl.    Add Na's mass to Cl's mass to get your total (22.990+35.453)  Find percent Cl by dividing chlorine's mass by that total and multiplying by 100 to get a percent (that last part, multiplying by 100 isn't really necessary b/c you actually need the decimal percent)    Take the decimal percent you get and set up an equation that looks like this:    204.8935 g = x (decimal percent of Cl)    The x value is the amount of g of NaCl that will be equal to having the same number of g of Cl as LiCl had (204.8935g).    If you get the same number of Cl grams and changed to moles and changed from those moles to atoms (or ions) you would get the same number of Cl ions.      That was fun.  Long, but fun.

f1beDbKIaa	I don't think it's going to work as a career.  But let's say that you get a PhD in astrophysics, and study meteors.  What you'll want to do is collect some data.  So, you'd go out and look, right?    Wrong.  What you'd do is set up cheap web cams with fish eye lenses and record meteors from several locations automatically.  You'd write software that scans the data and records where meteors came from, where they went, how bright they were, and so on.  You might also fly high in the atmosphere and record them from there.  But mostly, you'd fly a desk.    I doubt that there are any professionals who have made meteors a full time task.  It's frankly a job for amateurs.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	If you wish to do it for just a hobby, then you must get up after midnight and stay up until about 30 min until dawn.  The earth travels through space, and the leading side isn't where you are until 3am to 9am.  After 5am is too bright a sky, so you will have to look before that.  Before midnight is not as good, since you will be on the side or back of the earth as it flies around the sun and rotates on its axis as the same time.  There are always sporadic or random meteors that approach from other directions than head on, but those are more infrequent.  Daytime ones (I saw a bright one at 11am once) are very rare.  The best meteor shower used to be the Leonid in mid November.  But it has become a less dense.  The Perseid shower in August is pretty steady and nice.  there are a few others worth mentioning:  02/08 peak out of 2 wks activity (much less before peak and after peak), Alpha Centaurids for southern skies, 5/hr  03/13 peak out of 2 wks, Gamma Normids for southern skies, 4/hr  04/22 peak out of 7 days, Lyrids up to 90/hr, but variable  04/23 peak out of 2 wks, Pi Puppids for southern skies, 40/hr maybe on the few showers seen last 30 yrs  05/05 peak out of 3 wks, Eta Aquarids, up to 60/hr  05/08 peak out of 9d, Eta Lyrids, 3/hr  06/07 peak out of 2wks, Arietids, near earths equator just before dawn, uncertain frequency, lots of radio observations  06/15 peak out of 10d, June Lyrids, 1-5/hr variable  06/27 peak out of 10d, June Bootids, 50-100/hr  (Several small ones in July)  08/12 peak in 7d, Perseids, 100/hr or more  (skipping to Nov)  11/16 or 17 peak out of 6d, Leonids, 2-30/hr.  In 1966, I stayed up all night on roof of my college science building with one other.  We saw scores until they came too fast to count at 4am.  Stopped dead at 6am. Estimated maximum about 9-15 per second or 30-50,000/hr.  Most were faint yellow, very quick, with several bluish-white, brighter than Moon, leaving trail of green sparks.

AA10927246	In the first step, when you factored out -1, it should be:  -1(x - 2) / (x2 - 2x + 1)    But even if you did that, there is a mistake when "canceling" the (x - 2).  x-2 would have to multiply the whole denominator, not just part of it.  You can't cancel.    There really isn't any reducing you can do and you should just stop at the beginning step, if you ask me.|`|V5tEz5ZWaa	no it isn't between the second and third step when you can't remove an x because the 1 doesn't have an x to remove from it|`|xllv03V8aa	no it is not . u can't cancel out (x+2) cuz in the bottom u still have +1 which is attached to the x(x-2). so not valid|`|e9BQ4GBZaa	No, for two reasons.    First, you can't cancel (x+2) and (x-2) over division. In order to cancel in the numerator and the denominator, they need to be exactly the same.    Second, you can't cancel (x-2) from the denominator like that. If you want to cancel, you need to cancel it from _all_ terms in the denominator, so you would need to cancel an (x-2) from both the x(x-2) and the 1. Since you can't divide 1 by (x-2) evenly, you can't cancel it.

AA11975244	basically you ask yourself two different questions: how much NaCl does 2.5 ml of NaOH make? and how much NaCl does 2 mol of HCl make? Once you do the calculations, then whichever one makes less is your limiting reagent.    the calculations should look like this:  2.5 mol NaOH x 1 mol NaCl/1mol NaOH x molar mass NaCl/1 mol NaCl    This type of calculation is called dimensional analysis. Basically all of your units just have to cancel out.|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	1. pick a product to convert to. for example i pick NaCl    2. take each reactant and convert to the product you picked  EX: 2 mol HCl X ( 1mol NaCl / 1mol HCl) = 2mol NaCl   2.5 mol NaOH X ( 1mol NaCl / 1mol NaOH) = 2.5mol NaCl  {the ratio in the parenthesis is the ration given in the equation}    3. the reactant that makes the least product is the limiting reactant  ANSWER: HCl is the limiting reactant because it only produces 2mol NaCl while NaOH produces 2.5mol NaCl.    4. if you want to take it a step further and find how many grams of NaCl you would get, you find the limiting reactant and the number of moles produced of the product and multiply by the molar mass.  EX:2mol HCl X ( 1mol NaCl / 1mol HCl) = 2mol NaCl*limiting*  2.5 mol NaOH X ( 1mol NaCl / 1mol NaOH) = 2.5mol NaCl   2mol NaCl X (49.46g NaCl / 1mol NaCl) = 98.92g NaCl produced.

When there is an excess of electrons, the object is said to be negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than protons, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can acquire charge through rubbing, by the phenomenon of triboelectricity. Electrons and positrons can annihilate each other and produce a pair of photons. However, high-energy photons may transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production.

5a1bed48cc8be0df0858bcd418448089aa	For question 1 I would use the cosine rule. Then it's just a case of finding the appropriate angle opposite the length you need to find.    Cosine rule:    a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - b*c*cos(A)    Since you start of at 69 degrees (I chose to look at it as 69 degrees from the + x-direction then at the top of this leg it can be viewed as 180 + 69 degrees = 249 degrees. The second leg is at 295 degrees. So the angle between these is 295 - 249 = 46 degrees.    So in the above equation    a is the length your after, b=4, c=5 and A = 46 degrees    so square-rooting both sides and putting in the numbers will give you the answer in nautical miles.    The other questions look similar, but I've not tried them.

If both powers of sin and cos are even you need to resort to using trig identities: A) cos(x)^2 = ((1+cos 2x)/2) or B) sin(x)^2 = ((1-cos 2x)/2)  So the solution goes like this (ignoring the 35):  (1/4)  sin(2x)^2 dx = (1/8)  (1- cos (4x))dx   (1/8) (x -(1/4) sin(4x) + C = 1/8x - 1/32 sin (4x) + C    I would also recommend that you keep this handy somewhere as you are going to need it:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trig_identi...

QVDJSHzjaa	In general, a large magnet is spun within a large set of coils.  The changing field from the spinning magnet creates generates electricity within the copper coils.  This electricity is then transmitted to businesses and your house.    What turns the large magnet?  That's where the original work comes into play.  Coal is burned in a large boiler.  Heat from the coal is used to superheat water to steam.  Pressure from the steam is then released into a turbine.  The turbine is basically a many-bladed fan.  The turbine spins (rotates) from the steam pressure.  The turbine is directly tied to the magnet on one end.    So, heat from coal is turned into steam pressure.  That pressure is used to rotate a turbine which rotates a magnet within a copper coil.  The rotation of the magnet generates electricity.    Various other types of fuels are used to generate electricity.  Oil, and natural gas can be fired to make the steam.  Natural gas can also be directly fired into a gas turbine.  The expansion of the flames are used to rotate the turbine.  Nuclear energy plants use nuclear fission to generate the steam.|`|pjDC1pkPaa	Electricity is never created only the energy transfers that take place within the cell to give the coulombs of charge energy to give equaly to each component is what happens|`|f2uqEIksaa	energy transfer caused by friction when a magnet turns while adjacent to a wire completely surrounding it|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	There are these big electric generators.  Inside them are magnets which induce currents in electric wires when the magnets move with respect to the wires.  The spinning magnets are moved by attaching them to a shaft which is then connected to a turbine.  The turbine is spun by the force of falling water (like in a dam) or by wind or by steam (water in vapor phase which is produced by heating water by burning coal or other fossil fuel or by nuclear reactions).
zdu3gh8jaa	Have you learned how to protect, ground, and cleanse your own energy system (aura,chakras etc)? Before learning to take your 'developing self' further I would advise that you look at your own energy and get used to working with that.   I would not be learning to 'read' minds but learning to 'read' the energy of the auric field, it is amazing just how accurate your findings can be.  As for talking with/seeing spirit, could I suggest that you speak with someone from spiritualist church. The people there will not think you are strange in any way and can help you develop safely in this area. Could I also suggest psychometry. This is were you read the energy of objects and whatnot without knowing the history behind them.   Everything that I have suggested can help you develop your self further.

XGw7pu4Raa	Your description sounds more like a giant water bug, or 'toe-biter'.  These true bugs are in the family Belostomatidae and use their large fore-legs to capture fish, frogs and other aquatic critters.  These bugs suck the blood and body fluids from their prey.  Beetles on the otherhand would most likely tear off pieces of flesh and eat them with their biting chewing mouth parts.    Check out some pictures of 'giant water bug' on google to see if this is your critter.  If so the Wikipedia page below is a good place to start for ideas for your paper.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	Water beetle?
N9CtBJnnaa	yes, but realistically speaking, they shouldn't exist. they are the product of human controlled inter-breeding between animal, or "playing god".  as tigers mainly live in asia, and lions inhabit africa, the chances are that they will never come across each other in the wild. even if they did, they are more likely to fight than reproduce.|`|ZKikquiOaa	Yes they're real and they're big.  But not just because they come from two big cats, but because the gene that inhibit growth in both the tiger and the lion doesn't get passed down when they're crossbred.|`|9p7eUgYqaa	Yes|`|XXXtYowRaa	the top answer is wrong a tigon is different to a liger they are usually smaller and have a differeent coat. yes ligers are real they are they largest big cats alive today you can find more about them on wikipidia on google.|`|eiim3tJuaa	Yes, they are a hybrid animal.

Ligers can also be called tigons or tiglons. I think the first syllable depends on the paternity (whether the lion or the tiger was the father)|`|SvmZlLdaaa	Yes, they are the offspring of a male lion and female tiger. The offspring of a male tiger and female lion is called a tigon. Ligers tend towards gigantism and are generally larger than either of their parents, whilst tigons are generally smaller or at least no larger than their parents. Like most hybrids, both are usually sterile, but occasionally a female will be fertile and can be bred back to a male lion or tiger, producing:    Lion + liger = li-liger  Lion + tigon = li-tigon  Tiger + liger = ti-liger  Tiger + tigon = ti-tigon    Respectable zoos frown on the breeding of hybrids such as ligers and tigons, as they have no value from a conservation point of view and are taking up space and resources that could be used to breed endangered species. They are basically freaks bred by unscrupulous zoos in order to make money out of people willing to pay to see them. Today, there is very little chance of them occurring in the wild - tigers are found only in Asia, lions in Africa and the Gir Forest of India, where there are no tigers. Historically, the Asiatic subspecies of lion had a much greater range which overlapped with that of the tiger, so it is possible, though unlikely, that they may once have sometimes occurred in the wild.    Liger:  http://www.liger.org/images/liger-pic.jp...    Tigon:  http://www.tiger-online.org/tigbib/bigca...|`|iYZRZg5Zaa	Yeah, Ligers are real.  Ligers are offsprings of male lions and female tigers.  Tigons are animals that have a tiger for a father and a lion for a mother.  Ligers have a lion for a dad and a tiger for a mom.  Tigons and ligers are really big, probably because they're offsprings of the biggest cats of the big cat family.

We can look out in all directions and see that the visible universe ends at the same distance everywhere, now if you read that in a literal sense it means we are right in the center of the visible universe.  If you look at the red shifts of other galaxies out there, they are all accelerating directly (nearly) away from us, again showing that we are right in the middle of the visible universe.    This is, however, an optical illusion.      You see, light can only move so fast.  I'm sure you have heard that nothing can move faster than the speed of light, and while that is true, it is also incomplete.  Light cannot move through SPACE faster than the speed of light.  The acceleration of the universe is actually caused by SPACE getting larger, not the objects inside of it.  During the initial time after the big bang, the universe was expanding faster than the speed of light, and because of that, it is almost certain that there are galaxies out there that are so far away that light hasn't had time to reach us yet, and in some cases they are far enough away that they never will (not in a trillion billion years).    So...  That means that we really have no idea where in the universe we are.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	In the center.
k5Ece8BTaa	Well, you don't need to be afraid of 2012, because your fears are based upon nothing.     This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.  ? No comment will hit Earth.  ? If you have been watching the History Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.  ? We are going to have a rare night sky, nothing more. No asteriods, no comments, etc.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this.

According to the Bible,there is no possible way  to tell when the world will end and nobody knows when God will come back. This world is not our home anyways,God just put us here so that he could get heaven ready for us. If you have God in your heart and accept Jesus as your personal Saviour you have nothing to worry about. The key is to have God in your heart. You have to have Him. Once your a Christian and have God in your heart ask Him to take all your fear away. Pray to Him to forgive you of your sins everyday. There is nothing to worry about if you have God in your heart. :)|`|AKfZDADmaa	No way. it is probably going to end in like the year of 5000 or something. It is impossible to end at 2012.

U311MeRNaa	nuclear defence satellites come in 2 forms, the first is a monitoring station, it is a low earth orbit device that is literally a spy Satellite, looking for anything unusual (not just nukes, but anything it is instructed to look at)    the second stage is the defence mechanism, nicely displayed in the james bond film goldeneye. it is a nuclear bomb aboard a Satellite that when exploded in low earth orbit will create an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) this stops all electric circuits from working within a nuclear missile and thus it crashes harmlessly, unable to arm itself without the electronics.    as for the enterprise shuttle, i like the full story above, very accurate, but one tiny thing he missed. the shuttle enterprise never flew in space, but it did atmospheric test flights by remote control and it could not have been upgraded for space flights as the design of the enterprise was changed during construction and it was too flimsy to be used in a pressurised environment (that's why, when challenger was lost, they built endeavour out of spare parts, rather than upgrade enterprise to do the job).    gave you a thumbs up though doom shepherd as you are correct|`|qDYzdz5daa	"Star Trek" was a TV show, and thusly cannot complain, being inanimate.    Now, here's the story about Star Trek and the shuttle.    Back when the shuttle was first being built, a bunch of Star Trek fans petitioned NASA to name the first shuttle "Enterprise" after the Star Trek ship.    They succeeded.      However, the shuttle Enterprise was built as a test model, and was not able to fly.  It was originally going to be rebuilt into a shuttle that could fly, but NASA decided it was cheaper to upgrade a different shuttle test model, which became the shuttle Challenger.    The Enterprise never flew in space, and almost certainly never will, now.  This was disappointing to Star Trek fans, but really kind of ironic.    You see, if they hadn't petitioned NASA, then the first shuttle would have been named "Constitution"  (which was also the class name of the Star Trek "Enterprise," and  - according to fiction - the first Star Trek Enterprise-type ship built.  As a test.)    One of the other shuttles, ones that actually flew, would then probably have been named Enterprise anyway.    Which is kind of funny.  The fans may have sabotaged themselves.    (I'm afraid I can't help much with the second part of your question.  next time, break them up into 2 questions.)|`|110fda6e94f73c2bbaae8136ca9a20ddaa	Your first paragraph belongs in the television topic--     Your second paragrah refers to our missile defense "shield".

TMB4d3FAaa	It is as if it is again early spring to them. All winter the tops lay dormant. They have the food supply from the previous year.  In summer the tree is storing some of all that energy it is photosynthesizing. If the leaves are torn off or eaten by insects they have enough energy stored to rebuild their factory. Of course there is a critical amount of energy they must maintain to survive.  Several bad bouts can kill the tree if it can't store up enough energy to send out new leaves.  The stems and branches with green can also photosynthesize to help out.  With no leaves they are back in direct sunlight and can go wide open. Some desert trees will lose their leaves on purpose so they wonl' continue to lose water during times of severe drought.  As soon as it rains they sprout new leaves. It is one of the genetic stategies that have developed over the eons to aid in the survival of specific trees.  The maples in Indiana are getting ready to run sap.  The flowers will come out and be wind fertilized because its to cold for bees yet.  The sap will feed the flowers so they can develop their seeds.  Then when they are fertilized, the leaves will pop out and the photosynthetic process will sour the sweet sap with nutriants.  Because, it happens when the leaves "bud" out it is said to have a buddy taste. When the leaves appear the tree begins storing energy for next spring and the new flowers and seeds.  Thats how the tree survives the loss of leaves.|`|I6KdUbZxaa	becuz the use light independent photosynthesis when they don't have leaves|`|743f401bac126bdc42eda174751e5d3caa	Young stem tissues are photosynthetic.

2lQ8DJAcaa	If animals have been going extinct ever since there were animals, what's all the worry about? The worry is that the rate of extinction we humans are causing is among the worst the earth has ever witnessed. Sure, the earth recovered from the mass extinctions that have occurred beforebut only after millions of years.  There are many ways that humans are pushing animals towards extinction, but the three biggest ways are:  1. Habitat Destruction  Humans take up a lot of room. Roads, parking lots, fields for grazing cattle, and yards all take up lots of space that used to be home for animals.  Think it's hard to cross the street sometimes? Imagine trying to cross if you were as small as a mouse or as slow as a turtle. Roads also divide the wilderness into sections and make it hard for animals to move around. If animals can't move around, they can run out of food faster, have a harder time finding mates, and die away.  People used to think that the swampy land along many coasts and rivers was a waste. After all, people couldn't build houses on it, so what good was it? We have learned that these "wetlands" are sanctuaries for hundreds of species of insects, mollusks, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. In fact, about half of the animals listed as either threatened or endangered depend on wetlands. Destroying wetlands pushes many animals towards extinction.    2. Introduction of Foreign Species  3. Overexploitation|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	How about polar bears?

STI2L7ojaa	Shyguy and Stephd are correct.     All cells originate from stem cells, which have the capacity to become any type of cell. Also, all of your cells contain all of the DNA used to make up the entire organism. When it is time for them to mature, they will recieve signals that tell them to express (transcribe) certain gene segments of the DNA that will make them into the type of cell they are meant to be, depending on their location.     The entire process is called differentiation.|`|nCrSOm9vaa	They receive signals telling them to express those particular genes, and not others.|`|67fc0c30125bac036c6df15bb7b4e5c3aa	Its called: Differentiation|`|RCK7H7Guaa	It is etched in ones DNA and they are to be what ever they are to be.

R7kk39sTaa	Differential rate laws contain only the reactants in the expression. The order must be determined by experiment.    R = k [P(HBr)]^n, where k is the rate constant, P(HBr) is the partial pressure of HBr, and n = the order.    R = k [P(SO2)]^m x [P(O2)]^n    R = k [P(NO)]^m x [P(H2)]^n    Partial pressures are used in the above rate laws because all the reactants are gases. The [ ] does not mean molarity in this case.

YYLybWHSaa	Hybrids are not always born sterile, fertile crosses occur in some species depending on how different the species are from each other.    Waterfowl are more prone to hybridization than other avian species and most of the known hybrids are domestic or captive birds that cross. The Mallard has about 50 known possible crosses with other duck & geese species. In the wild hybrid Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)/American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes) have been found to be 8% to 13% of the tagged Mallards and Black Ducks.  http://mypage.direct.ca/w/writer/ducks.h...  http://www.harteman.nl/omnibus/hybrids/i...    Canid hybrids occur between coyotes, wolves, dingos, jackals and domestic dogs.  http://www.wildlifetech.com/pages/necoyo...  http://www.fmv.ulg.ac.be/genmol/Departme...  http://www.idir.net/~wolf2dog/wayne2.htm    Evidence for historic hybrids  http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20... - bx269216B2    However plants produce fertile hybrids very readily. According to Loren Rieseberg, a botanist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, around 14 per cent of living plant species are the product of two separate lineages hybridizing.     Most domestic garden plants such as the fuchsia are derived from an array of species hybredized for interesting traits. Many are crossed with Fuchsia magellanica, and to a lesser extent, F. regia but other species such as F. fulgens & F. splendens are present also.  http://www2.dicom.se/fuchsias/pictureshy...     The domesticated cultivars  of Gerbera daisies are mostly a result of a cross between Gerbera jamesonii and Gerbera viridifolia. In plants it is often tagged by something like Gerbera hybrid "Multicolor" or Gerbera X when being marketed as a hybrid. Plants that are hybrids are listed with an x after the genus name. This tells you it is a cross within that genus but doesn't specify the two parent species, probably because it is not known.|`|7iSfizwhaa	In most places the parents or the police would put a stop to such behavior; however, I've heard it's still acceptable in some parts of the Deep South.|`|wl85WhsTaa	well I don't think they do breed.

No animal is friendly.  Only humans can be friends.  Remember a couple years ago Sigfried and Roy and their supposed tame tiger?  Well, just keep that in mind as you venture in to contact with any wild animal.    One thing you should be careful about.  Exposed skin.  Shark skin is rough and maybe abrasive.  You don't wanna suffer an unintentional minor injury, especially one that may bleed.  It does not matter that nurse sharks are bottom feeders.  They will still react to the scent of blood.

95c13f8327c79bfed7fe604af52bd1dcaa	A mutation in sex cells (sperm/egg) is more significant because the mutation may be passed to the offspring, thus affecting an entire organism (because all of the offspring's cells are derived from a single cell and will have the mutation).

TL1Jkqunaa	There is radiation above and below the spectrum we see.  SOme animals are very good at seeing them.  Pit viper snakes see into infrared, it would be as if we could directly see heat but notice that we do not perceive heat as a color.  Pit vipers do see heat in a way.    Where we see white flowers many insects see flowers of many colors and patterns moving into the ultraviolet range.  You can look at photos of these plants where the spectrum has been shifted so we can get an idea of what bees see when they see these white flowers.  The shift puts the colors into the range we see but they are not the colors the insects see.  Since we can't see these colors they go unnamed.    There are cases of people who can see a little farther into the infrared and ultraviolet ranges, but not much.  The problem of seeing new colors isn't that they do not exist, they do,  but we haven't the capacity to see them.  SO they all get lumped together as electromagnetic radiation with subdivisions that we can use.  Radio, x-ray gamma ray and so on.|`|vHxauOyeaa	Nope... we got em all.   due to the fact that we have sets of colors that make up other colors thereby defining the visible light spectrum... if other colors existed we wouldn't know if of course, but odds are really against that.|`|0kjWE73qaa	That's a cool question but we'll never know until we see them.

If one looks at a spectrum cast by a beam of white light through a prism, apparently there are no colors beyond red on one end and violet on the other.  Yet we know that there are light rays there, due to the effects on objects in those rays.  So the next "color" after red is infrared and the next "color" after violet is ultraviolet.    It becomes a matter of definition of "color".  Our conventional defintion of color restricts it to those light ray frequencies that eyes can perceive.  However, another and equally valid definition of color would be "any frequency of photonic energy" thus making the entire spectrum of light run clear from Long Wave Radio all the way up to Gamma Rays.  That would be a fantastic rainbow with quadrillions fo colors!    That is the closest that we humans will get to undiscovered colors.

Will we be able to "see" these colors? no, because the human eye only has receptors for light waves in the visible spectrum I noted above. Just like we can't see infrared light or ultraviolet light, unless we use special equipment, which really isn't the same as "seeing" them.
STI2L7ojaa	Depending on the level of detail you need, this question could be very, very complicated.    On a basic level, here it is:    The heart is the central pump that forces blood outwards to the periphery of your circulatory system. Within the heart, there are 4 chambers. The blood coming from the body first enters the right atrium, which contracts to pump the blood into the right ventricle. Contraction of the right ventricle pushes the blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where gas exchange occurs in the alveoli. The blood is now oxygen-rich. Pulmonary veins carry blood to the left atrium, which pumps it into the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the blood out through the aorta and into the arteries leading all over your body. The arteries branch, getting smaller and smaller (called arterioles now) until they reach the tissues they are supplying blood to. The vessels are now tiny, and are capillaries. The capillary beds allow gas exchange to occur again, as well as picking up cell waste and dropping off nutrients for the cell. On the other side of the capillary beds the vessels are called veins. Blood in the veins is pumped not by the heart, but by contraction of the surrounding muscles. Veins have multiple one-way valves along them that make sure blood can't flow backwards down your body between muscular contractions. The veins coming from your lower body join to form the inferior vena cava, and your upper body's form the superior vena cava, both of which empty into the right atrium.     There's a lot more to it than that in terms of details, but I hope that helps.

I0XEVeUxaa	Gasoline distributors usually pass taxes on to their customers.  So if the average price of gasoline is $2.57 / gal and taxes increase 10%, so will the average.  Expect it to be $2.57 + 10% (.257) = $2.83 / gal.    Now what about the variation (std dev)?  Consider that the standard deviation is a percentage of the mean:  $0.20 / $2.57 = 7.8%.  This actually known as the "coefficient of variation" (CV).    The CV is likely to always be the same for any average.  Thus the standard deviation will be 7.8% of 2.83 = $0.22 / gal.  Thus the standard deviation increased by $0.02 /gal.    That is actually a 10% increase in the standard deviation too:  0.20 + 10% = 0.22.

The photon is not an atom, its a light quanta.   Actually, its a quanta of the electromagnetic field.  If for some reason you knew you had 1 mole of photons (which would have a mass of exactly 0g, which in turn means you can't know you have a mole of photons in the classical chemistry sense of why you use the unit of mole), you would simply multiply the energy per photon (your 5.52e-19 J) by Avogadro's number.   But, there is no reason you would ever want to perform this calculation because it is a completely useless concept.

QNyztmU3aa	One strategy "strictly dominates" another strategy if its payoffs are at least as high regardless of what your opponent does.  In your example, player 1's first strategy is strictly dominated by his/her second strategy.  If player 2 chooses his/her first strategy, then player 1 gets 2 for using strategy 2 and -1 for using strategy 1; if player 2 chooses his/her second strategy the respective payoffs are both 1; and if player 2 chooses the third strategy then the respective payoffs are 1 and 0.  In each case, player 1 does at least as well using the second strategy compared to the first.  So when you think about it, it would be foolish for player 1 to ever choose the first strategy because the second strategy is never worse, and in fact it is better if player 2 chooses his or her first or third strategy.  So you can just cross off the first row.  The matrix becomes:    (2, 1)  (1, 2)   (1,3)  (-3, 0) (-1, -2) (2, -2)  (1, 1)  (2, -2)  (-1, 3)    Now let's look at things from the second player's choices.  It looks like he or she has no incentive to ever choose the second strategy: no matter what player 1 does, he or she would be at least as well off using the third strategy (3 > 2, -2 = -2, 3 > -2).  So we can cross off the second column and get:    (2, 1)  (1, 3)  (-3, 0) (2, -2)  (1, 1)  (-1, 3)    Returning to the first player's perspective, we can now eliminate the third strategy because it is strictly dominated by the first strategy.  So the matrix becomes:    (2, 1)  (1, 3)  (-3, 0) (2, -2)    Now the matrix is as small as it can get - the relative desirability of each choice genuinely depends on the opponent's choice.    When you solve this kind of problem, just be careful to remember that when you are comparing rows you have to use the first number in each entry and when you are comparing columns you have to use the second (that is the standard convention anyway),

Xaffu60Waa	basically, treat i like its a variable. You do the calculations like any other problem, but keeping your imaginary numbers separate from your real numbers.    1. 4 - 6 = -2  -5i + i = -6i (remember to distribute the negative -(6-i) = -6 +i )    so the answer is -2 - 5i    when you have i to a power, you can simplify it down to 1, -1, i, or -i. This is because:   i^1 = i  i^2 = -1  i^3 = i^2 * i = -i  i^4 = i^2 *i^2 = 1    i^5 = i^4 *i = 1* i  i^6 = i^4 * i^2 = 1*-1 = -1  i^7 = i^-4 *i^3 = 1*-i = -i  etc....    So for number 4, 2 goes into 922 461 times. this means that:  i^922 = (i^2)^461  well, i^2 is -1, so this is the same as:  (-1)^461  since 461 is odd, the answer is -1.

AA11432707	It depends on your particular case. (I'm assuming you're referring to an inguinal hernia, which is intestines slipping down into the scrotum)    Hernias can be small, or huge, and that can make a difference in the extent of the surgery and your recovery.  Sometimes the procedure is done with a scope, and sometimes as an open procedure.  Many times, mesh is sewn in to strengthen the abdominal wall and prevent recurrences.    All surgery involves some discomfort, but you'll get pain medication during the surgery and afterward.    Your alternative is to wear a truss.  It's usually a good idea to get the hernia fixed while it is relatively small. If some intestines get caught in there they can get stuck permanently, which makes it a bigger operation to fix it.  If the blood supply to those intestines is squeezed off, it becomes a surgical emergency, and you might need to have bowel resected and that's a pretty big deal.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	i know someone older than 60 that had both done and he was up and about in no time, as for pain not sure as everyone is different. good luck

The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar.

December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY civilizations. And that's ALL.

In general, this is because adding 1 to something running through all the integers just shifts the results by one integer, but gives the same set.    If you want to derive it:  Let n be the middle even number. Then n = 2k for some integer k.  The sum of three consecutive integers can then be expressed as S = n - 2 + n + n + 2 = 3n = 6k.  Therefore, every number that is the sum of three consecutive even integers has the form 6k for some integer k.  All the possible ones are { 6k | k is an integer}.

eStGTWPGaa	Ok, first what is mass and what is weight.  Mass is the mass of every little component of the body (or object) and it does not change if it is on the ground, under the sea or in the space. And it is measured by gram, kilogram, ton etc but gram is the basic unit.  Weight on the other hand is the force of the gravity of the earth (or any planet) usually the earth is our reference in computations. And the wight can be varies for the same object from place to place. e.g. You may weight 200 newton at your city, but if you weight yourself in different city might be different, because the gravity is not equally on the surface of the earth (position and the height). Weight measurement unit is Newton.  There are other interesting compassion between the two but lets get back to ur question.    This animal mass is 20 grams so its mass is 20 grams everywhere.  But it's weight might vary depending on it's position on the surface of the earth. However the general gravity acceleration = 9.8 m/sec^2  We use this number as if the object on the sea surface level.    So the weight = mass * gravity acceleration (G)                       = 20 gr (1/1000) * 9.8                       = 0.196 nt    Hope this helped  ~~Edit, sorry didn't see the pound thing.  pound is another unit in the english standard to represent mass.  20 gram = 20/1000 = 0.02 kilo  Mass in pound = mass in kilos *2.2                            = 0.02 * 2.2 = 0.044 pound  But the weight as described in newton, u don't use pound.|`|Q32FbbeFaa	i dont get it|`|PVfV1a8Kaa	20 grams = 0.0440924524 pounds    That's also the mass.|`|tq8VGqSEaa	0.04 pounds|`|rbgjc62Raa	20 grams is the mass.

iUM1h6Yjaa	The way you describe it, it sounds like she's having seizures. Seizures have a medical cause and can indicate a serious condition. If she's not faking this for attention then she needs immediate care from a physician. Don't jeopardize your friend's health by telling her it's paranormal or something silly like that.|`|OkPDVfh6aa	FOR PETE'S SAKE!! Tell her NOT  to communicate with them!! Maybe if she ignores them ..they'll stop. She really could be having seizures. Please beg her to go to the dr. and be checked for them. You didn't say exactly if she sees the spirits before or during the black out. If it's during..then it could be a seizure and she could be hallucinating. This isn't supposed to happen normally. It might seem "fascinating"..but she could be putting herself in danger... esp. her brain. I worked with the cerebral palsy handicapped and some of them had seizures. Please google seizures and compare it to what she is going through.|`|R9hgZpbZaa	she can only be saved through Jesus, go to a church and tell the priests and tell them.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I agree that I'd have her checked out by a doctor, just to rule that out...     But otherwise... the blacking out... is normal if you're a channeler. I have a friend this happens to a lot. she needs to learn spiritual protection. First and best thing is white light. Tell her to close her eyes and envision pure, blinding white light coming down from the sky (to me, it's God's light, but if you're not religious at all, it doesn't have to be God's light, just needs to be white). It will come down into the top of her head, straight down through her feet and into the ground. Then I always see it filling my body then pushing outwards and filling my aura, until I'm standing in an egg of light. It will surround her completely,  aura included, including below the ground.     Another way is the violet flame--http://thevioletflame.tripod.com/    Tell her to protect daily and right before any activity. Tell her to white light her house as well.     The ones that make her ill... that would make me nervous. I'd tell them to go, in the name of christ if she's religious at all. And then I'd call ARchangel Michael to escort it away from my home. In fact, anytime she doesn't feel right, have her call Michael.     It would be wise for her to get to know her spirit guides as well. They'll protect her. Tell her to protect herself first, light a few white candles, and ask that her guides come forward. Tell her to make sure she specifically asks that ONLY her truest guides, with the purest intent, be allowed to come forward. And ONLY do this AFTER she and the house are protected. She could even ask that archangel michael bring her guide forward to her.     tell her to trust her gut, and that she is ALWAYS in charge.     Another protective chant I used to use. say this at least  three times, but can be said until she begins to feel safe again: "I ask archangel Michael for the full body armor of the violet flame, the omega balance sheild, the triple white light of Christ, and the invisible cloak of light."    it's very powerful. It's michael's armor combined with the violet flame.     good luck|`|9hC5zE64aa	She learned about ghost and spirit from her early years from her parents and grandparents and from some religious books.

cHhEC9fpaa	The resistance of a wire, of resistivity rho is    R= rho l/A     where l is the length and A is the cross-sectional area. The volume of the wire is l x A. Let's eliminate A in favor of l and V (constant).    R = rho l^2/V.     If the wire is stretched, the resistance goes up.     From our previous result the ratio of resistances (R1 initial; R2 final) is     R2/R1 = (l2/l1)^2  = 1.25^2 =  1.562    If you need to compute the actual values of resistance you;ll need to specify the shape of the wire (square, round) and whether a = 2 mm is the radius, diameter, etc. You'll also need the resistivity of copper = 1.7210-8 Ohm meter at 20 C.|`|6kC9me0baa	Resistance of a conductor increases as the length increases.

It depends on if its healthy or not.About one month prior to the theoretical date of birth,  22 months after the last mating, the preparations for the birth in the elephant stable start (Usually!) .|`|4IuoAw8daa	The female elephant, or cow, is sexually mature between the ages of twelve and fourteen and begins to reproduce shortly after that. Cows typically give birth to one calf at a time every four or five years. One of every one hundred births results in a twin delivery. The gestation period, length of pregnancy, for an elephant cow is twenty-two months. This ensures that the calf will be born during the rainy season, when grass will be plentiful for both mother and baby. Mating takes place at sixteen-week intervals year round.    Elephant cows give birth standing up, with the help of other females. Within hours, the calf will stand and take its first steps. Calves nurse, feed on their mother's milk, until they are two or three years old, sometimes longer, depending on the timing of the mother's next birth. Male calves nurse more frequently than do females, which becomes evident by the difference in size after the first few years.    Elephants have socially complex lives. The social structure is matriarchal (may-tree-ARK-ul), female-led, and the family is at the core. Each family unit has three to twenty-five members of adult females and their offspring. The females remain close throughout their lifetimes. Male elephants are typically solitary, preferring their own company to that of herds. They leave their birth families between the ages of twelve and fifteen and have no long-term bonds with them or any other elephants.    Groups are led by the older females, who make all decisions. Calves remain very close to their mothers, but all the females of the group will assist in raising the calves. Elephants are highly intelligent, and social interaction is complex. For example, within families, individuals greet one another by making sounds and touching each other with their trunks.

3s0xfNsfaa	I'm in grade 7 , but I'm going to take a stab at this question anyway.    Internal Stimulus is something you react to inside of the body. An example is breathing. There are sense receptors inside of your body that sense changes in amount of carbon dioxide in your system. When these receptors sense that there is too much carbon dioxide, they send a message that causes certain muscles in your chest to contract. These muscles force carbon dioxide out of your lungs, that is, they cause you to breathe out    External stimulus is something you react to outside of the body. For example, you touch a hot stove. Stimulus happens that sends a message by your nerve cells to your brain. Your brain analyzes it and send a message back down your arm that is carried by nerve cells once again, and you respond to stimulus.    I'm not positive that this is right, but I hope it helps.|`|vuZowE0xaa	I believe your talking about sex.  One is... inserted. Such as a dildo or a penis.  One is... external.

lsUMe5WVaa	The volume of a cylinder is just:    V = *rr*h    In this case, they both have the same diameter (and so same radius) but one is a meter taller. So the volumes are:    Va = *rr*h  Vb = *rr*(h+1)    Where Va is the volume of the shorter tower, Vb is the taller tower.  We're told that water is being pumped out at a constant rate. So if you write the volume of water remaining in the towers, you get:    Wa = Va*(1 - k*t)  Wb = Vb*(1 - C*t)    Where Wa and Wb are the volumes of water in tower a and b. The variables k and C are constants (the 'constant' rate at which water is being pumped out), t is the number of hours since the towers starting pumping out water.    So we know it takes the tall tower (11:30 - 5:30) 6 hours to empty. And we know that it takes (11:00 - 7:00) 4 hours to empty the smaller tower. So you can say:    0 = Va*(1 - k*4)  0 = Vb*(1 - C*6)    And lastly, we know that at 9:30, the water in each tower is the same. So we can say that Wa = Wb for the respective times (9:30 - 5:30 = 4 hours for the tall tower and 9:30 - 7:00 = 2.5 hours for the small tower).    Va*(1 - k*2.5) = Vb*(1 - C*4)    Now you have 3 equations right above. And you have the first two equations for Va and Vb, which you can sub in so that you only have 'h' as your variable. You can re-write the equations as:    1 - 4k = 0  1 - 6C = 0  [ (Vb/Va)*(1 - 4C) ] - (1 - 2.5k) = 0    Subbing in the expressions for Va and Vb turns the last equation into:    [ ( (h+1)/h )*(1 - 4C) ] - (1 - 2.5k) = 0    Now you have three unknowns (h, k and C) and three equations. So it's just a matter of solving them simultaneously. Fortunately, it's actually not too difficult to solve these, so I'll leave that part to you.

zdu3gh8jaa	This dog has obviously made a big impression on you so whether it was a 'regular' dog or one of your animal guides/totems, it really does not matter at this point. Dogs represent, loyalty, compassion, families, unconditional love, teamwork and unity among other things. See if any of these traits fit a situation in your life, if not perhaps you need to look at a situation differently and see if you need to make changes within yourself. Animal guides like other guides tend to stand out in a situation if you get what I mean, sometimes they 'fit' the surroundings yet they still stand out, other times they really don't fit. Ex: you're in a pet shop and see a fish tank with lots of fish - that fits - one fish is unbelievably bright and stands out from the rest,  the other scenario is that you see a fish 'swimming' along the road.  Hope this makes sense and helps somehow. If you think I may be able to explain it further then just email me.

The basin takes up almost half of the moon's southern hemisphere. One of the few things we do know is that the basin is in complete darkness 24 hours a day because of the depth of the basin and the height of the walls    The Lunar Prospector also found that the water is in concentrations of .3% to 1%, mixed in with the lunar soil, called regolith.

Truly an engineering feat to design them.  5) bearings: those blades spin, but on what? huge bearing systems that bump and grind and lose energy  6) scaleability: huge blades are required. newer technology is coming out with some really neat small blades that produce a fair amount of power (for a light post for example).

z7BiMSWmaa	In 1952, American biologists Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase set out to determine what composed the genetic material of a bacteriophage. They knew that a bacterial virus was an extremely simple organism, composed only of protein and DNA. The protein makes up the exterior of the virus, and the DNA is contained within it. When a bacterium is infected by a bacteriophage, the bacterium's internal machinery falls under the control of the virus, which uses the bacterium to produce more viruses. What Hershey and Chase wanted to know was: Which substance directed this takeover - DNA or protein?     The experiment that Hershey and Chase devised to differentiate between these possibilities was simple and took advantage of the differences in the composition of protein and DNA. Protein contains sulfur, DNA doesn't. Protein contains a small amount of phosphorus; DNA contains a lot of phosphorus.     Hershey and Chase added bacteriophage to cultures containing either radioactive sulfur or radioactive phosphorus. The bacteriophages grown in the cultures with radioactive sulfur picked it up and incorporated it into their protein. The bacterial viruses grown in the culture with radioactive phosphorus picked that up, incorporating a little of it into the protein, but most of it into their DNA. Hershey and Chase now had two types of bacteriophages: one with a radioactive external protein coat, the other with highly radioactive DNA. They were ready to begin their experiment.     Each of the two types of radioactive bacteriophage was added to a separate culture of bacteria. The bacteriophages were allowed to infect the bacteria, then the cultures were whirled in a kitchen blender, causing any part of the bacteriophages that hadn't got inside the bacteria to fall off. Next the cultures were spun in a centrifuge, which separates materials suspended in liquid according to their weights. The heavier bacterial cells fell to the bottom and formed a pellet, the lighter bacteriophages and loose phage parts remained in the liquid.     Where was the radioactivity now? It depended on which radioactive element you looked for. In the cultures infected by bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur (with labeled protein), most of the radioactivity was in the liquid with the phages. In the cultures infected by bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus (with most of the label in their DNA), most of the radioactivity was in the pellet of infected bacteria. Thus, the radioactive protein hadn't entered the bacterial cells, but the DNA had.     The final proof that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material was provided by the offspring of the phosphorus-labeled bacteriophages. They had radioactive DNA, passed down from their parents, but no radioactive protein. These experiments convinced the scientific community that DNA alone was the material of heredity, and inspired Watson and Crick to begin their efforts to discover its structure.

XjdhNPlGaa	Since you are trying to relate unit price and quantity, you can write the price and the quantities given as points on the line.    (1000, 270) and (6000, 420)    We can, therefore, write a linear equation in the form of P = mQ + b where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (420 - 270) / (6000 - 1000) = 150/5000    We can use one point and the slope to find b.    P = (150/5000)Q + b  270 = (150/5000)(1000) + b  270 = 30 + b  240 = b    Thus, we can write the equation for any point as:  P = (150/5000)Q + 240.    "How many refrigerators will be marketed when the unit price is $440?"    We are given P and are looking for Q.  Use the equation.    440 = (150/5000)Q + 240  200 = (150/5000)Q  6666.67 = Q    "What is the lowest price at which a refrigerator will be marketed?"

cHhEC9fpaa	This is a question of electrostatics (assuming that the two electrons are not moving with respect to one another).     The force between two stationary charges is given by Coulomb's law    F = q1 q2/(4 e0 r^2)    where q1 and q2 are the two charges (in coulombs), e0 is the electric constant ( = 8.85 x10^(-12) C^2 N^-1 m^-2), and r is the separation.    The charge of an electron is approximately e = -1.602 x 10^(-19) C, so we substitute q1 = q2 = e. If we know F and want to solve for the separation then     r^2 = e^2/(4 e0 F)    or     r = e/( 4 e0 F) = 1.519 x 10^(-8) meters = 15.19 nm

ku2tP4eEaa	I am gonna assume you are only doing Genus species names.  The Genus name in Latin usually refers to something that makes that animal unique to others in that Genera.  The species name is sometimes an anatomical structure that is unique to that animal.  Or some kinda behavior or perhaps a location or habitat.  It has become popular for people finding new species to name the critter after themselves.  You just need to understand the naming format.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	The easiest thing to do is to use a patronymic, that is, to name it after someone. For the generic name, just add "-ia" to the person's name.For a specific name, add "-i" to name it after a man, "-ae" to name it after a woman. An example is the brown or DeKay's snake, Storeria dekayi.    You have to be careful. An entomologist named Dyer found a new beetle and named it after a colleague. (I forget the name, so let's call him Smith.) Both Smith and the beetle were rather rotund, so Dyer named the new beetle Smithia obesus. Smith was not amused. He waited until he had a new beetle to describe and then named the genus after Dyer. Follow the rule and you will see what name he came up with.

AA6Aq94vaa	Plate tectonics in and of itself does is not necessary to sustain life. However, The earth's liquid outer core is what is responsible for the magnetic field around the planet, without the magnetic field humans and most life as we know it (other than a few types of bacteria) would quickly die out.   And it's from the heat released by the outer core that generates plate tectonics. So a more accurate statement would be that the force that is responsible for the plate tectonics is also responsible for life as we know it on earth.   Also I would like to add one more thing. The leading hypothesis on the origins of life is that it arises from a type of geothermal vent called a black smoker. Black smokers are created by the same forces that are responsible for plate tectonics, so it could be possible that life was caused by plate tectonics. But I should point out that scientists are still unsure of that one and more research needs to be done|`|CYtMRC4eaa	I don't think that plate tectonics or continental drift plays a role in sustaining life.

That makes it also the second highest in North America  after Mount McKinley. Due to active tectonic uplifting, Mount Logan is actually still getting bigger.     The Logan Massif contains a dozen of peaks higher than 5,500 metres. It is believed to have the largest base circumference of any mountain on Earth, not counting the main island of Hawaii, that stands on the ocean floor.
9iutgEYAaa	Yes! I love it so much! Its everything I've ever wanted in life!    When you start out you do have to take chemistry and physics and math classes, but they really help you understand some of the coolest stuff about animals!  Like in chemistry you can learn how an alcohol molecule can be converted into a salt molecule, in physics you learn about how fast a penguin can slide across a glacier, in math (stats) you learn how likely it is that a cat will be born with tabby fur.    By the time you get to the higher level courses you use that knowledge all the time. Ecology and genetics courses use a lot of stats. Cellular and molecular biology use a lot of chemistry. Anatomy and physiology use a lot of physics and chemistry.      In the beginning you'll take pretty generic classes, learning about basic biology, genetics, animal classification, etc. But when you get to about your junior year you'll (hopefully) have discovered what specific area in zoology is your passion.     There are so many possibilities within zoology. You could study any aspect of animal life from the molecular level up to global systems ecology and analysis. It really is the best subject, after four hard years I still couldn't imagine wanting to do anything else.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	I majored in zoology, and now work as a wildlife biologist.

It is an extremely tough study.  If you are thinking of going in to zoology because you love animals, think again.  Cause that is not gonna be enough to sustain you through all the tough courses.

So you best be a very good student and dedicated to your goal.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	I have a BS in biology,  zoology is not my favorite specialty.

It was very depressing having all these one legged frogs swimming in circles in the lab sink.  Supposedly they don't feel any pain, .  We even took the shells of turtles off and hooked their live hearts to a string to build a crude EKG.

UAYzLyN4aa	Magnets do not only attract other magnets. However in terms of ordinary field strengths and degrees of attraction, they only attract things that are "ferromagnetic." For materials you are likely to have lying around, this means iron and things with a lot of iron in them, like steel.     Not all steels, either. Many types of stainless steel are only very weakly attracted by magnets.     Brass, tin, and silver are simply not on the list.    Magnets do also interact with other materials via "paramagnetism," but this is too weak to be noticed most of the time. Brass, tin, and silver are not on that list either.    Later:    The Earth is not an exception. Its magnetic field is created by a sort of a natural dynamo involving its molten iron core. Without the iron in the core the Earth would have no magnetic field (as the Moon does not).     Sure, gravity attracts all matter... but gravity and magnetism are not at all the same thing.|`|12be0f24b8af3a7010c3386b50f8471aaa	You are standing on one called Earth.

Once for the acorn falling from the tree (initial velocity v=0) and once for the boy throwing the acorn (initial velocity v=45 m/2). You can just assume that the acorns start at y0 = h, the height of the tree, and that they fall to y=0 to make things easier.  However, the boy made your problem more difficult by waiting 2 seconds to throw his acorn. I'll tell you that you'll have to change the 't's to either (t+2) or (t-2) to account for the 2 second delay (for the equation describing the boy's acorn). If you aren't sure which one to chose, try subbing each one into the equation and then plug in t=2, and see if the equation makes sense.|`|TOiQmkbvaa	Both acorns have constant acceleration (due to gravity).  Distance traveled when there is constant acceleration,  d = (1/2)at^2 + v(o)t + d(o).  v(o) = initial velocity, d(o) equals initial position.    both have the same acceleration (9.8, due to gravity), distance traveled (d) and initial position (d(o)).    (1/2)at^2 + 0t + d(o) = (1/2)at^2 + 45t + d(o)  d(o)'s cancel, the t's are different.  The t on the left is t, and the t on the right is (t - 2)|`|phqhBQJkaa	basically the equalities here is are distance and time.      for the falling acorn we know:  distance falling = d  time = t  initial velocity = 0  acceleration = g    for the thrown acorn we know:  distance falling = d  time = (t - 2)  initial velocity = 45 m/s  acceleration = g      If I remember right (and I might not, so double check this) the formula is :  distance traveled = initial velocity * time + 1/2 * acceleration * t ^2.    so you know both acorns travel a distance d, so you can setup the equation as:    45 m/s * (t-2) + 1/2 * g * (t-2)^2 = 0 * t + 1/2 * g * t^2    Solve for t, and then plug it back into one side of the equation to get the distance d.

As it cools down, it forms a cloud: a cumulus.    When there is enough warm and moist air at the ground level, the air keeps rising and the cloud grow bigger. Soon the moisture condenses into bigger and bigger droplets and it starts raining. The cloud then is called a cumulonimbus because "nimbus" that simply means "cloud" in Greek, is used for clouds that bring precipitations.    A thunderstorm happen when there is a lot of warm and moist air at the base, and very cold air at the top. The cloud then keeps rising all the way to the tropopause; which is the ceiling of our troposphere; the place where weather happens.     As the cloud reaches that height, what was droplets of water is now ice crystal and it gives the typical anvil shape. It is then sometimes called a towering cumulus.    Cumulonimbus are places of extreme weather development and a place where light aircraft shall not venture. This is why cumulonimbus a.k.a. Cb among aviators, are clearly indicated in aviation weather forecast. Stay away from them!|`|MuALb7lxaa	The clouds most common in a thunderstorm are cumulonimbus clouds.
KJHw0oI3aa	Here is my answer:    (a) Start with 16 g of S8.  Use dimensional analysis to convert it to moles of S8.  Then convert it to moles of Fe, and finally, convert it to grams of Fe.    [(16 g S8)/1][(1 mol S8)/(256.48 g S8)][(8 mol Fe)/(1 mol S8)][(55.847 g Fe)/(1 mol Fe)] = 28 g of Fe    (b)  To find the grams of FeS produced, start (again) with 16 g S8 and, using dimensional analysis, convert it to moles of S8 as before.  Finally convert it to moles of FeS, followed by conversion to grams of FeS.    [(16 g S8)/1][(1 mol S8)/(256.48 g S8)][(8 mol FeS)/(1 mol S8)][(87.907 g FeS)/(1 mol FeS)] = 44 g of FeS

That requires Ohm's law to figure out. I'm assuming you already know Ohm's law, but it ends up being:    R = V/I    You have voltage and current already, so that's easy to find.    As for deciding whether it is a conductor/insulator or semiconductor, you have to first find the resistivity. Then you should just compare it to a list of resistivitys (which can also be found on wikipedia) and decide whether it is in the range of conductors or insulators or semiconductors (there is no strict definition of which resistivity correspond to each material type)..
UAYzLyN4aa	1. No, it's 0.6 amps. I = E / R :   Current in amps = voltage in volts / resistance in ohms.     1.5 volts / 2.5 ohms = 0.6 amps.    2 and 3 are impossible to know without knowing what "lifetime" is.     One Coulomb is 1 amp for 1 second. Since the toy is drawing 0.6 amps, charge in Coulombs would be equal to "lifetime" in seconds multiplied by 0.6.     Energy is measured in watt-seconds.

Then substitute into either equation and you get y = 2.    For the second one, rewrite as   2x = 5y + 5  2x = 10y - 1  and subtract to get 5y - 6 = 0, so y = 6/5.

Voltage is an indication of the energy contained in a coulomb.  current is the flow of coulombs in a branch.  That's why you add the current of all branches while the voltage remains the same.  Since at the start of the branch you can't tell which coulomb will go through which branch it's only fair that they have the same energy level (voltage).

UK1OMaG1aa	Most likely, the two specs were developed for different purposes.  For power transmission, voltage drop accross long wires is the issue, not overheating, since the wire is not confined and the heat would not build up.  For chassis bundle applications, the wire is short enough that voltage drop is not an issue, but overheating would be caused by heat build up.  It so happens that the requirements for voltage drop require less current than the requirements for overheating for a given diameter.  In addition, the chassis level wiring is often fused at  less than the current rating anyway, so the maximum current rating given is not used.

S8H5yYcoaa	You want to find several equations to solve this problem: for the distance the particle moves, you want to know its x-ward position, and so you'll be looking for the x- component; you also want the velocity, broken down into Vx and Vy.    Under constant acceleration a, for any direction d, Vd(t) = Vd(0) + a*t.  So Vx(t) = Vx(0) + ax*t = 3.70 - 1.10t,  and Vy(t) = Vy(0) + ay*t = 0 + 3.90t.    Position is the integral of velocity, so we then find  x(t) = x(0) + 3.70t - (1.1/2)t^2  Let's just call x(0) = 0, since we are trying to find the distance from here anyhow.  You could also find y(t), but the question doesn't involve it so I'm leaving it out for now.    The particle changes x-directions when its velocity changes from positive to negative; when Vx(t) = 0.  We then solve for t:  Vx(t) = 3.70 - 1.10t = 0   -1.10t = -3.70  t = -3.70/-1.10 = ~3.36 (3.36363636363636...)    The distance at time 37/11 is x(37/11) = 3.70(37/11) - (1.1/2)(37/11)^2   = 12.445454545... - 6.222727272727272... = 6.222727272727272... = ~6.22.    The total velocity at this point is given by [Vx(37/11), Vy(37/11)]   = [0, 3.90*(37/11)] = [0, 13.1181818181818...] = ~[0, 13.1].

n6DRsWEjaa	Complementary angles are two angles that together make a right angle (90 degrees). So this equation shows how you can find the angle:  Let x represent the smaller angle.  2x + x = 90  3x = 90  x = 90/3  x= 30  So one angle is 30 degrees and the other 60 degrees.|`|pk9JbCE8aa	A complementary angle  is an angle plus its complement=90 degrees.   I know this is awkward sentence structure, but that's the best way I can state it. let x=angle 2x= complement    x+2x=90 degrees; 3x=90   x=90/3=30 degrees  90-30=60    Therefore 30 degrees = the angle, 60 degrees the complement angle|`|fO5JWKMlaa	2x+x=180    180/3=60    60*2=120    first angle is 120 degrees    the second is 60 degrees|`|glynFK9haa	First, write an equation.  The measure of an angle (2x) is twice the measure of its compliment (x).  The total would be 90, since complementary angles form a right angle.  Put it together.  2x+x=90.  Then, combine like terms.  3x=90.  Then, divide each by three.  x=30.|`|qGHNXwMraa	complementary angles are two angles that add up to 90 degrees. So first set the smaller angle a variable (or larger but i think smaller is easier, it depends on the person) for example x. Since the larger angle is twice as big then it means the larger angle is 2x because its like having two of the same angles. And because they are complementary angles, they add up to 90 degrees so x+2x=90.  then you solve the equation.  3x=90  x=30  so the smaller angle is 30 degrees and the larger is 60 degrees.    hope this helps|`|Wet70hbaaa	i agree with the guy that answered this first.    x=60 in his equation.    think of half a circle, and picture it split in thirds.    every third is 60 degrees    (my attempt at explaining it more clearly)

N0UUmjDlaa	Well, you really will have to get a piece of foil, and lots of pennies, and experiment with it in your bathtub.  You should err on the side of maximum displacement, which will mean minimum freeboard (side height).  You can make the sides bow out a bit, to increase displacement when the "boat" gets heavier.  The pennies will need to be spread out in a single layer first, then further ones added around the edges first, then towards the centre, in a second and subsequent layers.  If the boat starts to droop in the centre, avoid putting further coins there, add them around the edges until the boat evens up again.  Then, maybe, more can be added towards the centre.  You will need to add coins very gently.

z7BiMSWmaa	The details of the C4 cycle     After entering through stomata, CO2 diffuses into a mesophyll cell.   Being close to the leaf surface, these cells are exposed to high levels of O2, but   have no RUBISCO so cannot start photorespiration (nor the dark reactions of the Calvin cycle).  Instead the CO2 is inserted into a 3-carbon compound (C3) called phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) forming   the 4-carbon compound oxaloacetic acid (C4).   Oxaloacetic acid is converted into malic acid or aspartic acid (both have 4 carbons), which is   transported (by plasmodesmata) into a bundle sheath cell. Bundle sheath cells   are deep in the leaf so atmospheric oxygen cannot diffuse easily to them;   often have thylakoids with reduced photosystem II complexes (the one that produces O2).   Both of these features keep oxygen levels low.  Here the 4-carbon compound is broken down into   carbon dioxide, which enters the Calvin cycle to form sugars and starch.   pyruvic acid (C3), which is transported back to a mesophyll cell where it is converted back into PEP.
b96e23f4e62d95301c15a6f530a29fe7aa	The simple answer is because they are not well-designed to capture low-speed winds and are too large in diameter to economically use more blades. Here is an interesting site for more on that:    http://nov55.com/wdm.html    More blades are better for higher efficiency because more blades intercept more of the available wind and at a lower minimum wind speed. The down side is more blades have a lower maximum wind speed. When the wind blows faster than the maximum speed for which the windmill is designed, the blades must be "feathered" and pointed edge-on into the wind to keep the windmill from literally flying apart.    Apparantly there has been little or no recent "practical" engineering study (using real windmills, not computer models) of number of blades versus diameter versus wind speed to determine what works "best" for small or personal wind farms.    I am pretty sure such studies were performed for the giant 3-blade windmills you see in areas with a more or less steady wind and with a predictable range of wind velocities. No one would finance such contraptions without at least some sort of engineering feasibility study... I would hope!    A more subtle reason might be how the wind power is converted to electricity. Large 3-bladed wind farms must feed into the 3-phase alternating current grid if they are to be economically effective. That probably influences their diameter and rotation speed.    If I were building one (or several) of these puppies, I think I would take a clue from automobile alternators: generate variable frequency 3-phase alternating current and rectify it to direct current. Use the direct current to drive a pulse-width modulated (PWM) 3-phase inverter making constant frequency 60 Hz alternating current. You can feed that right into the power grid with proper synchronization.    You might get yourself an automobile alternator and connect it to a 15 to 20 blade windmill, three or four feet in diameter, just to see how much power it will produce in a moderate wind of 5 to 15 MPH. Most modern alternators are good for at least a kilowatt, more if properly cooled.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	The new windmills only have 3 blades because it's easier build and maintain 3, as opposed to models with more.  Also 3 blades makes it easier to keep the load on the windmill balanced - an out of balance windmill will shake itself to pieces (oftentimes quite spectacularly...)  It also has something to do with the fact that the blades on those electricity generating windmills are quite a bit larger than the ones you see on those water-pumping windmills.  I don't think the tower would be able to stand if you build a system with 15 to 20 blades on it, considering that each blade is longer than the wing of a large aircraft.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	It's a much larger unit, and a different design problem.  Those old units were '1920's' technology and really were quite   a remarkable design achievement for their day as a practical   easily maintained system.  (Those old multi-blade fans were mechanically governed, and   tilted across the wind when it got too strong.)  For generation of electricity the speed control is far more   critical and electrically actuated hydraulic governors are   employed to 'pitch' those long blades.  With modern material and controls we can erect the more efficient   long blade design.  The old design was a mechanical compromise, as with the   materials then available, the more efficient configuration   would have been too fragile and / or expensive,   and control would have been too complex for   practical use.

They design equipment and develop processes for large-scale chemical manufacturing, plan and test methods of manufacturing the products and treating the by-products, and supervise production. Chemical engineers also work in a variety of manufacturing industries other than chemical manufacturing, such as those producing electronics, photographic equipment, clothing, and pulp and paper. They also work in the healthcare, biotechnology, and business services industries.     The knowledge and duties of chemical engineers overlap many fields. Chemical engineers apply principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics, and mechanical and electrical engineering. They frequently specialize in a particular operation such as oxidation or polymerization. Others specialize in a particular area, such as pollution control or the production of specific products such as fertilizers and pesticides, automotive plastics, or chlorine bleach. They must be aware of all aspects of chemicals manufacturing and how it affects the environment, the safety of workers, and customers. Because chemical engineers use computer technology to optimize all phases of research and production, they need to understand how to apply computer skills to process analysis, automated control systems, and statistical quality control.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	In the field of engineering, a chemical engineer is the profession in which one works principally in the chemical industry to convert basic raw materials into a variety of products, and deals with the design and operation of plants and equipment to perform such work.[1] In general, a chemical engineer is one who applies and uses principles of chemical engineering in any of various practical applications; primarily with respect to the study of the design, manufacture, and operation of plant and machinery in industrial chemical and related processes.

There seems to be more mass in every galaxy than can be accounted for by observed "glowing" matter (stars, and stuff we can "see".)    Our "solar system" has no such thing as "linear" velocity, except in the sense of  the instantaneous velocity at some moment of time (the derivative.)    Of course, the vector velocity fals naturally from these equations...    Here is some info on orbital calculations....

First find a number ending with zero (s) 10, 100, 1000,10000, etc.    Closest one it 100.    So, 6/25= ?/100    Well, how many times does 25 go into? 4. (4 times 25 =100)    Now do the same with 6 to get 24 to make it equal.  So now you got 6/25 = 24/100.    Decimal place rules:    0.1= tenth  0.01= hundereth  0.001= thousandth, etc.    So you need to get 2 places after the point.     thus, .24    (24/1000 would've been .024, 24/10 would've been 2.4 cause it's more than 1 and so on.)     Just think of it as changing the denomenator to become a one.    24/100; u need to move the decimal from the end twice to the left for the 100 to become a 1. Do the same with the 24 to make them equivlent. .24 it your answer.

PkGROcYqaa	DNA bases are all ring structures. These abosorb UV light.  With proteins, you only have three amino acids that exhibit this absorbance. They are phenylalanine(F), tyrosine(Y), and tryptophan(W). The UV absorbance depends on the amount of the F, Y, and W. If no aromatic amino acids, then no absorbance. In contrast, DNA does not depend on the number of bases because no matter the number of bases you have, it will still absorb.    good luck.

Then from the head of the arrow, draw the current's velocity relative to the ground point West (or East). Assuming you swim directly across (otherwise, more information is needed), you should be able to connect the two arrows that you've drawn to form a right-angled triangle.    The swimmer's velocity with respect to the current is the hypontenuse, the current's velocity with respect to the ground is the base and the swimmer's velocity with respect to the ground is the height.    cos28 = v/15, where v is the current's velocity  v = 1.5cos28  v = 1.3 m/s|`|cxiPvqtsaa	um.. i got 2m/s

AA11602341	Bulbs are just resistors. And using P = RI^2, you'll see that the resistance of the bulb will go up with the power (Wattage).    Ohm's Law: V = IR =>  I = V/R substitute into Power equation  P = R(V/R)^2 = V^2/R solve for R  R = V^2/P    R1 = (120 V)^2/(30 W) = 480   R2 = (120 V)^2/(40 W) = 360     The amount of light given off is directly proportional to the current across the resistor.    I = V/R    I1 = V/R1 = (120 V)/(480 ) = 250 mA  I2 = V/R2 = (120 V)/(360 ) = 333 mA    In series, the 40 W bulb would be brighter than the 30 W bulb.    In parallel, more current will flow through the path of less resistance. so the 40 W bulb will still be brighter than the 30 W bulb.    So they would be ranked:  30 w bulb in the parallel circuit 4  40 w bulb in the parallel circuit 3  30 w bulb in the series circuit 2  40 w bulb in the series circuit 1|`|yxnUBSJqaa	30W Parallel - Full brightness   40W Parallel - Full brightness  30W Series - No light  40W Series - No light|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	This is difficult if not impossible. Bulbs have a very non-linear relationship between voltage and resistance. When you put unlike bulbs in series, the voltage division is a complicated function of the resistance versus power or versus voltage curves of each bulb.     And you didn't supply that info.    part two has the same problem.     In parallel, the 40w bulb is brighter than the 30w bulb. But in series, no way to tell, although they will both be dimmer than either of the parallel ones.    .|`|N0UUmjDlaa	If you had the 2 bulbs you have indicated to be in series actually connected parallel, the resistance of both bulbs can be calculated.  But when they are in series, the greater part of the voltage will be across the 30W bulb, as it will have the higher resistance.   But as there is no information available, the resistance can't be calculated, other than by measuring the current, and voltage split between the bulbs.  The most likely order of brightness:  The 40W bulb in parallel will be the brightest.  The 30W parallel bulb would be next.  Then in the series connection, the 30W bulb is likely to be the 3rd. brightest, then lastly the 40W bulb.   But no guarantees!
cHhEC9fpaa	The fundamental relations are Ohm's law V = I R and Joules law, the relation between power, voltage and current P = I V. These are true for pure resistors.    The resistance of the light bulbs can then be computed because P = V^2/R, i.e.,     R = V^2/P    Consider two light bulbs in parallel with resistances R1 and R2. The total resistance R is given by    1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2    or    1/R = P1/V^2 + P2/V^2    Now the total power is given by P = V^2/R or     P = V^2 (P1/V^2 + P2/V^2) = P1 + P2    In the parallel case P = 30 + 40 W = 70 W.       For the series case the total resistance is    R = R1 + R2 = V^2/P1 + V^2/P2    and the total power is     P = V^2/R = V^2/(V^2/P1 + V^2/P2)  = 1/(1/P1 + 1/P2) = 17.1 W.     The answer for the series case is correct for ideal light bulbs, but  not quite accurate in the real world because the resistance of real light bulbs depends on their temperature. Because bulbs operating in series will operate a at lower voltage they will reach a lower temperature and so their resistance will be different from when they work at full power.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	In parallel, you just add the wattages.  In series take the combined resistance and apply 120V. to that.  Use (E = I/R), to figure the two resistances and to combine the total.  I get about 17 Watts.

I'll just give you some help.    1.  Alright, so, 125 lbs.  Let's think about this question.  To determine your weight in kilograms, what do you need to know?      You need to know how many pounds (the quantity that you have) fit into a kilogram (that quantity you want).    So, a kilogram = ~2.2 pounds.  It looks like a long number, but it's not.  Ok, knowing that, what do you need to do now?    So, if you know that you can fit about 2 of your 125 pounds into a kilogram, how many kg will you have?    125 divided by 2.2 will give you the answer.      2.  Ok, so, once again.  1 foot = 304. 8 millimeters.  You know you're 5 foot 6 inches, so:  304.8 x 5 = 1524   You're not finished yet, though.  1 inch = 25.4 mm  So, you're 5 foot 6 inches:  25.4 x 6 = 152.4  Now, add them up!  1524 + 152.4 = 1676.4 (your answer)    3.  This is an odd question.    Each quarter = 15 minutes, right?  So, you need to know how many minutes there are in a day.  We know there are 24 hours, each with 60 minutes in them.  24 x 60 = 1440 minutes (number of minutes in a day).  Now, to determine this, we need to divide 15 minutes by 1440 minutes.  15/1440 = 0.0104166    4.  9 weeks = 7 days x 9 = 63 days, 12 problems each night, 63 x 12 = 756 per quarter  2 quarters to a semester, 756 x 2.  Unless, of course, you assume 5 nights a week.    5.  Ok, 1mph = 88 fpm  88 x 1 = 88  88 x 25 = 2200  2200 fpm    If I may ask: which grade are you in?  Oh yes, and if you ever have math-related questions, feel free to e-mail me at lasius.flavus@gmail.com.    -Sophia

A stick of 1x2x36 inch hardwood (poplar is easy to work with, oak is more durable) a cigar box (or other wooden box) tuners (which can be purchased pretty cheap, or you can improvise with eyebolts) and strings (which can be substituted with fishing line). If you want frets you can add fretwire or improvise using wire or toothpicks. They're easy to make, and sound good. With a couple extra parts (about $5 worth) you can even make it electric.    You can also build a kalimba from stiff metal and a wooden box. I built a couple using bike spokes and rake tines.

Can you use a household water filter to remove flavor or color from other liquids?    How permanent are permanent markers? What solvents (e.g., water, alcohol, vinegar, detergent solution) will remove the ink? Do different brands/types of markers produce the same results?

vZhVSYDMaa	In multiplication, your answer would have as many significant figures as the number with the least number of figures in the problem. In that one, your answer should have 3. The first number has 4, the second 3, and the third 4, so  your answer should have the least, 3.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	The significant figures (also called significant digits and abbreviated sig figs) of a number are those digits that carry meaning contributing to its accuracy (see entries for accuracy vs. precision). This includes all digits except:        * leading and trailing zeros where they serve merely as placeholders to indicate the scale of the number.      * spurious digits introduced, for example, by calculations carried out to greater accuracy than that of the original data, or measurements reported to a greater precision than the equipment supports. Significant digits are to be used all the time with no exceptions when dealing with the physics aspect of sciences. Significant show true precision, and should therefore be used all the time.    The concept of significant figures is often used in connection with rounding. Rounding to n significant figures is a more general-purpose technique than rounding to n decimal places, since it handles numbers of different scales in a uniform way. A practical calculation that uses any irrational number necessitates rounding the number, and hence the answer, to a finite number of significant figures. Computer representations of floating point numbers typically use a form of rounding to significant figures, but with binary numbers.    The term "significant figures" can also refer to a crude form of error representation based around significant figure rounding; for this use, see Significance arithmetic.    and       Significance arithmetic is a set of rules (sometimes called significant figure rules) for approximating the propagation of uncertainty in scientific or statistical calculations. These rules can be used to find the appropriate number of significant figures to use to represent the result of a calculation. If a calculation is done without analysis of the uncertainty involved, a result that is written with too many significant figures can be taken to imply a higher precision than is known, and a result that is written with too few significant figures results in an avoidable loss of precision. Understanding these rules requires a good understanding of the concept of significant and insignificant figures.    The rules of significance arithmetic are an approximation based on statistical rules for dealing with probability distributions. See the article on propagation of uncertainty for these more advanced and precise rules. Significance arithmetic rules rely on the assumption that the number of significant figures in the operands gives accurate information about the uncertainty of the operands and hence the uncertainty of the result. For an alternative see interval arithmetic.    An important caveat is that significant figures apply only to measured values. Values known to be exact should be ignored for determining the number of significant figures that belong in the result. Examples of such values include:        * integer counts (e.g., the number of oranges in a bag)      * definitions of one unit in terms of another (e.g. a minute is 60 seconds)      * actual prices asked or offered, and quantities given in requirement specifications      * legally defined conversions, such as international currency exchange      * scalar operations, such as "tripling" or "halving"      * mathematical constants, such as  and e

v3Ic7g9Eaa	The easiest thing you can do is to eat less meat. The intensive cattle farms use a lot of resources to produce the meat. Cattle feed is transported all over the earth (CO2), tons of artificial fertilizer is used (emitting a lt of NOx), and cows are a source of methane, becuase their ruminants. If you want to eat meat, buy locally produced, locally fed organic meat, and support sustainable modes of farming.     On food in general: buy local, and accordin to the season. and buy what you need. Locally produced requires less fuel, and less resources. Everything you buy costs energy to make. Do you really need it? will you be using it for a longer time? is it durable.     Another easy thing to do is leave your car at the door, and use a bicycle. Energy for miles, the bicycle is by far the most efficient means of transport. Its healthy and fun too. Any distance below 10 km is easy to do on a proper bike. If you need to travel further, try public transport before a car.    Another thing can be insulating your home, and avoiding use of airconditioning when it's hot. Openng the windows during the night hels to cool the house too. If you are a cold area, air your home once a day. The cold outside air is dryer, and easier to heat that the old damp indoors air. Wear a sweater, and heat only those rooms that you really use.    Avoid using airplanes. I live in europe, and i love travelling by train, even if it takes me a day extra.

74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	In general, where anything burns, it uses up oxygen during the combustion.  That leaves a small vacuum where the oxygen was expended and the surrounding air moves in to fill that slight vacuum.  That's wind.  The wind blows the candle or whatever flame towards the burning object.    In a very small way, this is the physics behind so-called firestorms.  Firestorms are tremendously hot very large wildfires that create their own winds.  These winds in turn churn up the fires so that they are hotter than before.  And so the cycle goes, hotter fires yield more winds and hotter fires still.  This is one of several reasons the wildfires in California are so hard to contain.    BTW, it was unclear if your "combustible item" was burning or not.  If that cigarette is unlit, then the only reason a candle flame would bend towards it is that the smoker was inhaling to bring the flame of the candle to the cigarette to ignite it.  But if the combustible item is in fact burning, any flame will lean into it because of the mini winds created by the burning item.
TL1Jkqunaa	It used to be believed that the genes told each cell how to specialize somehow, even though each cell has the same genes.  It turns out that the cells location is more influential in determining what type of cell a cell will become.  Experiments show that moving a cell in a very early fetus from one spot to another changes what the cell becomes.    This, incidentally, is why stem cell research has such high potential.

uAEZeyAAaa	It appears that Mayan ideas about time keeping and calendars were very cyclical. This is actually easy to understand because it's quite like our calendar which has cycles of various sizes very familiar to us. For example there is a:        * 1 Jan every year      * day 1 every month      * Monday every week      * 1am every day    The Mayan cycles were a bit more complex, such that every day in a 52 year period had a unique name from a combination of various different cycles (similar to the idea that there is a Monday 1st January only every 7 years or so). This 52 year cycle has is called a Calendar Round. To keep track of dates on longer time scales the Mayans then had what's known as the Long Count, which provides a unique numerical indicator for each day. Mayans did not count in base ten like we did, but usually instead in base 20 (although not always). The Mayan long count can be summarized as:     days Mayan count  1  1 kin  20  20 kin  1 uinal  360  360 kin  18 uinal  1 tun  7200  7200 kin  360 uinal 20 tun 1 kactun  144000  144000 kin  8000 uinal  400 tun  20 kactun  1 bactun    The name for a Mayan epoch apparently translates as 13 bactuns, which you can see is 13*144000 days or 5125.26 years (roughly). There is actually some minor disagreement over when the current Mayan long cycle started, but it was probably either August 11th or 13th 3114 BC, which means it comes to an end on either Dec 21st or 23rd 2012.    As I mentioned above the Mayan calendar was designed to be cyclical, so the fact that the long count comes to an end in Dec 2012, while having some significance for the Maya as the end of a great cycle (much like we celebrated the millennium (incorrectly as it happens) on Dec 31st 1999), does not mean that the "world will come to an end". It's actually true that there are Mayan names for periods of time longer than 13 bactuns, so that their calendar doesn't even end then, and even if it did there is no evidence to suggest that they (or anyone for that matter) have any special knowledge about the end of the world.    There are however a lot of theories knocking around the Internet which use the end of this calendar cycle to predict the end of the world. They often also mention the fact that Dec 21st is the winter solstice, and that the Sun on the solstice that year is "aligned" with the plane of the galaxy. On the winter solstice, the Sun always has a Declination of -23.5 degrees, and a Right Ascension of 18 hours, but exactly where this is on the sky relative to more distant stars changes very slowly due to the "precession of the equinoxes". We have a posted answer explaining this effect but how it's important in this answer (and how it was first noticed) is by the fact that it moves the position of the equinoxes, and solstices with a period of 26,000 years in a complete circle around the sky westward along the ecliptic. So the position of the winter solstice moves 360 degrees in 26,000 years. That means that it moves 360/26000 = 0.01 degrees a year. Defining an exact boundary for the plane of the Milky Way is tough, but it's at least 10-20 degrees wide across much of the sky, meaning that the solstice can be described as being "in the plane of the Milky Way" for 700-1400 years! To put it another way, the winter solstice that just past (2005) was only 0.1 degrees away from where it will be in 2012, a distance smaller than the size of the Sun itself (which is about 0.5 degrees in diameter). In any case the Sun crosses the plane of the Galaxy twice every year as we orbit around it, with no ill effect on Earth.    To conclude:        * The Mayan calendar does not predict the end of the world on Dec 12th 2012.           1. The exact date of the end of the current Mayan Long Count is still a matter of debate amongst Mayan scholars, although it is likely to be around Dec 21 2012.           2. The Mayan calendar is cyclical, and there are names for cycles longer than 13 bactuns of the Long Count which are coming to an end in 2012.        Even if the Mayans did believe that the world would come to an end at the end of the Long Count (which I don't believe is true), there is no reason to assume that they have any special knowledge which would allow them to make this prediction correctly. You are free to believe the Sun won't come up tomorrow, but it will anyway....        * The fact that the winter solstice on 2012 is "aligned" with the plane of the Galaxy has no significance.           1. It takes the winter solstice 700-1400 years to cross the plane of the Galaxy.           2. The solstice last year (2005) was within 0.1 degrees (or 1/5th the size of the Sun) of where it will be on 2012.           3. The Sun crosses the plane of the Milky Way twice every year with no ill effect.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	HOAX    Anything to do with 2012, and asking people to be ready, is all part of a conspiracy to separate fools from their money.    ---    Planet X was invented by charlatans, in order to explain their "prediction" of the end-of-the-world for... 2003.    They had a book for sale then, on how to survive the end-of-the-world.    When 2003 came and went, they changed their book to the new popular date (2012), added Nibiru and Nemesis to their planet X (all three are non-existent); they also created fake "documentaries" for television and YouTube.    They and others also branched out in other types of "services" like providing advise and bunker space if you want to survive the end-of-the-world (as if).    The IHC is just one of these groups wanting to cash in on the Big 2012 Hoax.  Since it is a California outfit, I'm surprised that they have not joined (yet) with the people who are selling plots on the Moon.  Unless, of course, they have already realized that if the Moon land swindlers get your money first, there won't be any left for them.    For now, it looks to me like these are a different group than the charlatans who have invented Planet X.  But I could be wrong.    ---    There is a storage for seeds in a Scandinavian country.

Everything you have heard about 2012 is full of half-truths and outright lies, with the following exceptions.    1. There will be an American presidential election in 2012.  2. The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012."     (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)    December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.    All the other predictions, "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) "galactic alignments" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it, "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.|`|dgQ4MciGaa	Welp, here goes.    The Mayans had a calendar, one of the few that didn't have Garfield griping about Mondays.  They were excellent astronomers and really geeky mathmaticians:  they counted on their fingers AND their toes, and used Base 5, Base 10, and Base 20! (Times table musta been a major groaning *****.)    They also were very religious and used their astronomy to figure out what the gods were up to. This is what they came up with:  On December 21, (they called it something else... I'm transcribing here) 2012 CE, the whole universe would end and restart itself all over!  They called this event 'The Great Reboot', or the Mayan equivalent.    They had no idea that a thousand years later they would all end up on YouTube and some movie studio would green light their 'prophecy' as a major motion picture.    Flashback!  050505.  May 5th, 2005 CE the planets were gonna align and the world was going to come to an end.  I think that was the year MySpace debuted.  Lotsa rushing around and buying up toilet paper and bottles of Aquafina. (Pepsi got mad rich).  Cults were formed, promises made, gifts exchanged... we've seen it all before.    And this is the same thing.  Nostradamus, Revelations, the Rigged Veda... play yer cards right and you can read anything into them.  Or wring anything out of them.    As Popeye oft remarked;  "Ain't nothin' but a coinkydink". That's 'coincidence' to everyone except maybe Olyve Oyl.    Not a hoax so much as just something to make a big deal over.  And maybe pick up a little loose change from people who will pay big bucks for all the books, magazines, articles, movies, and ... yes... calendars!    Now.  YOU can prepare YOURSELF and YOUR FRIENDS for the coming semi-doom which will occur Friday, April 13th, 2029 CE.  On THAT day, an asteroid (really big rock whizzing around in space) will pass the earth (another really, really big rock which we all happen to live on) by a red-headed short hair (really very close, astronomically speaking) and scare a lot of people (mostly people with no scientific training) to death!  Or worse, repenting of sins!    At that time the wonderful folks at NASA, who brought you Mr. MaGoos Space Telescope, will be able to calculate if this really big rock will hit us when it RETURNS 7 YEARS LATER!    And if it DOES hit us?  Move over dinosaurs, make room for homo saps (us).  It will be what acronymists call an 'ELE', Extinction Level Event!  And yes, several movies have been made on the subject.    So why wait?  You can start the panic NOW!  Just tell all your friends that 2012 is a cake walk compared to Friday the 13th, 2029!    You might want to write your congressman about this.  The total number of people working on the problem of really big rocks hitting us where we live could NOT, repeat NOT, staff a full shift at McDonalds!    As for the 'instatoot fer human beans continuing', it's prolly good for a few chuckles.    But, to answer your question (finally), it's not so much a hoax (December 21, 2012 CE WILL happen, just before Dec.22. 2029) as it is something to do... or make a big todo about.  So relax, enjoy the fun and leave the TP on the shelves.  If it does occur, well, that's life.

Well guess what, 2000 came and went, as did 1666 (The so-called second coming of Christ), as will 2012, as will 2031 (big asteroid suppose to hit earth).     So, is the world really going to end in 2012?  Of course not.  Is it possible that life could change as we know it?  It has already has, 3 years ahead of schedule; that's 11 trillion dollars and counting in case you didn't know (something even your great grand kids will be paying for in the future).  You can thank the greed of big business and corrupt politians, who like to charge your money, for that!  Now we are going to reward them by bailing them out?  Fail!      Forget 2012, our world ended in 2008!  It's sad because I get a great sense of optimism out there with Obama getting elected and the banner of "change" still lingering in the air, but people need to wake up and realize that it's really bad and it's only going to get a lot worse.

bMEXTHSWaa	Easy setup really.      You have a two experimental areas, with an established observance of predation on the mimic species. One should contain only the mimics, and one has some poisonous, some mimics.  By counting the number of mimics eaten in each plot and comparing, you should be able to disprove a null hypothesis (there is no difference in predation).  Your control is the mimic only population, the experimental is the half/half.      Keep in mind you can never prove anything in science, only disprove one hypothesis in support of the other.

AA11824362	Your first misconception is "California will [fall off] into the ocean". This is a common belief among those ignorant of the facts. The plate boundary separating the Pacific Plate from the North American Craton is the San Andreas Fault (which is a transverse fault zone). As the North American Plate moves southwest the Pacific Plate (including a thin sliver from San Francisco to Baja California) is moves northwest. There is subsidence in the Central Valley of California, but that is a long way from "CA falls into the ocean".  Your second misconception is "Yellowstone National Park is just a Giant inverted volcano". To me, an inverted volcano couldn't exist, because its magma chamber would have to be above its lava flows, and that is not possible. Earthquakes (as a rule) do not trigger volcanoes; rising magma triggers earthquakes.

Ob9AZnA4aa	It raises the boiling point of water. Simply because since more particles are put into the water it would take higher temperatures or longer durations to bring it up to a boil. Think about it. If you add more water into a teakettle it would take longer to heat up right? Well adding salt, which splits (fully dissociates) into sodium and chloride, would add more substance into the water getting in the way of the water molecules from heating up.     That's it simply. This is just extra info in case you needed to know technically when water boils. The water boils with changing points of pressure. Heating the water raises the pressure of the water. When the pressure of the water is equal to the pressure of the environment, then the water boils. That's why it takes different amounts of time to boil at higher elevations! Hope this helped.|`|KJHw0oI3aa	Addition of salt raises the temperature at which water boils (boiling point of water) at any atmospheric pressure.    To put it simply, in a liquid, water molecules are very close together, and attract each other quite strongly.  Each molecule of water may have a different amount of kinetic energy (energy of motion), so it moves with a different speed.  The average kinetic energy of molecules is proportional to the temperature of the water.  To understand what that means, perhaps we could compare the energies of molecules of water to your test grades.  Suppose you got the following grades during a particular marking period:  75, 100, 65, and 80.  Each grade is different, but your average [(75 + 100 + 65 + 80) / 4 = 80] is 80.  If more of your grades were higher, then your average would also be higher.  When you heat water, more molecules have more kinetic energy, and the average kinetic energy of all the molecules increases (just like your grades), and the temperature of water increases.      What keeps the water in the liquid state is not only the attraction that the water molecules have for each other, but also the air molecules that keep hitting the surface of water.  This is known as air pressure.  As soon as more energetic molecules pop their "heads" up on the surface of the water, some air molecule hits it back preventing it from escaping (evaporating).  Even so, the most energetic molecules that somehow find their way to the surfae, are able to escape and become a gas (vapor).  This vapor creates so-called "vapor pressure" that fights back against the air pressure from above.  When water is heated, its temperature rises more and more molecules have enough energy to escape, until so much vapor is created that the vapor pressure equals the air pressure from above.  At that point the water boils.  That means that now, not only molecules on the surface of water can vaporize, but all the molecules in the water can do so.  This creates bubbles in the whole volume of water.  We call this boiling.    When salt is dissolved in water, the ions in the salt are separated and become surrounded by water molecules.  Ions are atoms that have positive or negative charges.  Water molecules are not ions, but they have positive and negative charges on opposite sides of their molecules.  Hence, they are strongly attracted to the salt ions.  This creates additional obstacle to evaporation, because evaporating water molecules must have extra energy to overcome their attraction to ions.  This lowers the vapor pressure of water because less molecules can evaporate at the same temperature as before.  So, water must be heated now to a higher temperature in order to boil.|`|JjxqRRJ9aa	The salt raises the temperature at which the water boils, so the water has to be hotter before it will start to boil.     The reason has to do with the positive and negative charges of salt (NaCl). The Na has a positive charge which attracts the oxygen in water. The Cl has a negative charge and attracts the hydrogen. In order for something to boil, the molecules have to escape from the surface of the liquid. So, because of the new binding of the hydrogen and oxygen to the Sodium (Na) and the Chloride (Cl), it takes more energy (higher temperature) for the molecules to reach the surface and escape.     I'm not sure if that would be considered simple but its the best way I can think of to explain it. Hope it helps. :)
XuVwWIMeaa	friction betewwn the flywheel and the air  friction between the flywheel and its support structure (axle)  electrical resistance in the generator  sound  magnetic energy not converted to electricity    hope this helps|`|xXOnjDNOaa	Presumably the flywheel is rotating in air - friction against the air will steal some of the energy, as will friction of the wheel's bearing in the dynamo.  Additionally while the electricity is flowing the wires leading to and from the bulb will have some resistance in them, causing them to heat up (dissipating some of the energy before it can get to the bulb).|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	The flywheel friction and the dynamo friction are most likely places.  There might be a bit of air drag friction, but minimal compared to the friction of both pieces at the hubs where they rotate around.      The other place is at the bulb, through the heat and light energy it throws off.  But as this is the useful energy we are looking for, we don't really consider it lost.
I0XEVeUxaa	It should be an electron acceptor in the electron transport (oxidative phosphorylation) chain in mitochondria.  After deamination by transaminases and movement of ammonia to the urea cycle, the de-aminated acids are processed into various metabolic pathways, namely into the TCA cycle.  Alkyl side chains such as isoleucine and leucine are subjected to FAD-dependent desaturases.  Other processes involves dehydrogenation (NAD-dependent).  Both reduced FAD and NAD forms get oxidized in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, where oxygen waits.|`|bMEXTHSWaa	I agree with the above poster.  in Electron transport chain, Oxygen is the lowest electron acceptor, which is why, when your muscles run out of oxygen they go into anabolic respiration

x384qQ3Iaa	This question is all about Tarzan's energy in the different situations, that is, his potential and kinetic energy at the starting point, and then his kinetic energy at the bottom of the swing.     To find these answers, you first need to find how far above the bottom of the swing he starts.  Draw a diagram of the vine inclined at an angle of 36 and use trigonometry to figure out the starting height above the bottom.  You should get that h=23.8*(1-cos(36)).    For (a), Tarzan only has potential energy at the beginning, and only kinetic energy at the bottom of the swing. So all the potential energy is converted to kinetic, which gives the equation: m*g*h = 1/2*m*v^2.  Solve for v, and you get v = sqrt(2*g*h).    For (b), Tarzan has both kinetic and potential energy at the beginning, and again, only kinetic at the bottom of the swing.  This situation gives the equation m*g*h + 1/2*m*(v-initial)^2= 1/2*m*(v-final)^2.  You want to solve for v-final, and you should get that v-final = sqrt(2*g*h + v-initial^2). Plug in the value you found for h, and the value you are given for v-initial (his initial speed), and remember that g is the acceleration due to gravity (about 9.8 m/s^2).|`|YrOTZsjtaa	First find the vertical displacement, which is the difference in his initial height and his the point where he is at the bottom of his swing.This difference is:    23.8m - 23.8mcos36.0 = 4.55m    Now from conservation of mechanical energy:    0.5mv^2 = mgh  v = (2gh)^0.5  = (2 x 9.80m/s^2 x 4.55m)^0.5  = 9.44m/s    If he starts with a speed of 2.22m/s, then:     v = {v(i)^2 + 2gh}^0.5  = {(2.22m/s)^2 + 2(9.8m/s/s)(4.55m)}^0.5  = 9.70m/s    Hope this helps!|`|YKdFnHzcaa	l = length of the vine = 23.8 m  a= angle = 36    cos a = x/l   x= l cos a = 19.25 m  h = change in length = l-x =4.55 m  g= 9.81 m/s^2    using the energy method  PE = KE  PE= potential energy = mgh  KE= kinetic energy = 0.5mv^2   mgh = 0.5mv^2  v= (2gh)= 9.45 m/s    (b)v1 = 2.22 m/s  mgh1 + 0.5mv1^2 =0.5mv2^2   v2=(2gh + v1^2)=9.71 m/s

s4TPXClxaa	A number of ways to do this depending on how you have been taught. The easiest way is to look at the formula masses (molar mass) of the chemicals in the equation.    Work out the formula masses of 2 C4H10 and 8 CO2    This gives you the ratio. C4H10 will always give CO2 in this ratio.    From that work out how much CO2 from 1 g of C4H10 and hence from 100g    Heres a worked example using a different equation (you wouldn't want me to do your homework for you would you :-))    2 C2H6 + 7 O2 --> 4 CO2 + 6 H2O    2 C2H6 is 60; 4 CO2 is 176    So 60g of C2H6 will give 176g of CO2  1g of C2H6 will give 176/60 = 2.933g of CO2  so 100g of C2H6 will give 2.933 x 100 = 293.3g

Assuming that the father is stronger than his daughter, who do you think will feel the greater force?    b.  Assuming that the father is not only stronger, but weighs more, who do you think will feel the greater force?    Any object at rest (the father) will tend to remain at rest unless acted upon by some force.  The same goes for the daughter.  Since she is obviously much lighter, she is the one who is "acted upon" most.  Right?   The father might move backwards a bit, but she is going to fly backwards!|`|GXR2ic5Xaa	The forces they exert on each other are equal and opposite (as per Newton's third law).    Since F = ma, that means that the acceleration each experiences is inversely proportional to their mass. That is, if the daughter's mass is a third that of the father, then she will experience an acceleration three times as big.    Hope this helps!|`|AA11602341	Because they are on ice, you would neglect friction.    a. The daughter would experience the same pushing force magnitude compared to the father.    b. The daughter would experience a larger acceleration due to her mass being lower than the father's but experiencing the same force magnitude. (F = ma)
xT024KMsaa	A recessive gene is one that is not exhibited in the presence of a dominant one. FYI- variants of the same gene are called alleles.     Here's an example. Blue eyes are recessive. The allele for the gene that controls eye color can code for blue, brown, green or hazel. Blue is recessive to brown. Let's take it down to just blue and brown, for simplicity's sake.    So... if your mother has blue eyes- you can assume that hes is homozygous for blue (has 2 copies of the blue allele- 1 from each parent). If your father has brown eyes, we can only assume that he has 1 allele for brown, as it will mask the recessive blue or another color.    If a homozygous dominant person has a child with a homozygous recessive person, the offspring will have both alleles (blue and brown) but will exhibit brown- as it is dominant. A recessive allele will remain hidden in the presence of a dominant one.    It gets much more complex than this but those are the basics. You may want to research Punnett Squares- they will illustrate it much more simply.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	There are some serious holes in your genetics knowledge, I suggest you look into it more, maybe re-read your textbook. In other words, it sounds like you need way more basic information than what can be written here.|`|bMEXTHSWaa	Not at all.  A recessive ALLELE, is a form of a gene which can be "masked" by The dominant allele.  All organisms have two alleles of each gene.  For example for a human the Gene for hair color has two alleles, the dominant B and the recessive b alleles.  If a person has B/B or B/b, they will have Brown hair, as the Brown hair allele masks the presence of the b (Blond) allele.  However, if the person has a b/b genotype, then they will have blond hair, because there is no dominant allele B.|`|R5nwTe2Iaa	For each genetic trait you have two alleles (different versions of the same gene), both of which can be dominant or recessive. For a trait caused by a recessive gene to be present, you must have two recessive genes. Recessive genes are also the reason why some inherited features "skip a generation".

bMEXTHSWaa	Yes.  Because they are heterozygous, they have the recessive allele O in both parents.  Their genotypes are AO and BO, if the child's genotype is OO, then they will have O blood.    Doing a Punnet square, shows that there is a 25% likelyhood of this event.
YrOTZsjtaa	Using Kepler's 3rd law, you can determine the mass of the sun.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	If you put two satellites around Earth, at the exact same distance from Earth, they will orbit at the same speed, regardless of their mass (as long as their mass is small compared to Earth).    This is because things in orbit are falling (in free-fall);  they must go sideways just fast enough so that, as they fall, Earth's curvature curves Earth's surface at the same angular rate.  In this way, the satellite never approaches the ground (it never hits the ground).    This rate of turn stays the same, regardless of the mass of the satellite.    When Isaac Newton developed the formula to calculate orbital speeds, he immediately used Earth's orbital period and distance, to calculate the mass of the Sun, thus proving that the Sun was far more massive than Earth.    That is the argument that changed all scientists' mind about the centre of our system.    Until then, it was thought that the Sun, being made of "fire" was much lighter than Earth.  Therefore,  the was no way that the very light Sun could be the centre of a system that included a very heavy object like the Earth.|`|9Wt6MjVPaa	E- none of the above.
154146d98d9dbb211223b05af3f8c0d5aa	What you might not realize is the water also bulges on the side OPPOSITE the moon.  That is evidenced by the fact that high tides are about 12 hours apart not about 24.  If you think of the Earth/Moon system as one system orbiting the sun, you will notice that even though the Earth is so much heavier the Moon is heavy enough that WHOLE system wobbles around in its path, spinning about the center of gravity of the system. This leads to centrifugal forces on the water. Away from the center of the mass of the Earth/Moon system on the side away from the Moon and attraction to the Moon on the side toward the Moon.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	Gravity, pure and simple.  Plus water is a lot more plastic than solid Earth, so it bulges up higher.|`|Cip9umlOaa	Gravity. The gravitation pull of the Moon causes the Earth's water in the ocean to pull towards the Moon. Thus the bulge. You can use this for your homework (I'm assuming that you are still in school).
xXOnjDNOaa	Indicators are generally molecules whose color will change depending on whether it is in an acidic or basic solution (and often time the amount of color change can be used to quantify just how acidic or basic it is).  Additionally, different indicators will change colors at different pH levels, so if multiple indicators are used depending on which indicators are which color, you can get an estimate of your pH.
KJHw0oI3aa	(b)  This looks like a direct combination reaction with only one product.  The product will be a binary compound made up of magnesium and nitrogen.  In a compound, each magnesium atom will have a charge of +2, while each nitrogen atom will have a charge of -3.  We need to keep in mind that the sum of all charges on the atoms in the formula must be 0.  To achieve this end, we need three atoms of magnesium for a total of [3 x (+2) = +6] and two nitrogen atoms for a total of [2 x (-3) = -6].  The formula of the product will be Mg3N2.    6 Mg(s) + 2 N2(g) --> 2 Mg3N2(s)    (c)  This looks like a double displacement reaction.  Switching ions, we pair up Co2+ with S2- to get CoS, and H+ with NO3- to get HNO3.  So the two products would be CoS and HNO3.    Co(NO3)2(aq) + H2S(aq) --> CoS(s) + 2 HNO3(aq)    (d)  This looks like a combusion reaction.  When an organic compound reacts with oxygen, we expect the products to be carbon dioxide and water vapor.    C2H5OH(aq) + 3 O2(g) --> 2 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l)
S8H5yYcoaa	At least in the Nuclear Science and Engineering program, a master's degree hinges on original research... there is no possible way to read textbooks in the field and come out such that writing an original thesis in such serious sciences is 'a breeze'.    MIT is a really good school, with highly competitive admissions: the requirements for Chem. E. Master's include "Top grades in chemical engineering required, demonstrating ability of students to perform at the highest level" and "Must have had extensive undergraduate course experience in chemical engineering, particularly, thermodynamics, kinetics and reactor design, and fluid mechanics and transport".  I seriously doubt your undergraduate plan adequately prepares you for Master's work in these fields at MIT... I suggest you either major in the field you're eventually planning to pursue, as a mastery of computers is much less important than good recommendations from professors in the field who believe you have real research potential, or that you lower your sights from such lofty goals.

Therefore what may happen, is that more cockroaches may appear as consequence. However, the ghost of the dead cockroach and the cockroaches belief in the supernatural, may prevent others from returning.    To be serious, the dead bodies do not produce a chemical or phenomenal signature which would indicate danger to other cockroaches. The cockroaches do not have sophisticated sensory or cognitive mechanisms to respond to the fact that there is a dead body and then associate danger with the situation.    Having dead cockroach bodies is more a matter of hygiene. The bodies will not discourage other cockroaches. However there are some useful products which will aid in pest prevention. Also look for reasons as to why there are being attracted and try to stop them.|`|mBXu5G5saa	no. they feed on it|`|FMNS3APqaa	Lol, I would think not. They would just eat it....

SvmZlLdaaa	Generally, none. The meat of carnivores tastes unpleasant, which is one of the reasons why most carnivores hunt herbivores rather than other carnivores. If it is hungry enough, a lion will of course eat anything it can, including other carnivores, but they do not form a part of their diet under normal circumstances. They will certainly kill other carnivores such as hyenas, leopards and cheetahs, but do not usually eat them - they kill them to reduce the competition for prey, not for food.     When new male lions take over a pride, they will kill any young cubs of the previous males, and may eat them. They kill the cubs because the average tenure of males with a pride is between two and three years, and it takes a lioness around two years to raise cubs to maturity - she will not mate again until this time. New males can therefore not afford to wait for a lioness to finish raising their predecessors' young before fathering any of their own. By killing the cubs, they bring the lionesses back into breeding condition and can have cubs of their own.    If a lioness's cubs are stillborn, or are killed by disease or another animal, she may eat them. She will lick them at first, as though trying to rouse them, but when the cubs don't 'wake up', it seems to turn into a predatory response (lions often lick their prey before beginning to feed). This may be a way of recycling the nutrients she lost nurturing them.|`|9p7eUgYqaa	They are capable of killing other predators such as leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, and cape wild dogs, though they seldom devour the competitors after killing them.|`|G9GYvNx5aa	if it can kill it it can eat it|`|361f8be8c14edc074d91a2eaebcb5b15aa	Lions will eat whatever they can find and kill, though few carnivores will form a part of this diet.  However, they will eat other big cats, including cheetahs and leopards, when given the chance.  Cubs, especially, are at risk from lion predation.  Sometimes they will kill other big cats and not kill them - basically removing them from their "patch."    Lions will snack on lizards, other small creatures, and when push comes to shove, will take on a crocodile and eat it - though I imagine lions are more likely to scavenge on crocodiles they find dead.  Lions will also eat tortoises (a few species of which occasionally eat worms and bugs, which makes them omnivores at least.)      I'm sure the lion will take its chances with any carnivore crossing its path, though because of the way the eco system is constructed, most carnivores, especially apex predators, tend to give each other wide berth.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	I do not know.  They will kill a hyena on sight and their cubs too.  I don't think they will even bother to eat a hyena.  lions and hyenas are arch enemy's.  I think humans should intervene, in this war on behalf of the lions.  Like maybe bring the parasitic Hyena on to the endangered list.|`|kgppVBj2aa	none really. their packs usually just team up to hunt down zebra, wildebeest, and there's even a pack of 30+ in botswana that can hunt elephants. but no carnivorous animals (they dont hunt hyenas)|`|dDEchJ3yaa	well he eats antelopes, other big cats like cheetahs, hyenas and kinds of animals. :{)

Add '2y' to each side of the equation.  14x + -2y + 2y + 3z = 56 + 2y    Combine like terms: -2y + 2y = 0  14x + 0 + 3z = 56 + 2y  14x + 3z = 56 + 2y    Add '-3z' to each side of the equation.  14x + 3z + -3z = 56 + 2y + -3z    Combine like terms: 3z + -3z = 0  14x + 0 = 56 + 2y + -3z  14x = 56 + 2y + -3z    Divide each side by '14'.  x = 4 + 0.1428571429y + -0.2142857143z    Simplifying  x = 4 + 0.1428571429y + -0.2142857143z
oedelJGdaa	It's Celsius 100%, Canada runs on the metric system = Celsius and the United states run on the Imperial system!|`|IKxY8woIaa	Canada uses real SI units, like the rest of the world except the US. So temp is always stated in degrees Celsius.    (BTW, did you know that the US was all set to go metric at one point, but Ronald Reagan kiboshed it.)|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Celsius...just like most of the world...|`|zILwtO22aa	http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/canada_e....

a86HbDIZaa	A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth blocks the light of the sun from reaching the moon. That means that sun, earth and moon must be lined up perfectly. If the moon is a tiny little bit outside the earth's shadow, we would see a full moon.    So no, a lunar eclipse can only occur during a full moon.    Since the sun is a little bit bigger than a pinpoint, there can be no umbra without penumbra - as long as we're dealing with lunar eclipses.
cHhEC9fpaa	The frequency, f, heard when the source and the observer are in relative motion is given by the Doppler formula:    f = v/(v+vs) f0 or f = v/(v-vs) f0    where v is the speed of sound and vs is the relative velocity. The speed of sound in air = 340.29 m / s. The sign depends on whether the distance between the source and the receiver is increasing or decreasing.     When the motion is towards the car a higher frequency is heard    f = v/(v-vs) f0 = 340.29/(340.29 - 29) 1800 = 1968 Hz    and when the motion is away a lower frequency is heard    f = v/(v+vs) f0 = 340.29/(340.29 - 29) 1800 = 1659 Hz
