20090109233951AAy57zC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians view on Atheism?	Just wondering what the average  christian thinks atheism is all about?   What do you think atheists believe in and what type of rituals and ceremonies they attend.   And if they do not believe in god but are still fine upstanding people of the highest caliber do you think its still right that they go to hell?
20090113210818AAL2wNp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Survey for those of you who think you know agnostics, atheists or evolutionists:?	Asgnosticat asked me for evidence of God, and I've now offered it to him in the form of a 5400+ word essay.      Do you think he'll actually read it with an open mind?      (I guess my real question is this:  do agnostics, atheists or evolutionists ACCEPT evidence, or are they all talk?)
20090111122028AACPZWz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists..is this evidence of God?	Please read all if you want to answer, I don't like answers like "I didn't read the whole thing..your God just doesn't exist..sorry"   I have gotten answers like this, and feel that its just pointless to even answer not having read the entire question. So please, if you answer, I'm assuming you have read the ENTIRE thing.      Okay..before I begin I'm just going to answer these fallacies I get all the time when I post a question like this.      #1:"There is tons of slavery in the Bible, what kind of all loving God would promote this?"       What a straw man, just because there is slavery in the Bible does not mean that it is ordained by God. Just because something is in the Bible does not mean it necessarily is ordained by God. Ecclesiastes 10:19 says money answers everything.       "A feast is made for laughter, and wine Maker merry: but money answerer all thing."-KJV      Since the Bible says that it "must" be ordained by God.(lol) No. This just proves you people clearly do not know how to read the Bible. Yeah, I've visited the infamous website EvilBible.com. Everything about the Bible on that website is just taken out of context. I have spoken to atheists on the web and they tell me that they have read the WHOLE Bible yet they still can't seem to Believe in the Christian(if not a) God. Atheists may read the whole Bible, yet you read it with your mind made up. You read it looking for contradictions yet you can't even see the truth in it. I seldom read the Bible, and when I do read it, I almost can hear God's voice speaking to me. I read it with an open heart, not a biased one. Call me delusional or a "fundie" if you like.You say the Bible was written by primitive men. IF primitive men even existed, according to my study of history, they were really dumb. How can  someone who has the knowledge of a monkey write such epic timeless stories about how to live life?    There is such so much detail put into the Bible you know cavemen did not create such a book out of their imagination.      Fallacy #2: ".Uh...whats the difference between believing in God and the tooth fairy, or zues, or(my favorite) the flying spaghetti monster?      I hear this one SO MANY TIMES!!      ..Basically the difference between believing in God and those things is that IF they did exist, why would you put them on the level of God?   You KNOW these things were merely creations of men, (especially the flying spaghetti monster) and can simply cross out that possibility out. Does the flying spaghetti monster have a Holy Book which prophecies things that are being fulfilled AS I SPEAK? No. It doesn't.      #3: "Why would an all loving God, allow hurricanes, and starving children?" Well that's a good question I must admit, even some Christians(like my mother for example) believe that God is the cause of this.       God allows children to be starving because he allows satan to wreak havoc. We are just born into a bad world, a bad society filled with pornography,(which is extremely easy to access) terrorism, wars and rumors of wars. I think these innocent children who die of starvation will go up to Heaven(considering that if they are ages 1-10) and be with God, and not have to suffer from the sins of man.I lost twin cousins in a miscarriage and know that that is not God.  We are clearly in the end times.Would a loving God give you a second life? Would he warn you about Hell? Would a loving God tell you exactly how to get into Heaven? That sounds loving to me.         Now the "evidence".      Revelation 9-17      "And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat, having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone, and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimtstone." (KJV)      Okay when I first read this, I took it literally.. when its actually metaphoric. Its metaphoric because Saint John the Divine did not know how to describe these thing in the future without the only knowledge he knew back in his time. How can he describe a tank when he lives in a time when people don't  even know what a phone is?   Do you know what I am saying?      So lets break this down..The horses are clearly participating in some kind of war. Since this war has yet to happen, we know they can't be actual horses. To John, the only thing mobile at the time that is used for warfare(besides chariots) are horses. We don't use horse anymore for warfare, we use TANKS! How do I know he is talking about tanks? The last part of that scripture-"...and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone." What modern warfare technology fires fire and smoke? Clearly tanks!       http://www.photochart.com/data/media/12/...       Does that picture not look like the last part of the Scripture? Like I said before, atheists read the Bible looking for the contridiction. They have a biased heart before they even begin to read it. Atheists, apparently you missed something:)      So how can a man see tanks about 1900 year

20090111194730AAKD9nE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How did you come to be a part of your religion?	Were you born into it? If so, have you ever doubted your belief in it?      Did you convert to it? If you did, what age were you, and why did you choose that religion?       Or if you're atheist, were you just born into a family that wasn't religious, or were you raised to be part of a certain religion then just realized you didn't believe any of it?      I'm agnostic, at the moment. My family isn't religious.
20090118085959AAsbqmf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are these verses ' 1 cor.14:34-35' so controversial ?	1 corinthians 14:34-35 " Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.       35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."      they sound simple to me.
20090218080325AAMN8Ii	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is God going to send a delusion so strong, that people will believe it and perish?	Paul says:      2 Thessalonians 2:10-13 (New King James Version)      10 and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, 12 that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.         Sounds like God is mad that people didn't believe in the Lord Jesus, but still, why is God going to send strong delusions(that could be evolution, who knows), that they might believe and perish?

20090117081625AA30ghn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Some basic questions about God (I'll keep asking until I get actual answers)?	If God is Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omni-benevolant;      Why does he require anything of us? He can create anything he wants including a completely subserviant worshipper, why would he need us to do it?      He could have created the universe exactly as he wanted it instantly, why did he take six days,or 13.8 billion years, or however long it took in your religion? For that matter, if he's omnipotant, why would he ever need rest? Wouldn't his power be, by definition, inexhaustable?      Christians, why would God require a blood sacrifice (Jesus) to absolve us of original sin when he could have just forgiven us without any kind of requirement? How often do you require such severe penance for something that's not that individuals fault? Would you require, say, a child to be executed for their (deceased) Grandfathers horrific crime against you?      Why would having a closed heart (or being faithless) stop God? He's God, it comes with the job description that he can do anything. He should be able to get to us atheists whether we have faith or not.      I have a son, I love him, I would not sit back and watch him suffer, even if he caused it. I'm not talking about bumps and scrapes, but things like starvation, torture, or disease. Why, if he truly loves us, does he allow the innocent and blameless to suffer?      If God is omnipotent, why would anything I do be able to prevent God's plan? If he's omnipotent and crafted my soul, he made me the way I am, do you really think God would make me go to Hell for doing what he made come naturally to me (require empirical evidence)?      Why would any God require anything from a mortal? He's God, he can do anything he wants, he doesn't need anybody else to do things for him.      Why would the revelations of an omnicient being be scientifically, historically, or logically inaccurate?      Please, no answers like "It's a sin to question God", just answer the questions above, not with rhetoric, not with blowoffs, not with scripture.      I don't need proselytizing, I'm a R&S regular, I've heard all that before.

20070430072829AAcKKds	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	?Por qué soy gay?	Vivo contento con mi condición y hasta orgulloso de lo que soy. Pero siempre me he preguntado el porqué si jamás fui violado ni seducido, no conviví exclusivamente con mujeres ni con hombres, nunca me llamó la atención vestirme de mujer, no crecí en un ambiente feminista ni machista ni lleno de violencia, me gustaba ser ni?o y los juegos de ni?os, no fui ni el mayor ni el menor de mi familia, ni el más consentido, ni el más debil. Jamás fui golpeado ni obligado a hacer algo que no quise ni viví situaciones que impactaran mi ni?ez; tengo recuerdos muy agradables de mi infancia. En casa siempre hubo la presencia de Dios y nos inculcaron el amor por nuestros semejantes. Viví en un ambiente pobre de gente trabajadora y nunca tuve carencias graves, gracias a Dios siempre tuve para comer. Esta inquietud no me quita el sue?o ni me impide vivir mi sexualidad sin miedos. Creo que ya lo superé. ?Pero por qué soy gay?

20070427170423AAtXzBP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will the hills really melt like wax before that great and notable day of the LORD?	I ask that because I have observed a mud slide in action, although it was one that was caught on tape. And I endevour to say that it looked sort of like when you light a candle and allow the melted wax to build up around the wick, and then, once you got a little bit built up you tip the candle over, and the melted wax begins to run slowly down the side of the candle, and as it cools, it sort of looks like the mud in a mudslide as it liquifies and begins running down the hillside, dont you think? I think that would make a good scientific test in the lab that would maybe give the scoffers of the bible the proof they've been looking for. Sometimes being a poet can help to discern or gleen the meaning of certain passages such as that, that seem a bit far fetched at first. Hills, melting like wax? Ha!

They have the same defeatist attitude as the cultists in HP Lovecraft stories.  They believe that their god is entirely justified in torturing them for eternity, and that they don't deserve to serve his unholiness.        But if they are faithful to to this monster, and humble themselves before him, he may take pity on them and spare them from eternal torment.      Sounds very familiar...

The Bible says:Behold all souls are mine,as the soul of the father also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die.Ezekiel 18:4   People say Satan will have great joy in torturing people forever.   The Bible says:And I saw an Angel come down from heaven,having the key of the bottomless pit and a chain in his hand.And he laid hold on the dragon,that old serpent,which is the Devil and Satan and bound him a 1000 years.Revelation 20:1,2   For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,he also himself likewise took part of the same,that through death he might destroy him,(Jesus)that had the power of death,that is the devil.Hebrews 2:14   People say that Satan is ugly has horns and a tail.

Muslims say that Jesus was a prophet. So how can we explain these verses?      These are the Words of the Son of God in revelation.      Revelation 2:20 By her teaching she misleads my servants.      How can Jesus have servants if he is not God? Didnt Jesus himself say in Matthew 4:10 Away from me satan, For it is written: Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only? Should I serve the Son of God or just God? Or could it be that the Lamb is like God as well?      Revelation 11:18 The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverance your name both small and great.       Are the servants only God's servants or are they Christ's servants too? Or perhaps they are the same?      Revelation 19:5 Praise our God all you his servants.      Im confused, are Jesus' servants the same as God's servants. If so then wouldnt that make Jesus God as well?      Christ said this in Revelation 2:23 Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay you according to your deeds.      Compare this to Jeremiah 17:10      God says I the Lord search the heart and examine the mind, to reward a man according to his conduct, according to what his deeds deserve.      Wow, it looks like the Lamb and Son of God is saying the same thing God said in this verse. Now if he werent God too, this should be blasphemy. Or perhaps he is God in human nature and form?      Revelation 3:7 Christ says this about himself. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.      Compare to Isaiah 43:13 God says this about himself. No one can deliver out of my hand. When I act, who can reverse it?      Revelation 4:8 Each of the 4 living creatures had 6 wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stopped saying Holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.      Revelation 11:17 We give thanks to you Lord God Almighty the One who is and who was.      Compare this with what Christ said earlier in Revelation 1:8 I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.      Another reference is here 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.      Lets look at Revelation at 21:6-7 He said to me it is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the water of life. He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son.       Revelation 22:16 I Jesus have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches.      Revelation 22:6 The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place.      So are they referring to Jesus as the Lord and the God? Certaintly looks that way here. Are you that blinded that you cant comprehend this?

20090309075337AAyQ7J0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Trinity Invented...........?	I have always wondered how the Christians feel about the Council of Nicea because they basically came up with the whole trinity thing.  They were a group of Chruch leaders and bishops that established the trinity as the deity of The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit under one Godhead.       There was alot of controversy about whether or not Jesus was God, and by majority vote, Jesus was ruled God. They also came up with the whole creed of Christianity that everyone must follow.       So how do people feel about the Council of Nicea basically inventing the doctrine of the deity of Christ?      I really hope I am not coming off rude, this is a serious question and I really want to know everyones views.      Thanks!

20090309091051AAcbHzs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Hindus will you continue to live in ignorance or will you understand and apply the Bhagavad Gita to your life?	Most of us fail to understand the message of the Gita. To do one's job without expectation of fruits means to do it for the sake of the importance of the job. If a police officer is motivated only by salary to do the job and not by wanting to see justice prevail in society, he will misuse the job to take bribes and make even more money! The motivation should never be personal benefits is what it means.   Even if you say i want peace. At what price do you want peace?   Arjuna was not an eager warrior and even wished to give up the desire for a kingdom if he has to kill all his cousins and loved and respected ones in battle. That is when Krishna gives the message of the Gita and tells him to fight for Dharma/justice and not for a personal Kingdom for in so doing if he wins and survives he rules justly and if he dies he achieves glory! He talks about what is referred to as a win-win situation by modern management Gurus. You can learn a lot from the Gita.      Yes, Krishna wishes to see Dharma prevail but only for the common good of mankind because they were fighting a righteous war against an unrighteous person like Duryodhana. Duryodhana is a warmonger who does not wish to negotiate peace at all. His father, is not just blind physically but mentally too. In the extreme love of his son Dhritarashtra supports every wrong thing his son does. One has to detach themselves from extreme love and extreme hate and follow righteousness. That is the message. One must fight against injustice in society even if one has to fight against loved ones, family, friends and be willing to even die to ensure that justice prevails. That is Krishna's message in the Gita. Nothing is above Dharma neither self nor family or kin.       Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitah! Dharma serves and protects those that serve and protect it!       If there is justice in society your family will also live peacefully and safe. But if you are weakened by love and for the sake of family, you are not willing to fight for justice, the society becomes ruled by the unjust and your family is also not safe anymore either. Get it!       Look around you, people in India are weak today. In their attachment to themselves, their life, their family, their caste, their state, their linguistic identity, even their country; they do things that spread injustice in society. They give and take bribes to get material possessions for themselves and their loved ones. Nobody is doing Nishkama Karma for the common good of society. Everybody is sick of the unjust society but they are not willing to change their own ways but always blame the system. The message of the Gita is so profound and as valid today as the time it was given to Arjuna, only there are no Arjunas left today to heed the warnings! People have become blinded like Dhritrashtra, lost in love, greed and other weaknesses that destroy the human and the society. We as individuals are the buiding blocks of society and Justice is the strongest pillar of any society.

20090227144529AATDtIy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If a child appologizes and is sorry for what they did wrong.. should they still be punished?	We were faced with a situation the other day with my seven year old and her stealing.. This was the second time. The first time we had a talk that I thought went well, and punished her by doing extra chores.    The thing about this is she came to me and her father and admitted that she had done it. She had taken some money off our dresser to go to town with her aunt.    We did not know really what to do. My husband had told her that the next time, that he was going to give her a spanking. After thinking about it, we realized in real life it would not matter if you went and admitted you stole, you would still have to face the consequences. She is young, but she is very smart. We did our best to explain that to her and she got it. My husband told her that we would always love her and nothing would change that. He also told her she was better than that, she did not have to steal. She was then taken to her room and given a spanking. It was six swat spanking from her father, and I sure hope she learned a lesson. Of course she cried and I know it did not feel good, but I hope this is lesson she will take and learn from. Stealing is not a good thing at all and I do not want to have to deal with it later. I talked to her after the spanking and she told me she understood and promised never to do it again.    Do you agree that even though she admitted she did it she still should of been punished?

In 2007, due to uncontrollable circumstances, my hubby and I got legally married. We only had the required witnesses and no one in our families was notified until after the fact.    My mother in law, a Greek Orthodox, sometimes jokes around saying that what we did was more like a "legal engagement", and we have yet to "really" get married.    Well, I would like to have a religious ceremony to have our marriage blessed in Gods eyes (I was raised Catholic) and was wondering if the Greek Orthodox Church would "Re-marry" us the "proper" way.   is there any kind of process to doing this?    It would mean a  lot to my new family to have this done in the Church, and I love them so much, I would do anything in my power to make them happy.   I have "hit the jackpot" when it comes to my in-laws, and no girl could ever wish for nicer, more loving folk than my new family.   Does anyone know if this can happen?      Thanks in advance for the help.

This is going to sound a little funny, but I've had several nightmares including people saying the words "Morferatus Illuminati", and I have no idea what it means!

I would like to know what it means since I'm so terrified of the words in the dream that I'm beginning to become frightened in real life...      Now, I don't know whether it matters, but the words are usually spoken or written by a man, woman or an icon with a symbol of some sort tattooed on them, it is like a circle with bullhorns and than a cross beneath it, kind of like the symbol for women except it has horns...      the strange thing though is that in my dreams I usually have the same tattoo, but the arms of the cross are different, one becomes a bird's wing while the other becomes a claw and the tail becomes, well, an actual tail...

I'm entirely serious.      The general assumption about heaven seems to be that your soul goes to heaven as you were - in other words, with your personality intact.  I gather that you get to meet the people you knew in life who died before you, as their souls are there as well, assuming they didn't go to hell.  So what about those who haven't had time to develop a personality?  Are they still an infant personality?  Do they instantly develop into a full-grown personality?      I'm not personally a believer, but maybe some of you who are could tell me what you think, or what theologists have decided.

We are facebook friends and is listed as single but makes no attempt to talk to me on there even tho I have sent her a couple stuff. What gives?

Osea, que ahora la ciencia es algo maligno, como en la edad media cuando formulaban leyes (o teorías) en contra de la tierra plana, o en contra de la tierra como centro del universo??

For some reason, when I go to church, I feel all happy and smiley afterwards. It's the kind of happiness that you are so happy, you feel like you're going to die in any minute.

What is that feeling and it seems like it's the biggest happiness I ever have.

Well if God takes my child away before I'm able to teach him or her of God, and they accept and understand his word, how then can he judge them?????

20090309072218AA4cYjQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do Humans have souls?	Hello users of yahoo answers, I am here today to ask you why do you or don't you believe that humans have souls. What are you religious beliefs and what makes you believe that way?      I myself have a very good life with a good family and I don't believe we have souls myself. You could call me an atheist, although I really, really hope there is a God because I think I'm a rather good person. I believe God is manifested in our minds and it's natural to believe in God. If God's possible existence was erased from all minds on the earth, we would come up with something else to fill the space with the same basic idea.      Back to my main question, though, do you or don't you believe we have souls, and why?

20090309090701AA4DwoZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you were taught since infancy that your dad was God, aren't you more equipped to perform "miracles?"?	Now, I'm pretty sure God adopted Jesus because that whole virgin birth thing doesn't really make sense to me. Anyways, if you thought a god was your father, you wouldn't want to grow up to be an accountant; you'd want to spread your word, talk about how proud you are of your dad for creating Earth, etc.      Therefore, if you really, genuinely, believed you had a father/deity watching over you at all time, attempting miracles doesn't seem that crazy. (I don't mean walking on water or anything, but aiding the somewhat injured seems possible - though word of mouth probably exaggerated these feats.) But anyways, the complexity of the human brain gives us the ability to walk on hot coals, lift cars to save our children, etc. So if someone really believed they were the son of God, isn't it possible they performed some sort of minor miracles? (Almost like a placebo...)      Mainly I thought this was an interesting idea, I'd like to see where you guys can take it. All opinions are welcome (even the one that goes something like, "you're going to Hell for questioning that Jesus is the son of God.") Thanks.

20090309092855AA4njOo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can I ask a question about Biblical rules of menstruation?	Leviticus 15:24   "And if any man lie with her at all,  and her flowers be upon him, he shall be  unclean seven days, and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean."      Why doesn't it just say if her husband lieth with her -- because if any other man lieth with her that's a whole other problem, a lot worse than menstruation.   When it says if any man lieth with her, that seems to suggest it would be okay if she wasn't on her period.      Perhaps the Bible could need to be revised a little here?      And anyway what's this whole thing about being unclean?  Does it mean unclean even after you've washed?    .
20090309094608AAO0TA4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can I ask a nasty question, without getting reported?	Leviticus 15:16   "And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then shall he wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening."      Question:    If he washed his entire body, like it says, why is he still unclean?   And what if it's already evening when it happens?      A few verses down it says the woman he does it with is unclean too.       Is this where we got our idea that sex is nasty?      (To my way of thinking, it's church not sex that's nasty; but that's just me.)   .
20090309094504AAOaWlv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think of this testimony from Martin Harris about the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith?	"Do I believe it! Do you see the sun shining! Just as surely as the sun is shining on us and gives us light, and the moon and stars give us light by night, just as surely as the breath of life sustains us, so surely do I know that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God, chosen of God to open the last dispensation of the fulness of times; so surely do I know that the Book of Mormon was divinely translated. I saw the plates; I saw the Angel; I heard the voice of God. I know that the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God. I might as well doubt my own existence as to doubt the divine authenticity of the book of Mormon or the divine calling of Joseph Smith."

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.       2 Corinthians 11:13-15   13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.

Malcolm in my opinion was the sword behind America's back pushing them towards Civil Rights and Equality.

We've told them in no uncertain terms that we like Jesus, we don't like his fanclub! Even Mahatma Gandhi said that! Hinduism has always appreciated good ideas from all directions and we've said, "truth is one people call it by many names".    We have set an example with the Indian Independence struggle of a Christ like non-violent resistance yet the church wishes to see conversions in India. Hindus have followed Christ better than the Christians and have even inspired the civil rights movement in USA.      Yet those who claim to be Christians seek to destroy us. We don't need to convert, we follow Jesus better than you all do!

But, I asked a friend of mine (who is black) if he thought it was offensive and he said.... "What??? Hell NO"   he says that people nowadays want to be SO politically correct its ridiculous!       Are black people offended by that term????  Or, is it ridiculous?????      OH!!! And one more thing.....

20090309101254AADiKLE	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What would you do in my situation?	I've always found relationships on Y/A so damn tacky but I'm going to have to explain this.      Ever since I got with my girlfriend about 9 months and 30some days ago, I have never been able to have good sexy dreams of her when we're apart (3 hour distance between us but only able to get together every few months) instead dreams that she'll leave me or we'd be in a house and we wouldn't be in the same room and I'd struggle to find her all over the place. One even had me so scared and terrified I snapped awake shaking in fear.      That was the last dream. And it was also the day before my period would come so I was acting very hormonal in calling my girlfriend terrified of what is between us.       We are complete opposites; I'm the uptight, fine arts sort and she's the cut-loose, redneck fun girl and I'm going through a new phase in my life with turning 24 later this year and feeling the repercussions of the transition of the early 20s to mid 20s identity crisis. I am also a writer and I'm always thinking about the philosophy of mankind and all she wants me to do is have fun but it's not so easy for me...      She suggested a break; and I found out she finally moved out of her mother's house which is like the den of drug users and alcoholics. Good for her, that house also harbors allot of dark things that has happened to her; rape and all that. She's living in a trailer with her best friend and platonic soul mate (which always intimidates me) along with her daughter and my girlfriend brought her dog with her. She is able to stay there as long as she wants/needs rent-free, only it she goes to school to get her GED and take care of the friend's daughter. I'm apprehensive of what to say to that.      So, her friend who has a cell phone, my girlfriend doesn't, was gone for a few days last week and I was unable to contact her so worst possible scenario pops into my head... that of fear and that she really is serious about a break and I'm a clingy person, especially when I know I found the right person. Hell, she proposed to me!       So unable to know her side; I had gone on the phone with her ex who also happens to my friend. There was no phone sex, no. But there's always this joking sexual tension we have going on and for once it actually turned me on, I think it was because I was so emotionally rigid at the time I needed something to soothe me. Then the thought that I had really cheated on her reached my mind and drove me sick with grief, I over-dramatized to myself and started getting physically sick with shaking constantly. I felt like Ophelia going insane.       Turns out Saturday was a good day for my girlfriend; at least that's what she said in the conversation that night... when she was drunk. She's not supposed to be drinking with all of her health problems and I don't care if I am overdramatizing that bit, she hasn't drank in a while so the first bit she drinks, she slips. I had to come clean even though it was the worst possible timing and she was mad.       She said she was in a good mood all that day even though her friend did not have the phone around and she was all excited for us to be together during my spring break and ready to really get to the core of our problems. I had a full breakdown that night, even though I pondered just going out, get tipsy (it's dangerous for me to drink as well) and just flirt.       Since talking to my friend (her ex) I really felt a release inside of me, whether it was I found whoever it is I'm supposed to be or some sort of confidence (helped when my parents took me shopping that I found some skin-tight jeans that make my legs look phenomenal).       Later on Saturday night, she called back when we both were a little less hysterical and officially agreed on a break. I think before then she talked to her ex about what's going on with her and I found out yesterday my girlfriend said things about she just needs to find out who she is and she is really upset at me. Yesterday her friend added salt to the wound saying that I was dumb and immature but knowing my girlfriend she probably snowballed the situation making it bigger than it really was. I had to self-depricate myself which hurt me more than anything with agreeing to her friend's texts to me saying, "Yeah I was stupid and I made a mistake." I never adhere to someone insulting me and I do that only for my girlfriend. Since yesterday my body has been shaking convulsively, even while I decided to put away everything that reminded me of her. I even took off my promise/engagement ring. I feel naked now.      I decided if she ever calls me, let her call me. I told myself I wouldn't attempt to obsess over these things. Next to my bed I put up the Celtic Commandments to instill my spirituality, plus going to an Ostara festival this weekend. Thing is though, how to move on from all of this but at the same time find some peace in being involved in a break. I've always found it easy to feed off of other peoples thoughts because I'm such a na

I'm asking because my as much as I love my dad (step-dad), he's the only "father" figure I've known since I was young, Im happy that he retired and reclocated, because our family was miserable being together.       My family consist of my mom, my twin, rabbit, and him.      Now, he retired and left as he's 15 years older than my mom, hates the US and has family down in central america. He loves it there, he's only here to file taxes and fix a couple of things regarding financies and then he's leaving, but it could be like 2 months.      I love him, but I know its better than we're not together, my mom can remarry, and I don't have to come home to him being miserable and always being negative and in my business, which really pisses me off, as I have other things I'm dealing with right now.      How do I handle him for the time that he is at home?...   I go to college and work, I have a place im moving into in the fall.    But for the mean time, I thought I'd just find ways to keep busy, be nice to him, but not over do it, *** I can sense tension in my house with him being around**, he's a great guy, but its better for us to not live with him, he just causes us misery with his attitude.

20090309094026AAtZ1Ac	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Wonder if god will bother to intervene on this one? Or is he too backed-up on prayer requests for cars $ stuff?	(CNN) -- A Saudi Arabian court has sentenced a 75-year-old Syrian woman to 40 lashes, four months imprisonment and deportation from the kingdom for having two unrelated men in her house, according to local media reports.      According to the Saudi daily newspaper Al-Watan, troubles for the woman, Khamisa Mohammed Sawadi, began last year when a member of the religious police entered her house in the city of Al-Chamli and found her with two unrelated men, "Fahd" and "Hadian."      Fahd told the policeman that he had the right to be there, because Sawadi had breast-fed him as a baby and was therefore considered to be a son to her in Islam, according to Al-Watan. Fahd, 24, added that his friend Hadian was escorting him as he delivered bread for the elderly woman. The policeman then arrested both men.      Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism and punishes unrelated men and women who are caught mingling.      The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, feared by many Saudis, is made up of several thousand religious policemen charged with duties such as enforcing dress codes, prayer times and segregation of the sexes. Under Saudi law, women face many restrictions, including a strict dress code and a ban on driving. Women also need to have a man's permission to travel.

20090309094808AAI0NmS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Jesus 'really' care about poor people?	I have often thought that belief in god is based upon the social status of the victim.   For example, I am of a superior class, so I never go without basic needs such as tootling along in my Rolls, bespoke tailored suits and an abundance of intelligent fillies. Whereby, a commoner from the gutter class attend a place of work for over 40 hours a week purchase clothing from charity shops, drive shoddy cars and call everyone 'mate' as they are less worthy in society.   I mean, whereas I give to charity on occasion, eat fine meat and pastries, attend private drinking clubs and live in a manor with swathes of rural land, opposed to a poor person that live in squalid bedsits, drink cheap ale, attend rough looking drinking venue's with people who have a 'job'    Am I right to believe that my superiority to commoners presupposes a greater significance to the good lord with matters in hand?

When I first started posting here I was probably a deist. I had a belief in God or Higher Power. But after seeing all the stupidity in the posts of those arguing for religion and Gods existence, I find that I can't  really believe in the existence of God anymore. Anytime I try to think of a God, someones idiot post just comes to mind and I am reminded how idiotic the concept really is.       This really is not the result of any great persuasive argument by an atheist, but from all the lame posts from those that think they know that there is an afterlife or God.      Just wondering if anyone else has had the same experience.

So I am asking how can a homosexual be a sinner for homosexual sex if God made the person homosexual?      I am not asking why church or Paul or David or whoever you want to bring up had to say about it.  I want God's own words to explain why God would make someone gay but then frown upon gay love.

20090309114142AAJjUQ5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Christians' asking their evolution questions here, not in biology, prove they don't really want answers?	I've seen what creationist websites tell Christian creationists to do: ask the same dozen questions over and over, refuse to listen to any answers, then pretend there were no answers, ridicule everyone for having no answers, and then continue asking those same dozen questions. Those dozen questions are spelled out for them, too, such as why there are still apes, don't evolutionists just not want to be accountable to god, isn't it just a theory, don't evolutionists have more faith than Christians, etc. The fact that they do this proves they don't want answers, they just want people who already agree with them to go, yeah, that's right, huh huh! Anyone who truly wanted to have questions pertaining to evolution answered would ask people who actually know something about evolution, not their fellow dogmatic, prejudiced scientific illiterates.
20090309142004AAJkuCr	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How has coming here to Y!A affected your life?	I remember the first day I joined on here, back in November 2008. It hasn't been long, but it seems so. I first noticed Oberon in this section. I remember thinking, woah, this guy has great honest answers to the questions he answered. I came back every day, asked and answer. I mostly asked about stuff that pertained to my personal life and all, and I've gotten really good feedback. I do ask the occasional fun question here and there, but I was really after the words of wisdom that could be added to mine own.       At first, my intentions were just to ask, answer, and learn. But little did I know there would be friendships that evolve from visiting this site regularly. It's hard to say, but it's like the bonds are getting tighter and tighter, even though I may not know everyone on a personal level. In fact, I don't believe I know anyone to that extent. I do know some people's real names, despite the controversy of giving it out. I sometimes wonder how far can some of these friendships go sometimes.       I realize that many people come here, looking for answers to their questions, or to ask a question they need advice with, but in turn, they don't understand that they've walked into a place that can bring so many magical people into their lives.       I love where I ask/answer at. I feel like we have our own online family/community or somewhat, and it's a rather accepting one.

I'm not like any kind of kung fu master or nothing like that, but i always thought that if a girl would ever go and try to slap my face that i would just reach out and block away their hand. Not hitting them back, but just blocking it so when they try to slap it won't work. Well, this girl did try to slap me, and what i thought doesn't work. But that's because she used some tricky move on me that totally confused me so i couldn't move at all. She stood right in front of me and was standing with a hip out and a hand on it.

"The survey concluded that 'high levels of organic atheism are strongly correlated with high levels of societal health, such as low homicide rates, low poverty rates, low infant mortality rates, and low illiteracy rates, as well as high levels of educational attainment, per capita income, and gender equality. Most nations characterized by high degrees of individual and societal security have the highest rates of organic atheism, and conversely, nations characterized by low degrees of individual and societal security have the lowest rates of organic atheism. In some societies, particularly Europe, atheism is growing. However, throughout much of the world -- particularly nations with high birth rates -- atheism is barely discernable.' "

20090309151406AAv4Yv8	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Is this any good? it is suppose to be really scary?	A man went to a hotel and walked up to the front desk to check in. The woman at the desk gave him his key and told him that on the way to his room, there was a door with no number that was locked and no one was allowed in there. Especially no one should look inside the room, under any circumstances. So he followed the instructions of the woman at the front desk, going straight to his room, and going to bed. The next night his curiosity would not leave him alone about the room with no number on the door. He walked down the hall to the door and tried the handle. Sure enough it was locked. He bent down and looked through the wide keyhole. Cold air passed through it, chilling his eye. What he saw was a hotel bedroom, like his, and in the corner was a woman whose skin was completely white. She was leaning her head against the wall, facing away from the door. He stared in confusion for a while. He almost knocked on the door, out of curiosity, but decided not to. This disinclination saved his life. He crept away from the door and walked back to his room. The next day, he returned to the door and looked through the wide keyhole. This time, all he saw was redness. He couldn't make anything out besides a distinct red color, unmoving. Perhaps the inhabitants of the room knew he was spying the night before, and had blocked the keyhole with something red.      At this point he decided to consult the woman at the front desk for more information. She sighed and said, "Did you look through the keyhole?" The man told her that he had and she said, "Well, I might as well tell you the story. A long time ago, a man murdered his wife in that room, and her ghost haunts it. But these people were not ordinary. They were white all over, except for their eyes, which were red."

Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 53, Number 325:      Narrated 'Aisha: (mother of the believers) After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity)." Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle got angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of Allah's Apostle.      Sahih al Bukhari Bab al Adab, Volume 8, Book 73, Number 100:      "Narrated Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari:   Allah's Apostle said, "It is not lawful for a man to desert his brother Muslim for more than three nights. (It is unlawful for them that) when they meet, one of them turns his face away from the other, and the other turns his face from the former, and the better of the two will be the one who greets the other first.".

20090309114828AAiHnT9	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is this idea for a House Guest Party sound fun and mature? Would you try this food?	Well im planning on having a party. A House Guest Party.   It is based on the show "House Guest"   What we do is im inviting 6 people to come and eat in my house, then after eating and partying each member will draw a toothbrush, the one who gets the secret "house guest" toothbrush gets to stay the night!   Does that sound fun and mature?      Now my foods, are more exotic.   My friend said "some people might not try them" but a co-worker said "id try them all! i think anyone would whos not boring!"      Here are some of the more exotic of my ideas.   "Spicy Punch"   Normal punch with spices like coriander and herbs.      "Pork Scratching Soup"   tomato soup with some pork scatchings on top and a few bits of hot dogs inside      "Lamb Icecream"   Some normal vanilla icecream with a tiny bit of lamb grinded on top.      I have some more ideas but those are the most exotic         The only normal thing to choose from shall be "tomato soup" incase anyone is feeling boring.         And as a special suprise for my houseguest in the morning im going to give a fruit smoothie with a bit of garlic.

20070611134554AAx213T	Society & Culture;Languages	Pinyin is Chinese society?	How seriously is pinyin taken by Chinese society?      When a westerner visits China, would  print material (books, news papers and magazine) be available exclusively in Characters?      Do the Chinese make provisions for people that are not inclined to learn the character system (either foreighners or other Chinese citizens) by making print material in pinyin ?      How pervasive is the use of pinyin in Chinese society beyond simple street signs and maps for lost tourist?      Chinese is very much worth learning, but I am trying to figure out if, after all my effort, I will not be able to "read" any relevant Chinese print material (ie news papers), given that I am not inclined to learn characters but would be willing to learn pinyin??      Thank you very much

20090309115813AAPbGgc	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How can I cope with life as a dark-skinned black woman?	I know this question has been beaten to death on the yahoo answer board for quite some time now, but please bear with me.      I am a 26 year old, very dark-skinned black woman who has been ridiculed for my skin tone for most of my life. Just the other day, I was at my boyfriend's house and his father's friend referred to me as midnight because I was very, very black. I wanted to bust him upside his head with that bottle of Old English he was drinking.  I mean, who says that??!! He doesn't even know me?! My boyfriend jumped in telling him "Stop, she doesn't like that." The guy jumps in saying, "Oh, but you're that 'pretty black' (like it made it any better)." At this point, I just stormed off into the house and locked myself in the bathroom with my drink, trying to fight off tears. It also didn't help that his father didn't come to my defense. He actually instigated the situation by saying "You don't want to hear what he said about you" which in turn led him to elaborate on the whole "dark skin" issue.      To make a long story short, I am still brewing over this incident and I need help building myself up. Every time someone makes a comment like that, it still hurts me so badly.       I'm just so tired of this sh**. I'm tired of feeling like some sort of an alien because I'm always the darkest one in the room. And why do people always have to throw in that I'm a pretty dark girl and not just plain pretty.      Sorry to ramble again. Can someone please suggest ways that I can bring up my self-esteem? Even better, perhaps some articles, personal stories, or books that I can read to help me feel less alone.      Thanks for your help.
