Hola tengo un problema espero me puedan dar alguna informacion seria, vivo en Italia y quisiera que mi mama venga para el verano (viaja sola), el problema es que a causa de malas experiencias por parte de las aerolineas, mi mama tiene panico de perderse o que le cancelen el vuelo o que se le presente algun problema en el aeropuerto de Madrid (Barajas) ya que debe hacer escala y tomar otro avion para Bolonia, la pregunta es conocen alguna agencia de ACOMPA?ANTE para estos casos, por que el servicio ofrecido por las aerolineas es solo para discapacitados y no esta garantizada para personas como mi mama que tiene 65 anos pero no tiene ningun problema fisico, el servicio seria ayudar a encontrar la puerta de embarque y acompanarla hasta que tome la conexion de ida y por supuesto de regreso, les agradesco de antemano es de verdad importante si no encuentro a alguien no vendra!!

20090309090051AAkjdZm	Travel;United States;Boston	Questions for UMass Boston students (accomodations & commute)?	Hello,      I'm looking for some information neighborhoods and commute for UMass Boston students. The UMB.edu website is kind of vague...         Basically I know the geography from maps and a little bit about the T and Back Bay area from a Christmas visit... but I'd like to know a little more.      I have family who live in a building right above the Back Bay station and I kind of want to live near them... however some neighborhoods (like Dorchester) are so much more affordable so I'm also considering that despite it being further.  Though I have heard some bad things about the neighborhood like that it can be kind of dangerous in some areas.      Anyway, UMass Boston students, where do you live and what is your neighborhood and commute like?  Do you drive a car or rely on public transportation?

Now going back home, we called the aairlines to have our seats reserved but the person we spoke with told us that we couldnt get the bassinet on the plane because our baby has her own seat and it is only for lap babies. Should we just get a refund on her ticket and get the bassinet they have? she doesn't stay on her carseat anyway so what do you think? our last plane ride was horrible! they seated us on the middle aisle and there was this man beside my husband who keeps on coughing and doesnt even cover his mouth.

My rent is over $1200 a month for a one bedroom plus utilities and that was literally the cheapest thing I could find. I actually used to work for Archstone Apartments right by the Pentagon and one bedrooms started at $1800 a month, $90 for parking, utilities averaging $125 a month..tack on cable and whatever else and it was well over $2000 a month! I am looking at other areas..I'm sick of DC traffic, DC weather, and DC PRICES!! Everyone here lives paycheck to paycheck, most people have to take up second jobs in order to have any money left over. I know I shouldn't complain because there are plenty of people getting laid off and fired left and right, but how is anyone supposed to make it with these conditions? Not to mention the weather here SUCKS! It was 80 degrees and humid yesterday and they are calling for snow in the next few days..there is snow still on the ground from a snow storm we had last week..Can anyone tell me what the best area would be to move to in terms of cost of living/wages ratio? With decent weather?

20090309104743AA6mS8o	Travel;Caribbean;Other - Caribbean	Which Sandals Resort would you recommend/not recommend?	My husband and I are looking to take a better-late-than-never honeymoon. We are wanting something all-inclusive preferably couples-only because we don't really want to deal with kids, nor do we want it to be too much of a party/"spring break" atmosphere. We're in our 20's. We're mostly looking to lay around on a pretty/clean beach, drink fruity alcoholic beverages and spend a lot of time in our room. As long as the food is okay/edible, we won't complain. It'd also be good if there was some kind of bar/nightlife included as well. We were thinking Sandals but if someone has a better suggestion let us know!! Thanks for your help.

20090309150350AAvv8V1	Travel;United States;Denver	Vacation in Colorado Springs.?	So I had planned to go in a vacation to Colorado and rented a cabin that fits 7 people for $1,800.        I rented it for an entire week from April 13th  April 19th.        My dilemma is that I'm not able to go on those dates anymore and so I don’t want to loose the trip I can’t change dates or get my money back.       Is there a website where I can post it, and maybe someone will want to go on this vacation?  I would only ask for $500-$800.  That would be saving someone over 1k.      I have all the details.  There is a massage included free dinner at a restaurant.

20090309101239AA0fMlR	Travel;Africa & Middle East;South Africa	Question as far as a US citizen getting robbed abroad in South Africa?	I am a United States citizen living abroad with my South African wife and our 5 month infant daughter awaiting my marriage visa to go through back into the US.    A few weeks ago a criminal robber came through our bedroom window and stole a laptop computer and 2 camera's while my daughter and wife were fast asleep. Thank goodness neither one of them were harmed but the robber has not been caught and now I am unfortunatly finding out that the house owner who told me he was going to look into insurance, will not be covered for this specific robbery.      My main question is as a United States citizen holding a US passport, visa debit card, and drivers license have any rights as far as international insurance claim and if any actions can be taken for this most unfortunate event?

20090308120916AAKmRvc	Travel;United States;Kansas City	What is a party in the western area like Kansas like? Story Ideas!!!!?	What is a party in the western area like Kansas like? Story Ideas!!!!?   I'm writing a story that mainly takes place in Kansas and some city, but i'm making there be a party, i want it to be western like and i don;t know what to call it. Also, if you have any ideas of what i could add please tell me, it's actually a movie script and the plot is that a family in Kansas has lived there their whole life, very rustic out in the country living in an old farmhouse with a vegetarian farm, they dont believe in killing animals, then a twister comes and destroys their crops which is where they made all their money, the husband applies for a job in New York, NY area, where there are beaches and sunshine,and plenty of places to shop, the children have never been on a vacation and it is a completely different place for them, it is very populated and they are used to plain open areas, a small community where they know everyone! They try to adjust, the children attend a school which is new to them because they were homeschooled. I hope one day it will be a motion picture! Thanks for your help.

20090309115410AAaCZaH	Travel;Mexico;Cabo San Lucas	Im going to Cabo San Lucas for Spring Break, is it safe to go?	So me and my best friend Patty are both going to Cabo San Lucas RIU Sante Fe 5 star hotel/resort. Alot of people have been putting crazy thoughts in our heads about the drug wars going on in Mexico but from what im reading its all on the borders of the united states and mexico and mostly in Tijuana. Cabo is said to be a very rich summer spot to go and if you stay in the resort you should be fine. I just want to know if it really is safe to go to Cabo and stay in teh resort and not go to the clubs but just drink in the hotel. Everyday my friend keeps telling me she wants to back out and not go but if she doesnt go i dont go and thats over $1300 dollars in the garbage.
