750114d15c8548fd7799c30eb4760991aa	Wow, that totally depends on what kind of food you like and your budget.  I like to use the Yelp website to search by category (top rated, breakfast, location etc.).  Here are my personal favorites:<br>  <br>  Matt's El Rancho - their slogan is "The King of Mexican food" and I have to agree. Great food, great atmosphere, good margaritas and reasonably priced!<br>  <br>  County Line on the Hill - you have to eat at County Line. It's a requirement to be an Austinite, lol. I love the one on the hill for some reason. Don't go just for BBQ. You can get cheaper, better BBQ, but you won't find a place that has charm, views, good drinks, big honkin' beef ribs, delicious homemade bread and their BBQ is certainly satisfying. My favorite - the grilled chicken breast!<br>  <br>  North By Northwest - this place never disappoints. I take a lot of business people there at lunch and there's a wide variety to choose from and always good. I love their cedar plank salmon!<br>  <br>  Cypress Grill - great Cajun food in a strip mall in SW Austin. Don't let the location fool you, these guys know what they're doing.<br>  <br>  Fonda San Miguel - not a place you would go all the time, but its great for special occasions. Excellent food, atmosphere and service. Love the mango margarita!<br>  <br>  East Side Cafe -They grow their own veggies out back! I love the setting in the old house.<br>  <br>  Pappadeaux's - gasp, I know it's a chain, but the Pappa's restaurant chains have a recipe for success and it's one of the few places to get decent seafood in Austin.<br>  <br>  Azul Tequila - another strip mall atmosphere with outstanding Mexican food. They have both interior style and Tex-Mex for all tastes. <br>  <br>  Springhill - really good fried shrimp and catfish. If you're going to indulge in fried food, this place is it!<br>  <br>  Fish City Grill - just discovered this place and can't wait to try it again.
tY1gSfN4aa	yes!!! i love me some taco bell!|`|myG2hhaKaa	I don't like Taco Bell. I guess it's because I am just not a huge fan of Mexican or cheesy foods in general. The one by me does seem dirty (and I rarely say that about an establishment) but there are some nice ones out there. It could just be the one by me- that gives off an aura of dirtiness.<br>  <br>  The food itself, isn't presented very attractive either.|`|ZjYLTdovaa	dood. if you live near a Mi Hacienda .. ditch that taco crap and get yourself a REAL BURRITO! best things ive ever had in my LIFEEEEE. but baja fresh > california tortilla > taco bell.|`|6C287vmdaa	Taco Bell is THE BEST fast-food place EVER!!!!|`|4Uj2SJP1aa	I only like all their chicken stuff,    that's the only stuff i'll eat.

tY1gSfN4aa	they're both amazing!! i'd rather have a slurpee if i was up north, but a frutista if i was in the south i guess...the best would be to alternate everytime, cuz they're both so good lol|`|AA11330407	Neither! I do love fruit smoothies but they have to actually have fruit in them and not a bunch of artificial colors and flavors.

wAl9knNzaa	If you're up for a really good time, one where the waiters and waitresses might give you a really hard time, like throwing napkins at you if you ask for one, then try Dick's Last Resort, had a wonderful time there and the food is good.|`|x5mDmNlOaa	for breakfast there is "hash house a go-go" on 5th in hillcrest..............you get A LOT of food................becareful with the biscuits.they will put you to sleep!|`|pbV7dnKKaa	Oh yeah there are a lot of good places. If you want to try food that is a little different than the ordinary you can go to Daphne's Greek Restaurant.

WpH9zProaa	I live in the Bay Area. Here are some good ones.<br>  <br>  San Francisco - Scomas (a little pricey depending on what you eat but delicious and right on the water)<br>  <br>  Berkeley - Skates on the bay (good prices and your right on the water)<br>  <br>  Oakland - Scott's (on the water delicious but a tad pricey)<br>                 Everet Jones (Yummy and it's in Jack London Square)|`|9bdEPcWIaa	This site never fails me, reviews by real diners and websites for menus and other info.<br>  <br>  www.yelp.com|`|e09c29e02c529cc3d6dcd562b81fd01faa	Well, one really good one I recomend is Scott's Seafood in downtown San Jose, at the top floor of the Hilton. This is if you are willing to splurge a bit. An average entree is around 35-40 dollars. Their aged steak is a must, and they have a delightful collection of red wines. If you go, you HAVE TO order their icecream sundae for desert. It is heavenly. <br>  <br>  For a budget of 25/entree, I would say Red Lobster, or Cheesecake Factory, and you can never go wrong with Buca di beppo. All three of these are located in many places in the Bay Area, and are all reasonably priced. <br>  You can check out the web sites for these four recomendations if you wish: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scottsseafood.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.scottsseafood.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.redlobster.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.redlobster.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bucadibeppo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bucadibeppo.com/</a><br>  <br>  good luck!  and hope you and your husband have fun  =)|`|40c2dd53f8275fb6c6f6e563c70a669eaa	25 to me is expensive per entree but anyways. You will enjoy a restaurant and a walk through Santana Row. Very upper class feel and it is overall romantic. Check the website to find a suitable restaurant you would like. I recommend Magianno's.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	Oh that is a nice gesture! Usually Italian restaurants tend to be the most romantic depending if you go to a nice one or not. I typically look in an online yellow pages, they help a lot finding places like that!
ncojw5ttaa	You could consider Ames Plow Tavern an underground pub. It's in Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall. You have to go down stairs from the outside/street level to get there. I wouldn't recommend it though. It's really small and a dive. No one goes there.<br>  <br>  There are some bars in Faneuil Hall that have a lower/basement type level in addition to other levels. Sanctuary and McFaddens are ones that have a downstairs with a dancefloor. Trinity also has a downstairs that has been turned into a small comedy club.<br>  <br>  There are also places outside of Faneuil Hall that have a downstairs dance floor. The Harp is one of them and also a fun time.|`|FiF7XXWqaa	Quincy Market (or Faneuil Hall) is in Boston.  It's right next to the MBTA (also known as the T) Orange and Green Line station called Haymarket.  There are a ton of pubs in that area, although I can't say that I know of an underground dance club there.
En0r0UQ3aa	El Floridita is a nice salsa supper club with live band.  I've given you a live jazz list below to help you decide what's the most convenient for you.|`|tEWOUrVpaa	You want dinner and dancing, take her to a strip club during happy hour :-)

qot19U8jaa	I think the Polynesian Cultural Center's luau <a href="http://www.polynesia.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.polynesia.com</a> is the best luau in Honolulu. It's a bit of a trek to get there (located on the North Shore) but if you want a real luau experience you need to check it out. It's funny when people don't consider the PCC luau to be in Honolulu because it's on the North Shore but the whole island resides under the City and County of Honolulu. Anyway, just my thoughts and opinions. Have a good vacation!|`|aa1OGptZaa	I would agree that Germaines Luau is a good one.<br>  Some other must sees you should have on your to do list in Honolulu are Hanauma Bay, USS Arizona, taking the Atlantis Submarine underwater tour is fun, and eat a malasada at Leonards Bakery.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	I went to Germaine's Luau. Tons of people there, and the show was good.  (Poi tastes bad, by the way!)<br>  Here's a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hawaiiweb.com/oahu/activities/germaines_luau.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaiiweb.com/oahu/activities...</a>|`|wn1KKbXQaa	We've been to the luau at the Polynesian Cultural Center as well as the one at Paradise Cove.  The food at the Polynesian Cultural Center is far better. The only thing is that you can't get any alcoholic drinks there (no matter, the alcoholic drinks at the other places are watered down anyway), and the Cokes that they serve are caffeine-free.
l9c2Uw5baa	Condos are scattered throughout the city and you should very easily find something within that price range, or less.  <br>  <br>  You don't necessarily need a vehicle, but that depends on where you live.  If you live downtown, no you don't.  However if you are outside of downtown I recommend one.  It's always easier to have a vehicle with groceries etc.  That's a personal taste though, you could potentially get around on the transit system alone, it's pretty reliable.<br>  <br>  Toronto is highly multicultural - you will find people from all over the world here.  Very active city, great attractions etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toronto.ca/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.toronto.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toronto.com/</a>|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Downtown Toronto ("Trawna") is easy to travel using the mass transit, but with a 4-year-old, that can be a little tricky.  I'd consider living in the area near Bay Street & Bloor Street.

Darden Restaurants for example which includes popular names like Olive Garden and Red Lobster will provide food for events like this and or provide door prizes in the forms of Gift certificates or Gift cards.

G0QugnQ8aa	I hadn't eaten them until just recently and now I'm pissed off at myself for not getting them on my Pizza SOONER...yum|`|8nZtWHiBaa	i like them on pizza... with olives weirdly|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	I do, on pizzas with the works.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I love anchovies on pizza, in putanesca, in pasta sauces, and plain.  You can get anchovies at any grocery store ... look for them in the 'Italian foods' aisle as well as the 'canned fish' aisle (tuna, salmon, etc.)  If your store doesn't carry them, try looking on-line at any good Italian stores.  You can buy them packed in olive oil, packed in 'brine' (basically with salt and water added), and in 'dry jars.'  I prefer the dry jars kind, but your tastes may be different than mine.  To get them 'dry' you can drain them individually on several paper towels.  Another good and very tasty way to eat anchovies is to mix them with cream cheese and spread them onto crackers ... I was 16 when I tasted my first anchovy ... my grandmother had them 'rolled up' and stabbed them with toothpicks because she was having a party with a guest who loved them.  There were a ton of them, and tons of other food, but the anchovies 'disappeared' first ... it turned out there were a lot of anchovy lovers at that party/reception who had never seen them 'served plain' like that.  My husband was a professional chef and has many 'recipes' for dishes with anchovies in them ... which he makes just for me, because he really doesn't like them.  He does make great calimari (squid), though, and I gobble that down (he gets to eat the tops, though ... I swear they 'wiggle' even though they're dead squid) and a 'mixture' of anchovies with their 'extra saltiness' and calimari with it's more 'plain flavor' make a very powerful 'main protein' ... it's Lent, and we should eat more fish, so I'm looking forward to a lot of 'feasting' during this 'fasting' season!|`|UBxKqdPwaa	I tried them once and found that it is a good way to ruin a pizza.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	Anchovies are great!

AjN6QGWvaa	1893 was the attempt by Queen Liliuokalani to promulgate a new constitution which would have strengthened the power of the monarch relative to the legislature in which Euro-American business elites held disproportionate power. The conspirators' stated goals were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.[9][10] About 1,500 armed local (non-native) people under the leadership of the Committee of Safety, a 13 member council, organized the Honolulu Rifles to depose Queen Lili?uokalani. They took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a Provisional Government.<br>  <br>  As these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu.[11] United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, advised about these supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property[12] by the Committee of Safety, obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the USS Boston and two companies of U.S. sailors to land on the Kingdom and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. 162 sailors and Marines aboard the USS Boston in Honolulu Harbor came ashore well-armed but under orders of neutrality. The sailors and Marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served effectively in intimidating royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, "the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself."[13]<br>  <br>  A provisional government was set up with the strong support of the Honolulu Rifles, a militia group which had defended the Kingdom against the Wilcox Rebellion of 1889. Under this pressure, to "avoid any collision of armed forces", Lili?uokalani gave up her throne to the Committee of Safety. Once organized and declared, the policies outlined by the Provisional Government were 1) absolute abolition of the monarchy, 2) establishment of a Provisional Government until annexation to the United States, 3) the declaration of an "Executive Council" of four members, 4) retaining all government officials in their posts except for the Queen, her cabinet and her Marshal, and 5) "laws not inconsistent with the new order of things were to cointinue".[10].<br>  <br>  The Queen's statement yielding authority, on January 17, 1893, protested the overthrow:<br>  <br>      I Lili?uokalani, by the Grace of God and under the Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the Constitutional Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional Government of and for this Kingdom.<br>  <br>      That I yield to the superior force of the United States of America whose Minister Plenipotentiary, His Excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared that he would support the Provisional Government.<br>  <br>      Now to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life, I do this under protest and impelled by said force yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall, upon facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representatives and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the Constitutional Sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.

It is the total value of all final goods and services produced in a particular economy; the dollar value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a given year.[1] GDP can be defined in three ways, all of which are conceptually identical. <br>  <br>  First, it is equal to the total expenditures for all final goods and services produced within the country in a stipulated period of time (usually a 365-day year). <br>  <br>  Second, it is equal to the sum of the value added at every stage of production (the intermediate stages) by all the industries within a country, plus taxes less subsidies on products, in the period.<br>  <br>  Third, it is equal to the sum of the income generated by production in the country in the period—that is, compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, and gross operating surplus (or profits).<br>  <br>  GDP = consumption + gross investment + government spending + (exports ? imports), or,<br>  GDP = C + I + G + (X ? M).|`|AA11701565	The gross domestic product (GDP) is one the primary indicators used to gauge the health of a country's economy. It represents the total dollar value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period - you can think of it as the size of the economy. Usually, GDP is expressed as a comparison to the previous quarter or year. For example, if the year-to-year GDP is up 3%, this is thought to mean that the economy has grown by 3% over the last year.<br>  <br>  Measuring GDP is complicated (which is why we leave it to the economists), but at its most basic, the calculation can be done in one of two ways: either by adding up what everyone earned in a year (income approach), or by adding up what everyone spent (expenditure method). Logically, both measures should arrive at roughly the same total. <br>  <br>  The income approach, which is sometimes referred to as GDP(I), is calculated by adding up total compensation to employees, gross profits for incorporated and non incorporated firms, and taxes less any subsidies. The expenditure method is the more common approach and is calculated by adding total consumption, investment, government spending and net exports.<br>  <br>  As one can imagine, economic production and growth, what GDP represents, has a large impact on nearly everyone within that economy. For example, when the economy is healthy, you will typically see low unemployment and wage increases as businesses demand labor to meet the growing economy. A significant change in GDP, whether up or down, usually has a significant effect on the stock market. It's not hard to understand why: a bad economy usually means lower profits for companies, which in turn means lower stock prices. Investors really worry about negative GDP growth, which is one of the factors economists use to determine whether an economy is in a recession.
