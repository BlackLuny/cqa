xIisVcLTaa	The speed we orbit the Sun is calculated easy enough, as someone else already showed.<br>  <br>  From where you can "see" this speed would require you to be out of our local frame of reference. In other words, you would have to leave the earth, and accelerate in a direction opposite to our orbit until you are no longer orbiting, but then you would also have to account for the fact that the Sun's gravity would pull you in, so you'd have to fire thrusters in order to compensate for this. At some rate this would balance, and then you could watch the Earth move smoothly in orbit, behind the sun and then back towards you. <br>  <br>  Not that there aren't other reference points from which you could view or measure the speed, this is just one example.

If the Earth were to orbit the sun in a circle, the Earth's speed around the sun would be constant.<br>  because the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the speed of the Earth varies throughout the year. The speed of the Earth is fastest when it is closest to the sun, in January, and slowest when it is farthest away from the sun, in July.

For most of you it will be hard to understand the system from the first time, if you do not have thermodynamics knowledge it will be harder. <br>  My theory is to look at the refrigeration cycle from another point of view and I will call it (heat extraction -rejection cycle) to achieve the perfect system ever created. <br>  My system will produce green free electrical power, free cooling, free heat and free water at only maintenance cost an initial cost, Seems impossible yes but it’s not.<br>  Heat extraction -rejection cycle <br>  1- Evaporator where the refrigerant will extract energy from the air =Qex Heat extracted from the air.<br>  2- The compressor will compress the refrigerant to high pressure and high temperature this means it will give the refrigerant energy which is Qcom= Qcompressor.<br>  3- The condenser will reject the heat to the environment Qrj=heat rejected<br>  4-  Qex=at least 2 to 3 times Qcom <br>  The heat was rejected to the environment Qrj=Qex+Qcom. =3 to 4 Qcom<br>  Practical example a split unit 7kw cooling capacity will consume 2.85 Kw electrical power this means heat rejected from this unit will be 9.85kw <br>  Qrj=Qex+Qcom<br>  Qrj=7Kw+2.85Kw=9.85Kw<br>  This means that we used 2.85 kw electrical power and we get 9.85 kw heat power.<br>  How about spending 2.85kw and getting 9.85kw? <br>  This is the first application of the theory to use the cycle for heating not for cooling at the same time you will have your cooling. <br>  That was the simple application of the theory the complicated cycle for electricity power, heating, cooling and water production for free will be as follows.<br>  The same cycle I explained will produce 9.85 Kw which will be extracted to produce super heated fluid which will run a turbine to produce electrical power let’s assume that this turbine efficiency is only 45% that means we will produce 4.43 Kw of electricity the rest 5.42Kw which still in the fluid will be extracted to heat water. the 4.43 Kw electricity will provide our compressor with 2.85 Kw and we will have 1.58 Kw electrical power to be used any way we want. At the same time we will have 7 Kw of cooling capacity which will produce also water from condensation.<br>  Result.<br>  We provide the initial 2.85Kw to start the system then we turned the power off. When the system starts we are getting the following.<br>  1- 1.58 Kw electrical power (7)<br>  2- 7   Kw cooling capacity(1)<br>  3- 5.42 Kw heating power(5)<br>  4- Condensate water(1) <br>  Where did we get the power from? We extracted the power from the atmosphere <br>  A practical thing we can do is using the simple cycle as a boiler for heating water instead of burning fuel, fuel burner for heating prepossess should have been obsolete long time ago. <br>  Note: the figures above are not according to a study they are an actual A/C unit data (only as an example).|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	generating electricity from the fridge motor?<br>  sure you can, but would it be worth it? no. you will generate less power than you use.<br>  <br>  Reverse a fridge heat pump? possible in theory, not too practical in practice unless you have a lot of experience, and even then it will be cheaper to buy a real heat pump.<br>  <br>  .

Because of this, we really only ever see one side of the moon (it wobbles a bit, but only a few degrees around).<br>  <br>  So the moon appears lit up when the angles are such that the point you are standing on is facing the moon, and that area of the moon is also being illuminated by the sun. <br>  <br>  But the 'dark side' of the moon will never be facing us because of the tidally-locked orbit, so while it is illuminated at times, we never see that side from Earth.|`|doTAhSGBaa	The Moon makes one rotation every 29.5 days, which is also the same time it takes it to complete one rotation around the Earth.<br>  <br>  If it didn't rotate around its axis, we would see different sides, but it rotates at such a rate that it makes up for the discrepancy.

Because of the changing positions of Sun, Earth, and Moon, these are only the same when the Moon is full. The far side can't be seen because the Moon's rotation is tidally locked so that one side always faces the Earth. This means that the Moon's rotation period (on its axis) is the same as its revolution period (time to travel around the Earth in its orbit). This also happens with many other moons in the Solar System.<br>  <br>  The dark side of the Moon is the side facing away from the Sun, the main source of light in the Solar System. We see the dark side almost every day of the month, as the Moon is lit from all angles except directly overhead (Full Moon). And we can literally see it, even though it is dark to sunlight, by sunlight reflected from the Earth. This is particularly noticeable, even to the naked eye, when the Moon is a narrow crescent, but is visible in a telescope virtually any time in the month except near Full Moon.|`|rvRimbVYaa	Objects you see you can see them because of light and their reflection of colour they give. But sometimes when our world orbits around the moon it orbits round the part of the moon where light of the sun does not reach so I guess that is why but still some light travels there so that if you have a powerful telescope you could see that part.|`|KHSOVxViaa	We can!<br>  <br>  Look at the moon whenever it's not full.  Part of it is dark.<br>  <br>  It's the far side we can't see.  Just like we can't see the far side of the earth because the ground gets in the way.<br>  <br>  The moon points one face at us all the time; technically its rotation is in synch with its orbit.<br>  <br>  In both cases we could see it by going there...|`|zQiwHJV6aa	All surfaces of the moon receive equal amounts of light over the lunar cycle.  I think a more correct term for the 'dark side' would be the 'far side' of the moon.|`|QIbGs38faa	its too dark

6Z6sMqOQaa	Hello. Nice to meet you!<br>  Let me start by saying that i don't like many of the answers posted here. Let me quote one: "its a cycle; universe expands to its limit, collapses in on itself, big bang, rinse and repeat." This is an outdated answer because now we know the so called "dark energie" that is making the universe expanding at an accelerated rate. That will most likely lead us to the Big Rip - which says that in the last minutes, stars and planets will be torn apart, and an instant before the end, atoms will be destroyed. <br>  Your question makes sense, but as you know we can't say what was "before" the Big Bang --> that's why we say it created time and Space. You can think of what was before it, but we will never know because we're trapped in this horizon, we can't see before the Big Bang, if there was something before it was probably destroyed so your guess of what was "before" is as good as mine.<br>  You can think of it as a Bubble. We can't know what is "outside" the bubble, we're "trapped" in it.<br>  I hope this helps! See you you around. <br>  Best regards|`|rvRimbVYaa	No in chemistry there is a rule Matter cannot be created but nor destroyed but recently they found out that if scientists reach the absolute 0 of kelvin scale -275 kelvin scale it is about this things become destroyed or created but they cannot reach it by 2 'C but now that they are going to do or did that experiment of big bang i assume they reached it. <br>  <br>  but it is better to do some Research based on what i told you you will know more|`|zQiwHJV6aa	You can't ask what's before time.

We can consider it an event, say event 1. We also can deduce that for any event to occur, some other event has to cause it. (Consider a ball, dropped from a height. The ball touching the ground is to be considered an event. Theoretically, there are an infinite number of events to cause this event, but I'll consider only one. Someone gripped off the ball, at an height. This is the event which caused the latter event.). Also, for any event to occur, space and time are the requisites, and no exceptions are possible. (These are not assumptions, but just axioms.) <br>  Hence, the event which caused event 1, had to exist, and exist in space and time. Let this event be event 2. But event 1 marks the beginning of time. Event 2 occured after event 1, as demostrated. But when event 2 caused event 1 to occur, how can it occur after event 1?  It's like saying the ball touched the ground before it was left. A contradiction arises between these axioms because of our wrong assumption that space and time began at a defined "point". Hence, I conclude that space and time are infinite. Conclusions drawn:<br>  - Big Bang didn't start space and time.<br>  - Space and time are eternal. There is nothing materialistic beyond eternity...<br>  <br>  If you find my answer confusing at the first read, try reading it again, maybe 2 or 3 more times, and I hope you'll get over it... <br>  <br>  HTH|`|f37d6304fac14bf76b4ba0afcdc87e09aa	There was......GOD.

8ibfyEP5aa	Paracetamol consists of a benzene ring core, substituted by one hydroxyl group and the nitrogen atom of an amide group in the para (1,4) pattern.[22] The amide group is acetamide (ethanamide). It is an extensively conjugated system, as the lone pair on the hydroxyl oxygen, the benzene pi cloud, the nitrogen lone pair, the p orbital on the carbonyl carbon, and the lone pair on the carbonyl oxygen are all conjugated. The presence of two activating groups also make the benzene ring highly reactive toward electrophilic aromatic substitution. As the substituents are ortho,para-directing and para with respect to each other, all positions on the ring are more or less equally activated. The conjugation also greatly reduces the basicity of the oxygens and the nitrogen, while making the hydroxyl acidic through delocalisation of charge developed on the phenoxide anion.

Well, don't worry. <br>  Theoritically, you just have to get "branches" from your main electricity and gas supplies in your flat building, and you should have your own meters to measure your electricity and gas utilization.<br>  For electricity, make branch from electricity line runs from electricity pole to house pole. That branch line goes to your flat, interrupted with KWh meter.<br>  For gas, make branch from main gas pipe outside directly to your flat, interrupted with meter.<br>  If too difficult for you, find technicians eg. via internet. Find qualified ones with good quality, and cheapest prices.<br>  Eg. find in Googlesearch: "install KWh meter in Newport area" and "install gas meter in Newport area" and "install gas pipe in Newport area", etc.. You have to trust them anyway. Hopefully you'll find many of them.<br>  For electricity, DON'T FORGET TO INSTALL MINI CIRCUIT BREAKER (MCB) TO PREVENT FIRE. Install electricity without MCB could cause fire when shortcircuit happens.<br>  Thank you very much Newport Harb Fan.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	Do you have a question?  what does "sorted out" mean?<br>  <br>  Why not call the power company and gas company?

A neighbor may show you a utility bill with the phone number(s).  Call the companies with your name and complete address (including flat) and ask to be connected.  There may be a connection fee as well as a deposit (perhaps returnable after a year or so when you establish a good record at paying your bills on time).  You should locate your own gas and electric meter (which may have an identifying number) to check against your first bills to be sure you are correctly charged for the flat you occupy.  If you leave the flat, be sure to contact the power companies again to discontinue service, to be sure you are not billed for the next tenant's service.

PDcnXgE6aa	All synchronous motor starts as an Induction motor and than after reaching rated speed, we switch on dc field ........so starting time of both Induction and synchronous will be same<br>  <br>  switching off may takes very long time, at it totally depends on load..........may be up to 10-20sec when fully loaded<br>  and     100 seconds at no load|`|4fWZL4TRaa	The speed you mention is the typical slip speed for a 50Hz induction motor. The synchronous speed is 1500 RPM etc for 50 Hz, or 1800 RPM etc for 60 Hz. Maybe you meant an induction motor (the rotor is a squirrel cage type). A synchronous motor has a magnetic rotor, like an alternator used as a motor.<br>  <br>  Synchronous motors...<br>  The starting time depends on the situation. There are various methods of starting them. They have to be spun up to synchronous speed by some means such as an external motor, wound rotor, or perhaps acting as an induction or commutator motor, so starting torque depends on the method, and the starter control. Some are very big, used to correct reactance on a grid fo example, some small like in a video recorder. Similarly the inertia etc depends on the motor (and any load). You need to consult with someone who knows about the specific motor and its starting method.<br>  <br>  Video recorder brushless...<br>  The small type in a video recorder uses sensors to detect the rotor position and switch the field coils accordingly, so strictly speaking they are a brushless DC motor. You can say they are synchronous speed at any RPM. These use 3 sets of windings in the armature (3 phase rotating field) and permanent magnets for the field.<br>  <br>  Induction Motors...<br>  A single phase induction motor needs a starting method, such as a 90 degree phase shifted start winding providing a second phase at least for starting. Some have a wound rotor with commutator even (it is shorted once running). Three phase induction motors will come up to speed without any starter, just connect power. A starter is often used to make it start more gently. In this case the time to start depends on the power applied and the load. A load like a flywheel (a crusher plant maybe) can take a long time to build up to speed - maybe a minute - but the current has to be limited during this period to protect the motor. On the other hand there are plenty of Direct On Line (DOL) starters which get it going in a few seconds with low starting torque loads like a fan or pump.|`|AA10008098	That would depend upon whether the motor is under load or unloaded.  A synchronous motor (synchronized with the frequency of the power source) develops torque only when the rotor slips (revolves at less than synchronous speed).  It must slip to carry a load.  If the motor is unloaded then the only 'load' is the mass of the rotor (that should come up to speed very quickly relative to the horsepower available).

With these medications, unless you have other medical conditions that need to be considered, I would try either 1.  If it doesn't work you can try another in the same class.  But it is basically trial and error with these medications.|`|3JUKOGOvaa	Paxil and Lexapro are both ssris but are completely different.

AA11513203	As others have said, *nothing* in science is "beyond any shadow of a doubt" ... and that is precisely why science is so powerful.    Anything ...  and I mean *anything*, even a "fact" ... is subject to revision and reexamination if new evidence comes to light.<br>  <br>  The existence of a force called 'gravity' is not "beyond any shadow of a doubt".

Do not forget the fact that humans *ARE* apes.   This is not a "fact" of observation, this is a fact by *definition* ... like the fact that "Neptune is a planet."

It is understood from the Quran, revealed over 1,400 years ago, that there is both; "Creation" and "Evolution." And in both instances, it is only Allah who is "Able to do all things."<br>  <br>  Allah has explained how He created everything in the universe and brought all life out of water. He created humans from earth (not monkeys) and there is no need to attempt fabrications of "links" to the animal world in Islam.<br>  <br>  The Quran says that Adam & Eve were created in Heaven, and NOT on earth. When they disobeyed God, He expelled them from Heaven, down to Earth.<br>  <br>  "And Allah has Created every animal from water; of them are some creeping on their bellies; some walk on two legs; and some on four. Allah Creates what He wills: for sure Allah has Power over all things."<br>  [Noble Quran 24:45]<br>   <br>  The Quran has set a precedent 14 centuries before modern science, explaining in simple and direct terms about his "creation" of animals and their various functions and then assures us it is He who has the Power over everything. This statement includes the fact Allah can if He Wills, reshape and alter his creation as He Chooses. There is clear evidence within many species of alteration and changes within the species. However, there is no concrete evidence to support a cross over in development from one type to another, such as reptiles turning into birds or alligators turning into cows. The statements made in Quran are quite clear when Allah tells us of having brought forth other life forms and then destroying or replacing them with others. This again, does not imply evolution in the sense of one type becoming or changing into another.<br>  <br>  Allah tells us He is Al-Bari, (The Shaper or Evolver) but once again, this does not mean He has a need to bring about each individual life form all from one kind. Actually, while reading the Quran you learn He has brought many types and shapes and sizes as He Wills. Changes within species occur even as quickly as one or two seasons, not even taking a whole year, much less millions as was supposed by Darwin.<br>  <br>  Speaking of Charles Darwin, he was only an amature naturalist and had only observed the finches (birds) on the Galapagos Islands for the first time in the mid 1850s. He noticed that on each island the birds had different shaped beaks according to the type of food available on their particular island. For this reason, he assumed, the birds had progressed over millions of years and only the hardiest of the species had survived the climate and vegetation changes. However, this is totally inaccurate and was dismissed as a mere humor in a TV series on the educational channel in October of 1998. According to the scientists’ discoveries in that very same year, the effects of the weather phenomenon known as El Nino, the climate on these same exact islands had drastically changed in a single year within a number of months. And to their surprise, the eggs of the finches on each island hatched open producing birds with beaks already altered to accommodate the changes of their environment.<br>  <br>  The commentator even said this shoots Darwin's theory completely down and he laughed.<br>  <br>  There is no DNA research pointing to a connection between apes and humans as was supposed by the scientists and those who had financed them over the years. In fact, the barnyard pig is closer to humans in many aspects, than a monkey or a gorilla. Consider the fact, doctors use the skin from pigs to replace needed tissue on burn victims and the famous movie actor, John Wayne had a pig's heart valve installed in his own heart in a 1977 operation to save his life. It worked, too - until his smoking caused him to die of cancer.<br>  <br>  The rational approach to the whole subject is rather simple. Just as He is able to Create the universe and bring forth life, it is simple also for Him to produce as many different types of forms of life as He Wills. No problem for Him, after all - He is the Creator and He is the Shaper. And most important, He can change anything as He Wills - even today.|`|u0kK3RUtaa	Of course theres a shadow of a doubt because no one was there to vouch for it and say 'yes ive witnessed this adaption occur'.<br>  <br>  However it is the best scientific explanation we have so far. <br>  <br>  Do some re-search on Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism, you'll see what i mean.

But on the balance of probability, all the evidence suggests that we evolved, not FROM apes, but WITH apes, side by side, from a single common ancestor, itself also a product of evolution.<br>  <br>  What you get taught in school seems to depend upon where you live. Americans seem to be taught a lot about creation/"intelligent design". If anyone other than an RE teacher mentioned creation in a British school, that teacher cannot expect to keep his job. He can only mention creationism if a pupil asks specifically about it, and must qualify it with a statement that "some people believe God created it all", while teaching evolution as a scientific fact. I prefer the British way.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Probably you should consider where the water in the rivers is coming from?<br>  <br>  The only way the rivers can get water is from the rain and snow, and that comes from clouds. The clouds come from water evaporated from the sea. So, the amount going back to the sea and the amount being taken out of the sea are roughly equivalent. <br>  <br>  The only thing that messes up the equation is, how much water than rains on the land will stay there as permanent ice.  Glaciers, like in Greenland, hold a lot of old rain and snow water that got frozen many thousands of years ago. So if they melt, that old rain will at last return to the sea, so the sea will be a little higher --- suppose it is only 1% higher --- since the sea is roughly 10,000 feet deep on average, then 1% rise would be 100 feet. <br>  <br>  Get out your rubber boots!|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	The atmosphere continually picks up water moving it around and depositing on mountains where it melts and runs down again as water.<br>   If the polar ice caps melted you could suppose the sea levels may rise.<br>    It may take a long time before we can make an accurate assessment of what is really going on.

All weekend they went to the library.  They did this for the entire term. They didnt watch one minute of tv, see one film, go to one dance, for two terms. They got the highest marks in their organic class.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	That is kind of a confusing question... do you mean, what is the chemical formula for vinegar?<br>  <br>  Vinegar is a liquid that is made up mainly of water with acetic acid added. If it is natural vinegar, there may be a mixture of different acids. <br>  <br>  Some micro organisms produce acetic acid as a waste product when they grow. So, for instance, if yeast is put in grape juice without much air being available, then the yeast could ferment the grape juiice and turn the grape sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide - that is, into wine. But afterwards, if the yeast get some air (like if you leave the cork out of the bottle) they can oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid and the wine becomes vinegar.  You can get the formulas for any of these compounds by using google....|`|b29ca58124f000e217215499c9d45f66aa	distillation|`|ee58c093533eaad6190a4f532772bfb9aa	Vinegar and what?
p0SOWgb5aa	Not really.<br>  I respect sharks for what they are, powerful apex predators that have the potential to do serious harm to humans. I have a healthy fear of them, in that I wouldn't swim up to one and grab its fin but I've been cage diving with Great Whites and it was great, I was actually surprised that I was not more scared- it seemed like the sensible sentiment to have but I was mainly just awe-struck. I wouldn't want to free dive with them but I realise that the likelihood of being attacked by a shark, even a great white, is less than winning the lottery, so I do not worry too much...<br>  The second picture is a goblin shark, and that is one I would be the least scared of, they are deep sea sharks (the first was caught at a depth of 900m or so) for a start so you would be very unlikely to see one in the first place. Those type of teeth are also not made for shearing through flesh but to grab onto fish. Its size means it could be potentially dangerous to humans but we are unlikely to encounter it and it's teeth are not made to grab mammal prey so the risk of it attacking us is minimal.

An intravenous injection would flow back to the heart for distribution through all the arteries.  an intra-arterial injection would flow toward the limb, etc. served by the artery in concentrated form before being returned to the heart by veins for general distribution.

k5ZEeSKJaa	Not without more information.<br>  <br>  If the water is in a container (i.e. the environment itself is not the conatiner) you will need to know the coefficent of heat transfer for the material the conatiner is made of.  The water will freeze faster in a tin cup, for example, than in a styrofoam cup.<br>  <br>  You would also need to know the thermal density of the environment.  Lower thermal density materials will take longer to freeze the water, since the water will warm the environment more.  So water will freeze slower in -130 degree air than if poured directly into -130 degree metal.<br>  <br>  If you know all the variables, though, you can calculate it.|`|AA12042710	Look into Newton's Law of Cooling.

If the diver ascends too fast, these gases form bubbles, resulting in decompression sickness.<br>  <br>  Clouds which hold their maximum amounts of water vapor are supersaturated and will rain once the equilibrium is irritated.<br>  <br>  In air that is supersaturated with water, water droplets may precipitate upon being disturbed.

AA11942172	Magnetic field direction is preserved mostly in the mineral magnetite that is present in most rocks. Nevertheless, in order to preserve the magnetic field, magnetite must align or crystallize following the earth magnetic field of the time. There are two basic ways to do this.<br>  1) sedimentary rocks,<br>  2) in igneous rocks.<br>  <br>  1) In sedimentary rocks you have to look for fine grained sedimentary rock, a fine grained sandstone or finer. The typical sand found at the beach will not work, that is too coarse.<br>  <br>  2) Igneous rocks: Crystallization of magnetite in lavas would be very useful. Crystallization of magnetite in plutonic rocks will not work very well.<br>  <br>  The finer the grain of magnetite in your rock, the better it will retain the paleomagnetic data you are looking for. If you have coarse magnetite it'll form different magnetic domains and it gets complicated. <br>  <br>  You also have to consider and be aware of later hydrothermal events that can re-magnetize your rocks (by precipitating new magnetite, or by oxidizing magnetite to hematite or maghemite).<br>  <br>  Other magnetic mineral to consider is pyrrhotite which is not as common. Maghemite is more common (but a lot less common than magnetite, fortunately) and is easy to re-magnetize, becoming a nightmare for paleomagnetists.|`|2a7bfedd529d64d55e216a90bb921c42aa	as far as I know the magnetism in rocks is formed when they cool from being lava.  as they cool the atoms line up to face north and south in turn determining the field for that individual rock.|`|442763124989a15f7d29c3871c407a26aa	The seabed rocks and many mountains have revealed many facts of earth's magnetism..<br>  for one, (and most spectacular) that it keeps changing its poles.<br>  Well, the rocks are mainly of igneous rocks of lava origin ..

The fuel is made of carbon and hydrogen atoms, so when it burns it makes carbon dioxide and water vapor (H2O) as the waste product. When the water vapor is shot out the back of the plane it condenses into fog and leaves a cloud trail. Usually there is wind that rapidly spreads out the cloud but sometimes the atmosphere is very still and the trails can be seen for a long time.<br>  <br>  There is some worry about the amount of water vapor that jets are putting into the high atmosphere.

Among these, pentamerids first appear and are abundant, rhynchonellids, and the spire-bearing athyridids and atrypidids are also common, as are other groups that continue from the Ordovician.<br>  <br>  Tropical reefs are common in the shallow seas of this period, formed by tabulate and rugose corals, stromatoporoid organisms, bryozoa and calcareous algae.   Trilobites, cephalopods, gastropods, and echinoderms. The Trilobites, having reached their acme in the Cambrian and Ordovician, are now in decline.

The single-spined Monograptus is the predominant genus, and its species are useful as zone fossils.<br>  <br>  Towards the end of the Silurian, there was a series of three events of which the most significant was the LAU EVENT. Here, it is apparent that most major groups suffered an increase in extinction rate during the event; major biotal changes are observed worldwide at correlated rocks, with a "crisis" observed in populations of conodonts and graptolites ."|`|De4vgWXPaa	There wasn't a general decline of invertebrates.

GHrzxJUbaa	The debate came to a head in 2006 with an IAU resolution that created an official definition for the term "planet". According to this resolution, there are three main conditions for an object to be considered a 'planet':<br>  <br>     1. The object must be in orbit around the Sun.<br>     2. The object must be massive enough to be a sphere by its own gravitational force. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape of hydrostatic equilibrium.<br>     3. It must have cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.<br>  <br>  Pluto fails to meet the third condition, since its mass was only 0.07 times that of the mass of the other objects in its orbit (Earth's mass, by contrast, is 1.7 million times the remaining mass in its own orbit).The IAU further resolved that Pluto be classified in the simultaneously created dwarf planet category, and that it act as the prototype for the plutoid category of trans-Neptunian objects, in which it would be separately, but concurrently, classified.<br>  <br>  On September 13, 2006, the IAU included Pluto, Eris, and the Eridian moon Dysnomia in their Minor Planet Catalogue, giving them the official minor planet designations "(134340) Pluto", "(136199) Eris", and "(136199) Eris I Dysnomia". If Pluto had been given a minor planet name upon its discovery, the number would have been a little over a thousand rather than over 100,000. The first minor planet to be found after Pluto was 1164 Kobolda, a month later.<br>  <br>  There has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the reclassification. Alan Stern, principal investigator with NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, has publicly derided the IAU resolution, stating that "the definition stinks, for technical reasons."Stern's current contention is that by the terms of the new definition Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be excluded. His other claim is that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Marc W. Buie of the Lowell observatory has voiced his opinion on the new definition on his website and is one of the petitioners against the definition. Others have supported the IAU. Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Eris, said "through this whole crazy circus-like procedure, somehow the right answer was stumbled on. It’s been a long time coming. Science is self-correcting eventually, even when strong emotions are involved."|`|ffJcrsmLaa	This question is outdated; Pluto is no longer considered a planet.

I'll assume you know the fake coin is heavier than the others.<br>  <br>  Make 3 groups of 4 coins.<br>  <br>  Group 1 = 1, 2, 3, 4<br>  Group 2 = 5, 6, 7, 8<br>  Group 3 = 9, 10, 11, 12<br>  <br>  Measure Groups 1 and 2.  If they are the same, then the coin is in Group 3.<br>  <br>  If they are not the same, the coin is in either Group 1 or Group 2.<br>  <br>  Assume the coin is in group 3 (Groups 1 and 2 are equal).  Put coins 9 and 10 on one side and 1 and 2 on the other.  If this balances, the coin is either 11 or 12.  If not, the coin is either 9 or 10.<br>  <br>  For simplicity's sake, let's say the scale does not balance.  Leave coin 1 on one side and 9 on the other.  If these balance, your fake is coin 10.  If not, it is coin 9.  Perform a similar experiment with coins 1, 2, 11, and 12 if the scales do balance.<br>  <br>  What if Groups 1 and 2 are not equal?  Then the coin is in the heavier of the 2 groups.  Determine which coin is fake by performing the same steps as above.

Still, you might want to check with a doctor.<br>  <br>  Also, if you get a small wound later, clean your wound by removing any foreign materials that got inside (e.g. sand, small fragments of rock, etc) and also the blood that bled from the wound.

That's why you never hear about UFOs observed by astronomers or meteorologists; they're only reported by people who are unfamiliar with what can be seen in the sky. I've been an amateur astronomer for over fifty years, and have never seen anything in the sky that I haven't been able to identify.<br>  <br>  Although life almost certainly exists elsewhere in the universe, the immense distances between stars makes interstellar travel practically impossible.

K6QlFoo0aa	Your data is categorical.  The zookeeper is hardly going to compare the weights of bay elephants to those of baby foxes.<br>  <br>  The only truly appropriate graph type is a "scatter plot", also known as a "scatter diagram".<br>  <br>  I have uploaded a picture of a scatter diagram with two types of data.  For this problem one could be the weight of baby foxes and the other the weight of baby coyote.  Those weights would be sufficiently similar as to appear on the same scale.  Normally you would use a scatter diagram for only one animal type, but from this you can see what a two type scatter diagram looks like and from that you can see what a one-type scatter diagram would look like.  The pink squares could represent the baby foxes and the dark "diamonds" (really diagonal rhombuses) could be the baby coyote.<br>  <br>  To see this picture click on the following link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo133/gerryrains/ScatterDiagram.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo133...</a><br>  <br>  An analysis of some type would then be performed on each set of data.  In the case of baby elephants (very rarely born in zoos) there would probably only be one data point or none at all and no analysis could be performed other than recording the weight.  The other graph types simply would not work out.  The data could be of any or no type of distribution - normal (also known as (aka) Gaussian after Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), the super-genius aka the "Prince of Mathematicians"),  binomial, etc.  These data are not nice.  I would expect that for each species that the weights might take on a normal (Gaussian) distribution.  That may be more than you want to know about Gauss, but he is usually considered one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time (and I studied some of his works during my graduate school days).

xIisVcLTaa	This could be a really involved question if you want it to be. <br>  <br>  Short: Technically there is some delay associated with live TV. Since the signal is typically bounced off a satellite and then back down to Earth. <br>  <br>  Longer: The camera (assuming digital) has a CCD detector. This reads photons which are being bounced off whatever it's pointed at. So you produce a digital feed of video (and sound by other methods). This is then transfered into an electromagnetic wave which will have some method of encoding the information (such as modulation to produce binary 1's and 0's. This could be amplitude or phase or beats or even polarity, I'm not sure what they use because I'm not an engineer) This is shot up at the satellite which is really just a fancy space mirror. <br>  <br>  Because it's an electromagnetic wave at this point, it can travel at the speed of light.Still, this is finite, and the distances involved are relatively large inasmuch as there could be fractions of a second to transmit, and then whatever delay was initially associated with detection/encoding)<br>  <br>  Then the waves come back down to a detector (lets say an antenna). The waves cause the detector to vibrate and the vibration is characteristic of the wave signal which means you can interpret changes in the stream such as aforementioned beats/phase/polarity modulation. After it's converted back into a digital signal, it's ready to be produced on your TV. <br>  <br>  I'm not actually sure about the encoding of the information, but everything else is more or less right.<br>  <br>  edit: It occurs to me that for really long signal broadcasts (IE China to US, you would have to either bounce the signal off a satellite, back to Earth, back to satellite in order to get it around the globe, or satellite to satellite if such precise technology exists)|`|134385d0efc35bde8e1ef958b8c734d4aa	This TV Box.

sQLyyCY0aa	First, on the 1% question.  The statement is usually formulated:  "We only use 10% of our brains.  How would it be if we could use 100% of our brains?"  The 1% statement is a corruption of that.  The fact is, whether 1% or 10%, the statement is false (with a little research on the web you can find its origins).  Various brain imaging technology shows that we use essentially 100% or our brains all the time, even when we are asleep.  Roughly 50% of it alone is dedicated to visual processing, and a big chunk more is committed to processing other sensory modalities.  So you see that the 10% claim can't possibly be true, much less the 1% claim.  Where the question arises is _how_ we choose to _use_ our brains.  But that is altogether another question, LOL.<br>  <br>  Next, on the question of belief in extraordinary "mind powers" (I presume you mean things like ESP and PK?).  Leaving aside for the moment the question of whether or not such things exist, the fact is that most people DO believe in "mind powers."  National polls on the extent of belief in the existence of various paranormal phenomenon, especially ESP and such, show that consistently at least 60% of the general population does believe in such things.  The number has been declining in recent decades, but is still a majority.<br>  <br>  Finally, do such powers exist?  Despite many of the answers you have received to this question, the answer is yes.  There is a large and growing body of well-supported evidence that humans possess what commonly are called extra-sensory perceptual abilities.  The best evidence is rigorously scientific, and (like most science research) it sometimes takes some effort to read through the papers that document it.  But it is worth looking into, so I have included some internet references below.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The 'only using 1-10% of your mind' thing is a load of crap.

Frauds, liars, boasters and the delusional,seem to be all we have.|`|FisVYasvaa	The question I am answering is "Why don't most people believe in mind powers?" not "Is there such a thing as mind powers?", just so you know before you read this whole thing.<br>  <br>  The answer is that most people don't believe in anything that they can't see, hear, smell, feel, or taste.  These people are narrow-minded and refuse to believe anything that another person says, regardless of logic, unless it happens to agree with what they already believe.  These people may occasionally be intelligent, but are intellectual dwarfs.  "Intelligence" is "the ability to learn or understand from experience, or the ability to acquire and retain knowledge"(whoop-dee-doo, you have a brain).  "Intellect" is "the ability to reason or to perceive relationships, differences, etc.; power of thought; great mental ability".  Truly smart people are intellectual, not simply intelligent.  Take Albert Einstein, for instance.  He was an intellectual.  He did not see, feel, hear, smell, or taste any scientific evidence, yet he was able to use math and logic to discover the Theory of Relativity.  Of course, like all great intellectuals, the "intelligent" people all considered him a "quack".  But, how true were his scientific equations!  All due to his great intellect, not his intelligence, for, as it turned out, he did NOT do too well in school.<br>  <br>  Skeptics, or people who don't believe in something, can be in one of two categories: the arrogant skeptic, and the logical skeptic.<br>  <br>  The logical skeptics are those that seek the truth and wish to discover what is correct and what is erroneous.  The logical skeptic will use known facts and reasoning to arrive at a personal conclusion(theory), then seek evidence or conduct an experiment<br>  to test his theory.  There's nothing wrong with logical skeptics as long as their logic is sound.<br>  <br>  The arrogant skeptics, which unfortunately are numerous, are fools.  They will say, "There's no such thing!  It doesn't/they don't exist!" despite having no proof to the contrary, believing that a lack of proof is enough, ignoring all thought process, logic, and reasoning.  Their opinions must be discarded; they are nothing but useless vanity.<br>  <br>  As for whether something exists or not, there is a scientific fact known as the Law of the Universal Negative(for those of you who have read my answers before and are frustrated of hearing about the Law of the Universal Negative, in your face, you peons, it's science, and it's fact).  It is IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT SOMETHING DOESN'T EXIST.  You can't because, simply, you are not omnipresent and you are not omniscient.<br>  <br>  Saying that something doesn't exist goes against all logic, and is completely arrogant and conceited.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the answer to "Is there any such thing as...?" is "Possibly".  The answer cannot be "no"; it is either "yes" or "maybe".<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, how do you ask a question on Yahoo! Answers?<br>  <br>  --[To Paula H] The "knot you get in your stomach when you see someone else with an injury" is not a result of your mind/body being part of the world around it.  It is one of two things: 1. It is the "sick" feeling that a person naturally gets when he sees something grotesque.  When a person sees the victim of a brutal, bloody murder which leaves organs and guts everywhere, he has the tendency to show you what he had for lunch.  This "knot in your stomach" is the exact same thing on a smaller scale. 2. It is the result of the compassion you feel for someone who has suffered.  Physically, emotions are just another one of the chemical movements in your brain, and EVERYTHING in your body is connected to your brain.  This includes involuntary muscle movements, such as those that take place in your stomach.  Emotions, taking place in the brain, can affect any part of the body.  This is why depressed people also hurt physically.|`|BaINDEKcaa	We are raised to believe that things like clairvoyance & the ability to cure our own illness are not possible.<br>  <br>  We become too dependent on looking outside of ourselves for things that our weakened instincts should already know. <br>  <br>  That feeling of lethargy on a rainy day, the knot you get in your stomach when you see someone else with an injury, the feeling of peace when you're in the woods -- these are part of the mind/body being a part of the world around it.<br>  <br>  People are animals. We were all born with the same abilities as animals. To instinctively know when someone is up to no good, to know when someone is in trouble. Our intellect is a blessing and a curse at the same time.

wwnw9mCUaa	POWER HOUSE OF CELL|`|8570ccb497e3dbcebec056c26ed6ddddaa	Mitochondria is a cell organelle found in all the cells.  Respiration process takes place in this organelle.|`|r2jECPqsaa	In cell biology, a mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in most eukaryotic cells.[1] These organelles range from 0.5–10 micrometers (μm) in diameter. Mitochondria are sometimes described as "cellular power plants" because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy. [2] In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in a range of other processes, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, cell death, as well as the control of the cell cycle and cell growth.[3] Mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases, including mitochondrial disorders[4] and cardiac dysfunction,[5] and may play a role in the aging process. The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek μ?το? or mitos, thread + χονδρ?ον or khondrion, granule. Several characteristics make mitochondria unique. The number of mitochondria in a cell varies widely by organism and tissue type. Many cells have only a single mitochondrion, whereas others can contain several thousand mitochondria.[6][7] The organelle is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, the intermembrane space, the inner membrane, and the cristae and matrix. Mitochondrial proteins vary depending on the tissues and species. In human, 615 distinct types of proteins were identified from cardiac mitochondria;[8] whereas in murinae (rats), 940 proteins encoded by distinct genes were reported.[9] The mitochondrial proteome is thought to be dynamically regulated.[10] Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own independent genome. Further, its DNA shows substantial similarity to bacterial genomes.|`|0U6fSHGOaa	Mitochondria are small complex structures which exist in every cell of the body (except red blood cells). The Mitochondrion has been called the 'powerhouse' of the cell because these tiny structures produce most of the energy which we need to grow and live. One unique feature of mitochondria is that they have there own DNA molecules, Mitochondrial DNA or (mtDNA), which carries the genes containing the genetic messages for critical energy metabolism processes.<br>  Defects of mitochondria metabolism results in wide variety of human disorders which can present at any time from fetal and early infancy to late adulthood and involve virtually any tissue either alone or in combination.<br>  Mitochondrial diseases are very variable in their features so called clinical heterogeneity. Mitochondrial diseases are whole body diseases but the exact features of the disease vary from patient to another. Some patients will have predominately brain disease or central nervous system disease (Mitochondrial cytopathy). Others will have muscle disease (Mitochondrial myopathy), cardiac disease (cardiomyopathies), endocrine, renal or bone marrow disease or a mixture of these and or other features.<br>  Many Mitochondrial diseases result in the accumulation of organic acids in the body. These are usually normal metabolic intermediates but when present in excess, the acidosis itself may become damaging and life-threatening. Lactic acid or (Lactic Acidosis) is one such accumulation and is a common problem in Mitochondrial diseases.|`|nYSgIKW9aa	it's an organelle found in eukaryotic cells<br>  basically, it's where energy is produced<br>  <br>  it's the site where ATP is broken down into ADP. when ATP is broken down into ADP, energy is released|`|iC6ia44xaa	it is found inside the cell.  it is where the power/energy is released, hence it is called as power house.|`|sB38LHKRaa	it is responsible for producing power in the living cells|`|Jpy1zBblaa	It is a cell organnell.It is the power house of a cell.Mitochondria are the cells' power sources.

lkNJNnlSaa	At the start of Respiration a Glucose (6C) is converted into Pyruvate (3C) in a process called Glycolysis.<br>  <br>  CO2 is removed from the Pyruvate to form Ethanal (2C).<br>  <br>  It's advanatageous to Human Skeletal Muscle because the supply of Pyruvate from Glycolysis is more than the oxygen supply available for the later stages of aerobic respiration. This is called ''oxygen debt'' and is when the cells start to respire anaerobically by lactate fermentation.|`|qXAZZOViaa	as we start exercising the muscle start utilizing glucose to produce energy.glucose is initially metabolized to pyruvate by the glycolytic pathway which help in producing ATP & NADH.<br>  glucose + NAD +ADP → pyruvate + NADH +ATP<br>                    <br>  pyruvate further is metabolized to CO2 & water via the krebs cycle producing ATP &NADH.muscle utilize ATP molecule as the direct source of energy but NADH molecules has to be further converted to ATP.<br>  pyruvate + NAD +ADP → co2 + NADH +ATP<br>  NADH are converted to ATP via electron transport chain where NADH is converted to NAD + 2H +2e-.the hydrogen ion and two electron passes through a series of reaction that yield ATP and these two hydrogen molecule along with two electrones are transferred finally to oxygen giving rise to water<br>             2NADH →2NAD + 4H+  4e  <br>                  O2    +     4H    +  4e-   → 2 H2O(water)<br>  <br>  the NAD so produced returns back to glyocolytic pathway and is again converted to NADH.<br>  when exercising heavily the oxygen demand of muscle is much more than supplied by our bloodleading to a decrease rate of NADH utilization as electron transport chain is hampered.hence the NADH molecules start accumulating in our muscle due to lack of electron transport chain that convert NADH to NAD.if all of the NAD is converted  to NADH then glycolytic pathway will stop as it requires the presence of NAD.<br>  so in absence of oxygen our muscle convert NADH to NAD by reacting it with pyruvate.in this process pyruvate is converted to lactate and NADH to NAD.<br>  so anaerobic respiration is helpful to muscle only when the oxygen supply is less compared to demand of the muscle as it allow the glyoctic pathway to go on that can provide muscle with some ammount of energy<br>  lactic acid is responsible for pain producing pain during exercise.while we rest after exercise the lactic acid is converted back to pyruvic acid and then redirected for producing energy via krebs cycle and electrone transport chain

AA11004225	The cause of carbon monoxide production is incomplete combustion of carbon-bearing matter. This is caused by insufficient oxygen being supplied, usually because of poor ventilation in the case of a fire (of any type).<br>  <br>  Since gas & coke contain high proportions of carbon, it is vitally necessary to supply plenty of oxygen to the fire in order ot prevent carbon monoxide being formed. If the coke fire is choked, or if the fire isn't properly ventilated, there will indeed be carbon monoxide issuing forth. Assuming it's still burning, of course!<br>  <br>  Check the colour of the flames. The flames should be bright yellow, edged with blue. The yellow shows the presence of carboniferous particles, the blue indicates any carbon monoxide burning to produce the far less dangerous dioxide.<br>  <br>  Even better would be to buy & maintain a carbon monoxide detector, just to be sure.|`|1d7a1b7ab25d6e3edafff6c897a00d32aa	Indeed it can, coke is just elemental carbon and if there is not enough oxygen it will form CO.<br>  <br>  2C + O2 ---> 2CO<br>  <br>  If you're using it in an open space you should have no problem
z7BiMSWmaa	Divergent evolution occurs when a group from a specific population develops into a new species. In order to adapt to various environmental conditions, the two groups develop into distinct species due to differences in the demands driven by the environmental circumstances. A good example of how divergent evolution occurs is in comparing how a human foot evolved to be very different from a monkey's foot, despite their common primate ancestry. It is speculated that a new species (humans) developed because there was no longer was a need for swinging from trees. Upright walking on the ground required alterations in the foot for better speed and balance. These differing traits soon became characteristics that evolved to permit movement on the ground. Although humans and monkeys are genetically similar, their natural habitat required different physical traits to evolve for survival.

0U6fSHGOaa	A bacterium is a unicellular microorganism which represents one of the most basic and primitive forms of life. Bacteria are everywhere, from pools of nuclear waste to deep inside the Earth's crust, and it is believed that bacteria were the first living organisms on Earth. You come into contact with bacteria constantly, although you may not be aware of it. Bacteria exist in such abundance that scientists have barely begun to scratch the surface of the bacterial life on Earth, although some species are well known to humans because they cause infections or disease.<br>  <br>  Several things are common to all bacteria, regardless as to how they live their lives. The organisms are classified in the kingdom Prokaryota, which used to be known as Monera. There are only two domains in this kingdom: bacteria and archaea. Bacteria lack a cell nucleus, and they also do not have organelles, like most other celled organisms do. Organelles are small structures inside a cell which have specific functions, like mitochondria. A bacterium has a single DNA molecule, along with RNA strands to help it replicate.<br>  <br>  The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology. The more the organisms are studied, the more surprises they yield. A bacterium can come in a range of shapes, although most break down into rod, spiral, or curved shapes. The organisms typically use small hairs attached to their cell walls known as flagella to move around, and a bacterium may have one flagella or a plethora. In most cases, bacteria are surrounded by a hard outer shell which helps to protect them from the elements. This shell allows a bacterium to put itself into stasis, waiting for more congenial conditions to emerge.<br>  <br>  A bacterium can live in a number of different ways. Some species are free living, meaning that they exist independently in things like soil, air, and water. Others may form relationships with additional bacteria or other organisms, taking advantage of mutual strengths to survive. In some cases, bacteria may colonize an animal, although they are perfectly capable of living without their host; bacteria use the host as a source of food, not necessarily for shelter. In most cases, bacteria actually assist their hosts, helping them to digest and break down food, and consuming cast off skin and hair. In other instances, as with pathogenic bacteria, the colonization results in an illness such as plague, tuberculosis, or cholera.<br>  <br>  Many people are familiar with the rapid multiplication of bacteria, which can be accomplished in a number of ways. Most commonly, a bacterium grows and splits itself, thus creating exponential growth within a colony as each new generation grows and splits, sometimes within minutes. Bacteria can also exchange genetic information, including mutations, with each other. Some bacteria can also reproduce through budding, growing a portion of a parent cell which breaks off and grows into a new bacterium.|`|BgLuDvJSaa	gram negative are those bacteria which have a special covering or capsule around them made of lipids.they are more virulent and harmful.and they don't get killed easily as compared to those who don't have capsule.i.e.gram positive.<br>  hope it helps.

CCeRdaoLaa	Guided evolution is pretty much the same thing as theistic evolution.  It's the idea that evolution occurred as the science supports.  Rather than a natural, undirected process, though, it was the way that God created life.  In other words, acknowledges God as the creator of life, but claims that He did it through evolution rather than literally as described in Genesis.<br>  <br>  I suppose the term could also apply to selective breeding in animals.  Cows, for example, have been bred by humans for thousands of years in order to produce the most milk or meat, or be able to haul heavier loads.  By breeding animals, humans guide their evolution by selecting traits most beneficial to human purposes (rather than the cows' survival in the wild).

But looking at the ring structure pretty all you do is looking C4 you move away from it in both directions(left and right) until you reach different a molecule present on one side and not the other. So on both sides you'd have, CH2, then CH2, you finally reach the OH group on C1 from both sides. So you just add the OH with either the left or right side and group them as molecules leaving you with {CH2 + CH2 = C2H4}  and {CH2 + CH2 + COH = C3H5OH}.|`|AA11524578	The other two groups are the carbons numbered 3 and 5 in the ring.<br>  <br>  In this case, the only stereochemistry you're dealing with is cis or trans, as to how the OH and CH3 groups relate to each other.  If one is axial and the other equatorial, it's cis, or Z.  If both are axial or both equatorial (the most likely positions), then it's trans, or E.

7uFaB8QQaa	The earth's magnetic field is pretty weak - about 0.5 Gauss or 5 x 10^-5 Tesla on average.  Now the force the field can exert on a current is given by:<br>  <br>   F = iLxB  where i = current L is a vector representing the length of the wire carrying the current and the direction the current is flowing in, B is the magentic field vector, and the "x" is the vector corss product.  <br>  <br>  I put this detail in because you have to generate a force the is opposite that of gravity to leave teh ground and a force to propel you in teh direction you desire.  We'll get back to that.<br>  <br>  Suppose your craft weighs 9.8 N ( 1kg mass).  Then just of have neutral forces acting on it you'd require<br>  <br>  F = mg = i|L| |B| sin(q)  where the " | |" is teh magnitude of a vector and the q = angle between L and B.  Lets pretend that we can set q = 90 deg then <br>  <br>  i|L| = mg/|B|~ 2x10^5 amp-m<br>  <br>  So if you could have 100 m of wire, you'd need 2000 Amps of current just to neutralize gravity assuming you could line up L and B and the force of gravity so that q = 90 deg. 2000 A is a lot of current and you won't easily generate that in a 1kg mass.  Further, generally the erath's B field is not parallel to the ground so q will have to be adjusted to direct the force due tot he magnetic field in teh vertical direction, this means that sin(q) < 1 so either i or L (or both) must increase from the values above.<br>  <br>  All this makes for a heavier craft which means you need more current, etc.  Net result is that is unlikely that you can use the magnetic field of the earth to drive an aircraft.

Of course, the air has a *mass*, but this mass got nothing to do with the pressure.<br>  <br>  If you have an orbiting space station with a volume comparable to a 747 jumbo jet, the air in it, at our good old Earthly pressure of 1 bar, will have a *mass* of about a ton, even though it *weighs* nothing.<br>  <br>  What has the science teaching come down to these days... :(|`|KGOHLaUQaa	The altitude above sea level.<br>  <br>  The closer you are to the center of the Earth, the more pressure you feel.<br>  The farther, the less.|`|7bdf5a098d7a02ff130de99bfcdab400aa	the weight of the atmosphere above a particular location|`|fvfv0FNuaa	B: the weight of the atmosphere above a particular location.

Firstly, I think you mean x + y^2 = 3 and probably y is intended to be the dependent variable and x the independent variable.<br>  <br>  For this to be a function, each value of x should only result in one corresponding value of y. So if x = -1 in this case, you get y^2 = 4, which could lead to either y = 2 or -2. So this fails to be a function.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you made x the dependent variable and y the independent one, things change in that for any one value of y you choose, there will only be one corresponding value of x. So that would be a function.

I suggest you first count up the number the # of elements you have of each, ie. 6 carbons 4 oxygens in the reactants etc.<br>  <br>  Then you look at your products and again count the number of elements you have in the products. ie. 12 carbons, 8 oxygens etc.<br>  <br>  then choose an element i.e. carbon and look at your equation in the reactants and products side. Try to think of a whole number that makes an equal number of carbons in the reactants and products. so in my example the reactants had 6 C and products 12 C. Well to make the reactants have 12 C (you want the same number of carbon on both sides), you can multiply it by 2. So put the coefficient 2 on the reactant side.<br>  <br>  Then you have to consider the other elements in your equation after you added the coefficient 2. recount the number of each element in the reactant and products. Then add another coefficient either in the reactant/products so that ultimately the product and reactants have the same number of elements on each side. <br>  <br>  sorry if this is too wordy.

Scientists did a study where they released pure carbon dioxide into the top 1/3 of the globe (where the large evergreen forests are) and studied how it effected the life in that area.  It actually helped a lot.  By the end the average concentration of CO2 while they emitted it from the truck was 10 times that of what we have in our atmosphere.  The real culprit is Carbon Monoxide (you get this in any material that creates CO2 when burned.)  Carbon dioxide is easier to measure then Carbon Monoxide and hence has been blamed but really it takes LESS carbon Monoxide to create a catastrophic change in our atmosphere.  The reasoning for this is that CO2 sinks while CO floats.  therefore Carbon Monoxide is a great Greenhouse gas, CO2 is not.|`|0U6fSHGOaa	Carbon dioxide is one the main pollutants that causes air pollution. This is because, although living beings do exhale carbon dioxide, this gas is harmful when emitted from other sources, which are caused due to human activity. An additional release of carbon dioxide happens due to various such activities. Carbon dioxide gas is used in various industries such as the oil industry and the chemical industry. The manufacturing process of most products would require the use of this gas. There are various human activities that add to the increased proportions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels and the harmful effects of deforestation have all contributed towards the same. show that amongst the various gasses emitted during a volcanic eruption, carbon dioxide remains to be at least 40% of the emission. Scientists have now therefore identified carbon dioxide as one of those elements that have contributed to global warming. <br>  <br>  Causes of air pollution are not limited to this. The combustion of fuels in automobiles, jet planes etc all cause the release of several primary pollutants into the air. The burning of fossil fuels in big cities which is seen at most factories, offices and even a large number of homes, it is no wonder that air pollution is increasing at an alarming rate. The release of other harmful gases all adds to the state that we see today. Although carbon dioxide plays an important role in various other processes like photosynthesis, breathing an excess of the same also causes harmful effects towards one’s health. <br>  <br>  The various causes of air pollution that releases harmful gases into the atmosphere are caused due to the increasing number of power plants and manufacturing units or industries that mostly have activities related to the burning of fuels. Besides, as mentioned earlier, most automobiles, marine vessels, activities that involve the burning of wood, fumes that are released from aerosol sprays, military activities that involve the use of nuclear weapons, all are the numerous causes of air pollution. <br>  <br>  Carbon monoxide is another such gas which, although was present in the atmosphere earlier, is now considered to be a major pollutant. An excess of the same has a harmful effect on our system. There are many reasons why carbon monoxide can be released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. This is also produced due to any fuel burning appliance and appliances such as gas water heaters, fireplaces, woodstoves, gas stoves, gas dryers, yard equipments as well as automobiles, which add to the increased proportion of this gas into the atmosphere. <br>  <br>  Sulfur dioxide is yet another harmful pollutant that causes air pollution. Sulfur dioxide is emitted largely to the excessive burning of fossil fuels, petroleum refineries, chemical and coal burning power plants etc. Nitrogen dioxide when combined with sulfur dioxide can even cause a harmful reaction in the atmosphere that can cause acid rain. <br>  <br>  Nitrogen dioxide is one more gas that is emitted into the atmosphere as a result of various human activities. An excess of nitrogen dioxide mainly happens due to most power plants seen in major cities, the burning of fuels due to various motor vehicles and other such sources, whether industrial or commercial that cause the increase in the levels of nitrogen dioxide. <br>  <br>  These and a number of other hazardous air pollutants are emitted with the various numbers of activities that we carry out during the day which are the main causes of air pollution.|`|zP15XX27aa	gas, oil, littering,etc.

3f8657f0038df4efc84a4da144ab2f59aa	There are currently 3 large scale methods of producing permanent electricity- fossil fuels, nuclear and dams.<br>  <br>  Green energies like wind, geothermal, hydrogen, and solar are all either so far from production they become impractical, or only beneficial in smaller applications. Solar is among the most expensive power supplies. Hydrogen on a large scale would likely be produced by (what else?!)- nuclear reactors. <br>  <br>  None of these "green energies" is anywhere near being able to practically impact the nation's power grid for decades, if ever.<br>  <br>  Dams are a great supply of energy, if you live near fjords. Massive large scale projects are involved in producing them, although some natural dams will continue to power regions of the world lucky enough to have them nearby.<br>  <br>  Fossil fuels like coal create tons and tons of waste, and while slow efforts are made to reduce the emissions, all fossil fuel plants pollute. A lot. <br>  <br>  Nuclear power plants are almost entirely emission free and non-polluting. Most of these methods are fairly cheap (natural gas being the most expensive, and after a dam is built, it becomes the cheapest over time. Nuclear becomes cheaper than coal after about a decade or so operational).<br>  <br>  Drawbacks are storage of spent fuel, although France recycles their fuel and we have never considered doing this since former President Jimmy Carter (a former nuke officer in the Navy!) declared recycling off-limits. He did this because we were still involved in the Cold War, and nuclear non-proliferation was a very big cause in the late 70's.<br>  <br>  The spent fuel takes up very little space but is dangerously radioactive. Spent fuel is either kept safely in the bottom of large pools at operating plants, and as these pools fill up, are being stored in cement casks on site at these plants. Yucca mountain's inception will likely be pushed back so far (supposed to be open a decade ago, the earliest date now is 2017 last I heard) that we will likely adopt a recycling method similar to France.<br>  <br>  Prior to the scare at Three-Mile Island in 1979, nuclear plants were already being scrapped as the nation's energy grid was becoming saturated with both coal and nuclear power plants. <br>  <br>  Three Mile Island helped push the nuclear option off the table in the 80's as public resentment was high and investing in new power plants was at a low. <br>  <br>  The nuclear meltdown itself was entirely contained, and no incident of dose uptake was ever discovered afterwards. (Radiation screening centers were opened up in the surrounding towns for any residents concerned in the following weeks. No resident registered even the faintest uptake of radiation).<br>  <br>  But the scare was immense, and it would be a long time before we started building nuclear plants again. The nuclear industry created INPO, a collective of personnel from all plants. INPO monitors behaviors and activities and constantly drive the industry towards improvement. They generate "report-card" grades to plants who are exhibiting good behaviours and remaining error free, and the NRC can use these grades to determine if a plant should shut down. <br>  <br>  The creation of INPO was an invention of necessity in the nuclear industry following TMI, but it has paid off since and has driven us a long way from the operations mentalities that paved the way for accidents like TMI.<br>  <br>  Lately, surgeons and pilots are beginning to use many of the nuclear industries developed practices, such as "pre-job briefs". It seems those industries are tired of making mistakes as well.<br>  <br>  What do you know.

The Three Mile Island incident was very minor and the system worked as designed; the safety systems in nuclear plants make accidents virtually impossible.  Panic since I said they could but nothing is 100% ever-wind turbines could fall over and hurt people.  The largest user of nuclear power plants is Japan and the US has more then one operating facility and many others exist in Europe and the rest of the world.

The problem is not that nuclear power is not safe but that knee jerk reactions to the word nuclear combined with sensationalism has made people think they are.  Yes I live close to one and no it doesn't bother me.

Sure there are inherent dangers with nuclear power, but so long as we enforce standards the issues virtually disappear. <br>  however, in order to pursue nuclear power we first need better methods of recycling the fuel rods and we secondly need a storage facility to dump the irradiated material.

GoFEvz2laa	Only a very small percentage of people who have been submerged underwater for a long time can be resuscitated.  Of those who were, because they were in very cold water, it is because the body's core temperature was reduced sufficiently so their metabolism was slowed, but not halted.  Their systems still functioned, albeit at a very slow rate.  Most importantly, their brains were not fully deprived of oxygen so "brain death" did not occur. <br>  <br>  _The Mamalian Diving Reflex_<br>  When a person’s face comes into sudden contact with very cold water, the “mammalian diving reflex” may be triggered. This lowers the heart rate, increases blood pressure, shuts down blood circulation to all but the body’s core. The result is a lowered metabolism, so the body can conserve oxygen. This may help survival in cold water, since oxygen in the blood is carried to the brain and vital organs where it is needed most. As a result of the dive reflex, people submerged for more than four minutes (when brain damage usually occurs) have been successfully resuscitated. (U. Minn.)

25bb68e5838bec7dd4b52b311a37d70caa	Evolution is there but that's not the ultimate answer how the world was created. Think this way, if I was told by a teacher that some object is pencil (in reality this object is pen) I would believe it. From then on, I would just think that object is pen. In big bang theory, I see much similarities with my example. Keeping this is in mind you can give totally new perspective to the understanding of how world was created. Now people who believe in big bang theory should think differently, from own perspective and not just think that scientists are right because of what you have learned in past through you education. I agree with certain facts but I still think if the concepts were derived differently I would have different opinion about these fact due to my knowledge. Now we know that scientists nor can I tell how the explosion occur for big bang theory to start. Keep in mind that big bang theory is just the perspective that scientists use. I am a scientist, but whatever I learned is no where close to enough for me to believe that these theories are right.  But once again that's why they are called theories. Maybe I am not too much involved in big bang theory, but think this way, assuming that there was an explosion, elements created, but were all elements created that are listed on periodic table? Lets say that water was there, was Lithium created from water? Maybe something like that happened, but I am pretty sure that this process would have required external usages which then we would question where did those external things come from? Now asking this nonsense questions, I come with Big Bang Theory 2, Lithium was created from Water by somekind of collisions between Oxygen and Hydrogen and mixing into each other. This might be true but we learned that atoms are never destroyed, then how can they create compound without coming out of that "hydrogen and oxygen" mode? I am sure you are getting bored of my stuff haha...thats what I feel about big bang theory, this is a pure perspective, and if you want to really bore yourself, ask me where did the perspective come from? and i could answer about signal and receptions and all kind of activities in the body, but then you could ask me how did this process start? Maybe because I moved and something in side moved and caused the process? I am bored man I am really getting into nonsense, and I know i sound stupid. Arlight I'll let you go at this point but honestly, its just your perspective, believe it but there is always an alternative to the answer and thus I believe in God, because he seems to answer all my questions....if you like my answer please select me as you problem solver haha|`|lQao8Wt0aa	This is why, as a physicist, I don't see a conflict between science and religion.  Every new discovery reveals questions that can't be explained by logic - the laws of physics came from somewhere, and if every atom in the universe was created in that first second......from where did the energy come ?|`|pd4VLvoHaa	I am answering your question indirectly by responding directly to 'samthesuperfurryanimal' (the message above mine I think). If every 'origin' ultimately forces us to subsequently ask, "Okay... then what caused that?" at some point, shouldn't that accumulatively convince us that there is no such thing as a universal absolute origin?<br>  <br>  I think in big bang vernacular, we are way too hung up on 'beginning' & 'ending' context, and (this is just an intuition, not a 'theory') I suspect in a universal context, ideas such as 'beginning' and 'ending' are utterly irrelevent and ignorant provincial superstitions.<br>  <br>  Okay, so I guess maybe that does sort of answer the initial question. My answer is SOMETHING. Something caused the necessary element and impetus to initiate the big bang. We can't know what that is because the big bang erased all the evidence (it's like a perfect crime) but it certainly wasn't 'nothing', so by process of elimination, that means the correct answer is 'something'.|`|AA10364399	There is no answer to this in the big bang theory.<br>  <br>  In big bang theory, the entirity of space is curved, so time began at the same time that the universe began. There was no 'before'. It's a bit like saying what is North of the North Pole.<br>  <br>  Some scientists say that this means there is a God, who created everything necessary for the Big Bang to occur - otherwise, where did the universe come from?<br>  Personally, I don't agree with this view. Because you would still have to explain where God came from, so you still have the same problem! And it's no better to say that "God just is" - because you might as well say "the Universe just is".<br>  <br>  Still, it's a bit of a puzzler. Where did evrything come from? No-one knows :0)|`|FZLiRKIjaa	the great housekeeper with her cosmic swiffer|`|gLp7pvPnaa	Who came before the who in your question?|`|b8tgCAQJaa	There is no "who" in big bang theory.
AA10364399	Well, it's a bit like throwing a ball in the air. At any speed we could throw a ball, it would go up for a while and then fall back down again. But if we fired a ball out of a really big cannon, it might get right out of reach of the earth's gravity.<br>  <br>  With the universe, all the matter came flying apart at the big bang. If it had fired out even a tiny bit slower it would have fallen together by now. As it is, it looks like it has almost exactly the right amount of speed to fly apart and never come back together again.<br>  <br>  To be more precise, you should think in terms of energy. You can calculate how much potential energy an object loses when coming closer to the earth. But even if you came from infinitely far away, this energy wouldn't be infinite. That means if you fire a ball up with more energy than this, the earth's gravity can never reclaim it.<br>  <br>  Similarly, if the kinetic (movement) energy in the universe is big enough now, the gravitational attraction might never be big enough to pull everything back together.<br>  <br>  To make things more complicated, scientists currently think the gravity might push things apart rather than pull things together, at extremely large distances. But we don't really know for sure yet!|`|e0227973f38e13ea78ebdb8fcda760efaa	Two reasons. Firstly it's still expanding due to the initial moment caused by the big bang, but it is also expanding due to the pressure of dark energy (whatever that is - and we really don't know yet)|`|1d7ba071150759756c6284bca18876c3aa	Momentum. The universe started out with a Big Bang of unknown origin, expanding in all directions in an unbounded way. And, as Sr Isaac said, "An object once in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force". The return force is collective gravitational attraction, but it is not sufficient to stop the expansion. It should slow it down, though, but it doesn't because there is also a mysterious repulsive force called "dark energy" causing the expansion to accelerate. No one knows what that's all about.<br>  <br>  I see we have our "God done it" answer.  I'm still waiting for "It is 'cause it is" or the like.

I can't recall ever bringing food with me when observing at a remote location.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	Good Questions!<br>  Really whatever makes you comfortable while observing.<br>  <br>  I don't typically bring anything to eat because I like to keep food matter away from my equipment.  But I know plenty of astronomer who do bring food and they don't have any problem.  It really up to you. You might also consider fruit like apples and banana's for energy. <br>  <br>  Hears what suggest:<br>  1) Plan your observing session.  <br>  Write up a list of objects that you want to view and their best viewing times in the evening. So that you can find an object, observe it, record your observation (in a log), and then move to the next object.<br>  <br>  2) Take a flashlight that emits a red beam of light.<br>  You need a light that wont distort your night vision.  A white light flashlight will give you temporary night blindness.  The red light flashlight will not affect your night vision.<br>  <br>  3) Wear warm clothes<br>  Make sure your are prepared for cold temps even in the summer.  A coverall garment that is rated around -30F will be comfortable even in a mild climate.  Also, make sure your feet, hands, and head stay warm.<br>  <br>  4) Take plenty of liquids<br>  I take a thermos of hot tea with me during the winter months and plenty of bottle water during the summer months.  This actually keeps your energy level up better than consuming a lot of food. It's really better to eat before you go out.<br>  <br>  5) Take a roll of biodegradable toilet paper.<br>  Generally, there are no public facilities at an observing field. So you want to be prepared. This is another reason why you shouldn't be bulking up on food at an observing site.<br>  <br>  6) Double check your equipment before you start off.<br>  There is nothing more frustrating than to drive 20 - 60 minutes to an observing site than to find you'd left an key piece of equipment like a power inverter, computer, or observing log behind. Make sure you understand how your scope is put together and operates before you go out observing.  It's almost impossible to put a brand new scope together in the dark. Practice putting your equipment together in a dark room with a red light flashlight so you'll know how to put it together in the dark or with limited light. <br>  <br>  7) Clean up your trash before you leave.  The observing site should be left as clean as you found it.<br>  <br>  8) Music is fine.  I personally like listening to the night.  It has a profoundly calming affect on me.<br>  <br>  9) Go observing with your local astronomy club or with friends.  It's alot more fun than going alone.  Also, plan on attending a local "Star Party".  They are a blast.<br>  <br>  10) Plan to enjoy your observing time.  <br>  If after all you done, the equipment fails and you forget the food and drink and you forget the red flashlight.  Remember you still have to two eyes in your head and stars up above.  So enjoy the Universe around you.<br>  <br>  Happy Stargazing!

Because of that the amount of energy that is released the the steam should equal the amount of kinetic energy contained within the liquid water. Once the pressure on the liquid water is released that, it would instantly evaporate into steam with an equal amount of energy.<br>  <br>  Ed

AA10364399	1. You can get a 'bottle rocket' kit - these come with stabilizers and a hose, but more importantly they have a good valve. The valve means you can pump a lot of air into the bottle before the valve releases and the rocket shoots off.<br>  <br>  2. Use the right proportions of air and water. <br>  You need the air because when it's compressed, this stores the energy needed to drive your rocket. You need the water because it's the heavy water coming out the back that gives the rocket momentum to go forward. So too much water, and you can't get enough energy in the compressed air; and too much air and the water runs out too soon (air is too light to provide useful momentum when it squirts out).<br>  I think about 1/3 water works best.|`|pRF5LLloaa	A water rocket has a poor thrust-to-weight ratio.<br>  <br>  Remember, the TOTAL weight of the rocket includes the weight of the water (fuel).

G6t2O9Kmaa	NLP pretends to be a science, but is really pseudoscience, for its claims are not based on the scientific method. Its very name is a pretence to a legitimate discipline like neuroscience, neurolinguistics, and psychology. It has a large collection of scientific sounding terms, like eye accessing cues, metamodeling, micromodeling, metaprogramming, neurological levels, presuppositions, primary representational systems, modalities and submodalities. Corballis (1999) argues that "NLP is a thoroughly fake title, designed to give the impression of scientific respectability". According to Beyerstein (1995) "though it claims neuroscience in its pedigree, NLP's outmoded view of the relationship between cognitive style and brain function ultimately boils down to crude analogies.

qJ52Y9Auaa	Naproxen is an NSAID that can exacerbate kidney disease if a patient already has it. NSAIDS inhibit COX enzymes, which is responsible for producing prostaglandin. Prostaglandin E and I causes afferent arteriole vasodilation, thus if inhibited, you will not get afferent arteriole vasodilation (dilation of the blood vessels so that more blood can flow to the kidneys; if your blood vessels don't dilate, they will be narrow, thus causing less blood to flow to the kidneys), which will decrease the amount of blood flow to your kidneys, which will worsen the function of your kidneys. <br>  <br>  Most patients don't take NSAIDS chronically or long term, so if you have healthy kidneys, they probably won't directly cause kidney disease.

AA11737190	There are various formulations of stainless steel. The main element in stainless steel is, of course, iron. It is the chromium that makes the steel stainless. Various other elements may be present in differing amounts.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Steel is an alloy consisting mostly of iron, with a carbon content between 0.2% and 2.14% by weight (C:110–10Fe), depending on grade. Carbon is the most cost-effective alloying material for iron, but various other alloying elements are used such as manganese, chromium, vanadium, and tungsten. Carbon and other elements act as a hardening agent, preventing dislocations in the iron atom crystal lattice from sliding past one another. Varying the amount of alloying elements and form of their presence in the steel (solute elements, precipitated phase) controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting steel. Steel with increased carbon content can be made harder and stronger than iron, but is also more brittle. The maximum solubility of carbon in iron (as austenite) is 2.14% by weight, occurring at 1149 °C; higher concentrations of carbon or lower temperatures will produce cementite. Alloys with higher carbon content than this are known as cast iron because of their lower melting point and castability.Steel is also to be distinguished from wrought iron containing only a very small amount of other elements, but containing 1–3% by weight of slag in the form of particles elongated in one direction, giving the iron a characteristic grain. It is more rust-resistant than steel and welds more easily. It is common today to talk about 'the iron and steel industry' as if it were a single entity, but historically they were separate products.<br>  <br>  Though steel had been produced by various inefficient methods long before the Renaissance, its use became more common after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century. With the invention of the Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, steel became a relatively inexpensive mass-produced good. Further refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking, further lowered the cost of production while increasing the quality of the metal. Today, steel is one of the most common materials in the world and is a major component in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, and appliances.

This is in my opinion the hard stuff.<br>  <br>  The chemical engineering subjects are very interesting on the other hand, my favourite one is the study of unit operations, in which you will study the many different processes we see in industries, like distillation or crushing of ores.

But you will find them fun to study, and there are lots of tools that can help you in the process, graphic calculators, MathCad or MS Excel. During the course you will also have many opportunities to learn other non chemical engineering subjects that will help you a lot in your carreer.<br>  <br>  I say you won't regret choosing this degree, you can work with many different things afterwards, I think you should go for it!<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|v2dzHs2Maa	You can take some course lectures online for free.

ATGXKT08aa	Right out of your hand. The farther it goes the more it slows down.|`|7JzqsICcaa	Right out of your hand.|`|buLqy1b3aa	Short answer:  when the ball reaches terminal velocity.  I definitely can't say exactly where this will happen.  I think only an expert in pitching could give you a good estimate.<br>  <br>  I can give you the concept though:<br>  <br>  To make the ball go as fast as possible, you throw it as hard as possible at as high a point as possible.  Therefore there are two things that make the ball accelerate: your hand, and gravity.<br>  <br>  If that was all there was to it, however, then the ball would just keep accelerating, and keep getting faster.  From experience I think we know this doesn't happen.<br>  <br>  What slows the ball down is air resistance.  The point where the ball is going so fast that air resistance cancels out gravity is called terminal velocity.  I guess someone who knows more about when a baseball reaches terminal velocity will be able to give a more specific answer.|`|KGOHLaUQaa	The pitch does not go faster after leaving the applied force because the force is what adds the acceleration, but only while in contact. Once it leaves your hand, it's no longer being accelerated. It's being decelerated by air resistance. If you added auxiliary thrusters to the baseball it will speed up.<br>  <br>  However, we're speaking purely horizontal. If you threw the ball in an Arch, if the batter is lower than you vertically, and air resistance is not enough to affect the speed of the ball, the ball will be going faster.<br>  <br>  The ball is affected by air resistance longer in this case, so it is highly unlikely that it will be faster at that point in space, so it's best to throw as horizontal as possible.

It should also be noted, however, that the intensity or loudness of sound is measured in decibels.  For instance, a typical office room has a twa (time weighted average) of 65 - 70 db.  In factory and other settings, anything over 85 db requires the use of ear plugs according to the Osha standard.  Sound is created by the vibration of atoms rubbing against each other.  Sound also travels faster in water than it does in air because the molecules are closer together.<br>  <br>  Ed|`|ebf432dfa3eafe39fd649d3c326e9929aa	Acoustics is the science of sound waves or maybe you are looking for the word audio, auditory or audiology.|`|bvZzPcK4aa	acoustics

4283c6ea8e856476bcccc6289e6452adaa	Normally I would say water, but I've been told that plants will actually grow faster with Coke or Pepsi.  It's never been proven as far as I know, though.  If it does work better, notice I said if, then it's potentially due to the extra carbon in the carbonized water that pop/soda contains.<br>  I'm sorry to say this, but milk isn't going to do much to help plants to grow with.  Someone mentioned calcium would help them grow.  That's actually a misconception.  Although plants might need a minute amount of calcium, overall, it's not a mineral that a plant can utilize.  Calcium if primarily used in humans and animals in order to hard, strengthen and rebuild our bones and teeth.  Since plants don't have those components, it wouldn't be much help to them.<br>  I thought of a way to test the pop/soda vs. water theory, though. You could have ten plants of the same species all planted at the same time.  Each day, a certain amount of water would be given to five of the ten.  These would be your constants.  The other five would be given the same amount of soda pop.  The end results after a long stretch of time could then be graphed.  The constants to keep in mind is the amount of sunlight and air quality for all ten plants.  Supposidly, the carbon dioxide that is expelled by talking to plants can also make them grow faster as well.<br>  <br>  Ed|`|SMNPqBIOaa	I think water, because all of the other ones sound like they're going to make the plant die :P Lol.

0925cd0b1673d42030a75763d5c46af6aa	This is because the fact that water can absorb a lot of heat. Hence why in Sept. that you get a lot of hurricanes because of the light in June and July. Also the reason why there are more typhoons then hurricanes is because hurricanes have to deal with more land in the Atlantic then the Typhoons have to. Think of it this way the Islands in the Atlantic act like a speed bump if you think of hurricanes and Typhoons as cars. The speed bump will keep you slowing down so you can't build up  the power of your car to well but with the Typhoon there is nothing out there except some minor Island chains that wont affect it to much. The Typhoon would be able to gather more force behind it because there is nothing like the speed bump to keep it in check if you will.  The longer storm season is because the Typhoons just happen to come at the wet Monsoon season and that's when its really humid and the Typhoons can pull some of that moisture from India to help sustain itself for a little while|`|AA6Aq94vaa	This is because it takes several months for the water to warm up. The North Atlantic gets warmest in those months because of all the insolation during the previous months. Remember, water requires a lot of energy to be warmed up and a lot to be cooled down, so after a few months of heating up in the summer, the north Atlantic gets warm enough to produce hurricanes (same goes for typhoons in the North Pacific)<br>   Typhoons are more powerful and have a longer season because there is more water being warmed up in the Pacific than the Atlantic, simply because the Pacific is a bigger ocean

Uiab4hSaaa	Phoenix was a robotic spacecraft on a space exploration mission on Mars under the Mars Scout Program. The Phoenix lander descended on Mars on May 25, 2008. Mission scientists used instruments aboard the lander to search for environments suitable for microbial life on Mars, and to research the history of water there.<br>  <br>  The multi-agency program was headed by the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, under the direction of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The program was a partnership of universities in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, NASA, the Canadian Space Agency, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, Lockheed Martin Space Systems, MacDonald Dettwiler & Associates (MDA) and other aerospace companies.[1] It was the first mission in NASA history led by a public university.[2] The mission also underscored the value of university-led management. This was the first such NASA mission to Mars and it was led by the University of Arizona, a public university, and run directly from the University's campus in Tucson, with project management at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and project development at Lockheed Martin in Denver, Colorado. The operational funding for the mission extended through November 10, 2008.<br>  <br>  Phoenix is NASA's sixth successful landing out of the twelve attempts (seven American, four Soviet/Russian, and one British) that have reached the planet to date (at least two other Russian attempts failed before leaving earth orbit), and is the most recent spacecraft to land successfully on Mars (as of December, 2008). It is also the first successful landing in a Martian polar region. The lander last made a brief communication with Earth on November 2, and the mission was declared concluded on November 10, 2008, after engineers were unable to re-contact the craft<br>  YOU WILL KNOW ALL DETAILS HERE<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(spacecraft)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(sp...</a>

Hyperelastic materials do not follow linear stress-strain relationships so Hooke's law does not apply for them.

DXh2BlCraa	Perhaps the most significant problem is the deadly mix between assisted suicide and<br>  profit-driven managed health care. Health maintenance organizations (HMO's) and<br>  managed care bureaucrats are already overruling doctors' treatment decisions, sometimes<br>  hastening patients' deaths. The cost of the lethal medication generally used for assisted<br>  suicide is about $35 - $50, far cheaper than the cost of treatment for most long-term<br>  medical conditions. The incentive to save money by denying treatment is already a<br>  significant danger; it would be far greater if assisted suicide is legal.

How, for example, could "cytology" or "paediatric pathology" or "renal pathology" be an organ system? What you need to do is read up on the contents of the mediastinum (tumours can arise from any of these tissues), and then do some research on the spread of cancers from other regions of the body to the mediastinal lymph nodes. Finally, you can investigate how enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes can be the result of inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis and amyloid.

Start by dividing the larger number by the smaller, and writing down the remainder: 120 ÷ 72 leaves remainder 48.<br>  Then divide the smaller of the last two numbers (72) by that remainder (48), and write down the remainder again. Keep doing this until you get to zero:<br>  <br>  120 ÷ 72 leaves r 48<br>  72 ÷ 48 leaves r 24<br>  48 ÷ 24 leaves r 0<br>  <br>  When you get to zero, the *previous* remainder is your GCF: 24.<br>  <br>  Lots of ways to do the problem.

1l8KBXsbaa	There are certain aspects of photosynthesis in plants that help reduce water loss. The one that comes to mind right now is the cactus. Plants require CO2 to photosynthesize, and therefore have to breath through their leaves. Cacti will close their pores during the heat of the day preventing moisture from leaving through their pores. The pores will reopen at night allowing the plant to breath. It has a more intricate system of photosynthesis because of this. It has to store the energy from the sun during the day and then use CO2 after dark to make energy it can use. It is less efficient than normal photosynthesis, but works well for cacti.|`|3jQsbszpaa	it doesn't. plant's use photosynthesis is what plants use to make their food.

EOqxenK9aa	Re 1: Work done is spent here in two ways: some is spent to speed the box up (increase its kinetic energy), and some is spent as heat. This is basic conservation of energy: the work you put in has to go "somewhere".<br>  <br>  So, you apply work, and you end up with kinetic energy and heat. Work is simply force * distance, so you know it as those are given. Then you know the final speed, so you know the kinetic energy. It'll be (should be!) less than the work applied. So now you know the remainder of the work which was spent into heat.<br>  <br>  2. First, you have to get the net force. You do it by recalling that forces are vectors. You were given magnitudes of two forces and their directions, now we convert them to components of the force along the direction of the motion. If we choose positive force to be in the forward direction, you'll end up with some net positive force.<br>  <br>  Then, from one law of dynamics (force = mass * acceleration) you get the acceleration that the car was subjected to. Since speed is acceleration * time, you will get the time that the car had to accelerate.<br>  <br>  And then, you will find an equation for a distance travelled given a constant acceleration and time. There is your distance.

E0U2yII3aa	I answered this already yesterday. There was an error in the spelling of the word planet (missing the "e") so someone even answered coniferous and deciduous. I'm not gonna answer it again. Hehehe.., Kidding! There are two types of planets generally in the solar system due to each particulars planet's location during their formation in the early solar system. There are portions of the early solar system where you can collect more material and grow faster than the rest of the planets just as what happened with Jupiter. The farther distance from the early sun constitutes lighter materials but are more plentiful. The location near the sun is perilous to lighter material coz of the danger of being blown by the solar wind from the then more active sun so the inner materials were composed mainly of the heavier terrestrial materials. There are better answers after me, learn to mix them all up for a better answer.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	The differences was chance.<br>    The size,velocity and composition of the debris ejected from the super nova that produced the system were the factors that produced the various planet types.|`|lIEUegRiaa	The inner terrestrial planets are small and rocky, because they are so close to the sun that the lighter elements were burned off and escaped into the outer solar system.<br>  The outer planets are gas giants because they were not close enough to the sun for the heat to burn off these lighter elements. Gravity did the rest - all the volatile elements pushed out from the middle of the Solar System were gathered up by the growing outer planets.

Now rearrange those factors to get (9 * a^2 * b^3) * (9 * a^2 * b^3).  Since each of those factors is the same, it's (9 * a^2 * b^3)^2.  Notice that you can take a shortcut - the square root of the constant, times each variable to HALF the power that it originally was.  <br>  <br>  Similar work shows that 25a^2 = (5a)^2.  Go back and look at the difference of squares "formula" x^2-y^2 = (x+y)(x-y).  If we let 81a^4b^6 = x^2 and  25a^2 = y^2, we see that x^2-y^2 is our original expression.

EOqxenK9aa	1. The answer is pretty trivial once you recall how the Apollo stack looked on Earth: you can't really fit a Saturn V in your school gym. The lander and even the command module that orbited the moon fit quite comfortably in a gym. Since Saturn V is mostly fuel, there is your answer: it takes way, way, way less fuel to get from moon back to Earth. A lot of fuel on Earth was spent hauling some of that fuel up, overcoming atmospheric friction, getting enough velocity to get to orbit, etc.<br>  <br>  kurt.biewald14's answer is completely off mark.<br>  <br>  2. Earth is orbiting around Sun. So, in Earth's orbit, the Earth itself is weightless in relation to Sun. Any change in the Sun's mass would only affect the radius of Earth's orbit, but not our weight on Earth. Our weight on Earth is due to Earth's mass.<br>  <br>  Alas, that's not completely true: there is a curve on Earth's surface at which is the intersection of Earth's orbital sphere with Earth's surface. Anywhere along this curve what I said is 100% true. Everywhere else, we're a tad off-orbit, so we do experience a tiny bit of gravitational pull of the Sun. So perhaps an increase in Sun's weight would be measurable on Earth, if somehow we'd magically teleport to a correct orbit as soon as Sun became heavier, and if we didn't get fried from the Sun's changed heat output :)<br>  <br>  3. You start with some net energy (kinetic + potential), so that energy is staying constant no matter what -- after all, we ignore all dissipative (frictional) effects, and we assume that Earth is parked in deep space with nothing anywhere near to speak of. The net energy is usually calculated relative to something, so it can be positive, negative or zero depending on how you choose it. If you assume that the energy is zero at earth's surface *before* firing, then the net energy will stay positive and equal to the work you've put into the projectile when you fired it. The net energy will stay constant, and we can choose anything  as our "base" energy level. <br>  <br>  I was going to say that question #3 is stupid, but then it occurred to me that the question itself isn't -- its author is. So either you have another uneducated science teacher (that's like 95% of them, if one looks at the questions people post here), or your science book causes Richard Feynman to turn in his grave.

So that's 6*5*4 = 120 different combinations.<br>  <br>  As for how many are less than 400, well since it's a three digit number, the first digit has to be 1, 2 or 3.  We don't have 1 as a choice, so it really has to be 2 or 3.  So if 2 is the first digit, that leaves 5*4 possible combinations for the other two digits.

Long before GPS systems, a compass was the only way to measure the angles. The plot or deed should show a reference to north with an arrow. This is the cartography use (map making) of indicating magnetic north. True north pole lies just north of the Dakotas I believe. There are maps that reference lines of difference to allow calculating the variance. But most maps and deed plots are magnetic. Follow the magnetic heading for 102.5 meters and you should find a another stake.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Tough one. You'd could use astronomy.  The North Star (Polaris) is less than 1 degree from the pole.  If you can borrow some sort of telescope and use it to make accurate surveying marks, you could do it.  However, you'd need very accurate equipment.<br>  <br>  Alternatively true north can be inferred, because you know where you are and where is magnetic north.  It's spherical trigonometry.  You, the magnetic north pole, and the true north pole are three points on a sphere.  If you know the positions, and know the direction of magnetic north, you can work out true north.  However, sometimes there are local magnetic 'anomalies' which make compass measurements inaccurate.<br>  <br>  Contact an astronomer, mathematician or a surveyor!|`|gebIjqnWaa	You have a quandary.

Finite Math vary from institution to institution, at least from State to State, since in some states they may have a standard curriculum for such a course.

Tiph3lQcaa	I would not call you a cynical opportunist. But I do think that you are applying the same old methods to try and rationalize something that you have read in scripture by taking a shred of poorly understood science and twisting it until it fits - just right - then saying that science supports scripture. That is what many fundamentalists do when they are confronted with conflicts that may cast some of their precious dogma into question. <br>  <br>  I must question your initial assumption - that everything possible must occur at some point. I think that that premise is based on either:<br>  <br>  1. An infinite amount of time, which is out of the question if it started at a finite point and it has not ended yet.<br>  <br>  2. An infinite amount of universes (the old parallel universe idea) which I find to be tiresome and basically a cop out to avoid difficult math.<br>  <br>  So - no - I would say that your premise is false and therefore you have no basis to claim science as justification for your belief system. Sorry.<br>  <br>  ADDED: Please note: I did not say that the parallel universe idea rules out the possibility of a creator God. In fact, it probably includes it. What I said was that the parallel universe idea is not meaningful to me - not because of its relationship to religion - but simply because it cannot ever be proved. All it consists of is - essentially - a way to get around the weird effects of quantum mechanics by creating other universes. This solves all the difficult math, but avoids sort of fundamental questions like: Where does the energy come from to continue re-creating universes at a near - infinite rate? or How can we demonstrate that these things really exist? That's where the arm-waving begins, whereupon my eyes glaze over as the theories expand to fill the available (one) universe.|`|eK92GmdOaa	"everything that is imaginable is therefore ultimately inevitable with absolute certainty"<br>  <br>  No. I can imagine myself flying with absolutely no technological aid.

I see a few problems with your analysis.<br>  <br>  First of all, from a standpoint of rigorous mathematics, in order to discuss probability (and I'll guess statistics as well) you need to work within a measurable event space and be able to determine the set of all possible events.  Mathematics by its very nature is true independently of the external world, so when you claim it can be applied to "everything imaginable" I think you need to argue that in more depth.<br>  <br>  Second, if you meant that given enough time, even the most improbable (but still possible) things will eventually happen, then I agree.  But that's not what you said, and what you said has not ever been backed by any scientist I know of, though a philosopher whose name escapes me tried (badly) something like it to prove the existence of God.  The problem is the word "imaginable".  There are many imaginable things that are physically impossible and cannot ever happen no matter how much time you allow.

My world view (I'm not sure it qualifies as a theory as it's not testable) is that the universe is an abstract mathematical object or set of rules, existing in "design space" - the infinite-dimensioned space of all possible things (an extension of an idea from Daniel Dennett). Most of the universes that are possible do not have intelligent life in them, and it is only when a universe creates an intelligence that can perceive the universe that that universe becomes what we commonly refer to as "real".<br>  So, the set of universes that contain life is a very tiny subset of all possible universes. Since there are an infinite number of possible universes, and there are no constraints on the initial conditions or rule set of the universe, could some universes begin with a creator God?<br>  <br>  OK, to your question:<br>  <br>  "in a theoretical multiverse of limitless 'possibilities', why is a universe with a creator god any more or less plausible than a universe without gravity?"<br>  <br>  In a word, complexity. A creator god is vastly more complex than gravity. Gravity is a simple set of rules. The mechanism behind gravity may be a little more complex than the Newtonian laws, but we can say with some confidence that it is going to be a simple mechanism. All the laws of the universe seem to be fundamentally simple mechanisms. The universe is just as complex as it needs to be to create intelligent life, and no more.<br>  Now, there may be possible universes that begin with a built-in intelligence, but they are much, much more complex than ours. Intuitively then they ought to be proportionally less likely. There ought to be far fewer "built-in intelligence" universes in design space than "dumb" universes. Therefore, if you find yourself living in a universe, it is much more likely to be a dumb universe where intelligence evolved spontaneously than a universe that began with an intelligence.<br>  <br>  Another objection is that the creator god by definition has to be outside the universe. He then has to have the ability to create a sub-universe. OK, let's assume he has also spontaneously acquired that power. Then why would he create a sub-universe that looks just like one of those dumb universes that spontaneously generate life? Why not make it a bit more rococo, with planets made of meringue for instance? He might at least show some evidence of his existence to the inhabitants, otherwise, what's the point?<br>  <br>  It comes down to this: If there is absolutely no evidence for a creator, there is absolutely no reason to believe in one.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	No, it is not, as gods and other supernatural entities are not observable or predictable. <br>  <br>  Of course you can't exclude them - there can probably be a God. But do you always need a God as explanation for something? Is a stone falling down or the sunrise depending on the goodwill of a God, or on reliable, unconscious physical laws?<br>  <br>  If God exists, we have not found him. And if he does not exist (which is logically impossible to prove, for the incompleteness of our understanding of  the universe), this will not make the world suddenly end. <br>  <br>  Science is not about what you believe. Believes belong into the church. Science is about what you really know. If you are not sure, if you know something, you believe it. In the best case, your are sure enough, that your scientific believe is working, that it becomes a hypothesis. For example, the belief that all objects in vacuum would fall at the same speed (Galileo's theory of gravity). He was not sure first. It could possibly been wrong, as it sounds absurd. How can a feather fall as fast as a stone? But it was possible to test his believes, so it became a hypothesis. By testing it, it was soon known, that Galileo was right. His hypothesis became a theory. <br>  <br>  So, yes, you are just a unscientific opportunist, who did not work scientific at all. You do not know and you can not tell how to test your claims. You have not even a hypothesis. <br>  <br>  It is just like the claim of extraterrestrial intelligent species: We do not know, if we are not alone. You can't make a prediction: There will be ET.

KHeR3hGIaa	Well, `boiler room' can mean several different things.<br>  <br>  Assuming that you just mean a room with a boiler, and want to know how a boiler works, that's easy enough ...<br>  <br>  In a boiler a liquid is heated and maybe vaporized.  Usually the liquid is water.  Once heated, the water or steam is used to heat the rest of the building, but it can be used for other things as well.<br>  <br>  I could go into a lot more detail, but the wikipedia pages below cover the issue pretty well.  (And I've included pages for other type of boiler rooms, in case you're asking about one of the other types.)|`|uM2IZBobaa	A boiler room usually contains all the components that the heating system needs to function properly.  All these equipment items need routine and preventative maintenance, so it makes practical sense to put them in a room together.<br>  <br>  Depending on the type of boiler, there may be pumps, expansion tanks and air separators in the room.  There could also be related components like glycol feeder tanks and heat exchangers too.
IjcmAmGbaa	The basis for comparing explosive strength or energy is TNT (trinitrotoluene or tolite). <br>  Ammonium nitrate, when it could explode (in drastic conditions : after a long fire or due to primary explosion like this due to a bombing, it is the reason why the real causes of AZF explosion are still unknown, unlike what some papers have said) has a TNT equivalent of about 0.3. It means that for getting the same impact as 100 t TNT, you need to let explode between 300 t of ammonium nitrate, it is the quantity which explodes in Toulouse. A military bomb contains, I guess,  explosives which are more energetical  than TNT, so with a lower mass of bomb than ammonium nitrate you will get the same damages as in Toulouse, but don't think you would get the same result with less than at least many dozens of tons.

IfyieUe1aa	No, v=v+at is|`|EOqxenK9aa	If you don't know the answer to that, you probably don't understand how to check it in the first place. What you essentially do is replace all the variables by their units, and then try and carry out the mathematical operations.<br>  <br>  If foobar is a variable, then by [foobar] I'll mean "the units of foobar", and L-length, T-time. L, T and the like are abstract units. Abstract, because we don't say they are anything in particular. In SI units, they would be L=m (metre) and T=s (second), but dealing with abstract units makes the discussion more general.<br>  <br>  [v] + [a*t^2] = L/T + (L/T^2)*(T^2) = L/T + L -- you can't add different units, so no, it's not consistent.<br>  <br>  As someone else indicated, if you try [v] + [a*t], it's consistent:<br>  [v]+[a*t] = L/T + (L/T^2)*T = L/T + L/(T*T) * T = L/T + L/T = L/T.<br>  <br>  Operations on those abstract units work as if you had variables with names L, T, M, etc, but you drop any constant factors. Normally L/T+L/T = 2 L/T, but we drop the factor. We of course don't drop *powers*, so M^2 is not equal to M.

IB4uC5bIaa	When fall turns to winter and the temperature dips, the food sources for the wild animals becomes very scarce.  Some animals wait out the harsh conditions of winter, constantly searching for food and shelter.  Other animals, like the bear, spend the winter in hibernation. <br>       Hibernation is a dormant sleep-like state.  By going into hibernation the bears bypass winter when their food supply, nuts and berries, disappears.  Animals like the bear would find it extremely difficult to find enough food during winter, and therefore go into hibernation. <br>  <br>       During hibernation the bear cuddles up in a cave or in a hollowed out tree, safe from the dangers of winter.  In order to survive this long period of inactivity the bear must build up its body weight by accumulating fat.  In the months before  hibernation bears can gain up to forty pounds of fat per week.   A bear’s body goes through several changes once it enters hibernation.  Its heartbeat drops from fifty-five beats per minute to ten beats per minute, and the bear’s body temperature will drop from five to nine degrees below normal.  While in hibernation the bear uses  the stored energy it accumulated as fat to survive.  So a bear can lose from fifteen to forty percent of its body weight during the winter just by sleeping! <br>  <br>       Bears will generally enter hibernation in early October and emerge sometime in April or May, when their food is plentiful again.  The hibernation cycle is just another unique adaptation of nature that allows many animals like the bear to survive during the severe conditions of winter time<br>  <br>  And the person who also wrote that should have credited their source!|`|xuvFf5T8aa	Bears hibernate because in winter, it becomes very hard for them to find food.

Their surface/volume ratio is too small to allow them to adjust their body temperature to a state of true hibernation.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	When fall turns to winter and the temperature dips, the food sources for the wild animals becomes very scarce.

X4EBNoNUaa	The partially digested food coming from the stomach is at a pH of 4-5. The pancreas releases bicarbonate to raise the pH to 7.4 - 7.8 or so so that the serine proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin can function ( their pH optimum is ~ 7.5-8 ) to digest dietary proteins. Also pancreatic lipase  and amylase have  pH optima above 7. The small intestine has projections ( villi ) into the lumen of the intestine that are covered with smaller still projections called microvilli. These areas are rich in absorptive cells called enterocytes and because of the very large surface area of the villi/microvilli the mass transfer is highly efficient. This allows rapid uptake of nutrients following digestion...In diseases like celiac or sprue..the villi are not developed or have been destroyed and thus nutrient absorption is greatly compromised

To ionize a gas cloud a star must have enough UV energy at the distance from the cloud. Remember, these ionization clouds are not bright. The bright ones such as the Orion Nebula are reflection clouds.

FT4mVJMzaa	You are thinking of Newton's theory of gravity, in which gravity is a force between two massive bodies. That theory is wrong.<br>  <br>  Light bends due to gravity because gravity is a bending of the spacetime through which it travels. Light, and all other freely falling bodies, travel in the straightest possible path through a curved spacetime. It has nothing to do with its own gravity.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, light rays do bend spacetime (by undetectably tiny amounts) themselves, but in very different ways from stationary masses.|`|nrTDOs6aaa	Because black holes bend the fabric of space, and light travels along with it.<br>  imagine a bed sheet being held out with a golf ball in the middle. the bed sheet would bend under the ball, forcing the sheets edges to curve towards it.<br>  then imagine pouring a trickle of water down the bed sheet (this is the light), even though the water is traveling in a straight line, it will still follow the curves of the sheet and end up in the center with the ball|`|ympdSLlZaa	light belongs to the electromagnetic spectrum and is so affected by elements that have magnetic properties.

AA12191309	It all depends upon the static inertia (in case of acceleration) and the dynamic inertia (in case of deceleration) of the load that is coupled to the motor. For example, if a 5HP, 1440 RPM motor drives a centrifugal pump, it may take about 6 to 8 seconds to accelerate to 1440 RPM from rest and approximately the same time to decelerate too. But, if the same motor is coupled to a blower or fan, then it will take about 15 to 20 seconds to accelerate as the inertia of  a blower is higher. There are precise calculations possible to calculate the acceleration time & deceleration time for any given load.|`|ssK4oJi9aa	it depends on the the motor torque versus speed curve, the load torque versus speed curve, the current versus speed curve along with the rotating inertia. see reference cited below for details.|`|PDcnXgE6aa	Generally low voltage AC Induction motors takes 6-8seconds to reach full speed.......<br>  But medium and high volatge motors takes less time.......may be from 2 to 5 secs.....<br>  <br>  U can find out by looking at ammeter.....on starting Induction motor takes 5-6 times of its full load current, but once it reaches to full load speed ....it current reduces.<br>  Just measure the time for which current it 5 times of full load current.|`|cMsC5a14aa	Get a stop-watch and find out just depends on what the motor is pulling

17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	No, this is a very poor telescope, and I would not recommend it to anyone. It uses a short focal ratio spherical mirror and a built-in Barlow lens to achieve its focal length; this design is hard to adjust and suffers from serious optical flaws preventing it from magnifying more than about 100x. The tripod and mount are shaky and will be very difficult for a beginner to operate. The motor drive compensates for the Earth's rotation once you've found something, but does not make finding objects any easier.The eyepieces provide different magnifications.<br>  <br>  Here are a few web pages with good information on beginner's telescopes:<br>  <a href="http://www.gaherty.ca/tme/TME0702_Buying_a_Telescope.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaherty.ca/tme/TME0702_Buying...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.scopereviews.com/begin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scopereviews.com/begin.html</a><br>  <a href="http://observers.org/beginner/j.r.f.beginner.html" rel="nofollow">http://observers.org/beginner/j.r.f.begi...</a><br>  <br>  For more advanced information, read Phil Harrington's Star Ware, 4th edition (Wiley).<br>  <br>  You'll get the greatest value for your money with a Newtonian reflector on a Dobsonian mount, such as these:<br>  <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/category/~category_id=dobsonians/~pcategory=telescopes/~VIEW_INDEX=0/~VIEW_SIZE=1000000" rel="nofollow">http://www.telescope.com/control/categor...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.skywatchertelescope.net/swtinc/product.php?class1=1&class2=106" rel="nofollow">http://www.skywatchertelescope.net/swtin...</a><br>  <br>  Buy from a store which specializes in telescopes and astronomy, either locally or online; don't buy from department stores, discount stores or eBay as mostly what they sell is junk.

Low end EQ mounts are typically not very stable. See below for the alternative. The idea with an equatorial mount is that you align the mount with the Earth's axis of rotation.  The idea of a motor is that it moves the scope so that when you get something into your field of view, it stays there.<br>  <br>  This telescope has a 114 mm aperture.  That's 4.5 inches.  It also has a 1000 mm focal length.  That's about 40 inches.  So you'd expect the tube in the picture to be nearly ten times longer than the diameter.  It isn't.  The tube looks pretty short.  What they've done is used a shorter focal length primary mirror and a 2x or so focal reducer, typically somewhere in the focuser.  While this sort of thing can be made to work in theory, in practice, the performance is less good.<br>  <br>  It comes with a 6x30 finder scope.  Some people will say that you're better off with a non-magnifying telrad or red dot finder.  I like a magnifying finder, especially in high light pollution.<br>  <br>  It comes with two eyepieces, 9mm (112x) and 20mm (50x).  These give you different magnification.  112x is higher power, and would be better for the Moon and planets, while 50x is better for extended objects like galaxies, and nebulae, since it should give you a wider field of view.<br>  <br>  So, instead of getting a cheap EQ mount, which very likely bounces all over the place for five or ten seconds after you touch it, you should get a Dobsonian mount (often called a Dob mount).  These are very inexpensive to make, and are rock solid.  But since this mount design sits low to the ground, what you want is a telescope design that puts the eyepiece at the top end.  That's a Newtonian reflector.  And, it turns out that Newtonian reflectors are simple and therefore inexpensive.  It's reasonably easy to build them at high quality.<br>  <br>  The cheapest scope i recommend is $200.  It's also 114 mm, and comes with similar magnification eyepieces. It fits in your car.  It sets up quickly.  It has great optics and has a rock solid steady mount.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=dobsonians/~pcategory=telescopes/~product_id=09804" rel="nofollow">http://www.telescope.com/control/product...</a><br>  <br>  For $250, you can something similar, but with 6" (150 mm) of aperture.  Bigger aperture means more light, which means you can see dimmer objects.  It comes with a single eyepiece.  You'll want to pick up a 10 mm eyepiece (about $50) fairly soon after buying this instrument.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=dobsonians/~pcategory=telescopes/~product_id=08942" rel="nofollow">http://www.telescope.com/control/product...</a><br>  <br>  If you want a scope that helps you find things, you can get the above 6" telescope with a computer for $400.  It's a "push to" design, meaning the computer tells you where to point the scope.  It doesn't actually move it. Another bonus is that it comes with the 10 mm eyepiece i mentioned you'll want.  I have the larger 10" version of this instrument.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=dobsonians/~pcategory=telescopes/~product_id=27182" rel="nofollow">http://www.telescope.com/control/product...</a>|`|MMUGLjsPaa	You may want to think about your decision to buy this scope.<br>  Let me start by saying, this has nothing to do with the manufacturer.<br>  <br>  There is a true saying In astronomy: "Aperture is King". In other words the opening in your scope that receives light should be as large as possible.  This scope only has 114mm diameter (4.48 inches).  <br>  <br>  To really see some of the cool night sky objects you should really consider a larger diameter scope like 8" - 10" reflecting telescope.<br>  <br>  Also, having a motorized scope doesn't necessarily mean that it will help you find objects.  The scope must have "Goto" capability and that is not advertised with the Zhumell scope.  Rather the "motorized tracking" means that once you have the object in your field of view (FOV), the scope will track the earths rotation keeping the object always in your FOV.<br>  <br>  I've included a link below on how to buy a telescope.  Please read it before you buy one.  Also, if there is a local astronomy club near the place where you live then please attend one of their meetings.  You'll find the people there will be very helpful with information on what makes a decent scope without blowing your budget.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you still want to buy scope I've included a link to orion telescopes.  I don't endorse the company but IMHO they make decent telescopes in the 8" - 10" range.<br>  <br>  One more thing about motorized scopes.  I own a 10" Goto scope which I love.  However, out of the box it took time to master. My first 6 months were pretty frustrating.  A decent 8" dobsonian (non motorized) scope only takes about 30seconds to setup and get going.  Also, you can learn the sky a lot faster with a dobsonian because you're not leaning on your computer as a crutch to point you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your search for a telescope.

MsmvYJ3Daa	Yes, you've given the easiest route if you just want to work it out for this example<br>  <br>  Given that you know the repayment amount (which I'll assume is correct), then you can work out how much the interest is for the year (0.06*120,000)=7,200. The total repayments made are 782.27x12=9387.24. So, the capital repayment is the difference, or 2,187.24. Expressing this as a fraction 2,187.27/120,000= about 1.8% of the capital paid off in the first year.

EOZsYlZkaa	An ionic compound is formed when two elements bond together by donating or accepting electrons, such as Na and Cl. Na donates an electron and Cl accepts and electron yielding Na+ and Cl-. Because of their opposite charges, they are attracted to each other and form the compound NaCl. However, when joined NaCl is not completely neutral; there is still a net charge which causes other NaCl molecules to be attracted. This results in a lattice formation of many NaCl molecules, creating a crystal structure, which would be an ionic structure.
WkWedRnoaa	I think the answer is around 10000 feet (3000 meters) although I didn't do the math or find a citation for it.  This was a number I remember hearing long ago.<br>  <br>  The oceans and connected seas take up 71% of the Earth's surface and have an average depth of over 12400 feet.  Using the continents to fill in the deepest parts of the ocean, leaving a uniform depth sea floor over the entire sphere of the earth would give around 10000 feet in depth to the water.

Yellow dwarfs live <br>  about 10 billion years (from zero-age main sequence to white dwarf <br>  formation), and our Sun is already about 5 billion years old.<br>  <br>  Main sequence stars (like our Sun) are those that fuse hydrogen into<br>  helium, though the exact reactions vary depending on the mass of the<br>  star. The main sequence phase is by far the most stable and<br>  long-lived portion of a star's lifetime; the remainder of a star's<br>  evolution is almost an afterthought, even though the results of that<br>  evolution are what are most visible in the night sky. As the Sun<br>  ages, it will increase steadily in luminosity. In approximately 5<br>  billion years, when the hydrogen in the Sun's core is mostly<br>  exhausted, the core will collapse---and, consequently, its temperature<br>  will rise---until the Sun begins fusion helium into carbon. Because<br>  the helium fuel source will release more energy than hydrogen, the<br>  Sun's outer layers will swell, as well as leaking away some of its<br>  outer atmosphere to space. When the conversion to the new fuel source<br>  is complete, the Sun will be slightly decreased in mass, as well as<br>  extending out to the current orbit of Earth or Mars (both of which<br>  will then be somewhat further out due to the Sun's slightly decreased<br>  mass). Since the Sun's fuel source will not have increased in<br>  proportion to its size, the blackbody power law indicates that the<br>  surface of the Sun will be cooler than it is now, and will become a<br>  cool, deep red. The Sun will have become a red giant.<br>  <br>  A few tens or hundreds of millions of years after the Sun enters its <br>  red giant phase (or "helium main sequence"; the traditional main <br>  sequence is occasionally referred to as the hydrogen main sequence to <br>  contrast the other main sequences that a massive star enters), the Sun <br>  will begin to exhaust its fuel supply of helium. As before, when the <br>  Sun left the (hydrogen) main sequence, the core will contract, which <br>  will correspondingly lead to an increase in temperature in the core.<br>  <br>  For very massive stars, this second core collapse would lead to a <br>  carbon main sequence, where carbon would fuse into even heavier <br>  elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen. However, the Sun is not <br>  massive enough to support the fusion of carbon; instead of finding <br>  newer fuel sources, the Sun's core will collapse until degenerate <br>  electrons---electrons which are in such a compressed state that their <br>  freedom of movement is quantum mechanically restricted---smashed <br>  together in the incredible pressures of the gravitational collapse, <br>  will halt the core's collapse. Due to the energy radiated away during <br>  the process of the formation of this electron-degenerate core, <br>  the atmosphere of the Sun will be blown away into space, forming what <br>  astronomers call a planetary nebula (named such because it resembles a <br>  planetary disk in the telescope, not because it necessarily has <br>  anything to do with planets). The resulting dense, degenerate core is <br>  called a white dwarf, with a mass of something like the Sun compressed <br>  into a volume about that of the Earth's.<br>  <br>  White dwarfs are initially extremely hot. But since the white dwarf<br>  is supported by degenerate electrons, and has no nuclear fuel to speak<br>  of to create more heat, they have no alternative but to cool. Once<br>  the white dwarf has cooled sufficiently---a process which will take<br>  many billions of years---it is called an exhausted white dwarf, or a<br>  black dwarf.  7|`|N7Ece4PRaa	If you exploded, wouldn't you also die?|`|JxxZpxqmaa	Not in our lifetime.|`|IqtzkgyBaa	ITS TRUE THE SUN HAS TERM or UNIVERSE<br>  GOD WILL MAKE NEW UNIVERSE<br>  <br>  BIBLE AND QURAN SPEAKS ON THAT !<br>  <br>  THERE KNOW END TO HUMAN BEINGS (GENERATION), BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS IS BEFORE THE UNIVERSE,  His Nature is our nature.|`|E0U2yII3aa	It will certainly die but it will not explode in a "supernova sense", if that is what you mean.

UFteXlqwaa	The wind you observe is often the result of different atmospheric phenomenons. The spin of the earth resulting in the Coriolis effect, affects very large atmospheric bodies over entire latitudes. Low and high pressure regions affect the wind over one part or another of a continent. Last, the local geography influences local wind patterns.<br>  <br>  If you wonder about the wind during daytime, I suppose you wonder about what can affect the wind direction between day and night, and not between e.g. tropical or frontal high and low pressures.<br>  <br>  The vicinity of a large body of water can affect the daytime wind pattern. During the day, a lower pressure develops over land and a sea breeze blowing onshore appears.<br>  <br>  In mountainous regions, the rising of the air from the valleys, a.k.a. anabatic wind, may appear on a nice, otherwise windless, sunny day.<br>  <br>  Both those systems reverse during the night. Near the sea, the wind blows offshore and in the mountains, the cold air sinks in the valley, creating a katabatic wind.|`|KHjYq2bHaa	Wind blows due to uneven heating.

wJTsifugaa	"Concentrated" is a relative term that usually means having a small amount of water in it, so the solution consists mostly of acid molecules.  It is relative because it can change based on what is commercially available, which is why most often the actual percentage is also stated.  In fuming acids, the gaseous molecule that combines with water to make the acid is added to the concentrate, until there is no more water.  Then, an additional amount of the gas is added to the acid, up to a stated percentage.  If you look at the acid, fumes of the gas rise off of the surface, so giving the name "fuming."<br>  <br>  This extra gas is available to make acid when water is added to it, so it is a way to get as much potentially acid forming molecules per unit volume as possible.<br>  <br>  Fuming nitric is HNO3-xNO2 and fuming sulfuric is H2SO4-xSO3|`|797Bf914aa	"Concentrated" is a relative term, meaning having more solute than "dilute".

In the case of sulphuric, the actual compound is H2SO4?SO3, which is often written as H2S2O7 and is called "oleum".<br>  <br>  Bottom line:  "Fuming" is fairly well defined; "Concentrated", in some cases, may be considered synonymous.|`|UXf6g6Sjaa	Concentrated nitric acid contains 20% water.<br>  White fuming nitric acid is pure HNO3.<br>  Red fuming nitric acid is HNO3 containing dissolved NO2.<br>  <br>  Idk why they call it "concentrated" when it contains water, but they always have done.

A serious deficiency therefore remains in current theories of the structure and evolution of stars. Since stars must be forming at the present phase of Galactic evolution, it is pertinent to investigate what conditions favour star formation. Observational evidence for the pre-main sequence phase of stellar evolution is entirely absent apart from that obtained about a single class of proto-stellar objects - the T-Tauri stars. Most theories of star formation require stars to form from the interstellar gas. The existing knowledge of the interstellar gas is not sufficient to define the initial conditions for star formation precisely. However, recent theoretical and observational studies are forcing a radical revision of interstellar concepts. Theoretical studies suggest that interstellar gas clouds may well be transient phenomena and that continuous variation of interstellar conditions may be expected. The observational studies have shown that the previously accepted enumeration of interstellar species may well be far from complete.<br>  <br>  Four major groups of star formation theory are identified. These deal with formation by collapse under gravity, by random accretion, by condensation, and by processes associated with the activity of galactic nuclei. Considerable attention is given to the theory of collapse under gravity since this is regarded as the major theory of star formation on the ground that its conceptional framework is better defined than that of the others. It is also a theory capable of further specific investigation. It is, however, pointed out that no theory of star formation can be regarded as definitive and that each group of theories has significant contributions to make to a subject where the essential problems - though simple in conception - may not be well posed.<br>  <br>  The recent numerical investigations of star formation within the context of star formation through collapse under gravity are summarized. These new investigations have shown that one of the basic problems of collapse under gravity (namely the separation of a collapsing region of stellar mass from a very much larger parent cloud or fragmentation) may no longer be a problem in that fragmentation may be inevitable within non-uniform gas clouds collapsing under gravity. The numerical studies have shown that collapse under gravity takes a characteristic form. Such studies have enhanced the prospects for a renewed attack on the problem of collapse under gravity, in view of the possibility of relaxation of the severe constraint imposed by the assumption of spherical symmetry. Numerical studies, by taking account of atomic processes and the detailed structures of gas clouds, seem likely to lead to a clearer definition of the conditions necessary for star formation and to give form to a detailed theory of star formation replacing the more speculative attempts to do so which are reviewed here.

As you can see in the equation the force will change if R, the radius from the center of mass is altered. <br>  <br>  In the case of the mountains you are increasing this radius and hence decreasing the force so you would weigh less.<br>  <br>  In an airplane, assuming it is moving at a constant velocity (this is important as acceleration could alter your weight) it is the same priniciple as the mountains, you increase R so you decrease your weight.<br>  <br>  The earth is not a perfect sphere so again at the poles your weight is altered again, i believe it will increase as the earth is squashed vertically, although i'm not 100% sure of that. Again the radius changes.<br>  <br>  In the sea, you are closer to the centre of mass of the earth so again R is chanced and your weight increases|`|nKCMRLysaa	Alex was right about using the gravitation equation as the altitude changes.<br>  <br>  The weight is also affected by the buoyancy of the fluid the mass is in. This will reduce the weight in the sea. If the material floats, its weight in the sea is zero. For very accurate weighing, you need to allow for the buoyancy of the air, which depends on the air pressure. Pressure changes with altitude, and the air pressure inside an aircraft is usually different from the air pressure outside.<br>  <br>  The weight also depends on the position on the earth's surface, because of the earth's rotation. This reduces the weight at the equator compared with the poles.|`|5tY0sbSJaa	centre of gravity is defined as point where the whole mass of the body is concentrated at a single point.to find the centre of gravity firstly divide the given object into as many as internal strips and find the moment of inertia of the every strip with reference to the single point considering from a single point with different referance axis.such that the moment of inertia of the point with respect to every frame should be same.|`|IfyieUe1aa	In Egypt you will have less mass, then in North and South pole,<br>  <br>  because we don't measure the mass, we measure PRESSURE. <br>  Try measure the mass of the same thing in a lift.

EOqxenK9aa	Re 1: The electric field strength is defined as a force that a point charge experiences per unit of its charge: E = F/q. Set up two separate equations using Coulomb's law to get the force of attraction of your "test" point charge q to either known point charges. The forces simply add up vectorially (make sure you get the signs right!). Then plug the total force into  the equation for the field strength. You have to do it symbolically (do not plug in numbers), and you will see that your "test" charge q gets divided out from the final equation.<br>  <br>  Re 2: And the circuit is?...

FLgE0xAJaa	Catnipcraze doesn't know what he's talking about.<br>  <br>  Black holes were originally a theoretical concept derived from Einstein's theory of relativity.<br>  <br>  Over the past several decades numerous black holes have been found because of their gravitational effects. In fact, it appears that every major galaxy, including our own, has a massive black hole in its center. These black holes have masses that are several million times that of ordinary stars such as our sun. <br>  <br>  More ordinary black holes are found scattered throughout our galaxy and are the result of the stellar life cycle.  During its life cycle a star progressively fuses hydrogen into helium and the helium into a new series of products. How far up the scale of elements these products go is dependent upon the mass of the star. Stars with a mass of around that of our sun stop the process relatively early (after about 10 billion years), and turn into a white dwarf after going through an expansion phase. <br>  <br>  When stars with a mass of more than about eight times that of our sun end their life cycle, the fusion process occurs much faster because of the enormous energies produced. Stars with a mass of around eight times that of our sun on up to about fifty times that of our sun continue to produce further elements up the scale and stop at iron because iron fusion absorbs energy rather than produces it. With the loss of energy the star collapses upon its core in an enormous explosion called a supernova. The core of the star remains in a form called a neutron star.<br>  <br>  If the star has a mass of more than 50 times that of our sun,  the gravitational forces are so strong that the star continues to collapse until the gravitational field is so strong that nothing can escape, not even light. That is what produces this type of black hole.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|houWY7qvaa	For them not to be proven there is much discussion on black holes and relatively to this day, it is being said that there is more than one. It is a hole tearing our atmosphere.  Some even think that earth has black holes, especially where aircraft, ships and others disappeared from the face of the earth near the Bermuda Triangle.  Some say our universe as vast as it is, could be one of many.  The black holes lead outside of our realm.  I'm surprised to find that many want to believe we evolve from monkeys or apes, but can't imagine a universe inside or along the outside of another.  Where is all of our research money really going?|`|vY0ScgeXaa	so far black hole is a NON-PROVED THEORY.<br>  <br>  you can also call it a SCIENCE FICTION.<br>  <br>  basically the idea is proposed because it matches the gravity part of the einstein's general relativity theory the best.<br>  <br>  black hole is said to be a giant gravitational hole that would suck in all substance in universe even light.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	As people before me have noted, a black hole is a region of space that has so much mass in it, that the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.  Therefore nothing, not even light, escapes.<br>  <br>  Most black holes are stellar remnants.  They are the result of supernovae that occur at the end of the lives of very massive stars.   There is a theoretical kind of black hole called a 'primordial black hole' that is thought might have been generated in the extreme pressures of the early phases of the universe.  <br>  <br>  Black holes consume everything that falls into them.  Large black holes tend to be very energetic, because any matter falling into them is accelerated to nearly the speed of light.  This causes the matter to heat up to tremendous temperatures, and begin emitting radiation, including hard x-rays.  <br>  <br>  The phenomenon we used to call 'quasars' are now thought to be super-massive black holes at the center of distant galaxies 'feeding' on infalling matter. <br>  <br>  Far from being 'theoretical' or 'science fiction', black holes generate several predictable behaviors, including gravitational lensing, accretion disks, and symmetrical jets.   All of these phenomena are observed.   <br>  <br>  There is very good evidence that a mass of 4 million suns is sitting at the center of the milky way galaxy.  We can observe the motions of stars around this mass, but we cannot directly observe the mass itself.  However, because the stars around it are moving in orbits, we can measure those orbits and use them to calculate the amount of mass.  The region 'flares' from time to time in X-Ray radiation.  This is consistent with our theories regarding black holes.  Because we can constrain the size using the position of those flares, we know that the object is smaller than the orbit of Earth, and probably considerably smaller than that.   The only thing that could be that massive in that small of a region is a black hole. <br>  <br>  By the way, someone that a certain other answerer nicknamed the 'rating goon', has been busy at work in this thread, downrating sensible answers.

qaMPEdL2aa	The key is the pickup on the guitar.  It uses an internal magnet and coil for each string.  The vibrating string changes the reluctance of the magnetic circuit and so it changes the magnetic field as the string vibrates.  This changing field produces a voltage of each string. The voltages are added in the pickup to produce a voltage signal. <br>  <br>  All the amp does is to amplify the voltage and provide some current capability to drive the speakers.  Many modern guitar amps would use analog integrated circuit amplifiers in the input stages and then discrete power transistors in the output stage.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Maybe this will help some...<a href="http://www.skyblueband.net/TubesvsSS.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.skyblueband.net/TubesvsSS.htm</a>

gCn6bXAFaa	Commercial glass house tomato growers use bumble bee colonies for pollination.  Honey bees get confused and wind up crashing repeatedly into the glass.  <br>  <br>  In small scale operations insects aren't necessary.  Tomatoes are both wind pollinated and buzz (insect) pollinated. Buzz pollination means that a specific frequency of vibration is required for the anthers to fully release their pollen. Some say an electric toothbrush or tuning fork helps vibrate the flowers at the right frequency to help release the pollen.  However, in my experience the easiest way to induce pollination is to gently shake the branches every day (around noon) once the flower petals begin to curl back. You should be able to see the pollen drifting off the flower upon shaking.  This combined with your air circulation fan will produce plenty of fruit.

lHpbCKpCaa	All hurricanes rotate in one and same direction, its the direction earth follows that makes Sun seem to be rising in the East. Not a single Hurricane recorded so far rotates otherwise, same stands for each typhoon, twister and tornado. Thus proving that evolution has no room in Hurricane existence or they be rotating in different direction! And also in light of hurricane patterns being one of the oldest clocks man has been observing, just as is the Rotation around Kaba called tawaf in Muslim rites of Pilgrimmage during Hajj in Mecca being over 4 melliniums old ritual shows remarkable similarity with rest of celestial bodies indeed are self evident signs that all things were rotated by a right hand only, if there were another creator or even no creator, the things would be rotating both left hand and right hand around their repsective inner and out axis. Hurricanes attest to the fact that Universe is operating under A1law of axial rotation when observed from north pole, same stands for each and every hurricane as well!|`|BSnwIJ0oaa	"How do hurricanes form?<br>  <br>  Hurricanes are mind-boggling in their size and strength. Modern technology lets us see how big hurricanes are and track them through satellite imagery, while storm-penetrating aircraft measure their strength, in terms of wind speeds and atmospheric pressure. That technology gives us detailed warnings that people a century ago never had.<br>  <br>  Hurricanes usually form in the tropical zones north and south of the equator, where warm waters offer ample fuel for storm formation. That's where you see convection, where warm air rises and forms clusters of thunderstorms. The Coriolis effect, created by the Earth's spinning motion, may cause this cluster of storms to rotate (counter-clockwise above the equator, or clockwise below), but the system has to be a few hundred miles from the equator for the Coriolis force to exert an effect. If the system becomes organized and strong enough, with sustained winds of 39 miles per hour, it becomes a tropical storm. At 74 miles per hour or more, it becomes a hurricane.<br>  <br>  A hurricane can be hundreds of miles across. It's like a big engine, with upper-level winds acting as a vent, pulling the rising warm air away from the storm. Rain bands spiral around the center of the system. Air sinks in the clear center, or eye, which can be from 5 miles to more than 100 miles across.<br>  <br>  Because the atmospheric pressure is so low in the eye, the water rises up there in a sort of mound. This contributes to the devastating storm surge when a hurricane hits land, but most of the surge comes from winds pushing the sea water ahead of the storm, raising ocean levels by several feet.<br>  <br>  When a hurricane hits land, it tends to weaken mostly because it has lost its source of energy - the warm ocean waters. Friction might slow down the surface wind, but it also can enhance turbulence and therefore gusts, scientists have found. "<br>  <br>  The four basic categories of tropical weather events are tropical disturbance, tropical depression, tropical storm and hurricane.<br>  <br>  -A tropical disturbance is an organized tropical weather system that maintains its identity for more than 24 hours.<br>  <br>  -Tropical depressions have maximum sustained wind speeds of 38 mph or less -- stronger tropical storms have maximum sustained wind speeds from 39 to 73 mph.<br>  <br>  -When wind speeds reach 74 mph or more, the storm is upgraded to a hurricane.<br>  <br>  -Hurricanes are further categorized on a scale of increasing intensity known as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, which ranks hurricane strength in Categories 1 to 5.<br>  <br>  -A Category 1 hurricane (winds from 74 to 95 mph) will mainly cause damage to trees and unanchored structures like mobile homes. Low-lying coastal roads can become flooded and some boats may be torn from moorings.<br>  <br>  -In a Category 2 hurricane (winds from 96 to 110 mph), some trees will be blown down. Mobile homes, roofs, piers and signs may sustain considerable damage, but no major damage to buildings will be experienced. Marinas and coastal roads will be flooded.<br>  <br>  -Hurricane Ivan, which struck coastal Alabama in 2004, was a Category 3 storm (winds from 111 to 130 mph). In these hurricanes, mobile homes and buildings near the coast can be destroyed by winds or battering waves. Serious flooding can block roads up to eight miles inland or more. Evacuation may be required near shorelines.<br>  <br>  -In a Category 4 hurricane, like August's Hurricane Katrina, wind speeds range from 131 to 155 mph. Large trees are blown down, beaches suffer major erosion, and roofs, windows and doors are often blown off structures. Escape routes can be cut by floodwaters three to five hours before the hurricane center arrives. Massive evacuations of residences within two miles of shore may be required.<br>  <br>  -The most extreme category of hurricane is Category 5, where winds exceed 156 mph. Hurricane Andrew, which destroyed large swaths of Miami and south Florida in 1992, was a Category 5 hurricane."<br>  <br>  hope this helps (10 points please :D ! )|`|0925cd0b1673d42030a75763d5c46af6aa	The long Island Express Hurricane in 1938 was off the coast of Florida 1 day as a category 4 hurricane and 12 hours later it made landfall in Long Island(hence the name) and it had wind gusts of over 200mph(hello NASCAR anyone? lol) when it made landfall that it had gusts over 158 mph in Mass and in Maine.

YWPJzFoOaa	I think we actually here of more stuff happening at night, because that's when people are starting to settle down and notice more of their surroundings because they're not as busy doing other stuff.  As far as why paranormal investigators do their research at night, that's a question I will ask some friends of mine who actually are investigators and then I'll post the answer.<br>  <br>  *edit** here is a team member's answer to your question: <br>  <br>  "The question asks why is there more activity at night.  This isn't neccessarily true.  It just so happens that the world is a lot quieter at night and our senses aren't as overloaded as they may me during the day.  <br>  <br>  We, as investigators, choose to investigate at night because of the quietness also.  There are less distractions at night.  We turn out the lights so that 'all' our senses are hightened, not just visual, but all the senses.  It also makes it easier to see shadow people, because they tend to not be as visual in bright light for some reason."|`|rvRimbVYaa	They come during the night because all the attention will be focused on them but in some days they appear but only when it is dark and cloudy maybe they hate light. I became a paranormal investigator because a year ago i went in a new hospital where there were medieval buildings (they said) and my mother cause we were a whole family took a photograph and strangely a mist appeared and when i downloaded that photograph on the computer like a strange white face appeared but the computer jammed while i was putting it on youtube and when i was taking the camera to photographer it fall and broke. A week later one of my parentals died. Now a month ago my grandfather at night saw a mist 2 days later he died but they always appear at night.

AA10423630	I think you need to be more specific.  I could write a hundred books about this and still not properly answer your question!
EOqxenK9aa	1) First of all, you need to understand that the force applied at an angle has two components. The horizontal component, parallel to the floor, is the one that speeds the cart up (gives it kinetic energy). The vertical component is simply pushing the cart down against the floor. To get at the components, we multiply the force by trig functions -- either sin or cos. To figure which one to use, think of what happens when the angle is zero (parallel to the floor): all force is then horizontal, and none is vertical. So first, you get Fv (vertical force) and Fh (horizontal force).<br>  <br>  We also need weight, which is simply mass * g, where g is Earth's gravitational acceleration, 9.81 m/s^2.<br>  <br>  Then you realize that the vertical force, pushing the cart down, will cause, together with the weight of the cart, a friction force which acts *against* the cart's motion. So the friction will be pointed the other way, or subtract from, Fh, the pushing force component that moves the cart forward. The friction force is proportional to the total force pushing against the floor (weight + Fv), the constant of the proportionality being the coefficient of friction.  See the wikipedia article about friction. So here you've got your net force Fnet = Fh - Ffriction.<br>  <br>  Now I presume that you were to push the cart 2.05E2 m (metres). Well, this is now a constant-acceleration motion problem, which you will see discussed in a question I previously answered, and also in another wikipedia article I reference.

AA11606721	Polyploidy can occur in any organism but polyploid animal species are uncommon - mostly restricted to parthenogenic invertebrates although there are polyploid fish and lizards. In humans polyploidy (2-3% of all pregnancies) results in miscarriage and/or early death. It may occur in the somatic cells of organs of certain individuals with a normal chromosome number. These cells may not be able to divide and the condition is generally not a good thing.<br>  <br>  Polyploidy quite common in plants that can reproduce vegetatively. <br>  <a href="http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=w71u835730h54018&size=largest" rel="nofollow">http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-previ...</a>|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	The exact frequency is unknown, as many instances are silent.

E0lMycUeaa	hello my friend,i didnt hear from you for so long<br>  <br>  hope you are fine<br>  <br>  as for your question here is a quote from keith moore<br>  <br>  "... because the staging of human embryos is complex, owing to the continuous process of change during development, it is proposed that a new system of classification could be developed using the terms mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah (sayings of Muhammad, peace be upon him). The proposed system is simple, comprehensive, and conforms with present embryological knowledge. The intensive studies of the Quran and Hadith (reliably transmitted sayings and reports of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) in the last four years have revealed a system of classifying human embryos that is amazing since it was recorded in the 7th century A.D. Although Eric Statle, the founder of the science of embryology, realized that chick embryos developed in stages from his studies of hen's eggs in the fourth century B.C., he did not give any details about these stages. As far as it is known from the history of embryology, little was known about the staging and classification of human embryos until the twentieth century. For this reason, the descriptions of the human embryo in the Quran cannot be based on scientific knowledge in the 7th century A.D. The only reasonable conclusion is that these descriptions were revealed to Muhammad from God. He could not have known such details because he was an illiterate man with absolutely no scientific training."
