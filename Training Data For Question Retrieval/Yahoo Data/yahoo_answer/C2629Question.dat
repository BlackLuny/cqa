Hi there :)      My bf just bought a bike (a classic moto guzzi) and he has bought a plain white full face helmet for like 300 pound.      I, however, don't have that money and am also going to have to get a coat... boots etc..      I went to a shop yesterday and found that I am an XL (well , I'm a large but have extensions weaved in my hair so have to go a bit bigger which is a worry!)      I just wondered which is a good make for people with big heads, that are really safe and good quality but not too expensive?      I'd like one that is kinda feminine but nothing fussy, plainer is better for me.      Thanks! x
20090128152912AA4YgUp	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Anyone know what alternative engine for a 1.8 K Freelander?	Has anyone swapped the engine successfully for something better? I've searched the internet for ages now and can only find either fixes or complete replacement K series engines.   There must be an engine that can easily be fitted in place of the dreadfully unreliable K series. Perhaps another rover engine. Ideally need something that is closest to a straight swap with minimal alterations!
20090128153032AAmEheZ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I touched my jumper cables together with the car running - what may have happened?	My car was dead. I got a jump start, and wasn't thinking about what I was doing. While my car was running, and with the cables still connected to my battery, I took them off the other car, and then the cables touched together, sparked, and the battery failed.      The battery was already pretty much dead before this, so I don't care if I fried that. But did I do something to my car?      As of right now, it's not running (because I can't get anywhere to get a new battery).

20090128155611AAzvMmi	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mitsubishi	My 2004 Mitsubishi Eclipse GTS handling on ice and snow is a nightmare. Anyone else?	My 2004 (5 sp manual) Mitsubishi Eclipse GTS handling on ice and snow is a nightmare. I have NEVER driven a car with worse handling than this one. Although I don't currently have snow treads on it, the tires are in very god condition. Is it because the car is overpowered? I mean, you can drive as slow and careful as possible but the car just won't perform safely. It will fail to make it up the most mild-gradient hills. I have just moved from the shoreline where my daily driving was on level terrain to an area full of hills. My new home is on a road with very steep hills at both ends. There has been many occasions when I couldn't get up to my house and just as many when I wouldn't even think about attempting to go down them to get to the main road. I am losing days at work due to the harsh winter we are having and this car.  Before answering, please realize that I am not in a position to get a new car and also that I have lived in the Northeast all of my life and am VERY familiar winter driving. Trust me, this is the car. Can I expect snow treads to take care of this problem? any other Northern Eclipse owners w/ same situation?

I don't now, but I will own another Camaro in the future. It may be that I will end up with the underdog LO3 engine.       I want it to be reliable, but run stronger than stock.

I would prefer to keep the heads and most things stock, and the budget would be very tight.       There's no need to rag on me about it- I know that a lot of people think that building or modifying a Chevy 305 is a total waste of time and money. But I like a challenge.

So usually, I'll warm the car (idle) for 10-15 mins, until I see either the temp gauge or the oil temp gauge start to creep up but someone on here told me that I did not need to idle the car for that long & that 1 or 2 minutes should be sufficient for warm up.

20090128161431AAaoEgb	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Why isn't the Corvette popular in Europe?	Well, it's much more practical and user friendly than a 911.  For example, it has a bigger trunk (boot) than a Mercedes S550.  It gets 28 mpg on the highway, in America, that's comparable to a BMW 3 series.  Then, it has 430 horsepower from one of the best engines ever engineered, and doesn't cost a lot of money for all this either.      Why don't Europeans buy it?

It happens even when I touch the brakes.    It only makes this noise when I'm moving so haven't been able to pinpoint it precisely but sounds as if its coming from behind me and to the left when I'm driving.    The sound is high pitched and started off barely audible but has been getting progressively worse over the past couple of weeks (I've only driven it 4/5 times in that period)    Thanks in advance for your help

20090128145540AAcGxZ4	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Hyundai	My '06 Hyundai Sonata feels like it is "chugging" - anyone?	I've tried to make a log of when this happens but nothing seems to really correlate.  At times it feels like my car is "chugging" as if it is trying to get into the next gear but "chugs" a little bit.  It happens at all different speeds but doesn't happen all of the time.  I am questioning this because my sister has the same car (mine is a 4 cyl hers is a 6 cyl).  Every time it happens it does it for like 20 seconds then goes away.  We use the same dealership for the maintenance of our cars.  The dealer always tells us they don't know what is wrong because it doesn't happen when they test drive it - but that is because it doesn't happen all of the time and of course it doesn't happen when they take it out.  Either way, they recently told my sister it was her fuel line (that it must have been punctured by mice) so they replaced it.  As of yet, she hasn't had the problem.  My car though is still doing it... and my fuel line is fine.  What is really happening here??

I have an Alpine CDE-9874 head unit, which has two RCA outputs in the back.   I recently bought 2 Rockford Fostgate Punch 12 inch subwoofers and an 800 watt amp from my friend, and I also got a good deal on a wiring kit from circuit city which included all the necessary cables and some.      Im under the understanding that with my headunit if i can wire the amp to the RCA outputs in the back i can have control over only the volume and bass of my subs if i choose to.       My question is, in order to do this, do i still need to connect the remote cable from amp to head unit, how do i wire the RCA cables from my head unit to my amp, and what will i need?       Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanksss

20090128165604AAK0Tst	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Jeep	Help! 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee clicker remote?	So i bought a 01 jeep grand cherokee limited edition. The original keys were lost and the dealership made new ones, but without the clicker remote to unlock, lock and disable the panic alarm thing. So i can unlock the car with the key no problem. However every now and then the panic alarm will go off, I'll put the key in the ignition and turn it on and it will stop.       I ran into an old friend.. he said he could get me a clicker button for my jeep (for no $$$ btw) and I'd just have to go to the jeep dealer and they could sync it up with the car.       Now, my question is (I'm not entirely sure this remote is not stolen)  Is there a way that the dealership would be able to tell if it was stolen or not? kinda like the ESN# on a cellphone?      Thanks, I appreciate the help

So I'm running four 10x10, 100 watt )55 watt rms) PA speakers (the things you see at sporting events that they announce over) I have them wired with my two 12" and two 8" kicker speakers in the back which i use as mids, i have a kicker 1000.1 mono block amp pushing power to 2 12" kicker CVR 800w subs, and i have 2 6x9 kicker speakers as highs, i have an equalizer for everything, i have switches that control everything, basicly driving in my car is like piloting an airplane :)      now that you know my setup; here's the question;   I just installed these horns to my mids, and i've added a switch for just them so when i turn it off the mids stay on only the horns  (as i call the PA speakers) turn off.      I have spent a LOT of money to set up my audio, and I just want an amp to power JUST the horns, would a 300 watt 2/1 amp by Dual be enough? Will anything conflict? and yes, you can hear every word with the horns from about 6 city blocks away, clear as day.      Thanks!

20090128165358AAdIQCZ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Not replacing my ignition coils on my car?	So I have a 2000 Nissan Maxima. I guess the ignition coils on it are faulty or something? Well the mechanic told me that there was a service bulletin out on them. She said I needed to replace the three right ones and that to do it they'd also need to replace some other thing. So it's going to cost me about $1100 for all of that. On top of that, apparently my radiator is leaking.      So I really could only afford one for the two and I reasoned that a leaking radiator was a more urgent issue than the coils. The radiator is costing about $400 to replace.      So I probably won't get enough money for the coils until this summer. What is the worst thing that can happen to it? I've already been told that I won't pass smog, but I don't think I need to smog it until a little bit later.      So can not replacing the ignition coil do any major damage to my car? Any long term damage?      And did I make the right decision?

It only does it going down a hill (at about 35mph) I am not giving it very much gas when it shifts, and it is also very cold. Thanks a lot

Its not in the town I live in, its about 8 hours away when I contacted the buyer about buying the car. They said they use "eBay Vehicle Purchase Protection" Then I asked how that worked and she said...      Look how this works:      1. I will contact eBay and give all the info about this deal.   2. They will email us the forms which are needed for our deal.   3. I will send the car to your location and you will send the money at eBay.   4. After you will inspect the car and decide to keep it, eBay will forward the funds to me.   If the car is not suitable for you from any reason, your money will be fully refundable and I will take the car back on my cost. I'm sure it won't be the case because it's a state of art looking and working machine. Anyway, you will have 7 days from the time you receive the car to inspect it and decide if you want to keep it or not.

20090128174231AAIDcJZ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is wrong with my car? ?	I drive a '98 VW Jetta and every time it rains or snows, my car would stall while I'm driving. I had the worst experience today though. My car stalled 5 times in 2 hours and even after jumping the car, it would stall after 5 seconds or so. Now I need my car everyday for school and work and can't really keep it in the shop for a day or more.       I talked to a few of my friends and they think it's the alternator but it's not because if it was the alternator, my car would stall no matter what weather it is but it only stalls when it's wet out. Does anybody know what the problem may be and how long it would take to fix and how much it would cost?       Personally, I think it's the wires near the battery that may be causing it. Whenever it rains, my car is bound to get stalled, so I'm thinking the water messes up the wire a little bit but I'm not sure. PLEASE HELP!!!

20090128175919AAmcNRC	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	Is the Honda Fit a Wagon or Subcompact Car?	I am wondering which car is smaller? If I buy the Fit I don't want to be driving what is known as a "Station Wagon", like what Grandma's drive. The 5 Door Toyota Yaris liftback is known as a "Subcompact Car", in that it's smaller than a Compact car. But the 2009 Honda Fit is looks similar in size to the 5 Door Toyota Yaris. I always thought the 2009 Honda Fit was a "Subcompact Car". Is the 2009 Honda Fit a "Wagon"? Or is it a "Subcompact car"? My Aim is to purchase the smallest car I can buy from either Toyota or Honda.

20090128180933AAuWXBc	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Blue rem wire on amp?	ok ive pretty much asked alot of questions before. but im running a stock system, and tapping the rear speakers with a line out converter. everything is figured out except the blue rem wire that turns on the amp. i know you can tap into the fuse accessory of the car, but i looked at the fuse panel, and its wired in with the main computer, and so help me god i aint touching it. so what i figured is, what if i ran the rem wire directly from the battery, to a lil switch inside the cabin, then continued into the amp, that way i control if it makes connection. its basicly a one way switch, one side in, one side out, making one connection with no other polarity. and since the amp is grounded and running two [30] fuses, and the main positive red wire for the amp is fused as well, i dont see how it could cause any harm as long as i remember to shut it off when im done using it. would this work? considering i think a car battery only puts out around 12v of charge, same as any head unit or accessory wire.

20090128180824AAMQB3p	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	I got rear ended.  Neither of us had insurance.  If I take her to small claims, will I get in trouble as well?	Basically, she rear-ended me on the free way.  She failed to provide insurance and the car she was driving did not belong to her.  I got her information and held off until after Christmas to call her about it and all, but when I began to call her she began to dodge me.  I decided that I have to take her to small claims court, but I am hesitant because I also don't have insurance (I was driving out of emergency).  I am wondering if I take her to court, will I be penalized for driving without insurance or anything of that nature?  Thanks a lot, any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Hello,   I've been doing my lessons through my parent taught driver's ed system via a approved website. I also have to fill out a paper that has a log that notes the lesson number and date it was finished that I need to turn in on the day I turned in my license. I was just wondering, do the people at the DMV know the exact dates you did the lesson and can they look it up. Because I did the first half before I got my permit and I just finished the rest up now. The problem is I have to go get my license in about a month, and I am not sure if they will accept that on the log.   Thanks
