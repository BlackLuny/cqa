rpLwSzqdaa	Cellular providers generally "lock" the phones that are exclusive to their network to prevent their customers from using them on other networks.  Just for informational purposes...you type in the "unlock" code on the phone you want, and that phone is now capable of working on any providers towers.  Here's the tricky part.  You have to find out the unlock code for the particular model phone you have.  You could try getting it from your provider's customer service, but you'll probably be unsucessful.    You also have to consider what type of network the phone is based on(for example, you wouldn't be able to use a GSM based phone on a CDMA network).    Now to answer your question...No you wouldn't have to pay for an activation...if your phone uses a sim card.  if not, you still may not have to pay an activation.  i guess it depends on the provider.|`|e4hMIUGCaa	Yes,your idea is coming true.The sim card will work on any unlocked phone that exact your phone before.  . Lock phone will just effect the phone not the sim card.The phone will not work if other provider simcard is inserted,it will still work even if it is inserted another number from the SAME provider.|`|pxPcioiLaa	uhm I think its like you can put in any SIM card from any network and itll work.

boh5rCNlaa	its never over 4 days. something is wrong and you need to resolve it or they will charge you the full price for the unreturned phone because they assume you got the new one and decided to keep the old one. call them asap.. 1888 881 2622|`|TtPPLpQKaa	it takes a really long time im not sure exactly tho
5x9EbHWlaa	go to your phone store and ask them for help.|`|2GI5RLaQaa	check to see if you have water or liquid damage...also if u leave ur phone on the charger over night it will cause it fo be frozen or fry it and u loose all of ur memory and info...taking it in the bathroom will also cause it to malfunction ...downloading stuff on it too. getting a bad text message is a problem too...if u can take ur battery out and spin it on a flat surface it is over charged and u killed ur crystals which holds the power in the phone.... that is part of what makes it freeze... e mail me if u need more info....hope this helps
KhGkc2QGaa	A great way to get free music is to go to your local library. It may sound weird, but the library actually has tons of awesome CDs. and it's all free. Getting music from the library is really unknown, but also really helpful. if your library has a website, you can search for CDs and artists. You can then request the CD and the library will call you when it's in. It's completely free and much easier than having to sit there and wait for songs to download.|`|b1175d4d889f29087cceea9d76b4eccfaa	there's no way to get free music legally unless the artist gives it to you legally [meaning that the artist will most likely not be very famous..]  you CAN download utorrent it's a really good program to download anything you want. i used to have limewire but it doesn't work as well..  unless you're in college, then you wont have any legal problems  and even if you are in college, i know 3 people who used utorrent to download things and got caught in college, but the biggest consequence they received was a warning   so you really have nothing to lose..  music isn't meant to cost money anyway.. :)        and Nikki:  downloading music takes no more than a minute a song, usually less than 30 seconds  i download files of 1000 songs in less than 10 minutes  so sorry, but i think downloading IS faster than going to your library, requesting a CD to get to your library, waiting days for it to arrive, driving to the library, checking out the CD, downloading the music from the CD onto your ipod, and returning the CD back...|`|NknzAWPtaa	well, there's no way you can get free music LEGALLY. there's limewire, but i'm pretty sure it's illegal|`|ozmRtpMyaa	There is no way to get free music legally... obviously.  What are you stupid?  Artists need to make money and there are all the copyright issues thats why its not free.  You can get it illegally through Limewire, Acquisition, and many other programs.  Beware though becomes some have viruses.|`|I15chbBhaa	google Free Music
I8yV5Hglaa	First of all, make sure you have the latest version of iTunes.  http://apple.com/itunes/download
AA12116276	Not quite sure I get what you mean--is it your computer that doesn't recognize these cds/dvds, or is it just the Zune software? And are you talking about cds/dvds with music saved as data files rather than audio files?     If the latter, I would think that your computer could recognize them if that is the same computer you burned those files onto cds/dvds with. You might need to try just opening up "my computer" and clicking on the cd-rom drive, and just copy/paste files you want on your Zune onto your hard drive. Then add them to the Zune software so you can sync with the Zune. Zune software only recognizes audio cds, from my knowledge, but that doesn't mean your computer only recognizes those.|`|XRgmpvweaa	Zune only supports WMV video; here is a step by step guide about converting DVD, Videos, and Youtube videos to Zune video  http://www.freedvdripper.org/dvdvideogui...

elqkReHuaa	fyi, you can't use the balance board on carpet, if you want an accurate measurement, that is|`|jALife8Faa	Along with the carpet (Although mine was accurate on our carpet) Your old scale may need to be calibrated.- Non digital scales will go off balance quite often the more they are used- which won't give you an accurate reading either!

c6f3d406377666d7a74f6d3310c54becaa	Hello,    It most likely will not work since the phone is locked in to the SIM it was originally activated with. Provided you get Nextel to unlock the phone for you, only the walkie talkie section of the phone will work. You will not be able to make regular calls or use any of the messaging services.  Cellular calls, data services, (i.e., messaging and Internet) and GPS functions operate on the Sprint CDMA network. Walkie talkie, Group Walkie-Talkie, Talkgroup and Direct Send functions operate on the Nextel iDEN network which uses the SIM.    Hope this helps|`|MLHNSeFIaa	1

fdlhUxzRaa	There is no concrete release date for the G2 device, and no there will not be a specific discount for people who already have the G1 device. Your phone discount availability is based upon the time lapse between upgrade discounts. When you make a phone purchase with a 24 month (2 year contract) in order to qualify for a FULL discount for your next upgrade you will need to complete 22 months of your 24 month contract. In some instances customers are allowed to upgrade a couple months earlier but that is based on your account history, (timely payments, suspensions, and account tenure are all factored into that decision)

qWicVoU9aa	If your contract ends in August and you do not want to upgrade at that time then you do not lose it, you can use it at any point in time that you are ready after that.  As far as doing it early you must be 21 months in to a 24 month contract so again, if your contract is up in August, then you would be eligible for an early upgrade (but maybe not the full upgrade price) in May.  You can log in to your account at www.wireless.att.com and check your eligibility for upgrade there or you can acll customer service at 1-800-331-0500 or 611 from your cell phone|`|i8SkPj8qaa	Usually you have to pay full price for a phone when its not time.

XftrLFiwaa	http://www.myventones.com      VENTONES    is the best free site, you can     1) make your own ringtones for free from MP3 files (which you can get from limewire)  or from YOUTUBE videos. Just give them any youtube video and they will  convert it into a ringtone. very cool     or     2) follow these steps and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    -step 3-  Next open the Ventones site in a new browser window but leave the first   one open as well. Search for the ringtone that you want   (from their free ringtone page ) and click on it.   That will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will NOT have a send to phone button    -step 4-  now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and  click on the send to phone button.    It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd ventones window.   Sounds complex but it works every time for me|`|6pTlTyvMaa	http://www.createringtones.net    its definately the best site for ringtone creations. I've been recommending it for over 3 years.   You can make ringtones for FREE from your own mp3 files. you can even make free ringtones from any youtube video

They might not have the parts to fix it. I would be able to fix it for you for a small charge, but you'll probably have to send it to me. Or, you can buy the parts on eBay and do it yourself.     It's a lot cheaper than buying a new phone plus, it's really hard to navigate your phone without it. Goodluck. Hope this helps.

XftrLFiwaa	the first thing you need to do is send the word STOP   to thumbplay to cancel the subscription      Its a well known fact that Alltel is notorious for crippling their phones and you cannot use mp3 files in your memory card as ringtones or download FREE ringtones  .   They do that to make more money or to force users to pay for their monthly internet plan.   There is ONLY one way and ONE site that works for alltel     http://www.ventones.com      they will text you a link and then your phone will download and install it. I promise it works because I own a scoop and a glimmer and it works awesome!      on ventones you can upload and make your own ringtones, for FREE from either      1) mp3 files  or   2) youtube videos      or     follow these steps and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link.

AA10944402	No- it depends on the the storage capacity of the player-also the higher the speed that the music file was downloaded at the more storage space you use.|`|IgI2SNolaa	1GB isn't that many i'd say go for two if your a music lover.. 1GB is apx. 50-100 songs depending of lengths of songs. i had a 4GB and it held plenty.    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=wSO9jTPFbW...|`|EelOiVf0aa	Well the more expensive the mp3 the more gb they usually have, Hence, they shall hold more songs. I dunno what 1gb stores, but I know 2gb stores 500 songs, as long as they're three minutes long. You'd be surprised how fast you use up memory. If you get one with even more gbs you can put films and everything on your mp3.  I wouldn't go for 1gb.|`|x6hfvTX2aa	It really is were u buy your MP3. One place you may buy a 1G MP3 for $40.00 and in another for $60.00.|`|zztpXebdaa	well it all depends on what amount of memory they have..... let's say you go and buy a 8 GB ipod (2000 songs) for about $150 and you can go and buy a 8GB mp3 for about um, well idk maybe $50..... you can do that, it depends on if you WANT an ipod or just something you can listen to...... oh and most of the time now all the mp3 players (the cheaper ones) are like 2GB or less......|`|qaeGzDgYaa	yes, they hold the exact same amount...  8gb-2000 songs  4gb-1000 songs  1gb-250 songs  the price rises as the features and quality goes up|`|t65BPYbWaa	Every one's correct that a 1gb player holds the same whether it's cheap or expensive.  Depends on format and quality you use how much memory a song takes up. That's why some people get fewer songs on.  1gb should be able to hold about 800 three minute songs in WMA format.  WMA files are smaller than MP3 files, yet sound much better.    In Windows media player, set the bit rate to variable on the lowest quality/smallest size setting. IMHO, the higher quality settings sound no better.    Not really what you asked, but thought it might be helpful.|`|tsoc9tihaa	if they are both 1gb  they should hold exactly the same.    the bigger the number  the more they will hold.    you pay more for ones than others because of the make.

APwQrGYJaa	i dont think the iphone can recieve picture text my dads cant|`|AA11783467	Ringtones for iPhone can be purchased in the iTunes store ($1.98; $.99 for the song, $.99 to make a ringtone) OR you can subscribe to a free ringtone podcast -- the ringtones on those aren't usually songs, but they're sometimes better ringtones than the defaults.    It's true, you cannot send or receive multimedia texts (pictures or video), only text. You also cannot forward text messages. But emailing works for pictures.|`|7uSNsqSsaa	ventones.com    It's works, and is 100% free.|`|MTHLykgTaa	I have an iphone as well and those things really irritate me.  iPhones cannot send or receive picture messages right now. There are a few applications that can help with sending picture messages but they dont really work very well.  You cannot download ring tones directly from the phone like you could with other phones. But use this website to download ring tones. If safe and free. I use it all the time, just create an account and follow the instructions. Its really easy!   http://www.myxer.com/

Some people would say "how do you know this you haven't played it yet".  I would tell them that not only have I seen it on my tv when shows show footage fullscreen but I have also played Gyrostar which uses the same graphics engine and I am 100% sure those are PS3 quality.  Madworld looks good too because the violence is so over the top that it is hilarious so it could control horribly but as log as yo can pull of a hilarious move it will be worth the buy.|`|gBkBZNJOaa	definitely the conduit.  guitar hero metallica  i hated the first FFCC and my life as a king was alright. I'll probly get this one too just to complete my collection of FFCC games and it can't be that bad if it has turn based gameplay (i'm not even sure if it has turn based gameplay but thats what it looked like from the screenshot)|`|tzFkYLGqaa	The Conduit  Madworld(Weird Graphics)  FFCC:Echoes of time    I look forward to play The Conduit with you if you get it!|`|o8NVWaJgaa	I'm looking forward to:  The Conduit  Madworld  Punch Out Wii  Pikmin 3  Sonic and the Black Knight  Wii Sports Resort  Deadly Creatures  and if they're making a new Starfox then that too since I want to hear DO A BARREL ROLL again.|`|FJ5rWfdKaa	dead rising is coming to the wii.

That should shut up the Wii haters who think that the Wii only has "kiddie" games.    The Conduit should also be good.  I know that the Wii port of Dead Rising will have some limitations, but hopefully they fixed the low-def text bug that the 360 version suffered.    Punch out! Wii is going to be wicked fun.  Super Punch Out! remains one of my very favorite 16-bit era games, and it has needed a good sequel to carry on the tradition.    My girlfriend loves rail shooters, almost as much as fighting games, so HOTD should be right up her alley.  We beat HOTD4 in the arcades together.    The FFCC series is OK, but Squeenix needs to realize that the Wii has outsold the 360 and the PS3 combined, and that the Wii has more than enough power to drive a full-blown FF main line title.  And that Wii fans want an good RPG, not just an action-RPG like the FFCC games.

AT&T 3G (fast internet): At&t has been proven over and over again that it has the BEST and FASTEST internet. Trust me on this.    ^^^ Most of the people above me are right. Go with AT&T.

They launched in Canada a few years back and they accept credit cards.  It is a monthly service that costs $12 for the basic plan, which gives you 30 song downloads per month. That comes to about 40 cents per song. It's a month to month service with no contract so you can download the songs you want and then cancel at any time.    Read more about emusic here:    http://www.musicdownloadreview.net    The best part is, they don't limit how you can use song downloads. You can burn to cd, put on an mp3 player, listen on as many computers as you want.
qWicVoU9aa	Look for something called a repeater.  I am told that Radio Shack sells them but I don't know how much they run.  The call center I work in did not have service for the first 2 years I worked there until they put a repeater on the roof and then we all had full bars and they now work great.  Anywhere in the building, which is pretty amazing because it is a metal building

So even if you don't go all the way up to the 400 text messages, they are still going to charge you for the amount of your plan. If you go overboard and text, let's say 500 instead of 400, they will charge you, let's say, 30 dollars instead of 20 dollars for your monthly bill. (Those were just examples) They will charge you like 5 cents extra every time you go over your text messaging limit.     Hope I helped and remember don't go overboard! :-)
KKuzo9Gaaa	Many if my friends and cousins have the phone and I don't think that anyone of them has had it come with a stylus, every time I see them use it they always use their finger to navigate around. If you feel like you are probably not going to need and you think that it is a waste of time to try to keep up with it, then just simply throw it away.     Also I want to know what service you have Sprint or AT&T    There maybe a place to put it, I'm not saying you're lying, I'm just saying that sometimes people overlook things.    And I also don't know why it came with a stylus, because usually styluses only come with smart phones and I don't think that the Instinct is a smart phone. But maybe I could be totally wrong.     But seriously, if there is surely no place to put it...throw it away! :-)|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	i dunno that is weird
Awy82nOfaa	i dont think you can, but there is a trick     you can     1) make your own ringtones for free from music files, or youtube videos    or     2) follow these steps (trick) and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    -step 3-  Next open the Ventones site in a new browser window but leave the first   one open as well. Search for the ringtone that you want   (from their free ringtone page ) and click on it.   That will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will NOT have a send to phone button    -step 4-  now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and click on the send to phone button.    It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd ventones window.   Sounds complex but it works every time for me

If you're lucky enough to find one, I suggest Gamestop or Target.|`|0JV3tQm8aa	ebay is the best place to get wii for cheap    Thanks|`|C7rV71Cjaa	IF you find a Wii at a Circuit City it should be 10% off seeing as all game consoles at Circuit City are 10% off. But 10% off $250 is only 25 dollars off which isn't much and you will also have to pay tax. Also all sales are final, which means if it doesn't work or is missing something you can't return it or exchange it.|`|9rvaMQ0eaa	its still the same.

If nolt, maybe it would be easier to understand...    http://us.wii.com/connect/    In any case, I don't htink you need to "log into the router using teh defaut IP" at all. I'll write down a guide for you here:    1. Click the Wii options button in the bottom left corner on your starting screen    2. Choose wii settings    3. Scroll to page 2 using the arrow on the right    4.Click internet    5.Choose connection settings    6. Click on connection 1, 2 or 3    7. Choose wireless connection (Or wired if you're using a LAN adapter)    8. Click "search for an access points"    9. Click OK    10. Choose the from the connections your Wii has found (Look for your connection. You might have to provide some sort of password)    If all goes well, you'll have to click OK a couple more times, wait for it to test the connection, then the Wii will reset itself and then you'll have internet!    Good luck!|`|E0oPgSyEaa	usually you will have an ip address somewhere around the router, usually in the bottom. type it and you will be able to configure your settings. or go to the manufacturers web, they should have a manual or tutorial. some have a page like www.routerlogin.net or something.
bYlEqiKVaa	Is this a 13.3 inch white macbook, not macbook pro or macbook air?    I had this problem too.  It used to work, I used to be able to insert blank dvds and burn to them via iDvd, but then when I installed some of the standard updates, it changed the firmware settings on my cd/dvd drive, and no longer allowed me insert blank dvds.  So strange, and frankly I still haven't found a solution to it.    I told the Mac guys about it and they thought I was crazy or insisted that the dvd drive never burned dvd's to begin with.  This certainly wouldn't explain tangible evidence in the form of the dozen or so dvd's I've burned from iDVD and turned in as school projects, but they still offered no insight, nor do I think they cared.  :(  We may be up shipoopy creek without a paddle.|`|0hW74c7Baa	Hmm, not sure.

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	There are two very different ways to clean a DVD.  One is to buy a pack of the 'wipes' and rub one in circles around and outward to clean a DVD.  If the DVD is seriously dirty, though, or your player is the cause, then you'll need to buy a 'DVD cleaning disk' that takes about 5-10 minutes to run completely.  This cleans all of the dust out of the player and cleans the 'laser' that reads the disks ... usually it's the player that is truly dirty, not the disk, but if I was you I'd get both (you may buy them in most stores that sell DVDs or CDs ... ask at the desk and they'll show you where they are kept).  Happy cleaning, and I hope your disks play better in the future!

mJF8MsbFaa	You need a satellite meter which can go from $100-450 for a good one, especially if you are trying to get hi-definition. The directv Hi- Definition dishes are the most difficult satellite dishes to installs, standard DTV dishes are easy. If you need help, you can find a local, independent Direct TV installer here: http://www.sathookup.com/satellite-netwo...    They charge between $70-100 depending on your roof and are well worth it.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	well, no you don't really need any special tools, but basic tools are a must. and to be real honest with you, if you follow the directions that come with the unit, the install is pretty routine. do you have a compass, a level...you'll need those to get started w/the alignment. find the side of the house it has to go on, this you'll find in the instructions and mount securely to the location. you will have to have another person to help w this or be able to see the tv during the set-up procedure, from there you just follow  the alignment according to which direction it tells youto move the dish. it's not really too hard but consider starting early so you have enough time to get it done. if you need to e/m me, maybe i can be of further help. just follow the instructions, they're pretty cut and dry. question, did the company not offer you the free install w/the package?|`|0ghnWsWGaa	Obviously start by assembling your dish 7/16 or 1/2" wrench's will do the trick..  Make sure you set the Azimuth and Tilt according to your location.  Usually found in the manual or www.dishpointer.com  Find open sky pointing directly south we'll move west a little from there.  Mount the mounting pole and make sure it is plumb level.  Use 5/8"x 4" lag bolts for mounting the pole.  Now set the dish on the pole pointing directly south.  Have a friend by the TV so you communicate with him/her.  Using the onscreen signal meter slowly start moving the dish to the right until you start picking up signal.  The first set of Satellites should be Directv.  See what kind of signal you have and peak it from there.  Don't forget to tighten everything down when your done or you'll be right back out there trying to find it again.  Should only take a couple hours MAX if this is your first one.  Don't worry if it takes longer though...you'll get it.

51e5b381cf107c548be3810a9ff2f166aa	there are two says to do this.  you can either email/text them to an email address.  or, u can use your usb data cable.  when using the data cable, u must also need activesync on your computer.  when you hook the phone up to your computer, it will ask you if you wish to sync, press cancel, and a small activesync screen will pop up.  from there, click "explore" and it will show you your "my stuff" section of your phone.  from there, you can access your "my pictures" and click and drag or copy and paste them onto your comptuer.  good luck!

It sorta refreshes it so try that.|`|gHcOhc10aa	You have to hold the menu and the center button down for 10 sec!|`|CzaEFJQdaa	this happened to mine to ..      its not broke.. just hold the menu button and the centre button both at the same time.     wait until the apple icon pops up , let go and the main menu screen will appear.    Hope it works !|`|8emZGhy3aa	Nope, its not broken! First, make sure its not just in the hold position, thats an easy mistake to make!     Otherwise, here's two simple fixes in order of easiest to hardest. (They're both very simple though!)    1) Find the "Hold Switch" on the ipod. While the iPod is on, swich it back and forth 4 times, leaving it in the "Hold Off" (White) position. Right after doing that, hold down the menu and middle button at the same time. Keep them held down until The apple symbol appears (the screen will darken). Then, let it restart, and it should be fixed!      2) Try plugging it into your computer and loading iTunes. This may also re-fresh the iPod into restarting.

AA10053514	Any Bluetooth headset would work They are all pretty much the same|`|AA12169898	All bluetooth headsets have basically the same audio quality.. it's all a preference on how you want to wear it and when you'll be using it..     if your going to use it all day I would recommend the Motorola HS605 or the Jabta bt500 those styles hug behind the ear for a more secure fit.     Some of the new Stylish ones would be the Jabra JX10 that one looks real classy(expensive too)     The Motorola H300 is operated by a Triple A battery, is has the most talk time & stand by time than any headset(30hrs talk 30days stand by) I found its good for the person who will just use it once in a while.Although I've heard the battery can be heavy on the ear Energizer makes these super light weight batteries now.    I personally like the Plantronics Discovery 640. Its got custom eargels to fit inside the ear check out www.yesofcourse.com they have a good sale right now.. it comes with more pieces than youll actually use(like an adapter for the charger so you can use you Nokia(single pin)/Sonyerickson(lrg.2prong port)/motorola(small 2 prong port) I've listed a link to the one that i'm using..     also call those guys at the website they will answer all your questions.. Hope I gave you enough info to start with...  (oh yeah just remembered stay away from generic brands 'cause usually there warranty or return policy sucks)     Source(s):    http://www.yesofcourse.com/index.asp?pag...    (Treo makes a headset that says Treo on it, but it's really made by Jabra.)    when you finally get your earpiece for troubleshooting call 888 moto blu (motorola tech support for bluetooth) good luck

cf6d115f72dcdbe2118a709fc123286faa	I  do have an N91 your screen maybe freezing because you've got too mant things open, if you press and hold your menu key on the side of the N91 a different menu will pop up on your screen showing everything you've got open and if you select one you'll be able to stop your screen from opening. Mine works fine if i've only got my music & standby open. But I will admit nokia N91 is a bugger for freezing when using too much i.e trying to delete a song and reading a text at the same time. As for the playing music thing have you still got the main screen with contacts,log, profiles, gallery, music and web on? If you have you maybe pressing buttons when it's in your pocket if your keys are also unlocked.

The Ipod is extremely cool looking and iPod's navigation is the best (the clickwheel, literally the best). But Ipod Nano is not durable. You can break it easily with only 1 drop (happened in the height of 1 foot to hard ground). Ipod's audio quality isn't the best either. Sony has the best audio quality, but you can't really tell if u're a first timer. My advice is to get the ZenV from Creative. Much cheaper, the audio quality is much better, about the same size, also display pictures. But it doesn't have a lot of accessories, isn't as new and cool-looking as the new Ipods. If money and music is important to you, get the ZenV.|`|AA10960806	I have the new Nano, holds 500 songs for $150 dollars, and I think it's great!|`|f3de2abf8efbc1bab78ab950c86227b2aa	By no means.

Of course, if you are referring to an existing installation, it could very well predate the new code and do nothing of the sort, just simply recirculate the same old air over and over again.  A competent inspection of your equipment will reveal exactly what you have and what options are available to you as well.|`|AA11892957	They circulate the air, and also dry it out.

You can also have access to more vehicles other than a warthog on Halo.    Halo has only 16 player online and doesnt even support HD graphics. Can't even reach 720P.

1b342eaf206eb4edecb57c5dfad1a94baa	When I was looking into this, I think I recall the Sennheisers were lighter and less expensive than the Bose equivalents, but still of decent quality.  The Bose headphones have a lot of mark-up due to their aggressive advertising and marketing.  Sennheisers don't seem to suffer from this mark-up.    As for being loud to people around you, it's probably a function of how much acoustic 'cup' exists.  The Bose has a huge cup, the smaller Sennheisers don't...they resemble more like the traditional walkman style headphones than the Bose.    http://www.sennheiserusa.com/newsite/cat...|`|eWbts846aa	If you want headphones that are sound cancelling but not capable of being heard to the people around you I'd suggest Philips earplugs. They aren't headphones (headphones go around your head) you just plug them in your ears. They were only like $15 and come with a case and everything. I got mine from Wal-Mart they come in black or white.|`|AA10368751	I bought a $20 creative labs sound canceling head phone.

BMConIedaa	SA is actually completely wrong.  The DS has outsold the PSP by over 2-to-1.  Developers are much more likely to give more attention to the DS as the potential market is literally over twice as big as the PSP's.  Last year, in the US, the DS outsold the PSP by about 3-to-1 (12 million DSs, compared to only 4.3 million PSPs).    Don't believe me?  VGChartz tracks console hardware and software sales worldwide.  http://www.vgchartz.com    If you ask me, the DS has a more, better games.  You can also surf the web with it.    The DS has updated ports of Final Fantasy 3, Final Fantasy 4, Chrono Trigger.  The PSP does not.    Electroplankton and Jam Sessions aren't so much games, as they basically turn the DS into a musical instrument.  They are also a lot of fun.    Mario Kart DS is one of the best selling online handheld games of all time.  The DS does online gaming very well, so people citing online play as a PSP's strength are very misinformed about the DS's capabilities.    And using a touchscreen as a mouse makes FPS games a lot more enjoyable.  Just try Metroid Prime: Hunters, and you'll agree.    The Castlevania games are great.  They all follow in the tradition that Castlevania: Symphony of the Night started - the Metroid-vania style of crawling through a huge castle with dungeons, arenas, towers... wicked fun.    I have about 20 games for my DS, and I play it very frequently.|`|WAGpAh8oaa	psp. you can play online better graphics you can surf the web more people have them and they ROCK|`|brvOa9QYaa	I only have a ds which is great but the psp, has more uses, u can go online with it and listen to music and stuff. also i think the graphics are better.

w4I9oj2Maa	Ok, ONCE you replaced your weak batteries, DID YOU REPROGRAM THEM PROPERLY?    I know you said you reprogrammed them, but sometimes we forget the proper steps or codes; and that can be the ONLY REAL REASON BOTH DON'T WORK properly.    If it was only one unit, I'd be looking at the possibility of a defective remote or box, but IT DOES operate the Box since it changes channels !  That means it transmits and recieves the signals...    Sooo, the only thing left is the programming of the remote to operate the TV set.  Get out your instruction book, get the codes, follow the instructions on programming your remote and you should be back in business...

However, you also need a computer and S-Video RCA Cables, (Red/Yellow/White cables), which shouldn't be too much of a problem, since you already have them. But if you don't have a computer nearby, you'll need to get one, and THAT will set your $50 limit to about $350.

AA10309280	The person above me is wrong.  You can't change the network of a Verizon phone seeing as though Verizon is CDMA (doesn't use sim cards). Now for instance if you had a phone from Cingular and wanted to change it to T-Mobile then it would be possible since both carriers use GSM (phones that use sim cards), after you unlock the phone of course.|`|4f8089d782c825a3b13b55cd19f9ed6eaa	its possible but you would have to talk to the metro pcs people. i used a cingular phone for t-mobile service before, you just have to buy a new sim card from metro pcs, remove the existing one in your razr, and put the new metro pcs one in. check their website though, i thought i heard metro pcs is pretty tough about letting people use their own cell phones. they want to get more business by having you buy theirs.

You better be careful when leaving them. They will set you up for additional charges or high cancellation fees. The best thing to do when leaving them is to cancel your account on the last day of your billing cycle and tell them to write your numbers down on a piece of paper, roll it up and stick them. Porting their numbers to another service provider takes the longest in the industry. The FCC says it should take from to 2 - 3 hours to port numbers. It takes nextel/sprint one to two weeks. It is a simple process of someone entering those number into a computer and sending them to the other providers service number. I guess they use the same computers that drop so many calls and they use the one person that answers calls for questions like you are asking. Thats right one person.
b805d94b05e1b270428a417077e85476aa	Very subjective question. However if you check with Consumer Reports, the Wall street journal and the JD Power & Associates, you can see that Verizon has been rated in the top for the past 6 years straight. That comes at a price however, as Verizon is the most expensive carrier. The answer above is an awesome option with the Sprint SERO plan. I just dont know your tolerance for dropped calls and Indian based customer service. The most ports from other carriers I get is from Sprint to Verizon. Go try out everyone for yourself, they all have a 15 day trial period.|`|685ed4af8867fe554f1983939d72f575aa	Either Sprint or Verizon. I've had many carriers and Sprint and Verizon were my favorites. Sprint has great rates, especially for data. Verizon has great customer care and coverage (for voice, Sprint has better data coverage, however you can roam so its not a big deal) If you get Sprint, you should get a PDA phone. Unlimited data (Internet and Email) is only $15 per month on top of your voice plan. And if you know a Sprint employee, you can get the SERO plan. (SERO = Sprint Employee Referral Offer) You get 500 anytime minutes N&W starting @ 7 PM, Unlimited data, and free IM for only $30 per month!!!! Thats only available if you know a Sprint employee. Go to http://www.sprint.com/sero/ and enter the employee's email address and you get a discounted price on devices, too! Verizon doesn't really have great rates and their phones all have the same UI. Sprint is really a great choice and if all my family didn't have Verizon, I'd still have a Treo on Sprint. Right now I have a KRZR on Verizon, but im gonna get the Samsung U620 phone when it comes out. First VZW phone with Mobile TV Serive thru  MediaFLO!!!|`|AA10333764	Verizon, Because it's the only one that works where I live.|`|fa1991ccc0724f65408c0300b6378380aa	Alltel or verizon I have both and they run off of each others towers, there is very few places that i don't have service i am really happy with both.

2aa6585421c0e48790f21a9e08f64433aa	FILE SHARING  File sharing is the practice of making files available for other users to download over the Internet and smaller networks. Usually file sharing follows the peer-to-peer (P2P) model, where the files are stored on and served by personal computers of the users. Most people who engage in file sharing are also downloading files that other users share. Sometimes these two activities are linked together. P2P file sharing is distinct from file trading in that downloading files from a P2P network does not require uploading, although some networks either provide incentives for uploading such as credits or force the sharing of files being currently downloaded.    COPYRIGHT ISSUES  File sharing (such as with the Gnutella and Napster networks) grew in popularity with the proliferation of high speed Internet connections, relatively small file size and high-quality MP3 audio format. Although file sharing is a legal technology with legal uses, many users use it to download copyrighted materials without explicit permission: copyright infringement or "piracy". This has led to attacks against file sharing in general from some copyright owners.    There has been great discussion over perceived and actual legal issues surrounding file sharing. In circumstances where trading partners are in different countries with different legal codes, there are significant problems to contend with. What if a person in Canada wishes to share a piece of source code which, if compiled, has encryption capabilities? In some countries, a citizen may not request or receive such information without special permission.    Throughout the early 2000s, the entire file-sharing community has been in a state of flux. In the year 2000, there was speculation over how seriously record companies and the Recording Industry Association of America would strike the file-sharing community because of its limits compared to more traditional forms of media. However, the communities suffered strain as record companies and the RIAA tried to shut down as much of it as possible. Even though they have forced Napster and Grokster into cooperating against copyright violations, they are fighting an uphill battle since the community has flourished and produced many different clients based on several different underlying protocols. The third generation of P2P protocols, such as Freenet, are not as dependent as Napster is on a central server; and as they encrypt the shared data, it is much harder to shut down these systems through court actions. Another attempt (used by the maintainers of KaZaA) is to change the company's organization or country of origin so that it is impossible or useless to attack it legally. To date, file sharing in Canada is somewhat legal, though not completely so. The uphill battle also extends to the legal actions taken by the RIAA and motion picture counterpart MPAA against individuals using file-sharing programs to distribute material protected by copyright. Ambiguity in the interpretation of copyright law has been a major factor contributing the lack of successful enforcement by the Intellectual Property owners. In Electra v. Perez for example, the Court ruled that the act of making such files available for distribution equated to infringement of the works involved. In the more recent UMG v. Lindor, Judge David G. Trager ruled that the RIAA would be required to prove that actual distribution (sharing) occurred. Should this case go to trial in 2007, it will likely set a precedent for further RIAA and MPAA actions.    The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported group which seeks to protect and expand digital rights. Its activities include litigation, political lobbying, and public awareness campaigns. The EFF has vocally opposed the RIAA in its pursuit of lawsuits against users of file sharing applications and supported defendants in these cases. The foundation promotes the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing of copyrighted materials and alternative methods to provide compensation to copyright holders    ______________________________________...

heu43dafaa	Although they are both high definition discs and output to 1080p they are totally different video formats and technologically different. You can only play Blu-Ray discs and regular DVDs on your PS3.    Kinda sucks cuz certain movie studios only support on particular format.  So you may find one movie on HD-DVD and not on Blu-Ray.|`|AA10368751	You can't play HD-DVD on Bluray.  The reason being, it's industry conspiracy.  I'm sure some one can come up with a player that plays both and it'll happen in near future, but for now you just can't.  If you want to get in detail of why it's incompatible, I have to talk a little bit of physics.  To pack data on the disc, either you layer it so that you have more space to write on or you can shrink the laser to that it can write more on to existing space.    Original CD held about 650mb then it grew to 800mb by using the CD to the outer edges.    Then came DVD, DVD used smaller "pit" than CD and it used the space more efficienly to give about 4x the storage of CD.  Hence it gave us about 4500mb.  Then came the dual layer DVD to increase the storage to 8700mb.    Now both CD and DVD used the same red laser to do this.    Then came some Japanese guy who found a way to create a   Blue LED light.  Now you might ask, why would it be hard to create a Blue light?  Let's just say that creating a pure Blue light is hard.  I mean pure Blue light doesn't really exist in nature other than our Sun light which composed of all the visible light in spectrum.  You can create red light easy because there are lot of natural element that emits light when charged with energy, i.e. NEON signs.  But no natural element gives off Blue light.  The only way in the past, to artificially create a Blue light would be to produce two different light to mix it together to give off Blue appearance.  With the Blue LED then came the Blue laser.  Which layed the foundation for HD-DVD and BluRay disc.  Both HD-DVD and BluRay uses the Blue laser which smaller wavelength than Red laser.  Smaller wavelength allow us to use even smaller hole to represent the data.  How smaller?  Blue light is about 7x smaller than Red light.  Hence we are able to get 34000mb on BluRay and HD-DVD.  The difference between BluRay and HD-DVD is how the disc is manufactured.  HD-DVD was created such that existing DVD manufacturing facility can add little modification to their existing plant to create HD-DVD.  Meaning HD-DVD is just DVD with material that can be used for Blue Laser.  BluRay on the other hand is totally brand new manufacturing that is suppose to answer/address the problems most DVD is facing.    What DVD problem do you say?  Well, let's face it, HD-DVD and DVD was created out of CD.  CD was designed to work with the older Red laser in mind.  Meaning, the whole medium was created to work well with Red laser.  It wasn't really meant to work with any other wavelength light.    Because Blue light are smaller in wavelength it is more prone to scattering effect cuased by the clear acrylic mold that make up the outer layer of the disc.  If you examine the CD, DVD, HD-DVD, the distance from the outer layer where the laser enter and to the surface of the data hole is relatively large compare to the Blue light wavelength.  Because the distance is large, you will get more scattering effect and more prone to generating error in the long run if the disc surface is damanged or scratched.  The BluRay disc shortens the distance between the clear acrylic outer surface to the data surface to that the laser doesn't have to travel very far to read the data.    So to conclude why you can't play a HD-DVD on a BluRay is that the laser have to know what distance it needs to travel and at what angle it needs to read the data being reflected.    Since HD-DVD and BluRay uses different distance from the outer surface to inner surface, a smart player can adjust to the difference but currently, no one is making it happen due to my origial statement, it's conspiracy.|`|128fc0a5cd75496585da606233449c2aaa	Here is some more info for you     Blu-ray      Industry Support Apple; Dell Inc.; Hewlett Packard Company*; Hitachi, Ltd.; LG Electronics Inc.; Mitsubishi Electric Corporation; Panasonic (Matsushita Electric); Pioneer Corporation; Royal Philips Electronics; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; Sharp Corporation; Sony Corporation; TDK Corporation; Thomson; Twentieth Century Fox; and Walt Disney Pictures and Television, Warner Bros.*    ** The Blu-ray Disc Association  has over 170 members     Studio support Lions Gate, MGM, Paramount, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox, Walt Disney Pictures and Television, (including Walt Disney Home Entertainment, Hollywood Pictures Home Video, Touchstone Home Entertainment, Miramax Home Entertainment, Dimension Home Video and Disney DVD) Warner Bros.

Most of the capture card on the market are Svideo based so you're probably stuck with Svideo digitizer board.  I'm using a fairly cheap board from pinnacle.  Just convert the hi-8's Svideo in to MPEG 2 and burn it with any DVD authoring tool of your choice.    Your second choice is to buy a regular DVD recorder applicance.  These are just like a regular VCR and insert a blank DVD and select the input that is connected to the hi-8 player then hit play on hi-8 and hit record on the DVD recorder.

If they do, there will be a port for it somewhere on the phone, possibly under the battery.  You can just insert your sim card and the phone will work, though you will likely need additional services activated to use all the features of the blackberry.  You don't need to get any activation for features you already pay for through your provider.  You will only need to activate new features.  Any service center can do that for you and you can probably do it over the phone.    Otherwise, you can just insert your sim card into any phone with a port and it will work as your phone.

He used a huge device called a "Tesla coil" (no points for originality) to wirelessly transmit energy through the air. The problem with this is that the losses increase almost exponentially the further you get from the source. The whole system is ridiculously inefficient and it was never considered for serious mass use. The best solution to power without plugs is to carry the power within the device. This can be achieved by the use of batteries or onboard generation. The latter, which is normally used for large scale devices, is now starting to make its way into consumer electronics with concept laptops and cell phones being powered by fuel cells and micro turbines. Both of these solutions are thousands of times more efficient than Mr. Tesla's coil and will most likely be the most predominate form of "wireless energy" in the years to come.|`|YNHNXFcbaa	There are many wireless plugs including a variety of coax plugs which go into a socket.

SMAvsulSaa	I'll assume that you are talking home stereo and not large venue audio.  In that case it really doesn't matter.  In a large bundle of high power speaker cables (think 12 pair of 600 watt lines) you could get some weird induced current with untwisted cable.  With just a few lines together it won't matter.  So if you got some screaming deal on untwisted cable for your home or car speakers, use it.  Stranded cable is necessary, especially on high frequencies.  Search for "skinning effect" to learn more about this issue.|`|r7bmz65eaa	sorry, i don't know anything about that!|`|QekY4ycuaa	I don't think that there is a difference.

A lot of people use satellite because cable may not be available in some rural areas|`|4Pk6VNftaa	"Comcast sports net" is owned by Comcast, and therefore is not available to DirecTV.    However, both DirecTV and DishNetwork have tons of sports packages available so you can watch your local sports team.  You probably just need to add this to your subscription.

ry6vQwwSaa	there arent really any cheats but theres things you can do to make the game different...    in tennis, before you choose the number of sets, the screen goes black...if u hold down the 1 or 2 button, you get to play on a blue court...    in boxing, once you defeat matt (the trainer) and become a pro, if you hold down the 1 or 2 button (sorry cant remember which one it is off the top of my head) you get to fight in solver gloves...you have to be a pro though...    in bowling, you can change the ball by pressing the arrow keys before the game starts...    and in baseball, you press 2 to switch to underhand throws, which makes it more difficult...and then you can still use A/B/A+B etc for the curved ball etc    in golf on one of the levels, there's a small island on the right hand side...if u get the ball there, you can then go straight to the hole from the island, which means you dont have to take the long way around...sorry cant remember the level, havent played it in ages!|`|HwU2ljGXaa	nothin|`|EiSGZfJKaa	yes here are the links|`|6dquMxgmaa	There isn't no cheats.|`|kSyiUxYSaa	You can change the bowling ball color and some other stuff:    http://www.gamespot.com/wii/sports/wiisp...|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Steroids?|`|E9UYjsxeaa	none.|`|WfwlGbUAaa	I don't think you can cheat.

AA11061397	Volume pots? Plural?    I would have thought that one was volume and the other a tone control.    The ear's response to changes in loudness is non-linear.  Put simply this means that a doubling in sound pressure is not perceived as a doubling in volume.    For that reason volume controls always use a logarithmic potentiometer.      The tone control, if it is indeed a tone control, will almost certainly be a linear one.|`|mCi6Hzapaa	plug it in
xiqDzvZLaa	on the wii home page, click the settings button on the bottom left and find the date & time settings option  its very simple|`|BMConIedaa	From the Wii main menu, click the circle in the lower left hand corner - it says "Wii."    Then go into your system settings, and click the Calendar tab.  The Time is in military format, ie 1 PM = 13:00, and 7 PM = 19:00.
fWMat3xwaa	when you schedule recordings, the default is to record to TV2 first, a second show scheduled at the same time then goes to TV1. Now the biggest culprit of your issue is the start early ( 1 min ) and the end late ( 3 min ) option. For example: you want to record show "A" from 8:00 to 9:00, Then show "B" from 9:00 to 10:00. Since show "A" is actually recording till 9:03, show "B" then moves to TV1.  Hope this makes sense. To fix this, go to options while setting up a timer and set early/ late options to 0. It will then ask if you want it for this one timer for for all timers, choose all.
Xxviy63Paa	Sony has never had a fully functional flash player in the XMB. I don't think they downgraded anything in update 2.40. Maybe facebook changed something. Most videos have never worked online on ps3 because it's mostly flash/shockwave and XMB can't handle it.    The new update isn't 2.40, it's 2.6 something. As far as I know, they haven't done much to the video, except they've tried to improve it by making it compatible with the new youtube.com/tv which you can watch in fullscreen, and also hulu.com which works in fullscreen too. They may have changed some settings that affect other sites. Make sure you've got everything enabled too, including Java.    There is no way to make Sony fix the flash player, they just really don't give a rip. It's been more than 2 years and they haven't even fixed the Java plugin, so don't expect them to install a decent flash player any time soon, either. The best solution is to install linux, and then get the greasemonkey add-on for Firefox. This allows you to add user-created scripts that do all kinds of things, including forcing Firefox to view flash player with VLC or mplayer instead of Flash (linux Flash sucks too. It is Adobe's fault). Under OtherOS I can not only view youtube video just as well as the XMB can, I can download it and keep it too. And transcode it into mpeg so I can put it on the regular XMB partition.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Actually, the current update is 2.60. Sony never bought a license from Adobe to use flash player or anything else adobe related.

AeEuNkKZaa	You can't change the transition time.  It just goes from one scene to the next.  It's pretty quick when the files are on your computer but It takes a little bit when streaming the online video because it is switching video streams.  The transition on the DVDs I have ordered is pretty fast.    StashSpace is a basic editor.  It allows you to do cuts and splice videos together with ease, but doesn't have the advanced functionality of more complicated video editing software like iMovie or Adobe Premiere.|`|jfM61TUpaa	,
457100fed3620574b42ee7b208682b1faa	I think that you are asking in relation to cordless phones... In which case, there are NO 6.0Ghz cordless phones... there is however DECT 6.0 phones, which operate in the 1.9Ghz range...     When it comes to radio frequencies, the lower the frequency, the further the range, as long as all other factors remain the same. 900Mhz phones would in theory have the best range, however, they operate at lower transmitting power then other cordless phones.     From best (range, battery life, etc) to worse:    DECT 1.9Ghz - best range, least interference, unlicensed radio spectrum dedicated strictly for cordless telephones.    2.4 Ghz - next best range, however this unlicensed radio spectrum is crowded with wifi, wireless video cameras, and various other wireless consumer devices, and therefore subject to increased interference.     5.8Ghz - unlicensed radio spectrum, not as crowded as 2.4Ghz but also may contain other consumer electronics. range is limited compared to 2.4Ghz and DECT phones.     900Mhz - no security, can be listened in on any radio scanner ("police scanner") unless equipped with DSS. least range of all currently available cordless phones. Many consumer electronics such as baby monitors, and wireless intercom and doorbell systems, and garage door openers operate within this frequency range.     1st Gen cordless phones (aprox 48Mhz) - poorest range, no security, can be listened in on with a radio scanner, also shares unlicensed frequencies with baby monitors. Limited frequencies. No longer commercially available, however some (very few) of these phones are still in use.|`|hxLfYZOVaa	gigahertz is an abbreviation for "cycles per second" in this case   5.8 gighrtz means 5.8 billion cycles per second and refers to speed at which something is done or accomplished.   in digital audio we use hertz to measure the sampling rate of "analog amplitude voltage variations" in order to measure how many times per second the signal is recorded to digital format, withing an analog to digital converter. analog(copy of,)digital(the use of 1' and 0's to store information to a medium). standard audio cd's are recorded at 44.1 kilohertz(44,100 hertz) at 16bit(2to the 16th power=this is total possible of amplitude voltage variations that can be resolved by a digital system.  hertz(cycles per second), kilo=1,000 mega=1,000,000 giga= 1billion, etc.|`|lLGwzChtaa	Daniel has said exactly.

They're both a lot of fun, and a good workout. (I'm not sure how much it costs, though, I bought it quite some time ago)|`|iNojIEt2aa	U need the Wii to play it. Or else, you'd have the game... and nothing to put it in.    The game cost around $95 or so. Depending on the store.    It comes with the game, and the Wii Fit Board.    It's deff worth getting. i have it and i get a good workout from it.|`|jmg7DrZcaa	You have the have the Wii because that is the whole point of the 'Wii' part o.o|`|i0eJb8tZaa	No you need the Wii as well as Wii fit. Wii fit costs AUS$130.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	your question is do you need a wii to play WII fit? wtf, so i don't get reported yes you do, of course you do, my 20 m/o can work that out

oS2F9oPaaa	Where did you hear this?|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Microsoft has repeatedly denied any plans to release a blu-ray drive for the 360.    Unless you have a very recent article refuting this, I'm afraid you've just been listening to exaggerated rumors.    Here's their latest denial, from May of last year:  http://www.engadget.com/2008/05/05/micro...    There hasn't been any mention of this rumor in the past 7 months - including at last year's E3, and CES 2009 which was just last month.    Personally, I don't see a reason to add blu-ray to the 360.  It would raise the price by at least $100-150, it would most likely be an external add-on, like the HD-DVD Drive, and I doubt it would do little, if anything, to improve Microsoft's sales.  Total number of 360s sold worldwide is outpacing the PS3 by a wide margin.  If Microsoft wanted to further spur sales on, they only need drop their price - not release an expensive accessory with limited appeal.    The next Xbox is predicted to have a release date sometime in 2012.  It wouldn't surprise me if this machine came with a blu-ray drive, as the technology will be much cheaper by then.|`|GR9mmWxVaa	too bad people will hate the 360 cause the ps3 has it already and it will cost so much more than the original  plus we do not need another company stealing others ideas 360 already has netflix and stuff and that would be crazy if blu ray comes out for 360|`|S7zdutfOaa	impossible|`|aK9sP4qXaa	NO NO NO NO NO AND NO!!!!! SONY WOULD NEVER EVER AND I MEAN EVER GIVE MS THE RIGHTS TO BLU-RAY! Not even on crack would they give it to them! THEY ARE AT WAR!!!!!!! Sony is winning! :)

4Pk6VNftaa	There are DVRs that come with the new digital tuner in them, and do not require a service agreement.  However, you still need to have a TV source for these - or any - DVRs - be it satellite, cable, or an antenna.    Also, these DVRs don't download a TV schedule, so their functionality is limited to that of an old fashioned VCR.  For each occurence of each TV show you want to watch, you must tell the DVR what channel, day of the week, starting time and duration.    Furthermore, the DVR functions in your DirecTV box will ONLY work with DirecTV - the receivers in the DirecTV box are not compatible with the signals from your antenna or cable.|`|0hW74c7Baa	I believe you can with a TiVo. For 12.99ish or so a month it will have the guide (like the cable boxes do) etc. The DVR will also record 2 shows at once and let you watch a recorded show at the same time (like most cable/sat providers).      I'm not 100% sure about it though, check here  www.tivo.com
tbxBuATwaa	PSP's do not have any built-in memory. Your PSP should have come with at least a 32MB memory card or 1GB if you bought a bundle package. If you don't have one, you can purchase them for fairy cheap now all over the web.    To transfer photos and video, you can either use the USB method as you attempted already, but with the memory card in the PSP. Another way would be to use a memory card reader. Once it's recognized by your computer, there will be separate folders for Music, Photos, Videos, etc. Find the appropriate one and transfer your files over.     The PSP does play MP3 files for audio and MP4 files for video, so you may want to download a program that will allow you to convert your current files if they are not in the correct format. Hope this helps!|`|9AR6B4ELaa	yes you need it. i recommend the memory as big as possible (which is up to 8GB). and i think there's something wrong with your pc|`|0JMOJL3qaa	Oh yes.. deffinently, you need a memory stick to save anything to the psp system.. they are fairly cheap now-a-days, so i'd recomend a 1GB memory card, but thats up to you..       hope this helps!|`|ujAtqJdgaa	yes you do need a memory stick.  you can get a 2gb for around $30 best price  make sure you have connected you psp device to the computer as found in settings.|`|aUDfAMI3aa	yes the disc is the memory card   the psp is preety much a cd drive connected to the computer  mem cards arent cheap though the best one for music and movies would be the 1 gig and that's about $15 at walmart  but can also hold demoes   and games(need CFW)  also if your computer prompts for you to format your memcard do not do it because it will become unuseable|`|pKXmVgRLaa	Yes, you need a memory card.
ZbnVjxQOaa	What is this crap doing in History Questions, why don't you kiddies go outside and play?|`|Xxviy63Paa	Any decent shooter should have gamepad support built in. You just need to have the right driver. If you use an xbox or sony gamepad, the drivers have been around for years, and they work great.    Some pc shooters don't support gamepads though, these are people who haven't yet figured out that not everybody thinks WASD is the most agile way to move your character around, or likes to hunch over a keyboard until their neck is stiff and their hand gets carpal tunnel from clenching the mouse.     If Call of Duty turns out to be like that, you can still get around it by using a keypad emulator. This allows you to assign every gamepad event with the appropriate keystroke. I don't know one that will also emulate the mouse movements with one of the sticks though. I use an emulator called joy2key for games like legends and enemy territory, but it doesn't emulate the mouse so I have to tie the right stick (axes 2 and 3) to turn left/turn right and look down/look up, respectively. This limits how well I can play with the gamepad because it doesn't register as analog; just like pressing a key, it turns at a constant speed. This makes it hard to aim. But it is still easier to strafe and works better than key and mouse in my opinion.    I use ps3 sixaxis for games which has besides the 4 axes, a total of 14 buttons that most pc games can recognize. That's enough to put the keyboard away for most games.
0AUTZt5Aaa	You need a network adapter for PS2. It used to be $40 new, so I suspect you could nab* one off eBay for around $20.        *Metaphorically, of course.|`|iClAIGn2aa	you can't play onlline with the ps2|`|6y2SZDQeaa	you need one of those internet adapters that you stick on the back of your ps2 and you put the internet cord into it since it isnt wireless and yeah lmao that's it.
