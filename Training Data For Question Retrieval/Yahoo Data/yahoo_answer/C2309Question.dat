20090220220236AAmDqbE	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What are my chances of getting into UCSD?	I am in 11th grade so I am starting to look at colleges.  I have a 3.7 GPA (unweighted) and I go to a private college prep school so the coursework is more difficult then at many public schools.  I am in AP Biology, AP Government, and Honors Math III.  I am a student recruiter for my school, I play varsity basketball and volleyball, I am a member of a robotics team at another school, I volunteer at Make A Difference Day twice a year and I am also involved in Special Olympics activities, some of my artwork has awards in art shows, and I play club volleyball where I am the captain.  I took my ACT in August this year and scored a 30.  I plan on taking it again and hopefully get a 32 or better.  I have heard that UCSD is pretty difficult to get into, but it has a great biomedical engineering program so I really want to go there.  Also what are my chances of getting into Michigan or Rice?  Those schools are also great for biomedical engineering.

For my undergrad, I went to a community college and then transferred to a university.      My graduate application is asking me to list all my schools and the units completed.      I did 64 units at my community college and transferred them to my university.      At my university I have done 47, and have total units of 111.      Do I put 111 for my university since the units transferred and that is on my transcript, or do I put 47?      At the bottom it asks for the number of transferable units. Does that mean I put 111 for university, 64 for community college, and 64 under transferable units?

I am in my junior year of high school and I've been looking into Cornell for about two years. I've done much research on this school and have fallen in love with it.I hope to apply to the College of Arts and Sciences (philosophy major).As of now my average is around an 88. I know it's really low, but I'm working very hard on bringing it up.I have over 500 hours of community service.I am on the booster (stepping) team in my school. I dance for a known dance company in my area. I dance 6 hours a week. I was an intern at the district attorney's office of my city (I plan on becoming a lawyer). I go to a highly competitive private school which is why I am only in the top 50% of my class. Do you think this could affect my chances, or will they take into consideration the competition at my school? I am taking private tutoring for the SATs, so hopefully this will help me get a high score when I take the test in May.Next year I will be taking AP Art, AP Psychology, AP English, AP Spanish, and Statistics. I currently take honors Spanish and honors English, and tutor two sophomores in Spanish for school credit. I am a member of the National Honors Society. I plan on attending Cornell Summer College this summer.I know I don't have the best transcript, but I plan on writing an essay portraying my love of learning, which I realize is an important factor that Cornell wants in a student. Please tell me what you think my chances are and if you have any advice to spice up my transcript, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for all your help!

I am a social work major at a local university and I am doing a genogram project for one of my social work classes. A genogram is like a family tree, but contains a lot more information such as those members of your family who suffer/suffered from drug and alchohal abuse, physcial or sexual abuse, and or if they had any serious physcial or mental illnesses. We were asked by our professor to present our genograms to the rest of the class and being that we are talking about very personal information, both my class and our professor took a vow of confidentiality to not release this information to anyone outside the classroom. Upon telling this to my father, we began a very heated discussion on weather or not it is ethicly right to release this very personal information without the consent of those people whom we are talking about even though we all of took vow of confidentiality. He thinks my professor is wrong for having us do this but I say no.

20090220184553AAPd5zk	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	More free time in college or when you have your career?	For those who work, do you have more free time now than you did in college, or is it the other way around?        I'm a committed student who's trying to double major to get a solid degree and graduate with honors. (I'm in Business and English, with some Accounting)   I'm studying everyday, especially on the weekends, so much that there's no way I could squeeze in a job anywhere.  I have not even tasted beer or been to a typical college party since I've been here, and it's almost two years, but I feel that I would be betraying what my family did for me to ensure that I have this opportunity.      People say that college is the last time we'll have the privilege or partying and just kicking back, but I think that I'll have more time when I finally have my career, and I only have to go to work from 8-5 and enjoy free nights and weekends.  Who is right?      Career-wise I just want a decent job that pays well.  In no way do I want to be a partner or executive of some company, so I'm not a "career girl".  I just want to provide for my family and come home and enjoy life, but all the while I understand that my job is intense and that I'll have to give it my all.      So again my question remains: More free time in college or when you have your career?

20090220190116AAeqXyQ	Education & Reference;Homework Help	How is this done? please help. really need help!?	Two station astronauts will need to perform five 6-hour EVAs within 14 days to repair a damaged solar panel that was impacted by a micrometeoroid on the space station. How much oxygen will be needed to accomplish this?       Each EMU has oxygen tanks (similar to scuba diving tanks) that work with a carbon dioxide removal system to allow a 6- to 8.5-hour spacewalk. Without the ability to remove carbon dioxide, the oxygen in the tanks would run out more quickly, because much would be tied up in exhaled gas. The amount of oxygen consumed, and carbon dioxide produced by a crewmember is dependent on his/her metabolic rate. (The life support system holds other things that get consumed during a spacewalk as well, including a battery and cooling water.) The suit contains .54 kilograms of oxygen (at a pressure of 5,860.5kilopascals) for one EVA lasting between 6- and 8.5-hours.      so how much Oxygen is needed?

20090220210154AA0jRKn	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Is this a good story i wrote for english?	she is the type of person that hides her feelings she is that girl that you can never get close to b/c she had a wall up that cant be broken down she has tried to let that wall down before but didn’t succeed because as soon as it came down a little she got a feeling that she had never had before and it hurt it wasn’t the type of feeling that she wanted. She realizes that she has things in her past that she needs to face confront and, they are things that her best friend and mother don’t even know. She puts this wall in front of her to prevent herself from loving someone and getting hurt like she has been hurt before. She has realized that she is afraid to love someone and she doesn’t know how to love someone but yet she wants to be loved and she wants to love. she wants to be close to someone she wants to be in love but she is afraid. If the things that happened to her didn’t happen to her maybe she wouldn’t be this way maybe she could be like other girls. But for now her cant she can just be that girl that prevents herself from being in love hides from her feelings and feel insecure.  She doesn’t know why she keeps her feelings bottle up and hides so many things she wants to just let them all out get them off her chest tell the whole world but she cant… she doesn’t want everyone to know her but she wants to tell someone. she wants to stop crying endless nights and getting sick every time all the memories haunt her, she wants to be normal, she wants him, she wants to fall in love and be happy, she wants to kiss and hug, and fight and love someone unconditionally she wants to be some ones everything, she wants to be the one he wants to be with forever. she always lies and says she is single because she wants to be but she isn’t,  she is single b/c she cant find the courage to tell him how she really feels, she acts like she isn’t human , like her heart doesn’t beat and she has never shed a tear, she keeps her feelings bottled in like she is unhuman and doesn’t have emotions, like she is heartless, she acts hard, like she made of steel ,but she is not, there is this kind caring sweet affectionate girl inside of her that wants to come out she wants to be free and love and care she wants to be happy she wants to tell him how she feels but she didn’t instead she  just let him go by when he could have been the one that could save her, she wants to cry happy tears not sad but she is so afraid that when she comes from behind this wall she will be hurt like she has been since she was a little girl.  But she realizes that she isn’t a little girl anymore and she is a woman now so she wants to come from behind this wall but She doesn’t know how to come out she is trapped ….how does she save herself how does she let herself be free and love and care and be happy and affectionate she doesn’t know… maybe she is trapped still because she is waiting for him… needs him.. for him to come save her and love her and make her feel like she can trust him … maybe he is right in front of her waiting for her to confess to him but she doesn’t know because her wall has kept him from expressing his feelings….  She just wants to love and be loved and trust and be trusted… she wants to feel human again is that to much to ask… some one save me
