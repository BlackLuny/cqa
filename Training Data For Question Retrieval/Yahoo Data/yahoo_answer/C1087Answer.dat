YsX0Q5lnaa	It sounds really lame but if I run out of ideas for what to do with my hair, I google the girls from "The Hills"... they always have cute hair styles, even if that TV show is pointless. Sometimes they're hard to do but if you practice a bit they look cute!    Here's a few of my favorites:  http://justjared.buzznet.com/headlines/2...    http://fashionfeen.files.wordpress.com/2...    http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip0003... (lots of different styles and how-tos)    Hope that helps!|`|aPdKEKyeaa	Well heres what i do overnight and it usually works..  well i wash my hair and then while its still wet i just brush it then make a whole bunch of little braids liike maybe 12 i know it sounds weird but just do it lol. then when you wake up in the morning take all of them down and then ur hair shuld be really curly  hope i helped!
ZsU6EKWPaa	GHD's are good but a little expensive...   Babyliss are a bit cheaper.    As for the mouse etc. i would go for hairspray as it doesnt make your hair look wet and you can just spritz it on after straightning!|`|rlmdQRFYaa	Neither. Mix some gasoline with some frozen concentrated orange juice and let it sit a few days.  Then put the resulting gel in your hair and blow dry it. It will hold all day!|`|yr1685V1aa	get ghd's|`|2kAEw4ynaa	If you want a strong hold gel with almost no flake get ICE SPIKER.|`|Btt44Vtwaa	wax too are gud...even gud for the hair health

Lool x|`|LREo3Tjpaa	I absolutely love headbands! maybe you should wear thick ones with your hair down and then you can pull your hair up with your bangs down and wear skinny ones. Also bows, bow clips or tie a bow in your pony tail. Also you can flat iron your hair and pull your hair up high for a preppy look or wear is low for a casual look.|`|YsX0Q5lnaa	Without going too short or super straight bangs, and with your face shape, I'd go with something like this:  http://www.hairdohairstyles.com/Hairstyl...

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Long layers and leave-in conditioner are pretty much the best thing you can do. I also like to add a gel overtop of that, Herbal Essences Body Envy gel (which doesn't actually increase my volume btw), for added definition.    Here are some hairstyles you can try:  - Half up with a clip or hair tie. I also like putting half up in a bun with bobby pins. (They tend to not get caught on my hair.) I also love these:  http://www.flexi8.com/  - Side parted hair with the front section clipped to the side. I like to use little jaw clips, but bobby pins will work if your hair isn't too thick.  - Flipped through pony tail. Put your hair in a loose pony tail. Reach up under the pony tail and separate the hair there into two sections. Use your other hand to twist the tail and then pull it through from the bottom. You can also do a flipped through half up.  - French ponytail. Put the top section of your hair (above ears) into a ponytail. Next, put the middle into a pony. Then put the bottom into a pony. This looks less kiddy if you do it looser with pretty clips.  - Braids and buns are simple and can disguise bad hair days. http://www.wikihow.com/Braid-Hair  -French braid headband. This works for leaving the hair down or up and is quicker than a real one. http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-French-Bra...  - Invest in some hair sticks--they're really fun for putting up the hair ina bun.    There's also a book out there with hair styles specifically for curls called "Strictly Curls" by Nicole Siri. http://www.strictlycurls.com/    Some great curly care websites:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm    Hope this helps! :)
AA12037013	This works for everyone, I think.    Go to the suppliments section of the pharmacy.    Get a bottle of BIOTIN tablets and take one a day.    Within a month you will see new growth of hair growing in and existing hair healthier.    Stress caused me to have some hair loss. I was advised to do this. IT WORKS!!!!    Oh and biotin is very inexpensive I bought a jar of 100 for under $2.|`|J7RuBjPTaa	I can't see the pic!  I would go see you stylist, they will be able to give you tips such as scalp massages that you can do at home.  I think folic acid is good to thicken hair and encourage healthy growth.|`|vi2bzq0Caa	Purchase these hair vitamins: Hairfinity Hair Vitamins.  Visit this site www.hairfinity.com|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Bad link, so I can't see it.    Everybody's hair is thinner on one side, you know. If your long hair parts or breaks naturally, train it to do that on the thick side, to make its bulk fall to the thinner side.    Yeah, if it's a complete switch, your scalp will hurt for a day or two, but after that, no problem.|`|7zf05NWsaa	Hi April.    I have very thin hair down to by butt. Very long.  There are parts of our hair that just doesnt grow. Like those spots right above the back of your neck... there is realy no way to fix them.    There is no miracle product that makes it thicker. But there are things that make it LOOK thicker.  Don't use conditioner in the shower and then blow dry it, that helps make mine seem thicker... be careful though, not using cond. can make it snap off while brushing....    Enjoy the hair you have!
AA11589437	Well, "Honey I shrunk the kids" had this story and "Nils Holgerson"  also had this story. They were both big success, but it all depends on teh story itself. A good idea may turn into a lousy story, it is not enough to make a good plot. It depends what this guy will be doing in the story.|`|xJwPKtX9aa	no. that sounds kinda stupid to be honest.|`|QvhPJAKyaa	no probabl not.  and wrong section mate.|`|wPnJekdqaa	People will read stories about absolutely anything, you've just got to make it interesting for them.
vi2bzq0Caa	As long as you are using leave-in conditioners, then this method of approach should be fine. I recommend that you use Tresemme's Heat Tamer Spray before blow drying your hair. Put leave-in creme conditioner on your hair before blow drying and after blow drying, preferably before you go to sleep. Cover your hair with a silk or satin scarf. Therefore, your hair can reap the benefits of maximum moisture.|`|dxeb0BfBaa	Its not ideal but its definitely a million times better than straightening your hair. Most conditioners will do this but you might want to try a smoothing cream instead if not keep using the conditioner, any product is better than straightening.|`|9w9eXmpBaa	You want to use a serum like John Frieda Frizz ease serum.  You want to also a leave in conditioner.  I also use loreal curling creme it leave my curls soft and sleek.    Good luck.|`|qyT15nmXaa	I tried that too once, but then I bought some serum to apply to my dry hair. It worked wonders. Condition your hair every time you wash AND use a leave-in conditioner and then serum. You'll have gorgeous shiny bouncy hair. x|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	Thats a really good idea but watch out because you could've mistaken your hair for being greesy or it could turn greesy really quickly.

rZj2DkeOaa	First of all sorry to hear what you're going through. Its good that you want to move on but remember don't change who you are for anyone. I think first you should start by building up your confidence. Get in touch with friends more often and surround yourself with people who make you feel good about yourself. Remind yourself of your own self worth. Make a list of your accomplishments, or compliments that your friends, colleagues or superiors have ever paid you. This will help you keep in mind that you may have some habits that need changing, but so does everyone else, and that you do have many redeeming qualities. Work out some positive affirmations to help you clear your mind of negative thoughts and emotions. Let your subconscious help you with moving on.    Maybe try working out a few times a week, you'll be amazed how great you feel after just one or two workout sessions!!  Start to spend more time on yourself..pamper yourself abit to give you a boost when you do go out. Concentrate on your best assets and try to accentuate them in how you dress.   Go shopping!!! Lots of shops offer a personal stylist for FREE...just ask around, higher end highstreet shop assistants will be more than happy to help you and will give you invaluable advice on trends and what clothes suit you. You don't have to spend a fortune to look good, its how you wear clothes that count.   The main thing is that you focus on building up your confidence, someoone can have the nicest clothes or be the prettiest person but still be unhappy because they feel no self worth or arent comfortable in their own skin. Don't forget that you will find somebody new in time but in order for someone else to love you , you need to start loving yourself again. Good luck!!|`|9W9l8HAuaa	starting with a new beginning-kuddos  hon, try to get a new style  buy those jeans that make you look sooo fine (lol)  try scoopnecked shirts in bright colors  don't be afraid of colors like pink and gold  don't forget to accesorizzze (walmart has jewlry too!)  as for the inside-just think about how good you are without him  dwell in the good stuff about you and forget the loseres in the past-there's a reason they didn't make it to your future!|`|nMkDpEQJaa	.: Congratulations you're on the right track :.    .: It's important to be with your circle of friends,  they will help you emotionally :.    .: Before you change yourself,  list the qualities you like about yourself and build from there :.    .: If you're having trouble,  ask the people closest to you :.    .: If you're short on cash maybe your friends would want to help out :.    .: With their permission, you can go trough their closet and pick what you want from the clothes they hardly wear :.    .: Ask a friend to give a make over then hit the club scene to celebrate :.

TBzEEolnaa	Depends on your age really, whether it would be seen as appropriate. But research the good things and the bad things about the piercing, good things being, it's easy to hide. Bad being, it hurts a lot and take some time to heal. Just provide them with information about it.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	ask them "Would you like me to get my ears pierced twice, or get my tongue pierced?" Tongue piercings are permanent. I know, and you probably know also, that you would not get your tongue pierced. But they do not know that. And tell them that you will pay for it.

They use keratin bond to bond human hair to your natural hair. you can get a do it yourself kit here http://manemaxx.com/basic-hair-extension... or you can get it done proffessionally at a salon     or wat you can do is tell your guy that you hav extensions so it wont be as shocking and get clip ins they stay put in your hair even with vigorous pulling if you snap them in right      or get glue in extensions by buying a weft of hair and some weave bond (glue)     also they make other kinds such as shrinkies, links, and u cood also use weave tape and a hair weft and tape the weft to your head (the tape is safe for your scalp)     Some options   http://www.doctoredlocks.com/store/insta...  http://www.doctoredlocks.com/store/weavi...  http://www.doctoredlocks.com/store/prebo...|`|ZmGDCTT7aa	CLIP-IN HAIR EXTENSIONS!

Best of Luck to you!|`|5DB6nOXkaa	okay don't do the emo thing, that trend is almost done.   The one usefull thing I have learned from the male gender is that they prefer girls with long natural hair.

Bzxxl5v3aa	Most people would respond to this question with a 'yes', but the truth is it is a 'maybe'. Makeup can be very bad for your skin. It causes wrinkles, acne, etc. but you can always prevent that. You can put it on lightly, instead of pounding your skin with it. And you can wash your face with a good cleanser twice a day. Also, there is also a new line of makeup products that Neutrogena has made, you can look at it here: http://www.neutrogena.com/econsumer/ntg/... So truthfully the answer is 'it is up to you'.

I would recommend loreal teloscopic mascara. sorry if the spelling is off. its in either a lime green or pink tube. The formula and brush are amazing.|`|GM3zog4Jaa	I have heard MAC Plush Lash is great.|`|sjrRM5y0aa	I have only used the MAC volumising mascara which is really runny so doesn't work very well.      I have quite long eyelashes already but I found L'oreal lash architect mascara amazing! It made my eyelashes long and defined, plus it's only around 10.     Otherwise I find Max factor Masterpiece mascara great, Benefits Bad Gal is good and now comes in blue and plum colours. Finally YSL's fake lash effect mascara is good once its dried out a little bit.    xxxx

Glue in extensions are really bad for your hair so I personally would just use the clip in ones sometimes I do if i want to thicken mine up a little bit.

dHkvVlONaa	Thats the same problem I have!!    My friend told me that just means it's not healed enough to take out yet.  It makes sense, you wouldn't want to just yank it out and damage the skin tissue around it.    What I would try-  While your in the shower, try to change it then, because the skin should be softer and loosened up and stuff, otherwise, try it after a sea salt soak.    Otherwise, go to a piercer, they should be able to help.    Good luck :)|`|9W9l8HAuaa	ask a tattoo artist?  be careful, and avoid infection!

But it depends if the cuts good on her and if it suits her. But I tend to not notice girls that wear sweat shirts or another item over and over, it becomes too samey, if you know what i mean.   Try something new, I think i nice cut polo shirt looks really good on most  girls.   It makes them look bigger? depends on the fit.

Do it about 3 times a day|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Well you should def. use saline solution but I used bactine on my lip and nose and tregus and it worked fantastically :D  Go buy some bactine and just apply it twice a day  also putting sea salt in water can help it if It's bad infected :D|`|z0HWA6vRaa	when i got my ears pierced i remember using rubbing alcohol on it...idk mebe for some weird reason an eyebrow piercing is diff then an ear...|`|NSNfPmEqaa	rubbing alcohol|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Sea salt solution is basically the same as wound wash (except is doesn't have preservatives or other chemicals in it) and is much less expensive. Pick up some non-iodized sea salt and mix 1/4 tsp sea salt in 8 oz warm water. Soak your piercing using a shot glass or small cup instead of trying to flush it out. Don't move the jewelry when you're cleaning it, this can damage the healing tissue and cause bleeding.    Please read my free article about piercing aftercare for more information:  http://www.shopperarticles.com/Piercing-...|`|OGpDgdJSaa	Try the same you've been doing with a quarter teaspoon of salt dissolved in a cup of boiling water. I recommend waiting till it cools a bit, learned that the hard way! It's what I used and and five months later, no problems. Hope this helps!

Done :-D
UrYYKkGoaa	Wash your hair, comb through some mousse, blow dry it til it's almost completely dry but not bone dry, then twist it into two little buns at the top of your head. After at least a quarter hour, longer if possible, take them out, finger a bit more mousse right into your roots, and blow dry the rest of the way with your head upside down. Then toussle it a bit with your fingers and finish with spray if you like.|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	well u like make is curly like that and then brush it and make it a little bit messy and flip it around and here u go :D|`|N0cmhQYJaa	thats probs just her natural hair

dxeb0BfBaa	Most pharmacies stock wash-in colours. Some come in liquid form, some in mousse. Bare in mind you will have to choose a colour darker than your own or you wont see the colour in your hair. L'oreal Paris do a mousse 1 called Colour Pulse which is good but you may need 2 or even 3 packs for long or thick hair.|`|hj952SLyaa	ye go to the place where sells dye it will be with them there in sachets and are small so you need to look out for them there not in boxes    I dont no where u live but boots sell them if you live in the uk|`|a1esFJ53aa	You can get non-permanent hair dyes in most stores and theyre usually found with the permanent dyes, just read the boxes!
BqnNXIAmaa	I believe that color would look very good on you esp. as highlights on black hair.  As long as their just jighlights you should be fine but if you ever dye your whole hair with color then you'll have to lighten it if you want to go lighter.  You can use Garnier Bleech, it works great if you ever do bleach your hair.  But I think just highlights would look great in your hair:)|`|pItlAgblaa	I dont know what butterscoth cream is, im assuming its a light brownish color? I personally think Asian women look great in lighter hair. BUT you cannot go lighter on black hair without lightening it first. This means you need to use a peroxide (a special hair peroxide at the pharmacy) to lighten it first, then you can dye it.   When I dye my hair I talk to the cosmetician at the pharmacy all the time; they can advise you what best to use. L'Oreal's instructions are usually pretty easy to use.

Colour, I don't really care about but curly or straight...  Hair length isn't a big problem for me either unless she has either a buzzcut or is completely bald.

Lo principal en una relacin sexual es el amor convertido en deseo. Trata de amar a tu pareja de tal forma que puedas crear un orgasmo solo con la mirada.  Aunque suene imposible o muy potico esa es la idea.  Jamas cometas el error de pensar que una relacin se centra solo en el coito, lo mejor es todo el prembulo.  As que en lugar de pensar si funciona o no, para intentar usarlo o no, mejor piensa en la forma en la que puedas amar mejor a tu pareja|`|4505f441743df7963c607e8c80826e29aa	chico, lo mejor para agrandar el pene es lo siguiente:   Tomas una soga y te buscas un ladrillo de construccin, amarras la soga al ladrillo, luego te bajas los pantalones y te amarras el otro extremo de la soga al pene..ojo! fjate que el ladrillo colgando de la soga que esta amarrada a tu pene quede exactamente a la altura de tu pantorrilla.

When you answer the questions make sure you repeat the question before giving your answer. Make eye contact and don't show nervousness. Ask the reigning queen to help you out a little.

ytYA9nxdaa	Why don't you get hair extensions??? they are pretty cool!!|`|UwLYCl2taa	first of all give up the hot iron, it will fry your hair and does more damage to your hair than good.  Instead try a good conditioner that will help your hair to be more tame and do not brush it after it is dry.  as far as your short legs, try a longer pant and a short heel, to where your pants fall about an inch above the floor, guaranteed to make you look taller, stay away from short shirts, or belly button shirts, that will also make you look taller.  Don't worry too much, you aren't to old to grow a little more and when you get my age (30) you will wish you appreciated your own natural, youthful beauty more when it was there.|`|583e5d537a6d410ad98990c6d6250044aa	Your friend is likely very secure and outgoing.  People with confidence and friendly personalities always attract more people.  Your being "second" is probably just your imagination.  However, you said you were popular too, so why compete with her?  You'll just end up making yourself miserable.  Be yourself and be friendly.  Relax and don't worry about what she's doing.  You'll be much happier.|`|c10d0392e6bd01a3c10fb1d03c8c6a7caa	Be you, looking fake will only get her so far in life.  You seem to have the whole package.

Your wardrobe sounds great for school... don't go to class looking like you're going clubbing or go to school everyday with perfect hair and make up. Thats a good lesson, because your friend probably goes to school everyday looking the best she knows how to look, and so when you see her outside of class for special events the way she looks is no longer anything special... but anyway, in your case just have confidence and try to be unique. Add some cool accessories to those Hollister clothes that everyone has and read lots of magazines and mostly invest in some cheap jewelley at Claire's. Try just having a cute layered cut with sideswept bangs and put your hair in a cute messy updo for school.   just have CONFIDENCE! I'm sure you and your friend are awesome in your own ways and if you want her style to rub off on you, just continue to hang out with her.   and by the way, wearing heels is a great way to make your legs like slimmer. remember, you cannot change your body shape so don't try and believe that you can

Le soutien gorge doit tre avant tout adapt a la femme qui le porte et faire le maintien comme il est sens faire (saviez vous que beaucoup de femme portent un soutien gorge mal adapt?). Ensuite, cela depend aussi de l'usage et de la taille de la poitrine.     A titre personel, j'ame le soutien gorge qui met la poitrine de ma copine en valeur, mais je dsire avant tout qu'elle se sente bien et n'ai pa de problme de dos a cause d'un soutien gorge non adapt. Donc quand elle veux me faire plasir (un tout dentelles a balconnet), sachant que cela n'est pas le plus adapt pour elle, elle ne le porte que pour avoir le plaisir que je l'enlve ou eventuellement si nous sortons le soir car j'aime savoir ce qu'elle porte... ;)|`|QQaU4h0uaa	comme je mets beaucoup de dollets plongeants, j'opte souvent pour le push-up, parce que je n'ai pas la poitrine de pamela anderson|`|bFvDljnpaa	push up !

99b688e76b75f46b8a5d14d59066d8b5aa	Hello My Friend,    Wow, you're so lucky your mum's with you on this.   Here's some advice - be calm, don't worry, don't think about it when they do it, don't look at it. Sing a song out loud, a happy song you like. Thats what I did, and I din't even realise when they were done!    Be calm and don't be stiff. Good luck and most importantly, enjoy your piercing!!    Yvonne.|`|9MpoHWsoaa	Just tell yourself that you'll love it.  And it doesn't really hurt all that much.  At least, it didn't hurt me, but I have a fairly high threshold for pain.  Also, make sure you follow the piercer's directions to the letter.|`|63DmFVehaa	I DONT RECOMEND IT MY SKIN REJECTED MY PIERCING AND THE SCAR IS BAD|`|N8DPyHesaa	Umm wow, your mom made the appointment. I was 18 when I got mine done and my mom made a huge deal out of it.... anyways... It really didn't hurt. My best friend came with me and she covered my eyes so that I wouldn't look. I didn't see it coming so I pretty much didn't anticipate the pain. I think that the anticipation is more scary than the actual piercing.  You'll be fine. Just keep it clean and DON'T mess with it all the time. When I did mine a bunch of other girls did it too and they kept pulling on it and touching it on work, they all got infections from messing with it with their dirty hands. Just keep it clean, don't bother with it too much.... you'll be fine.|`|8182a6d548c94db89d0b66b5271650c4aa	Just be calm. It only hurts for a second. And when it is over, you will be so pumped you will forget all about it.|`|hVXkLisVaa	Drink plenty of water the day before and of.    Maybe take some ibuprofen to help stave off the pain - it will hurt like hell.    Pop some vicodin if you got anything that strong.    DO NOT DRINK the night before or the day or - alcohol will make you bleed more.    Other than that, that is all you really need to know.    ** People are still getting their navel's pierced? That is so 1994.|`|ezpaCQuIaa	well first off its good your going with someone it makes everything alot eaiser.   Just be clam and try not to think about it and try not to look at the needle that will make it worse i did and it scared the hell out of me.  Just take a deep breath and bam its over you will feel a little pinch and thats it.  after wards make sure you clean it like 3 to 4 times a day.  dont play with it and if your ganno touch it make sure your hands are clean.  and be carful with what you wear for the next week or so cuz u dont want it to yank at it.  I am sure you do fine Just think think about how much your love it once it is done i know i did.  Good luck.|`|oTOZP1m4aa	I had the same thing happen as Aztec... My body rejected the piercing. I even had it done twice!! And yes, I have a nasty scar also...I'm not saying don't get it done, but there is always the possibility of your body not likeing the piercing!    Good luck girl!!|`|fYAhTmmmaa	you loook like your allready ready to go dont be nervouse  the the excitment take over  this will be with yuo for a wile if looked after the pain will last 2-3 second nothing not as bad as haveing a blood test|`|015632ffd4d58ea1441023497bc304f3aa	take deep breaths so you dont pass out

UFq43gU4aa	worst places to get tattooed: palm of hands, bottom of feet, chest, ribs/side/stomach, feet/hands, private parts, inner arm/inner thigh    i have my feet and sides/stomach done. my boyfriend who is a tattoo artist has his palms, chest, top of hands and side/stomach.     the spine and the ankle doesn't hurt like these other places hurt. If they did hurt so bad, you wouldn't see every joe schmo with ankle and spine tattoos.   If you want to get a big piece, you shouldn't focus on where would be most painful. If you are serious about getting a tattoo you should be way more focused on how the tattoo flows with your body, what design, etc.   A lot of people feel more proud about getting their tattoos when they find a design that suits them and they get it in a painful spot. To some people it makes it more worth it.   Hope this helps.|`|0a0a4d74d7f2f7b6fb7a2b9d67428c9daa	private parts|`|IhAPkBrvaa	most painful: top of foot, inside of arm, ankle    top of foot: crying painful  inside of arm: pretty damn bad for most people  ankle: not as bad as the other two, but still painful|`|hpucddxfaa	Tattoos on the top of the foot supposedly hurt the most.  Places where your skin is most sensitive also hurt.  For example:  ditch (the bend in your arm), inside of arms, inside of thighs, ribs, etc.|`|hRXVfUGHaa	The painful parts are the ones close to the bone since there are lesser tissues to cushion the skin.  Examples would be rib cage and foot.  If you want lesser pain, go for the fleshy part of your body like your abdomen, arms or thighs.  Also, choose a skillful tattoo artist since they have a way of working with their needle to lessen the pain.

Take it from a licensed cosmetologist, get professional help just be on the safe side. If not your going to end up spending the same amount of money on boxes of cheap a$$ hair color trying to get the desired shade.

b8MqIU5Vaa	I think your outfit sounds cute and fashionable for the most part, but I would suggest changing two things.   1) Instead of the green vest top, go with perhaps a grey or black tank top underneath, to match your pants or hat.   2) I would go with either dark purple or black flats, instead of the boots.  The flats will make your legs appear long and thin, and flats always look great with skinny jeans.  |`|laXOkUD1aa	I think the boots are fine. Don't listen to them telling you to wear flats. I mean it is Ugg season escpecilly if you live up north. Its already snowing. The shirt sounds good. Just not so sure about the green. It might look cute though? Who knows. Go with your gut.|`|nC1HQHVRaa	I think that would look really cool, except the beanie, you don't want to have hat hair if you take it off. also, i think the outfit would be cool if you wore black flats instead of uggs, flats are way cute and dainty, and they won't make you any taller.    It seems like you have cool style, but if these people are your friends then you shouldn't worry about what your are wearing. The best advice i can give you is too make sure you are wearing something that you feel comfortable in, which will give you confidence, the ultimate fashion  accessory!|`|K4HpjaIEaa	I think that if they are really your friends they won't care what you wear.

Wear light makeup to highlight your favourite feature, eyes or lips. Use colours that match your colouring, like darker eyeliner and plum, brown, and blue eye shadows. Use a powder to even out your skin. Get your hair cut in layers to give it volume, and use a colour mask to make it shine. Wear clothes that accentuate a slim figure, like skinny jeans in a dark wash or boot cut jeans, fitted tops, and tighter sweaters. you could also try leggings and empire waist tops. Go for colours that you look good in. For shoes, try flats. |`|2tSs95wZaa	ya u need me in ur life then ull be perfect|`|Iduk7paTaa	don't be ugly|`|6pHRsqdgaa	you are alread prety. dont change|`|H2GtyEB0aa	sounds like you're pretty any way      but maybe for a change you should get blonde highlights |`|IEbAfujAaa	haha good one king mussab. we need pics|`|Yo2Wn8wUaa	Sounds like you have everything going for you.

Advanced vector calculus proves that it is impossible to comb all hairs on a male human head in the same general direction, even with the application of copious quantities of superhold styling gel. As a result, there exists (at least) one point on every male human head of which the hair growing from out of all surrounding points spirals outwards. This particular point (termed a "bald spot" in barberology) lacks hair, because the sun shines there without mercy, like in a lifeless desert. Therefore, all men possess (at least) one bald spot, especially Socrates.|`|eceb19400893ec3d8e0da007d820dcc2aa	Baldness or hair loss is typically something only adults need to worry about. But in a few cases, teens lose their hair, too  and it may be a sign that something's going on. Hair loss during adolescence can mean a person's sick or maybe just not eating right. Some medications or medical treatments, like chemotherapy treatment for cancer, also cause people to lose their hair. And people can even lose their hair if they wear a hairstyle that pulls on their hair for a long time, such as braids.    Losing hair can be stressful during a time when appearance really matters, but the good news is that hair loss that happens during the teen years is often temporary. Once the problem that causes it is corrected, the hair usually grows back.  Hair Basics    Our hair is made of a type of protein called keratin. A single hair consists of a hair shaft (the part that shows), a root below the skin, and a follicle, from which the hair root grows. At the lower end of the follicle is the hair bulb, where the hair's color pigment, or melanin, is produced.    Most people lose about 50 to 100 head hairs a day. These hairs are replaced  they grow back in the same follicle on your head. This amount of hair loss is totally normal and no cause for worry. If you're losing more than that, though, something may be wrong. The medical term for hair loss  losing enough hair that a person has visibly thin or balding patches  is alopecia.    If you have unusual hair loss and don't know what's causing it, it's a good idea to see your doctor. A doctor can determine why the hair is falling out and suggest a treatment that will correct the underlying problem, if necessary.  What Causes Hair Loss?    Here are some of the things that can cause hair loss in teens:        * Illnesses or medical conditions. Endocrine (hormonal) conditions, such as uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease, can interfere with hair production and cause hair loss. People with kidney and liver diseases and lupus can also lose hair. The hormone imbalance that occurs in polycystic ovary syndrome can cause hair loss in teen girls as well as adult women.      * Medications. Some medications that have hair loss as a side effect may be prescribed for teens. These include acne medicines like isotretinoin, and lithium, which is used to treat bipolar disorder. Diet pills that contain amphetamines can also cause hair loss. Chemotherapy drugs for cancer are probably the most well-known medications that cause hair loss, but some cancers including leukemia and lymphoma can cause hair loss even before treatment begins.      * Alopecia areata (pronounced: air-ee-ah-tuh). This skin disease causes hair loss on the scalp and sometimes elsewhere on the body. It affects 1.7% of the population, including more than 4 million people in the United States. Alopecia areata is thought to be an autoimmune disease, in which the hair follicles are damaged by a person's own immune system. (In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells, tissues, and organs in a person's body.) Alopecia areata usually starts as one or more small, round bald patches on the scalp and can progress to total hair loss, although total hair loss only happens in a small number of cases. Both guys and girls can get it, and it often begins in childhood. The hair usually grows back in 6 months to 2 years, but not always.      * Trichotillomania (pronounced: trik-o-til-uh-may-nee-uh). Trichotillomania is a psychological disorder in which people repeatedly pull their hair out, often leaving bald patches. It results in areas of baldness and damaged hairs of different lengths. People with trichotillomania usually need professional help from a therapist or other mental health professional before they can stop pulling their hair out.      * Hair treatments and styling. Having your hair chemically treated, such as getting your hair colored, bleached, straightened, or permed, can cause damage that may make the hair break off or fall out temporarily. Another type of baldness that results from hair styling can actually be permanent: If a person wears his or her hair pulled so tightly that it places tension on the scalp, it can result in a condition called traction alopecia. Traction alopecia can be permanent if the style is worn for a long enough time that it damages the hair follicles.      * Poor nutrition. Poor eating can contribute to hair loss. This is why some people with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia lose their hair: The body isn't getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals to sustain hair growth. Some teens who are vegetarians also lose their hair if they don't get enough protein from non-meat sources. And some athletes are at higher risk for hair loss because they may be more likely to develop iron-deficiency anemia.      * Disruption of the hair growth cycle. Some major events can alter the hair's growth cycle temporarily. For example, delivering a baby, having surgery, or getting anesthesia can temporarily stop the hair growth cycle. (Because the hair we see on our heads has actually taken months to grow, a person may not notice any disruptions of the hair growth cycle until months after the event that caused it.) This type of hair loss corrects itself.      * Male-pattern baldness. Among adults, particularly men, the most common cause of hair loss is androgenetic (pronounced: an-druh-juh-neh-tik) alopecia, also called male-pattern baldness. This condition is caused by a combination of factors, including hormones called androgens and genetics. In some males, the hair loss can start as early as the mid-teen years. It can also occur in guys who take steroids like testosterone to build their bodies.    What Can Doctors Do?    If you see a doctor about hair loss, he or she will check your scalp and, in some cases, may take hair samples. You may also be tested for|`|0ODpApgQaa	Everyone loses hair and this is inescapable, but there is no reason not to push back the process. Here's how you can do that: Make a drink by blending bananas, honey, yogurt and low fat milk. This drink is rich in biotin and will help your hair to have strong roots. Ensure your diet is rich in Vitamin B6, zinc and saw palmetto. Use supplements if you cannot get enough from natural food sources. Bend your head while you are shampooing and massage your scalp. This will increase blood circulation to the scalp.   Get rid of stress and this is most dangerous for your lovely hair. Get sufficient sleep. Like a healthy body, healthy hair too needs a good night's sleep.|`|k9Mn8J5Eaa	Your body's level of DHT production (which is hereditary to some extent) is the main culprit. Case in point, it's hormonal. Either your body produces a lot of testosterone or you are genetically predisposed to being very sensitive to the effects of DHT. If you also have a lot of body hair or thick body hair it is definitely DHT levels. It may also be from stress, a reaction to Sulfactants (common inside many of the cheaper soaps/shampoos/conditioners), or a poor diet high in transitive fats. It's not uncommon to develop hair loss as early as 17, I sure did. If you don't want to see it progress than you need to do something about it now, because once the follicles have shrunken and closed for over 2 years or so it will be forever impossible to bring that hair back. Consider Finasteride or Propecia, both of which come in generic versions which are available cheaper from international pharmacies (order online). Consuming lots of soy also helps somewhat, it is a testosterone atagonist to some degree. Be aware that balding is essentially an effect of testosterone, and as such any means to combat it will involve hormonal altercation which runs the (small but very real) risk of diminished sexual drive and/or function. Topical Minixoidil (Rogaine) will help hair follicles open up and discourage shrinking but it alone is not enough to reverse balding, it will only slow it or enhance the effects of Finasteride/Propecia.|`|k8vtsvQpaa	First off don't use pantene or head and showders!!!

c46140f0ed1bdf47a7f332d7d6ea3dc0aa	Yes, I have a tattoo under my belly button about two inches and to the right. It didn't hurt very much at all. It was my first tattoo and the artist even said while she was tatting me that the belly is the easiest place for anyone to get a tat because everyone naturally has more fatty tissue in that area, providing a cushion. Tattoos hurt more on bonier parts of your body. The tattoo I have on my spine was way more painful than my belly tattoo, but still not bad.    My tattoo is a shooting star.    I've never known a guy with a tattooed penis and never seen one, so I can't really help you there.|`|61b97bd80f1c8f86793653e731e1dafeaa	i heard one guy got a tattoo on his balls, but i never saw it|`|YwZ2uuTFaa	yes i have a tat of my hubbys name an stars around it on my bikini line. i mean to tell you gurl i was grabbing on everything i could, and i was sweating! once that needle hits your hipbone good GOD it hurt! im glad his name is mac and not like sebastion or something! but it was well worth it!|`|aLHoppq8aa	My homegirl and I got matching tattoos on our girl bits-two cherries surrounded by the words "Thick" "Juicy" "Sexy"...Having had two kids launched out from between my thighs(translated-vaginal delivery) and having been stitched up after both of them-I must say that it was one of the LEAST painful tattoo I have gotten.   I was not spread eagle or anything. I was laying on my back, legs closed, and pants pulled down to right above the start of the line of the labia majora. It didn't take long at all, and barely hurt.
2555c225910822fa562cc2f5895bf01daa	have you ever considered getting a perm, preferably a relaxer?   always where a cap in the shower.  apply mouse and detangler to your wet hair.  use clear ice or some other light palmade to groom.  get a straw set.  use a diffuser when you blow dry it.  find a product that maintians that just out the shower look.  wear it is braids or two strand twists.  exclusively use aveda or carol's daughter.  shave it all off and let it grow back-it'll have a different texture.  invest in some high quality combs, brushes, and accessories.  build a real good relationship with a hairdresser.  thinning your hair is not a good idea. it'll probablly fall out, unless you have it processed and layered by a professional.|`|AA12166648	take these pics to a hair stylist and they can thin your hair plus relax or perm it to get these kinds of curls.|`|StFraZ2iaa	My son is biracial..his dad is bahamian and im cuban.When he grew his hair out it was such a pain so i can relate to ur problem.After his shower I would pick it,grease it all up,which I found a moisturizer called motions..yellow bottle in the ethnic section of hair products basically anywhere..wal-mart,walgreens.This will help u.But do not cut ur hair,let it grow out,it will get easier to deal with.Just keep it moisturized.and try some mousse too.aussie is pretty good.|`|C1PyCb6Daa	Im biracial also and my hair is the same way. You don't want to thin your hair cuz you'll regret it later on when you get older, but you can get a perm(which you probably don't need or want) or just get it cut in layers. I have layers and it makes it easier to manage after I wash and blow dry it. I use rollers in my hair to keep it curly and bouncy. My friend who is also biracial uses a type of styling gel to give it that wet look, but your hair sounds much thicker than hers. Just consult a stylist and ask what would be best...|`|91f2ee1de714e7f96f48ab133de02cf3aa	You can get in thinned.  Mu daughter has THICK hair and she gets it thinned every couple of months.  It doesn't look so poofy!  Most importantly moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.    Use a good conditioner, I like Pantene Relaxed and Natural.  Use a product made for your hair type such as Curls.  You can place a moisturizing product on you hair when it is wet and that should loosen the curls.  If possible stay away from relaxers.  It's ok to get one but they can be hard on your hair so if don't have to get one, don't.  See a good stylist.

VAZBvsoRaa	Lo de las muy delgadas es un concepto que esta cambiando y muy apresuradamente, tanto que ya varios modistos han eliminado de sus listas a las modelos demasiado delgadas, casi anorxicas, sustituyendolas con personas bellas , pero, de la vida real.Por fin entendieron que sus trajes los van a usar mujeres de verdad-verdad y que esos seres fantasmagricos , solo se vean en las pasarelas. Sobre la simetra en el rostro, si tienes muchsima razn,;  se realizaron estudios sobre la belleza y en todos coincidieron que mientras mas simtricos eran los rostros mas se aproximaban al ideal de belleza.

AA10439495	Everybodies reaction to foreign objects in their body is different.  I thought it would hurt a lot and it really didn't.  I think my toungue actually swelled to double its size.  It went down within a week.  I was still able to talk just fine though. I didn't have to take any work off and i work at an auto parts store where i'm talking all the time.  Eating is the only thing that i had a problem doing but that was cool after a week too. Total time for healing is about 2 - 3 weeks.  That was me though. oh yeah they say to use listerine, but there is another none alcohol based mouth wash i used called biotene, felt better on the tongue and apparently did its job cause i had no problems.    And to the people that think  others are retarted or weird or whatever you have your right to opinion but know this just because someone is tatted up or have peircing you don't agree with doesn't make them less of a person than you are.  Both of these self mutilation practices have been around for hundreds of years.  just cause you don't agree with it doesn't make it wrong, just means you won't get it done to yourself.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	The pain isn't bad, you'll talk funny for a few days (sort of slurred speach, or a bit of a lisp) But after about 3 days the swelling goes down a bit and you should be fine.

You will hear a "POP" and it's over. I would ask for about 2-3 days. The tat on the back of your neck hurt a lot more.    To avoid "mistakes" make sure that you go to a LICENSED piercing studio. The piercer will know exactly where to place it. They will ask you where you want it, and you can make the decision. An experienced piercer will show you the place that will be safe.    Make sure you have ice cream and jello handy. You won't be able to eat too much, because your tongue will be swollen.     Make sure that if you do do it, that you follow their instructions. You must rinse you mouth with Listerine several times a day.     AND>>>>>>>>> make sure that the ball is screwed on tightly >>>>>>>>>>> you don't want to swallow it.

If u have all that done, then im sure u can deal with the pain|`|ed298188deb6392b817fa41a53d82107aa	I do not believe the actual risk of your face being paralyzed is very high at all.  When I got my tongue pierced a long time ago, I did not take any days off of work.  I worked as a telemarketer at the time, and it was difficult to speak due to swelling, but I managed.  Your tongue will be swollen anywhere from a couple of days to a week.  I want to warn you about one of the risks of getting your tongue pierced.  I was never told about this risk and ended up spending several thousand dollars a few years later because of it.  My tongue piercing sat against my lower front teeth constantly.  This caused my gums to recede and caused bone loss in my teeth.  If I had not spent $4000.00 getting surgery to replace the bone and repair some of the gum tissue, my teeth would have fallen out.  My periodontist said that a good portion of his patients had had their tongue pierced and has suffered from gum and tooth damage due to this piercing.  Even after all the surgery I had, my gum tissue will not grow back between my two lower front teeth.  This has left me with a small space where the gum tissue should normally be.  If I had known this would be the result of my piercing, I would never have gotten it!  Anyway, your mouth, your choice.  I hope that this information will be useful to you.  Good luck!

hCdCxaVcaa	It depends on what mole you have. If you have a raised mole, anything you use to cover it will probably make it look a lot worse - like a giant wart. If you have a flat one, Bobbi Brown and Mac at Sephora both do a good concealer. The Nars one is good, too. All of these come in many colours.    If I were you, I would be tempted to make a feature of it. Many very beautiful people have facial moles: Cindy Crawford, Marilyn Monroe, Wallis Simpson, etc. Others have actually painted them on, such as Madonna and Marie Antoinette. Why not just be proud of it?     In the case of any large or uneven mole, especially if irregularly shaped, you should have it examined by a dermatologist. Such moles can be a risk factor in skin cancer. If so, the dermatologist will probably recommend you have it removed, which will solve your problem permanently.|`|Br3iyUc9aa	get the bareminerals   1. good for your skin  2. great concealer  3. costs a bi though  4. like $50|`|a43a3abd43486a4b2f5a9cdf6718c783aa	Well if you hate the mole why dont you use all this energy to cover it up and get it removed. I honestly am grossed out by moles and when I am talking to someone with one on their face, that's all I can look at is how ugly and revolting the thing is. If I had a wart or mole on my face, it would be off asap. For me, if I hate it, it's probably bothering someone else, too. And if its removed, you wont have to worry about it any more.

Especially if you are young...its a good time to experiment with style.  A piercing can always be taken out, so if you hate it, then there is no damage done.  If your parents wont let you, then you are SOL|`|MFKgVsoAaa	i personally don't like them because it's very distracting from the face. it just naturally attracts the eye, and you find yourself staring at the side of someone's lips instead of their eyes. also, it might not work when you're older and are trying to get a job (yea some people out there are that shallow). i'm not saying you shouldn't get it, that's just my personal opinion and what i would do. hope i helped!|`|BXVyCQZFaa	Trashy.|`|3OTE1t5eaa	I think they look nice on some people. My friend has one and it's cute on her. As for getting parents to approve it hmm I don't really know what to tell u on that matter. They usually stay set in their ways when it comes to piercings and tattoos.
j3g5UapGaa	yea a lot of times it is because we dont care about looks as much as guys do. If i see a guy who may not be hottest but he's really sweet and funny and jsut a great guy i will definatley date him :)|`|kDu2lyIEaa	Generally 'cause they're genuine and treat a girl how they like to be treated.  Also because girls like the thrill of knowing that the guy is attracted to her, and if the guy is really attarctive, they might feel threatened...|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Generally not true, as girls are very conscious of looks. The truth is that most girls, teenagers especially, will just go out with any guy if he asks them, as it looks good to have a boyfriend.|`|PWkWptVuaa	It depends on different people - some people only care about looks and some just focus on personality.  Loads of girls are shallow!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Maybe because they really love them. That and they just want a boyfriend. I'm picky about looks and personality so I don't date much.|`|eyJHcoz7aa	could be because some girls have a low self confidence so they don't believe that can attract any good looking guys?|`|f3LrMhqWaa	no, it's because a lot of good-looking guys are up themselves and tend to treat you worse than other guys.girls will look at looks initially but will then go for the guy for his personality!
jSjb5DUeaa	- drink a lot of water  - eat healthy food ( honestly it helps with everything, complection and body)  - don't wash your hair everyday, unless its really oily and dirty  - in the winter your lips can get really cracked, so use your tooth brush and brush your lips gently (exfoliate) and then put chapstick/lipbalm on  - put chapstick on your cuticles, it helps peeling in the winter  - put kiwi on the eyes to decrease puffiness  - try not to share makeup, especially eye make up  - putting yogurt on your face makes it feel soft and it absorbes excess oil
2RkDecZwaa	bangs|`|LydL7EN6aa	bangs?|`|X9pkSMvMaa	The Fringe!|`|dUBRceBcaa	Fringe.    LOL X|`|aqaTqSHnaa	Fringe|`|mgTZD9Teaa	In the UK it's called a fringe in America it's bangs.|`|H7UphlLCaa	bangs?|`|ijXOMlIsaa	eye brows :-)|`|cfoXbkflaa	BANGS!!! in U.S its bangs|`|fa2QzsaKaa	side bang  : )
w517EPDnaa	All you do it put your jeans on and take a pair of scissors and rub on your jeans until they start to rip.  it doesn't take as long as it sounds. and from there you can pick whether or not you want your hole to have those threads or just a hole.|`|3OTE1t5eaa	Like the other person said, sandpaper. u can also use a cheese grader. U just put a hard object inside the jeans under whatever part you want to wear out and go to grading it until u get it the way u want then wash em.|`|EBjyMCeCaa	Sandpaper.  Make sure u don't over do it tho because holes will get larger every time you wash them!|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Sandpaper.|`|KozglaDxaa	sandpaper. or put knee pads on and slide on the road. it makes it look frayed and like ones at the store lol|`|ePkiOzPSaa	Wear them out instead of trying to make them look worn out to be fashionable.
V20PTwMmaa	Wear them with a hot pink top ...rock his world xoxo|`|znp0vztUaa	A darker jacket, some boots [if you have some] that are cute.   A baby doll top, that is quarter length so you're not freezing, but okay.if you carry purses then get a bag that would coordinate. I don't know what length you're hair is, or what hairstyles you like to put them in. But, I like to do either up-dos or half up half down because it'll have style but, not totally in you're space.  You can make it work! =)  Really hope I helped.|`|ipqH3UcWaa	anything with a lighter shirt i guess|`|m1IQDoUAaa	Where them with a darker shirt but not too dark!!!|`|6NVfP2Rcaa	I would pair the jeans with a darker sweater and tuck them in boots.
eGpOIV12aa	nice bargin, 60% off
OsHjXzxUaa	make sure u put it on the actual like flat part under ur eye, before ur lashes, not on them or under them. but if its too dark, then try putting it on lighter. and if thats still too bold try a plum or a dark green that shud deffinately help and ull still get the same kind of look just less dramatic.... well hope this helped :) good luck|`|LREo3Tjpaa	do a very thin line. if your liner isn't gel then set it against your flat iron and let it melt a bit to get a liquidy then apply a thin strip this may help to over that apply some eyeshadow against the bottom line in the thin line also, use a light color.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Do a smoky gray or brown color, and don't cake it on! ^-^|`|oGlikPYxaa	Just use a little bit.|`|leneiWBlaa	you can't................         muahahahahaha|`|Yw8X1aXsaa	don't wear black clothes or red or chains with it|`|Qlpj04L3aa	Don't draw all the way across the bottom. Draw it lightly from the outer corner to the just below the inside of the iris. Then try to blend it a little.|`|VN8kBnuRaa	I ALWAYS wear black eyeliner on my bottom and never have been told it looks gothic.  But if your using LIQUID eye liner, which I do, don't do a solid line, dot it across the bottom. If your using a stick eye liner dont over do. Draw a thing, light line.|`|tg89r7ZJaa	put it on light and who cares what people say and you shouldent be looking like a goth or emo because everybody buts it on the bottom with out looking like that you most be doing something wrong...|`|6juYbfUVaa	tell them to back off, you look like whatever you want to look like, and anyways, you could just put the eyeliner on the inside but not the outside, sometimes it helps.|`|1fUWIR8maa	Put the eyeliner on your waterline?  the area just above your bottom eyelashes =]|`|lsODR7A0aa	what i do is get a thin liner. Try define a line by maybeline it goes on very smooth and doesn't look heavy. I also put in as close as my eye (without getting in my eye) as I can.    Good Luck!|`|SD4Cnrenaa	wear a little bit of the eye liner, don't over do the make up. one of my old friends wore waaayyyy too much black eye make up, and she looked like she had raccoon eyes because she put too much eye make up on. only wear 1 layer, no more!|`|s3FWCRGxaa	okay black eyeliner isnt just for "goths" and "emos" you must be like.. a little girl.|`|EgUkZZ3Caa	Some people just don't look good in black eye liner.  If you like the way it looks thats really all that matters.    But, if you don't, and you're in need of a change.  and you still enjoy the black over oher colors.    You put it on the inner part, obviously, and then just below the eye lashes, you get either whites browns any skin tone color eye shadows, and blend.    If you're willing to open up to new kinds of makeup try browns.  use more on top part of eye, then you put eye shadow, any color works. then you put little amount on the bottom. Your eyes will pop so much!    whites work, bottom eye, blend with gold eye shadows, top, and bottom.    DON'T OVER DO IT THOUGH.  that can make it go from good to gocky.    hope this helped any.|`|GKJEgidzaa	:-S , yes you can, of course you can. Wearing a bit of liner doesn't make you an emo.|`|kfrWN7wQaa	Rim the inside of your lid. Not under the lashes. With a natural looking eyeshadow and some mascara on only the top lashes to draw the attention up (putting mascara on the bottom lashes pulls the attention down and would look more goth). This is a regular makeup habit of celebrities like   Cameron Diaz  http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2...  and Angelina Jolie  ( http://api.ning.com/files/RjmwYlpOz0zsG7... )|`|x7Tt8WwGaa	You won't look emo as long as you VERY THINLY apply eyeliner to your lower lid. If you over-do it, you will look goth/emo. If this doesn't work, use brown eyeliner instead. It has almost the same effect as black eyeliner except there is a guarantee it won't make you look emo.|`|ISbCiVjGaa	a lighter eye shadow|`|wfbr4b5baa	try and just put it on lightly.   pull down on ur eye and slide the eyeliner lightly across ur like eyelid line or w.e its called lol|`|SLFdccP7aa	ugh, I put my eyeliner, top and bottom as thick as hell... it doesnt look emo. or goth. so dont worry.... and anyway your SUPPOSED to wear it on the top AND bottom.|`|F1dXjTataa	Try an get the liner as close to your lash line as possible.  You can also use an eyeshadow instead a liner which will be a lot lighter.  Make sure you blend.|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	Wear the black and on your eyelid wear a light shadow|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	wear it like this girl    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yavx9yxTr...|`|mDkDohbZaa	put it on lightly. gosh.|`|ILw3Rw3Jaa	dont put alot on you shouldnt look like an emo by wearin a bit of eyeliner, x|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	Apply it on your waterline. It doesn't look goth.|`|9UgGwvtlaa	lool goth or emo?  since when do goth and emos claim a particular look..there are dramatic arab eyes out there u know or dramatic looks, its not "emo"...if u watch youtube u would know how to.    i would say youtube...because for things like this u must be visual!!!   u actually must see it done  there are AMAZING makeup artists on youtube|`|AA11945637	do not overdo|`|0UOHex1Maa	Just put a very small, very thin line on the bottom. Don't make it very dark or very thick.|`|hj952SLyaa	check my video it may help|`|qOKFuXfLaa	well, that means you are applying it to harshly.  Do 1 coat pf black, or use a brown liner instead.|`|pFS2LZGKaa	Maybe you should try another color less harsh, such as brown, or if you really want to wear black, just wear it on the outer corner or your eye and blend it with a q-tip|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Just put a bit on. and dont put it on the top aswell.   Thats what i do and i dont think i look like a EMO... lol.     Other than that you could just tell people to shut their mouth... lol.
hj952SLyaa	Yes wear a light eyeshadow it will look great!!|`|rHAiO9Ghaa	I'm not sure what your first question was honey, but you could email me on phoebe.richards86@yahoo.com or IM me and I'll be more than willing to help. I'm a professional qualified make-up artist and cosmetologist.    xx|`|wfbr4b5baa	yeah most likely. try and wear a light eyeshadow also.|`|6juYbfUVaa	wear light eyeshadow that can show of your eyes a little|`|RILCsJGlaa	i agree with the girl bellow
ucZOCMyAaa	yes. Anything that is 100% cotton WILL shrink if you put it in the dryer.    Wash it, but leave it hanging to dry, instead of using the dryer.|`|5aed1b802869f555810a704dd5c6a29eaa	it depends on whether or not it is preshrunk. you need to check the label. if it does not indicate either way i would bet that it will shrink.
KHiNdxGJaa	i think they r very cute. they're stunning yet casual. u can wear them a lot. good luck:)|`|3OTE1t5eaa	I don't wear heels much, but I would wear those bcuz they are very cute.|`|igrdohopaa	Omg yes! (=|`|KFwXBXv7aa	very cute|`|MFKgVsoAaa	i like the idea, but they look a bit slutty. but if you do get them, get the gray- they're the cutest still without being too slutty. hope i helped!|`|kl0YIHY4aa	omg those are so adorable!!|`|VDubl7Dfaa	I think the pink ones are cute. The grey ones just look dull. And the black ones make me think of a funeral. Only thing i don't like about them is the sides...like if you wore them you could see the sides of your feet. They wouldn't look cute on me; but they would on you i bet!|`|Jvvbt85jaa	yea! those are awsome!|`|AA11711110	yes!|`|kcCFEP3qaa	I personally don't like them but if you do then buy them  :)|`|KgwHBGg3aa	i dont like it how they're lacy and the heel is kinds short i prefer these..    http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...|`|7nrhPCf0aa	yeah i like them|`|XbZKeISoaa	Yeah but in black|`|vdIXzX4naa	Yes - cute and original!

VZudmlOoaa	Hi, I'm from England, and I have to say I LOVE the american accent. Some people say it can get annoying, but I suppose that's just if you're not used to it. But I do really like it, and especially as Ive always wanted to visit America and I really want to live there when Im older, as I just love everything about it! - All the things you see on films...even the frigging cell phone / trash can / yellow school buses look so amazing! haha... the words we use are different and yes, everyone tries talking in an American accent!! I guess you'd find it quite funny actually.    Have you ever seen the film, 'Wild Child'?? It's absolutely amazing! And the main character with the american accent blatently has the coolest accent! aha    Interesting question :)  x|`|OicmMBIjaa	Do you even know the difference between England and Britain? Great Britain is divided into three counties; England, Scotland and Wales. They all have different accents. So you can't say British accent because it doesn't make sense nor does it exist - you could be referring to an English, Scottish or Welsh accent. Therefore, people in England have English accents, not British accents.    Learn from your mistakes.|`|maQTi6Aeaa	Hey, I'm an American girl, but I was just wondering what you think about men with British accents. Do you think British or American sounds more manly? Weird Q, I know, but I've always wondered. :)

o5aHZ1Xdaa	this is definitely not recommended... yeah you get it for free but you risk infection and a ton of pain, plus you can only blame yourself if its off centered or something.    but if your going to do it (the ol' fashioned way) you want sterilize the needle by holding the "pointy" end under a fire for about a minute, then submerging it in rubbing alcohol to cool it off and to store it until just before you pierce the ear.    then you are going to want to mark the spot of the piercing with a fine tip, but bright, pen/marker; and have a friend check to make sure the spot is correct.    You need to then sterilize your ear buy rubbing it with rubbing alcohol for like a minute. The only way to "numb" it (and this really isn't useful at all) is to hold a cube of ice on it until that is unbearable, then immediately stab the needle into your ear as hard and quick as possible! (this is important because you want to make sure you have enough momentum to go all the way through, as you are naturally going to pull back as soon as your body registers the pain!)    Sterilize your ring in the same way as the needle and quickly replace the needle for the ring in your ear.    douce the ear in hydrogen peroxide and make sure to rinse it with the solution they sell at the store, per the manufactures instruction.    good luck,    -Shamar|`|dHkvVlONaa	Don't sterilize it with a flame, that will contaminate it.  Alcohol or peroxide will do just fine.    Don't numb it, because it will only harden the skin on the outside, the only way you can numb the inside of your ear is to have a doctor use anesthetic, which he needs to stick a needle in your ear for anyway, so it kinda defeats the purpose.    The faster the better, although you don't want to do it so fast that you screw up/get it crooked.    Good luck :)|`|3OTE1t5eaa	My opinion is leave it to the professionals, but if u insist on piercing your own ears it's all explained here step by step.    http://www.ehow.com/how_2059618_pierce-o...|`|GnYw9Pvwaa	That is a really bad idea. I had a friend who tried that and had to get his ear amputated. He thought he sterilized it too. :\|`|LREo3Tjpaa	put the needle in some alcohol, put a piece of apple behind your ear and just quickly shove it in.don't numb it, they don't do that at piercing shops and plus that will just give you more time to think about it, just do it quickly|`|DtP7rwenaa	From experience when I was younger I would advise you NOT to do it cuz 99% it will get infected badly.However what you should is to sterilize the needle, your ear and your hands.all of them with pure spirit.and the some antibacterial spray. then with some ice spray or ice cube numb your ear but be careful and then stick the needle in [if the needle isnt plastic you can sterilize with fire i think].Its better to be fast.GOOD LUCK!and if u do it...............Take A GOOD CARE of it!|`|htSZsds7aa	You numb the lobe with ice, clean everything with alchol..soak it for 2-3 minutes..I used a large safety pin, its easier to grip. mark the spot on the ear where you want the hole. push needle thru firmly and steadily. It WILL hurt. Afterwards put in your all gold or stainless steel stud. use lots of neosporin 4-6 x a day, twist stud many times aday also. dont remove stud till healed..about 2 weeks.  I had mine done this way but I dont advise it.  go to a pro.|`|NIEt2CEZaa	don't do it yourself unless you actually have a piercing needle because a regular needle won't make the hole big enough and you won't be able to get the earring in. do a bunch of chores assuming you are a youngster living with your parents just clean up like crazy then ask for some money to do it at a shop.|`|G9xUwEopaa	When i pierced my own ears I sterilized the needle with rubbing alcohol and also sterilized my ears to. Then I stuck the needle through my ear slowly and then i sterilized the earrings and put them in. I didn't think it hurt at all but if your going to do your cartilage you should go to a professional don't do it yourself because it can cause cauliflower ear.
9UgGwvtlaa	well time is the best way!!    be patient    sugar and lemon scrub    vitamin e oil|`|6Rk9Vowgaa	I use Bio-Oil and also Natural Vitamin E-Oil. Use one or both twice a day. My technique sounds really strange but.....  -Make sure you have no where to go that day or night. Cut some cling film so that its big enough to wrap around the area. (ie, if its on the leg, make it big enough to wrap around the area and your leg - so it stays attached) Put loads of the oil on the scar and on some of the cling film, then put the cling film to the scarred area and wrap around so that it stays in place.   The basic idea is so that the scarred area constantly receives and absorbs the oils. Works for me lol. But remember that its harder to get rid of old scars - sometimes impossible. So start asap to get the maximum affect. As a short term measure, covering it with liquid foundation and then powder foundation can work.    Hope this works. But embrace those scars. They're a part of you  - your 'war wounds', physical proof that you can fight anything. lol.   Anyway, good luck.   Hope i helped.|`|pFS2LZGKaa	the less radical way is to exfoliate your skin twice a week or you can ask for a laser treatment|`|VdVyTjuMaa	put lotion the scares i know it sounds silly but it is true i did it once and my scares went away|`|r5oL56xCaa	sugar and lemon scrub works      just be patient, time will let it go away,     or gold bond stuff can work|`|bh4L2gK3aa	use scar serum i reccomend Cocoa Butter fomula scar serum  Its helped me alot ive used it for 2 weeks and it already reduced my scar marks|`|vWk9lcXDaa	A few weeks ago I was in CVS in the isle where they keep all of the medical stuff and I saw some lotion that can diminish the look of scars. I didn't really look that much into it, but if you to do your local pharmacy and ask them for something similar im sure they could find it.     Hope this helps

It became popular in the 90s because this was the way strippers wore theirs.  (Legally strippers cannot be totally shaved so they started making little 'designs'.)  Its basically the pubic hair equivalent of acrylic nails. :)  Some people love them.|`|Dd9Lc3tDaa	It's when they shave "down there" so there is only a little stripe of hair coming up from *cough*. yeah, hope that helps.

JZnSPgAOaa	I really LOVE Maybelline "Mineral Power" Powder. It stays on like a liquid foundation, but it's a powder so it's light and doesn't clog your pores. It also comes with concealer and liquid foundation if you wish. but if you don't have much acne, the powder will work Great(:  --Oh Yeah, and You Can Get It At Any Wal-mart|`|0IrORUzBaa	Well i use maybelline Dream Matte Mousse. It is amazing and evens your skin tone perfectly without making it orange. it runs about $10|`|5BtMv1r1aa	Any mineral powder make up is fine, & you can use stick foundation to cover up those un-wanted spots. :)|`|kMsShtwpaa	omggg i loveee lancome foundation!  seriously i swear by it, it stays on all day without touch-ups!  its a littttle bit pricey but its definatly worth it!! |`|mhyL7Qw3aa	I really like to use Rimmel London's Stay Matte foundation because it is lightweight, covers well, and evens out my skin tone (I have red areas but this foundation covers the redness well). It only costs $7 and you can buy it at any drugstore that sell Rimmel London cosmetics.|`|Flrnnme1aa	As a professional makeup artist I highly recommend bee luscious cosmetics liquid minerals or thier photo touch mineral foundation.

Because skinny jeans and converse make statements just in and of themselves, you need to make sure you don't over do it by adding a ton of jewelry or loud patterns.    Without the scarf, I like the idea of a plain white semi-fitted tee.  Nothing too tight, but not baggy either.  Also, tees with large lettering or large simple pictures (but not much pattern) are really modern looking.    http://www.polyvore.com/which_shirt/set?...|`|ucZOCMyAaa	a plain black t-shirt.
bA5FOMOBaa	wow. i lovee the dress!!!  i think lace gloves, the hat (GG :D)  and stockings would look lovely with it.  I am not sure about pearls- that might over do it. How about a simple silver/ platinum necklace- dress the rest simple   :)  but yeah i love that dress :)

APBG8bzsaa	Io col Dream Mousse di Maybelline mi trovo stra-bene! Come sfumabilit  migliore di quelli in polvere e anche come colore. E' intenso e leggermente perlato e soprattutto dura. E poi  facilmente modulabile.  Mi ci sto trovando proprio bene ^_^|`|ZXUsiO66aa	io l ho usato ma trovo migliore quello in polvere...poi la polvere  meno dannosa|`|qb6zclleaa	io uso le creme colorate  adesso sto usando quella della nivea che ho comprato al supermercato e la trovo ottima|`|DpFAWLX2aa	forse parli dll fondotinta?|`|iLZ2jKFyaa	Xk non usi una via di mezzo?

Formula cremosa, che dona una finitura luminosa e di lunga tenuta.   Scivola delicatamente sfumandosi facilmente con le sue tonalit naturali.  Mousse leggero come l'area, che lascia un velo satinato sulla pelle.  Formula a lunga tenuta, che non ostruisce i pori.     INDICAZIONI E CONSIGLI   Con la punta de le dita, applicare il fard sugli zigomi. Con piccoli movimenti sfumarlo verso le tempie.  Si consiglia di applicare inizialmente una piccola quantit di prodotto, ed aggiungere del altro, solo se necessario.     Punti forti:  Ha un'ottima consistenza, una volta steso  fantastico, colori brillanti e non troppo forti. Dura a lungo.      Punti deboli:  Non ce ne sono di partocolari.       il colore 04 -mauve magique-  bellissimo     per chi non ha mai usato fard in crema all'inizio l'applicazione potrebbe risultare un p ostica, bisogna prenderci la mano per regolarsi bene con le quantit|`|0c217a7e9e9252187b15eb764f9da598aa	Non lo so, secondo me la polvere soffoca meno la pelle, non ostruisce i pori come una crema e puoi modularne l'intensit. Dall'altra parte per ho l'impressione che un fard in crema abbia una tenuta maggiore nel tempo, quindi dipende da quali caratteristiche vuoi che abbia il tuo fard.... Ecco forse sulle pelli un po' oleose o con problemi di acne lo eviterei, su quelle normali e secche non dovrebbe dare grossi problemi se non che, ripeto, secondo me  troppo coprente.
vRU6V9ojaa	Qualsiasi frangia puo' essere bellissima,nelle capigliature femminili,a patto che si adatti a quel particolare volto e lo renda ancora piu' affascinante .  Esistono tuttavia ragazze e donne che,con la frangia,stanno malissimo, ne ho viste ,di bassa statura e tozze,che,con la frangia,sembrano schiacciate verso il basso,ancora piu' imbruttite,grottesche( devono avere uno specchio compiacente,esse non si accorgono,bevono le frottole delle false amiche che le rassicurano) .|`|KfqX8HaTaa	di lato ^^  io prima l'ho avuta su un occhio ma era scomoda...  poi corta e dritta ma non mi piaceva...  poi normale, dritta e non stava bene sul mo viso e comunque dovevo sempre star li a lisciarla...  ora ce l'ho da parte che non copra troppo l'occhio ed e molto carina!!! ^^  Anche se devo dire che ogni tanto tirare indietro i capelli non fa male ^^|`|1rzIEoQHaa	sul lato destro abbastanza corta...|`|1S0ZtFZHaa	io ho la frangia ,a me piace lunga e non dritta perfetta|`|7GnPyJnuaa	mi piace a chi a un bel viso, capelli non molto folti e liscissimi la frangia pari un po fino all'occhio!!!! ciao  http://iloveshopping.files.wordpress.com...    vabb non  proprio pari!! comunque come nella foto! :D|`|DnYziAlhaa	di lato folta ma scalata|`|oN5FB3wfaa	folta di lato nn troppo corta!|`|YokrL0Uqaa	la frangia occhio che quest'anno non va di moda!!|`|hqvjfhWXaa	se una donna e bella e bella con o senza frangia|`|h5WD0mXVaa	storta e folta..|`|MOfX5L64aa	come quella che ha Nelly Furtado in say it right|`|QmdOHt6oaa	messa davanti ke arrivi alle sopracciglia e sfilzata sotto cioe da una parte + corte poi + lunga poi di nuovo + corta...bellxx!
mxtWuadraa	To be honest, guys with dark, thick hair are much hotter than guys with a 7 year olds hair. You'll probably find that as you grew up and your hair changed, your complexion did too.. so if you dye it now, it'll probably look a little odd. But if you wanna go for it.. then do it! be prepared for roots showing through though and for redying!! good luck!!     however, i think you should stick with brunette! you sound as though you have gorgeous hair!!! don't go blonde!! or 'golden'!! loll so good luck!!!|`|0dbwA1dVaa	Most hair (and sometimes eye color) naturally darkens with age. When I was little I had bright blonde hair, and now it's dark brown.    You'll have to go to a salon. Tell them what you want and I'm sure they'll be able to help you. If the thickness of your hair is bothering you, you could have it thinned out too. As far as the wavy part goes, I really can't help you.     Good luck!

KrhotdQwaa	Il problema  quando il modo in cui ci si veste diventa l'unico metro di giudizio per valutare una persona.

You can get cheap but cute jewelery from Claire's and Accessorize.  Buy jewelery that can go with many outfits, and you can even pick out a signature necklace or bracelet that you almost always wear.    You said you liked vintage, so go to local markets on the weekend with your friends. Also browsing around in charity shops, you can find some really nice vintage stuff. But make sure you buy them good quality though, so for instance if they have a hole in them, just leave it. But if there's a button missing, don't worry, that can be sewn in and you can make it your by putting in a different button. Vintage is pretty good 'cause then you can look different without spending lots of money.    A great online store I'd recommend is Asos.com, they have really nice things and they offer really fast shipping for people in the U.K. They have everything from clothes to accessories to make-up.     Hope I helped. :)|`|AA10359193	the thing is if u want to stick out u need to have little pops of color in yo99ur clothes like if u wear a black dress wear a brought yellow belt or brought stockings hehe its cute.     and also wearing layered jewlery it never gets old|`|ROQQYp6baa	have u ever thought of dying your clothes that ur bored with?? i had to tops that were sitting in my wardrope for ages that i wasnt wearing so i dyed them purple.    what about scarfs as well since its coming in2 winter.    foir accesories, primark is really good and soemtimes u get dresses really cheap. i got one for a fiver and its really nice    |`|a6e956d64645c91c661f1a2299cfee7daa	If you like vintage, you're on to a winner.  Of course, it depends on how vintage.    Go to your mum's airing cupboard, take out a white linen sheet and drape it over one shoulder.  Next, find as many leather belts and watch straps as you can, and fasten them around your ankles (each ankle separately, otherwise you'll fall over).  Then put on a pair of ballet shoes (those cheap black plimsoles will do), then fashion a laurel wreath out of leaves from the garden (or nearest park).  You'll find that this outfit was the height of fashion in Milan (and Rome) about 2000 years ago.    Hope this helps??!!!?!!?
D8Eyu6BFaa	i think they are cute but overdone. like the victoria beckham A-line bob. if you're getting something there, get something original, like a chicken bone or something....lol...that was a joke but do make it original and meaningful. bottom line, if you like it, that's all that matters. all other opinions are just that...opinions. |`|FPpKdaIeaa	I think they look cute, depending on what the tattoo is, exactly. It looks like they would hurt way more in that spot than it would somewhere else, though lol.....|`|k7c2StfGaa	ummmmm well its a tattoo, they look horrible once u get older...... so hav a good think b4 hand. rhianna has stars nd it looks nice so i think i would hav to say cute (atleast till u get older) but wat if u change your mind nd dont want one once its done?    hope it helps nd its totally up to u|`|hPytbgWSaa	i don't think they are trashy at all. and they don't hurt as much as people think. I have a tattoo behind both ears. A clover under my right ear and a heart behind my left. |`|AA10024068	I think they're cute. I've thought about getting one behind each ear....You do whatever makes you happy, & don't care what others think...it's your body....|`|NC0tSeFSaa	cute, but only like ittle things like stars or hearts l|`|8ZhWKPyjaa	CUTE!!!|`|Doy5FIj6aa	I don't see how that would be considered trashy.|`|0e2dcf078f31fa4438e1cbf0ec8784ecaa	Cute but it entirely depends on what people get, when it's really nice caligraphy and one letter it looks nice but when its huge nautical stars it definitely looks trashy, I've seen only one I absolutely love and it was a couple of stars in different colours like the rainbow, really nice.
oVxr5B3Eaa	Ah, you'll be fine. Just remember you'll get through it.. A little pain won't kill you, it's only temporary!  It is painful. i have the tops of my feet AND working on my ribcage which are supposed to be some of the most painful places. To be honest, its not so much pain as annoyance because you can feel the vibration of the needle... With my foot I actually bit through the skin on my finger (thats how i distracted myself) and with my ribcage i swore but the worst was the ONE real tear i cried. Most of it is just like an annoying scratching, like someone dragging a sewing needle over your skin, just hard enough to scratch you, but then some is a burning, some is intense vibration that tenses all your muscles, and some feels like a hot knife digging into your skin. Sometimes one line will kill and the next right beside it wont hurt at all.   i've actually heard that upper back at the side is one of the LEAST painful. If your worried about enduring it, ask the artist to run a needle over your skin without any ink first. It does hurt, but its not horrible(ok, well iun some spots its torture, but overall, endurable). If I sat through 2 hours of ribcage tattoo without a break, you can do your upper back.     Good luck! ((Just a hint... try to concentrate on something else.. if you do a good job, you'll actually zone out and not feel anything! Some people can actually fall asleep! I actually found it harder when i brought a friend than when I went alone. its really hard to not twitch sometimes, especially once your about an hour in, your muscles start to spasm. With my friend there, every time, it was almost uncontrollable, to the point I actually made my artist mess up a bit. When I went alone, I could put my full focus on holding still and concentrating on something other than the pain. Just find something to put your energy into... Do stupid things,,, try to read things on the wall upsidedown (usually tons of artwork around to distract you), count ceiling tiles or bumps ON a cieling tile. one of my favorite passtimes is squinting at lights on the ceiling until they make weird shapes and colors. Doesn't matter what it is, but pick something and put all your energy into concentrating on it.. really helps. If you bring someone, just make sure they will keep a conversation if you want, or shut up if you want. Make sure you keep breathing, even if its hard. I always like to hold my breath and its a bad idea. Make sure you eat a decent meal before, like 2 hours before eat a good solid meal. I even found a big difference between eating at 1 for a 5pm session and eating just an apple on the way... The sooner before, the better. As long as it doesn't make you feel sick... Oh, and don't take painkillers or drink alcohol within like 24 hours before (painkillers include tylenol and advil!) They thin your blood and make you bleed more..    Ok, I think thats all I have for you.... you might want to bring a little pillow for your head (though they will usually ahve one), wear a shirt (or whatever your wearing on top) that gives lots of access to the area, or wear a bathingsuit top, and make sure your OK with getting ink on it because it doesn't always wash out. If the artist tells you you HAVE to take off your shirt (if your wearing something that gives good access to the area), thats a good time to get out of there! Some artists are really, well, creepy and will tell you you need to take off your pants for an ankle tattoo.. especially girls.... You don't have to, they only need a little room around!|`|AA10024068	I have 9 tattoo's, & I have 1 on my left & right upper back, & I'll have to say those were one of the least painful that I personally experienced...but, everyone is different, & will have different opinions...    There's really no way to truly prepare yourself, because you won't know what it feels like until the needles are actually on your skin...However, taking deep breaths in & exhaling can help. It also helps if you eat something before you get tattooed. Holding on to something also helps, & if you don't want to do that, pinching the heck out of the chair or something always helps me, haha......Along with having someone there you can talk to & distract your mind...    Tattoo's in my opinion are painful, but it's something you can tolerate, & afterwards they'll become very addicting, lol....The pain is very much worth it in the end!     Good luck!|`|eGypHHQiaa	it's painful but not intolerable. i wouldn't worry about feeling the pain and then telling them to stop, that never really happens. i got one on my upper back and it hurt like a constant bee stinging and scraping. it's like scratching a sunburn. but when i got one on my lower stomach i thought it would kill but it tickled! i hear the most painful places to get them are the top of the foot- due to all the bones, the inside of the upper arm- soft baby flesh, and the ribs- due to ribs haha. i think the back is a great place for a beginner to start! good luck!|`|SqlT7CgAaa	expect the unexpected.      The feeling of constant bee sting, burning is a good example . just sit tight squeeze your fist or something, don't wanna jump around and mess it up. i don't think there is a less painful place. I've heard different answers from everybody. that's because everybody is different and every tattoo is different in size and coloring. Just make sure you get what you want and where you want it. |`|kAahOUhkaa	None of my three really hurt too bad (neck, wrist, hip)  Sometimes it feels like a scratching, sometimes it burns, if it hits a bone you'll want to rip something apart. haha  Do something that will distract you. My first tattoo i read the same magazine article about 10 times while i was getting it done.   I also get a little light headed so it helps to take along a tube of cake icing in case you do. it brings your blood sugar back up. trust me, it helps.

I think in todays society alternative styles have become so accepted that you can do pretty much what ever you want. Having said that I personally think wo studs look a bit chav-tastic and am much more into the dark side of piercing (stretching) lol.

GNtsdk4saa	Are you cleaning it twice a day and keeping your pants and stuff off of it?  Make sure you move the ring around a lot when you are cleaning to get the solution inside.  I used betadine both times I had mine done (long story...).  It should be a little red still, but if it starts to spread at all, head to the doctor.|`|ylgNuE3uaa	Go back to where you got it pierced (or if you had a friend do it, GO TO A Piercing parlor ANYWAY) and ask them to take a look at it. They are the best people to ask.    We can't make a great assesment without 1. seeing it, 2. being a piercer or 3. being a doctor.    Have you been cleaning it regularly as prescribed by the piercer??

326cbca68b47a1548c365218823fc82caa	I have been teaching myself over the last couple of years. It's not a quick thing to learn, necessarily, but it is very rewarding.     I have to warn you that it isn't really cheaper to make your own clothes than it is to buy things in shops like Primark and New Look, where they buy fabric in bulk and get things sewn in the Far East. Decent fabric isn't cheap, and all the extra bits - thread, buttons, zips, etc all add up. However, making your own clothes DOES mean you get something that is exactly what you want, is different to what everyone else is wearing, and fits you properly. And you get the nice feeling of knowing that you've made it all yourself.     I started by buying a basic sewing machine and the cheapest fabric I could find on the market, and practising things like sewing straight lines and corners and hems, before I made an actual garment. I think the first thing I made was a really basic A line skirt, from a basic pattern (get the ones labelled EASY to start with!) with cheap fabric from the market. The first time I tried to follow a pattern I thought I might die, it was so complicated. But with patience and perseverance, I did it, and it all worked, and I ended up with a very wearable skirt.  The second skirt I made was much neater, and much better.  I still haven't made anything more complicated than skirts and aprons and handbags, but I am far more confident than I was, and my next project is going to be a dress, I think, as I find dresses impossible to buy for my shape/size.     I love sewing clothes, it's a very enjoyable and rewarding process, and I love walking around knowing that I'm wearing something that I've made myself and that is a total one-off.     Some of the things I've made are here:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/ginger_elan...    And a very good sewing forum that has some great ideas and lots of advice:  http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php...      Good luck!  Sewing clothes is a great hobby.|`|hj952SLyaa	just go primark|`|xlFVqLEaaa	ask your mum, grandma or some kind of relative   they'll know how to|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	Well, you might be able to find a cheap / free sewing or dressmaking course at your local community college.

YUshhmmRaa	Uncut diamond will be definitely cheaper than a cut diamond for various reasons. First one, you can't really tell the color or clarity of the diamond for sure before its cut and polish so you'll be getting an almost a closed box. Second the labor for cutting and polishing is quiet expensive specially on larger and fancy shaped diamonds.    I would estimate if a 1.00 ct middle range round diamond averages for 5000.00 retail you should be able to get a 1.00ct rough diamond for around 500.00 to 1000.00 depending on its shape, color, etc. of course keep in mind that if one day you decide to get it cut and polished then the diamond will almost loose more than half of its weight depending on the shape and you will have to pay for sawing, cutting and polishing which will cost a bunch.    I do my shopping from a store which was referred to me by my best friend. Then often have great deals on diamonds and jewelry also they are flexible with custom work. You can chat online with a diamond specialist for more info on rough diamonds and their pricing.    http://www.shenoadiamonds.com    Also visit the following two sites to get even more detailed info:    http://www.diamondrough.com/    http://www.roughdiamondworld.com/default...|`|xlFVqLEaaa	go to a jewellers and ask.   They'll tell you and probably show you some|`|jrB6z23Yaa	Probably some 15000 INR.    Dhruvika  http://www.myjewelersplace.com|`|HdbVkGQdaa	www.SkyFacet.com
Jvvbt85jaa	I like them! It depends what you wear them with though. I would wear them with like a relaxed/hippie look.|`|biheycXqaa	Yay! They're so cute on Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus!  And guys wear them too! (Joe Jonas in 2007.... no lie)|`|6QGa33pAaa	NAY.  personally, i think they look hideous.|`|nPce7KuHaa	Yay!!!|`|BZewDqNMaa	Personally I think they are adorable! Only if done the right way. Your hair must look good and if your gonna do the whole boho/ hippy thing then do it full out and do it throught your outfit too. Just make sure you don't look cheesy. But one thing I hate is when emo/scene people do it! It's ugly and they look like fools!
JR3UxWYEaa	I got mine off ebay 3 years ago for mine, it was floor length and a satin lilac/gold with gold lace/embellishment detail on the neck REALLY unusual, absolutely STUNNING and it only cost 80 dollars.

Have one custom made!|`|pC2jGRKraa	Well there are lots of options:    Big money: Spend 1000+ on a designer ball gown. Guaranteed glamour.    Small money: Buy a pattern and make the dress yourself, then customise it.    Buy an ordinary, and relatively plain dress for not too much, and customise it.    Go to a charity shop and buy a designer dress, that some rich person doesn't want after one wearing.    Get a any dress and make the most using your accessories.|`|4Yw6qKyAaa	boohoo.com  oasis?  think out of the box ;)  xx|`|VZudmlOoaa	asos.com    They have amazing dresses, and change their stock all the time :)  x|`|wdNRRgphaa	jovani   faviana>online sites.    also go to finsbury park in london. its a whole street full of dresses. you cant go wrong|`|jSi8323Oaa	Jessica McClintock. She has amazingly beautiful dresses|`|tMql8eDKaa	I dunno where to get one where no one else will have one, you would have to look in some shops, but a suggestion would be lipsy, its a really nice range of formal wear, its in bank and in the next catalogue. It has really nice prom dresses in rich colours. Hope this helps. x|`|WKA1rBa5aa	Have a good look round on the internet, especially sites like ebay that have vintage unique items. or perhaps visit some boutique, vintage bespoke shops. even maybe buy a dress you quite like and do it up yourself, i.e. embellishing it, adding more tailoring. I recently took one of my mum's old dresses sewed a few glamorous buttons on, elasticated the bottom for a tulip shape.. little things like that can really transform things.

t2LOcPkLaa	my suggestion is to ask your friends what they're wearing. you don't want to be the only one in a tiny dress when everyone else is wearing ball gowns, or vice versa. david's bridal also has prom dresses, i'd suggest going there (jc p is kind of lame...). i'd suggest nothing too poofy, but something that's kind of fun. something that makes you feel like a princess, not just a lame monochromatic silk dress. of course the mask is an important part as well. they sell them at party stores, or you can find a nice one online.|`|KgwHBGg3aa	you can always get it online this site has tons of pretty dresses but there kinda pricey    http://www.serendipityprom.com/
xEoR8igxaa	You seem like a smart guy. Be more creative. Depending on where you want to do this (a formal dinner party, for example), you could start with a pair of normal pants (maybe get them used at Salvation Army or another thrift store if money is a concern).     1) Take a pair of scissors and cut down the seams on both legs.     2) Sew strips (inch thick) of durable fabric (nylon would work) down both seams on both legs.     3) Now sew your velcro to the nylon on both legs, and reattach (buy the pants slightly baggy, because you'll need overlap the fabric to close it up).     4) Walk into said dinner party wearing a seemingly normal outfit, then freak-out the establishment by tearing your pants off while the host is thanking everyone for coming. You will instantly become the envy of your friends.|`|fFObxgxuaa	I would say most definitely go with velcro.    male strippers usually have special tear away pants. they come off like a magic trick.    will you tear them off for me?? I love a good pants tearing show!!  I'll wear my tear away socks!!|`|mimykKnhaa	those snap button thingys|`|UHip02Gxaa	Snap pants - make sure you wear them a few times to loosen up the snaps.  I think Adidas still makes them.|`|DvSuHNV8aa	Velcro would give you a nice ripping sound...|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	for quick and easy i would go with the velcro, buttons would take too long =)|`|R7mxReqcaa	Nike makes them I believe, button ones work ok but after awhile start to rip thru the fabric|`|LFoHH9Noaa	button-down. if your pulling from the top, the velcro from the middle down will not come undone. button-down is your best choice|`|2j84hXguaa	I create mine from paper mache.  They are easy to tear off, but the only risk I have found is mexican immigrant children will beat you with a stick, expecting candy to fly out.|`|yDY66mEKaa	velcro|`|c2w2vJJpaa	probably best with the pop-buttons, but use velcro if you want the noise|`|GKQJRJAMaa	Button downs. They are much easier to rip off|`|0dbwA1dVaa	Button down! I've had some friends (jokingly) experiment with ripping their pants off. The buttons definitely worked! It was awesome.    As far as companies... you may try Nike? You may also try sports stores at the mall or around town.|`|z7ivcj8Maa	velcro tends to get stuck so the quick effect you will not have go with snaps also try looking online in stripper wear they have some good ones made just for that since i dont work for them i will not include names sorry|`|QCLKSVsRaa	Button....try Nike!

nctlGcujaa	its not a very nice style to be honest but i think you would need to do la few very loose curls with curling irons and use serum to give it a smooth texture.  xxx|`|mIj958p1aa	zomg it looks really cool duuuuuude xD|`|xeBbTKHuaa	like you are going to look hot but im blonde so listen how to do it with the smart people      = ]  lool|`|AA11438281	curls, would help.  layers.  you need layers, chunky layers.    but honestly, this is a really girly style|`|qDVtNWOlaa	tease your hair a bit look it up on youtube to tease hair  to get the messy look i like it
uNlXmOSKaa	Agora eu pergunto a vc...  Se a metade (ou maioria) dos participantes fossem negros, a maioria dos brasileiros assistiriam ao programa com o mesmo entusiasmo?? Claro que n?o!! E alm do mais, estes mesmos hipcritas que falam "o programa deveria ter mais negro", seriam os primeiros a fazerem piadinhas ou a deixarem de assistir ao BBB.    A Globo s est cumprindo com o papel dela, que  a de dar aquilo que o povo pede, gosta de ver (ou de se iludir). Reflete a realidade de nosso pas, que  a de velar o preconceito ou tolerar aquele que  considerado fora dos padr?es de beleza. Eu n?o disse aceitar, mas tolerar, pq tem muita gente que n?o gosta de um determinado biotipo e com as leis contra discrimina??o, muita gente tolera seu preconceito.     O povo pede tanto por igualdade e menos discrimina??o, mas a maioria pede aquilo que acha mais bonito de se ver... Pode ter contedo ou n?o, mas pede e gosta.   Veja que em todas as edi??es a maioria dos participantes s?o sulistas, loiros e "brancos". UM negro, mesti?o ou gordo, por programa ou em nenhum.  Esta edi??o nova do BBB, para cumprir seu papel de "emissora-que-luta-pela-cidadania" colocou UM negro, UMA nordestina, DUAS nortistas e DOIS idosos - isto depois do povo pedir por "igualdade" e reclamar por n?o coloc-los nas edi??es anteriores.  E ainda tem gente que depois diz "A, depois dizem que a Globo discrimina". Pobres iludidos e ignorantes!!! J est?o t?o alienados e iludidos que mal conseguem enxergar como s?o manipulados...    Negro no Brasil, ainda  visto por alguns como objeto sexual ou coitadinho que implora por cotas e que vive lutando pelos direitos de igualdade. Mas as pessoas esquecem que o negro  t?o humano quanto qualquer um "branco".|`|5cf00a884145fa12979b14aded2a3fa0aa	Verdade cara, o preconceito  evidente no BBB.    Em todos os BBBs que j tiveram, eles colocam apenas uns 02 negros por edi??o apenas cara, geralmente uma mulher um homem, como voc disse, apenas pra dizer que n?o tem.|`|TFoOCxalaa	A verdade  q o sistema exclui os negros da mdia, os prpios negros no fundo n?o querem ver negros no BBB, n?o  racismo da Globo, como  um programa que tem q ter uma audincia alta, s?o feitas pesquisas de preferncia e comportamento dos telespectadores indicado aquilo q as pessoas querem assistir|`|iF4SN29Taa	preconceito, claro. os caras poderiam ate colocar mais negros no programa, mas os brancos provavelmente levariam a melhor. por tanto, pra disputa ficar "interessante" e dar ibope, eles agradam o publico e colocam mais brancos.    mas como preconceito  crime, eles colocam uns negros nas edi??es (sim, poucos) pra que as pessoas n?o possam dizer que negros nunca entram na casa|`|eAbLyMI2aa	Falam mal mais pagam pal!!!    H quem ame o programa, h quem odeie e h, principalmente, aqueles que dizem que odeiam, mas n?o conseguem ficar sem falar no assunto.

Ah?.|`|rvesM6X9aa	olha meu amigo o BBB  uma B.........a! eu n?o gosto, por esse e mais alguns motivos,  uma ilus?o, falsidade pura!|`|udkV9mFVaa	concorco o  proconceito  evidente, na verdade eles so selecionam pessoa de classe MEDIA baixa ou alta em geral todos bonitos!    por que n?o dar chances a gordinhos ou pessoas de baixa renda?|`|btkAQJrLaa	Infelizmente  assim mesmo. Se tiver mais de um l, o programa perder audincia.      Mas, pra falar a verdade, d nojo em ouvir falar de BBB, e foi so pra dizer isto q entrei aki.  Mas, tambm respondi sua pergunta.|`|ZnzGWWstaa	pois  n cara fazer o que o brasil que escolhe assim!|`|MkGXvNoqaa	Simples,   a audincia caro amigo!   Eles n?o est?o preocupados com nada, s com a audincia.    Por que eles n?o colocam gordinhos?  Por que n?o colocam pobres?      MALDITA GLOBO!  MALDITO BBB!   tenho nojo disso!|`|2a02d70bbe81f8a222ca14f0f60d9d90aa	tbm notei isso...pra mim isso  preconceito, mas de uma forma discreta, ignorancia num grau maior. beijos|`|7dbce6da70fe92dadd37d6fb25f6bad7aa	e entram estes dois por conta da cota negra!     triste mais  verdade o preconceito pode estar camuflado mais de vez em quando ele se revela e nos atira na cara!    abra??o!
m2vBJaHKaa	go to google asnd type that ;)|`|qRZB5UaLaa	I think you should try something that will enhance your curves, this is a really sexy look so something that will put the focus on your upper half of your body will be best.    Stay clear of anything that hides the curves as this is your top asset.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Sheer black teddy.

JkoywYrPaa	ABSOLUTELY!|`|HffjAUrfaa	Yep,  I would love to just get up and go to school without having to do my hair and makeup :P  But ya know  :P  (Y)  xx|`|dPULl5hjaa	of course    plastic surgery, botox juvederm, etc. - who couldn't look better?|`|e0IFrVyfaa	Yes|`|GWB1R0jQaa	YES. Definitely. Look at all the damage it's doing! People with eating disorders, people with no money, no friends, no life other than fashion, etc.    I love the lyrics of the song "Anticonformity";    Image is overrated   If it washes away in the rain  You know you've gotta go deeper  To go against the grain|`|mvAgLB9laa	Absolutely - that's why so many people put their pics up here looking to see if they are pretty or hot. Everyone wants to fit in and be good looking.|`|IbI487CYaa	Definitely and we have no one to blame but ourselves. We, as a people, tend to judge a book by its cover even though we are told not to. IF we see someone with dirty clothes we think they are dirty and do not want to be anywhere around them. Also, we tend to bully people who are not good looking and tear them down until they feel that the only way to be treated like a person is to go under the knife. It is sad how much appearance is important but it's the world we live in. It is so bad that there was a study stating good looking people earn more than average-looking and ugly people and are more likely to get promoted (http://watsoninc.blogspot.com/2008/02/do...|`|xsifsRUUaa	Ha! Of course! But that's life :/|`|oCMrcnu0aa	Yes.  Good point.  We do seem to promote window-dressing at the expense of substance.  The pressure only works if we buy into it and allow it to work and I suppose it will continue to do so until we recognise that the most attractive quality of a person is their mind and that those who dine-out on their looks or their wardrobe may not be the most desirable companions in life.|`|hnhb119Laa	This isn;t what you want to hear, but I say absolutely not.  Walk through any typical mall in america, or down any city street, and it is obvious that most people don't focus nearly enough on their appearance.  It's pathetic.  What you look like onthe outsde is absolutely a reflection of who you are on the inside.  If you are a slob, you are a slob.  It takes so little effort to look decent, and most poeple don't even do that much.  A third of all Americans are OBESE.  Not overweight - OBESE.|`|0fE4qkPyaa	Yes!  I try to have my own style.and i like being natural.  I hate blending in.  And i hate the trends.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Deffinately.|`|GGUDvicaaa	YES! Taking care of  looks is great, but many  people and world of entertainment are shallow and sleazy, running after "right" thin and sexy body type... and condoning sewermouthed weightbigots!|`|GKJEgidzaa	Not really, people can chose wether or not they want to express themselves through image. Nothing wrong with it.|`|SRVXka9Iaa	YES so much  tbh it doesn't even matter how you look|`|SUR1MHqWaa	yes you are what you are too many people are pressurised into looking a particular way|`|KdiqIpIxaa	Hell Yes!  But, im not really forced to make myself look nice.   Im just that type of girl.  Not pressurised. Just love to look presentable.|`|xXEFvl8Naa	do bears excrete in the woods.|`|6uRWoIjJaa	Yes, i think it is awful that we should all be thin and look the same size etc.   Another awful thing, when i was recently working in a nursery which cared for children after school, a young girl came in all upset one day saying older girls were being nasty calling her rude names as she was a little bit bigger than children in her class (she was quite tall). Its awful that a five year old should worry about their looks and general size when they should be free to enjoy thier childhood without fear of what others say.|`|SFjdd6WLaa	Yes, people put way too much emphasis on looks rather than intellect.  But it's been that way for thousands of years.  That's why you don't see ancient sculptures of overweight ugly people.  In modern society, one only needs to look at a commercial to see what we hold to be the norm.  Tall, handsome, beautiful, and fit to run a marathon.  Since millions of people watch TV, then that image is what people are expecting to see. That's why the diet, fitness, and hair coloring industries aren't laying anyone off.|`|AlafsnL9aa	Absolutely not.  Image is very important. Of course it's what kind of person you are that really matters, but people really do underestimate just how much of a difference your look can make.    You feel different when you're wearing a stunning red dress as opposed to when you're wearing a loose T-shirt and baggy jeans. You'd feel different if you a leather jacket with 'Rock and Roll' stiched across the front as opposed to if you were wearing your hair in a bun and you had a formal suit on.    And other people feel differently about you when you're wearing these same things. It's a fact that most people have already made up their mind about what kind of person you are before you even speak one word. They decide based on how you look, your body language, etc.    You don't dress for a party when you're going to work and you don't dress for work when you're going to a party. People will think you're not serious enough in the first instance, or too serious in the second instance.|`|OgQOVsxPaa	Sadly yes :(
JbSebJJYaa	Wear something funky but nothing too warm. If you dance a lot like most people then you will get hot ! Just look colorful and have fun !|`|0fE4qkPyaa	Not much!    a tank top and a skirt will do.|`|pHmKGLMoaa	Everyone at raves looks like an idiot.  You need to dress like one too so you blend in.|`|H5wl4kqvaa	Something light because it gets hot in there, also bright neon colors, animal prints, neon beads, funky jewelry, and so cute shoes. Don't take a purse thou, I knew a guy that would steal belongings from people that were high or to busy to notice they left their belongings. I would maybe find a black and white zebra tank top because the blue light is on sometimes
AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist.    There are very light foundations out there. It would have been better if you had stated what type of coverage or type of foundation you were looking for.    Powder always tends to be lighter than liquids, even if they have the same number or color name. So I would say you would have best luck with them. There are a lot of powder foundations that are very light and may be just right for your skin color. If you prefer liquid, opt for a sheerer liquid and get the lightest shade they offer.    Here's a list of foundations to look into:    Mac's Studio Fix Powder ($26):  Shades N3 and C2 are very very light.  http://www.maccosmetics.com/templates/pr...    Mac's Mineralize Powder or Mineralize Skinfinish ($25-$29):  Light looks very pale to me, see for yourself.  http://www.maccosmetics.com/templates/pr...    Benefit Some Kind of Gorgeous ($28):  Creme to powder that comes in a very light sheer shade.  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...    Stila Illuminating Powder Foundation ($28):  VERY light shades, see "10 Watts"..  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...    Shiseido Makeup Compact Foundation or Makeup Stick ($28.50-36):  Shade B20 is extremely light.  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...    Coastal Scents Honey Matt Foundation ($21.50):  Their "fair" shade seems very light and they do not use talc, bismuth, corn starch, preservatives or fragrance.  http://www.coastalscents.com/cfwebstore/...    Calvin Klein Infinite Matte Foundation ($32):  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...      Mac Pro offers more shades, including whites, but if you don't live near a Mac Pro Store, you need to call the Mac Pro hotline to order at 1-800-866-6464. This is what they offer:  ~ Hyperreal Pressed Powder in Super White, Extra Light or Light:  http://www.macpro.com/templates/products...      If all of these are out of your price range, you can try these drug store foundations (although I cannot attest that they will work for you):    Revlon Beyond Natural Color Adjusting Foundation:  It goes on white and is suppose to self-adjust to your skin color.  http://www.revlon.com/ProductCatalog/Pro...    If none of these options work, I suggest going to a makeup counter and see if they can solve your problem!    Hope this Helps, and Good Luck!! :)|`|0F8hauikaa	Almay makes one called Color Smart that is supposed to be white and self-adjust to your skin tone, however, I haven't tried it. You might try searching for reviews of the product before buying.|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	Ok so CVS has this Liquid Oil Free Make up and I bought it for a project but I accedently bought Porcelan Ivory it is really pale and I thinki ts would be good for you its like 3 bucks!|`|r4xRkqzdaa	if you are buying your makeup from the drugstore or walmart, chances are slim you are going to be able to find a match on the really light or really dark sides of the spectrum    i am also SUPER pale and i found my perfect color match with MAKEUP FOREVER HD FOUNDATION    it makes my skin look flawless, never clogs my pores and blends and build perfectly.  i would go to a nice cosmetic store like sephora or macy's and get color matched by a professional... even tho i found somethign that worked for me, you may not have the same undertones i have in my skin.    if you are trying to go PALER than your natural skin tone don't do it...only buy foundation that perfectly matches you skin tone- never, ever, ever darker of lighter than ur natural color|`|BKG2EPz1aa	white out       hahaha sorry, I'm laughing because I have very pale skin too.

MAC stores and Sephora will help you with this, too.|`|NbeEeO6Saa	i think ivory is more orange to be honest. if you want to find out the best shade of foundation to use i think you should go to one of the consults in a shop like in boots   tell them that you are having trouble finding the right shade and they should help you.  or you could try this  http://avonshop.co.uk/product/make-up/yo...  it is supposed to adapt to your skin tone  and this  http://avonshop.co.uk/product/bargains/r...  and then just add you blush for your final touch  hope this helped|`|aBs579jdaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out several products.This is a good review website at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and read the reviews.|`|xyJ5fXL1aa	Being a Snow White beauty is a blessing and a curse, ain't it!?  LOL    I am extremely fair as well and have found a few lines that carry shades that are lighter than most other brands:    Calvin Klein now has foundation with an impressive selection of lighter colors (sold at Sephora)  Gosh Cosmetics from Denmark makes a very light foundation color called 'Porcelain' (sold at Shoppers Drug mart if you live in Canada like me)  Clinique isn't too bad for lighter shades (depending in yours)  Make Up Forever in the HD formulas have some lighter shades (sold at Sephora and some Sears locations)  Prescriptives will make your foundation for you right on the spot for your coloring.  I've tried this myself and loved the color, but not the coverage for my skin.  It's a little expensive, but you get a large bottle and the coloring is exactly you.  They also make a matching powder for you as well. Probably the best bet for color matching if you can't find anything you like from my other suggestions above. Check them out online to read up on what they do.  In my city they are only at the Holt Renfrew department store so you'll want to see where the nearest counter is in your area. (www.prescriptives.com...I think)    I am currently using the Loreal Bare Naturale mineral foundation in their lightest color (can't recall the shade  )...I am actually quite impressed with it both with color and coverage/staying power. You might like it too.    You can also try a tinted moisturizer to see if the subtle coloring in these products will work for you.  Keep in mind that it's a very sheer level of coverage....not for covering acne, etc.      When you are fair it's a real challenge to find the right foundation color - I believe it's harder than for ethnic skins because there is no line devoted to the fairer skin tones. More and more lines are coming out that tailor specifically to the darker shades.  Which is great, but we aren't fully addressed either. Being very pale is just as difficult as being very dark.    Good luck with your search. It'll be trial and error to find what works but don't give up!

JbSebJJYaa	I like hot rollers. And you can get them in any size - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|3vxEXXeUaa	hot rollers are way better i think and are less work in my opinon.
ximWtKVuaa	try using a color cast and then adding highlights
JbSebJJYaa	It's not going to turn really red and might not do anything at all. I would lighten it just a little bit so the red will have something to hold onto. You will need to use a red shampoo and conditioner if you want it to last (:       - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|pXTUMTdEaa	the more you dye it, the more it will show as it strips your hair.....|`|rNNvAcq4aa	you will see a tint of the color the first time you die it, as you keep dying it, yes the color will show. [ if you have neverr dyed your hair before it will show up in the first dye]|`|bfMx7uTjaa	it will show up the first time you do it but it'll only be noticable in the sun first but if you dye it the second time it'll show up a lot.. if you want a more natural lok but have the color in it just do it once... if you want the whole thing and just have it pop then do it twice then...    :]|`|7KZOOkYYaa	This depends on how many times you have already dyed it. If you are still with your natural color then you will probably see a huge difference the first time you try it. But, if you've been all over the color wheel with your hair, it will take some time, the first time will be subtle, but you will see some what of color change. Good Luck!|`|z3QsWmzpaa	when you first dye it will only be noticeable under direct sunlight but if you dye it again it should be noticeable in any light hope i helped =]
NbeEeO6Saa	depends if i feel like putting it on.  and sometime i will have black others brown or plum,  whatever mood i'm in when i get up!|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	Yeah, I look like CRAP without it!|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Not every day just some days. It can be quite awkward to remove.|`|pmHLkEhaaa	Most days if i go out.    but if its a doss day i wear no make up.   my eyes look naked with out it haha|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	Omg I looove eyeliner it brings out and outlines your eyes and yes I kinda do look wierd without it!|`|1zy9ckbzaa	No, at work I don't wear any.

For my office job, I feel that it is a bit too much.|`|6Zf8K3PAaa	umm. yes like everyday- it makes my eyes look better(:  i wear navy eyeliner(: xx|`|VV5KZjGRaa	I wear eyeliner everyday apart from sundays when I put on my baggiest tracksuit, don't straighten my hair or bother with any makeup as I tend to chill out and walk my dogs =)    I think eyeliner suits me, don't go OTT with it though x|`|AA11447210	If I'm going out of the house (work, shopping, etc) I typically wear some pencil eyeliner just below my bottom lashes, clear mascara, and some tinted lip moisturizer.    That's my typical makeup regime other than if I'm getting dolled up for a special occasion. Eyeliner is a staple in my makeup kit. It's a little thing that can dramatically change your look.|`|GKJEgidzaa	No not everyday, Some days I don't wear any makeup, I think its bad for your skin to cake it on everyday.    I wear eye liner mainly if Im going on a night out, sometimes during the day I just line my top lid... and keep everything else simple and fresh.    Cliche, but, less truly is more.|`|Xhivbo6zaa	Yeah but I don't wear eyeliner when I'm ill.|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	I can't wear it everyday because after a couple of hours at the computer, I rub my eyes and there goes my eyeliner.|`|OfUje9r8aa	yea i wear it most days except sundays wen i go wiv out makeup!|`|9IH2Hdlqaa	Depends what look I'm going for.  If I fancy a more natural look I just wear mascara and no other eye make up.  When I was 17 I did go through a phase of wearing heavy black liner everyday though.|`|3y8YIs3raa	yep i dooooo :]|`|BJ7WUkhVaa	yeah i think i look nasty without it|`|SUR1MHqWaa	no not at all tho it does look good|`|1CBUU7QWaa	Yes almost everyday :)|`|pN3Q4IMOaa	i dont wear it everyday :)|`|K2dxDdyqaa	I look dead without it :P|`|bTYIIrpbaa	I wear gray eyeliner as it isnt as dark as black and doesn't make my face look pale but it looks looks like im wearing eyeline ;) I think it suits me :)   and i have had compliments so yay lol ;)   If you are looking for grey and black eyeliner then Rimmel London rocks. :) x|`|lBRud4y5aa	I manage quite well without it. If I ever get round to wearing it I hope my wife will shoot me.|`|ObxU6FVmaa	yes, i look like ive been crying if i dont|`|6uRWoIjJaa	I work with children and think its inappropriate to wear makeup around them plus it would get messed up.|`|5R1dxH9eaa	YES|`|ne2sEeLJaa	I never used to, but ever since I started wearing it, I feel I look weird without it. So yes I do wear it everyday, on college days or when I'm going out.    My Mum and lots of other people say it suits me a lot, So why not?.    The only way for me to be able to put it on is keep the eyeliner pencil in your jeans/ trouser pocket for a while, as the warmth from your body makes the eyeliner more creamy like and easier to go on.    Hope this helps. x-D|`|LYO0Y8lHaa	not everyday. now and again i do, sometimes i just cant be bothered lol.|`|QqXMWpVxaa	I don't wear it everyday, because it starts to hurt my eyes. Yes i think it does suit me. xx|`|eyJHcoz7aa	Yeah , i couldn't go out without it .|`|wwewpTWDaa	Yeah, I love to look dramatic and try out loads of colours!|`|FpEUkqhfaa	Yeah and yeah    Give me best answer dude :P:P|`|uAt5NIk6aa	yeah i where eyeliner everyday, as well as mascara and cover up.  i try to apply it light, because i brake out easily.    just make sure you use make up remover every night to clean it off because its not good to sleep with on.    I hope this helps!|`|UqIzdMSOaa	not everyday normally if i going out or something like that yeah i think it does suit me. :] xxx|`|QRbCnBgFaa	i don't even know how the hell you have to use it, i just smudge it all over ma face and then look like a flippin` weirdo.    paaahh!    ?|`|csmpYDfHaa	Yes i love my eye liner it's a must have everyday !  Jet black Avon - Lasts all day without having to re-apply !!    Yup , deffo suits me - I look rough without it lol.|`|Jk9jPNeLaa	Yeah I wear eyeliner pretty  much everyday because I love it! I think that eyeliner makes anyone and everyone look better. it opens your eyes more and draws more attention to them while looking great.     i use Prefect Blend - its the best!|`|MAaub5YUaa	Well I don't wear makeup every day but most of the time when i wear makeup i will wear eyeliner. If i don't have a lot of time to do my makeup i will wear white eyeliner to brighten up my eyes. Hope this helps!|`|THKwNaU9aa	Yes, I love eyeliner so much I don't wear mascara much b/c my eyelashes are too long but the eyeliner makes my hazel/green eyes pop. :)|`|CjKPwJGvaa	yeah mostly.
rlXGRjAHaa	I would say your hip. It will hurt, but I think that would look better there, than you back, just because it is so danty. I would pick the coloring that you want as well, so it makes it more your own.|`|Qc2VO9G9aa	Hip, it would look good on your hip.|`|ZtMUZ6ryaa	ohh! that's pretty! i would def. get it on the side of your lower back! i just think  it would look alot better there! hope i helped!!!good luck!   :)|`|BJskRq6eaa	HIP !

A lot depends on body type and size.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	Hip so no one can see it its ugly as hell and black.Wtf.|`|ypQGG9hnaa	Your opiion is always the most important : ) but if it were me, I would put something like that on my hip. If you added something to make it longer and more balanced I would maybe put that on my lower back. Just a suggestion!|`|rOj4B5QNaa	does the location matter?  it's still a tramp stamp none the less no matter where it is located.  tramp stamps came about because girls were all getting the same unoriginal tattoo the second they turned 18.  all the artists in my shop still call anything of that nature a tramp stamp.  Believe me when I tell you I have nothing against butterflies either, just the big black butterfly with tribal.  go custom and you won't regret it!|`|i4UeicOmaa	You're getting the exact tattoo as someone else? How original.    ps- side of lower back.|`|6kxWMPEQaa	ok before you worry about where to get it, I would work with your tattoo artist to take that picture and come up with something similar but different and try to incorporate something meaningful to you in it.  Otherwise your just getting a tattoo that who knows how many other people already have.  And then once you have the tattoo worry about where to put it.|`|L4BFp2mNaa	not to discourage you but if you plan to have kids some day your hips and lower back will stretch. but it would look better on a hip|`|ztug2gLjaa	on your hip...there really sexy there!
Qc2VO9G9aa	If you have white hair, it might turn out another color, if you do the box there i a bigger chance of that happening.  Go to a hair dresser and talk to them about it, there might be something they can do so it won't a odd color.|`|iroXggvLaa	Hmm well that's a big change   Well I would advice that you do it proffesionally becasue they know what they are doin and they'll make it the shade. You want   Because sometime if you do it from the box you. Might miss a few spots and it will have different shades|`|Twq7efhQaa	Yes it will turn out brown.  However do not choose any browns with red tones in it. choose a brown like golden brown and I promise this will work.|`|ximWtKVuaa	be careful when you dye it ... you don't want the magic marker look|`|JbSebJJYaa	It depends on if your hair is naturally blonde or if you bleach it. I would go to a salon and let them analyze is since everyones hair is not the same (:    - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|1NO10YfPaa	Depends upon how much natural red you have in your hair and what shade of brown you color it.|`|myUpKcoEaa	Dont go straight to brown!!! Get a really bright red colour, then after washing the red out, then use the desired shade of brown.    This will prevent colour fade after a few washes.    Remember to condition with a deep treatment to keep the new colour lovely and shiny :)

Vm9JQ6zSaa	I think the dress/ tunic is cute with the boots. I think that it will look better with a pair of dark blue skinny jeans. I would wear a cream, ivory or neutral color tunic underneath.|`|ba7a44b7d91af5fa55ba04e5e48f373faa	you could probably ware a shirt that is the same color as the leggings and the boots are ok but i would ware something different.but that is not because it looks slutty,that is just my opinion.|`|peQtVOLhaa	white but i dont think that it needs a shirt|`|VrjF986Aaa	first of all, that dress/tunic thing is really slutty looking no matter how you slice it, you should lose it all together  also the brown top and the brown boots is too much brown. try matching something else with the boots  and if you wore brown leggings then, well that would be way way wayyyy too much brown, not cool  just lose the dress all together, those boots are cute tho wear them with a hippie - ish sun dress or something with a floral print|`|bVRgrvDbaa	No! That would not be cute!! The boots are very cute! You can totally wear those w/ a cute jean skirt or a sundress!   The dress is not very cute in general, but if you already have it, keep it in closet!|`|hEFFg1hHaa	the leggings would be too much brown for the boots and dress  and it doesn't seem like you need a shirt under other than that  it looks great!|`|xJfVrAD7aa	maybe add some color to it. It seems a little brown for me!
c5anDswjaa	I was pretty young when I had one by my nose removed, so I dont remember what kind of doctor I went to, I want to say a regular doctor? All they did was give me a numbing shot, got a scalpel, and cut it off.. Only 3 or 4 little stitches.. It left a scar, but not a real noticable one.. Its no biggie, just go get that sucker cut off!|`|6K1D6Azmaa	I suggest you go to a dermatologist. He will refer you to a plastic surgeon if he thinks the scarring will be too noticeable. ?|`|YCnDnHh5aa	I went to my regular doc and had a mole removed.  It does leave a scar, but it is nice to have it gone.
r4i7xPnMaa	Well, if you go to a counter, I know that there's a fifty dollar flat fee, and it is redeemable in products. But if you go to a store, I believe there's a fifty dollar fee and it isn't redeemable in products.    I have had my makeup done at MAC twice. I went to a counter both times. Once with an appointment, once without (and I was extremely lucky that they could squeeze me in). It came out great both times, just make sure you're very vocal with your MAC Artist about what you want and what you don't want. If you go in there and tell her to go crazy, don't be surprised when you leave with something a bit bolder than what you anticipated. It's good if you have color ideas, and a photo of your dress too.    You should definitely go in for a trial, but go to a counter. They will charge you for this, because they're still using the same amount of makeup (and time) that they'd use on your wedding day. I suggest going to a counter because it's kind of dumb to pay $100 bucks to get your makeup done twice and not have any makeup to show for it. At least if you go to the counter for your trial, you'll leave with $50 worth of makeup. Just make sure you ask for a face chart when your MA is all done, so if you like the way it comes out, you can bring it to your MA on the day of your wedding and she'll have a list of everything your Trial MA used, and you can tell her what you liked and what you didn't like.    If you're looking for more MAC makeover advice, check out this thread on Specktra.net. It's a good idea to read over the whole thing, as some posts are more informative than others.  http://www.specktra.net/forum/f165/what-...    Good luck, and congratulations!|`|qOKFuXfLaa	MAC stores and MAC counters have different policies.   Diff charges, and even the back to mac policy is different.     MAC stores usually charge $50 and if you want, you can buy makeup  others just do your makeup for free as long as you purchase products that total $50+     It's up to the store/counter manager- they are all different   I don't think they do trial's though ... I've never seen them do trials|`|bVRgrvDbaa	I did that for a wedding. It was $50 not including trial. but the $50 went towards purchased items! It was a MAC counter in Macy's as well!|`|LSKeLOIGaa	First things first MAC does an outstanding job with makeup its like they were born to do it. I got my makeup done twice there. The first time I didnt pay anything but I bought everything that she used so thats how that went. The second time I did pay $50 to get my face done for prom. I went to a MAC store not a counter.

Ask ahead of time.  And also, be open to their ideas, but also have your own before going there.

rdqXXbFVaa	you don't have to. but it is highly recommended because the high heat content can damage your hair. so if you don't want to get split ends and dead hair then i would use a heat repellent serum.    goodluck!(:|`|BqnNXIAmaa	You can go to your salon or even a drugstore like CVS and Walgreens.

Also if your hair feels dry even after this also use biosilk therapy or chi silk infusion and your hair will feel real healthy.

This will make your hair really smooth so you won't have to use the iron as much and the heat seal will protect the hair from the heat.

And she is wearing them when she is with you, so she is wearing them for you. Who cares about other people, it is you and her world when it is the two of you. have fun, play. People shouldn't be looking that hard anyway. They have no life. Probably you are judging harder than everyone else. Other people just look and have different thoughts.

Y3bZsP2Naa	Want to get rid of Pimples and etc....    Listen Carefully... and follow it k! take a resolution.    You need to Wash your face with Warm water after being out.. To remove the dirt and oil that collects...  If You dont then The oil and dirt provides best environment for pimples to arise again!  You can use a good chemical-free face-wash too...     Next: You need to Use A good product. Try Nivea Mens Whitening Oil control... Watever its mens but u can use it, dont bother... ok if you dont want to then... You can always find a similar womens creme which will control oil sebum. I know only of that product.    Next: DIET IS MOST IMPORTANT!    No Aereated drinks.  No chocolates  No Oily foods. (At least reduce on this one.. cuz its impossible.. And if you restrict ur body from any oil... then its bad.)    Just Follow this for one to two weeks... and see the effects k.. :D|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	Go to a dermatologist and they will give you the best stuff like acutane!|`|SBMxJdyraa	use lakme matt effect for your oily skin............and i don' noe 4 the rest..........|`|2qfhWSNHaa	hi there, u should use Johnson's baby powder and on pimples u can apply a little mint and neem paste every day for some time and please dint use soap use a lemon or neem face wash .a Himalayas product will help u lot .drink a lot of water also and be care full that u should not have constipation.|`|hc9feeF5aa	Accutane, which can be prescribed by a dermatologist is the only cure for acne but it is very expensive and needs around 6 months to work.... your best bet is to use a soap free face wash for oily skin like dove or johnson and johnson both of which are mild, only use this twice a day.... the rest of the time generously wash your face with plain water....   If your spots are around your cheeks and jawline,,,, it means you are not brushing well, so use a better toothbrush and scrub harder...  For fairer skin, don't go out in the sun for like 2 weeks minimum,., if u have to leave leave at night,,,, no sun no tan, right? so you'll be fairer...

3lSgjGzraa	I have that dress!  I actually did the same thing, strangely, i bought it then the next day i decided i didn't like it but i put i with loads of black accessories and it looks good now, i know where the dress all the time =]..... here are some ideas.....  http://www.newlook.co.uk/1577581/1577581...  http://www.newlook.co.uk/1468763/1468763...  http://xml.riverisland.com/flash/content...  http://www.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs...  http://www.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs...  http://www.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs...  http://www.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs...

But I like whats underneath|`|bVRgrvDbaa	you were thinking it's volcom!     It's not the cutest, but who knows, maybe YOU can pull it off! {If it's your "style"}|`|VrjF986Aaa	the print is really ugly, and that kind of dress is shapeless and really doesn't flatter anybodies figure|`|XCpuUalOaa	To be honest, I don't really like the sight of that dress all on it's own. I think it would look really good on you, though, if you wore it with a black belt.|`|y4dvOq4eaa	i don't like it. take it back! it has no shape to it. not very flattering on anyone|`|b7246aa9c54ecf3cf12beff32046d863aa	it doesn't show any curves|`|oRRIU2Peaa	I Dont like it:/   lol|`|mDt03eXIaa	Um no, sorry lol. maybe for a coverup at the beach?|`|hE7fK4W0aa	Its fine .. a great summer dress :)|`|GqTSa85daa	I think it looks nice, and yes a belt would enhance it's overall look.  It's casual, easy to care for, etc.|`|R4jDg5Ksaa	It is kind of cute. To fix the fact that there is no shape to it really you could put a wide brown (it looks like it has brown on it to me) belt on it, like a high belt.  It really depends on when you want to wear it too - its a cute casual dress.|`|WWanOxHVaa	Not a dress for this season.  I probably would wear it in the summer thought, its sweet.|`|h9Ee9tnaaa	Yes what were you thinking?|`|hEFFg1hHaa	my opinion   i wouldn't like it maybe you should return it?|`|GZZXNsTZaa	Personally, I'm not a fan of how the colors/patterns work together.  Also, I don't think it would be very flattering of anyone's figure.  If you plan on wearing it rather than taking it back, it might be cute at the beach to wear over a swimsuit or something like that!|`|qNbHazO6aa	I think it's a nice dress - I agree with the idea of putting a belt around it. Good for summer, beach, etc. If you don't like it and can't return it to the store, you could try selling it online if you haven't worn it or taken the tags off.|`|scHA4BX2aa	if u wear a bel around your waist and a jackets it will look flippin awsome.!!!|`|Vm9JQ6zSaa	Honestly, I completely agree with you. I dont think no amount accessories will make this dress look better. Itz just too busy.|`|RKqrv2bpaa	it looks casual and good 4 going around but not good 4 all places and it's 4 morning only not 4 a night party or something|`|aqaTqSHnaa	what WERE you thinking?  Sorry to break it to ya but that is the ugliest effing dress I've ever seen.  It is shapeless, baggy and the coulrs don't match. As for the design, Pah! As soon as I saw the name of the dress I though DOGGY DRESS ALERT.... return it hun and save yaself the embarassement|`|0SVgZfWiaa	I think that with the right accessories, it can look really cute. Or you could even wear it over your bathing suit to the beach!!|`|ba7a44b7d91af5fa55ba04e5e48f373faa	sorry but i don't like it much.the brown at the top with the buttons is kind of cute (just kind of)but.....nope,I wouldn't ware it.|`|tS1kUfolaa	To be honest I don't like it, but its up to you whether you like it or not.
vJ6GI7oIaa	I have those rollers, and I use the biggest ones of the pack - and get a great result.  First, wash your hair, then towel dry it about 70%. Apply firm-hold mousse. Let it dry to about 80%, then put in the rollers and apply firm-hold hair spray. Leave it for 2-3 hours, or however how long it takes for your hair to dry completely. I do it about once a week and it looks good! :)  Edit: I use 4 of the big ones, then 2 of the smallest ones on the side bangs of my hair. If your hair isn't layered, it needs to be first. They're self-grip rollers, so providing your hair is damp, they'll stay in by themselves. Just grab big sections of hair and roll them up as far as possible, press down, and they'll stay in. They're great.
a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Leave in conditioner, or cut up a slice of the aloe vera plant and put in hair, leave it on then rinse.  Or Olive oil-the hair spray or you can use the real thing by putting it in your hair and then rinsing.|`|17Fx86WVaa	carols daughter hair products|`|UzATwcHUaa	www.mineralindulgence.com  you can only get these products from this website.  they are all natural.  I love the shea and cocoa hair cream|`|AA11737190	I have ethnic (European) hair, though less of it than I used to have. I just use Tresemme.
GTjkWZPlaa	Try using a vinegar rinse.  Put about 1/4 cup vinegar mixed with 3/4 cup warm water, apply to hair and leave on for a coupe of minutes.  It works great to remove buildup from the hair due to hairsprays, gel's, etc., so it might work to remove this serum.  My sister is a hair dresser and she told me about using vinegar.|`|73f7770346188bdc062e3fbca376d724aa	Try a clarifying shampoo. You can get one in almost brand, I like Suave & Herbal Essences clarifying shampoos because they're cheap and work well.|`|sQrPXHeXaa	Ive found that when my hair looks greasy i put baby powder in it... that might help take the grease out.|`|hXJxHmafaa	Try washing it again but also a LITTLE bit of baby powder will soak up grease. but that it the best way to get it out wash it twice the next time u take a shower & dont put conditioner on the top part or your hair where the grease it|`|39JI3FuOaa	when my hair feels greasy i shampoo it up to four times. don't put conditioner in it because that just adds more moisture. blow dry.|`|QNCh4rUbaa	hey!  i think the best thing you can do is use a shampoo that is strong enough. Tea Tree oil is suppose to have active ingredients which soak in oil.   It is used regularly for pimples etc, try using a tea tree oil shampoo - Body Shop have one for sure.. otherwise good health shops have their 'own brand' ones usually.    If you don't have access to this then try using a dandruff shampoo, they are suppose to dry out hair too. something like head and shoulders would work.    ... all this and time!   Hope this helps!|`|iO4duwGNaa	wash it  towel dry it  blow dry it  der
TPBfzLqjaa	IMO! The Gap does. The quality of clothing is excellent. I still have jeans from many moons ago made by them still in great condition. I don't mind paying for quality. Old Navy jeans aren't as strong as Gap and BR. I've noticed that they tear easy in the middle. BR is great also it's just that they're a little more expensive than the other companies. They also make more of dressier clothes than the other companies. Hope that helps!|`|VrjF986Aaa	Banana Republic|`|WSziasfMaa	Banana Republic, then old navy.  The Gap just sucks.|`|mDt03eXIaa	Banana republic, but they're also much more expensive. old navy is the cheapest (in terms of quality as well) and Gap falls somewhere in between.|`|lEecgx2haa	banana republic|`|AA12182074	I personally like Old Navy.|`|02cc387d0492fb4b77ed0085078dfcdfaa	In order of price it goes....     Banana Republic  Gap  Old Navy     Banana Republic is usually thought of to be the better quality of the three.|`|jUHuer63aa	Because they are all owned by the same company and makers, the quality difference is hardly noticeable. I have bought clothes from all three of those stores and the BR jeans lasted only a few weeks longer than Old Navy and Gap.    From best to worst:    1. BR  2. Old Navy  3. Gap|`|ua5U23iCaa	theyre all the same company, but different divisions........idk if theres a difference.....................|`|QNCh4rUbaa	Hey!  Well Old Navy has the most 'varied' if not worse quality. This is because their stuff is mostly made in various countries, some offering not a very good standard.    Second comes Banana Republic - they usually get their stuff made from countries like spain and portugal - which have an above than average standard but occasionally less than trustworthy names pop up.    The best quality has to be Gap. This is because even in Non- Western countries their stuff is of a rather good quality.    So in my opinion.. your money will be safe with Gap!  Hope this helps!|`|4b02abdf3c937703e4bef5fdda9f0206aa	Banana Republic, then Gap, then Old Navy. But they also have different styles too. BR carries more clothes for professionals and young adults. Whereas Gap and Old Navy are more for the younger hip crowd. But they have clothes than anyone can purchase!

0YneW8ORaa	I have mine pierced.I didn't feel anything,and I hide mine under my hair every single day. It's easy just make your bangs sweep to the side the piercing is on and then bam no problems.|`|9qSF7zT3aa	The oil from your bangs can irritate a new piercing along with the hair itself. I'd just not get one til after graduation. It's not worth the trouble.|`|HLmd17r9aa	I think you should ask your piercer first because many offer to pierce with piercing retainers. If you are able to get a clear piece of jewelry then it shouldn't be too hard to hide. If you have to get pierced with surgical steel, I think your bangs could probably hide it until it heals and you could then change the jewelry to a clear piece for school.    Good luck!    (P.S - how do you hide your monroe?)|`|tSrkRkVOaa	I have been in the same situation as you.  Right now i have my nose, tongue, and 5 on my ears....a few months ago i had those plus 3 more on my ears, and i was looking for more.    When was the last time you got a piercing?.     For me it was a total addiction, something new and fun that i always wanted.    At some point you have to stop. I think by you getting anymore right now would be a bit much. Think about it. Enjoy the ones you have. The consider it later.     Last year i was 16, i just let some time go by, and now i have realized that i dont want anymore.    Just think about it    And i think it would be very hard to hide....and plus, i hate eyebrow ones anyways haha....they only suit some people. others they just look bad,    Good luck,.  My advice is No.|`|JW3pbtvRaa	Go for it    It will look really good (Y)|`|kekFN3RIaa	Yeah I think you could hide it.    But its not safe to have to many peircings.|`|m0kQMWYeaa	get a see through one if you can in my school wont allow any peircing accept from ears (even they have to be small studs) i wouldnt recomend it because your hair might irrotate it but if you do get a small clear one and yeah hide it under your bangs if they tell you to take it out just say no they cant force you or touch you|`|6K1D6Azmaa	It doesn't hurt too much, but you won't be able to hide it. ?|`|8HnLYjK4aa	just buy a staple gun and go for it.|`|mDt03eXIaa	I don't think it hurts any more than any of your other piercings, but you definitely won't be able to hide it.. you're atcually supposed to keep your hair off a new piercing cause it can infect it. better off waiting (also eyebrow piercings on girls looks trashyyyy)    And if you have to hide your piercings at school what do you do about your monroe?
UByvC54Xaa	Cant answer the question completely for you as it is a personal choice.    To use wax or not use wax? This would have to be the single largest topic debated in the dreadlock community. A lot of sites that make dread waxes or support these companies are going to tell you that you need wax. You do not need to use wax if you do not wish to. Dread wax will not help your dreads tighten despite what these sites tell you. All the wax will do is neaten the appearance of your dreads and work as a glue to hold the outside of the dread together.     There are many types of waxes available that state they are appropriate for using on dreadlocks. Do not be sucked in too quickly, before you even consider buying a wax, check the ingredients on the label. DO NOT use any wax that lists petroleum in the ingredients. All petroleum-based waxes will damage your dreadlocks. You hear the stories of people cutting their dreads only to find, mould, dirt, grease and a horrible wax buildup inside their dreads  this is because of petroleum-based wax.    Have you tried to tie knots in a rope smothered in Vaseline and a smooth slimy texture? It doesnt knot as easily as a plain rope (no Vaseline) and a rough texture. This is what using wax is like. It will actually take longer and be a lot more difficult for your dreads to tighten when covered in wax. I also think that the wax would make it harder for your hair to knot by blocking all those little loose gaps in your dreads plus not allowing your hair to breathe properly. With this being said, I believe it is still ok to use a non-petroleum-based wax in small doses when needed. Like, say if you had a special event or a date or something and you want to look neat, then just apply a little bit of wax. I will probably wax my dreads with an m&m sized amount once a fortnight, just to help round my dreads. They do tend to flatten while you are sleeping. Im being honest here. It is quite funny the amount of people who tell you that wax is evil but are still using it themselves!    If you do decide to use a dread wax, I suggest you stick with the more mainframe brands such as knottyboy or dreadheadhq. Do not use too much wax or you will smother your dreadlocks and they will not be able to breathe. Dreadlocks are not deadlocks. Your hair is still alive, it is just being forced to grow as a vine would, entangling your hair as it grows.    With all of this being said, there will still be people out there ready to debate my thoughts on dreads and wax. So my advice to you; If you want to use wax  use it. If you do decide to use wax, make sure you apply it to fully dried hair. If you apply it to wet/damp hair you will trap moisture inside the dread resulting in mildew, mould and dog-smelling dreadlocks.    Just a little food for thought.    For more advice check out my yahoo group http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/dre...    or    dreadlockforums.com|`|29mkgbkqaa	I would never advise anyone to use any form of wax on dreads, because it just acts a filler, and not a means of locking hair. What I mean by filler is, wax just fills in the space between your hair, keeping it from locking properly. Also, wax coats your hair, and repels water, so when you are washing your hair, your actually just washing the wax, this can eventually lead to mold growth in your hair, which is super nasty. Basically the only use for wax is to make your dreads, look like dreads, before they actually lock.|`|AjdaezeTaa	there is no need to wax them  loose hairs happen|`|4AnOHrAPaa	Well from what I understand, if you are just starting your locs out, you should not be washing it until at least about 3 months after they have been started. This is to avoid the unravelling that you are experiencing. Wax is only going to build up in your hair, as it is not water soluble, and will not rinse out. I suggest going to a professional loctition in your area who can help you care for your locs. It also may depend on the hair type you have. You didn't say if your hair is kinky or straight, or anything else. Kinky hair types tend to loc faster and easier. Straighter types take a little longer, but it can still be done. Try that. Or if you don't want to seek the help of a professional, try entering dreadlocks or locs as they are really known now, into your browser and choose the best listing for loc grooming and care. Hope that helps.|`|aqaTqSHnaa	GET RID OF THOSE DREADLOCKS...|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Use wax sparingly.  Too much will cause your hair to smell.  Eventually your hair will "lock" and you won't need to do anything but maintain the new growth into the twisted pattern of the loc.  I had locs  for several years.|`|Dm3AHmG5aa	As stated you need to give your hair time to start locking, you are probably washing it to often and not giving it enough time to lock up. Bee's Wax works very well that's what I use on my boyfriends locks and I re twist the new growth every other weekend, but if yours are just staring out you may need to do that every few days or at least once a week. and STOP washing it so much. Hopes this helps
XN0cYCATaa	Try Using Alberto VO 5 Hairdressing, Watch These Videos.    http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...  http://www.expotv.com/videos/reviews/3/4...|`|3F8bCZ55aa	Yes because dying it is a chemical process which is what damages hair.|`|BqnNXIAmaa	If you shampoo your hair every day on top of dying it then yes that dries out your hair.  Try using Biosilk therapy or chi silk infusion if will make your hair silky and less dry.  Straightening all the time isn't the best for your hair either.  Try straightening and washing your hair every other day.|`|ijXOMlIsaa	hell yeah!    If you frequently dye your hair you MUST use treatments in between to restore moisture and shine to your hair!!!!|`|hXJxHmafaa	yes it is drying it out & straitening it makes it worse b/c your putting extra heat on it. you probaly blow dry it 2 wich make it even worse. you need color care shampoo & conditioner, after you wash your hair put a leave in heat protector/smoother on it (like biosilk, its silicone based & heat protectant) & you also need a treatment like once a month like keraphix by Nexxus. & try letting your hair air dry all the way & then straiten it. & try not to wash your hair every day. & a CHI iron works the best even though they are kinda expensive|`|39JI3FuOaa	Straightening makes your hair more dry. When you shower, try conditioning twice and/or shampooing your hair every other day. You can also buy a leave in conditioner creme to put on your hair when you get out of the shower. There is also heat protector that you can buy to protect it from the straightener. I would try to cut down the number of times you dye your hair because dying it will cause it fall out when you get older. If your scalp has moisture, that will help your hair keep moisture. A dry scalp will suck the moisture out of your hair.|`|Cznxdxzeaa	Dying your hair will make your hair dry,weak, and damaged. You have to have your hair deep conditioned and use a hot oil treatment twice a month. Also at night, you should apply a leave in moisterizer.    Try using a rinse instead of permanent color.|`|f4c4b198b4aa27d1f0dc5ce86dcd3c89aa	Yes but only if you don't take extra steps with your hair.  If you want to dye it frequently you have to be prepared to get deep conditioning treatments, as few heat products as possible, invest in hair protection products etc.    :D  x|`|Oh8Qh0Efaa	I my self try to dye my hair every 2-3 months and it does make it dry even if you do straighten it. But, Herbal Essences has conditioners and shampoos for color treated/dry hair. I use Hello Hydration.|`|V51YyLKaaa	the average time to dye your hair is about every 3-4 months.   it mostly depends on the condition of your hair.    try panteen pro-v restortives there realy good for your hair it restores years of highlights diying your hair blow driying and flat ironing  good luck
HnT1ZK0Baa	I love the twist up ones. If I make sure I use them at an angle, it wears to a nice point.  I find that the sharpener ones hurt my eyes too, I think pieces of wood, when shaved, get into the stick part.  They break, they waste a lot, and you have to always have a sharpener!  I find the twist ones to be really convenient and it's easy to make sure they don't break.  They cost a bit more though, so if it's the amount of actual eyeliner you're worried about, you're probably using the same amount for your buck.  Advice though!  Don't twist it up too high!  I found out the hard way that some don't twist back down :(|`|GtfU3BHiaa	I have used both types, and I have found the soft kohl eyeliners to work the best for me. It goes on smooth and it doesnt hurt. You can get soft kohl in either pencil or twist-up form. Avon has a great twist-up eyeliner, called Glimmersticks Waterproof Eye Liner. It runs about 6 dollars. If you could also find a "no-tug" eye liner, those help prevent wrinkles by not pulling your eyelid as you're lining it.|`|V6qhmHOSaa	i use the maybelline twist up... I think it's called define a line or something? anyway it's green with a brown top.. I really like it.  No sharpening makes it much better than a pencil and it doesn't hurt like a pencil can. I used a pencil for years but switched over and haven't gone back! hope this helps!|`|JikYKTWbaa	I personally don't like the pen like ones.  They usually have less of a color, like the black turns out faded or grey.  And I don't mean the cheap ones, I use the good ones.  I love love love the pencils, but if they hurt you, maybe they're too dull. Try sharpening them so the wood part doesn't come as close to your eye.|`|ND4wPcQkaa	I like the twist up kind. It tends to look better on me and it goes on super easy. My eyeliner lasts all day and i just use covergirl. The color doesn't fade or anything. If i were to use pencils again, i'd go for a higher end brand probably because all of the drugstore kinds have been crappy for me.|`|NrScBuhlaa	I really like the twist-up ones. I use CoverGirl's.

Your pretty! :)|`|HnTpvVEEaa	i like your eyes. they are very unique, you should be proud of them. i mean i have blue eyes and everyone always complaments them. but i still think they look boring and dull at times. but i would never get colored contacts because that is ME. i think no one is completly happy with theirself. and you may not like that color but i and probably alot of others think it looks great=]|`|GHjPLWq7aa	first one nice|`|cjg91wfjaa	Your eyes look beautiful if you ask me, but if you MUST alter them, yeah I also say go with blue.
RZQTV1UEaa	make sure you're not chewing gum, for starters  don't open your mouth too wide  only use the tip of your tongue  swallow right before, so you don't have too much saliva in your mouth    good luck.......I'm sure you'll do fine.|`|m0kQMWYeaa	same problem its so awkward i dont know when to kiss my bf like properly :( good luck|`|mDt03eXIaa	Not to alarm you, but most guys open their mouths waaay too wide and try to swallow your face. Especially if he hasn't kissed alot of girls, expect alot of slobber lol. For your part, relax, don't open your mouth too wide, and don't completely shove your tongue in there. A little bit of tongue is always better than licking the back of his throat.  In spite of what you may think, it actually does come pretty naturally, and most first kisses are really bad and akward, if anything it will be a funny story for you to look back on and laugh. lol.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	hehehe, at least you know who you kissed. The first guy I kissed, I didn't know his name, plus I had no idea what I was doing. Just go w/ the flow and find a good rythm. Do what feels natural.|`|utYGZA0Naa	Find the right moment kind of jesture him to tell him how you want it but also make it special like princess diaries even in a shack or under the stars you cant go wrong never use to much tougue or saliva thats gross and tilt your head kiss his neck be playful and have fun live in the moments!

gXlwQsDeaa	I agree with you 100%. Us women have to do so much crap to make ourselves look good and "sexy" enough for guys to like us. But men don't have to do freakin thing. they have it so easy, but girls are always the ones to be bashed on. And, duh, we're totally the more dominant sex. Seriously, gosh, we have the babies!  ?|`|h6AH6Biyaa	Guys look for physical beauty -- they're visual types.    Girls can tell pretty quickly when a guy's good looks are only skin deep, and hide a repellent personality.  When young girls are stuck in that stage where they swoon over some guy's looks, it seems awfully silly to the slightly more mature girls.     However, since we live in the world we do, we girls might as well pay attention to style and grooming without getting too obsessive about it.  Sooner or later the right guy will appear, and he will first notice how you look.  Take care of that, so he can get the chance to appreciate your personality and intelligence.     Also, remember that there are lots of other people in the world besides single guys.  Adults of all ages, children, even people you don't know, are looking at you -- might as well put your best foot forward!|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Men provide $, offer personality and sense of humor.    Women must attract that man. Once she has him her job is over. Dudes don't really care about a personality. Be pretty and don't be crazy and you are set.    The fems are gonna hate my answer but it is the answer.  That is why you see foxy women with ugly old rich guys.|`|uPRYwa3zaa	some men take care of themselves like i straighten my hair and shave below the belt and other things that could be considered metro or what not but i just consider it having pride in my appearance. you honestly sound like a lesbian or a man hater, but that's just me. sometimes i think it can be the other way around and women can be just as judgmental as men, i mean i bet a lot of fat ugly chicks expects hot guys. and I've seen more fit guys going out with larger women than the other way around|`|r6o6NF3Eaa	Well there is always the option of a pair of breast and a strp on....|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	I like Sunnyman's answer but would like to add that it's not so much the guys putting pressure on women to look a certain way.  It's the media and other women.  I have asked so many women about this and they all agree that they compete against other women to look better and stay on the top of their game.  Guys don't care what brand you are wearing - they don't care what combination of clothes, or if you have Uggs boots, Abercrombie or how many handbags you have but women seem to compete with other women for these things.  Another thing is that the media glamourises the stick thin image and other images yet the women support them by buying the magazines.  They should vote with their money by not supporting such magazines.    It also seems that no matter how many times guys say they prefer natural boobs, even if they are flat boobs, an increasing number of women still seem hellbent on cosmetic surgery and breast implants.  So I do believe they are competing with other women.    Men can't really win though because if they DO take care of their appearance then some people will say they are "gay" or "metrosexual" and make fun, and if they don't take care of themselves then people will say they are ugly or plain.  Personally I work out a lot and am very sporty, so I have a muscled body.  I don't have short plain hair - mine is just like Chace Crawford's.  It is medium, naturally straight with the same style.|`|gvnNy7Rtaa	Good luck dating women then or becoming a spinster. :)  I could never be that mean about women and think women are wonderful.  Sorry you hate men.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	I AGREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WITH YOU 100%    feminist rock|`|KWl605JTaa	no i think it's the other way around accually. from the exeption of slobs, a pretty girl probably wouldn't give a fat guy a chance, no matter how clean and professional. and guys do a lot of grooming, such as shaving their face, fixing their brows, trying to keep their hands smooth, trying to keep a clean hair cut(which they have to do a lot because most guys don't like to grow out their hair). a lot of girls are very judgemental towards guys. but I do agree, guys can be extremley judgemental too.|`|mvAgLB9laa	An answer from a guy - yes it is a double standard when it comes to looks. Women are supposed to be thin, and sexy all the time ( or so that's what the world has made us to think) and yet a man with a large frame is just okay...Double standards - and it has nothing to do with feminism and crap.|`|ro3X9fs3aa	i agree but thers nothing , we as woman can do about this , but we can stand for each other , btw jb lol i think ther ugly 2 , if they werent famous they would be some ugly lossers , fame gives u alot sometimes .|`|qPdasc4naa	Omg, my thoughts exactly,guys are sooo overated.|`|LAbQy9d4aa	LOL, a feminist.

AA11385255	No. I have curly dark brown hair I have used it over and over and it's awesome. I use the Red on it but you'll need to do it three separate times to get a really deep red colour. (I also use a high heat wet-to-dry straightener, and it doesn't effect the colour or anything.) I can show you pictures if you'd like- email me at somuchlaughter05@yahoo.com.

GZKbvXLLaa	In my opinion, avoid pawn shops at all costs. Unless they are your absolute last resort, avoid them. Unfortunately, when it comes to jewelry of any type, you are only going to receive a fraction of the price you paid for the item no matter where you sell it. But pawn shops are known to pay the least of all, no mater what type of item it is. They are not there to help you. They are in business to make profit for themselves and no one else.|`|FxAD44Moaa	you would have done better in ebay!    they gave you less than scrap value!   scrap value is $40  per gold item.   assuming the rings were a form of gold element.|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Usually pawn shops give you only a fraction of what they are worth when you pawn something.   Give you an example. I had a shotgun stolen several years back. Reported and gave police the serial number.  A little over a year ago the police found it in a pawn shop when going through the serial numbers of the guns on sale or something.  Anyway the pawn shop paid $75.00 for it and was selling it for $600.00. Well $899.99. New the gun cost me around $1200.  The pawn shop dealer actually had the gall to want me to reimburse him the $75.00.  Good thing the detective went with me to retrieve it.|`|FoPkWViOaa	in my experience, pawn shops are lousy places to sell things, and even worse places to borrow money.  that being said, it would depend on the rings..  what kind/quality of emerald?  white gold?  yellow gold?  walmart gold?

d5003b1b3346095d29688d8bfb95c640aa	Im a mom and a hairstylist, I keep mine about right below bra strap. I keep long layers in the back and shorter layers around the face, a small section right in the front bang area chin length. I wear it many different ways, I have a body wave so some days I wash and scrunch it, other days I roll all over with a big 2 inch barrell curling iron for fullness, no curl, then sometimes I take it like Im going to make a pony tail then twist it and secure it with a big clip pulling some strands down around my face and leaving the top loose around the crown. I do wear a pony tail sometimes and because bangs are long, I can slick them back with the rest or leave a few strands hanging. a dressier way for a pony tail is after you secure it with a band, take your finger above the band, split hair in half, bring bottom of hair up and thru the space you just made and pull thru, it gives a little roll there and hides the rubber band.  as far as coloring, on clients with medium brown hair, I either foil a few pieces or pull it thru a cap and leave bleach on (under dryer) for 10 minutes, it brings out the natural highlights and adds shine|`|83f5c3548466389efa9b697a8720e236aa	Sometimes its good to look at high fashion advertisements, I'm a guy, but that's where I get all my haircuts from. I look through Men's Vogue, GQ, on the company sites, etc. for brands like Versace, Prada, Dior, etc. and get ideas for haircuts, these companies are famous for making elegant, beautiful, "WOW" type clothing, and in their ads, they have to show that with good looking models wearing their great clothes along with great hair to go with it. I posted a few ads with haircuts I thought looked cute, elegant, sexy, etc. but clean enough for a mom to use. If you like one just print it out and your hairstylist can cut it or dye it like that or maybe not even have to change your hair, just tell you how to style it. Sometimes it's about knowing how to style it. Oh, and if you want to check out more hairstyles, I got all the ads below from: http://bwgreyscale.com/ad_index.html    Hope this helps, ciao!|`|fc2875d2bbdde73902a354b8e54f2ad1aa	you should get it blonde with your hair cut short with lots of layers and honey brown highlights. i kno a lady who has the same and she get tons of compliment everyday.|`|a3ab364ba80159a8c09beb1aa27b9987aa	cut it and mix with sparm then eat   ha ha ha     mail me for details :-    fahad_care@yahoo.com|`|c85977058947f8edf9c4498ddb8890c6aa	Curl it in ringlets... thats always nice.

Speak to your hairdresser about some blonde highlights to bring it out a bit.  I have long dark straight hair with colours through it and I only do it once a week, because it stays straight, I can wear it down for the first 3 days and then up in different styles until I wash it again.

AA12319961	I usually just wear a regular shirt. A black long-sleeve shirt looks really good with Camo Pants. As far as the length goes, you'll have to shop around. I have the same problem because of a long torso. But the only shirts I've found to be long enough are Old Navy's Tiny Tees. I have a small waist and back as well so these shirts work really great. They have a long waist, but if you have a small frame, these are the shirts for you. Plus they do stretch over your boobs, without over stretching the shirt, if you have a figure like mine. They're the only shirts I've found so far that fit me perfectly.    http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do... You can tell just by the picture the length is longer.

I personally think the lesser the better, I use one drop of foundation and a tiny bit of lotion and it works well. (basically one part foundation, two parts lotion) You should never ever use your fingers when applying foundation you have a lot of oils on your fingers and on your face the two put together make you break out. Oh and one more thing replace the make-up sponge every week (they sell them in bulk so it shouldn't be expensive) to prevent bacterial growth.|`|e4603764d0b240516f0afe38d6511bd6aa	get powder foundation, and use a brush to even it out all over your face.. it works because I used to have the same problem!|`|AA11014669	the reason why it looks soo good in the bathroom is becuase the lighting is'nt that great, you go outside and its bright if it looks uneven and not natural it means its the WRONG shade. i would considder going to a make up counter or taking a friend with you to a drug store to help choose a foundation and go outside with a mirror and see if it looks natural. using a brush will also make your foundation look more natural then get a sponge or big kabuki and buff the foundation in|`|c5ec0014eaccadd1063404da7009e9a4aa	use your fingers when applying foundation.  i use the whipped foundation.  the heat from your fingers warms up the cream, and it goes on nice and even.|`|AA12005439	Use bare minerals.

If you feel you don't have enough on, you can always put on more. Put on correctly, foundation should give you a natural look.   Also, have you ever gone to the makeup consultants at your favorite department store? Maybe another problem is that you are not using the correct shade of foundation.|`|40002d49198ef727fa9085f0dac916beaa	bare minerals or but it on with a fluffy blush brush. if you just brush it on and then brish it somemore then it will blend right with your skintone (oh and make sure you have the color)

No, I dont think the world wants to see my thong. I certainly dont like seeing mens boxers hanging out of their pants. I guess either designers need to make the "low rise" pants not so low or Victoria Secret needs to come up with some seriously low rise thongs.|`|5274aa4ea4e3b7a20b15bb670e757117aa	i mean i just think girls do that to get attention from guys......|`|AA11755494	yeah of course|`|AA10626996	yes I do ... tacky, tacky, tacky.......|`|aa98ad0f9cb6b9158441507e5d5cdab6aa	YES.  Can you say Brittney Spears?    Oh and to Precious J - You need to go to school and learn how to spell.  What YOU don't get, is that guys are going to look at you and only like you because you show off all your assets.  You have no idea how great it is for a guy to like you because he thinks your pretty and because he likes your personality and intellect until it happens.  And when you get a nice guy like that, he's not going to like you showing everything off because he'll want you all for himself.|`|44c61ebbdf1b1abb39472ef3706acb43aa	No...I saw a kid Sunday..with his whole a*ss exposed..his  pants were totally underneath his butt cheeks...that is a little much...it's such a stupid look....right next to the tacky tail..that males sported in the early 90's....you know..get a hair cut and   leave that stupid annoying long piece.....blatt!!!!|`|3bbaa47e0cfe3ac70149b3ea53041db2aa	I don't know about the ladies, but here's one guy who votes YES!!!!
4bf0fa1c3be1c0172a039c0df22c2310aa	well are you fair skinned or olive=toned. that makes a big difference. im guessing youre a natural redhead(unlike me =O)  so stick with light application. use colors like green and blue and purple and even a bronze would look really pretty. my friend has really fair skin, green eyes, and red hair. she doesn't over do it but she looks gorgeous. it's all about shading and where you apply the color and blending.     if you really dont know how to don any of that. go to a place like MAC or Clinique (in the mall) and just tell them your situation and that you really wanna knw what to do and most likely they'll give you a free makeover and they'll show you how to do it and what colors they use. I highly recommend MAC. i LOVE MAC . its where i learned to really do my makeup and everything. Plus, its great quality!!!|`|AA10238716	try  justforredheads.com  It's a whole line of makeup, duh, just for redheads. My sister is a redhead with freckles.

Gold has never let me down and is great for any occasion!|`|d0c3f7b31aa7d8f568478a0bad6c9137aa	go to a makeup counter and get a make over. they will tell you what looks good, and be honest with them, if you dont like it, so you can try another look. MAC makeup artists, are the best|`|AA11484160	well all you have to do go to a professial thanks byye!!!!!!!!!
GZKbvXLLaa	As the old saying goes, if it seems to good to be true...    Well, I would honestly recommend against using this site. I have never ordered from them, but here is what I can tell you just by a little research.     They opened in September of 2008. That isn't very long for an online site to be in business. Their site is registered through www.godaddy.com. This is a web hosting site where many - though not all, fly by night sites can come and go for just a few bucks a month. That was red flag  1. But the biggest red flag went up when I saw their payment policy. They accept pay pal, which is relatively safe, but look at the rest of the payments accepted:  http://www.trade-garden.com/page.html?id...  Western Union, Bank transfer, and Money Gram are never, ever a safe way to do business with an online site. Especially one located in China that is only in business for less than five months. Also, have a look at this:  http://www.trade-garden.com/page.html?ch...  Read carefully through all of it. There are a lot of red flags here. All the merchandise are factory knock-offs. They openly admit to it. Read  3 on that page, and you'll see what I mean.   I could go on, but you get the point. I wish I could tell you they are reputable. But, I can't. I don't know for sure, but every indication I saw leads me to believe that this is a scam site. If you choose to do business with them, please be careful!  I hope this helps...

If so there is a product called sun in, if you are already somewhat blonde it will work great and has soothing botanicals and leave in conditioner.  It just needs a lot of sun to work, because you just spray it on the spot you lighten up.  I live in michigan so its not always sunny hear and i used it for that same purpose all sommer and it bleached my hair naturally and my hair stayed super smooth even thogh the rest is all crackly and gross. garnier nuctrise has teh best dye for your hair if you just end up dying it.|`|60YCR6ytaa	i'd be careful with bleaching your hair my friend bleached hers too much and her hair fell out =/|`|0f18eHcXaa	use head and shoulders shampoo, it'll help your roots becoem thick and no longer sore (:|`|SBb7xgb6aa	ya i wouldn't suggest bleaching to anyone who likes their hair...  i bleached my tips once, and they felt like straw; and I conditioned them every day!

3a265dcf1f1564c6dc881bed572711e2aa	find a salon that does NOT have the spray on tan by machine. I work at a tanning salon and we get people that come in to us on a daily basis to fix there spray on tan. The machines can't tell if you are getting blotchy or orange. They can't make sure it is even or too thin.     The only spray tan solution we have found to work the absolute best is by 'California Tan'. So if you call around ask what brand they use.     At the salon I work at, our spray on tan is $39. Just a one time spray last 2 weeks. No one looks orange or funky. You look like you have a sun kissed bronzed tan. Even if you are pale as a marshmallow. It gradually fades away, and you look the same as before. Not spots or funky tan lines.     It is worth the money if it is done right. It is not something you want to do a whole lot. If you are looking for a year round tan, try the tanning beds.|`|29c15bb2861816934f02e1f2b2830b93aa	I've been there a couple times.     -It lasts about...meh, 4-5 months? yeah.   -once should be enough to get tan, but maybe 2-3 for pale ppl.(i'm med.tan, so i really am not sure about that.)  -nope. you just look...whiter.   -i think so. especially for those gross tan lines.|`|e36f9f806f293a4254edc5cc9a3661d2aa	I have not used this machine gadgety thing, but I do have a friend who has. If you think that orange is "in" and "sexy" I say go for it. Personally, I would't want someone asking me, "can I peel you?" They do turn out blotchy, especially if water touches your body. It tends to look like a river of orangeness is running down your arm, or leg, or wherever the water touched. In other words, no, it is not worth the money. And if you are "super pale," I really don't think many things will help to make you tanner. Embrace your paleness. You would have been quite cherished in the renaissance era, my dear.    p.s- don't tell my friend. =]|`|ed36a5df9ac63339cd6873198499b5f1aa	I buy my tanning solution from a supplier by the Litre. First exfoliate body. Then put sorbaline cream around dry spots like ankles, knees, elbows and neck.  Using a "sea sponge" (this is the secret) dip it in solution and wipe over areas of body.  Once finished rinse sponge then wipe over those parts again that had sorbaline on just so they wont be too dark.  Put on some light clothing after 6-8hours you can shower it off.  This should last about a week.  Get someone to apply it for you. A bottle usually costs $85 australian so 2 applications will have paid for itself. I use Bonza Bronz. Great colour.(Machiato).|`|8f5ab9b2f3905ece8746334d0199fa28aa	the spray tans look really fake and there's 3 levels. 1 being the lowest and 3 being the darkest. if you do a level 3 you should already  be a little dark and that tan will last about 4-6 days.if youre pale and you use a level 3 you'll end up looking really orange. no it's not worth the money because the absolute most it will last is a week and depending on where you go you could look orange which is the case most of the times.  on average its about $45 for one session. i prefer real tanning beds although theyre bad for you. its cheaper and lasts longer and looks a lot better.|`|4cda4c1c7c21664d9e957eab13142541aa	If you go for a spray tan, don't use a booth! Get it applied professionally, in my area I use http://www.tropical-sunrise.com With someone doing it you WON'T go orange and you WON'T be streaky!      The main thing is to not overdo to.  Go for a light to medium tan if you are pale - it will look much more natural than a full on caribbean tan!  You can always try darker next time.    It is more likely to look blotchy when fading if you have gone for a real dark tan. You should be the correct colour after ONE visit. But it is true that if you do it regularly, the colour becomes richer.    Is it worth the money? To me it is, and not only is it safer than UV beds, it works out cheaper as well.|`|f223cc79210516854f8ea61684592736aa	It's not worth it, you would be better off just using a self tanner at home or going to a tanning bed, because the spray on tans at a tanning salon... it makes you look so orange, not tan but orange.
d9d5e15ca4cfa3567a3ea2afc3a749e5aa	Nenhuma das duas!!  Pra mim  a Gama Ceramic Laser Ion  Voc n?o imagina o BRILHO que o cabelo fica simplesmente com o ato de passar a chapinha nos cabelos! Eu fikei de boca aberta!   O  cabelo fika superliso, lindo, ilumado. Se ficar espetado, no dia seguinte os fios abaixam.  DICAS IMPORTANTES:  - Nunca fa?a chapinha sem antes usar um bom termo-protetor. Uso um timo da AlfaParf - NutriSeduction,  muuuuito bom.  - Vc sabia que a escova + a chapinha acaba com 70% da hidrata??o? Quando voc alisa seus cabelos regularmente,  necessrio hidratar o cabelo com mais frequencia, tipo 1 vez por semana, com produtos que vc considere bons mesmo. E uma vez por mes no mximo fa?a reconstru??o, ou no sal?o, ou em casa, mas com uma linha profissional.     A chapinha  muito boa meeesmo! Mas ela  fonte de calor, e como toda e qualquer fonte de calor pode danificar os cabelos se for feita mais que 1 vez a cada 10 dias!    Seu cabelo pode ficar lindo por um tempo, liso sempre  muito bonito.Mas se vc n?o tratar, com o tempo ele vai perder o vi?o, a elasticidade, ficar ressecado, e dificilmente se dar bem com o que voc usava antes para hidrat-lo.  A no caso, s com produtos profissionais pra recuperar tudo isso.  Boa sorte!|`|16a778904c017ae48a09351effa8b180aa	N?o conhe?o nenhuma das duas.

nJzL045qaa	I'm ironically dealing with the same issue!-Weird.  My hair was cut up to my chin.  I'm working on a few things.  Here is what I found worked for me in the past when I desperately needed to get my hair back:    -Scalp massages!  Do these about 3 to 4 x a day.  I notice a difference within the first few weeks by doing these.  The reason why most hair doesn't grow is b/c of lack of stimulation like brushing and finger massaging.  These massages help to stimulate root growth and relax you.    -Multivitamins!  If you aren't already taking one, do so.  People need healthy vitamins anyways, but these will give you all the nutrients you are lacking.  Whatever your body doesn't need, it will get rid of it.    -Common sense!  You have to realize that hair can't magically grow like Rapunzel's over a few weeks.  TRY not to stress, b/c that can stunt healthy growth.  Just look at your nails.  If they could use some help, that's a good indication your hair could too.  Eat iron and red meat as well as beans b/c they bring oxygen to the hair and aid growth, and drink lots of water.  Hot weather is coming and I heard in a beauty book written by the editors of Allure that warmer weather helps hair growth in some way.    ~Good luck.  We're in the same boat :)|`|BXfHhsXqaa	I think that you should shampoo and condition frequently, but not like a crazy person. btw, you should choose Sassy for the best answer.|`|hO4OPB51aa	Try lush new shampoo bar.|`|asGVrqhEaa	Cut the ends every 2 weeks.|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	Take vitamins and use a really good shampoo & conditioner.|`|OH8BqPv4aa	Unfortunately its mostly genetics but a well balanced nutrient rich diet can help as well as a multi vitamin or prenatal vitamin.most of all realize hair is dead & must be treated like delicate silk- brush carefully do not overwash & limit heat exposure-invest in good products-best of luck!

Horse shampoo sounds crazy but it ACTUALLY works.  I used it on my hair for a month and it grew 4 inches. It might not work for everyone but it worked for me.

6e0167225be7b0777c7002a89cefdd09aa	Do you mean   a    " SUN DIAL"   ?      A sundial measures time by the position of the sun. The most commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.    Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variations can measure standard and daylight saving time, as well.    Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BCE) are known from ancient Egypt, and were developed further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek[1], and Roman cultures. A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament (Isaiah 38:8).   The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BCE-ca. 100 BCE) is said to have invented a universal sundial that could be used anywhere on Earth. The French astronomer Oronce Fin constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying illustrations.    Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. By tilting such a sundial, it may be installed so that it will keep time. However, some mass-produced garden sundials are inaccurate because of poor design and cannot be corrected. A sundial designed for one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base so that its style or gnomon is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation, so that it points at the north celestial pole in the northern hemisphere, or the south celestial pole in the southern hemisphere.       Horizontal sundial in Taganrog (1833).A local standard time zone is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow geographic and political boundaries. A sundial can be rotated around its style or gnomon (which must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a rotation in the range of 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees west suffices.    To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table. An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for winter. Rotating the sundial will not work well because most sundials do not have equal hour angles.    Ordinary sundials do not correct apparent solar time to clock time. There is a 15 minute variation through the year, known as the equation of time, because the Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical and its axis is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit. A quality sundial will include a permanently-mounted table or graph giving this correction for at least each month of the year. Some more-complex sundials have curved hour-lines, curved gnomons or other arrangements to directly display the clock time.|`|17e417a32b7d414eeb2825baa4cc11b7aa	A sundial measures time by the position of the sun.

A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament (Isaiah 38:8). [1]    The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BC-ca. 100 BC) is said to have invented a universal sundial that could be used anywhere on Earth.

However, some mass-produced garden sundials are inaccurate because of poor design and cannot be corrected. A sundial designed for one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base so that its style or gnomon is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation, so that it points at the north celestial pole in the northern hemisphere, or the south celestial pole in the southern hemisphere.

Some more-complex sundials have curved hour-lines, curved gnomons or other arrangements to directly display the clock time.      Design & principles of operation    Terminology  The 'shadow-maker' of the sundial is called a gnomon.    The sun casts a shadow from the gnomon to a surface called the dial face or dial plate (often shortened to face).    Most sundials indicate time on the dial face by the shadow of a line in space called the style[2]. On a standard garden sundial, this line is the top edge of the gnomon. The style should be parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation. In common speech, sometimes style refers to the entire gnomon.    Some sundials indicate both the time and the date by the shadow of a particular point on the gnomon. That point is called the nodus. The nodus may be the tip of a gnomon with an arbitrary (usually horizontal or vertical) orientation[3].    A few sundials have both a style and a nodus, with the nodus in the form of a small sphere or a notch on a polar-pointing gnomon, or simply the tip of the gnomon.    In general, the best material for a face is a very light color to give a high contrast with the shadow. The numerals should be dark, visible on the unshaded portion of the face. The gnomon should be sturdy, preferably metal, because gnomons are usually thin, and can break easily. The traditional luxury materials are a white marble face, with markings inlaid in black marble. Traditional styles are thick bronze to prevent corrosion.    It is traditional for a sundial to have a motto.      Equatorial or Equinoctial sundial  The simplest sundial is a disk mounted on a bar. The bar must be parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation. The disk forms a plane parallel to the plane of the Earth's equator. The disk is marked so that one edge of the shadow of the bar shows the time as the Earth rotates. Usually noon will be at the bottom of the disk, 6AM on the western edge, and 6PM on the eastern edge. In the winter, the north side of the disk will be shaded, and hard to read. In the summer, the south side will be shaded.    In the above design, the bar is the style. The disk in the above design is called the face. In the summer, the north end of the bar is the nodus, but in the winter, the south end of the bar is the nodus.       A sundial in the Forbidden City, Beijing.A series of concentric circles can be drawn on the face which plot the path of the shadow of the nodus on specific days, thus the dial can be used as a calendar as well as clock. The style shows the time and the nodus the date. One disadvantage of this design is that with a solid face, near the equinox, when sun is just on the celestial equator, the dial is hard to read.

As a general rule, over the counter hair removal creams are not made for the ***entire*** bikini area. You have sensitive tissue there and its best not to risk it. If you are sexualy active, you can increase your risk of an STD if you have open areas of irritation. If you want to go totally bare your best bet is to see an esthetician and have it waxed off. You can try to wax it off at home yourself if you are brave. There are numbing creams you can get, and be sure to use a hard wax (stripless wax). GiGi is a good at home product.|`|8f3453ff5dad2986b6d86b0423723ff8aa	I do. im very sensitive, so theres always a bit of after burn! but not too bad. use it all the time and it works great!|`|e45af13f9458d6f0abbafe4e8e7930e3aa	i would not recommend veet or any other hair removal cream for the bikini area.u should probably go for shaving or waxing rather ..|`|c2b02e9ecd23f132f51e1510e98b8b8faa	its ok, u may get mild irritation|`|6c24bd09d5554084f9dcc2b1547b01d3aa	I DO NOT reccomend that you do.

I have been a longtime user of Bare Minerals and I personally would not use anything else. I love it. You get great coverage that is adjustable to your needs and it is great for sensitive skin. It feels and looks like you are wearing next to nothing and it is really good for your skin. I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin since I started wearing it. The trick is to apply only what you need. A little goes along way. Plus I think that overall you get more for your money with Bare Minerals. I haven't used sheer cover, but I am so happy with bare minerals that I haven't really felt the need to try something else. Hope this helps...................................... Just a quick addition, after reading the answer below. I haven't had a breakout since I started using it other than your occasional blemish due to hormonal changes that you sometimes get due to pregnancy or your period. And I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.|`|c21f52f98718e01558380e0e7fac21cbaa	I totally agree with the first answer! I too am a user of Bare Minerals too and it's the best makeup you can buy! Not only do they deliver it to you when you need, but you can easily change colors online if you need to. I have been using Bare Minerals for around 4 months now. I have tried other makeups and Bare Minerals is by far the easiest and most effective makeup out there right now. It's healthy for your skin, you can sleep in it, and it's easy to use. It has great coverage also. It covers rosashia, acne, imperfections, ect. with no messy concealers!(Which means it matches bc its the same as ur foundation hurray!)  Bare minerals can be used on any skin type. I personally have very sensitive skin and cant use many products, but i have no trouble with this one.|`|ca595b642af945ce120b47c1e5e6a7a2aa	i used bare minerals before, but i stopped coz i heard that it has an ingredient  called "bismuth oxychloride" which would possibly irritate skin and cause breakouts. so i switched to everyday minerals. i have to say it's the best coz   it works exactly the same, but the price is way cheaper and it doesn't contain bismuth oxychloride. they even have 4 different formulas to choose from:matte, semi matte, original glo and intensive depending on your skin type. i just love the fact that it's so natural, so economic, and does nothing harm to my skin even if wearing it everyday. they give out free samples for first time customer.(only pay shipping)   i once wanted to try sheer color, but i saw it has bismuth in it, so i didn't even bother to do so.  at last, i wanna give a shout out to all the bare escentuals users. YOU SHOULD ALL  GIVE EVERYDAY MINERALS A TRY!! i bet that once you try everyday minerals, you'll never go back to BE again.

If you wash them in the evening they should be dry by morning. I use baby shampoo to wash mine, but they do sell commercial brush cleaners if you are interested.

Eles dizem que reprovam estrias, reprovam celulite, reprovam os culotes e um pouquinho de barriga.  Baby, vocs realmente conhecem mulheres de verdade? Ou dizem isso porque no sonho de vcs, idealizam uma mulher perfeita como aquelas que posam para a playboy e s?o totalmente distorcidas no PhotoShop?    Eii!! Se liga... mulher que  mulher, tem sim celulite. Mulher que  mulher tem um pouquinho de estrias.  sinal que elas ficaram mais gostosas. Mulher que  mulher tem uma gordurinha a mais em alguma parte do corpo, mesmo que ningum perceba.    Se vocs reprovam todas estas caractersticas naturais femininas,  porque h algo de errado. Talvez vcs prefiram homens, que n?o tem nada destas "anomalias fsicas" por vocs citadas.    Concordo que mulheres devam se cuidar para que n?o fiquem com a bund@ parecendo uma laranja, ou a barriga parecendo massa de p?o. Mas mesmo assim a perfei??o n?o ser conquistada.    N?o sejam t?o crticos, pois vcs sabem que precisam de ns. Com ou sem celulite, estrias e gordurinhas.    Um beijo a todos, e desculpem a sinceridade.    Thiago CR - T? contigo, amei sua resposta. Parabns, vc  um cara muito sensato e inteligente. Tenho certeza que conhece as mulheres profundamente.  Beijos!

Vamos nos fixar apenas nas mulheres.  Do ponto de vista estritamente sexual, os homens consideram a mulher bonita quando tem um corpo escultural, que os estimula apenas de olhar.  Quando querem namorar, procuram uma que tenha um rosto lindo (para esnobar os amigos); um corpo bonito (porm n?o exuberante, pois preocupam-se com "chifres"); carinhosa (pois gostam que lhes trate como a m?e); feminina (porque gostam de mulher submissa) e, de preferncia, muiiiito rica (porque podem usar o dinheiro da mulher para n?o precisar trabalhar e, ainda assim, "dar em cima" das outras).  Quando a mulher a ser analisada est em uma revista masculina, a a coisa fica difcil (para as mulheres, pois se n?o tiver um rosto lindssimo e um corpo escultural, as revistas ir?o ficar nas bancas.  Resumindo: os homens, de uma maneira geral, s?o hipcritas e exigentes quando o assunto  o corpo das mulheres e, no entanto, n?o se preocupam se est?o carecas, gordos, magros.   muita "folga", n?o acha.   hora das mulheres adotarem o "olho-por-olho, dente-por-dente".

It is very convenient because no one likes scrubbing their sink for an hour after dying their hair with a Sink Sav*r there is no clean up, you just ball it up and throw it away leaving your sink looking just like new.  It only cost about $1.50 per liner but if you would like a free sample to test it out email me at sinksaver2007@yahoo.com and I will mail you a free sample.  I hope you try it because I have been dying my hair for years in my sink and the Sink Sav*r makes dying your hair so much easier.

Straightening wet hair with straighteners or tongs increases your chances of breakage.    I think someone has said that ceramics are not damaging to your hair but all heated appliances can cause damage to your hair.  That's why it is important to always use heat protective products alongside using heated appliances.    I would say it's best to buy a really good ceramic straightener, eg GHD, and always use heat protective products when using any heated appliance in order to minmise damage.  Also, try not to use your straighteners everyday, it's good to give the hair a break.

Some people say they're just as bad or worse but I dont agree.  But actually its more the hairdryer that damages your hair, it drys it out a lot & can burn your scalp just as much as straighteners!!!

I've been using that iron for a year now, and it not only does not harm my hair, but it gives it the best straightening I've ever had.  It doesn't damage, my hair feels very soft and smooth. It takes alittle work, but it straightens very well and it lasts a long time.  The hair also has a very shiny, silky look. Also, not having to blow dry saves time, and you can still use it on dry hair with great results.  However if your hair is very curly, or difficult to straighten, try the maxi glide.  It has pins on the iron like a brush that pull the hair straight much easier and quicker.  Personally I like the results of the remington better, but I use both of them at different times depending on how I want my hair to look.|`|AA12397402	they are actually really bad for your hair any think hot can damage hair the best straighteners to use are ghd definitely
8531db81252551328ef6636e4d03abe1aa	I think singapore is VERY expensive to get clothes tailored. If you have $1200 for suits, in Bangkok you could get around 5 good quality suits. $1200 for 2 suits is the price of suits back in UK. No use flying all the way to Singapore and paying the same price for suits. Pay $50 for a flight to Bkk from Singapore and get your suits there. My tailors is Crown Tailor on Sukhumvit Road soi 8, and if in Singapore, if you still insist, then the one mentioned above has a good reputation, but its expensive.|`|059157c883e627df7200d12a9c65f9e7aa	My hubby got his suits tailor made at "Men's Tradition" @ Peninsular Plaza.

0904e5c9c0f4dd18db9333ffefa47c85aa	I have to use a light eyebrow pencil to fill in my brows - it was tricky at first, but now it's easy.  The best way to do it is to use a dull pencil - you don't want sharp lines, and lightly drag it backward through the area you're filling in.  LIGHTLY is key.    I'll also use a powder with an angled brow brush - that's actually easier than a pencil.|`|bc9c1fbb1a977346e6c9fafe574c15aaaa	with a eyebrow pencil...|`|AA10737493	use pencil eyeliner I sometimes fill my eyebrows in when i mess up tweezing them|`|b047c73099bc9a37fd3e3539b7235504aa	dont draw them. but if u insist that you do use an eyebrow pencil.|`|4bd7a4416c59a1bde9e95e4e73219626aa	Drawing on eyebrows looks bad in my opinion..but if you have too then use an eyebrow pencil and make it in a curve that looks right on your face|`|7de73e4fc1550ad60e730794e99fd785aa	no|`|3873679744b1a8ac0eae806f8c1774fbaa	It's pretty complicated and it might not look the way you want it to if you're not sure on how to draw your eyebrows.

One that can't possibly go wrong even if you try it the first time.    Use the mascara to try to darken the eyebrows.. just like you do the eyelashes. Apply the mascara, bottom to top on the eyebrows, along its entire length. There is no need to draw it out here. This also works in many cases.    Good Day :-)
AA10907856	Personally I do it all the time and it is pretty easy.Tou take a small brush ( not a round one ,a flat one).Then you start strand by strand.You start combing your hair downwards (with direction to the roots).You may then see your hair like a tangled and confused mass but dont worry.Gently comb your hair-very gently- and slowly in order not to loose all the volume you created.then use some hairspray|`|81c0c648c1caa1976d61cab92a815983aa	Hairstyle Tips and tricks / Winter Haircare  Tips on How to do Perms/Bob hairstyles/Cornrows  How to do Layering / French braid / African-ethnic hairstyles  Tips on Hair coloring / Hair Dyeing tips  http://homebeautytips.blogspot.com    Hairstyle photo gallery -http://geebal.blogspot.com|`|b9210af84213772b7934d72a1ec4f913aa	i dont know go to a salon ans ask them and plus you have no pix that i can see to help you|`|f616cf3be04cd70a9c73b930ae60a9edaa	they use a special shampoo and condtioner|`|29388979beb233b303b3b3e1f19e1fd7aa	i'm not really sure but wht i do is take how much hair i want and pull it back tightly and pin it down. then take ur fingers and put it under the hair and pull up which will get the bump u want. thts wht i do atleast

The best thing to do is use a toner before you moisturize & then use Clean & Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets when you notice you're getting shiny.      As for your eye makeup, use an eye primer before you apply shadow.  Paula Dorf makes a good one.  Just dab a little all over your lid & blend it well.  Then apply a powder over it before you apply shadow.  That should help your eye makeup last longer.

At best, they slow down the process of androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness), and in many cases they don't even do that. Fortunately, there's an all-natural method for you to prevent further hair loss and to regrow hair--it's called Provillus.     Provillus, an oral supplement, works to block DHT, a form of testosterone that is responsible for 95 percent of hair loss. It also works to stimulate the scalp and bring dead follicles back to life. You can use Provillus as a preventative tool, starting the program before hair loss becomes severe, or you can use it after DHT has already begun to take hold of your hair and scalp.|`|444a662f8979f8bc0119a4e0ec68d4e3aa	depends on your age  and diet and stress levels|`|08a6618600f9dcf7ba8eaa05e6e924beaa	well i don't exactly know what to tell you here, but i do know my hair falls out pretty bad too. i can run my fingers through my hair and it comes out like its nothing. i'd  advise going and getting some vitamins from a health store. they do work wonders. as for the dandruff i always used head and shoulders shampoo and it worked fine for me. sorry if that didn't help much.|`|311d74c2cb0b6deac2a08c845d3bb4c8aa	Visit a doctor!

But if not I'd just recommend de-stressing, try to take it easy for a bit or how about getting an Indian head massage? there excellent for de-stressing and good for your scalp and hair. There not to expensive and different kind of oils can be used to treat different problems    I also used to suffer with dandruff but found out it was a result of a dairy intolerance, once i stopped the dairy it almost went completely, to get rid of it totally i tried alsorts t-gel head and shoulders etc and found them all pretty useless and damaged my hair then i found a shop called Lush which does all organic shampoo bars which are amazing i've been flake free for over 6th month now and my hairs so shiney so would defo recomend them they have a website too if you just google them.    good luck :)

You will need to invest in a good deep conditioning treatment which you can buy at some place like Sally's Beauty Supply store, but make sure that you do not over use the conditioner because you do not want your hair to become over conditioned, which is another problem.  After you shampoo your hair put a plastic bag on and sit under a hooded dryer for 15 mins and then wash out. If you use alot of heat on your hair. STOP.  It also causes your hair to become dry and brittle.  Anytime before you use heat on your hair make sure that it is coated with some type of oil or serum so that it wont break and become brittle.
AA11220927	You go to a salon as soon as possible. I repeat go to a salon NOW!!!    Do not reach for that blonde dye, do not use lemons, do not touch that bleach.    Its sounds like you done very little research on hair dye. It is much harder to go darker that it is to go lighter. Although the box says brown, but it has red tones that shows up in light blonde hair.     Go to a salon and have the professional repair it.

GO NOW!!! before the dyes sets in permanently.|`|5824edf7ac71744c0dbd2dd425cd9613aa	well  to  get  rid  of  the  red  you  will  wanna re tint it  with a  tint  with a green base...Green  will take  away  from the red.....If after  this  it  still  looks  bad  you  can bleach it  back  to the  color you  had....depending  on what condition  your  hair is in you  can try a  color remover  but i  dont recommend you  to  do this,,,,you can damage your hair  with  thoses  hair stripers.....im a  hair dresser  and ive  seen it  happen the  best bleach  to  get  is  called 7 stage  its  made  by miss  clariol  you  can  buy  this  at  any  beauty supply  store if  you  go  with another  brand  please make sure it says on scalpe  bleach|`|bcd3ad5de36b68ccc02af0c6b0d203aeaa	you can dye it again, ive done that before just dye it a lighter color, if not just wash it over and over again with V05 shampoo, it takes dye out faster than any other shampoo|`|1ff302e8116fd6fbad10d5adf1ac6c2faa	redye it|`|487c78f8ad4c50177d388dc663586038aa	omg! that happened to me!!!!!!! go to your local beauty supply and then get a color strip (preferably from Clairol it works best!) then follow the instruction on the back.
