And I think the sky may indeed be falling. I'm glad they news is reporting what's going on, and what could happen. I like having the chance to prepare for bad times.

cPuicv06aa	The child who was murdered was Caylee Marie Anthony, a precious little 2 year old.  Her mother, Casey Anthony displayed bizarre behavior by not reporting her child missing and then going out partying.  She repeatedly lied to the police.  No mother in their right mind would do what she did.|`|482oQASHaa	Casey Anthony is the mother,, who kill her 3 year old child. who was name Caylee anthony . and  she lie about it.. she make everyone believe there was still hope out there. that her child was alive. when she was the one who kill  a little angel.. hopefully Casey Anthony  will be put to her death|`|YxwA5sjwaa	Caylee Anthony is important because she was an innocent two year old child who was born to the wrong mother - a woman who murdered her child with no feeling, because the baby got in her way.  It's the innocence of this child that bothers everyone, and of course she was a delight to all who knew her.  Casy Anthony poisons all she touches, from her friends, to her relatives, to her brother and parents, to her baby.  Everyone is disposable, and must bend to Casey's wants and needs.  She even took a complete stranger and ruined her name, all for her own selfish reasons of covering up the murder of  Caylee.  She stole from her friends, and broke the heart of one boyfriend because she thought he loved Caylee more than her!  This woman will not stop if she is let out.  That's why she must never go free again.
K9yb2nDHaa	I think you first need to decide where exactly your interests lie. I'm an editor at a marketing firm, and my job is completely different to that of, say a copywriter. Writers work much more closely with the marketing and communications folks to craft the message and wording, whereas my role is to make sure that message is conveyed correctly--and check for errors of course. If your goal is to be a writer, I'd hone in on your marketing/communications know-how. But if you want to be a true editor, focus on that. Take a copyediting course online to start to get your basic skills.|`|og5R9Ayhaa	I'd say your better bet would be the "Print Communication" route, since marketing techniques will take you into a different arm of journalism than it sounds like you're after. <br>  <br>  For the most part, an eye for detail is what you really need to be able to prove. Many media companies will offer edit tests to ensure that an applicant can tell the difference between "their | there | they're" and "its | it's", as well as basic grammar. So make sure you already have a solid grasp of these concepts, or neither degree will do the trick for you.<br>  <br>  You might want to seek out a small publication for which you could freelance copyedit, even if you don't make much (if any) money right away. That would allow you to include a copy editing entry on your resume, and have a reference who could vouch for your skills.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

OsnCPSsoaa	I do not like Fox News and would not be upset to the smallest degree if they were to go out of business.  I think you are talking about how people are talking about the "fairness doctrine".  Fox News is a right wing, conservative, republican channel and the current administration and government is democratic.  Fox News and some people believe that the fairness doctrine will hurt them at "what they do" and limit them or even shut them down.  I do not think this will happen.  Fox News will not go out of business because they have the most amount of viewers out of all the Cable News Networks.  I hope this answers your question.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Not a chance! <br>  <br>  You don't like Fox New?  Don't watch Fox News! Just what is it you are afraid of?

aEeCCHVlaa	Yes, it was a bad thing that happened, but one cannot speculate on what has happened to the other missing men, except to conclude that they did not survive.  Depending upon currents, they could have drifted many miles from the capsized point;  they could have disappeared beneath the water; as gruesome as it sounds, eaten by sharks/ alligators; swept out into deeper water.

9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	In one personal way I am glad because my son works for Citigroup and because of this bail-out he will (most likely) get to keep his job.  In every other way I am opposed to it because I don't like bail-outs.  I am sure this is how many view these things.

This in-itself cost the Governments dearly or should I say the Tax Payer. This time it is the same with Governments propping up the banks so credit and cash can flow into the social demand for products creating employment.<br>  <br>  There has to be a level playing field where large corporation profits and employment strategies are concerned. There has been a failure by Governments to enforce Directors Guarantee when corporations fail and go under. Those Directors should be looked into to see if they have ripped the guts out of the profit margin allowing the company to fold.

8I9uduIiaa	Excellent, excellent post.<br>  <br>  What's happening in Darfur is atrocious. We should all be outraged.<br>  <br>  Yet it was the events in Gaza that generated worldwide hysteria - when some 600 Palestinians, mostly Hamas terrorists, were killed in RESPONSE to their years of attacks on Israeli civilians.<br>  <br>  Note that Muslims only seem to shriek in protest when their fellow Muslims are being brought to task for terrorism. Where are the Muslim protests when MUSLIMS MURDER MUSLIMS?<br>  <br>  They are strangely silent, are they not...?<br>  <br>  Reporters who are actually in Gaza now, report that there was nothing like the 'devastation' described in the media. Already, several newspapers have had to apologise TO Israel for FALSELY accusing her of things that never even happened - for instance the bombing of a UN  school that the IDF never touched!<br>  <br>  The Palestinians have been terrorising Israel for years. They get funding to the tune of millions a year from their puppet masters in Iran and Syria. And the world loves them.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the sliver of land that is Israel is the only country in the middle east where ARAB WOMEN GET TO VOTE.<br>  <br>  Yet Israel is hated.<br>  <br>  As Alan Dershowitz put it: 'Israel is the Jew among the nations'. The same hatred historically shown to Jews is NOW being directed at the Jewish state, and just as UNFAIRLY.|`|QoFpoeuWaa	Mainly,it′s not "people" who are mad at Israel-but muslims,especilly arab muslims,and their liberal sidekicks in the West,all this gang of liberal professors,lawyers,journalists and similar categories of people for whom main work is to talk and who are easily driven by the "rrrrrrevolutionary" phraseology.<br>  As a result,when Jews beat up the arabs who attack them-the arabs immedately start to scream about "freedom","liberation" and  "colonialism",<br>  and these "useful idiots" immediately fall in the trap.<br>  And in Darfur,it′s muslims who kill ,rape and pillage non-Muslims,and no one cries about "revolution" and "freedom-fighting".|`|25EHpBTsaa	The article mentioned 2002, if this happened so long ago and the story is just now getting out...I'm sure many things happen like this go unreported. <br>  <br>  Media has much to do with what concerns seem important. When I watch American News, it seems like their is little news regarding the World.  When I go to France, American News and International News is broadcasted more. Makes me think that many Americans are just living in the US and not truly aware of whats going on in the World. <br>  <br>  Fifty years ago, I don't think many people really worried about what went on across the world unless it affected us.  Now, with technology it just about everyone can have an opinion. <br>  <br>  As with anything, people don't just get involved for no reason. I think its these reasons we must try to figure out and our values, ethics, etc kick in and decide whether it was good or bad judgment. <br>  <br>  What happened in Darfur is truly a horrible thing! The more people become aware of this, hopefully they get the assistance they need.|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	Maybe its because Sudan is part of the Arab League and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the main groups that push for endless condemnations and special sessions of Israel's self-defence at the UN while totally ignoring the Sudanese dictatorship in Darfur.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_the_Islamic_Conference" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisatio...</a>|`|ECbyFWLCaa	The Arab countries has to accept Israel exists, and treat the Palestinians like other arabs. As it is now, they are held in poverty so everybody is to see how mean Israel is. But if you understand it's the Arab nations not accepting their loss - or "loss", Israel belonged to the Jews before the arabs took it, so the arabs have just lost land they had stolen, like Spain was taken back from them- this will not work on you.<br>  <br>  Imaging all the arabs expelled from Spain living in eternal and miserable camps in the northern Morocco while everybody tried to make it look like the Spaniards was incredible evil to have retaken their land- it would have been the same thing. The only reason this is happening, is the Arab nations think they can convince the world into thinking Israel should be destroyed. The solution is to make the arabs accepting their loss, and accepting the palestinians into Saudi-Arabia, Jordan and Egypt as citizens. As it is now, there are laws against giving the palestinians citizenship in those countries, because it would harm their claim of getting "back" Palestine! So the arabs hates Israel more than they love their own people. No other tribe has ever treated their own people this bad.<br>  <br>  In Darfur, the culprits are Muslims. This means all the money and resources the Muslim world uses to make the Israeli-Palestinian "conflict" top news, also makes the world pay less attention to Darfur. So, the Muslim leaders are probably very happy about the situation.|`|iHP2v107aa	read an article about that and your right it is  bad.<br>  WHAT HAS BEEN THE  COST OF THE WAR?<br>  <br>   Just a short time ago there was a cold war between the two most powerful countries in the world.  The USSR and the USA!<br>  But something changed all that when the USSR went to war with Afghanistan.<br>  Eventually it left the country broke, and they went into a deep depression that taxed the people to their limit and the death and  carnage left them without any respect for the government who sent those young men to die.<br>  <br>   Some small municipalities decided they wanted no more of the government tax and spend on a war which they did not want in the first place.  So a civil war broke out and some of these places succeeded from the Union.  Some of them are now small countries with their own government, who never fully recovered from the poverty that was brought on by that war.  Today there is no more USSR and it is a nation in poverty hardly a major power as it once was.<br>  <br>   They just keep picking away, with a terror attack here and one there. until they destroy a nation.  They are relentless, because it only takes one man to keep a bunch of women pregnant and raising men to fight and that frees the rest up to continue the battle.  Which they have so successfully done for at least the last 2000 years.  Then there is Africa?  The Islamic forces marched down from the North and have pretty much killed anyone in their path.  Africa has seen the worse genocide in the history of the world.<br>  It makes Hitler look like a peaceful man.  Have they stopped?  Not anywhere in the world.  They have a civil war going on in Pakistan, India and between Israel and surrounding nations.  <br>  <br>   So when we are all Muslim then the war will stop and only then?  Not hardly during the 1980’s they had a ten year war between Iraq and Iran in which over a million died and billions in property damage.  Both sides were Islamic.  Hussein gassed the Kurds who were the same religion.  It is very hard to fight a religion that tells a man and convinces him that when he dies in this war he goes to heaven to have 70 virgins forever.  The best thing to do is leave them alone.  Let them kill each other.<br>  <br>   Now we face some important facts in the USA, it is going into a very deep depression due to the economic drain of the war.  Which has been very unpopular.<br>  People have lost sons and daughters and husbands and fathers to this war which seems to never end.  Some states cannot pay their bills and are about bankrupt and the other states are not anxious to bail them out with high taxes and government spending.  Texas has declared it wants to succeed from the Union and Louisiana wants to join them.  Saying we do not want stimulus money but we do not want to pay taxes to pay for this either.  Oklahoma and New Mexico will go along with anything that happens in Texas.  They are basically all the same state.<br>  <br>   You have to wonder when Louisiana Republican Governor says it is a land in chaos that means it is in chaos. When they do not want any part because it is to wild that is like the governor of Indiana saying that man is to corrupt for Chicago.<br>  You know that man is corrupt.  They have even elected a president Chuck Norris is going to be their new president.  Imagine that guys they are predicting the new battle ground will be fought in Arizona and they will become their own country.<br>  Texas isn’t kidding.  It has always been thought of as its own country.<br>  So the war in Iraq has delivered us to what Russia faced a few years earlier.<br>  So should we stay until the civil war breaks out here or get out of Iraq?|`|tod8jy9Paa	I thought that Israel were a civilized nation and one would have thought they had learded come compassion from their brutal treatment in WW2 but neither seems to be the case.

They're taking massive donations from folks in my synagogue and they have planning meetings for how to focus their efforts.  The only time people get mad about Jews being at war is when they join the hate.  <br>  <br>  Of course we don't care, there's no money in it for the USA, which is despicable if you ask me.|`|QI74CxD0aa	A lot of people do care about Darfur.<br>  <br>  The International Criminal Court in the Hague has recently issued a warrant for the arrest of the President of the Sudan for war crimes and violations of human rights.<br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090304/ap_on_re_mi_ea/eu_international_court_darfur">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090304/ap_o...</a><br>  <br>  Lots of people care about human rights violations no matter where in the world they occur.

Its easier to hate and blame someone else for yours and the worlds troubles than it is to be humble and take a look at your own failings, or take responsibility for your own problem... <br>  <br>  Its like - having a bad day ? blame the jews . bus not running on time ? blame the jews and their fingers in every pie ? Islamic terrorist blows himself up ?well - he was only fighting back against those evil jews ... you get the idea <br>  <br>  anti semtism and anti israel thinking is for people too stupid, lazy and ignorant to think for themselves.<br>  <br>  and as far as the muslim ummah goes... they care so much about their fellow muslims .. yet while those muslims starve to death in sudan or are tortured and oppressed or blown up daily - by other muslims no less - in afghanistan and iraq... they would rather hate on israel than help them...<br>  <br>  no boycott iraq campains you see... no collections and rants against injustice for darfur.,... of course not... because they arent jews .. and helping them would mean they would have to address the faults and failings within their own faith....<br>  <br>  far easier instead to blame jews for everything than do that....<br>  <br>  Its an age old problem that wont change until muslims and the rest of the world can learn to stop blaming others - ie jews -  for their problems

I am also surprised that Labour party hasn't called for him to step down before they are totally well and truly finished at the same time. <br>  <br>  Whilst we see different measures being announced by leaders of different countries around the world, months later we still listen to Brown unleash his crap without actually taking any decisive action what so ever.<br>  <br>  What also pissed me off immensely is the fact that Brown is somehow being compared to the savior of the universe. Have any of you seen Nick Robinson's report on Brown's visit to USA?? Robinson stood next to Winston Churchill's statue whilst yet again talking pretty much same GOB SH*TE as Brown. Comparing the two would be like comparing a Fiat 126 with a Ferarri. Not only it was done in extremely bad taste but in my opinion it is a total DISGRACE!! W. Churchill was a remarkable man, Brown on the other hand is a waste of space!!!<br>  <br>  I think it has gone beyond the opinion polls or the argument of which political party would actually save us all from the current economic doom. What is clear that there is no transparency, no accountability and there seems to be no common sence within British politics anymore.

5gG2OfHIaa	Madoff is awaiting trial or a plea bargain.   Since he is 70 years old and under house confinement at his apartment, he represents no appreciable flight risk and is not a threat to commit a violent crime.  Reading between the lines, I think he must be providing the various law enforcement arms some actionable information in collecting evidence on potential co-defendants.   As to the negative Jewish commentary,  I have read that most of the fund investors who lost large to their entire savings were Jewish people and Jewish charities.  I really think the bail conditions of the court are within the norms of reason.  I understand your frustration over the court's handling of this case; but, a U.S. District Ct. judge has the power of a monarch.  We do not have a judge who is seeking reelection; therefore,  I think the court action is balanced between protecting the public and promoting disclosure of further evidence of other participants.  I would be reluctant to implicate anyone beyond Madoff until all the cards are on the table.|`|HBV9GGXDaa	It seems he was the former head of NASDAQ and his wife and his employees were all insiders at all the top Wall Street firms and banks at one point or another.<br>  <br>  No one believes this guy acted alone.  <br>  <br>  My consipiracy theory is that Madoff and his fellow family and firm of crooks simply have too much dirt on those who would prosecute them.

Why do the Arabs think it is okay to attack Israel with a view to removing it from the map altogether, but when they lose say I want my land back.<br>  Would the Arabs have given the land back to Israel if they had managed to defeat her in any of their attempts? Thought not.<br>  <br>  Is this anti-Jewish hypocrisy - expecting the Jews to operate in a way that their enemies would not? Thought so.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	yes, good for israel, they were attacked many times and kept the land like so many other nations have done.<br>  but the map is not accurate as Israel was established in 1948, with unclear borders.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	that pretty much sums it up, Britain gave the jews a homeland, and they took it, PLUS all the rest of Palestine|`|gYgXn2weaa	Left unchallenged the whole middle east will be coloured white but tainted with the blood of Gentiles..|`|2VeQdw03aa	454545|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	Yes, I can't see how anyone could argue with that.|`|QoFpoeuWaa	I do not know what you meant by this very significantly-looking but absolutely senseless phrase about Israel being "informally" created after the WWI - but "officially created in 1948".But what I know for sure is that the arabs are the total sons of..their mothers.<br>  By the partition plan of the UN, the Jewish State was to be comprised of roughly 5,500 square miles and the population was to be 538,000 Jews and 397,000 Arabs. The Arab State was to be 4,500 square miles with a population of 804,000 Arabs and 10,000 Jews.<br>  So,44% of the population of the "Jewish State" were meant to be arabs,while only 11% of the population of the arab state was planned to be Jewish.I think it′s absolutely unfair.But what is sickening is that the arabs thought that even this was too much-and started the aggression against Israel.<br>  Israel beat them up and took a bit of their territory?Good for her,well done Israel,this is how any aggressor should be treated.|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	Israel's borders grew from Arab wars launched against it.

IVF chances of success also diminish with age, after 35 it is especially low and you definately need more attempts.  To add to that older mothers have harder pregnancies, labours and more likely to have disabled children or children with problems.  I am all for women getting a career first, but giving the option of IVF over the years has encourage men not to commit and women to see it as an option if they leave it too long.

This doctrine is aimed only at radio. Because there are so many popular conservative talk radio shows. They don't care about fairness in TV, or print. Only radio. But democrats are trying to disguise the fairness doctrine because a bill just passed that said the fairness doctrine could not be applied. So democrats created a new bill that promotes diversity in radio station ownership. In other words trying to break up the big syndicators who carry the national conservative talk radio shows.

If he really cared then wouldn't he be more active? He's an entertainer that didn't graduate from college that is fat and lazy. He's a drug addict. He was losing his hearing. He didn't listen to the other side anyway and still doesn't. He's married to a fitness trainer - hmmm - wouldn't you think that he would be in better shape? Don't you think he would be more informed? Where does he get his information? <br>  <br>  Do you believe that he pores over data? I don't. No way.<br>  <br>  Here's a big clue - if he were studious then he would have graduated from college!

They don't need the support of those republican senators anyway, so they shouldn't even be concerned with their opinions or how they vote. As for Rush Limbaugh, he already IS the poster child for the GOP- I think he is the perfect individual to represent them, as he espouses every single belief and viewpoint your classical republican voter typically has. Dems are also free to attack him, though i think it's a waste of time- what's wrong with it as long as Rush is not prevented from doing his radio show? How is this an attack on free press? they are merely stating an opinion when they counter Rush's verbal assaults- no one is trying to take his free speech away.|`|93kfeHDKaa	Gearge Bush considered suspending the First Amendment.

It is positive to have tv business news people who are not stuck in one gear in reporting the business news.   Economics does not seem to be divorced from the job description of a business news commentator and reporter.  Wellesley is a strong academic school.|`|OsnCPSsoaa	I like Michelle Caruso-Cabrerra if that is who you are talking about.  A lot of times women become anchors because of their looks and personalities.  She is intelligent though.
AA11305474	Great analogy, LOL|`|AA11557192	I do not know what der speigel is.  <br>  <br>  However I see Fox news has a right tilt just as I see left ward tilt in NBC or CNN.  Everyone has a bias and it influences the stories they cover, how they cover it, the words they choose, etc.<br>  <br>  If the bias agrees with your bias then they seem unbiased.  If it does not agree with yours, then they are clearly letting their bias effect their reporting.
HJaVcUGwaa	Israel only welcomes UN and international envoys that support, with no questions asked, every action Israel does.  Israel picks and chooses whichever UN resolutions it likes, and ignores the rest (the rest here being the most).<br>  <br>  Also it seems Israel has an issue with UN envoys that have a Falk or a Folke in their names.  In 1948, Israeli assassins in Israeli military uniforms assassinated UN special envoy Count Folke Bernadoute.  It was reported that the assassination was ordered by former Israeli PM Yitzhak Shamir.  Even though the assassins were known, none were charged with the killing.  All but one did not get any prison terms, and one became a member of the first Knesset.  Talk about a terrorist state!|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	first of all, get the context right.<br>  israel RESPONDED to unceasing rocket fire aimed indiscriminately at its civilian poplulation for 3 years , after pulling out of the gaza strip.<br>  this assault on israel is a breach of the geneva convention, and israel legally and correctly defended its citizens by attacking the hamas cowards in their hiding places among their own civilian poulation, another breach of the geneva convention.<br>  So israel did not just out of the blue invade gaza.<br>  by spreading this kind of  non contextual disinformation you promote hatred and violence and anti semitism/anti zionism.<br>  Hamas only wants war it is them you should be investigating.|`|CmG8oTH0aa	For his own safety.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	He has been asked for his own view:-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/19/israel-palestinian-territories-united-nations" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/...</a><br>  <br>  which would appear to be that Israel denied him entry because they don't like the way he reports their actions to his bosses at the UN.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  I have to take issue with ggopri. December 14th is a long way from May, and immediately prior to recent hostilities.|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	I think Richard Falk has been denied entry into Israel a few times, don't think that's considered expulsion, mainly because of his anti-Israel views, he also believes in 9/11 conspiracy theories.<br>  <br>  Gibraltar has around the same density in populated areas as Gaza, they are not firing rockets at Spanish towns.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._Falk#Controversy_and_Criticisms" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cou...</a>|`|JH8lpdKiaa	i think a county has a right to declare someone as "unwanted personality". falk just pissed too many people off after comparing israel to the nazis so he's just unwanted here anymore.|`|QoFpoeuWaa	You′re writing stupidities.First,Falk was not UN Envoy,he was UN Special Rapporteur on situations of humans rights of Palestinians .Second,Israel banned Falk ′s entry into Israel not "days before invasion" into Gaza,but in May 2008,when  Israel refused to allow Falk to enter Israel and  declared him to be "unwanted person" in Israel.And with a very good reason,let′s be sincere;such a scum who supports iranian Ayatollah Khomeini(read his op-ed for the New York Times entitled "Trusting Khomeini") and who defended Karleton Armstrong  has nothing to do in Israel.|`|PIIKJ3Cqaa	Because he is a well known bigot. The reasons were well documented at the time. Where have you been hiding?|`|URl4r7N1aa	To try and cover up the Genocide they had planned!<br>  Just to be clear, Hamas has never fired a rocket into Israel, just illegally occupied Palestine!|`|luWMdsrOaa	He left because his life was threatened by radical Muslims from the gaza.|`|GDwMdfqjaa	Richard Falk being expelled from Israel and the war in Gaza are 2 seperate events which have no link between them whatsoever. Richard Falk is a persona non-grata in Israel. Each country has a list of individuals which aren't welcome in the country, and for Israel, Richard Falk is one of them. The main reason being that he spews propaganda, makes up fake figures and critisizes Israel, and only Israel, no matter what it does or what he knows. For example, in the recent conflict which was a response to Hamas shooting rockets and not yielding to warnings and requests to stop, even before the smoke screen went away, even before official figures and information was released, Richard Falk immediately jumped and claimed "Israel is commiting crimes against humanity in Gaza".<br>  <br>  His general views are distorted. He called for further investigation of 9/11 claiming it was organized by the U.S. government, he supported the Iranian religious revolution 30 years ago which later led to the kidnap of numerous American hostages, he opposed the war in Vietnam promoting ideas taken from the Nazi nuremberg trials and he defended Karleton Armstrong, who pleaded guilty to bombing the University of Wisconsin Army Mathematics Research Center. The list goes on and on.<br>  <br>  By now, you probably figured out what kind of person he is, But his favorite subject is criticizing Israel for every action it takes in a way that wouldn't shame a radical Muslim or a Nazi.<br>  <br>  As a result - He's not welcome in Israel. He knew in advance that Israel won't let him in, such is the status of a persona non-grata, but he still decided to come there, just to cause a controversy and get his name on the news.
CmG8oTH0aa	Nope. He is just making a fool out of  the people who think he is anymore than a bad comedian.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	He absolutely is. He has now enacted the Fairness Doctrine in order to give Obama, not a stand in, a debate live for 3 hours, at Rush's not the tax payers, expense.  Obama won't show unless he wants to look more stupid than he actually is. For those who think that Rush appointed himself a leader of the opposition party, you're absolutely wrong. Dems titled Limbaugh with that title so keep up if you can we all know you libs have a tough time. I give credit to the libs on here. They are following the liberal tradition. Lie when ever possible. <br>  <br>  You libs have dug this hole for your self again. You'll never get out without that brown stuff all over your faces, as usual.|`|un0C52G8aa	No, I think he's making a fool out of himself. He's appointed himself as some sort of leader of the opposition party even though he has never held elected office or even run for it. What makes him think he is more qualified to lead a political party than the man who actually was selected to lead it?|`|Y6odIQgJaa	There's no way that blowhard could make a fool out of anyone but himself.  And his dittoheads are just as foolish.<br>  <br>  Obama is so far above Rush's blustering b.s.|`|T1ZxG3rcaa	Rush says things for publicity, he doesnt really care either way hes getting paid.
4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	Rush is the Leader of the Republican Party.  The Republican Party listens to him.  So yes, it works for the Democratic Party, since they choice to listen to a big fat slub like Rush.|`|oojO4WAraa	Wow.  I don't know.  Rush does have some influence among his listeners, and he did have a big hissy fit when M Steele pointed out that Rush was an entertainer, not a politician.  Maybe Rush likes to think of himself more as a political force than an entertainer.|`|cHX4PIY7aa	No, totally not. The President should stay the course on his style of governing and not let far right wing talk show hosts like Rush and Sean intimidate him. I for one am a Republican and actually voted for McCain in the election but I fully support our President and his efforts to bring our country out of the current mess that we are in and believe that we can not get bogged down in political finger pointing. This is a waste of time when our country is in an economic free fall with no end in sight. People are loosing their jobs, savings and many with hope of recovery. I think that most Americans are moderates anyway and frankly I consider this ridiculous waste of time between right and left childish and sad. We need to come together and not drive apart or this financial mess will never be over.<br>  <br>  Grow up!!!
POJNnWhDaa	No. If Obama went on the show, Rush would be polite and professional, I have heard him talk to people he disagrees with before, and it has been reported in the news when he bumped into Clinton at a dinner he was polite. Politics are one thing, but Rush is a pro, and he would act like one if Obama called the show, which he never will.|`|YkseyT7zaa	First you have to care about what Rush has to say. Then weight it's value with relevancy on the issues. Once you see that it's not worth the time and effort to even wipe off your shoe. You move on|`|CmG8oTH0aa	The bigger question is Does Rush have the guts to debate ANYONE someplace other then his own show.<br>  <br>  He has not show the courage to do so in the past, mainly because he will no longer control the mikes.|`|Uaoep16Qaa	I think they would be on 2 totally different wave lengths, it wouldnt work. Rush doesnt convey questions and debate in an intelligent way. Which is fine, thats his job, he is JUST a radio talk show host, whose job is to provoke and get ratings..by the way, these are his words. <br>  Rush also only really has to pander to his listeners who are all a very similar demographic with identical views. <br>  Obama is the freaking president lol! so he knows only diplomacy, and would only be able to act in that manner|`|AA10283080	And what purpose would this serve other than seeing a slovenly pill popping pig trying to make himself look better?|`|UBxKqdPwaa	He has more important things to do than to debate a fat windbag.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	Obama would not-doesn't have the guts.|`|AA10698792	Don't forget that Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer, a radio personality and nothing more...he's not a politician.<br>  <br>  His sole reason for bringing anyone to his show for a debate would be to appease and increase his listeners...even if the outcome would go his way...it's all about the ratings. And it is well known that no matter what anyone he disagrees with says, he will STILL disagree and make incendiary statements even when the truth is staring him in the face.  Mind you I'm not saying what that truth is.<br>  <br>  But if you'll recall when he made those pathetic remarks about Michael J. Fox, he didn't apologize until he realized that a great deal of his own fan base was horrified by what he'd said, so to appease his own listeners and hang onto his demographic, he caved.<br>  <br>  That is not the action of someone who is trying to prove a point...that's someone who said something shocking, brainless and controversial to get more ratings and it failed and he had to apologize.<br>  <br>  So whether Obama will take the challenge remains to be seen, but no matter what, Limbaugh will find a way to twist it to support his own agenda and that is neither fair nor responsible, something the Republican Party is trying to assert themselves as again.  It makes me sick that Michael Steele retracted his comments about him and I'm not even a Republican, but if I were, I certainly wouldn't want a blowhard lout like Limbaugh trying to speak for me.|`|f5c19a6ec11055d423269c8c414f59f1aa	Rush Limbaugh is the most dangerous man in the USA today.<br>  He is causing some moderate Republicans to say "yes, we should"<br>   But we have some Radical Republican Extremists in the south that are armed with AK47 assault riffles who are advocating a civil war.<br>  they want Texas to succeed from the union and take New Mexico and Oklahoma with them.  Then the Louisiana Governor Republican doesn't want the stimulus money and he wants to not pay for it either so he is with Texas in saying we want out and we are not paying taxes.  California could not be bailed out no matter how much money you gave them and are moments away from anarchy.<br>  Which Rush is adding fuel to the fire and once it starts  no one will be able to put it out.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Sure because Obama has nothing better to do, right? <br>  <br>  Then debate an entertainer without a college education.<br>  <br>  But Rush is so studious and informed, right? Rrrriiigggghhhtttttt. <br>  A college diploma is just a piece of paper? I did a lot to get mine. I did even more to get my Masters.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Not likely. The reason the talk shows with the biggest audiences (by far) are hosted by conservatives is because they are competent and effective debaters. Obama doesn't stand a chance of winning the debate.|`|YQLTdXhjaa	like obama said, "it's time to put childish things aside"....that man doesn't care about the opinions being said about him, he only cares about fixing America...so let the man do his job!|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	No|`|qeLikL8Haa	whats the point hes just going to get bashed for being president|`|LpqZuU2naa	I think that Obama has too many other things to worry about. I doubt that he'll go on Rush's show - Rush is just shooting off his mouth and being outrageous for ratings and to stir the pot. I think that Rush is doing his job in being an agitator and Obama is doing his, in being the President of Untied States of America. Let them both stick to what they do best.<br>  <br>  Besides, I'm sure Obama would come to a debate, seriously prepared and ready to go with facts and figures, while Rush would probably just be trying to goad him into giving him some inflamitory sound bites that he can play over and over.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	I'm sure he has the guts, but hopefully he has more class than to go on his show.<br>  <br>  Rush is nothing but a hypocrite and a druggy.  Sorry, I really liked him years ago, but he acts so holier-than-thou and points out the shortcomings of others when he is clearly in no position to question their motives and choices.|`|5z85xkfbaa	Are you kidding. Rush knew before offering the debate that the current white house occupant wouldn't take up the challenge.<br>  The only debate that the current white house occupant will take is one which will pit him against other Libretards of high school debate teams....Which are usually controlled by libretard teachers.|`|sU60NqWWaa	I think it would be silly for our president to accept such a challenge.  Rush Limbaugh is a radio talk show host and staunch conservative.  He is not a figure that our president should even consider debating.|`|ymU9QGlUaa	I think he has the sense to ignore him.  Do mature people bow down to a petulant child or ignore it?  The best way to deal with immaturity is to ignore it.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	No way|`|HjZcH6dGaa	Obama has better stuf to do like run our country then debate some old queer.|`|gk0fao0Saa	no hes a big fat *****!!

gW0nD5cEaa	The Anti Christ will come from Europe, out of the territory of the old Roman Empire. He will declare himself Messiah in the Temple in Jerusalem. The Temple, as yet has not been rebuilt. He will declare himself God.<br>  <br>  Obama is from Hawaii, US, and even those naysayers who say he is Kenyan or something, Kenya was never part of the Roman Empire, even remotely. <br>  <br>  I don't know why people are accusing him of these things. Is it because he is Black? Or is it some people have just learned about the Anti-Christ and put the name on anybody they don't like. I don't remember any other politician being accused of it before.|`|mno4Qd5paa	A sample paragraph: "When he was 12 years old, they found him in the temple in the City of Chicago, arguing the finer points of community organization with the Prophet Jeremiah and the Elders. And the Elders were astonished at what they heard and said among themselves: 'Verily, who is this Child that he opens our hearts and minds to the audacity of hope?'"<br>  <br>  Before wrapping up his tour, Obama stopped by to address a gathering of minority journalists in Hawaii, where he once again apologized for what a rotten place America either used to be, or still is. It is hard to tell from his comment, "I personally would want to see our tragic history, or the tragic elements of our history, acknowledged."<br>  <br>  (Wouldn't anybody besides me personally like to see somebody in the White House<br>  who doesn't think America needs apologizing for?)<br>  <br>  Barack has apologized to the French and Germans for Americans who are too ignorant to learn their language before embarking on their once-in-a-lifetime two-week visit abroad.<br>  <br>  He's apologized for the simple Midwestern rednecks who, forced to cling to religion and guns to justify their antipathy, just can't help themselves.<br>  <br>  There was a time when it was considered unpatriotic to be ashamed of America, but that time is long past. Being proud of America means you are probably a Bush-loving neoconservative, so the only sure way to prevent such misidentification is to apologize for it at every opportunity.<br>  <br>  America has never faced so many different crises at the same time in living memory. The war with al-Qaida and Islamic terror, the Iran crisis, Afghanistan, nuclear proliferation, the rising price of oil, the falling dollar, enemy acronyms like OPEC, NAM, OIC, U.N. ... Obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him – a messiah-like figure, charismatic and glib and seemingly holding all the answers to all the world's questions.<br>  <br>  And the Bible says that such a leader will soon make his appearance on the scene. It won't be Barack Obama, but Obama's world tour provided a foretaste of the reception he can expect to receive.<br>  <br>  He will probably also stand in some European capital, addressing the people of the world and telling them that he is the one that they have been waiting for. And he can expect as wildly enthusiastic a greeting as Obama got in Berlin.<br>  <br>  The Bible calls that leader the Antichrist. And it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	I don't know about amusing, but definitely odd. I thought you could find biblical evidence to support just about anything.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Yes, I think its pretty stupid.|`|Bn72Bj2Iaa	Of course there's no evidence. It's amusing alright.  The same thing was said when Ronald Reagan was elected.|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	well if they tried to prove it wouldnt work because how could they prove the bible is real|`|CmG8oTH0aa	Its mainly because they are just parroting Rush and the nasty boys party line.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	Just an immature way to show their displeasure of the president.
