20070726133136AA5y8FV	Beauty & Style;Hair	Good longer messy haircut?	Well a couple years ago, I grew my hair out really long. No clue why, I just didn't feel like cutting it. Anyway, I got tired of having really long hair because I thought it looked horrible on me so I had my Mom cut it(yes, my mom cut my hair :P). She did a pretty good job with it, but I want to go a little bit shorter(it's about Chin length right now). Because i'm pretty sick of the effort to get it to look alright. It usually only looks good if I hop into a shower and let it dry naturally all while periodically curling my hair outwards with my fingers(and odd routine, I know). But even then, it looks a bit frizzy with loose strings of hair popping out all over the place. Anyway, she says if I want to go any shorter i'll have to go to her hair stylist, because she isn't comfortable with her abilities.      I don't want to go to a hair stylist without a specific image in mind, so here I am, looking for ideas.

I've been looking at it in the movie, and I'm pretty competant with makeup but it's hard to make out the details because the film style is so bright.       http://media.collegepublisher.com/media/...       Sadly, it's practically impossible to find a good picture, too. If you check out the movie though, it's pretty apparent...Any tips or tutorials? I'm a big fan of smokey eyes but I usually do them Kat Von D style (Winged out and angled, not rounded like Kiera's.)

But the other night I was at my boyfriends place. We had just come home and were chilling on the couch. As I do sometimes, I put my legs on his lap. I was wearing brown high heeled knee high boots that night. He started rubbing my leg, unzipped them and took them off for me. At first I blushed at little because I had on these white socks with a pink heel and toe but he just smiled, took them off and chucked them aside. We've been going out for 8 months and this is the first time hes done it. Im probably being paranoid but have others experienced anything similar with their bf's?

Diffusers don't work for me, and I've tired to cut down on shampooing, and I haven't really noticed any differences.

20080927023357AAUhd6X	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Nose piercing trouble?	Okay, so i got my nose pierced like two months ago and its all healed, so i went to this shop and bought some jewellery. I got a ball closure ring and just a bar to put in and out easily. I though that my piercing was a 1.2 so i got a 1.2 nose ring and the bar. I got home and took out my nose spike corkscrew (which was quite tricky to take out) and attempted to put in the nose ring but it wasn't going in easily and as i tried to push, it went through a little, then as i tried to get it all the way through it then started to bleed a little and was a bit sore so i took it out, and afraid that my piercing was going to heal up or something i put the bar in and left it for a while. My problem is, i think the ring (1.2) was ever so slightly bigger than my original corkscrew spike (which must be 1.0), and the bar i have in now is slightly smaller than the corkscrew (which leads me to think that it must be a 0.8)!! What do i do? I think the hole has shrunk to 0.8 but i want the corkscrew back in which is 1.0, and then HOPEFULLY the ring 1.2! Should i just push the corkscrew in and see what happens or what?? Also, please don't tell me to go to my piercer because i want to know how to sort all this stuff out myself, i don't want to have to go to my piercer everytime i want to change the jewellery. Thanks

Does it give just a light coverage or can you build it up without looking like you have caked it on?   Does it go into fine lines and wrinkles?    Has anyone used the one from Avon?   Does it allow for your skin to breath and does it blend in well if you apply a moisturiser 1st or does that make it hard to apply?   Do they rub off/wear off easily during the day?

20090128153354AAEvbWC	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Why do my best friends always dump me at the last minute?	With one of them I can understand why she does it. She works from 7:30 to 4 and wakes up at 4:45, so she's always tired and she lies in on the weekend cos she's tired.      Whilst the other one goes to a grammar school now and she's always dumping me at the last minute to go to parties (where all she does is sit there and talk to people she doesn't dance, drink or anything) The thing is when she dumps me last minute it's usually the night we go to this youth club thing in her village which I have to make plans in advance to go because it starts at 7:30 and my mum doesn't get home until like 6:30 and if I go I have to leave home at 7. So usually my mum can't stay behind at work and do her planning for the next week so I loose out on spending time with her at the weekend because she has to plan for the next week. I've brought it up with my friend but she ignores it.      She's also got a boyfriend so she spends all her time with him and always bitches to me about him and he does the same thing to me. When they are around me they make me feel like a third wheel and they know it, they also kiss, etc in front of me when they know I hate it. They've got me feeling and thinking they only do it because I don't have a boyfriend so they are rubbing it in.

I have a big forehead, so some type of bangs would be good. It is naturally straight. Oh and I have a kind of big nose, it sticks out far, so something to take attention away from that would be good but I don't think there are many styles like that. I want to keep my hair long!      LINKS would be great so I can show my hairdresser.      Thanks!
20090128154042AAu7vwd	Beauty & Style;Hair	So I dyed my hair last week, a hot reddish color, now my hair is breaking off BAD. Tips please?	Yeah so, I dyed my previous times, I'd say roughly around 5 times in the year 2008. And I use permanent color at all times i do this. So I know I should stop dying it, and i am. Any tips on what I can do for my hair? I might just cut it off into a short style like the picture below.       http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc242...

20090128164346AAIHGde	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair Help? How do I use product? What are the right brands? What should I be using? Just Help Please!!!?	So I need hair help. My whole life I never used any hair products with the exceptions of shampoo and condition. My hair is alright, it's rather long and seems healthy, but I never get it cut so I do have quite a few split ends which really don't bother me so much. But my whole life I've always complained about it. There's just no volume to it whatsoever, and to me its always felt too thin and flat. So I finally decided enough was enough and started using product. I started out with a root booster that I applied while my hair was wet when I got out of the shower. I started out with a spray but soon changed to a thick sort of mouse spray which worked much better. My hair gained a much sleeker quality and did thicken up a bit at the root, however I still felt unsatisfied so I've begun to experiment with hairspray. I started flipping my hair downward in my face, brushed it out, and then sprayed it. When I flipped it back to normal. I enjoyed the look. My hair stayed large and thick but the problem is that now my hair gets knotted and looks too messy and uneven. The hairspray stiffens and crosses my hair together and everything feels just awful. It drives me crazy so I tried brushing my hair out but that made it thin and flat again, almost removing the hairspray entirely. I really don't know what to do, does anyone have any suggestions? Are their certain techniques to using hairspray? Please help, I'm very confused.      Also, if it helps, my hair is long and brown. It's straight but very wavy  and thin. I've always had trouble with it: if I wash it every day it gets dried out and feels like straw, if I don't wash it at least every other day than it gets greasy and feels heavy on my head. This is just some extra information on my hair, if it helps in answering the question.

20090128164138AAoZxQ7	Beauty & Style;Hair	Can I use my body scrub for a conditioning treatment on my hair (read details)?	I know that you can do a hair conditioning treatment with all sorts of oils like avocado oil, coconut oil, almond oil, ect. Well I have this body scrub that is pretty much just made up of these oils: coconut, sesame, almond, macadamia nut, meadowfoam seed, avocado, jojoba, sunflower and wheat germ oils. I was wondering if I could put the scrub on my hair and wrap it up in a warm towel for about a half an hour. I'm not going to scrub it into my hair or anything haha, I just want to use it for the oils. And then wash it out, and condition as usual.    Do you think it'll work?

20090128173831AAVgRml	Beauty & Style;Hair	How can I fix my hair if it was colored to dark/red?	I had my hair done today at a new salon and the girl dyed my hair what was supposed to be a light copper brown shade then added highlights. I don't like it, I think it's too dark and too red. I don't know why but the roots look more red than the ends. I used to have my hair colored like this at a different salon, but the girl who colored my hair left so I stopped having my hair colored there because nobody else did it right. The color she died my hair was a beautiful golden coppery brown not as red as this. It sucks because I even took a pictures of me a years ago when my hair was colored the way I liked to show her the color I wanted. Anyway, I'm going back tomorrow to ask her to add more highlights to lighten it up. I think highlights will make it look better but I'm still not going to love it.Anyway my question is if I still don't really like it, if I wait about 3 months for the roots to start showing and I go to another salon that I like, what are my options to get this dark color out of my hair? What can they do to get it back closer to my original shade? Is there any way other than stripping it? It's not super dark just darker and way redder than I like. I don't want to destroy my hair by stripping it. Any hairstylists out there please help me? Or anybody whose been through a similar situation please feel free to rant or give advice. Thanks for letting me whine. I really love my hair so when I get it done and don't like it I'm really a crybaby.

20090128152834AAeICs5	Beauty & Style;Hair	Help with curling hair products that does not make your hair feel coarse and look frizzy?	so i don't really have that bad of frizzy hair, it's just a little frizzy. and my hair isn't all that coarse but the gel and hair spray (freeze it hairspray: it makes my hair super curly and keeps the curl but it frizzes and makes my hair coarse and garnier fructis: curl scrunch gel: it does the same thing), they both don't give me that hard curl where you can't brush your fingers through it and it looks wet, but it's just coarse and frizzy.      ***could someone recommend any type of curling hair product (preferably people that DO NOT have naturally curly hair and it works for them) that holds a curl, doesnt make your hair crunchy, but does keep away frizz and softens and adds shine to hair, i'm tired of my hair feeling coarse. thank you so much!      PLEASE DO NOT RECOMMEND SOMETHING IF YOUR HAIR IS NATURALLY CURLY OR YOU'VE NEVER USED THE PRODUCT PERSONALLY (YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT IT FROM WHO EVER).

20090128211029AAaY0e6	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	\OMG! My mascara made my eyelashes fall off and now I'm to afraid to use mascara ever Again!! Please help!!?	I bought this new mascara, it is by loreal called volume shocking mascara. It is one of those that you put the white coating on first and then the black one. I usually put on two of the white and then two-three of the black. Well, at first little small clumps of black stuff stared falling of here and there, but I just figured they were clumps of mascara. Then, the other day after taking a shower I noticed that my eyelashes appeared to be shorter and thinner, but I wasn't sure if it was just because I am so used to seeing myself with thick, long lashes because of the mascara, or they were actually following out. Today I actually used a make creme remover and saw all these small black clumps everywhere, which I now assume are the top parts of my eyelashes. My mom said that they did look shorter. Do you think that the top part of my eyelashes fell off? Is it safe to switch to a different mascara? Will they take long to grow back? How long? Should I take a break from using mascara, and if so, how can I still get my eyes to stand out without the mascara. Please know that I often get dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep, and using eyeliner only makes me look like a raccoon. I appreciate any help or advice you can give me.
