20090131094450AADCoKC	Local Businesses;Canada;Other - Canada	I need a job desperatly. I live in Windsor, Ontario. How do I go about getting one?	So I'm a 17 year old guy going on 18 in a few months. As some of you know, Windsor really sucks for jobs right now. My mom keeps complaining to me that nobody will hire her and she goes as far as to say that I won't be able to get one. I still need to try. I've taken co-op at my school last semester so I have some work experience. My problem is that I'm a very shy and quiet person by nature so it's difficult for me to interact with people and get comfortable. I would prefer to do something more behind the scenes. If I can't find anything like that however, then I'm willing to settle for anything. Can you help me?
20090131111403AAISuL6	Local Businesses;Australia;Melbourne	What do you think about Online Auctions, Shopping and Selling.?	I have been buying and selling online but it seems the fees on feebay have chewed up a decent percentage of my sales.      I found a free listing site WWW.OZEDGE.COM with no final sale fee's and will be listing some items soon but there aren't many users.       www.ozedge.com      Apparently it is less than a week old and hasn't been indexed in any search engines yet.      They are offering $50 credit for the first 25 registrations.       What do you think about ozedge.com's potential? Is it worth listing on this site?

20090131114110AAe8iDu	Local Businesses;United States;Other - US Local Businesses	I need some ideas and suggestions to renovate my photo store?	Hello, I'm currently working in a Photo Store where we develop/print photos and sell frames. The store has been around for quite some years (10~15 years), and I'm thinking about renovating into something more modern. The store isn't exactly located in a "hip" busy area, but rather small shopping and office area. Most of our customers are business men, moms and dads, and old people. I'm thinking about renovating half of the store to try something new (the store is about 1000 sq feet). If anyone has any good idea or suggestions that might go side to side well with a photo store, it would be great and pretty fun to hear many ideas. thanks =)

I am president of the arabian club, but out club has no funding. I wanted ways to raise money, I was thinking we could have a benefit show, but I wouldn't know where to have it at. It would have to be local to mather and accessible to minors. The place would have to have room for at least twenty students to perform a dance. And, lastly i wouldn't be allowed to advertise it as a mather arabian club event, no school affiliation allowed. Our school doesn't allow raising money inside the school, at all.   HELP ME PLEASE!
