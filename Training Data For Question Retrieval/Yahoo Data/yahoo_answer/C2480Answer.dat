l9Xg8Dv4aa	John, put yourself in the place of an Editor who reads hundreds of submissions a week. <br>  Why should an Editor be interested in some one who puts a phone down,pushes his fingers through his hair and thinks,"let's just hope this doesn't reach the Papers" and nothing but wayward conversation takes place after that?<br>  How about this(?): Robin dropped the phone. It fell and smashed the  ashtray. He did not care. All he cared about  was Headlines in the Morning Paper that was spilling out in one sentence what he h had spent a fortune on legal finesse to hide......blah blah bla."<br>  This is just an idea.The rest of your story in hidden in unnecessary quotes going nowhere.<br>   Do you feel as though you have to invent dialog  this soon in the story?<br>  Take time after the headlines to tell your readers what is going on. Bring the dialog in when it is timely.<br>  Is your story a good one?  Don't know. Don't know what it is about.<br>   A suggestion here: If you are going to do this story in Glascow, You better learn what "ca canny doon the brae"means and give our characters a Scottish slant. We would enjoy that as your readers.|`|HfG7EiG1aa	Sounds good to me. My girlfriend and I both wanted to read the next bit =)|`|GyPNO47gaa	This is brilliant - no problems with grammar or anything! :)|`|sEzCw2rZaa	Its good!<br>  But a little confusing who are ellen, daisy and fiona?|`|1EbeCz4Qaa	Its really good... I love it...are u going to get it published???|`|6DMf7wrHaa	Your style is good and the use of dialogue is just right. Your opening told me the information that you added in the additional detail section. The only problem I had was why the police were suddenly in the picture and when did Robin tell them he would deal with it but that was explained in the additional detail section. Grammar and style are both good although I would have said; "Robin put the phone down" rather than "Robin put down the phone."<br>  Good luck with it and make sure you finish it.

Good figurative language.|`|e5f96ad47eff9e90b6ec54a31aca1bfcaa	L2S4 seemed rough as I read.  The rest though reads as a love poem, well penned.  My only critique would be do you need all the lines?|`|jlHz0Fg1aa	here is my advice, you have a great thing happening here already, but your poem really needs to rhyme<br>  good read otherwise, but without the rhyming, people will not know that they are reading a poem<br>  i really suggest just a simple rewrite. your concept is great<br>  try something like:<br>  <br>  A flame burns deep within<br>  A few have ever know. Hidden (see, good start)<br>  from world, yearning to flee<br>  Waiting to be seen... you see,<br>  you fan the embers into a roaring fire<br>  while i play a lovely lyre<br>  <br>  you may have to add extra lines like that and that's ok - rhyming is vital to poetry|`|WbRuTjmFaa	I have to step out of sonnet mode and relax to read this<br>  It then reads very nicely and I can see and feel the texture.<br>  I was inadvertantly inserting Iams or pent up stuff in it and it was coming out rough, once I released it to freedom it rather sang.
uCS0AUquaa	Anne McCaffrey is an excellent starting point.  I'd start with either Crystal singer or the Tower and the Hive series.   Her Dragonriders of Pern series is also a good one.<br>  <br>  side note: the series starting with Eragon written by Christopher Paolini is fantasy, not Sci-fi.<br>  <br>  The tripod trilogy by John Christopher is also a good series and is written for teenagers.  It might be hard to find, though.<br>  <br>  Or try the Robot, or Foundation series by Isaac Asimov.  They are classics.<br>  <br>  Or maybe if you can find them, The Lensman's series by E. E. Smith, also a classic.<br>  <br>  Dune by Frank Herbert is a classic and would also be an excellent first choice.|`|ZbpaRKkUaa	Are you a girl? Like Julianna says, start with John Wyndham. I would suggest The Day of the Triffids. But I gave it to my 14 year old niece and she got scared. Other books of his are The Web, The Midwich Cuckoos, Kraken Wakes. Or you could read Robin Cook's books. Coma, Brain and such other, mostly dealing with the field of medicine.|`|2hQFdy08aa	I'd go with Ender's Game because its just a great book overall.  It has a lot of science fiction elements but there's nothing WAY out there or confusing, like the technobabble in some sci-fi books.

xqgE4CrBaa	She sounds good! Try ballet twice or three times a week for this year. It will build her endurance and technique by a tenfold. After a year or two, add jazz or more ballet. You may want to reduce your ballet classes by a bit then. When it's time for kindergarten, she will have a wider variety of choices. I would also recommend a few days of ballet, and maybe some jazz, tap or modern. Good luck!|`|axHBSvFwaa	wow, she sounds good! however that is quite a lot for a two year old, you don't want her to do too much as her passion for it may fade and she may start to slack if she feels she is too good. i think she should start tap as little kids love making noise it will also help her to become very good ballet is also very good for her to do and that will help her with her gracefulness and how to move, and also Jazz she will love this and is very good if she has a lot of energy too, good luck. <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|V2v66A7Waa	Ballet. It is the start of all dances. If she is 2 maybe she could try tap?<br>  Tap is fun as she could make noise while having fun. It also builds coordination for legs and bring out her own originality. Maybe when she is 4 she could try jazz? I hope she has fun. She sound like she is very good. I hope to see her on tv one day (: at the olympics!|`|KsjUQ2Vuaa	if she moves gracefully definately ballet..gymnasts become really good ballet/pointe dancers <br>  for fun purposes jazz..jazz is really energetic and stuff<br>  at my studio there is a stretch and tricks class... you do jumps and spins and all of that fun stuff<br>  or maybe just a tech. class <br>  well i love dancing ..but it is a real commitment <br>  hope this helped|`|NNX8Qu5Taa	I would say that the best styles for her are ballet (so that she can be more graceful and work on her feet and strength) and jazz (because its faster and fun, and there is a lot of gymnastics elements in it so she would really do well). <br>  hope this helped!

In 1816, Nesselrode became Russian foreign minister, sharing influence with Count John Capodistria until the latter's retirement in 1822.  .For forty years, Nesselrode guided Russian policy and was a leading European conservative statesman of the Holy Alliance. Between 1845 and 1856, he served as Chancellor. As Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1924, he was a plenipotentiary during negotiations with the United States in defining the boundary between Russian America and the American claims known as the Oregon Country, which was resolved with the Russo-American Treaty of 1824------------------Although Russia's official delegation was led by the foreign minister, Count Karl Robert Nesselrode,( Prince Andrey Kirillovich Razumovsky, Count Gustav Ernst von Stackelberg  Tsar Alexander I was also in Vienna and regarded himself in fact as well as in name his own sole plenipotentiary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of...</a>  ----------------------------     Charles de Nesselrode, (Lisbon, Portugal, December 14, 1780 - March 23, 1862) was a Russian diplomat and a leading European conservative statesman of the Holy Alliance. His autobiography was published posthumously in 1866.<br>  <br>  He was born in Lisbon, Portugal where his father (d. 1810), a count of the Holy Roman Empire, was the ambassador of the Russian tsar. In deference to his mother's Protestantism he was baptized in the chapel of the British Embassy, thus becoming a member of the Church of England. Nesselrode's Germanic roots were emphasized by his education in a Berlin gymnasium, his father having been appointed ambassador to the Prussian court about 1787.<br>  <br>  At the age of 16 he entered the Russian Navy where, with his father's influence, he secured the position of naval aide-de-camp to Tsar Paul, (Russian: Па?вел I Петро?вич; Pavel Petrovich) (October 1 [O.S. September 20] 1754 – assasinated on March 23 [O.S. March 11] 1801), who was the Emperor of Russia between 1796 and 1801.<br>  <br>  He then moved to the army, and entered diplomatic service under Paul I's son and successor, Tsar Alexander I. He was attached to the Russian embassy at Berlin, and transferred thence to the Hague.<br>  <br>  In August 1806 Nesselrode received a commission to travel in southern Germany to report on the French troops there; he was then attached as diplomatic secretary to Generals Kamenski, Buxhoewden and Bennigsen in succession.<br>  <br>  He was present at the inconclusive Battle of Eylau in January 1807, fought by Count Von Bennigsen and assisted at the negotiations of the Peace of Tilsit, (July 1807), whereby Spanish Bonapartist Diego Fernandez de Velasco, (deceased in Paris in the exile in 1811), 13th Duke of Frías, congratulated and seated at table with Napoleon I .<br>  <br>  Nesselrode became State Secretary in 1814 and was the head of Russia's official delegation to Congress of Vienna, but for the most part Alexander I acted as his own foreign minister.

As Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1924, he was a plenipotentiary during negotiations with the United States in defining the boundary between Russian America and the American claims known as the Oregon Country, which was resolved with the Russo-American Treaty of 1824. A century later in 1924, Mount Nesselrode in the Boundary Ranges of the Alaska-British Columbia boundary was named for him.[1]<br>  <br>  In 1849 Nesselrode sent Russian troops to aid Austria in putting down the Hungarian revolution led by Lajos Kossuth.<br>  <br>  One frequently overlooked facet of his activity involved Nesselrode's attempts to penetrate Japan's self-isolation. In 1853 he dispatched Yevfimy Putyatin with a letter to the Shogun; Putyatin returned to St. Petersburg with the favorable Treaty of Shimoda.<br>  <br>  Nesselrode's efforts to expand Russia's influence in the Balkans and Mediterranean led to conflicts with Turkey, Britain, the then Kingdom of Sardinia, the then Duchy of Savoy and France, allied in the Crimean War (1853-1856). Britain and France were concerned by Russia's growing influence and were determined to support Turkey and so restrict Russia.<br>              ---------------------The Congress of Vienna was a conference of ambassadors of European states chaired by the Austrian statesman Klemens Wenzel von Metternich,|`|JLdleR96aa	The key person of the Congress of Vienna was not Russian, but rather the foreign minister of Austria, Klemens von Metternich.

That meant that humans would think it was the storm, not anything supernatural. <br>  <br>  He asked Jane to use her power on Bella. Jane's power is that she can make you think your are in a terrible pain, but you aren't really.

So they need a thunderstorm or equvalent to cover up the noise.|`|CecQFtDvaa	jane can make people think they are in pain when they are not she like manipulates their brain<br>  and they need thunder because when they hit the ball with the bat its sooooo loud but during a thunderstorm people would just think the loud noise is thunder<br>  those are my fav books in the world!!!|`|c44dIboDaa	to control bellas mind to see if she, jane, could get in to bellas mind to hurt her...make her feel pain..and they needed thunder because they make noise when they hit the baseball..they are strong and yea..lol..|`|EnEEMJmYaa	For the first question, they needed a thunderstorm cause when they play baseball they hit the ball so hard that it sounds like thunder so they needed something to cover it or it would just be a random loud noise in the day.<br>  <br>  For the second question, Jane can make you feel like your worst pain when it's not really happening and since Bella is immune to Aro's power, Aro wanted to see if she was also immune to Jane's.|`|O55yJQrCaa	in Twilight, they need a thunderstorm because when it's time to hit the ball, the strength of the hit is very powerful.

z4Yeofq8aa	The commercial relationship was pretty exploitative. Not only did Britain want colonies to provide cheap raw materials such as cotton for its manufacturing industry it wanted them  to be markets for British goods. Because British manufacturing industry during the industrial revolution was so far ahead of its competitors it had a virtual monopoly on the goods that were sold in its overseas possessions.|`|JLdleR96aa	The Industrial Revolution began in England in the textile industry.  They were very secretive about the plans of their machines, which required water power to operate.  Samuel Slater, however, had immigrated to America concealing plans in the lining of his coat.  He brought the Industrial Revolution to America, which greatly increased the demand for slaves, especially with the invention of Eli Whitney's cotton gin, which GREATLY increased the cleaning of cotton.  In the rest of Europe, Germany had become the most quickly industrializing country in the 1800s.  Canals were built in Europe for the facilitation of easy transportation of goods, and water powered industry.  This rapid industrialization greatly increased the demand for natural resources, which led to the "Scramble for Africa."

In general if an open call says it starts at 9am you should be there at 8. In this case it appears Guiding Light is doing the casting call as much for publicity as they are for looking for people for those "small" roles so my guess is they will see people for the whole time they say and it is highly unlikely they will keep people for more then a few minutes.|`|S01zIagOaa	Dude.

It doesn't matter until well after it's over, you praise praise praise your man to better his odds and keep him in the running.  <br>  <br>  The sad part is this isn't boxing, it's the people deciding how our country is going to be run.  The whole initial purpose of the "two party" system was to be able to get two points of view, and come to a sensible compromise that incorporates the good of both and minimizes the bad in each.  Whoops... now it's become that every issue must be polarized...<br>  <br>  For instance:  stimulus.  The Republicans wanted tax cuts, and minimal spending.  The Democrats agreed the tax cuts were god, but wanted more spending.  So WHY THE HELL wasn't there a stimulus bill with just tax cuts tthat both agreed on, and a spending bill LATER????  It's become a political jockey back and forth game.  It's ridiculous.|`|tsjLHXzUaa	Its called "being loyal to your country and to your elected leaders, respecting your democratic process by respecting those who were democratically elected".<br>  <br>  Just because I didnt vote for Obama doesnt mean Im going to be anti-American and a disloyalist. You cannot complain about the results of democracy without complaining about the mechanism of democracy.  Turning back the clocks on societies choice and "correcting" their mistake to what *you want* is called dictatorship.<br>  <br>  If you dont like it, move to China.  Their democracy is probably more to your liking... but only if youre the one calling the shots, right?<br>  <br>  Those who would complain about the results of an election when it doesnt go their way, but celebrate when it does... are hypocrites.  You should celebrate that your candidate even stood a chance, that you had the opportunity to cast a vote.<br>  <br>  Sure... you have every right to complain, to voice your opinion.  So do I.  But at what cost?  When whiners undermine the very democracy that gave them the right to whine... we are in trouble.|`|VLP5l3J0aa	Those that support Obama follow their leader blindly and without question that he will somehow do what he says he will do.

This will light up the face at the end of the movement.  If you have a remote release, do this on delay you can use yourself as the model.<br>  I would say best done digitally as you can check your shutter speed & exposure as you shoot and have the EXIF data to analyse afterwards.  If you're going for film you'd have to shoot a roll at different settings, noting setting for each frame manually, & once developed see which shots gave the best effect.<br>  ISO - depends again on what effect you are trying to achieve - do you want a grainy/noisy image for 'grunge' effect? If not, then I would personally go for a low ISO to get best image quality.|`|dwPxU89Vaa	With such a lower shutter speed you need very low light, if you want a very similar photo, beyond the effect itself, look how the light comes frome the left only, that gives more dramatic composition, doesnt matter if the camera has film or is digital, the procedure is the same, if you mean you pretend to make something similar on your pc, you can take 2 pics, put'em on two diferent layers and give the upper layer only 50% opacity, it will be not the same, but you can play with it.|`|VkKS8nQuaa	3 second exposure, low light.<br>  <br>  Simple. start facing the camera then turn changing expression.<br>  <br>  You're going to need to change apertures a couple of times to get the proper exposure you want but it's easy to do.|`|CcXIbqnOaa	looks like double exposure to me.<br>  if your film doesn't automatically advance just snap two shots on a single frame.|`|nEQ7KrVuaa	you need to use a long exposure and the model must move/change expression during this exposure. make sure to put your camera on a tripod though otherwise it is impossible to hold it still enough during the long exposure<br>  <br>  a long exposure is also the technique lots of photographers use to create trails of light you see in many photos|`|nTDCGwmvaa	use picnik.com|`|j5Apt8hWaa	It only has to do with putting your camera on a tripod and then directing your model to move their head during the exposure.

8QKgkOZfaa	Technology has really distracted the teenagers of today from reading and has deprived them of a healthy amount of it.<br>  <br>  No, I don't, but I also think that there is a growing love for stories as there are more books published on abstract ideas that appeal to people who, in the past, have never had a genre to appeal to them. For example: Three boys in my history class are anti-readers. When a book was recommended to them, and I hadn't ever heard of a book quite like it (it was some sort of dark, sci-fi book about a skate-boarder or something..). I also think the technology age is having its reverse effects as well.

I went on a walk to Gordale Scar in Yorkshire with some friends. This offering is the outcome:-<br>  <br>  <br>  We spread our wings and flew the nest,<br>  In Yorkshire's 'Dales' we came to rest.<br>  No longer young but game to play,<br>  three friends a creaking walked the way.<br>  <br>  Our pace was slowed by a medical anomaly,<br>  the handsome, fair chap writing this little homily.<br>  But Sir Wil' the Courteous at each little rest,<br>  took a chance at death by trying to jest.<br>  <br>  "Dangerman," said he-addressing me,<br>  you're holding us up, we'll be late for our tea.<br>  If you don't move faster, you'll find I'm the master,<br>  For my camera records each undignified slip.<br>  But disaster struck the master as he strode ever<br>  faster, he suddenly halted<br>  pain curling his lip.<br>  Our leader stuck down, only just out of town<br>  with feet throbbing, tormenting and giving him 'Gyp.'<br>  <br>  Sir Wil' was down but help was at hand,<br>  for Sir Roger had training in healing the 'creaky<br>  Brigand.'<br>  His forte was feet, although training not<br>  complete,<br>  gave advice aiding healing of  Sir Wil's 'plates of<br>  meat.'<br>  <br>  Onward we rambled in countryside still,<br>  Colin grimacing and shocked by fair Sir Roger's bill.<br>  For he charged Wil' twenty guineas,<br>  curses, what a bitter pill.<br>  <br>  "He'll have me in debtor's court;<br>  What a scoundrel, what a rogue.<br>  We all know charging guineas<br>  was yesteryear's vogue."<br>  <br>  We ambled sedately in countryside fair.<br>  Lady Carole providing our sustenance there.<br>  She made delightful provisions so tasty and sweet,<br>  that after our hike we felt most replete.<br>  <br>  She carried our water,<br>  held open each gate.<br>  Such a kind, thoughtful lady,<br>  made our day such a memorable date.<br>  <br>  Janet's Foss, our first glimpse<br>  of nature's fine gift.<br>  The rock strewn landscape, our spirits did lift.<br>  The water cascading down with its life giving flow,<br>  onto moss laden boulders a short drop below.<br>  <br>  <br>  We all took our time to rest and gaze at the scene.<br>  Kindly Roger cupping hand in brook,<br>  to wipe his brow clean.<br>  For the walk did cause our faces to glow,<br>  the water cooling, scooped from the sweet passing<br>  flow.<br>  <br>  The three "SAS hopeful's" rounding a bend.<br>  Such a sight to behold, watching climbers ascend.<br>  The awesome, towering cliffs, seeming to surround,<br>  and inviting the adventurers, so many did abound.<br>  This titanic remnant of glacial flows of old;<br>  This heart stopping moment that we so longed to<br>  behold.<br>  <br>  The winding path we slowly ascended,<br>  Colin capturing moments that too soon were ended.<br>  His photographic skills securing moments sublime<br>  as we strode weakly upward on a gentle incline.<br>  <br>  Solitude amidst friends, private thoughts of awe.<br>  In such wild and rugged landscape, created without<br>  flaw.<br>  Each moment seemed extended, the grass green slopes<br>  aglow.<br>  With limestone pavement peeping through,<br>  our eyes on the sweeping valley below.<br>  <br>  And so the weary trio did walk homeward,<br>  Feet heavy but with hearts filled anew.<br>  "Gordale Scar" that we so long had dreamed of,<br>  a glorious memory shared by so few.|`|MhYFGewDaa	Something different<br>  NOT about love or life or death, be original

iNXqiDIYaa	their behaviour would have been considered outrageous at the time the story was written<br>  <br>  Analysis<br>  The Storm is a story of sexuality and real life. Chopin wrote of something that was not publicly discussed. The relationship between Calixta and Alcée brought out a spark of passion that was not present in their marriages. Calixta was scared of the storm but Alcée's calmness relaxed her physically. Emotionally it brought out her sexuality that was kept dormant from her younger years. When Alcée embraced her after lightning and thunder hit, it reminded her of the passion and love she once had for Alcée. It was as though her sexuality was driven by nature. The storm was brewing outside and leaving destruction in its path, like the bruise she put on her marriage by having the affair with Alcée.<br>  <br>  The narrator describes Calixta as a worry-some wife but then it transforms into a description of her youthful beauty. The focus is on her vivacious body after Alcée not seeing her for five years and becomes entranced in it. Calixta's husband seemed not to look at her the same way Alcée did. He saw her as a real woman but she pretended that everything has changes especially after having a child. When the narrator said "The rain was over and the sun was turning the glistening green world into a palace of gems," it symbolized that they both had new outlooks on their marriages. Calixta was able to take her affair and use it to her advantage by helping her remember what a sexual person she once was. This metaphor could also mean, since the rain was the passion they had, and the world was their perception of both their marriages (All the blinds closed ie not thinking about their marraiges), and the palace of gems is how beautiful their marriages looked afterward, then their marraiges won't have that beauty with time, because like the world after a rain when the sun is shining, it only glistens until the rain dries up. The story ending with the quote "So the storm passed and every one was happy" symbolizes that Calixta and Alcée were happy to have the affair since it helped their marriages and both spouses would know nothing of the affair. The point of view is 3rd person omniscient.

When I started reading it, it was really confusing and not very exiting. It doesn't have the same charm as twilight, that is for sure. Still, Meyers is an excellent author- I just think that she needs to stick to twilight for now. If you do like confusing beginnings, then read the host. As for me, my head ached the moment I tried to understand the confusing plot at the beginning. So much, in fact, that I gave up on it.|`|kvog6ICCaa	I really liked The Host, although it's a lot more science fiction than the Twilight saga.

(:|`|ewd9n2lRaa	I read The Host and it was an okay book, wasn't horrible but I don't think it was all that great either.  I read it after the Twilight books and was hoping it would have the same charm as the first Twilight book but it didn't for me.  The beginning is very slow, I didn't really get interested in reading it until about 100 pages in and then it went in spurts.|`|gUp9lLIxaa	My friends have and there begging me to read it so we can talk about it.

My thoughts and prayers are sent to you and your loved ones.<br>  <br>  Here's a poem, which is light and positive way to say good bye:<br>  <br>  <br>  Goodbye! <br>  <br>  Come, thrust your hands in the warm earth <br>  And feel her strength through all your veins; <br>  Breathe her full odours, taste her mouth, <br>  Which laughs away imagined pains; <br>  Touch her life's womb, yet know <br>  This substance makes your grave also.<br>  <br>  Shrink not; your flesh is no more sweet <br>  Than flowers which daily blow and die; <br>  Nor are your mein and dress so neat, <br>  Nor half so pure your lucid eye; <br>  And, yet, by flowers and earth I swear <br>  You're neat and pure and sweet and fair. <br>  <br>  --by Richard Aldington|`|fnXN6cKSaa	I'll go home from here mom, and you won't be there<br>  I'll walk round the house and you won't be anywhere<br>  But my memories of you will be with me forever<br>  I will only forget you on the 12th of Never<br>  <br>  This is the best I could do right now.  May peace return to your life soon.

Are stances seem to opposed to be proper and fair to the other. Still, I won't deny the talent inherit in your work. Want a critique, all I have is that you misspelled "vegetables" in the third stanza, third line. To be fair, I wish I could properly critique poetry that is alien if form to my own.

You might look into that--it was a pretty intense read. I think Frank Perretti has some like that as well.

0vfX40Qxaa	Ibanez makes some great guitars at a good price, and many have built in tuners, but the best advice is to shop around, and play as many different guitars as you can find in your price range,  there are many good makes, and models of guitars out there, and they all play and sound a little different.  Try them out with and without an amp, find the one that plays, feels and sounds the best for you. <br>  If you find one that doesn't have a built in tuner look into the clip on styles,  they clip on to the headstock, and use the guitars vibrations to tune.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	how bout this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Jasmine-by-Takamine-ES450C-Quilttop-AcousticElectric-Guitar?sku=520095" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...</a><br>  <br>  on your edit: talmans are pretty decent I owned one for a while.|`|pnyoaSPVaa	>>...preferably with a built in tuner or a good retainer...<<<br>  <br>  I know what a tuner is but what's a retainer?

z4Yeofq8aa	Primary textual evidence for that won't be easy to find but it can safely be assumed that only the social elite and clergy would have been literate. Education was expensive and not therefore available to most of society. Your best bet is to get a book on the period by a reputable historian and see what sources he cites as evidence.|`|VXcnq3zGaa	There will be no data of that sort available.

vhlORK4Waa	As the first poster rightly says, No, as they are different people - potted bios below for your information!<br>  <br>  Henry was born in the Royal Chateau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, the son of Francis I and Claude de France (daughter of Louis XII of France and Anne, Duchess of Brittany). With his brother, he spent three years in Spain as a hostage to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, as surety for his father, who had been captured at the Battle of Pavia. Henry married Catherine de' Medici (13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589) on 28 October 1533, when both were fourteen years old.<br>  <br>  The following year he became involved with the thirty-five-year-old, recently widowed, Diane de Poitiers, who became his most trusted confidante and for the next twenty-five years wielded considerable influence behind the scenes, even signing royal documents. Extremely confident, mature and intelligent, she left Catherine powerless to intervene.<br>  <br>  When his older brother Francis died in 1536 after a game of tennis, Henry became heir to the throne; he succeeded his father on his 28th birthday, 31 March 1547 and was crowned King of France on 25 July 1547 at Reims.<br>  <br>  <br>  Henry VI (1421 - 1471) <br>  <br>  <br>  Henry VIKing from 1422 to 1461 and from 1470 to 1471 and the last Lancastrian ruler of England, Henry's reign was dominated by the Wars of the Roses.<br>  <br>  Henry was born on 6 December 1421 at Windsor Castle. He was only nine months old when he succeeded his father, Henry V. He was crowned king of England in 1429 and, as result of his father's successes against the French, king of France in 1431. A regency council ran England until Henry was considered old enough to rule in 1437. In 1445, he married Margaret of Anjou.<br>  <br>  Henry was a pious man whose interest in government was sporadic, who picked the wrong advisors and who was unable to prevent the power struggles that began to develop at court. Meanwhile, the dual monarchy proved too difficult to maintain; the successes of the Dauphin and Joan of Arc began to weaken England's grip on its French possessions and Normandy was lost in 1450. This only contributed to the erosion of Henry's prestige and authority.<br>  <br>  In 1453 the King had a mental breakdown and Richard, Duke of York, was made Protector. The King recovered in 1455, but civil war broke out between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions. The ensuing struggle came to be known as the Wars of the Roses. While the Duke of York was the main figure on the Yorkist side; Margaret, Henry's queen, took charge of the Lancastrian cause. In 1460, York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield but his son took up the fight, defeating the Lancastrians at Towton in 1461 and crowning himself King Edward IV. Henry fled into exile, but returned and was captured by Edward in 1465. The Earl of Warwick - previously an ally of Edward - now switched sides and restored Henry to the throne in 1470. Edward returned from exile and destroyed the Lancastrian forces at Tewkesbury in May 1471. Henry and Margaret's only son was among the Lancastrian dead. Henry, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London, was murdered shortly afterwards.<br>   <br>  So not only different people, but different periods in history too.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Halcon :-))|`|WJjkq7lTaa	<a href="http://www.britroyals.com/kings.asp?id=henry6" rel="nofollow">http://www.britroyals.com/kings.asp?id=h...</a><br>  <br>  You rarely find him referred to as Henri II as Charles VII was crowned marginally before him and despite Henry's claim being superior de jure, Charles VII was the better able to enforce his claim in practice. As a result Henri doesn't generally get in the listings of French kings so a latter French king uses that title leading to some confusion...|`|lvR2eCWQaa	NOOOOO|`|4E5HqfE0aa	wwwfrance

Wn0nwNFjaa	I believe in the UK we lowered the age of majority in 1970 from 21 to 18 to increase the votes to the Labour Party, as they youth are generally more left wing in their politics.|`|AA12182122	~I presume you are referring to the right to vote (which has nothing whatsoever to do with the age of majority) and Amendment XXVI, ratified in 1971.  That amendment came about as one of the changes resulting from the civil/social unrest of the 60s and the momentum behind it was driven by the Vietnam War and a host of other issues, including the Women's Movement and the Civil Rights Movement.  It took all of two months for the requisite 38 states to ratify the amendment, the fastest ratification of an amendment in US Constitutional history.<br>  <br>  Too bad today's teeny-boppers don't exercise the right.  In the 72 elections, 55% of 18 to 24 year olds voted.  In 2002, 19% of them voted.  Ever since 1972, the percentage of people in the 18-24 who exercise the group has declined, with a few exceptions.  However, the voters who gained the franchise by Amendment XXVI remain among the largest block of voters.  I guess those of us who fought for it really wanted it, and those we passed it down to don't know enough to use it and don't appreciate what we did for them.  <br>  <br>  As a practical matter, the amendment was proposed in part to clean up the mess caused by Oregon v Mitchell, wherein the Supreme Court held, in 1970,  that while Congress could establish a voting age for federal elections, it could not set the voting age for state elections.  Thus, it would have been possible for a state, like Oregon, to set the voting age at 21 even though the federal age was 18.  Two sets of ballots would have been necessary in such instance, with one for 21 year olds including both state and federal matters, and one for 18 year olds, including only the federal issues.  Amendment XXVI required all states to set the voting age at 21, regardless of the age of majority.<br>  <br>  The right to vote is not the same thing as the age of majority.  The age of majority is an issue reserved exclusively to state law.  Over the years, most states have set the age of majority at eighteen, but in  Alabama and Nebraska, it is 19 and in Mississippi it is 21.  (Well, Mississippi raises some confusion.  One law defines "an adult"  as one who has attained the age of 21 years, while another statute sets 18 as the age of majority.)   In New York, the age of majority is 18, but parents are liable for child support until age 21 (with statutory exceptions that can terminate the obligation at a lower age).  Emancipation of a minor is also a matter separate and distinct from the age of majority.  An emancipated minor is not vested with adult status.<br>  <br>  The age of majority is the legally defined age at which a person is considered an adult, with all the attendant rights and responsibilities of adulthood. The age of majority is defined by state laws, which vary by state, but is 18 in most states. Rights acquired upon reaching the age of majority include the rights to vote (which right, as has been demonstrated, can vest prior to the age of majority) and consent to marriage, among others. However, the right to vote is 18 nationwide under the 26th Amendment to the Constitution, regardless of the state laws.  The "age of license" is the age at which certain rights, such as the right to vote, can be exercised.<br>  <br>  The right to purchase alcoholic beverages is also a matter strictly within the purview of state law.  However, most (all?) states have raised the drinking age to 21, regardless of the age the age of majority (another example of age of majority vs age of license) because the federal government threatened to cut federal highway money to all states who did not set the age at 21.<br>  <br>  Edit:  The UK?  Oh, never mind.  But unless I'm mistaken, the age of majority in Scotland is 16, even though the right to vote there does not vest until age 18.  The age of license/age of majority analysis is apropos of the UK just as it is of the US.|`|N86vHKxtaa	In response to civil unrest related to the Vietnam War and the draft, the age of majority was lowered from 21 to 18 to permit potential draftees to vote.|`|AA11942204	There was some sympathy, in the Vietnam era, for the principle that if you are old enough to fight you are old enough to vote.|`|ANzszvWRaa	In the UK and in strictly legal terms, there has never been a universal "age of majority" applying to all situations.<br>  <br>  The legal ages at which you can vote, get married, buy alcohol, inherit a fortune, drive a motorbike or car, purchase explosives (such as black powder), join the Armed forces, own a shotgun or firearm, watch certain films, own a house or have sex (legally) are all covered by different legislation and the ages specified for each are different.<br>  <br>  This lack of an overall age of majority is an important feature of British Law, as compared with law in other countries and it has its roots in Anglo-Norman law.<br>  <br>  Quote from the Electoral Commission:<br>  "In the UK, there is no standard legal ‘age of majority’, with different minimum ages<br>  applying in relation to different activities.

E66Newupaa	Becoming a comedian is a process. As a comedian and writer myself I can give you some tips. I started out knowing I was funny. Friends laughed at the stuff I did and I was always saying funny stuff about commercials and songs, etc.<br>  <br>  Start out by listening to all the comedians you possibly can. You will find that the ones that make you laugh the most are probably doing comedy in a style that would suit you.<br>  <br>  Read any books you can get your hands on about joke writing. Take some workshops.  Here's a good one: <br>  <a href="http://www.standupcomedyclinic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.standupcomedyclinic.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Carry a notebook or a voice recorder with you wherever you go and any time you say something funny write it down. But don't stop there. Set aside an hour a day (or more) to force yourself to try to write jokes about the news, commercials etc. <br>  <br>  One of the best ways to start with this is using a technique I call "Just the Facts" I take a quote or a line someone just said on the news, commercial, web and I try to tag it...for example:<br>  <br>  "I just saw a commercial...It said "Nyquil. Now with Vitamin C." That's dumb! Drugs with Vitamin C. What's next? "Marijuana. Now with Ginko."<br>  <br>  There are tons of exercises you can do by taking quotes and changing the endings to be funny. <br>  <br>  Then, once you have say, 10-mins of material that you have tried on your friends...get to a local comedy club or call the nearest club and ask them if they have an open-mic or a another way you can showcase or try-out. If you find that your stuff is getting laughs from a real audience, then keep going back to that club, or other clubs, meet the other comedians. <br>  <br>  Video tape your act. Get used to watching yourself and listening to yourself. At first it seems strange, but you will get used to it. Use the tape to find your strengths and weaknesses. Try to improve.<br>  <br>  If you have a fifteen minute set you can possibly start to get some opening slots.<br>  <br>  From there if you continue to work hard and write, write, write...then your reputation will help you on your journey.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions you can visit my website or drop me an email at jc@standupcomedyclinic.com.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	You're half way there... you are already just about the biggest JOKE I've seen on answers today.|`|UsTyc0oeaa	First, look for books on how to perform comedy, stand-up comedy, and physical comedy. Even if it's not exactly the kind or style that you want to perform, the principles will be similar. One very good book is "How To Be Really Funny" by Mark Stolzenberg. (No, I'm not him.)<br>  <br>  Almost all comedy clubs have what is called an "Open Mic Night" which literally means that they open up the microphone for anyone who wants to stand up in front of the crowd and try their material.<br>  <br>  In addition to comedy clubs, some bars, coffee houses, and Karaoke clubs do this as well.<br>  <br>  A good way to prepare yourself for speaking in public would be to seek out and join a local chapter of "Toastmasters". Not the kind that toast bread, but the group that helps you hone your speaking skills.<br>  <br>  Consider other forms of comedy entertainment, too. Steve Martin got his start performing magic and selling magic tricks at amusement parks. Robin Williams dropped out of the acting department at Julliard to become a street performer in San Francisco. Martin Mull wrote comedy songs and played guitar at comedy clubs, and performed an act with Steve Martin for awhile, too. Penn Jillette went to Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Clown College.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of ways, and many various skills, that you can use to get started in a career in comedy.<br>  <br>  Be warned: The stand-up comedy business is VERY tough and competitive. And while you are on "the circuit" paying your dues on the road, it does NOT pay well. Some club owners try to get out of paying the amounts they said they would. Some stand-up comics (the ones who believe they are superstars who just haven't gotten their "big break" yet) are bitter and cynical, and resort to back-stabbing and bad-mouthing. Not all are like that, but some are, and even a few bad experiences like that can temp you to become that way yourself.<br>  <br>  You should develop a thick skin and an "I can rise above all this" attitude, and be prepared to take a lot of poor treatment by other comics, comedy club owners, and especially from drunk audiences. The business is not for people who get their feelings hurt easily.<br>  <br>  I wish you much success, but it will be a tough road. I hope you make it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2404nDvSaa	go to a club, humor place, etc. somewhere with a free standup night put your name on the list. if people like you, you'll get farther in the buisness...

African tribes don't have currency and they do not have the cultural or technological benefits of 1st world countries. I am not saying that people in civilizations are inherently cruel to people who are poor and homeless, its that these people aren't compatible with civilization and they are doomed to suffer its wrath. No home, no food, no happiness, everything is bought with money.<br>  <br>  It would be idyllic to think that civilizations are build around the basis that people must work within civilization to get anything out of it, that at least is the general principal. However companies are always trying to pay the least amount to its workers, attempting to gain as much surplus value as possible. In some ways people are enslaved by there job lest they become homeless. Also some blame has to be apportioned to the parents of homeless people. Did they raise there child properly to be ready for society? Did they turf them out of the house when they were 16? like there parents before them? <br>  <br>  Two things need to change to get rid of cruelty from money.

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her|`|wLOXyEVGaa	I read all those books at one point or the other.

rsg0zBT6aa	YESSIR MY FAVORITE AUTHUR IS Charles Dickens.<br>  I like Dickens because of his attention to detail.  His characters are so well thought out and developed, that you actually feel like they're someone you know.  Even the villains are extremely well done.  When one of the 'bad guys' does something bad to a character you like, you actually start to feel anger towards them.<br>  His settings are also full of superb details.  Besides that, his humor is great.  Sometimes he makes you laugh out loud.<br>  Also, his stories themselves are excellent.  So imaginative and creative, with such plot twists that you never know what's going to happen next.<br>  <br>  I could go on for a long time, but I won't.

fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	Technically you do not even need a degree to start your own class. HOWEVER, it benefits you in many ways. One you earn credibility by having a degree, you learn important skills in both classroom management as well as class content, and as running a drama class only pays so much your degree will help your earning potential overall.  <br>  <br>  The teaching certificate comes in when you are hoping to teach in public schools. More and more private schools prefer it as well but if you are running your own then you do not need a teaching certificate unless you hope to run the class within a public school doing outreach with them. <br>  <br>  Ultimately if your goal was to run a drama school and not just a class then you would benefit as much taking business classes as you would teachers training.|`|EzcQOTPtaa	You can always open your own school. However, that requires saving money. A teaching degree will allow you to teach acting at a public or private school. That is a solid way to save some money and build up a reputation.|`|PW2enzldaa	I'm pretty sure you would be able to start up your own drama class purely with the degree, unless you actually want to be a qualified drama teacher.<br>  <br>   If there is a requirement for teacher training, you could just take a PGCE (postgraduate certificate in education) after your degree, which only takes a year I believe, and would give you plentiful knowledge on the subject of teaching, which I imagine is a good thing to have whether you need it to start your class or not.<br>  <br>  Hope that's some help! Take care :)

wlaxCA3Iaa	I am entertained by both Harry Potter and Twilight. However I feel Harry Potter has a better story line and plot than Twilight. Harry Potter is a timeless classic that almost everyone can relate to and enjoy. Twilight on the other hand is not, it is a fantasy romance novel directed towards teenage girls and will not stand the test of time.<br>  <br>  Read Harry Potter|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You should read a lot more than "a" book. You should read lots of books.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter is a genuinely well-written series - but start with the first one, not the fifth. Don't bother with Twilight.|`|86oPkfzOaa	Read both. They're both good.|`|zy5qcc0Raa	well, if you're on the 6th harry potter book, and have read the other 5, then i would read the harry potter and the half blood prince, then the 7th one, harry potter and the deathly hallows, and then i would start the twilight series! they're amazing! i love both series and that's a really tought choice, but i would finish one series before you start another.|`|NBOBMQwdaa	If you've already read the rest of the Harry Potter series, I would recommend reading the Half Blood Prince. It's a really good book.<br>  <br>  If you want something new, read Twilight. Also a very good book.<br>  <br>  I'd say you should read both eventually as they are both definitely worth reading.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Harry Potter, though I would start with the first in the series if you haven't read the ones before Half Blood Prince already. It will make more sense that way. <br>   Twilight is ridiculous and honestly shouldn't have even been published.|`|ec35c45458d391650124caccb1cab120aa	Twilight. I really didn't like the 6th or 7th Harry Potter's. But you should probably read both. They both are key books in modern teen culture/|`|p6jHHYzGaa	twilight sista|`|TU7vDI95aa	Only read the Half-Blood Prince if you've read the first five Harry Potter books.  You absolutely should read all of the books in order.  It's an incredibly well-done series.  The writing is strong, the characters have many dimensions, and the plots are incredibly intricate.  She'll leave you a clue in book two that hints at something in book seven.  It's amazing.  The books combine fantasy, adventure, coming-of-age themes, romance, and humor, and the series is essentially an allegory for WWII.  <br>  <br>  Twilight is poorly written, the characters are one-dimensional, the plots go nowhere, and the books send a message that a girl should sacrifice everything for one guy.

Not blooded. :)|`|UQaMXkBFaa	personally i liked twilight better, but honestly harry potter is a better well written novel. but the story line in twiight it better.|`|OhSCAE0faa	HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.twilight is the stupidest book ever written.plzz don't read that.don't waste your time reading it.<br>  <br>  harry potter is great!!!!!!|`|aBh7uZkuaa	I really don't care if any of you guys give me a thumbs down but : HARRY POTTER!!!!! is way better.<br>  It has a better storyline.|`|39wcLSoPaa	well almost every girl in my school is reading twilight and so far every single one says it is their fav. book now or it is really good.|`|nmEvLJwxaa	Definitely twilight, i'm reading the 1st one right now!!

Harry Potter seems to change and get boring around the fifth one, but Twilight stays the same though out the series so far.|`|yqa2sWY7aa	bothhh :) twilight is a REALLY fast readdd|`|KRkPYm6Maa	Both|`|C0RXM3kHaa	Even twilight seems a bit interesting
p0AUrLgwaa	Agreed. The author(s) of this attempt at obvious obfuscation are basically chasing their tale. It literally doesn't really mean anything. Interpersonal communications, or speaking to one another in a manner easily understandable and actually communicating an idea or knowledge is what teachers do.  I mean "Classroom Communities of Speech and Emancipatory Pedagogy and Praxis" WTF??? Was this written by,  attorneys? Congress? Class room communities of speech is almost oxymoronic.  It's a load of crap and seems to be something to confuse teachers and administrators and could probably be used to control teachers and their lesson plans and subject matter.|`|kTNz1VJuaa	I can certainly see why you're concerned. I think it reads like a syllabus for a course in an Education degree plan, in effect, a course for students who are trying to become teachers.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it was written by one of those B.S. artists who dominate sales offices, public relations firms and government. Maybe it's part of that whole "No Child Left Behind" cult.

zN6CJ3tzaa	These are just a few things that I do to help my creative juices flowing and to see just how creative I can be:<br>  <br>  Drawing an image upside down. Believe it or not, drawing an upside down image helps your brain differentiate between what your brain knows and what your eye truly sees. Instead of merely drawing what you know, you're drawing what is actually in the image.<br>  <br>  Drawing something ordinary, but giving it a fanciful twist. Like a royal family portrait (from the 1700's), but they're all cats or different breeds of dogs.<br>  <br>  Create your own tarot designs. Certain symbols of the tarot deck can be made even more fantastic or even "cute". They will mean the same thing, but you will have put your own spin on them.<br>  <br>  Toying with texture. Do an illustration with a medium you're comfortable with, then add texture with paint or illuminate it with gold, bronze, or silver. You'd be amazed how you can make something POP with just the added texture or metallic embellishment. Or age some heavy vellum and create your own archival artwork. Tint the paper with tea or coffee grounds. Once you've tinted/aged your paper, allow it drying time, then create your own Gutenberg'esque piece.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of what I mean: <a href="http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/exhibits/treasures/horae.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/exhibit...</a><br>  <br>  Just relax and do something fun. Don't worry about impressing anyone. No pressure -- just creating for the sake of creating.|`|oGdUIrwBaa	you could also try drawing cartoons of your family members or portraits of them real-life. Something that is really fun and fast is having an ink pen and using it to draw buildings or animals as fast as you can. This helps to practise your drawing skills and not only that, your eye memory as well. I have tried to draw animals while they are moving and it really gives you the practise to draw faster.|`|AA12339318	Whatever your dominant hand is, try doing some quick sketches with your OTHER hand.  If you are right-handed, try your left, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Don't expect the result to be easy, or even good.  But, it can be VERY interesting.  This exercise forces you to use a different part of your brain.  Even if you become pretty good at this "opposite" hand drawing, you will find that it produces a very different style of drawing, almost as if it were done be a different person.<br>  <br>  It's lots of fun and is a good way to improve your skill set.
YpcyrLQuaa	Easy :) Description. <br>  <br>  <br>  As Rylee and Aunt Marla walk inside, describe the house. Is her living room tidy? Is it fancy? Is it cluttered or filled with different trinkets? Does she have potted plants everywhere or cats lounging on the window seat?<br>  <br>  <br>  This can tell whoever it is reading your story what kind of person Aunt Marla is.<br>  <br>  <br>  EXAMPLE: If her living room is fancy, Aunt Marla can be the wife of a important business man who is always away on business trips. This can make her feel a bit lonely. EXAMPLE: If her living room is cluttered and filled with little trinkets, Aunt Marla could be unorganized and carefree. She has too much to do and too many friends to chit chat with too stay home and clean. EXAMPLE: If she has potted plants everywhere, Aunt Marla could be a devoted gardener. I think gardeners are kind and learn patience from their plants. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your writing :)|`|pxrOzEcKaa	write about what yall did in the house and how miserable she made you|`|iHS7n01Xaa	We followed them ito the living room, which was well furnished and clean. the room was dotted with pink wallpaper, curiously suggestive water paintings, and blue furniture. 2 men were sat on the sofa, looking at me intently. I instantly recognised them as Richard Nixon and 50 Cent. <br>  I ducked just in time as a hail of golden bullets arced through the air towards me. I looked up to see Fiddy reloading his pimped up machine gun, and Richard Nixon readying a baseball bat and samurai sword. I took off my diamond studded tiara and flung it at the rapper. The headband curved like a boomerang and smashed his precious rifle into pieces. Nixon charged at me with his baseball bat, having passed the sword to the weaponless 50 Cent. I dodged a blow from the ex-US President and slammed my fist into his rib. He staggered, giving me a short time to steady myself before the cocaine-addled 50 Cent charged at me in turn. I grabbed a painting frame from the wall and smashed it down onto his bald head, the glass shattering and the painting paper tearing. Unconscious, Fiddy slumped to the floor like a pupper with his strings cut. I tore my eyes away to see Richard Nixon charging at me again. I readied myself for another blow, but was shocked to see another figure come crashing through the window and colliding with Nixon. A familiar face looked up at me and I smiled. <br>  "Hello, Harry. It's a shame you couldn't turn up sooner". <br>  Potter stood up and brushed his Black fringe away, revealing his lightning bolt scar. <br>  "Sorry. That b@stard Akon had to give me some new equipment".|`|dXO38kXAaa	We followed her down a dark hall, stumbled<br>  a couple times.

vWIouzK3aa	It's so much easier to listen to the propaganda and let yourself be programmed, don't you think? The majority of people just can't think for themselves and are easily manipulated with the propaganda that is constantly put into the main stream. Then the ignorant people believe they'll appear smart if they just don't believe conspiracies are plausible. It's the easy way to go.

Any time one opens up an investigation unknown facts and fiction is revealed. Also there is no need to investigate unless their is due process to prosecute. There are many things I have questions about as do others that I am sure will not be answered. As an example is the JFK assassination. It does not matter how many people have investigated it and what conclusions people claim there is no agreement. The official rendering is Oswald acted alone. There are many happenings about 9/11 that are questionable. The one that has intrigued me while I was watching on TV is how the collapse of the twin towers could have happened the way it unfolded.  It is impossible for the towers to collapse in the manner they did. It defies the law of physics.|`|rNmekxLcaa	September 11 is the 254th day of the year (255th in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar. There are 111 days remaining until the end of the year.

BTkUHEdzaa	“Christmas Time on the Frontier” was about another family who was very poor. The husband was a pastor and wasn’t getting paid much at all. They were never able to get new clothes and they almost weren’t going to get anything for Christmas. But like God has shown over and over the husband and wife had a change of heart and they knew that even though they weren’t going to be able to get there children everything they wanted, it would still be okay. Just then God supplied all there needs and they found everything the children wanted: two pairs of skates for the boys and a wax doll for the girl. Both these stories are very similar, these are just two great examples of how great God is!|`|x1LmS9vTaa	Here's the story.

MXMMlSJPaa	money is the root of all evil|`|LMZQK8EUaa	Money is purely a symbol of motivation created by the changing perceptions of time in society. As society developed from hunters/gatherers, we became more dependent on each individual's actions to support the community as a whole. Because early society depended on EVERY single member, and the reward of your own work could only be realized with the help of others, a universal reward was set.<br>  <br>  This is an example that is in the perspective of a very simple society:<br>  1.) Several men trained to hunt go hunting and kill a buffalo and then bring it back to their town.<br>  2.) Several others with honed skills of skinning and using every piece of the animal process the carcass.<br>  3.) The bones are then shaped and made into tools by other people with those skills.<br>  4.) Merchants of that town with a specific set of skills in trading then trade some of those tools with other towns and bring back certain things that their environment does not supply on its own.<br>  <br>              As you can see, every single person has a role but every single person needs to be rewarded for said role. Because each person can't take their own individual byproduct and utilize as well as some others, the entire community helps out and is rewarded in the end with exotic goods from other towns. <br>              As time gradually progressed, this trade developed globally and then came money. Let's say that you had several bone tools made out of a certain animal that was very rare and you did not need them. Now there was a merchant that had a bushel of wheat that you didn't need either, but that merchant needs those tools made of bone. Because of this problem, society made a universal economic language that all people speak- money. That merchant could pay you some money to get the tools and you could use that money to buy something that you actually need.<br>  <br>  So overall, money is, from the root of the whole operation, a sign of motivation that promises a better byproduct than the one that you are producing, like the work that the hunters put in to kill a buffalo.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. :)|`|cdy5uIE5aa	Money is essentially time (or rather the illusion of time).  How ever long you spent doing something, you get paid accordingly.  If you went to school to become a doctor you spent a lot of time studying and getting your degree.  You are reimbursed for your time by making a decent amount of money later in life.  If your education stopped at high school, you will get paid less because devoted less time to learning.  <br>  <br>  However, things start to go wrong when time and money have an inverse relationship.  For instance, there isn't enough time in a persons life to get paid what some people are paid.  That is when the monetary system begins to crumble and you get something like what the U.S. is experiencing.  And the same goes when people spend a lot of time and are under paid or not paid at all.|`|wV19G0CLaa	money is the only way to obtain some things in life that can make us happy...<br>  <br>  ie...money can get you to university..get you a diploma.. and that will make you happy because you'll have a better chance of a good job and easier access to money ..<br>  ie...money can get you cute little surprise gifts for your loved ones.. <br>  ie...let's picture a young couple. the gurl's parents are not rich at all..the guy's parents are too selfish to offer anything as a gift for the marriage..this young couple wants to get married.. but they really can't..bcz one of them is studying in university and the other is just in a dead end job..without this magical paper.. they can't have a decent marriage, nor a house, nor a car..nor even think of having kids and all that joy a family brings..<br>  <br>  what is money? just a cruel mean to happiness..|`|y8bFwXZEaa	By saying what money is NOT, this became the most famous explanation of what money IS.<br>  <br>  Since I can't do better, I will simply give you the link.<br>  <br>  And I don't care if anyone votes for this.

AisbApmMaa	the first 3 pictures should not be center. Find a way to move them off center. on a house picture use the deferent angles that the house has to give you a 3D look.

If you would of moved to your roght and shoot it I think if would of been beter. But you did a good job on the color and mixing color.

5wF7FOqwaa	Yeah, if you're interested in wolves, you should read that book. It's fiction, but it still gives a really good insight into the world of wolves and how humans have affected them. Larka, a white wolf, is the main character. If you like The Sight, you should read the second book in the series, Fell.<br>   "In the shadow of an abandoned castle, a wolf pack seeks shelter. the she-wolf 's pups will not be able to survive the harsh transylvanian winter. And they are being stalked by a lone wolf, Morgra, possessed of a mysterious and terrifying power known as the sight. Morgra knows that one of the pups born beneath the castle holds a key to power even stronger than her own-power that could give her control of this world and the next. but the pack she hunts will do anything to protect their own, even if it means setting in motion a battle that will involve all of nature, including the creature the wolves fear the most- Man." <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Sight/David-Clement-Davies/e/9780142408742/?itm=1" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Sig...</a>|`|tNfsKZwgaa	My friend read that and said it wasn't to bad.

Well, I gues you could read the Twilight Series by Stephanie Meyer (I tried those but I didn't like it...I found it kind of boring, but thats just my opinion). The Bartimaeus Trilogy by Jonathan Stroud were very interesting though! :)<br>  <br>  You could got to <a href="http://www.whatshouldireadnext.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatshouldireadnext.com</a><br>  <br>  Just type in a book you enjoyed and its author and you'll get an entire list of novels that are similar to it! :)|`|tG8tFRY8aa	There's always the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer, which is dull in the beginning, but gets more exciting. If you don't want to follow the hype, try Blood and Chocolate by Annette Klause Curtis, or any other titles by the same author (if you've seen the Blood and Chocolate movie, it's nothing like the book).|`|TV7FnzJRaa	I have always liked the Bartimaeus Trilogy by Johnathan Stroud, (its about demon, but not how we think of them), Also, the pendragon series is another good one by D.J.

The KMT were clearly nationalistic and opposed to the Communists.<br>  <br>  Communism is a dogmatic ideology about government - it is quite specific.  Nationalism is a much more vague idea of being supportive of one's country, independent of governmental system.|`|H31b8L2Qaa	no , to be a communist you should be a nationalist but to be a nationalist you should be an imperialist. Our teachers , professors make us misunderstand because real communist  country does not exist. Of course every country have such nationalist stuff such as bursary and some free things. Keep in mind that imperialist countries ( UK , USA , RUSSIA , JAPAN , IRAN ) are killing people. Russia was a communist country but they are now going open- market business. Hope you understood.

You always want the themes from your monologue and song to fit that of the show. You should sing an uptempo song and a comedic monologue. A great song would be My New Philosophy from You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, or What Did I ever See in Him from Bye Bye Birdie.

XvO4iLk0aa	G Don't fail. Use the LDK. Some things take longer because I don't give up my assumptions very easily, but when I do, the LDK always works.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

qdlmy4l8aa	In some respects, I'm a breathing testament to Cooley's "Looking-glass self." In others, it only works if the "self" were the actual mirror instead of the perceived reflection.  <br>  <br>  I formulateD a makeshift idea of who I am by what I think. I explain what I think to other people, sometimes backward, and use their reactions to explain myself to myself. I then apply that explanation to explain myself to the next person, then me again, in that order and so on.<br>  <br>   But, when I say I explain myself to other people, I don't mean to say "Hi, I'm Megan. I'm X, Y, Z. What do you think of me?" I'm referring to the entire process of a relationship. <br>  <br>  So, my factors for the product of "me" change WITH each person, and with the changes IN each person. <br>  <br>  I'm an amalgamation of what every one I've ever met thinks, is thinking, has thought, and will think of ME and HIM/HERSELF, and what I THINK of what everyone I've ever met thinks of me and him/herself. There's never an end, as it's cyclical and dependent. <br>  <br>  To ask if I have a preference between those two is to ask if I prefer to make a cup of coffee with just a coffee filter, or just a mug. <br>  <br>  "M.E." is Most Everyone.|`|CuX4Q4xTaa	I think they are almost the same.  Either way you are trying to justify or explain to yourself, a reason for your actions, or to another person.  You are trying to declare yourself  free of blame; absolve.  We try to demonstrate or prove to be just, right, or valid.  To validate or vindicate ones self for an action, claim, or statement. To make ourselves or others  understand where we are coming from and why we do what we do.  Its a natural process of living.  Although the end does not always justify the means.|`|X3q2DMdmaa	ill never be able to explain myself to some else but explaining myself to myself is pretty screwed intsself so ifounded a new theory just go with the fuc*ing flow of everything and hopefully you never cross the predicament|`|bp2kMAr7aa	They are usually the same thing for me or I am doing both at the same time.|`|YmtNel5haa	I think that I prefer to explain my Self to myself, because I am confusing for me to comprehend myself, I would hate to confuse someone by trying to convey me to them.  wow, does that even make sense?  that is why the shrinks make the big bucks, isn't it??<br>  But that is just me and my ability to communicate is lacking, so I prefer to keep it to myself it's just easier that way.<br>  Besides, what if I haven't got it right?  would I then be giving others the wrong facts about myself, and we'd all be messed up upon our opinions of me, wouldn't we?
gGZz2EGyaa	CFB Valcartier was originally erected as a military training camp in August 1914 as part of the mobilization of the Canadian Expeditionary Force at the onset of World War I. The name Valcartier comes from the town of St. Gabriel de Valcartier, of which a large section was expropriated in order to create the military training camp. Due to its proximity to the port of Quebec, Valcartier became the largest military camp on Canadian soil, including some 32,000 men and 8,000 horses<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have given you a couple of web sites that give good information of the camp.  The third web site is not so hot but it does have a good photograph of the training camp for you to see.
Rt4bJfVAaa	Sadly you are right.  But at the same time it depends on what is taught in schools.  Young people today are taught what modern day thinkers of the 1800s taught.  But prior to that even in American education children were taught about the ancient thoughts of man.  For some reason the educators back looked on such knowledge as sacred and worthy of consideration.  When modern man recognized intellectually that he had no ties with the ancient ways of thought, well put it like this.  A great and wise book says "A people without a vision perish".  And in anther place it says "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge".<br>  <br>  The teaching of today is exclusive for politically correct reasons.  Whereas the teaching of an earlier time was inclusive and acknowledged that man's right to exist comes from God.|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	Yes.  Simply, yes.<br>  <br>  But I believe the concepts of philosophy and critical thinking were meant to include all knowledge.  He would be astounded at the amount of knowledge about the nature of the universe and humanity that we have today.  Think of astrophysics, cosmology.  Of the depth and breadth of insight Darwinian evolutionary thought has given us about what it is to be human , to be self aware.  Of more examples than I can give in a moment here.  Epictetus would be astounded and pleased.  If he could survive the shock  :)|`|RoLcpujNaa	i am not entirely share your awe of ancient Greek philos<br>  although i would never deny their great contribution <br>  they weren't the only ones...<br>  <br>  i agree with Zhuangzi and Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove about not to take anything so seriously, even education ;) when u take something seriously you ruin it<br>  <br>  btw i think education has noting to do with freedom of mind|`|de2a032fd31864b266f9f88bfb56b71eaa	Only the free are free.  Education is entirely irrelevant.|`|XqrjFYgIaa	Nope, but almost. I think the educated are more likely to be free than the uneducated mostly because of exposure. The more exposure one has to the world, to different concepts, people, to questioning and thinking critically--applying the scientific method and knowing when the scientific method doesn't apply--I think the greater our chances are of arriving at a semi-accurate understanding. And the more we understand, the less we are slaves to our misunderstandings. However, when we think of education, we automatically think of K-12 or public and private higher ed. institutions. Yes, much education occurs there (and much indoctrination), but education involves so much more. Life is education; suffering is education; anything can be a lesson for those who wish to learn. I think the most valuable and superior education is the kind that frees you AND the kind that makes you aware you are unfree.|`|5yzLfCWlaa	you are probably right, but what kind of question is this, educated are free? free among what? <br>  scholars of our own age are critical, they have departed area for thinking. Epictetus was free to think for large, lots of things were available for thinking. today Scope isn't available. you can be great thinker today but very few people are intersted in knowing you philosophical ideas and your self. however they would like to invite you at party its like show Business.|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	I don't see how you could ever argue that education, of any kind, would be a crutch.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	You seem to be mistaking "education" for "schooling".  Education is simply the acquiring of skill and knowledge.  An illiterate who knows how to build a house, make furniture, raise crops, tend livestock, and cook a tasty meal is very well educated even if he's never seen the inside of a classroom or ever heard of a Greek Philosopher.  As to comparison on knowledge of Philosophy and Critical thinking only as opposed to an overall practical education, modern scholars at least have the advantage of ready access to Philosophies and points of view from outside their immediate part of the world, which most of the Ancient Greeks lacked.  If you study the writings of that period most of Ancient Greek Philosophy was built around proving their own view right and ignoring all others, hardly a reasonable approach for achieving true scholarship.|`|AA12324252	This is the 1st time I've heard of Epictetus!

As this connection develops over time, you experience a love so deep, strong and complex, that you begin to doubt that you have ever truly loved anyone prior. Your soul-mate understands and connects with you in every way and on every level, which brings a sense of peace, calmness and happiness when you are around them. And when you are not around them, you are all that much more aware of the harshness of life, and how bonding with another person in this way is the most significant and satisfying thing you will experience in your lifetime. You are also all that much aware of the beauty in life, because you have been given a great gift and will always be thankful. <br>  No I do not currently have one :(, but I am hopeful.<br>  StevieB|`|wV19G0CLaa	a soul mate.. we all have a soul and there is another one that matches mine as i can explain it.. where just everything becomes right.. it's just that instant connection you feel when you meet.. and i don't mean sexual connection.. more like intellectual.. the sexual comes after that.. it's when you're not a talkative person and you spend hours and hours talking to her... it's someone who's your best friend plus your lover.. it's someone you can open up to about anything.. it's just one person out there who is your soul mate.. you may find it or not.. you may find it and screw things up.. and you might as well patch things up with time.. because a soul mate just doesn't find a new one... and you just meet them by luck or accident.. so not everybody ends up with the "one" they rather settle for whatever they can get.. in less said, a soul mate is someone you don't fall out of love with..<br>  <br>  i believe i have one..of course i do.. and i believe i'm with her..|`|d8425d76e35821ad87c42fddb2091443aa	they have the same sense of humor, same taste in just about everything, someone you are totally comfortable with and can make you laugh or smile even when you are down. someone you can live with, but can't live without.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	You can finish each others sentences<br>  You know you were always meant to be together<br>  There is more love with this person than you've ever felt or ever will feel<br>  You have true respect for each other|`|jp9OzuXoaa	One you have an indescribably profound connection with.|`|5HyuJ3Bwaa	A person who will be beside you at the worst time in your life and still love you.|`|8ekoa6szaa	The other half of me!|`|4a3463ddc0bb2b09dade7f64bdad7e24aa	True Love is one Soul comprised of two bodies.<br>  -Kahlil Gibran<br>  <br>  I want to be with someone that I will never fear, where understanding one another replaces any fears.<br>  I want my spouse to be my best friend.<br>  Not everyone will be this lucky... <br>  Not in a world full of decit, lies, and cover-ups.<br>  What I have to admit, is that I've been the source of my life (which isn't an easy thing to do).<br>  I need to start searching.|`|tpEDs6R7aa	a soul mate is someone who will always be there no matter what, who you can trust and live your life with. and i think that everyone is destined to be with someone and only one person...their soul mate. and yes i do believe i have one, i just haven't found him yet. =) lol|`|IHbgfrNbaa	I consider soul mates to be fictional.<br>  <br>  I do NOT have one.

Rak2TnaXaa	The recorder.  I'm still trying to master it|`|hNinyCdBaa	The only instrument I have personally tried to make noise out of and not succeeded the first time is the oboe.  That was a disaster.  I can imagine the bassoon is harder.  I practically picked up the trumpet and played a song (with musical background and a fingering chart of course).  Sax is probably the easiest wind instrument to make noise on but the fingerings are more complex and it is difficult to control without blatting.  The fingerings are nearly identical to the flute, which is more difficult to make noise on, but similar to whistling on a water bottle.  Piano is hard because you need coordination, but you don't need to hold anything or blow into anything and you can see the keys.  Clarinet needs the most lung support.  Accordion is heavy and there are a lot of buttons, you need coordination like piano and arm strength.  Tuba you need a lot of air for and it is heavy.  Xylophone (+similar instruments) would take a lot of coordination.<br>  <br>  All in all, I think the hardest would be bassoon, accordion, and Tuba, but with any instrument, it takes lots of talent to play it well.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	I disagree... play both the piano and guitar and they are EASY compared to the OBOE.. it's considered THE MOST DIFFICULT INSTRUMENT to LEARN by nearly all musicians.|`|WjqmPBYjaa	the piano by a long shot all instruments are difficult..but for sum reason ur considered a genius if u play th epiano..mozart, beethoven, etc :)|`|TXaMOQo6aa	i'd say the harp or the drums|`|pnyoaSPVaa	The pedal steel guitar is by far the hardest.

G0wo8ueLaa	Hi Jesus-Is,<br>  <br>  I fully empathize with your attachment to your characters.  We write for the pleasure of writing and the love of our creations - so by all means continue the story!<br>  <br>  I think the power you've given to your antagonist is intriguing - and quite unusual.  It debunks the classic role of villain to give him the power of *creation* when villains usually take on the role of *destruction.*  If you wanted to play into standard ideals of good and evil, you could switch your protagonist's and antagonist's power so that your hero can create with his imagination, and your villain can only destroy what the hero has created (with some caveats and restrictions - i.e. he can not destroy the hero himself).  <br>  <br>  However, if it is your intent to debunk the stereotypes of good and evil  - which personally I find much more interesting -- then I do think it creates a harmonious, parallel conflict for your hero to be a destroyer of those 'bad' things the villain creates.  Again, you can put limits to his power.  This is your world, your characters, your laws in your universe.  You can invent certain laws that prevent your hero from just *poof* destroying the villain.  You also need to put some limits to your villain's abilities, or else he could *poof* destroy the world with a single thought.  If your hero can only destroy that which the villain creates, and only under certain conditions (must be present at the time of creation, must know how it was created, etc.), that can set up interesting plot structures and give your hero an engaging conflict.<br>  <br>  Your villain's power does not have to be (and maybe shouldn't be) as simple as thinking something once and immediately creating it.  Instead, require more effort and focus on his part to will something into being.  There are many people who believe that this phenomenon is true (in a much more subtle way) in real life - look up "the law of attraction."  If you give some subtlety to your villain's power you increase the level of conflict of the story and give his power more credibility.  Same for your hero's power of destruction.<br>  <br>  You state that the paths of your hero and your villain are parallel.  Consider other ways they may be linked.  Do they share some kind of empathic or telepathic connection that can help each to thwart the other?  How did they come to have these powers?  Perhaps they get their powers from the same source; they are, after all, equal and opposite powers, like Yin and Yang, two forces springing from a complete and neutral singularity.<br>  <br>  Another idea:  is it possible for your hero to destroy something *before* your villain creates it?  You get into interesting philosophical questions there.  This allows him a "first strike" initiative - the opportunity to outsmart and outwit your villain by making it impossible to create certain things.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a wonderful idea and I wish you the best of fun and success finishing the story!|`|Er4le3okaa	Your hero can be able to see the future, or read minds, or change appearance..<br>  And you should definitely wirte a sequel, especially if you enjoy it! good luck!|`|BLQHKF0aaa	How about if your hero is able to create a parallel reality to what your villain can think into life? If the villain can make a person come back to life, then how about if the hero can create a parallel reality where the person is undead?

I think every author feels the same way, whether their book is published or not. It's not silly at all to start a sequel. I actually think I'd be a wonderful idea. <br>  <br>  As for the hero's power, the first one that comes to mind is imagining things out of existance, but then there wouldn't be a villain, now would there? ;)|`|vNDV3BMEaa	What about some sort of 'disability' power. Like, if the villain imagines a pen into existence, the hero only has to do <something... not sure what> and the villain will never be able to imagine a pen into existence again.<br>  I'll admit, I kinda stole this idea from The Doomspell Trilogy by Cliff McNish.<br>  <br>  So, yeah, that's my little contribution.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and I know how you feel about getting tied to characters and it won't be silly to write a sequel<br>  <br>  sdj x

Sayers, 1st july 1916."<br>  <br>  Sargeant Matclock was unable to trace whoever had made the donation to the charity shop in Earl Shilton, near Leicester.<br>  <br>  But the keen historian discovered through research that Captain Sayers had died at 27 on the first day of fighting at the Somme.<br>  <br>  The officer, from Gloucestershire, had also fought in the 1915 Galipoli campaign in Turkey with the Fusilliers' 1st Batallion where he was severely wounded.<br>  <br>  After recovering, he was posted to France and promoted to Acting Major.  But he asked to return to the front and became a captain again in the regiment's 20th Battalion.  He died commanding a company at Beaumont Hamel.<br>  <br>  Sargeant Matlock said: "I opnly found out about the gun through a chance conversation with our firarms officers.  It's a remarkable story, and every time I look deeper intoit, it comes up gold.  Hugh Winfield Sayers was a remarkable officer who excelled at everything he did including boxing, hockey, steeplechase and cricket.<br>  <br>  'He went "over the top" at Beaumont Hamel in the mistaken belief that the Germans posed little threat.  Of course, the opposite was true and 19,000 men died that day.<br>  <br>  'All his effects, including the gun, would have beens ent home to his family who had it engraved again, this time in his memory.  It is unusual for a gun to have been used at Gallipoli and at the Battle of the Somme which is what makes it so fare.'<br>  <br>  Unable to trace the gun's present owners, Sargeant Matlock donated it to the Lancashire Fusiliers' Museum in Bury.<br>  <br>  Museum Curator Lieutenant Colonel Michael Glover said: 'It is part of the magic of the museum game that items turn up from the most obscure places.'<br>  <br>  Visit the museum at this link.<br>  <a href="http://www.fusiliersmuseum-lancashire.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fusiliersmuseum-lancashire.or...</a>

HUDjXVOyaa	A swirl can be represented by a spiral line. <br>  A curl can be represented by a line drawn in a haft circle. <br>  There is not much difference except the swirl is more curly, lol. The curl continues to form the sense of swirl in a spiral. <br>  <br>  Perhaps, a swirl has the potencial to express a greater sense of motion. Where the sense of motion created by<br>  a curl can be limited in comparison to swirl.

49472a84fe9634f0f30a66f419d61c8faa	Yours is one of the most extraordinary questions that I've ever seen here. Really. You've gone through so much in such a short time, probably so much more than a lot of people. I really hope that you're writing all of this down, what you've written in your question and everything else that's going on in your life. Please, buy a journal, a diary, even if it's just a spiral-bound notebook from the drugstore and write in it every day. I was fascinated reading every bit of it, and I bet I'm not the only one. I think you'll find that it will help you feel better if you put your thoughts and experiences down on paper; for instance, did you feel better after you posted your question here? I really hope so. Again, most extraordinary.<br>  <br>  For book recommendations I have a few. You might want to try "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls. It's about a woman that had a very difficult childhood, but managed to survive it and become stronger for it. I think you'd like it a lot. It's serious reading but very interesting.<br>  <br>  For pure escapism I'd recommend the "Shopaholic" books by Sophie Kinsella. They've been popular for quite some time and even more so now that there's a film version out. They're light and fluffy but fun to read. The main character is a girl named Becky Bloomwood who loves to shop, and shop, and shop some more. When you read them you can't help but smile and maybe even laugh out loud; they'll help you forget the real world and your troubles for awhile. The titles in the series are:<br>  <br>  Confessions of a Shopaholic (2001) <br>  Shopaholic Takes Manhattan (2002) <br>  Shopaholic Ties The Knot (2002) <br>  Shopaholic & Sister (2004) <br>  Shopaholic & Baby (2007) <br>  <br>  What kind of photography are you interested in? Do you like taking pictures of people? Two of my favorite photographers are Dorothea Lange and Diane Arbus. Lange is famous for her Depression-era photos, especially those of families living in poverty. Arbus took the most interesting photos of ordinary people on the streets of New York. She also did celebrity photos as well but it's her photos of the everyday average man or woman or child walking down the street, in a park, or some other ordinary setting that I really like. Here's links to some of Lange's and Arbus' books:<br>  <br>  Dorothea Lange: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0..." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0...</a><br>  <br>  Diane Arbus: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Diane-Arbus-Apertu..." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Diane-Arbus-Apertu...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and I hope things get better soon.|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	My Goodness child!

ji7WZvC1aa	Toto is either on a leash or carried by Dorothy 90% of the time.  There's one scene where he's "found" by the Scarecrow, TinMan and Lion, so he'll need to be able to stay put when placed by somebody until he's told he can move, and also he may need to run offstage when Dorothy shooes him away in the Wicked Witch's castle.  Basically he needs a calm temperament, be fine with kids (often the Munchkins are played by children) and be very obedient.  I did the show a few years back and we had one dog which we had to get rid of during the rehearsal period as although it looked the part, it was badly behaved and ended up biting one of the kids.  The replacement was the most placid dog in the world; stage fireworks, loud noises and flashing lights didn't upset it in the least!|`|1oSL6ozsaa	I have seen it done before.

ndSzlZKxaa	Hi?<br>  There is a software called dreams mainfestation kit.? Hope the below article will provide you with more info... <br>  ?<br>  Why are some people more successful than others in fulfilling their goals and  dreams? Isn’t it astonishing how some people fail all the time, while others  turn everything they touch into gold? <br>    Is it just dumb luck?  Does God rule over it?  Are some born with successful and predetermined genes?  How To Set Your Success Formula on Autopilot? <br>    Setting goals and  in your life is the single most  undertaking in the entire process of making the life you always dreamed about. Can you imagine that almost 95% of all masses simply don't do this? And the balance of the 5% do it, but only 10% of this small number ever reach their goals. This is the reason why so many masses struggle and businesses fail.<br>   <br>   Tap Into the Infinite Power of Your subconscious mind <br>   <br>   Your subconscious processes about 400 billion bits of information per second and the impulses move at a speed of up to 100,000 mph! Equate this to your conscious mind, which processes only about 2,000 bits of information per second and its impulses move only at 100-150 mph.  Your conscious mind is almost a backward cousin of the subconscious mind.  I am sure you have experienced at some time or another driving you car, and for an instant during the drive, you suddenly became aware that you were driving. Prior to that sudden conscious jolt into the present moment, your conscious mind was busy with thinking and your subconscious mind drove the car – all on its own.<br>   <br>   You might have the firmest desire to achieve something, but as long as your subconscious holds a certain feeling that is not aligned with that desire, nothing will ever happen to manifest the desire.  This is the single most important fact you have to understand. You set your goals with your conscious mind and you reach them with your subconscious mind.The single most important thing to realize is that you set your goals with your conscious mind and you reach them with your subconscious mind.<br>   <br>   There is now a remarkably simple solution for manifesting your goals, dreams and desires in life.  It's called the Dream Manifestation Wizard, an award winning software application that supports and steers you in manifesting exactly what you want.

WshwHtk9aa	Book publishers are hurting in this economy and many ARE starting to hunt down thieves and sue them, just like the record industry did. If they cannot make money from sales, they'll make it from suing thieves. Also, with a statute of limitations of a minimum of 7 years or so in most states, they could come after you anytime for years and years. <br>  <br>  They are also starting to monitor sites like this to find people who are stealing and promoting book theft as a starting point for their efforts. Some are even offering rewards for turning people in. <br>  <br>  Electronic versions of books are as copyrighted as the printed version and taking one is no different than walking into a store and stealing a printed version. If the book is under copyright (and most written after 1923 still are), then yes, downloading it could well land you in trouble.<br>  <br>  Also, you've now posted about it in public forum. If they come after you, you are a guaranteed conviction. you've displayed prior intent and cannot claim ignorance of the law now that you've asked about it, so you are especially prone to litigation if caught. <br>  <br>  If you'd rather risk paying $20,000 and gaining a criminal record instead of just paying $14.95 for the book like most socially functioning individuals do, go ahead and steal it. Remember, while you may want the book for free, that book IS the author's property and source of income. Stealing it is stealing from them. And it can discourage them from writing more books (just research the Stephanie Meyer Midnight Sun situation where she stopped writing a book her fans wanted because it was stolen and leaked online for free). <br>  <br>  Why would you do that to an author you supposedly like? You like them enough to want to read their work, but not pay them for the effort of writing it? Besides being illegal, it is socially inept and rude. Would you want someone doing that to you?<br>  <br>  Finally, the fact that you "might not get caught" does not make the activity legal. It IS illegal if you get caught or not. Wrong IS wrong, if you get caught or not. <br>  And it is not up to the government to monitor such activity but the publishing companies and rights holders. And while they may not have done much in the past, as I said above, they ARE doing more now and will continue to do more in coming years and slow economy. Your chances of getting caught ARE going up.

XGsuxRR2aa	You're always teaching yourself to do anything you're learning. Your brain is doing all the work, not someone else. But that's semantics.<br>  <br>  I'd say I'd be learning on my own long as I wasn't having someone directly interact with me for my lessons. So basically long as no person is showing you how to play and giving you advice in response to seeing you play.<br>  <br>  So lessons online, books, etc, all learning yourself, teaching yourself, whatever. Paid lessons or friend showing you how... nope. So yes, you are teaching yourself.|`|0vfX40Qxaa	I don't know of any one who only learned by ear, everyone needs help at the beginning.  Yes you are teaching yourself, and it can be done, but it is a good idea to get some lessons especially at the start so you avoid any bad habits you will have to break in order to advance.  Try taking a class at your local Community College or Adult School these are often very cheap, or sometimes even free.  <br>  <br>  Here are a couple of web sites that can help.<br>  <br>  Justin guitar is a great site for free lessons, and learning music theory.<br>  <a href="http://www.justinguitar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.justinguitar.com/</a><br>  <br>  Chordie is a search engine that gets tabs and chord sheets from all over the web,  check out the public song books, you will probably find a few that match your personal tastes in music.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chordie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chordie.com/</a><br>  <br>  edit; sorry forgot the chordie link|`|0AUPrCMZaa	teaching yourself is not using a physical teacher.|`|3XLnDyupaa	You're teaching yourself.<br>  That's partcially how I learned.<br>  I recommend guitar tabs, if you want to learn a good riff.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Yes you would be learning the guitar on your own. The only way you wouldn't be learning guitar on your own is if you were to go to guitar lessons with another person or enrolled into a guitar class. Even then though you are technically learning it on your own, because you can take those techniques and play it by yourself. Also the teacher can't learn for you, so you are still learning by yourself.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	The person who is so arrogant or so delusional that they think they can teach theirself to play the guitar for free off the internet.. have a FOOL for a student.

Were any restrictions placed on your use of the material? This already to some extent answered above.<br>  <br>  There were no restrictions. Mellon's papers are massive and scattered: personal and family papers in Washington; business papers in Pittsburgh; art collecting papers in New York, LA, Moscow and St Petersburg; and his official Treasury papers also in DC. And, of course, Mellon corresponded with an astonishing range of people, so he turns up in many archives across the country.

Mellon’s financial history enabled him to construct a plan to cut taxes, tariffs and the national debt from $26 billion in 1921 to around $16 billion in 1930 (United States Department of the Treasury). A.W. authored the book Taxation: The People’s Business in 1924 outlining his thoughts on taxes and governmental action. He was also a large supporter of “trickle down” government (Spartacus Educational).

rmO4niJaaa	"Hands Resist Him" was a painting created by California painter Bill Stoneham in 1972. He said the picture was of him at the age of five accompanied by a female doll, and the glass paneled door was separating the real world from alternate universes or possibilities. It was soon displayed at an LA art museum. It is said that a year later, both the art critic and the owner of the gallery had died. It was purchased by actor John Marley. After he died, it was sold on Ebay in the year 2000. The seller claimed that the characters moved at night, and they would often leave the painting. Many said the boy was trying to get out of the painting to avoid the doll holding an object thought to be a gun. It is actually a dry cell battery with tangled wires. Many who viewed the painting felt very ill and often had seizures. <br>  <br>  It is indeed a very disturbing painting.

Indian disguises for the Boston Tea Party as well as other protests and demonstrations in the colonies were a common practice.

dwPxU89Vaa	I understand you want a beginner equipment, that tells me you wont be on a safari trip to the amazonas, so you can start with a 70-300 mm lens, which you can find for less that $200, and a basic dsrl such as the canon rebel, that is not the best as you say, but it can let you start , dont forget the tripod|`|bocePfyYaa	Here is a list of compact and SLR-like cameras that have a telephoto reach of more than 400mm, are 8-10MP, and have shutter and aperture priority:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?page=1&remove=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a><br>  <br>  If you want a new camera, this is the best you can do for around $300. Not that these are bad cameras. Quite the contrary. They make excellent cameras for shooting vacations and your family and friends. They are not bad for wildlife. But you can not change the lenses. They are ideal for someone who wants a more portable camera that can do a little of everything, and these cameras will. Any one of them would be a good camera and plenty of people have shot with compacts and SLR-like cameras and won contests and sold images. So you can make some money even using a smaller camera.<br>  <br>  If you insist on a DSLR, you will have to get a used one with that budget. I would say to find a used entry level DSLR like a Nikon D40 or D60, or a Canon XS or XSI, or a Sony a200 or a300 that has a lens with it. This initial set-up is not going to allow you to do much wildlife photography in a natural setting. But, if you either end up with a telephoto lens (say with a reach of 200mm or 300mm) with the camera or can buy one-you can find a used one on B&H or Adorama for $50-150-then you could go to a wildlife sanctuary or to the zoo and practice shooting wildlife in the meantime.  The Tamron 200-500 could make a good wildlife lens at about $700 (?-I think). Another favorite for those not willing to spend $5,000-10,000 for a lens is the Bigma.

I don't know much about agents, but be very alert on what agent you choose.<br>  The thing about acting is that most of the time you have to be traveling. But it pays off.<br>  Honestly, if you really want acting, you should not give up. never.<br>  some will say..''hey acting is not for you-get out'' well it hopefully wont be that harsh but you get the idea. <br>  You will be rejected..like everyone else. The thing is that you need to work very hard and you need to be yourself. Because when you are yourself that's when casting directors know if you are good for the part. Like i said, don't feel bad if you are rejected at first- it feels horrible. but hey maybe you'll master the next audition- a casting director might something that they couldn't Find in anyone else- like your smile or the way you laugh or the way you talk..etc.<br>  go for it.<br>  <br>  best wishes<br>  -ana<br>  <br>   “Life's real failure is when you do not realize how close you were to success when you gave up.”|`|B359bLqsaa	not every older movie star started out as a child actor.  it might be a bit much to think you will be the next Angelina Jolie, or even become famous, but you may still be able to find some jobs based on your own merit.

Stranger things have happened, but just have a plan B just in case.|`|W4Dek41Jaa	NO GO FOR IT!|`|Mig6O93Naa	Not by age, but your family is a huge problem. I know nothing of the CQU curriculum for drama. but universities in the US are notoriously poor in preparing people to be actors. I suspect it is the same in most schools in Australia.  You have to take all the degree nonsense when you just want to learn how to become an actor. Waste of time in most cases. I advise aspiring actors and I have taught acting for 50 years.  As a retired university theatre program director I know that you have a very difficult goal to reach and that a degree is no help. What you need to do is get acting experience in dramatic society plays  But in the final analysis unless you live where movies are being made, it is an impossible dream.|`|AJEYXzIUaa	go for it , but expect that it will take you away from your family if you succeed .|`|9sOATTE5aa	Its never too late, one of my best friends great-grandmothers broke into the industry in her 80's. But even though you can always break into the industry, having a 2 year old and a 2 year old can be a problem. If you do get into the industry it is a very time consuming career, especially if you break into movies. Would you be willing to spend months at a time away from your family? And also take into account where you live. It is hard to break into the industry if you don't live near or are willing to move to one of the capitals.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Not at all - you have a better chance than most people on here. There are a lot more roles for older women than those in their older twenties...and, of course, by the time you get through school and get your Equity card and stuff, and are in a place where you can act with your children, you'll be in good shape, age-wise.<br>  <br>  (An option would be to teach drama while your kids are growing up and work on building your resume, then actually try for a career once they're older.)|`|I5FJj6tXaa	Never is too late....for your dreams.. just if you like this Hazlo.. creeme nunca es tarde para nada ademas seria un buen ejemplo para tus hijos|`|O05HQLohaa	Acting like any career takes time.  If you were to ask is it too late to be a pilot or a banker, the answer is the same. If you can get the training and work toward your goal you have a chance.  My recomendations are<br>  Becoming an Actress<br>  Find every opportunity in your traveling distance that does Plays or Musicals.  Check the schools and community groups as well as professional. Contact them and ask to be notified of any auditions.  <br>  If you do not get a part, offer to help in any way (paint scenery, usher etc.) Just being around the production you will learn a lot.<br>  Study Dance, Music and Acting.  You must be able to do at least one great and the others well enough to let the others work around you.  Find classes or instructors that have produced talent.<br>  Work on your image.  You have to be a go getter, with lots of confidence and at the same time come across as humble.  <br>  Develop work ethics.  Never be late. Never be absent. Always be attentive.  Always show respect for others, even when you do not think they deserve it.<br>  If and when approached by a talent agent or agency.  Check them out carefully.  <br>  Agents<br>  They do not look at your picture and resume and go out and try to find you a job.<br>  You should give them enough information about your skills and decent photos of you.<br>  Almost all agents know where to find out about casting for theater and movies.  <br>  When these castings are announced they look through their files to see who might have a chance. If you appear to have a chance they will notify you.<br>  Until you have found work several times they are not going to go out and try to sell you to a producer.<br>  Read these two web sites<br>  <a href="http://www.agentassociation.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.agentassociation.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sag.org/content/find-agent" rel="nofollow">http://www.sag.org/content/find-agent</a>|`|4wRVxL6Xaa	You can still go for it. You're never too old for acting.. If you're good, you'll good. <br>  <br>  For the experience part, you will gain it from school or learn it as you go. Just go to school, do your best and try the best you can. <br>  <br>  The only bad thing is, you have a 2 year old and 3 year old. The reason why I say this is a bad thing is because you won't be able to see them as much. when you're in the acting business, you need to get up early and stay late. <br>  <br>  Other than that, your dream can definitely come true. It's not too late.. just try your best and strive for it.. good luck!|`|nQ3kFPMVaa	It's never too late to start, but it does make it harder, especially in Australia. Most people in their 20s who are actors have spent as much as 10 years already involved in theatre. I do recommend attending the BA, but you'll have to do a lot of work to catch up. Brisbane is also possibly not the best place for a career in acting. You probably will end up doing teaching, like most of the Aussie actors who have graduated. <br>  <br>  Also, Theatre Doc's advice might be valid in the US, but in Australia you simply can't get any professional acting work unless you have a degree. You'd have to have about 20 years of experience doing amateur theatre and indie films to be able to compete with a 20 year old out of NIDA or WAAPA; and even then it's unlikely you'd get an agent without exceptional talent or good looks. Just having NIDA, VCA or any other university on your CV will keep it from going into the rubbish pile. There are just too many actors here and not enough roles, and those who get them are always going to be the ones with training *and* experience.<br>  <br>  I would also add that having very young kids will make it difficult for you; theatre means a lot of weekends and late nights, rehearsals and performances. Your course may be just as full time as your kids school hours. You'll have to really consider whether or not you want to spend your free time in rehearsals, rather than the weekends with your kids. Having said that, it's not a deterrent, but it's just a very big factor to consider. You may get into acting and find that it's just too much of a strain on your family. You also probably should have gotten some acting experience before applying for the course so you could be certain that you want to pursue this; about 10-20% of students drop out (just a guess from prior experience) of acting courses for a variety of reasons, one including not being able to sustain interest or the level of commitment. Additionally, most actors in Australia can't afford to work solely in theatre, and this means it's hard to earn an income when you're a parent of two very young kids.<br>  <br>  This is what I normally advise young actors getting into the Aussie business (at least you've got a good start, which is a uni course):<br>  <br>  First off, check out local auditions at theatre.asn.au, or read up on Aussietheatre.com. If you're keen, pay for a membership at QuietOnSet.com.au or Artshub.com.au; they list heaps of auditions every day around Australia. Another good site is screenhub.com.au.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to visit the first link, head to the FAQ section, and read about finding agents in Australia, how to find work, etc. It also has a lot of stuff about dodgy Aussie agents to avoid. There's heaps of free info there for new actors, and is practically the best place you can find info for emerging actors. There's also a huge list of companies that you can search by suburb.<br>  <br>  AGENTS DO NOT COST MONEY - IF THEY ASK FOR FEES UPFRONT, THEY ARE DODGY.<br>  <br>  Visit www.alliance.org.au, the actor's union for Australia and join.<br>  <br>  If you don't have experience don't expect a professional role or an agent. I suggest you use the next years to build up experience, and then try applying for a local uni course. Trust me, there are too many actors out there and not enough roles. Everyone wants to be in Home and Away and Neighbours; very few actually do it.<br>  <br>  Those Aussie actors who are in Hollywood have spent the better part of 20 years developing their career - first in Australia, and then overseas. Do yourself a favour; take some classes and do some shows first.<br>  <br>  Think about attending WAAPA, NIDA or VCA or one of the many great courses out there (there are heaps) when you're ready.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of indie films being made in Australia, for which you can audition for without an agent; check the first link for examples, or Quiet On Set.<br>  <br>  DON'T sign up for one of those American talent sites. They are scams and never have anything for Australian auditions.

In some ways it is similar to George Orwell's much earlier Down and Out in Paris and London as well as German investigative reporter Günter Wallraff's Ganz Unten (The Lowest of the Low).<br>  <br>  The events related in the book took place between spring 1998 and summer 2000. The book was first published in 2001 by Metropolitan Books. An earlier version appeared as an article in the January 1999 issue of Harper's magazine.

He is a part of everything, and the characters all interact with him.

If you google Trimalchio and Gatsby you should find it.

oVeGMNsLaa	Right now, erotic literature is actually pretty well-accepted.  Of course, it may get snarky comments, but big publishers- who wouldn't touch it a while back- know now that it's a big cash cow and routinely publish it.<br>  <br>  Can you make a living out of this sort of writing?  It depends.  If you're dedicated to it, of course you can.  There are lots of respected modern erotica writers- M. Christian, Emma Holly, Alison Tyler, Rachel Kramer Bussell, etc..  Unfortunately, as someone else noted, right now, the market is pretty well saturated.  Everybody thinks they can write dirty stories, and it's getting harder to break in.  But it's definitely possible.<br>  <br>  If you want, you should ask Adrienne if you can sign up to Erotica-readers.com's mailing list, which routinely sends out various calls for submissions.  Also, just get familiar with the genre, more than the rather older "Delta Of Venus", which is now considered a "classic".<br>  <br>  And this blog is a good cautionary warning:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.blowfish.com/culture/greta-christina-the-erotic-fiction-anthology-a-victim-of-its-own-success/1030" rel="nofollow">http://blog.blowfish.com/culture/greta-c...</a><br>  <br>  But good luck!|`|lymCWLcaaa	People do like these books thr just ashamed to admit it..!!

There were all different aged kids in the classroom, from 8-15.

YipD1QKFaa	Considering you play piano and are learning violin already, I think a good choice would be a brass instrument, such as the trumpet or euphonium.  Piano and violin are both great because they really help to train your ear, and that's why I'd suggest something in the brass family.  They're all instruments where listening is tantamount, and, let's be honest, listening is really the key when it comes to performing music well.  By training your ear, you'll become a better musician all-around.<br>  <br>  Trumpet is fun, and pretty easy to learn, in my opinion (I started on clarinet and learned to play trumpet about ten years later).

HAEjoPVRaa	1500 to 1100 was the Late Bronze Age, a time of expansion of greatness for the Mediterranean World. Around 1500 BCE the Egyptian Empire was still one of the most powerful in the world but its power had been diminshed over the years. 1500 was about the time that the Hittites, also known as the Hatti, became a serious world power. The invaded Mesopotamia and began to carve out an empire from Troy in the west, south to  Kadesh, and east towards the Caucasus mountains. Assyria also had its routes in the time but their real empire would not begin until later. <br>  <br>  Mycenaean Greece, called the Ahhiyawa by the Hittites, became a major empire too, even listed among the great kings of the region. All the kings called their equals in war and economy Great Kings and Brothers. <br>  <br>  The real change began to occur around 1300 BCE and the last 200 years of the Late Bronze Age were really had the most change. Egypt and the Hittites had a major battle, at Kadesh that ended in a draw (most text books say that the Egyptians won which is false). Neither side gained any territory and it ended in a peace contract for eternity. Following the end of warfare with Egypt the Ahhiyawa began to invade Hittite held lands in southern Anatolia from their base at Milliwanda, now Miletus. The Ahhiyawa never really invaded themselves but incited rebellion in certain areas called the Arzawa Lands and the Seha River Land. One man, named Piyamaradush, invaded Wilusa (Troy) and burned Lesbos. he is thought to possibly be Achilles of myth. <br>  <br>  But the Ahhiyawa were eventually kicked out of Miletus by the Hittite King, Tudhaliya IV. They were also removed from the list of Great Kings. That was the last great moment of the Hittites because after that, around 1200 and continuing for 100 years was the invasion of the Sea Peoples who destroyed everything in their path. Unfortunately there is hardly any archeological evidence to support them and we only have the written work of Ramesess III, who is not reliable, and some texts from Alasiya (Cypress) and Urgarit. But what is significant is that all the major palaces on the Greek mainland, Anatolia, and parts of the Middle East, were all destroyed. Following the destruction the land was forced into a Dark Age that lasted in Greece until around 700 BCE. Egypt was the only land not to be terribly affected by the dark age but they were only a shell of their former glory.  <br>  <br>  Some cool facts about the time period: <br>  <br>  The Hittites almost got control of Egypt after Tutankhamen's death because his widow asked for a Hittite prince to marry her. Zadanta, the son of Suppiluliuma III was sent and murdered on the way. <br>  <br>  Wilusa had a king named Alaksandus which matches Paris' name of Alexandros.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more look at the book Kingdom of the Hittites on google books or buy it. It is fantastic and i learned a lot from it.|`|shVgCizBaa	Dawn of civilization<br>   <br>  The Fertile Crescent in the 2nd millennium BC.Further information: Fertile Crescent, Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, and History of the Levant<br>  Two of the first human civilizations began in the eastern Mediterranean area. Civilization first developed in Mesopotamia beginning with Sumer in the 4th millennium BC. Soon after, the Nile River valley of ancient Egypt was unified under the Pharaohs in the 4th millennium BC, and civilization quickly spread through the Fertile Crescent to the east coast of the sea and throughout the Levant, which happens to make the Mediterranean countries of Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon part of the cradle of civilization. These areas shared similar climates and geographies, but it was more difficult to spread technologies and crops, such as flax, lentil, peas, barley, and cotton to other portions of the Mediterranean basin.<br>  <br>  In time, large empires developed in Asia Minor, such as the Hittites. The main expansion was delayed until ships sturdy enough to cross the sea were developed. Cyprus and the other islands developed, and the Minoan civilization flourished on the island of Crete. While the river valley civilizations always had larger populations, the trading societies on the coast of the sea soon became the most prosperous, and rose to power.<br>  : Classical antiquity<br>  The two most notable of these were the Greek city states and the Phoenicians. The Greeks expanded throughout the Black Sea and south through the Red Sea. The Phoenicians spread through the western Mediterranean including North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. The Phoenician heartland in the Levant was still dominated by powers rooted east in Mesopotamia or Persia, and the Phoenicians often provided the naval forces of the Achaemenid Persian Empire.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Mediterranean_region" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a>                   Fertile Crescent, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Cre...</a>         Mesopotamia<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia</a>          Ancient Egypt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egy...</a>     History of the Levant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Levant" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a>|`|rOkWXbEUaa	Its not much but I've put a some of websites below as pointers:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_civilization" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_c...</a>  - this covers the period 1600BCE to 1150 BCE<br>  <br>   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom</a>  Egypt 1570BCE - 1070BCE <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age_...</a>   covers the  main civilizations in the area their collapse and possible reasons

iNXqiDIYaa	i would imagine that this list includes many that you have not yet covered at school - those printed are less than half those at the link (yahoo cuts the answer!)<br>  <br>  Alien space bats, a plot device sometimes used in alternate history to create a point of divergence that would otherwise be implausible. <br>  Anthropomorphism, a form of personification, taking human-like characteristics to both living and non-living objects. <br>  Author surrogate, a character who acts as the author's spokesman. Sometimes the character may intentionally or unintentionally be an idealized version of the author. A well known variation is the Mary Sue or Gary Stu (self-insertion). <br>  Back-story, the story "behind" or "before" the events being portrayed in the story being told; past events or background for a character that can serve to color or add additional meaning to current circumstances. Provides extra depth to the story by anchoring it to external events, real or imagined. <br>  Breaking the fourth wall, when the author or a character addresses the audience directly (also known as direct address). This may acknowledge to the reader or audience that what is being presented is fiction, or may seek to extend the world of the story to provide the illusion that they are included in it. <br>  Chekhov's gun, the insertion of an object of apparent irrelevance early on in a narrative, the purpose of which is only revealed later on in the story. See also foreshadowing and repetitive designation. <br>  Conceit, an extended metaphor associated with metaphysical poetry, designed to push the limits of the imagination in order to portray something indescribable. <br>  Defamiliarization, technique of forcing the reader to recognize common things in an unfamiliar or strange way, in order to enhance perception of the familiar. <br>  Deleted affair, telling of a romantic relationship, but not referred to in the current story. <br>  Deus ex machina (a machination, or act of god), a plot device dating back to ancient Greek theater, where the primary conflict is resolved through a means that seems unrelated to the story (i.e. a God comes down out of nowhere and solves everything, saving the character from peril). In modern times, the Deus ex machina is often considered a clumsy method, to be avoided in order not to frustrate readers or viewers. <br>  Dramatic visualization, "the representing of an object or character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience". This technique dates back to the Arabian Nights.[1] <br>  Epic Theater, a technique popularized by 20th century playwright Bertolt Brecht, in which the audience is "alienated" or "distanced" from the emotion of the play. <br>  Epiphany, a literary work or section of a literary work presenting, usually symbolically, such a moment of revelation and insight. <br>  Epistolary novel, a novel in the form of a series of documents, usually letters or e-mails exchanged between the characters. Classic examples include Pamela by Samuel Richardson (1740), The Expedition of Humphry Clinker by Tobias Smollett (1771), Les Liaisons dangereuses by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos (1782) and Dracula by Bram Stoker (1897). <br>  False documents, fiction written in the form of, or about, apparently real, but actually fake documents. Examples include Robert Graves's I, Claudius, a fictional autobiography of the Roman emperor, H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon, and the Flashman series by George MacDonald Fraser. The short stories of Jorge Luis Borges are often written as summaries or criticisms of books that in actuall do not exist. <br>  Fictional fictional character, a character whose fictional existence is introduced within a larger work of fiction, or a character in a story within a story. Early examples include Panchatantra and Arabian Nights. See also frame story. <br>  Finger Posting, where casual details are inserted so that a revelation will not seem disconnected from the story. <br>  Flashback (or analeptic reference), general term for altering time sequences, taking characters back to the beginning of the tale, for instance. <br>  A Flashforward, also called prolepsis, is an interjected scene that takes the narrative forward in time from the current point of the story. Flashforwards are often used to represent events expected, projected, or imagined to occur in the future. They may also reveal significant parts of the story that has not yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. This can be seen in the television series Lost. <br>  Foreshadowing, hinting at events to occur later. Giving an idea to what's going to happen in the upcoming events. See also formal patterning, repetitive designation and Chekhov's gun. <br>  Formal patterning, "the organization of the events, actions and gestures which constitute a narrative and give shape to a story; when done well, formal patterning allows the audience the pleasure of discerning and anticipating the structure of the plot as it unfolds". This technique dates back to the Arabian

Good question.|`|ek8iGsRfaa	Actually I think she uses both of those to describe him...if I'm not mistaken. I've only read that book once so I'm not sure. <br>  <br>  I think Greek Gods are too cool to even be mentioned in a Stephenie Meyer novel personally...but maybe that's just me.|`|phH2dVYZaa	LOLOLOL HE ATE HIS CHILDREN IS THAT A COINCIDENCE<br>  <br>  I think not!<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  he was described as the ADONIS statue and the statue of David and marble and ice and...<br>  <br>  Wow I hate Stephenie Meyer that much more|`|BTkHkkJTaa	edward basically looks like Kronos.  Can anyone else see this resemblance?|`|0jlG2clBaa	Greek Gods are supposed to be the most beautiful things ever.|`|zxnvdSS3aa	because she sees him as perfect just like a god|`|tZF1FO7saa	that is edward eating bella he just couln't resist!!|`|I0OPIk16aa	A Greek god..? And an angel.. Hm. I found this.<br>  <br>  "Physical appearance<br>  Like all the vampires in the Twilight series, Edward is described by Bella as being impossibly beautiful. At various points in the series, she compares him to the mythical Greek god Adonis. His skin is "like marble"—very pale, ice cold, and sparkles in the sunlight. She describes his facial features as being perfect and angular—high cheekbones, strong jawline, a straight nose, and full lips. His hair, which is always messy, retains the unusual bronze shade that he inherited in his human life from his biological mother. His eyes, once green, are now described as a gold. His appearance changes if he goes long without feeding: his eyes darken, becoming almost black, and purple bruises appear beneath his eyes. Edward is 6'2", and has a slender but muscular body."<br>  <br>  Seriously.. A supermodel? Are you kidding? Supermodels are..human. He's supposed to be inhumanly beautiful.|`|b1cVZbX7aa	Maybe she thinks that greek gods are so beautiful to be described as Edward. But seriously, this picture of Kronos was looking excactly like Edward. maybe this is not a co-incidence. Edward is so bad that he'll not even mind to eat his children.|`|x8RA1ENvaa	She just wants to get it across everyone that he is reallyyyy good looking.<br>  she doesnt want to say supermodel cuz that what a normal person would say, she wants her books to be different, u know?|`|RrtUV5wcaa	she described him like that because she sucks at describing things. or because that's how she wants the reader to imagine him, cause she probably assumed that all greek gods are hot.|`|ZZ1RbxuKaa	Well that's just one of the greek gods, so was most likely she was describing him as unreal in a way. But maybe (just maybe) you may have a point about Kronos|`|8nZtWHiBaa	hes as hot as a god and gods were divine... except for a few kronos and the underworld god (was it pluto or hades cant remember which is roman and which is greek) r not divine cause there jobs were evil<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this makes sense :)|`|WQcxODKLaa	if i remember right, the human people described him as a greek god . the other vampires didnt because they knew what he really was .|`|4s1PX9cmaa	because supermodel good looks cannot begin to describe him. even gods would look merely handsome next to him. and i don't know if that is a coincidence b ut probably cuz aren;t there many greek gods?|`|jpqL8BzEaa	Yeah but Greek gods were always naked, Edward was hardly ever naked.. thank god..<br>  <br>  Hey wait! What? A coincidence? I never bothered reading all of them, so does Edward eat Renesesmee or something?|`|o6IPqzrJaa	I can see a resemblance here, between the greek god kronos  and edward....|`|QzT6DV0Aaa	I think she says it so people will understand that he is so amazing like a god..<br>  I dont know really.... But I <3 Edward|`|aBh7uZkuaa	yep <br>  that's edward cullen<br>  lolz|`|59nnnZOAaa	hmm i see what  you mean but who cares he's hot|`|nvD6Cej8aa	weird|`|qK8wcP2Aaa	oh my freakin god! that Kronos nearly gave me a heart attack.. dude, you should've warned me..|`|fkTb2TiYaa	well i'm pretty sure stephanie meyer wasn't comparing him to the greek god Kronos probably more like Zeus or that other one that has to do with the sun. (w.e. his name it) and she described them all as models when she first saw them so she is probably mixing it up<br>  p.s. kronos is the worst (or evil) god so i'm pretty sure she wasn't implying him|`|Q3QEZ5qeaa	well, the guy who played him in the movie is disgusting.<br>  but in the book i guess it says that cause everyone would be like "Holy crap hes sexier then a greek god, I want one!!!"<br>  but i guess greek gods weren't really all that 'luscious'|`|11Zxe7J5aa	She is refering to god-like looks. The Gods were supposed to be very beautiful. Its a figure of speach.|`|0q33jZCaaa	because she wanted to get the idea that he is perfect across everyones mind.|`|GZZyJJfZaa	its just a description|`|qFmD6kDpaa	well dunnnoooo but robert does look damn gud|`|PYK3FzbHaa	i cant stand it !!!!!<br>  <br>  but apparently its just me!!!<br>  <br>  twilight !!!
Rt4bJfVAaa	It is because some people don't realize that God will allow people to think about life "out of the box".  No two people can agree exactly 100% on the same thing or one of them is not thinking and one is agreeing with the other person completely and not thinking for their self.<br>  <br>  So do not be stressed out about that.  Just acknowledge these differences in your mind.  If what they think does not agree with what you think then rather than argue find the source as to why they think that way.  Then go to the source.<br>  <br>  Personally I rely on sources that have been around for thousands of years that are written now.  But before they were written they were taught as oral truth and passed from generation to generation.  I think truth that never changes from one generation to the next is reliable for me.  But that's just me.  Later.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	The question indicates you are neither a realist nor an optimist.|`|GOKlnTfbaa	I feel the same way. I totally consider those people HUGE hypocrites and retards. When I talk to those people I just go along with them. That way I just avoid conflict. Then elsewhere I speak the truth.
AA12343309	There aren't any websites that will tell you things like that.  You might have heard some people say they have found that they are descended from a royal or noble personage on the web, but let me tell you unless they have traced their ancestry generation by generation back to that person with DOCUMENTS/RECORDS they don't know if they are or not.  <br>  <br>  You have to trace your ancestors starting with yourself and working back.  <br>  <br>  My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene..." rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.
8QKgkOZfaa	A cartoon I watched when I was little. There was a male character....and he inspired my "imaginary friend", who eventually became the model for my main character in my book-in-progress. Music, especially, in broadway shows. <br>  <br>  And my friend, who I've known since first grade, who published a book last year.|`|KrWSgCORaa	I like the fact that I could give a person the emotion of anger, with just words.|`|GW2i2qqUaa	I don't know. I never think of the source. That I don't know I fear that one day it may leave me.|`|isZ8eb98aa	Well, other books and writers. Especially Amelia Atwater Rhodes. She published her first book at 13. Well, she inspired me to write young, because when I was little I thought only adults could write books (:p). <br>  Also, I decided to start writing so I didn't explode. :)<br>  <br>  -Tila.
TM34SdAnaa	Well, for starters, DON'T make her some unbearably beautiful girl, that is never a good road to go down, give them some basic weaknesses without making them Bella Swan-type needs help to tie her shoes, or godlike. <br>  This is a good test to see if your character's a Mary/Gary Sue:<br>  <a href="http://katfeete.net/writing/marysue.html" rel="nofollow">http://katfeete.net/writing/marysue.html</a>|`|CjPtAEzmaa	It's good to have at least one character who doesn't like the character in question for legitimate reasons. Or, have  a friend of the character get mad at him/her at one point for a good reason. Flaws could be anything: they don't think before they speak, they care too much about themselves, they have trouble grasping reality, they don't trust people enough, they trust people too much, they expect everyone to be like them, they run away from problems, they're too confrontational, they make too big of a deal about things, they try to downplay important things, etc. etc. etc. :)|`|Th3bifTWaa	Create a personality for her as far away from Isabella Swan's personality. [Twilight] . Also, don't base your character on yourself at all .<br>  <br>  Follow those two simple steps, and you're well on your way ! <br>  ;D|`|KtS7SUDWaa	The should be the opposite of Bella Swan.|`|j7D3Sazraa	Just make your character the anti-Bella.|`|FNwYzjogaa	Give them somewhat average looks<br>  Give them personality flaws <br>  Give your character a stutter<br>  Make them unbelievably vain <br>  Make them a narcissist, <br>  Make them over weight, <br>  Make them very socially awkward, <br>  Have the opposite sex find them unattractive<br>  Give them normal hair and eye colors<br>  Please, for the love of god, do not make them hate themselves when it's clear everyone in the story thinks otherwise.<br>  <br>  Remember these are just suggestions, they dont have to be this extreme. Just remember to balance out their good traits with bad ones. make the character realistic. <br>  <br>  Alson I would avoid giving them any sort of mental illness because they require a lot of research and it's very easy to screw up a mental illness.

HkXYGAOdaa	Here's a very romantic poem by the famed Scottish poet, Robby Burns, who also wrote the lyrics to Auld Lang Syn we all sing at the arrival of the New Year :)<br>  <br>  It's written in old English, and that's the charm of it:<br>  <br>  <br>  A Red, Red Rose<br>  <br>  <br>  O my luve's like a red, red rose. <br>  That's newly sprung in June;<br>  O my luve's like a melodie <br>  That's sweetly play'd in tune.<br>  <br>  As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,<br>  So deep in luve am I;<br>  And I will love thee still, my Dear,<br>  Till a'the seas gang dry.<br>  <br>  Till a' the seas gang dry, my Dear,<br>  And the rocks melt wi' the sun:<br>  I will luve thee still, my Dear,<br>  While the sands o'life shall run.<br>  <br>  And fare thee weel my only Luve!<br>  And fare thee weel a while!<br>  And I will come again, my Luve,<br>  Tho' it were ten thousand mile!<br>  <br>  ----by Robert Burns<br>  <br>  "Till a'the seas gang dry" means until all the waters on earth have gone dry.<br>  <br>  "weel" is old English for "well"
z4Yeofq8aa	Trade involves people from different countries living in each others society so obviously there is some exchange of cultural and religious values. The Hanseatic league was formed mainly of north German protestant states and it's no coincidence that the countries they traded with the most were those where protestantism flourished such as Sweden and Scotland for example.|`|jpqL8BzEaa	Do you attend a prestigious university or something?

9u74rP70aa	you could stitch into the wool of the crochet, or you could place some hemming web on where you are wanting to embroied and then trim the acces off.
YOt6uTSzaa	Wow...you said a mouthful.... something that most everyone has ever felt more times then they could even recall....I fact it all seems to be where ever you find the good or seek to be good, the bad is right behind it to destroy it.<br>  So it seems to me you need a break, a time to gather yourself and all that goodness you carry to restore it. I think your idea sounds just right, a time, a place, a purpose for recouping your energy's, your spirit of good before the bad overcomes you.   (HUG and PEACE BE)|`|YmtNel5haa	You have accurately described some of it.<br>  I would like to remind you that there are people that do the right thing and really need help. and even if the parents don't do the right thing, should their children pay the price?|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Yup. People suck sometimes babe, and sometimes they don't. Don't read to much into it. Keep the good, and leave the bad behind. Dwelling on this will do you no good, because it never ends. The good and bad will be there for your entire life...you simply have to weed through it,.. just like the rest of us.
SDiYtubGaa	The two states you have described aren't mutually exclusive as you made them sound, with exceptions. To be calm and relaxed all the time would be to live like a man who appears composed and refined, but to others he would seem to be a miserable man, whose role 'the others' would hate to take up. Precisely, this calm and relaxed man is a nihilist, who no longer can be considered as 'living'.<br>          Somebody constantly working for a long term goal(irrespective of whether or not he calls himself an objectivist), may sound like a really inspirational one. But lo!, only explore him to find the kind of stress he bears. He suppresses his needs of relaxation and joy. His state is not something you would envy. Barring these people, everybody at every moment, if enjoying the current moment has his goals nagging him now and then and vice-versa.<br>            A sense of self worth is something immutable.I wonder what modicum of the population has the idea that 'worth may have nothing to do with life'. "People" who live do live with the idea of 'self worth', the whole 100% of them. Of course, the measure of 'worth' in them varies. The sense of self worth may be a mental hurdle but its a necessity.<br>              Thanks for extending the question. Have you really known the life of a monk? How many monks live the way you describe.Well, lets consider the very few who live that way, they are no better than nihilists(that doesn't mean nihilists are worse ). I would consider them 'not living' again. Its just that they live along with others who are also monks, that makes them seem less miserable than nihilists.Living alone or in a group I haven't realized their existence making much of a consistent difference. You live without the idea of self worth for sometime?? Indeed, for SOMETIME you can dissociate from yourself. I completely agree with that. Can you live your entire lifespan like that? opinions differ. I don't have any intention to convince people who don't share my idea. To the best of my knowledge, this is what I believe in. It could be the other way. I don't deny that.|`|bljEhh86aa	yes, as much as possible|`|YmtNel5haa	I live in the moment, but as I am living I am constantly working on striving to obtain more.<br>  you only live once.|`|gsTpQmGfaa	I live in calm as long as my surroundings are calm with me, I guess...<br>  Calmness on a global scale can be something to work towards I guess<br>  :-)|`|bp2kMAr7aa	I think everyone should have some sort of goals. Me, I would be worthless if I had no goal or direction.|`|cxDbdhELaa	I prefer to live in the moment.|`|tCvCoksFaa	I like to be happy with what i have and enjoy it, but to take opportunities to get better without loosing the things i care most about. But also never to forget the things i want to do in life and sometimes make sacrifices to get them, but also for me to accept that others make sacrifices for me so i should be greatful for all that i have :)|`|2IrBEY4Taa	I believe that you work towards a goal so that you can enjoy the fruits of your labor in a relaxing, calm environment and try and create that same environment for others. <br>  At this time I am relaxed and calm by helping my five-year-old grandson with his sight words.|`|uhr3QHkLaa	Working for a goal, because it allows you to always be active and alert, and when you finally reach that goal it's very rewarding.|`|b4aadea01a6f367b0812c512a44d4cb4aa	Some of us inhabit a passive body and others an active body or various degrees of each depending on the endocrine system of each individual.<br>  In other words we are basically different and so different degrees of passivity or activity feels best.<br>  <br>  I am what I am, cheers!

shVgCizBaa	In the 1930s, the Great Depression hit Atlanta. With the city government nearing bankruptcy, the Coca-Cola Company had to help bail out the city's deficit. The federal government stepped in to help Atlantans by establishing Techwood Homes, the nation's first federal housing project in 1935.<br>  <br>  On December 15, 1939 Atlanta hosted the premiere of Gone With the Wind, the movie based on Atlanta resident Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel. Stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, and Olivia de Haviland were in attendance. It was held at Loew's Grand Theatre, at Peachtree and Forsyth Streets, current site of the Georgia-Pacific building. An enormous crowd, numbering 300,000 people according to the Atlanta Constitution, filled the streets on this ice-cold night in Atlanta. A rousing ovation greeted a group Confederate veterans who were guests of honor. Noticeably present was a young Martin Luther King, Jr., who sang in a boys choir from his father's church, Ebenezer Baptist.[11]<br>  <br>  With the entry of the United States into World War II, soldiers from around the Southeastern United States went through Atlanta to train and later be discharged at Fort McPherson. War-related manufacturing such as the Bell Aircraft factory in the suburb of Marietta helped boost the city's population and economy. Shortly after the war in 1946, the Communicable Disease Center, later called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was founded in Atlanta from the old Malaria Control in War Areas offices and staff.<br>  <br>  In 1951, the city received the All-America City Award, due to its rapid growth and high standard of living in the southern U.S.<br>  <br>  In the wake of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education, which helped usher in the Civil Rights Movement, racial tensions in Atlanta erupted in acts of violence. For example, on October 12, 1958, a Reform Jewish temple on Peachtree Street was bombed. The "Confederate Underground" claimed responsibility. Many believed that Jews, especially those from the northeast, were advocates of the Civil Rights Movement.<br>  <br>   <br>  Atlanta's Inman Park neighborhood was the city's first planned suburb. Today, it features several mansions and many colorful bungalows that are beautifully restored.In the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the US Civil Rights Movement, with Dr. Martin Luther King and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement's leadership. On October 19, 1960, a sit-in at the lunch counters of several Atlanta department stores led to the arrest of Dr. King and several students. This drew attention from the national media and from presidential candidate John F. Kennedy.<br>  <br>  Despite this incident, Atlanta's political and business leaders fostered Atlanta's image as "the city too busy to hate". In 1961, Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of Atlanta's public schools. While the city mostly avoided confrontation, minor race riots did occur in 1965 and in 1968.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Atlanta" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a>

Here are a few reasons<br>  -He isn't all powerful or perfect<br>  -He never quite fits an archetype<br>  -He depends on others just as much as he works to get things done<br>  -His biggest strength can be argued as friendship not magic <br>  -He makes errors that effects the plot (end of book 5 is a prime example)<br>  -He has a range of emotions and not all show him is a positive light (jealousy, envy, unjustified anger, etc.)<br>  -He is believable as a character<br>  <br>  additional note:<br>  I agree that he does borderline a Gary/Marty at times; however he never quites get there.  While the plot of the book is a bit cliched, Rowling's biggest strengths are in the characters and the world she created.|`|FNwYzjogaa	I would say he is close but he is well written enough that it doesn't seem like it. He has enough believable flaws that make him less perfect and less Mary Sue. The whole book Harry Potter is cliche but Rowling did such a great job of writing it that you really don't notice.|`|wKSvnna2aa	Not really. He actually seems human. I'm similar to him in personality: I talked back to adults, I got irritated easily, I felt weak and helpless, I missed my grandmother who died just like his parents died, I didn't like to do my homework, etc. (He is never the most powerful either, and makes mistakes.)<br>  <br>  Whereas I think the anime character Sailor Moon is the ultimate Mary Sue (her only flaws are being "clumsy" and "pigging out" on junk food...).|`|GWQXdw2qaa	Yes. Test him out: its fun!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://katfeete.net/writing/marysue.html" rel="nofollow">http://katfeete.net/writing/marysue.html</a><br>  Ex: <br>  <br>  - he always has witty comebacks etc.<br>  - He has a very striking scar, birthmark, tattoo, or other marking.<br>   -He is notably witty, always ready with a sharp comeback or clever remark. Alternatively, he is fascinatingly stern and close-mouthed.<br>  - There are many more.  Try it out!|`|kJjLwFzTaa	No not really....he's the main character yes but he has a lot of flaws in a way too.<br>  Just my opinion ;]|`|fI4LqMVMaa	I would say that Harry Potter was not a Gary Stu.  Based on the questions of a Mary Sue Litmus test (to test if in fact a character is a mary sue/gary stu) the characteristics do not match up to harry potter:<br>  <br>    Is the character named after you (this includes your first, middle, and last names, and any nicknames or online names you use)? <br>  NO<br>  <br>   Is the character's name an unusual spelling of a more common word or name? <br>  NO<br>   Is the character's name a noun or adjective not normally used as a name? <br>  NO<br>   Does the character's name contain unnecessary hyphens, apostrophes, or other punctuation? (e.g. M'chelle, Gloria-Angelica, etc.) <br>  NO<br>   Does the character have more than one first, middle, or last name, without reason? <br>  NO<br>   Does the character have a name you really, really like? <br>               Is it Raven? <br>               Is it a variation of Raven? <br>               Is it Hunter? <br>  NO<br>   Does the character's name describe her/his personality? (e.g. Tristan means sad, Darcy means dark, Charity means charity, etc.) <br>  NOT REALLY.  HARRY MEANS ARMY RULER, WHICH ISN"T HIS PERSONALITY<br>   Is the character's name just generally unusual in relation to the time or place where she/he lives or grew up? <br>  NO, COMMON BRITISH NAME<br>   Does the character have a nickname or pseudonym?<br>               Is it a "dangerous" nickname (e.g. Death Dealer, Crimson Fury, etc.)? <br>  THE BOY WHO LIVED...NOT EXACTLY 'DANGEROUS'<br>  <br>   Is the character's name foreign, even though the character isn't?<br>               Is it an Asian name? <br>  NO<br>   Does the character have a name or nickname that corresponds to a mythological/literary/historical/etc. figure (e.g. Venus, Faustus, Bonaparte)? <br>  NO<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Appearance <br>   Does your (mortal) character appear to be much younger than she/he really is? <br>  NO<br>   Does your (immortal) character appear to be much younger than she/he really is?  <br>  NA<br>   Is the character highly attractive without having to work at it? <br>  NO<br>   Is the character highly attractive only through her/his concerted effort? <br>  NO<br>   Are one or more other characters attracted to her/him? <br>       NO        Even though they are involved with someone else? <br>            NO   In defiance of sexual orientation? <br>  <br>   Is an otherwise chaste or stoic character immediately attracted to her/him? <br>  NO<br>   Does the character have an unusual eye color, or otherwise exceptional eyes? GREEN...IS THAT CONSIDERED UNUSUAL? <br>               And are these eyes a color that does not occur in nature? NO<br>               And will they have something to do with the plot? NOT HUGELY, JUST HIS MOTHERS EYES<br>  <br>   Does the character have eyes that somehow reflect hidden depths or experience or sorrow? <br>  NOT THAT I KNOW OF<br>   Does the character have an appearance unsuited to the time or place (e.g. perfect hair prior to the invention of shampoo, a woman wearing pants in 1805, etc.)? <br>  NO<br>   Does the character get a disproportionate amount of physical description compared to the rest of the characters? <br>  NO<br>   Does the character have unusual or exceptional hair, or does her/his hair get a disproportionate amount of description compared to that of the other characters? <br>  NO<br>   Is the character a fashion plate (this applies to any style of dress, from preppie to goth to Western to Elvish, and so on)? <br>  NO<br>   Does the character dress in a manner you find particularly attractive, sexy, or cool? <br>       NO, WEARA WHAT EVERYONE ELSE WEARS-ROBES        Even though it's illogical for the character to dress this way (for monetary reasons, or because it interferes with her/his job)? <br>  NO<br>   Is the character ever described as "thin enough to be anorexic," where this is intended as a compliment? <br>  NO<br>    Is the character is over 20 and appears much older than she/he really is? <br>  NO<br>    Is the character is overweight for the full duration of the story? ("Buxom" does not count.) <br>  NO<br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Character <br>  <br>   Does the character have a clone or identical twin? <br>              Are there a large number of clones in your story, and your character is neither the original nor above average in prowess?<br>     NO NA<br>   Is the character of above average intelligence? <br>               Is she/he a genius? <br>  NO, HAS CLASSES (POTIONS, DIVINATION) IN WHICH HE STRUGGLES<br>   Is the character related to royalty or nobility? <br>  NO<br>   Is the character rich or well-to-do, although she/he doesn't work? <br>  WELL, HAS MONEY IN GRINGOTTS<br>   Is the character heir to a large fortune? WELL, HE DOES HAVE MONEY IN GRINGOTTS<br>              The sole heir? NA<br>  <br>   Is the character the last surviving member of a family/clan/race/species/etc.? <br>  NO, THERE IS SIRIUS BLACK UNTIL BOOK FIVE<br>   Was the character ever the sole survivor of a calamity? <br>  YES...<br>   Was the character ever estranged from her/his family/tribe/country/etc.? <br>  SORT OF...JUST  AUNT AND UNCLE<br>   Was the character ever forcibly banished from<br>  <br>  <br>  Here was the result:<br>  Your Mary Sue Score: 33<br>   <br>  0-10 points: The Anti-Sue. Your character is the very antithesis of a Mary-Sue. Why are you even taking this test? <br>  <br>   11-20 points: The Non-Sue. Your character is a well-developed, balanced person, and is almost certainly not a Mary Sue. Congratulations! <br>  <br>  21-35 points: Borderline-Sue. Your character is cutting it close, and you may want to work on the details a bit, but you're well on your way to having a lovely original character. Good work. <br>  <br>   36-55 points: Mary-Sue. Your character needs some work in order to be believable. But despair not; you should still be able to salvage her with a little effort. Don't give up. <br>  <br>  56-70 points: über-Sue. You've got one hell of a Mary-Sue on your hands here, and it's not going to be easy to set things right. But do your best. There may be hope for you yet. <br>  <br>  71 points or more: Irredeemable-Sue. You're going to have to start over, my friend. I know you want to keep writing, but no. Just no. <br>   <br>  Again, keep in mind that the test isn't always correct. Morpheus from the Sandman Comics scored nearly 70 points, and yet we don't believe he's a Mary-Sue. He's well developed, suffers the consequences of several major personality flaws, and has very few powers or talents besides those necessary to perform the duties of his station. Of course, research, an interesting story, and good writing always help too. ;) <br>  <br>   <br>  He is borderline according to this test, but he has realistic flaws which get him in trouble, is well devloped and has a nice character arc, and has things that he isn't good at/can't do well.  Overall, I do not think he is a Gary Stu
zN6CJ3tzaa	The tortillion and paper stump are usually used for shading purposes, mainly because it's important not to get the oil of your hands on the paper. The sandpaper block is used for sharpening pastels or conte crayons.<br>  <br>  HB pencils are the hardest of your leads. 2B, 4B, and 6B are grades of softer lead pencils -- 6B being the softest. The different grades help you contour and shape your sketch.<br>  <br>  Toy with sketching -- example, a ball. Play with shading the ball, choosing a point of light and then contouring it to look round like a ball. Shading the ball will give it depth and allow it to look more 3D.<br>  <br>  Once you have become comfortable with your new tools, then you'll be able to begin working on your assignment.

This transports us smoother to your Hospital room.<br>  So far so good!|`|nCLcdJO0aa	I agree that it's a little rushed. Take some time at the start to describe your surroundings, use the 5 senses.<br>  <br>  And no one would be that perky and awake after being in hospital for a long period of time (tell the reader how long your character was in the hospital for. It will give the reader a better idea of the storyline so far.)<br>  <br>  Also, you should say 'unanswered questions' rather than 'unanswered thoughts'. I'd say 'strands of hair' instead of 'locks of hair', too.|`|GW2i2qqUaa	Read rilke's letters to a young poet. Please read this you will learn everything you need to learn about writing.

They do always raise moral and ethical questions like the one that I just finished by her called "Nineteen Minutes."  It's a difficult subject because it deals with a high school shooting, and it raises questions about student behavior and bullying.  Another one that I read by her is called "Change of Heart" which deals with the death penalty and organ donation.  Again, it's a complex subject matter and raises questions about morals and ethics.  I've read a bunch of Picoult's books but not sure if there is anyone similar to her.

KHSOVxViaa	The original meaning of republic is thing of the people, originally "res publicae" in Latin.<br>  <br>  the first so-named republic was ancient Rome, when it threw off its autocratic king Tarquin and developed a government with more public accountability.<br>  <br>  The meaning is not fixed, but it generally is intended to mean a government which is 'owned' or accountable to the people, as distinct from an unaccountable king or chief.<br>  <br>  In the modern world it has become just a name.  As well as many genuinely democratic republics, the world also contains a number of monarchies that are just as democratic and accountable; the monarch has become a figurehead.<br>  <br>  Conversely some modern republics are dictatorships or have autocratic leaders.  Often countries called "People's Republic" or "Democratic Republic" are exactly the opposite, where the people have no chance to choose or remove their government.  Some republics have "presidents for life", and have dynasties where the new president is the old president's son.<br>  <br>  So, these days, the term "republic" is just a name and says nothing about the actual government.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	Republic (government) (Latin res publica, literally “the public thing”), form of state based on the concept that sovereignty resides in the people, who delegate the power to rule in their behalf to elected representatives and officials. In practice, however, this concept has been variously stretched, distorted, and corrupted, making any precise definition of the term republic difficult. It is important, to begin with, to distinguish between a republic and a democracy. In the theoretical republican state, where the government expresses the will of the people who have chosen it, republic and democracy may be identical (there are also democratic monarchies). Historical republics, however, have never conformed to a theoretical model, and beginning in the 20th century the term republic was freely used by dictatorships, one-party states, and democracies alike. Republic has, in fact, come to signify any form of state headed by a president or some similarly titled figure, and not a monarch (see Monarchy).|`|shVgCizBaa	After the only British experience of a republic, the Commonwealth of 1649-60, republicanism did not have its own party. Nevertheless, republican sentiment was common among British radicals in the late 18th and 19th cents. Supporters of the American and French revolutions and admirers of Thomas Paine were usually republicans, as also were the plebeian radicals of the 1820s and 1830s, notably the followers of Richard Carlile, who published the Republican from 1819 to 1826. Some chartists were openly republican, as witness two late chartist journals, C. G. Harding's Republican (1848) and W. J. Linton's English Republic (1851-5). Periods of monarchical unpopularity stimulated republicanism. This was so during the Regency and again in the late 1860s and early 1870s, when a group of Liberal MPs, including Sir Charles Dilke and Joseph Chamberlain, revived there publican cause, fuelled by Queen Victoria's withdrawal from public life. At the same time popular republicanism was spread by Charles Bradlaugh and the secularist movement; and a short-lived journal, the Republican, appeared in 1870. The labour and socialist movements of the 1880s and 1890s were republican in principle. But republicanism was only one of the constituents and not a major part of the programme.<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/republican" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/republican</a>   ------------------ The Republican Form of government is one in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to whom those powers are specially delegated. Unlike the democratic form of government, in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the whole body of free citizens, individuals retain sovereign prerogatives over their private property rights (absolute ownership) of their person, labor and property. <br>  <br>  The U.S. Constitution guarantees a republican form to the states.<br>   Basic concept <br>  The Republican form is based on the foundation that people are supreme, and governments are instituted to help secure their rights to life, liberty and property. Examples of sovereign prerogatives are the right to defend private property with deadly force, right of locomotion (freedom to travel) upon public roads and waterways, and free exercise of rights and powers. <br>  <br>  Philosophical foundations <br>  Some draw from the Judeo-Christian philosophy that God granted dominion (absolute ownership) over the earth to man (see Genesis 1:26), thus sovereignty follows. Since absolute ownership cannot be exercised collectively, individual sovereignty is inherent in the endowment. Each man absolutely owns himself, his labor and fruits of his labor, as well as the land he acquires. This parallels the legal definition for private property, that which is absolutely owned by an individual.  <br>  Common misconceptions <br>  It is a common error to assume that a republic is synonymous with a republican form of government. Many are misled to assume that the republican form is merely a populist democracy limited by constitution. In fact, exercising political liberty (voting and holding office) requires one to step down in status, changing from the republican form to the democratic form. American citizens are assumed to have voluntarily accepted obligations and duties associated with democracy that are inapplicable to the people at large. For example, conscription, if compulsory, would be a violation of liberty and life. However, in American law, sovereign people are not subjects to or objects of such impositions - only citizens are obligated. <br>  <br>  Another misconception is that elected officials in the legislature are representatives for the people at large. In fact, they can only represent constituents, i.e., citizens / voters who gave consent, thus power of attorney to bind them to obedience. In a republican form, the individual's delegated representative who exercises power on his behalf, in defense of his life, liberty or property rights is not the legislature but the appropriate executive officer. A sheriff, if within a county, is his representative. Or an ambassador is his representative, if within a foreign nation. <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Republican_form_of_government" rel="nofollow">http://www.conservapedia.com/Republican_...</a>

K2h6M1xqaa	Hey!  You've got some skill.  That's not common around these parts wrt writing.  I usually tense up when reading people's stuff in anticipation of a stomach blow.  Usually this is a wise move.  Not so here.  How refreshing!<br>  <br>  There are, however, a couple of basic points worth mentioning. . .<br>  <br>  1. I'd use more sentence and paragraph breaks.  If you can't indent, then insert an empty line between paragraphs.  It makes things much easier on the eyes.  Endless blocks of gray text are murder, especially on computer screens!<br>  <br>  2. Believe it or not, you could benefit from using fewer adjectives.  It's common for new writers to over-describe things.  It looks like you're trying too hard, cramming too much into too little.  The old rule, (as I'm sure you've heard) is, "Show me, don't tell me."  or "Stimulus over Response".  Let the reader supply the adjectives about 20% more often.<br>  <br>  The nice thing, though, is that as you really start to dig into a project, the over-carefulness wears off quickly.  It's too much damned work!  You'll stop sounding like a generic fan-fic writer soon enough.<br>  <br>  So basically. . , add some line spaces and keep doing what you're doing.  You're way ahead of the pack, so all you really need to do is put in the work.<br>  <br>  Cheers, and thank-you for brightening things up around here!|`|oQrIn41zaa	I like it, very much.<br>  You should add some speech, I know it's probably different, but some speech may want the reader to get to know things more, maybe some names other than daisy, lol.

She reached out a hand toward him, but the vision was gone. Her eyes grew dark, and she knew she was losing consciousness. She tried to push herself off the ground, but her energy had vanished.

fI4LqMVMaa	"The Writer's Market" is the best resource I can suggest for an aspiring writer.<br>  <a href="http://www.writersmarket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersmarket.com/</a><br>  <br>  It can provide a lot of the resources that you will need and give you some guidance.<br>  <br>  Also, read Literary Marketplace (a thick book of literary agents). Look for those who specialize in your genre. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. Expect it to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. Thats just part of the business.<br>  <br>  In Order for your book to have a chance of publication:<br>  You’ll need to know how to write an effective ‘query letter’ to a literary agent. The letter will also include a synopsis of your book, preferably one that will hold the interest of the agent. The idea is to make him or her ask for the first couple of chapters of your work. Do not ever send a manuscript to a publisher or literary agent without sending your query letter first. <br>  <br>  You’ll also need to know how to format your manuscript. This includes the fonts (size and type) that most agents, editors, and publishers want. These are usually Courier New and Times New Roman (12 pt). Short stories and novels are formatted differently. You will need to follow submission guidelines just as they are laid down for your submissions. Anything less will result in your manuscript sent back or destroyed unread. <br>  <br>  One of the most important issues in manuscript submitting is the proper ‘page set up’ for your work. This includes margins, indents, and paragraphs. Most editors will want to see your manuscript double spaced. This allows the editor to use his/her proofreaders marks between the lines. Most margins will be one inch all around with a ragged right margin and an even left.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you decide to hire an editor, remember: Your manuscript will be double spaced, which means there will be twice as many pages. A 600 page novel could cost you around $1800.00, some even more depending on what the editor charges per page. Then there’s the hourly rate that some charge. Usually it’s within the range of $65.00. So, if they work on your book for 18 hours, that’s another $1170.00 + $1800.00 = $2970.00<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a side note, it’s a good idea to know some of the publishing laws. The use of names and places. <br>  <br>  These include<br>  o Delivery Of Satisfactory Copy <br>  o Permission for Copyrighted Material <br>  o Grant Of Rights <br>  o Proofreading and Author's Corrections <br>  o Advances and Royalties <br>  o Author's Warranties and Indemnities <br>  o Copies to Author <br>  o Option Clause<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  Additionally, you could self publish (this is called vanity press) but it is a more difficult and time consuming option.<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  As for help with writing, the main thing is to proofread and edit.  You are expected to write and rewrite and rewrite: that is just part of the process.  Friends and family can help with editing and provide helpful feedback about what works and what doesn't.  Listen to them, and consider what they say.  You need not use all of their suggestions, but it is worthwhile to at least consider what they have to say.<br>  <br>  If you should get stuck on a plot event, character, setting, etc, there are plenty of things you can do to get going again or get new ideas.  There are books and kits out there for would be writers, providing prompts and creative games to get the ideas flowing and help with things like "Character development, dialog, better endings, how to spot unnecessary lines/sentences/adverbs/etc."  Also, here are some links that might help you with whatever you're struggling with:<br>  <br>  Here's a story generator:<br>  <a href="http://shortstoryideas.herb.me.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://shortstoryideas.herb.me.uk/</a><br>  <br>  Here are some ways to stimulate those creative juices:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Creative" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Creative</a><br>  <br>  Here are some writing prompts:<br>  <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/WritingPrompts/" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersdigest.com/WritingProm...</a><br>  <br>  Here are some writing games:<br>  <a href="http://languageisavirus.com/" rel="nofollow">http://languageisavirus.com/</a><br>  <br>  Finally, if you are still stuck, here is one more link that you may find helpful:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://seventhsanctum.com/" rel="nofollow">http://seventhsanctum.com/</a> is the best site for breaking writer's block. There are tons of generators for plots, characters, alien races, gadgets... etc etc. And if nothing there floats your boat, the sidebar has links to other great generator sites.<br>  <br>  Worst comes to worst, join a writing group or take a creative writing class in order to recieve suggestions/guidance on your work.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I sincerely hope I helped!<br>  ~Clarkie|`|WTXvmcxcaa	There isn't really an answer to that. There are so many things you could do, that any of them would work. <br>  <br>  What I do is write until I finish, then go back and see if it is any good. If you spend all your time editing, it will never get done. Trust me. I use to edit and re-edit everything all the time, and I never got that far with anything. So, keep going and finish! <br>  <br>  Ok, so you want to publish? But no idea how to do it? Just look for someone who likes your idea. An English teacher could probably help you edit and publish it. Who knows? It just might work.|`|KrWSgCORaa	Go to wikihow and type "How to write a book", it should give you all the information you need. Characters should be based on people you know.<br>  <br>  As for the scam, you need to write(not email) a query letter to an agent(best place WMA), the agent will mail you back if you got his/her attention. Then they'll want your manuscript, they don't charge you, all they get is some royalties from your book sales.<br>  <br>  Agents contact publishers and try to get them to sell your book.

shVgCizBaa	The Museum of the Cherokee Indian is an official interpretive site for the National Park Service "Trail of Tears National Historic Trail," authorized by Congress in 1987. The Trail covers more than 2,200 miles of land and water routes in nine states.<br>  <br>  This national long-distance trail commemorates the "Trail of Tears", regarded as the most significant event in Cherokee history. Between June and December 1838, more than 15,000 Cherokees were forced to depart their homes in the southern Appalachians and walk more than a thousand miles to Indian Territory. Between 4,000 and 8,000 Cherokees died on "Nunahi-duna-dlo-hilu-i", the Trail Where They Cried."We, the great mass of the people, think only of the love we have for our land. For we do love the land where we were brought up. We will never let our hold to this land go. To let it go will be like throwing away our mother that gave us birth." <br>                 --Letter from Aitooweyah to John Ross, Principal Chief.<br>  <a href="http://www.cherokeemuseum.org/html/collections_tot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cherokeemuseum.org/html/colle...</a> What is the Trail of Tears?The Trail of Tears refers to the US government enforced relocation of the Cherokee Native Americans from their native lands in Georgia to Tahlequah, Oklahoma. This march was a devastating and deadly one for the Cherokee Nation--over 4000 deaths occurred during the march and afterwards in Oklahoma. Roughly 20% of the Cherokee Nation died either during the march, or shortly afterwards due to diseases like dysentery.<br>  <br>  To the Cherokee Nation, the Trail of Tears is called the Nunna daul Isunyi, or the Trail where We Cried. The march was exceptionally difficult, spanning over 1000 miles (about 1600 km). At least 2000 people died on the Trail of Tears, so cause for weeping is not hard to understand.<br>  <br>  The issues that determined this devastating decision by the US government started long before 1838, when Cherokees were forced to set foot on the Trail of Tears. Expansion and land treaties in the areas surrounding Georgia in the 1800s resulted in the Compact of 1802. Part of this compact was an agreement to relocate Native American populations living on lands defined as Georgia.<br>  <br>  The Cherokee Indians, who declared themselves in 1827 to be a distinct nation, protested this relocation decision. Several lawsuits went before the US Supreme Court contesting the right of the US government to forcibly relocate members of the Cherokee Nation. Further not all were in support of the actions that led to the Trail of Tears. In particular, Davy Crockett and writer Ralph Waldo Emerson contested the actions taken by the US government, and either spoke or wrote impassioned appeals on behalf of the Cherokees.<br>  <br>  The treaty that was ratified by the US government, ostensibly giving up claim to any lands east of the Mississippi by the Cherokees, was not signed by any Cherokee leaders. However, Presidential support first by Andrew Jackson and then Martin Van Buren was for the forced relocation. Thus in 1838, at gunpoint, Cherokee people were removed from their homes and set off to march on the Trail of Tears.<br>  <br>  Most of the Cherokee Nation, about 17,000 people, were forced to march on the Trail of Tears, and much of the relocation was actually conducted and supervised by Cherokee leaders. It should be noted that the Cherokee group was extremely westernized as compared to some of the other Native American groups. They lived in villages, made use of the American political system, and wealthy Cherokee people might own slaves. In fact, 2000 slaves also marched on the Trail of Tears with their Cherokee owners.<br>  <br>  About 1000 Cherokee people were exempt from the enforced march because they lived on lands already owned by people who opposed the march. Also, about 400 Cherokee people in North Carolina also evaded the Trail of Tears. Yet most in the Cherokee Nation endured the indignities and the suffering of this forced march.<br>  <br>  Perhaps because of the Cherokee’s strength as a nation, and ability to work with the US government, the Cherokee Nation recovered from their devastating losses and has remained one of the largest groups of Native American people in modern days. Efforts have been made in the past to commemorate and compensate for the intense suffering inflicted on the Cherokee Nation by the US government.<br>  <br>  A 2000 mile (3218.69 km) trail called the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail was dedicated in 1987. The trail crosses through nine states and serves as a reminder of the injustices committed by the US government toward the first Americans. <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-trail-of-tears.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-trai...</a>

EFjrJmdXaa	If a person strives for knowledge and wisdom for the sake of being better than others then they are just arrogant in general. In actuality knowledge and wisdom don't make a person arrogant, a person is already arrogant before they strive for knowledge and wisdom. Arrogance can root from a bitterness or feeling of contempt for others. Most often people try to make themselves look better than others because they have contempt for them. In some cases people can be confused for being arrogant when they really aren't. For example, one person can get upset with a person because of their lack of ethical behavior, and another person can get upset with a person for their lack of ethical behavior then boast about themselves and their own accomplishments. Even though they both seem to be unsettled only one of them is arrogant. Sometimes we can mistake a person for being arrogant when they just are upset with a situation. Just because a person is upset though doesn't mean they think they are better than the other person. To think you are better than another person you have to actually 'think' that. The thought that you are better than others has to enter your mind. So basically arrogance doesn't come from knowledge and wisdom. The capacity for arrogance is either there or not in the individual already. You'd think that knowledge and wisdom would tell us that arrogance is foolish because no one is perfect. Even if a few of us were perfect it wouldn't do any good because it takes more than a few people to have a positive impact on the world. And going around trying to explain that you are perfect is just going to turn people off.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Use the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

You can tell what someone is doing and feeling even if they are far away and behind glass. You have two pieces of fruit, and even if they feel, smell and taste the same, they aren't because this thing that's both a particle and a wave is absorbed by one of them differently.

I really want to see how it turns out! :) <br>  <br>  I just have a few suggestions. The first is the whole mom thing. Why did she have to kill herself? How about she died from some sort of cancer? Or drug overdose? I think suicide is WAY too harsh. <br>  <br>  Second, I think Julie and this girl's dad shouldn't be married yet. I think that maybe they should be dating, and then later in the story, Dad tells her that they are getting married. Make her angry. Make her say something like, "How could you just forget about Mom?"  <br>  <br>  The last thing is have the name of the main character show up more. like, when they get to the school. You could have Dad say, "Well, _____, there it is." And, the girl says, "It's great dad." Don't have her use his first name. I think that is too much like Twilight. <br>  <br>  Well, good luck writing. I love it so far! It really is great. I hope I see it on my shelves some day.|`|HsrCk2J1aa	its ok.

I just love Mr Darcy and find the book incredibly romantic.<br>  <br>  the way the end the film sense and s. is likewise incredibly romantic, but the difference between the negativity in P and P and S and S is <br>  <br>  Lydia is such an idiot that you can't even care about what happens to her and Wickham likewise. Mr Collins is the funniest *** I ever heard of. <br>  <br>  On the other hand in  sense and s the willowby character is disgusting. like a lot of players of our time. to me the negativity is a lot darker, after all the young ms nearly loses her life after she realizes that mr w is going to marry that other woman.<br>  <br>  have you read persuasion yet or seen the film. it is quite good also. I didn't like emma as much but it is still good entertainment|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I'd have to say those are my two least favourite Austen books.

I think both storylines are great. And all the characters are amazing in both books.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	I prefer Pride & Prejudice over Sense & Sensibility..... but both are great books....I think my favorite though is Mansfield Park.|`|9rekPBIdaa	Pride and Prejudice|`|mHWw4BX1aa	Pride and Prejudice all the way! best book iv ever read|`|qSc4WioLaa	I think they cater to different audiences.  (Personally, I like Pride and Prejudice much better.) Sense and Sensibility is slightly darker than Pride and Prejudice.  <br>  P&P is funny, romantic, and the characters are fantastic.  If you want to watch the movie version also, I would advise watching the BBC version of P&P with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.

ygDC4JFYaa	c acting is definitely a natural talent <br>  but that doesn mean u c cannot act . some people work hard to act and also they do not do all types of acting properly<br>  <br>  this can be understood as people say some are exemplary actors ae those who act naturally .|`|31e3aeeef48254ed515aa846df344c44aa	Acting is an art, and like any art, you need natural talent to do it better than anyone else -- among other things.  Actors can be "trained," but not in the same way that rats or school bus drivers are "trained" -- you don't go in the Entrance of an acting school and come out the Exit as an actor.  <br>  <br>  You learn your art (or your craft -- in this, the words mean nearly the same thing) but it might be a waste of your time and energy if you don't have the natural inclination for it (and desire ain't enough).  <br>  <br>  You might be a competent actor mechanically -- think Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing -- but without that "divine spark," you'll never be a really GREAT actor (think Robert DeNiro in ... ANYTHING).|`|l5BxN4eeaa	Acting is an art and as an art it requires talent, just like other kinds of art. People who just work hard and are confident, but can't draw to save their lives, aren't going to be put in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and rightfully so.

zN6CJ3tzaa	Of course you can! Life drawing classes are always looking for great models of all shapes and sizes. Practice your poses though, because it will help you get more assignments. Learn to keep poses for extended lengths of time, because you aren't going to be able to move about much. Also, learn to take direction from the instructor, because that will also aid you in getting more assignments -- if you understand the pose that the instructor wants you to strike, he/she won't have to spend valuable classtime trying to explain what he/she wants the pose to reflect. Just contact the school and inquire about such assignments and I'm sure you'll find something.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	From my experience, they welcome anyone.

pI5jKfmaaa	When we think of Thomas Jefferson, we remember him as President Jefferson and think of the many great accomplishments he had while he was leading our young country. Some of his other accomplishments are just as important yet not as easily remembered. Such things that may fall into this category are his views and influence on the educational system and the importance of the right and freedom to an education. <br>  <br>  Jefferson was born in Albemarle County, Virginia on April 13, 1743. He emerged as one of the great revolutionary leaders of our country. At the Second Continental Congress in June of 1776, he headed a committee of five that created the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson was the primary author of this document. After this, he returned to Virginia and served in the House of Delegates as part of the General Assembly of Virginia. While in the Assembly, he introduced a bill that would have created a free system of tax-supported elementary education for all except slaves. This bill was defeated along with another bill he enacted that would have created a public library and updated the curriculum of the College of William and Mary. Among the revisions were these topics: ethics, law, history, natural science, and ancient languages. He wanted to give the school a more modern and bold approach to education that had not been known until then. <br>  <br>  He was a great political leader but his greatest accomplishment in the field of education took place after his political career was finished. After his presidency, the last years of his life were spent creating the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. This school was to be a visionary new school that was to introduce America's youth to the new ideas about government and equality. He realized that different students have different academic needs and allowed for these differences by electives in his curriculum. Jefferson designed every aspect of this University. It was created as a place where both students and faculty would be able to enjoy the freedom and the ability to learn. He not only had the idea for this university, he surveyed the site, planned the buildings and was a supervisor during the construction process. Thanks to his efforts and determination, the university opened in March of 1825. <br>  <br>  Jefferson helped push education ahead and allowed for a strong foundation for future universities and colleges. Jefferson's will and drive were there to protect the "unlimitable freedom of the human mind to explore and to expose every subject susceptible of its contemplation." If it were not for Thomas Jefferson, the educational system as we know it might not exist today. For this I think we owe him our eternal gratitude.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Thomas Jefferson was the primary author in drafting the American declaration of Independence. The act was adopted on July 4th 1776 and was a symbolic statement of the aims of the American Revolution. Jefferson received suggestions from others such as James Maddison. He was also influenced by the writings of the British Empiricists, in particular, Johnathon Lock and Thomas Paine. <br>  I have listed a web site for you to check into the bio of Thomas Jefferson hope it helps.

JEcYgXGtaa	Bella doesnt love Jacob she just likes them.  Its a different love that she has for Edward though.  She cant live without Edward or Jacob but she really really cant live without Edward. She does choose her true love Edward in Breaking Dawn.  SHe just kinda liked Jacob.  She didnt love love him.  More just like a love that she knew would never happen because they werent rite for each other.|`|3reHk4I1aa	ok well she loved him because he made her feel like she was whole again and she described him as natural (like it was like the sun it was always there) but she loves edward because she needs him (he is like a drug to her) and the thing is is that jacob is healthy like breathing and edwad is something  different. but she will always love edward because she needs him. i hate jacob too.|`|iXNcB0vSaa	Bella doesnt love him<br>  well yea but more like a friend or a brother<br>  she still loves edward more because his her soulmate|`|LXWWbZNAaa	she doesn't like him but he is more of an older brother that she never had and he always makes her happy|`|11Zxe7J5aa	Bella does love Jacob, but not as much as Edward. Edward is her soul mate and she doesn't leave him. She loves jacob as a brother but she also falls in love with him because he helped through a really rough time when Edward left her. She needed him to survive and that will always be there, Edward or no Edward.|`|fkTb2TiYaa	she loves jacob like family cuz he was there when edward left her and she became close, but she's still in love with edward. in breaking dawn bella says that she loves jacob, but shes not in love with him like she is with edward|`|kJjLwFzTaa	No she doesn't like Jacob as more than just a friend.<br>  In the end she's going to pick Edward.|`|yhQ3LT4haa	Bella said to me that she loved Jacob because he helped her heal the pain that Edward leaving did to her. She loved Edward way more than Jacob, there soul mates!<br>  <br>  - Mary Alice Brandon Cullen hale<br>  Big Name!|`|8QKgkOZfaa	Its more of lust, really, if you think about it. Bella's bond with Jacob runs very deep, and its more of a brother and sister love to her. At one point, she may have thought that it was more than so, but after considering her relationship with Edward she chose Edward's love over Jacob's. I'm not sure how much more I can add to that, and I don't want to add spoilers just to add. I got yelled at because I wasn't careful :)<br>  <br>  Its mostly Jacob who has the want to be together.
jqQAxAaKaa	By about 1300, the forces of growth, expansion, revival, and renewal that had propelled western European society forward during the preceding three centuries showed signs of faltering. As a result, that society began to encounter stresses and tensions that laid bare the limitations inherent in the medieval pattern of civilisation, and which required adjustments in institutions and mentalities in order to cope with problems stemming from those limitations. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries thus became an age of transition marked by developments in political, economic, social, religious, intellectual, and artistic life which transformed the medieval order in significant ways. What emerged was the early modern European world, whose roots were in the medieval world but whose institutional and ideological configuration was sufficiently different to mark a turning point in the history of western European civilisation.<br>  The tensions that beset and transformed western European economic, social, and political structures during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were also felt in religious life. After 1300, the religious establishment, which had earlier decisively influenced all aspects of human activity, encountered increasing difficulties in asserting its traditional leadership role. Its leaders, its system of government, and its teachings were challenged on many fronts. From one perspective many of these challenges represented a continuation of the reforming spirit that had characterised religious life between 1000 and 1300. However, others stemmed from new forces unleashed by the troubled times marking the late medieval age of transition. Increasingly, the directive forces in the religious establishment failed to discover effective ways to respond to mounting challenges.|`|oo1bOj9caa	Time passed.<br>  The Middle ages did not decline, regimes or governments or religions did

AA11442722	Warlocks are good solid guitars for the price. I loved the way they look so got me a low end bronze expecting to have to change out the pickups and do heavy modifications but the stock Warlock turned out to be pretty decent. Even used it as a backup guitar at gigs, which means it saw stage time every once in a while. <br>  <br>  The necks are a bit different between a Squire and a Warlock but the Warlock necks are pretty beefy compared to Gibson necks so it's not as huge a transition as going to many other models. If your playing Metal I think you'll prefer the Warlock sound over the Squire sound. <br>  <br>  So I'd say go for it. It'd be a good step up from the Squire. You should also consider the Ephiphone lines. They make some good guitars for low costs.|`|E4jwk6r0aa	Personally i would play the hell out of the Squire for a year or two longer, there are a difference in necks and sounds shure but you are shooting for competency and consistancy of f<br>  ingering and voicing,<br>   In circles, the single coil p/u takes a bit more work right along with the actual playing of the strings, Dan Electros, same way, but one thing Ed Van Hailen proved the joke aint the sound I get out of one pickup with a sound guitar.<br>    It really is what you play and how you play it the double coil pop outs comming from everywhere are abundant, BC rich is a good choice for the buck but the squire can't be that bad, I would upgrade it, there are a **** load of parts that you  can get to turn the sucker into a full pledged Strat.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	i thought all beginners bought warlocks....<br>  <br>  at least in my area that's how it is...<br>  <br>  i am too much of a traditionalist - i would never own one.

cR8UZdi1aa	No, sorry I can't. It looks like it is a garden/plant vase (from the hole on the bottom) which means it could have been made by hundreds of different potters or casters. But with the stamp being partially cut out from this hole, it is possible that someone drilled the hole in the bottom after it was purchased. This would of course make it that much more difficult to identify. I'd suggest checking with the original owners (from who you got it from) even if it was bought at a garage sale, you can trace the steps back & possibly find more info. Or find out from the local potters or art guilds in the area that you originally got the piece from, maybe they could help you. Sorry, it's a nice piece though!

shVgCizBaa	What is the Palestinian Authority and how did it originate?<br>  The 1993 Israel-Palestinian Declaration of Principles (DOP) was the first in a series of steps known as the "Oslo Peace Process". The DOP set forth a two-phased timetable. The first phase, or the "interim period," was to last five years, during which time Israel would incrementally withdraw from Palestinian population centers in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza Strip, while transferring administrative power to an elected Palestinian Authority (PA).<br>  <br>  A transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO May 4, 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. As an immediate result of this agreement, Yasser Arafat was able to return from the PLO exile in Tunisia to take control. The event was chillingly described by eyewitness Michael Kelly in his article titled "Promises but Never Peace":<br>  <br>  Arafat's entry into Gaza was an object lesson: a purposely uncaring display of brute power. He arrived from the Sinai in a long caravan of Chevrolet Blazers and Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs, 70 or 80 cars packed to the rooflines with men with guns. The caravan roared up the thronged roads and down the mobbed streets, with the overfed, leather-jacketed, sunglassed thugs of Arafat's bodyguard detail all the time screaming and shooting off their Kalashnikovs to make their beloved people scurry out of their beloved leader's way.<br>  The transfer from Israel to the Palestinian Authority took place in additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO September 28, 1995 Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO January 15, 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO October 23, 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the September 4, 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement.<br>  <br>  After the interim period, the second phase was expected to be the "permanent status" or "final status" negotiations, to resolve "remaining issues, including: Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, security arrangements, borders, relations and cooperation with other neighbors, and other issues of common interest." A final status agreement would mark the official peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, including the possible establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state.<br>  <br>  The Palestinian Authority was given the responsibility for combating terrorism and coordinating security with Israel. Following the implementation of the Oslo agreements, the PA gained control over all of the Gaza Strip excluding Israeli settlements (over 85 percent of the area) and 39.7 percent of the territory of Judea and Samaria, the West Bank. The land areas were chosen so that ninety-nine percent of the Palestinian population resides under the Palestinian Authority's jurisdiction.<br>  <br>  On January 20, 1996 Palestinian Arabs elected an 88-member legislative council and a president of the Palestinian Authority. The date of the elections was more than 18 months later than planned, a delay used by Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yaser Arafat to consolidate his grip on the Palestinian populace and silence opposition. Any independent news sources were intimidated into silence and opposing political organizations quietly disappeared. Arafat manipulated the election with rules to forbid anyone from running against him without his express approval, as reported by the UN election observer team. Dr. Haider Abdul Shefi, who had led the PLO delegation at the Madrid negotiations in 1991, offered his candidacy, only to be rejected by Arafat. When Dr. Shefi said that he was going to run anyway, a bomb explosion in Dr. Shefi's home convinced him otherwise.<br>  <br>  When the votes were counted, Arafat became the Palestinian Authority's first president, winning 88.1 percent of the vote; his main opponent, Samiha Yusuf Khalil, garnered 9.3 percent. The legislative contests, held in 16 districts of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, saw 50 of the 88 seats go to members of the Arafat's Fatah political movement and most of the rest go to parties who were reliably loyal to Arafat. International monitors noted a number of irregularities, but praised the high turnout and the efficient manner in which the elections were conducted. However, investigations have since documented the methods Arafat used to impose dictatorial rule and ensure his landslide victory.<br>  <br>  Final status agreements between Israel and the PA have been delayed because the PA's commitment to Israel's security, embodied in a series of signed documents, has been only an illusion created to gain concessions. The years of the "Oslo Peace Process" have been filled with escalating violence and terrorism against Israel to the point where the time is known in Israel as the "Oslo War". The PA continues to wage the al-Aqsa intifada war of terrorism against Israel and the Oslo process seems to be dead.<br>  <a href="http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_now_pa_origin.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_...</a>    ---------------|`|3f9801db412802d171bc0f90d2415e10aa	it is a governing body of Palestinian territories of west bank and Gaza strip.

It could also be because red hair is very luminous when captured on canvas. Sorry, I know my answer is a bit vague too!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Simple.

z4Yeofq8aa	The rulers of Byzantium (Constantinople) claimed to be the legitimate heirs to the Roman dynasty. When it was conquered by the Turks the ruling Sultans used "Caesar of all the lands of Rome" as one of their titles. Ivan the terrible's claim through descent is pretty meaningless given that Roman emperors didn't always make their heirs the next emperor so even if he were a direct descendent it wouldn't give him any legitimate claim.|`|AA11969509	Ivan the Terrible was a descendant of the Byzantine emperors through a marriage of Ivan the III to a Byzantine princess.|`|shVgCizBaa	Ivan the Terrible<br>  Ivan IV Vasilyevich—better known as ‘Ivan The Terrible’—officially came to the Russian throne in 1533 as the Grand Duke of Moscow at the age of three. His parents died while he was young and the Russian nobility fought for the power they left unused. Ivan grew up afraid and alone with his bible, in constant fear of being murdered. This most probably fueled his obsession for suffering: he would tear off birds’ wings or throw cats and dogs from tall buildings. Ivan was an emotional wreck. -----------A golden age for Russia As Ivan grew older (and escaped murder) he came to believe God protected him. At the time, Russians believed orthodoxy was the true faith. Ivan saw Russia as the centre of Christianity and Russia’s ruler as it’s protector—hence the greatest ruler in the world. Therefore in 1547 Ivan crowned himself Czar of Russia, claiming sacred descendance from the Roman emperors. This ’sacred power’ placed him above the nobility. Ivan married Anastasia Romanov, who kept her husband’s cruelty remarkably well in check. Czar Ivan expanded the country, centralized power and reformed the government, the army, the economy and the church.<br>  <br>  But Russia’s golden age of development and expansion was disrupted by the death of Anastasia. Ivan, suspecting murder, went mad with grief. His old cruelty and sadism resurfaced as he took revenge on the Russian nobles by torturing entire families. Ivan reasoned: if God is so cruel as to take away my wife, than I should rule cruel as well. He established an absolute, unchallenged rule. His newly-created secret terror police, the Oprichniks, raped, murdered and plundered, while in their ‘monastry’s’ dungeons Ivan reconstructed hell on earth. Here people were cruelly tortured with religious justification. Peasant girls were raped in massive orgies and used for target practice by the Oprichniks.<br>  <br>  Ivan was merciless towards opposition. He murdered thousands of nobles and had the head of the Russian church murdered when he begged for mercy for the people. Upon hearing rumours of rebellion by the city of Novgorod Ivan practically had the whole city destroyed. More than 15,000 people were tortured—sometimes by the Czar himself. Ivan even linked the Novgorod rebellion to Moscow. He held massive executions at the red square, killing over 300 government and military officials in one day. For years Ivan the Terrible waged war on his own country.<br>  <br>  Consumption by guilt and paranoia<br>  In a heated argument Ivan accidentally killed his son and heir. Grief, guilt and paranoia slowly consumed Ivan from the inside. He was depressed, in constant physical pain and a broken man. In remorse he had lists drawn up of all the people he had executed. Ivan the Terrible would die at the age of 54, having destroyed himself, his dynasty and most of his country. Russia’s chances for survival were slim.<br>  <a href="http://pasttense.nl/2006/03/10/ivan-the-terrible/" rel="nofollow">http://pasttense.nl/2006/03/10/ivan-the-...</a>

This meant that all the great learning prior to their own culture was lost.

S01zIagOaa	It depends on the audition. For film roles or TV you are generally given material to prepare, usually called "Sides". If for theater a monologue may be required, or they may have you do a scene from the play they are casting for. When it comes to monologues however, you should ideally have more than one ready to go at any given time. One comedic, one dramatic, another somewhere in between perhaps, the point is there is really no such thing as too much preparation as an entertainer.|`|S7QnjI7eaa	what type of audition is it? like musical theatre, dance, acting?<br>  <br>  you should have a song and be able to talk about yourself, confidence and don't worry.

She is a little bit off of her rocker. Jilted on the day of her wedding (some 25 years before Pip’s first encounter with her), Miss Havisham has wanted to preserve this memory forevermore by stopping the clocks at the precise moment of the jilt-age. She looks like a ghost, and sometimes we think she might just be a ghost. She’s also an engineer, and has designed a powerful missile, named Estella. Miss Havisham likes to launch Estella into the stratosphere in order that she might wipe out the male sex (all of whom are responsible for her jilt-age, obviously). Miss Havisham is responsible for encouraging Pip’s obsession with Estella and for dangling the carrot of wealth and social class in front of his nose.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/character/literature/charles-dickens/great-expectations/miss-havisham.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...</a><br>  <br>  =================================<br>  <br>  If you need a more in depth character analysis, then look at this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eriding.net/amoore/prose/greatexpectations.htm#22" rel="nofollow">http://www.eriding.net/amoore/prose/grea...</a>|`|0WMpafVnaa	miss havisham is a woman who has been jilted at the altar many years ago by her lover, and has never got over her broken heart. she missed out on her wedding day and a 'normal life', and has worn the same wedding dress every day ever since the day of her proposed wedding. her one aim in life is to plot revenge on men to get them back for what her lover did to her.|`|zabgS2apaa	She is a bitter, eccentric old lady whose fiance abandoned her at twenty minutes to three in the afternoon before her wedding, she stops the clocks, shuts herself away in her big house still in her wedding dress and spends the rest of her life alone and bitter, hating men with a passion and wanting revenge on all the male sex.

Ow3O7h4caa	Wow<br>  <br>  i would think it would go flat if the neck was loose or the bridge of the guitar tends to lift. You didn't specify if it is an electric or an acoustic.<br>  <br>  If it is electric and has a tremolo, than the tremolo can be the problem. I have often seen whammy bars that got stuck when you lower raised it and it didn't go back to its original place.<br>  <br>  But for an acoustic. Maybe you are applying for pulling the neck towards your body while holding the guitar in place with the right which would bend the neck back a little under the pressure.<br>  Loosen up and don't apply pressure with the right hand or the left. That is the only think i can see. You can tighten the neck yourself with a screw driver unless it is a one-piece neck.|`|AA11442722	I think it has something to do with the combination of  tuning pegs, strings and weather. I've got a guitar that does the same. It's not as uncommon as Lefty implies. Normally strings go flat after playing but certain string brands with the right tuners will do the opposite and go sharp. I've seen it on several guitars over the years. It's been consistant on that guitar with that brand of string. If they were not going sharp they'd go flat. I wouldn't worry about it unless it's happening very quickly. If after 10 minutes of playing your strings are sharp, then something is going on. Potentially lots of string bending, which means you want to change brands of strings to something that stays in tune better. If your using an electric and have a whammy bar or a locking bridge that's something else to look at.

There is 2 ways of doing a cartwheel<br>  <br>  <br>  one is to run into it and enter the cartwheel as if you were doing a roundoff, and you should land facing the opposite way you went into the cartwheel<br>  <br>  The other is to stand with your hands in the air and your feet spread apart (like in the shape of a star) and turn yourself sideways onto your hands, and then go over into a cartwheel)<br>  <br>  B. Your legs should be as straight as possible for the cartwheel to look clean, but there is a varation which requires you to bend your legs completley (its used in martial arts)-you should try to keep your legs straight<br>  <br>  C. Your legs are probably sore from the impact and stress they get from doing cartwheels.

shVgCizBaa	What's the most important part of Gandhi's life?I think  it was the Non-cooperation movement,<br>   <br>  The Edwin Movement  was the first-ever series of nationwide people's movements of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience, led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. The Movement opened the Gandhi Era in the Indian Independence Movement and took place from September 1920 until February 1922 [1] [2].<br>  <br>  The Rowlatt Acts were legislation that imposed authoritarian restrictions upon Indian people. The notion of habeas corpus was discarded, and the police and army were empowered to search and seize property, and detain and arrest any Indian without the slightest need for evidence. Promulgated by the British Parliament, the Viceroy and the Imperial Legislative Council, they were to be enforced on April 6, 1919.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, many Indians were already infuriated by the British authorities' decision to send Indian soldiers to World War I without the slightest consultation with the Indian people in any manner or form.<br>  <br>  The calls of liberal and moderate political leaders like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Annie Besant, Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Bal Gangadhar Tilak for Home Rule were accompanied only by petitions and major public meetings. They never resulted in disorder or obstruction of government services.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_movement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coopera...</a><br>  Non-cooperation<br>  Gandhi employed non-cooperation, non-violence and peaceful resistance as his "weapons" in the struggle against British. In Punjab, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of civilians by British troops (also known as the Amritsar Massacre) caused deep trauma to the nation, leading to increased public anger and acts of violence. Gandhi criticized both the actions of the British Raj and the retaliatory violence of Indians. He authored the resolution offering condolences to British civilian victims and condemning the riots which, after initial opposition in the party, was accepted following Gandhi's emotional speech advocating his principle that all violence was evil and could not be justified.[9] But it was after the massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhi's mind focused upon obtaining complete self-government and control of all Indian government institutions, maturing soon into Swaraj or complete individual, spiritual, political independence.<br>  <br>   <br>  Sabarmati Ashram, Gandhi's home in GujaratIn December 1921, Gandhi was invested with executive authority on behalf of the Indian National Congress. Under his leadership, the Congress was reorganized with a new constitution, with the goal of Swaraj. Membership in the party was opened to anyone prepared to pay a token fee. A hierarchy of committees was set up to improve discipline, transforming the party from an elite organization to one of mass national appeal. Gandhi expanded his non-violence platform to include the swadeshi policy — the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi in support of the independence movement.[10] This was a strategy to inculcate discipline and dedication to weed out the unwilling and ambitious, and to include women in the movement at a time when many thought that such activities were not respectable activities for women. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British educational institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours.<br>  <br>  "Non-cooperation" enjoyed widespread appeal and success, increasing excitement and participation from all strata of Indian society. Yet, just as the movement reached its apex, it ended abruptly as a result of a violent clash in the town of Chauri Chaura, Uttar Pradesh, in February 1922. Fearing that the movement was about to take a turn towards violence, and convinced that this would be the undoing of all his work, Gandhi called off the campaign of mass civil disobedience.[11] Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. He was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only 2 years.<br>  <br>  Without Gandhi's uniting personality, the Indian National Congress began to splinter during his years in prison, splitting into two factions, one led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposing this move. Furthermore, cooperation among Hindus and Muslims, which had been strong at the height of the non-violence campaign, was breaking down. Gandhi attempted to bridge these differences through many means, including a three-week fast in the autumn of 1924, but with limited success <a href="http://en.wikipe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipe</a>|`|UMAZAju8aa	Just look at Mahatma Gandhi's belongings pis at <a href="http://www.unserkraft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.unserkraft.com</a>|`|VqcNXuC2aa	The hunger strike

zC8xLn8caa	Actually, your assumption seems to be that '~All~ people ~naturally~ like freedom'. How would you define 'freedom'?  I would take a more moderate approach, as some people do seem to like/require controls on their behaviour. Children, for example, arguably closer to nature than adults, NEED structure and controls to feel secure. Absolute freedom without rules can be frightening (in a chaotic anarchy, you might be attacked with impunity), but freedom within a familiar framework can be liberating (such as being able to peacefully demonstrate, and have your voice be heard).    <br>  <br>   As far as forced enslavement or control, we are social animals with an instinctive sense of hierarchy. Knowing you have no choice or chance to advance, feeling inferior, and seeing your opportunities reduced is something we are programmed to chafe against, I think. But you may also have noticed that in some cases, historically (think Bush post 9/11), people will choose what they percieve as a strong leader in times of uncertainty, even if it means accepting more restrictions on their freedom. I think psychologically, it's a fine balance between feeling constrained vs. feeling secure within the limits you have. <br>  <br>  And physically?  Same deal. Babies like the security of swaddling. But me? I'd pick boxers over briefs, skirts over jeans. Greater ease of motion means comfort.  :)|`|2scdUqkMaa	Well duh...try living as a slave even for one day then look at this question again|`|YmtNel5haa	Nothing is more difficult, and therefore more precious, than to be able to decide.  ~Napoleon Bonaparte|`|2z1h5mfOaa	Going through a difficult phase relating to this, I'd say that we feel (as adults anyway) quite capable and responsible to make decisions about what we do, how we live, what we think and feel etc.  When someone butts in telling you to do things this way or that, and deep within you you know it's not the best way for whatever reason, you resent being controllerd, being told what to do, being at the other end of "mindless authority" like bureaucracy etc.  <br>  At the same time, we are also supposed to have a moral sense, i.e, what is right and wrong.  This differs from culture to culture, which complicates things, but it can also be "warped" because of your experiences, and this may impact on your views of your freedom to do what you think is right for you.  <br>  Not an easy question, but an interesting one.|`|UtzALxfjaa	If man never yearned to be free, we would have never gotten anywhere.

Is Hitler just as horrible as the student who took a guy to school and destroyed other students, or a parent who kills his/her child or children, or someone who drives drunk and kills others, or someone who just hates and hates so much that he/she go out and kill anyone in his/her path?  I think killing is horrible.<br>  Sometimes mankind has to stay stop and uses whatever means they need in order to stop a person from killing. During world war II, the World had to stop Hitler and the Japanese.  Another example is when a police officer must shoot to defend oneself or defend others.<br>  <br>  There is a saying.<br>  There is a stone, and you either use the stone for good or you trip on in.  If you don't learn your lesson, you get a bigger stone in your path. If you still don't learn your lesson, you get a wall.<br>  If you still don't learn your lesson, you get a mountain.<br>  Then perhaps you learn to go around the obstacle, or turn it into something for good, or GOD sends another lesson.<br>  <br>  I have no answers.  I'm so glad you are questioning.  When you question, you awaken your light within yourself.<br>  When you are angry, you can face that something is making you choose to be angry, and then you get over it.  <br>  <br>  My personal lesson.<br>  I was so happy to be pregnant for the first time when I was 37.<br>  My daughter died because I did not get to the emergency room in time for her birth, and her complications.<br>  I believe now that the lesson is that I am more equal now.<br>  I am equal with all of the other parents who lose their sons & daughters in car accidents, drownings, wars, & physical problems like cancer.<br>  Yes, I believe I became more equal.<br>  We are more equal when we are first born.<br>  We become unequal as we grow "our hair changes color, and we develop differently".<br>  We age and become more equal, with "gray or white hair, wrinkles and creaky muscles & bones, and less caring about getting ahead in one's career.  We become more grateful as we age.<br>  <br>  The most important lesson that I can share is that you have a life of choices.  May you always be blessed with great choices and learn your lessons the easy way, and not the hard way.<br>  Make sure you learn from the stones in your path so they don't become walls or mountains as I described above this.<br>  <br>  GOD bless us always.<br>  MBA-Boston Univ.<br>  CPA-retired|`|EGU2MHSPaa	Not necessarily.  America is so screwed up today, things happen out of nowhere and have no justification.|`|dlGP3iZ6aa	It seems like you might be combining two different claims here 1) There might be some divine force with a "goal" in mind for the universe; 2) This divine "goal" should benefit humankind.<br>  <br>  The problem with the idea that everything happens for a reason is that there is absolutely no way to verify or falsify this claim.  How do you prove something does or doesn't happen for a reason? All we can do is point at the world and say "look!"--and that can be done from either side of the argument.<br>  <br>  In any case, *if* you think there is some divine force at work, it is entirely possible that this force neither has a benevolent goal, nor that it is looking out for our interests.  Perhaps no "thing" is being favored in fate's eyes.  Perhaps it's squirrels, or hippos.  Why humans? Or anything at all? There could indeed be a "reason" for everything, but that reason need not serve us--or the Jews, for that matter.<br>  <br>  It's a gloomy picture of fate, but it might indeed be the case.  I, for one, would vote for the non-existence of fate.  But, then again, it is impossible for me, or anyone, to prove anything regarding the matter.  If fate is indifferent to me, then there might as well be no fate at all.<br>  <br>  Cheers.

qgs155HNaa	Externally, Henry happened to have two young, vigorous and wily opponents,  Francis I of France and Emperor Charles V.  His use of Cardinal Wolsey in international diplomacy complicated matters, since Wolsey had his own view of English policy, and Wolsey was interested in the Papacy.  At the same time, the Renaissance was reaching England in full force (e.g. Erasmus) and Protestantism was making its first inroads.  Henry still, in those years, thought of war as the greatest adventure, where true knights proved their valor in armed combat, and where issues could be solved man to man.|`|96dc1425b945a3c9982c9f640d3d8b57aa	Henry VIII failed to fulfil his his ambitions during this time because he was initially negotiating terms of peace with Spain and France. This did not eventuate because of the following.<br>  He denounced his Catholic faith to become a Protestant, In return falling out with the Pope which lead to him loosing any chance of peace negotiations with Spain or France. (Because both of these countries were of the Catholic faith)<br>  Hope this helps a bit.|`|8Iy39btEaa	lol, this sounds like a school history essay to me.|`|shVgCizBaa	Why did Henry VIII fail to fulfil his ambitions in foreign policy in the years 1515-1529?   He wanted   to expand his holdings in northern France     France and the Habsburgs (1509-1525)<br>   <br>  Eighteen year-old Henry after his coronation in 1509.Henry was a Renaissance Man and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamourous excess, epitomised by The Field of the Cloth of Gold. He was an accomplished musician, author, and poet. His best known musical composition is Pastime with Good Company or The Kynges Ballade. He was also known to have been an avid gambler and dice player. He excelled at sports, especially jousting, hunting, and real tennis. He was also known for his strong dedication to Christianity.[3]<br>  <br>  In 1511, Pope Julius II proclaimed a Holy League against France. This new alliance rapidly grew to include not only Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, but also England. Henry decided to use the occasion as an excuse to expand his holdings in northern France. He concluded the Treaty of Westminster, a pledge of mutual aid with Spain against France, in November 1511 and prepared for involvement in the War of the League of Cambrai. In 1513, Henry invaded France and his troops defeated a French army at the Battle of the Spurs. His brother-in-law James IV of Scotland invaded England at the behest of Louis XII of France,[6] but failed to draw Henry's attention from France. The Scots were disastrously defeated at the Battle of Flodden Field on 9 September 1513. Among the dead were the Scottish King and the battle ended Scotland's brief involvement in the war.<br>  <br>  On 18 February 1516, Queen Catherine bore Henry his first child, Princess Mary of England, who later reigned as Mary I of England.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_...</a>

PXxd4EAYaa	Yes you can. The Fender Bassman e.g. was actually meant to be a bass amp but many guitarists played and are still playing it. <br>  But I don't know whether it's that good for the speaker.. Maybe someone else could give the all-clear.|`|AA10700407	no the amp has to match the guitar or they'll blow up.|`|AA11442722	It's not good for the amp.The high frequencies will likely tear the speaker. Other than that nothing limits you. I've heard of guitarists intentionally using bass amps as an amp. They probably have to recone their speakers fairly often.  You'll get better response on the bass frequencies than you would on a guitar amp but on treble your not going to get as good a response. Bass amps are not designed for those frequencies so it will dull out your sound a little. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to play it at low volumes until you do get an amp and preferably stay in the top 4 strings most of the time. Good luck on the contest.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	the speakers are designed to "accentuate" the qualities of bass or treble depending on the guitar, but yeah, you can|`|oM7zA7Jhaa	Yes you most definitly can!|`|KgKVWv9paa	I don't see why not, an amp is an amp.  Not that I have tried this, it just might no carry the same highs as a guitar amp.|`|ALR7H5d8aa	Yes u can, some musicians use a bass amp to play guitar right now. if u have an effects pedal its no problem in anyway because the bass amp is ment to bring the 'natural sound' of the bass and u can just change that.. i use a bass amp myself
