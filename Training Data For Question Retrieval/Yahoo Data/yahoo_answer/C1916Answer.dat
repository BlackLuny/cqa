kYANUuI8aa	Have you tried Start > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs?<br>  <br>  Who cares who dares?|`|97ncR6j5aa	on the bottom left  click start. next go to control panel. look for a sign that says "add or remove programs". Click on it. Next look for the game " zwinky" once you find it click remove and it will say are you sure you want to remove this program and click yes. It will delete it from your computer.|`|54a336ae2489ca5a5f3cc2546541e70daa	Okay first of all that program annoys the crap outta me too, so I'm with ya.<br>  <br>  If you're on a PC:<br>  You want to look on your start menu to see if the program has an uninstall file. So, click Start, then most likely All Programs or Program Files (depending on your version of windows), and then look for a the Zwinky game. You might have to look under Accessories as well. If you find it, there should be a file in there called Uninstall.<br>  <br>  If not, try this:<br>  Go to My Computer (either an Icon on your desktop or on your start menu) and click on your "C:/" drive (usually called Local Disk). Then click on program files. Look for a folder called "Zwinky" (it tends to be in alphabetical order). Look for a file called "uninstall" there.<br>  <br>  If that's not working, try this (and this should always be your last resort):<br>  <br>  Go to your Control Panel (On your start menu), and click "add or remove program" (it doesn't matter whether you're on category view or classic view). It should be defaulted to "Change or Remove Programs" (on the left side, a row of buttons. If 'Change or Remove Programs' is not selected, select it. You might have to wait for it to load before you can select it). Wait for the list to load. Once it's loaded (or populated as Windows calls it), you'll notice a long list of programs. Again, it should be defaulted to "sort by name". Scroll down to the bottom and find Zwinky. Click it once, and a button will appear saying "Remove Program". Click that, and it will take you step by step through the process.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!!|`|dl8zMw4Haa	there shud be an uninstall option .....or go to control panel and in the add remove select the program and click remove|`|eUmtvfIKaa	Go to www.filehippo,com and download, install and update these programs. They are all FREE and good.<br>  <br>  AdAware, SpyBot, CCleaner and AVG AntiVirus (if you have an anti virus program on your computer, don't download this one).<br>  <br>  Go to Start, Search and in the search box and type in zwinky, make sure you check search hidden folders and all files and folders, then delete all that comes up. <br>  <br>  Run each one of the above programs, one at a time, restart your computer and do a disk defrag. Restart again.<br>  <br>  If you are still having trouble, go by www.geekstogo.com and read their malware section and follow their instructions.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helped|`|yN1gO4xaaa	It's Windows.

I love it! <a href="http://pro.getright.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pro.getright.com/</a>|`|gWQjn86Saa	The best download manager is FLASHGET.<br>  <br>  The reason is that it's a stable download manager and you get no interuptions. Also, it has a function like bittorrent so that you could also use torrents to download. And its one of the popular ones out there. It has even been recommended for the best download manager for mmosite.com. Even I use the program and I had no problem with some of the old versions. <br>  <br>  What I'm stating is that if you have a version of FLASHGET, latest or old, then you're okay.

A la derecha tienes una flecha. Despliégala y selecciona "presentación con diapositivas de power point".<br>  6- Procede a guardar el documento.<br>  El archivo generado será de color azul.

They might not be the same but mine has 2 hinges built on the floor of the keyboard and there are two plastic things that when put together make an x and then you put the key on top and push down hard but its not easy at all to put the plastic on the hinges i had to bend my metal hinges alittle with a tool message me for more info

7pDi71Zkaa	Hi - is this one of the new Macbook Air models?  If this is the case, then it's not surprising the hard drive is full, as it is not very large to start with, and there are not many options yet for upgrades.<br>  <br>  If it is not a Macbook Air, the the external drive already mentioned is a viable option.  You could either go with a somewhat portable option which does not require a wall socket to run (powered by the USB connection):<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148258" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  or you could go with a less portable option:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148235" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  you can see the cost for portability, as the first one is 160Gig, while the second is 500Gig for about the same price.<br>  <br>  If you want to upgrade the drive inside your Mac, that is not too hard either.  There is free software that allows you to duplicate your existing hard drive onto a new, larger hard drive, then you need to swap the new, larger drive for the old hard drive, and you will have the exact same PC boot up, only with a lot more space.  The software that helps to do this is:<br>  <a href="http://www.bombich.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bombich.com/</a><br>  <br>  You would need to purchase an external enclosure with firewire, and then a new, larger hard drive to put in the enclosure, then run Bombich Carbon Copy Cloner to transfer your current hard drive to the new hard drive, then swap the new drive into your Mac, and keep the old Mac drive in the external case for extra storage.<br>  <br>  I can't give specifics for these parts until I know what kind of Mac you currently have (need to know if the hard drive is ATA-6, SATA 1.5, or SATA 3.0).  This information would determine what type of new hard drive to purchase as well as what type of external enclosure you would need.  If you edit the question with this info, or email me with it, I can give you some specifics - good luck|`|RJQlvMyMaa	Could just be you need more RAM.<br>  But an external hard drive isn't that expensive anymore.|`|fuwKmiHQaa	get an external one, or upgrade the current but a specialist needs to do it..as they';ll have to boot it again

D0JsiC0Paa	AOL (8Mbps) told me that was the case when I threatened to switch. I don't know what bench mark you're using to measure the decline in speed, because that seems awfully precise - but it could have a lot to do with the fact that it says 'upto 8mbps' - which means you can have up to and around that speed depending on the load on their system and your distance from the source, and maybe loads more people have subscribed to their service since you got on it and the speeds have subsequently dwindled to the relative crawl you're now experiecing. I doubt you'll get much joy out of telling them it's too slow, they'll just offer you a tantilizing upgrade to 16mbps which I hear is not much different - if you're unhappy, switch to a different service provider.
2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	Depends on the resolution.  At 1440x900 or less, probably so.  For even better performace I'd recommend a GTX 260.    However be aware that Crysis on highest detail is challenging even for systems with SLI/Crossfire high-end cards like the Radeon 4870 and dual-gpu cards like the GTX 295.    There is no single $200 card that will handle Crysis maxed out on 24" monitors.

uuDloQnCaa	Yes Avast does work with IE and Firefox protecting you while you while you surf.    Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|ye1tS9a2aa	uninstall it, their for mac computers|`|c59aa0746b771ce4755726e1da6772d1aa	Avast will provide you with protection whatever browser you use; although it also gives you some protection against spyware, you can safely add a free tool called Spywareblaster  http://www.filehippo.com/download_spywar...  update it and enable all protection; it willl help block malicious downloads from dodgy sites and doesn't need to be running all the time/    it's not a good idea to use a second antivirus product alongside Avast; if you think you need more protection online, consider using Threatfire which can be used alongside traditional antivirus tools  free  http://www.threatfire.com/

RoMxIa1Jaa	Yes, it is discipline, and no, you did nothing wrong (IMO).    Some people just look for reasons to report others.    You apparently didn't ask an actual question, so you were probably reported for "Chatting or otherwise violating the question-and-answer format" as per the Yahoo Community Guidelines.    Likewise, you could report "naxo 100"  because his *comment* (not answer) has absolutely nothing do do with your question.    Edit / Note: I assume my comment about naxo 100 (which is *part* of my total answer) is the reason for the thumb-downs.     The asker did not ask who was guilty regarding the malware infection, nor who is responsible for protecting his computer...   He asked about having his post deleted; and naxo 100 did not answer that.     If you read the question as it was asked, and the 'answer' posted by naxo 100, you will see that.    I didn't say that naxo 100's comment was *wrong* .   I said that it doesn't answer the question *that was asked* .    And it doesn't.    I stand by my answer in its totality.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Although your intention was to warn people, you "attacked" another user. Yahoo prefers that you inform them directly of these harmful posts and let them take care of it.|`|ZYS9AYS5aa	I think yahoo is not guilty at all  This is the responsibility of all online users to have Antivirus and A firewall     Edit: to heebus  Please read my answer again and i even don't care if you or others report my answer   I only deny the method that make your offence as a personal one?
AVDTZ63Oaa	Okay... hold on.  I think I get the problem..  You have a 3g card for your laptop. Basically talking to cell phone towers and the like. You want to use THAT connection as a gateway to run a LAN for your other machines yes?    You can do it, but it does take a special kind of router.. like this:  http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q...    You can ALSO, and this is weird, but you can use the laptop as the gateway, and connect your Belkin router to the wired port on the laptop, turn on connection sharing and do it that way, but like I said... weird.. Get the router. You don't need THAT exact router, but they all seem to be about the same $.. Google up "3g Router" and start following.|`|83vhCGW1aa	You can set your computer up as a wired gateway by connecting the ethernet port on your computer to the "internet in" port on the router, or get a router that can act as a bridge.  Whether it is a G or an N router shouldn't make a difference for your purposes except in the broadcast distance.  Of course either way if you take your laptop out of the house, everything in the house will use web access.  If you are interested in advances in wireless internet, check out WiMax from Clear.  Its only in Portland, Oregon, but they are planning on bringing it to other cities soon too.|`|AA12059007	G Wireless routers provided wireless connection  to most of the house.  N wireless routers provides connection inside and outside of the house.|`|2Q2ltt1Saa	Any wireless router will work.  802.11n provides more bandwidth within the network, but is still relatively new and semi-expensive.  802.11g is pretty much standard.    A good bet, for relatively cheap, is the Linksys WRT54GS.  It's about $70 or so, and you can modify the firmware to be able to do many things more expensive routers can do.
DjGEJfaPaa	Download and scan with Malwarebytes and/or SUPERAntiSpyware.    Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware are the best anti-spyware applications available (you can have more than one). Other free anti-spyware programs would be Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware, AVG Anti-spyware (formally Ewido), A-squared, Spyware Terminator and SpywareBlaster.    If you do not have an updated anti-virus program always running, you need to get one. Install only one, but you can get AVG, Avast! or AntiVir for free.    I strongly recommend using Firefox as your primary Web browser, It is safer and beter than Internet Explorer. Get the add-on NoScript for Firefox to prevent click-jacking. The AdBlock Plus extension will allow you to surf virtually ad-free.    I also highly recommend CCleaner and Advanced WindowsCare Personal which are great free programs to clean up your system including your registry.|`|dILqe7nBaa	http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/getstart...|`|nQ0A45ezaa	yeah.

hE6g7uhWaa	don't know c++,  but in python and java should be this.a    . operator stand's for (*pointer)->element  a is a variable and not an integer pointer.    the use of the this pointer is for methods inside a class, the way you are using it makes not sense, but suppose you have a class for comlex numbers, Re=a Im=b, and you have a method to calculate abs(complex Z),    In this case, each time you call the function you should pass the class to to it.  It would be    Z.abs(Z). But it's not necesary, because, you know that the values of a and b are the same from the object that de method abs() is being called. You don't need any arguments    Here is when you use the this pointer, and it'd just be:  int abs() {       sqrt(this.a*this.a+this.b*this.b)  }    where sqrt is a function that doesn't exist, but you get the idea right????

If I had to pick one of them I would go for the Compaq ( 3).    regards,  Philip T|`|N3AIS666aa	the second one has the higher capacity hard drive  but the third one has a better graphics card and processor. personally i would go with the compaq one because of its faster processor and graphics card- it will be better at playing the games. if you want more storage space for documents, photos and music etc you could just buy an external hard drive but 250GB is plenty for everyday gaming use.    hope i have helped you and your decision|`|lqN2WfEuaa	go with the Compaq , the emachines may look good but there a piece of ****!!!! Really id go with alittle better computer tho , Maybe get an Acer or Dell but if thats the price range u want ya go with the 3rd one (compaq)|`|b8tgCAQJaa	On all of those, the graphics processor is the same. It's a NVidia 6150 SE, which is built into the motherboard and isn't really intended for gaming at all (at least, not graphically heavy games released within the last 4 years or so). I'm not sure if it meets the minimum requirements for the LOTR 2 game even on the lowest settings, and even if it does the gameplay experience would not be very good with that chip.    At the very least you need a PC with a dedicated hardware graphic card, not some graphics processor built into the motherboard like that 6150 thing. You don't have to have a graphics card costing many hundreds of dollars, but you at least need a recent, middle of the range, Geforce or Radeon card if you actually intend to play any recent games on your PC.|`|O5HVCvRvaa	I would personally go with  3 the compaq, other than HDD capacity and Graphic card memories, these are pretty much the same spec wise. However you cannot over look quality of the computers. E-machine are known for their poor quality, mother board issues, and power supply failures. Compaq is not great, but better with the current comparison. With limited budget, i would suggest u should shop around more, dont limit yourself to only 3 choices, check out some other brands, HP, Dell, iBuyPower, there are better ones out there.

aZFP93kdaa	You can never be 100% sure.    If the address begins with https:// (note the "s") and is accompanied by the little padlock icon, then the communication between your computer and the site is safe from hackers.    However, you still have to trust that the merchant is honest and that their own server has not been broken into unbeknownst to them.    If you're dealing with a major retailer that you know in the real world, then chances are you're safe. To be extra careful, always use a credit card instead of a debit card. Keep an eye on your credit card statements to make sure no one else has used your card number to make purchases.    If you do notice a fraudulent purchase, notify your card company. You usually are only liable for a maximum of $50 once you've called to report it.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	About 25% of ISP's are configured to use improperly secured NS/DNS (Name Server/Domain Name Server), which could allow a hacker to create false website 'credentials', which you may be re-directed to & may look authentic, but are in fact 'spoofed';  with further spoofed links, log-in's, or any number of things the hacker wants to incorporate, intended to extract your personal information.

The most common SSL encryption program is call VERI SIGN. It will have a little logo with some arrows and the word verisign. Also, if you arent on a secure site, alot of times your browser will show a sign saying so. I am using internet explorer 7 and secure sites on this have a lock on the addressbar when you are tyoing in personal info.

aYPJoFI5aa	Yes, you can move or delete the uninstaller files once you're satisfied that the installed XP update, patch, hotfix, etc. is working as intended and you aren't having any issues. NOTE: XP expects the uninstaller files to be in a specific location. If they're moved or deleted and you ever need to uninstall one of those updates, it will cause problems.<br>  <br>  Moving the uninstaller files is as easy as creating a new folder and dragging / dropping.  Personally, once an XP update has been on my machine for a couple of months without causing problems, I delete the uninstaller files and remove the update from the Add/Remove Programs list.<br>  <br>  1. Open the add/remove programs window AND a folder window showing the contents of the C:\Windows folder.<br>  2. Position the two windows so you can see both at the same time (or toggle between the two with the task bar buttons.)<br>  3. In the C:\Windows folder window click tools > folder options > view tab.<br>  4. In the list of Advanced Settings make sure you select "show hidden files and folders" and DE-select (uncheck) "hide protected operating system files".<br>  5. Apply and save the changes and close the folder options dialog box.  The C:\Windows folder window should now show many faint folders with their names in blue.<br>  6. Select any one of those folders and you should see the entire name like: $NtUninstallKB123456$. Look in the add/remove programs window for the same KB number.<br>  7. When you've matched up the two KB numbers, you can delete the $NtUninstall...$ folder. (NOTE: You may not find some $NtUninstall...$ folders because Microsoft has determined the update is critical and should not be removed under any circumstances.)<br>  8. In the add/remove programs window select the update entry and click remove. You should see a notice that the uninstall file could not be located (makes sense - you just deleted it.)<br>  9. When you're prompted if you want to remove the program from the program list, answer yes.<br>  10. Continue doing the same for all remaining update uninstall files.<br>  <br>  Again, once you remove the uninstall files it will be very difficult to remove the actual update. But if your comp has been working without problems, go for it.  You might free up a gig or two of space on the hard drive. This article briefly touches upon deleting uninstall files.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10877_11-6100994.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/510...</a><br>  <br>  wwbgd
58Ms1Kf5aa	well, the first thing I would try is  a system restore. Restore the computer to a date before you originally installed itunes. You can do this by going to all programs->acessories->system tools->system restore. select the date and click next and it will restart and restore your computer to that date. It DOES not mess with your personal files, just major system changes made and programs. So that should correct any mistakes you could have made. If that doesnt work, contact the vendor for the computer and explain your problem to them, windows vista has a massive amount of bugs that need fixing. It could just be the operating system. Good Luck.|`|vFoCjsSmaa	louishilley@yahoo.com

B= 11Mbps  G= 54Mbps  N= up to 300Mbps    To find out what sort of wireless card you have your only options are to either check the make model number or connect and see what thoughput you get.    You will still get some of the benefits of N even with a G - because N routers have a stronger broadcast signal - meaning you stand a better chance of getting a good strong signal at greater distances from the router.|`|NZxvybYUaa	You'll need a wireless N adapter.

Merely 'deleting' from your mail viewing application will not stop this cycle, and 'block sender' fails because it's only blocks that specific sender...& once they discover your address, all they have to do is change a single character of the senders name, and they start getting their junk through again (depending on your filtering settings).        You want to end that notification, from the Server (your ISP) level.  Get a program that will 'preview' all mail while still on the server,  and 'bounce' the selected mail back to the spam sender ; in effect saying, 'This address is invalid' and they eventually stop sending junk.

2LHgmq97aa	With the Mac you are paying significantly more for lower spec hardware.  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3) Like the Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...  4) It is faster/MORE SECURE.

For easy instructions on setting up Dual Boot http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windo...    VIRUSES  Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    SECURITY  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-op...

They might be more for business, but they're the king of quality in terms of how long they will last and how great their parts are. If you don't like their look, buy an Ideapad. They're from the same company and have the same build quality.    If you are going to college, don't buy a mac. So many college students do that, and don't seem to comprehend that a PC works just as fine- and can be bought for less and have better specs.    For $1200, you can get a very good laptop that will last for a long time- not a mac that will be obsolete when Apple updates their Macbook lineup in a year.|`|MIR3eC5kaa	i would get a top of the line sony viao laptop that has a good nvidia graphics card bestbuy is a good place for sony and mac|`|AA10116317	Sony VAIO  Thats what I am using now and its great!

Have you worked with OS X? Have you worked with Vista? Depending on that, then the only brand for OS X is Apple, and for Vista, there are at the very least thirty brands. Your Warcraft game will work on either, I believe. Macs are reliable, yet pricey. Vista is practical, for the most part, and the software is relatively more affordable and abundant. You can get a very nice laptop from Sony for a little less than the Mac, but depending on your preference will depend which you choose. I would go to Best Buy or an electronics store and test them both out, side by side. The Viao and Macbooks are two good lines.

Why do you have to love someone of your own race more or before you love another race? Why? Why can't you love or not love whoever you want, without race being an issue? What does it matter? Really? Why is white better than black? Or black better than white? Or whatever! It's not! I'm white and I don't feel any more important or attractive or powerful or anything than someone of a minority race or whoever...   Who cares about the statistics he was talking about?

SkpRC2Nmaa	You can try to go to the site bellow to check which program can read that file    http://www.filext.com
dkpIjt5jaa	Easy answer: Because it is a weak program !    Now on to how to remove:    Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware.    Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.

Also, you will be shown a limited profile for a user IF you are not Friends with them and interact with them, like emailing each other, etc..    So in most cases, if you are seeing a limited profile it's not because you are on their limited list, but because you are not Friends with them and they have their privacy settings set to allow anyone to see their Limited profile.    If they are your Friend and you can't post on their wall, do certain activities, then you know for sure they limited you. :)    Hope this helps!|`|C4LT48CFaa	you can tell if you're blocked from posting on their wall or seeing their friends, if things are missing that you can see on other profiles.

EZicikyQaa	If live in one of following  States, this is your rights.  COMMON CONSUMER RIGHTS    Directive 1999/44/EC on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees has been implemented by Austria, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the UK.     As a result of this legislation, all consumers, who buy goods in one of the above Member States, have the same right to a minimum guarantee of six months on products. Within the first six months of purchase, any lack of conformity or defect shall be presumed to have existed at the time of delivery, unless proved otherwise.   Within this period the consumer is entitled to have the goods brought into conformity free of charge. The consumer is entitled to ask for the goods to be repaired or replaced free of charge.  Moreover, after this initial six-month period the consumers are still protected against faulty products. Within two years from delivery of the goods the trader still can be held liable for any lack of conformity. It should be noted, however, that after the first six months, it is up to the consumer to prove that the lack of conformity existed at the time of delivery.     Voluntary guarantees given by a producer do not restrict the statutory rights of consumers.    For specific information and advice on EU consumer rights, please contact one of the 15 Centres of the European Consumer Centre Network.

This is so that relatively inexperienced users can just use the default apps without accidentally breaking anything, but it's obviously frustrating if you want to customise your desktop and install your own software.    If you want to install software on your Aspire One, you'll need to enable certain options and access a "hidden" menu.

ejbSFv0caa	There is no 'best' as such...    However, the best monitors performance wise have to be CRT.    After that you might go for a TFT that is not TN technology.    With TFT you might get what you pay for, but aditionally of the various technologies available each are better at one or other of the control of contrast, veiwing angles , colour rendition, speed of refresh.    You really do need to see the screen you think you want running in the way that you will use it.  CRT's are easier to consider in that they are far more flexible all round.  But the biggest and best weigh as much as a Tank and take up a lot of desk space.    So you need to concentrate on what sort of usage you will really make and compromise only in the areas that don't matter to you.    UPDATE:  The PCWorld link fails to deliver any where near the sort of detail we all really need in order to buy a monitor.      PCFormat Magazine  223 goes into the various technologies and illustrates just how important the information that is NOT provided easily by the retailers like PCWorld really is.  Just try asking what resolution a screen is and watch how their eyes glaze over if the resolution is not mentioned on the card!  You will instead be told of Dynamic Contrast [a minefield] and glossy deep Blacks [that reflect everything that is not Black!]|`|RfHrij3Gaa	I dont think there is no best monitor.... haha  U should consider the features and pricing for different brand.|`|AuvLNaaTaa	cant really answer that  you have no ideas of what you want    the apple cinema display is great but expensive|`|DgWUovrQaa	How to Buy a Monitor

CZjpqLvRaa	If the domain is allowed to expire the domain is put in the on-hold status and will stop functioning, and the site that uses this domain will appear to be down.    During the on-hold status, the domain can still be renewed at normal renewal rates by the owner. The on-hold status duration varies between registrars.    Then if still not renewed it will go into the redemption period which lasts for 30 days at all registrars during which the previous owner can still renew. Usually renewal costs are larger than a general renewal rate.     Pending Delete status is the final status prior to release of a domain name. This status follows the redemption period and lasts up to 5 days.    Few domains actually enter the pending delete period if they are any good.They are placed into an auction by the registrar and only if there are no bids do they eventually drop. Typically 45 days after expiration.    There are numerous drop catching services like expireddomains.com|`|EsUzVCkPaa	It sounds like you should, I think there are companies out there that you can go through that can try to get the site for you, If under construction messages were on the site, they are either really not using it or maybe holding on to it for some reason.

The opacity of a track/layer defaults to 100% which means you cannot see anything underneath it...which is why you have to drop it from 100% to 50%.

If you want a gaming laptop, you'll have to look for a laptop that has a minimum 2.2Ghz processor, and preferably an HD36xx (or better) class graphics suite (discrete is better than integrated), minimum 300G HDD, and 2 Ghz memory minimum.    ASUS had a laptop that fulfilled all these specs, but they fiddled with it and went with a 9x(?) class nVidia chipset. The performace was worse, simply because the 9x platform is essentialy an 8x platform (which was good), that has been tweaked, renamed, and sold for "New Generation" prices...despite the fact that the older tech was more reliable. >Sigh    Anyway...keep in mind that you have to be rich to keep a gaming laptop up-to-date...

With a netbook you usually get a VERY small hard drive which is usually between 8-64 GB whereas the standard is closer to 200-300 GB in notebooks. Also, you will only get 1 GB of ram, keep in mind windows 64 bit now supports up to 16 GIG in a regular laptop so you're really putting yourself in a potion where you have limited upgrade-ability there too. Another thing to consider is the lack of an "optical drive" in a netbook commonly known as a dvd/cd drive, this means you will not be able to install software unless you purchase it over the internet. (But remember you have a VERY small hard drive, so you're not going to be able to install many programs) Meanwhile your stuck with the far inferior "Atom" processor, which is the "brains" of your computer. Look for a good deal and you will be able to find a fully functional computer (laptop) for around $600 that will serve you for years. Also, if you're dead set on a netbook, check USER reviews for specific netbooks you're looking at on different electronic web sites like best buy.com, amazon, qvc.com ect. Many of the people who bought these netbooks are unhappy for one reason or another after they get it home and realize how small the screen is and how slow the processor is. I beleive, however, that HP is viewed as the best netbook over the Acer's, EEE's, and the others.
83vhCGW1aa	Yes, this could happen a couple of ways.      A router basically sets up a home network for you.  It is possible for virus's to travel over a network, from one computer to another, although there are software & hardware solutions to make this less likely.  So one possibility is that your wired computer had a virus that screws with wireless internet.  Now that wouldn't effect the wired computer at all, because it doesn't have wireless internet.  Then the virus migrates over to your computer that does have a wireless connection, and thats when the teeth come out.  That is one possibility.    Another possibility is that your wired computer is hogging most of your internet bandwidth, so your wireless computer has a slow internet connection, or no connection.    If you are interested in advances in wireless internet, you should check out WiMax from clear.  It provides cheap, high speed, wireless access.  Unfortunately its only in Portland, Oregon right now, but it will be in other cities soon too.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Last week, I would have said no.     I am having a similar problem where a laptop is connected to my wireless network.   The laptop is having problems that I am having trouble fixing.   I cannot install my anti virus software or get spybot or malwarebytes to run on it.     Whenever I start to download Mcafee updates on the laptop, my whole internet connection (all computers connected to the router) drops.       Not sure what it is doing.   At first i thought it was changing router settings so I changed the password to the router but it is still happening.    Maybe it is doing some activity that my ISP is detecting and cutting off my access temporarily.        Still trying to figure it out but I can say that what you are experiencing is possible and happening to me.|`|dILqe7nBaa	turn off your router for 3 to 5 minutes and restart that made mine work

If there is something you want prevent a user from doing, you should approach the problem within the constraints of the application, opposed to attempting to break a user's browser.

If not, log in to the router's configuration page, find the wireless settings, and find the WPA key from there.|`|BByDc3PAaa	You need to login to your router and you will find it there.    If you haven't changed it since you got the router, then it might be on the back of the router somewhere|`|BZYen6glaa	I would just recommend reseting the router in the back by pushing that little factory reset button with a pen if you lost your password. Otherwise if you forgot the password or trying to crack/hack a WPA password it takes a lot of work.
4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	it's a good laptop, but the only thing that i can suggest is updating absolutly all the drivers on it.    try drivermax ( www.download.com )    apart from that, there isnt.  it struggles to work on my system and it's pretty powerful.     have you tried it on the laptop? is there any problems??    Edit_    you have to have every single thing on 0 or 1     all the graphics to low and see what happens.    I have heard from people who have paid over a few thousand pounds for there systems and it's struggling to run, but update all the drivers, make sure that you have installed the 2 game updates, it really makes a diffrence. probably not much on your system though but it should play slightly smoother.    close any programs you can that are running. also i would open the task manager (ctrl alt del) and close what you can, or think you can. it all makes a diffrence.    Edit_2    one thing that i have noticed though, online play is much smoother, and runs a lot better.
dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware.    Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|RSJbqioUaa	Is it the infamous "MAN FLU" SXY?    ps. Btw....do you have messenger?|`|WaI693jHaa	It sounds like adware rather than a virus. Use malwarebytes or spybot s&d and it will definitely be found.|`|smA22aNHaa	AVG let me down badly when it stopped updating. Since that I have been using avira4home.It is much better and is free from avira.com|`|EmgiGg17aa	use a different adware checking program such as Ad-Aware(by Lavasoft). Use the free trial version.   Let it take a look.       It will find something which might be related to your ad-ware.    Also try Spybot Search& Destroy.  It is free as well.    Let it look too.  You will have to uninstall Ad-Aware after using it as Spybot has problems with it - it sees it as a problem program(and Vice versa I might add) so you cannot run both at the same time.  If they do not manage to clear it out then the next time you see the warning "CE7host yadayada" copy it down on paper and then google it in the search bar just typing in what showed up on the screen and hit the search button.   Maybe another tool is used to fix this problem.   You will have to go thru a number of websites until you find the answer you want.|`|D7Dubtt9aa	No mate not a virus it is ad ware.

If you look over the internet you can find graphs which show how well anti virus software is at catching viruses and spy ware and AVG free scores pretty low|`|AA10834300	Yes, it's likely that you have a virus or some kind of malicious software.    Try some of these free online scans to see if they can pick anything else up:      Trend Micro Housecall  http://housecall.trendmicro.com/    and    Kaspersky Online Scanner  http://www.kaspersky.com/virusscanner    and    Ewido Online Scanner  http://www.ewido.net/en/onlinescan/      Although AVG is a good free product, it may have let something get through because it isn't updated as often as some of the paid products.    If you keep having these problems, you should consider buying a paid for virus scanning program. I recommend Kaspersky Internet Security.    If you still have trouble removing the virus, then there are plenty of online forums that should able to help you.    http://www.bleepingcomputer.com|`|w6lVjQigaa	I think you do as AVG isn't the best security for your computer. You should download a better program such as Kaspersky or Norton

I suspect that if you have some music files there, then they are stored in other locations on your computer.    Sorry if I've misunderstood your question but "My Music" is just a standard folder that is built into Windows, there's nothing else special about it. It just contains files.

l4anfnt7aa	If you are using wires to connect to both the xbox and your PC, then the position of your router should have nothing to do with the connection.    Then again, maybe the longer cable is bad, since that is the one that's having trouble. This seems kind of unlikely, but it's not impossible. Unfortunately you might want to try a different long cable.    But if your PC says you have limited or no connection, it sounds like the PC can see the router, but not the Internet. Which means you need to verify your router settings in that case.    All of this is assuming you are not posting this message from the same computer that was having the problem.    Anyway, just make sure your router is getting an IP from your internet provider, and make sure neither the xbox nor your PC are set up with static (manually set) IP addresses.|`|sGdBzRcuaa	Please provide more details.

You can use the ethernet port on the laptop which has an Internet connection to share that connection. Simply buy a LAN cable (it might have to be a patch cable) and either plug the other end into your other laptop or a wireless router, and if you're using Windows XP, go to network connections and right click on the active connection and select properties. From there you can enable Internet connection sharing (ICS).

DCXk0bVLaa	Any audio editing or recording app can seem complicated to a beginner.  Audacity is a good one. Try it first.  You could also try Mixcraft. It's not too expensive.  If a song is recorded with lack of clarity or contains distortion there is not too much you can do about it.  The input = the output.  No program will help much in this respect.  Excessive bass can be reduced with the graphic equalizer function.  Bitrate refers to the quality (or size) of the file, not the volume.  The higher the bitrate the better the quality.  To adjust the volume level in Audacity you need to use the "amplify" function via the effects menu. It is also known as "normalizing"    http://audacity.sourceforge.net/    http://www.acoustica.com/mixcraft/   (has free trial)|`|2SSA9e9Naa	Try audacity at http://audacity.sourceforge.net.|`|4g5Hu1U7aa	might be a little more professional then what your looking for, but Adobe Audition is AWESOME.

fE7zhp3Caa	PowerPC, made by IBM and Motorola, and they were RISC processors.    RISC is Reduced Instruction Set Computing.  They focus on simple processor instructions that can be performed very fast individually.    CISC is Complex Instruction Set Computing or Complete Instruction Set Computing, which relies on more complicated instructions that do more but may take more time to execute than a single RISC instruction.    Each has advantages and disadvantages.  RISC requires breaking down operations into very basic steps, but the steps themselves can be performed very fast.  CISC can reduce the number of steps needed to perform a specific function, but the steps take longer because more work is being done.

Current processor I am running is AMD Phenom 2.3GHz 9600 Black Edition. I successfully overclocked it to 2.5GHz The main problem you will encounter with Overclocking is additional heat generation off the processor. I still have my Stock Cooler on my CPU and When I've ran a stress test on it, the highest it has gone was 48 Celsius, thank AMD for making some decent stock coolers. Each processor is different and it also depends on what kind of cooler you have and how well air flows through your case. If done properly overclocking can be done safe. Sometimes to get the full Overclock out of the processor you need to up the voltages which will also raise how much more heat is generated. Overclocking is not recommended if you have no idea what your doing and its not a good thing to fiddle around with the BIOS settings.|`|4YmB7q5jaa	it could burn out your CPU

ViKhxSQFaa	How long is your graphics card slot? where does it go on your motherboard? An older comp will probably use pci (about 3inches and light color), newer ones usually pci x16 (its the longer black one). Pci x16 is better if you have that on your motherboard you can use a Pci x16 graphics card.   The Nvidia 8600 Gts is a pretty good one you can get for a good price, abou $50. But it depends on what you need your comp for really.

D5Asu04eaa	Hi,       If both computer using different modem and isp ..dialup..or dsl ..Then they both have different ip ..but if you both computer connected to a router then there should be three IP    1 ip of router like 192.168.1.1  No 2 ip of your first pc like 192.168.1.100 any other assign by router  No 3 ip of your 2nd pc like 192.168.1.101 or any assing by your router..    Router connected to your ISP which issuing you only a single IP it could be a dedicated or shared IP ..    ISP negociate with your router not with your PC ..And its WAN..    your PCs and router is LAN ..    But you can Forward any port from you router to both computer at same time but port should be different for example    If you want to use remote desktop on 1st PC you have to forward PORT 3389 from your router for 1st PC and now people from outer world can see this service and connect with PC 1st ..At the same time you access other service on 2nd PC like FTP (21 port) simply from ROUTER forward PORT 21 and now your 2nd PC is also sharing 1 service called FTP ..You can also turned on Remote desktop on 2nd pc at same time but in this CASE change the 2nd PC port from 3389 to Different like 3390 and then enable that port in router setup ..

AA11312040	Ingest into YouTube always involves a transcoding step unless your source content precisely matches the output format and settings they are looking for, which is very difficult, if not impractical in most cases.     Recognizing YouTube will transcode no matter what its best to start with the highest quality video possible. Most commercial providers send 16:9 aspect ratio MP4 files encoded using the H.264 codec, with the highest video bitrate the content will support.    I would try exporting from Flash directly as an H.264 file, uploading that output to YouTube to see if it provides any improvement.

If you have Windows XP Home Edition, then when you get to the login screen, try going Ctrl-Alt-Del twice. This will bring up a classic login menu. Then try typing Administrator in there with no password (unless you already logon as Administrator)|`|ceb5ee23003fe9620eaeba9143419106aa	If thats your only problem, then you probably have nothing to worry about. As long as you have your Windows XP CD, you can get back into your system using a simple but effective method made possible by a little known access hole in Windows XP.    This method is easy enough for newbies to follow  it doesnt require using the Recovery Console or any complicated commands. And its free - I mention that because you can pay two hundred dollars for an emergency download of Winternals ERD with Locksmith which is a utility for unlocking lost Windows passwords. See here http://www.winternals.com/products/repai...    ERD is an excellent multi purpose product, but you should know it is not a necessary one if you have a healthy system and your sole problem is the inability to logon to Windows due to a forgotten password. Not necessary because you can easily change or wipe out your Administrator password for free during a Windows XP Repair. Heres how with a step-by-step description of the initial Repair process included for newbies.    1. Place your Windows XP CD in your cd-rom and start your computer (its assumed here that your XP CD is bootable  as it should be - and that you have your bios set to boot from CD)    2. Keep your eye on the screen messages for booting to your cd Typically, it will be Press any key to boot from cd    3. Once you get in, the first screen will indicate that Setup is inspecting your system and loading files.    4. When you get to the Welcome to Setup screen, press ENTER to Setup Windows now    5. The Licensing Agreement comes next - Press F8 to accept it.    6. The next screen is the Setup screen which gives you the option to do a Repair.    It should read something like If one of the following Windows XP installations is damaged, Setup can try to repair it    Use the up and down arrow keys to select your XP installation (if you only have one, it should already be selected) and press R to begin the Repair process.    7. Let the Repair run. Setup will now check your disks and then start copying files which can take several minutes.    8. Shortly after the Copying Files stage, you will be required to reboot. (this will happen automatically  you will see a progress bar stating Your computer will reboot in 15 seconds    9. During the reboot, do not make the mistake of pressing any key to boot from the CD again! Setup will resume automatically with the standard billboard screens and you will notice Installing Windows is highlighted.    10. Keep your eye on the lower left hand side of the screen and when you see the Installing Devices progress bar, press SHIFT + F10. This is the security hole! A command console will now open up giving you the potential for wide access to your system.    11. At the prompt, type NUSRMGR.CPL and press Enter. Voila! You have just gained graphical access to your User Accounts in the Control Panel.    12. Now simply pick the account you need to change and remove or change your password as you prefer. If you want to log on without having to enter your new password, you can type control userpasswords2 at the prompt and choose to log on without being asked for password. After youve made your changes close the windows, exit the command box and continue on with the Repair (have your Product key handy).    13. Once the Repair is done, you will be able to log on with your new password (or without a password if you chose not to use one or if you chose not to be asked for a password). Your programs and personalized settings should remain intact.    I tested the above on Windows XP Pro with and without SP1 and also used this method in a real situation where someone could not remember their password and it worked like a charm to fix the problem. This security hole allows access to more than just user accounts. You can also access the Registry and Policy Editor, for example. And its gui access with mouse control. Of course, a Product Key will be needed to continue with the Repair after making the changes, but for anyone intent on gaining access to your system, this would be no problem.    And in case you are wondering, NO, you cannot cancel install after making the changes and expect to logon with your new password.    Cancelling will just result in Setup resuming at bootup and your changes will be lost.    Ok, now that your logon problem is fixed, you should make a point to prevent it from ever happening again by creating a Password Reset Disk. This is a floppy disk you can use in the event you ever forget your log on password. It allows you to set a new password.    Here's how to create one if your computer is NOT on a domain:    Go to the Control Panel and open up User Accounts.   Choose your account (under Pick An Account to Change) and under Related Tasks, click "Prevent a forgotten password".   This will initiate a wizard.   Click Next and then insert a blank formatted floppy disk into your A: drive.   Click Next and enter your logon pas|`|HI8xzhguaa	Buy a password unlock from ebay on another computer or moblie device|`|2qktUSFDaa	ur screwed unless i guess u put in new memory chips, highly unlikely but try

AA10826645	I know you are not going to like this answer but Netgear is famous for this type of behavior.  I would buy a Linksys router as I have been testing all wireless routers for the past year and Linksys is about the best bang for the buck!  Cisco rocks but can be expensive.  Throw the Netgear out and watch the garbage men not even take it!!!|`|BByDc3PAaa	Try resetting your router by unplugging it and the turning it back on (although you probably have done that)    Make sure the antenna at the back of the router is pushed all the way in aswell as it could have come loose.    If that doesn't work then I think you will need a new router.

ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	There is one wire between the DSL modem and your computer. Connect that between the modem and the WAN slot on your new router. Then connect another wire between one of the four (usually) LAN slots on the router to your computer. You will have to follow the instructions for your  wireless router to set this all up. Then you will have wifi for the PS3 and any other wifi computer you may have, plus wires for a wired network.     Now that is the ideal situation. However I find the following site that says "don't buy this discontinued router".  http://www.epinions.com/review/pr-Micros...  I think you need to go out and buy another wireless router. Almost any Linksys, d-link, Belkin wifi router should do. If you but an N router make sure to set the router to use "mixed b/g/n mode" so that g and n devices can both connect.|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	Set the m-700 as an access point.

Opt for the piece of plastic that is susceptible to all kinds of maleware. Sure, it costs about a grand less then a Mac, but you'll get about a year out of it before buying a new one right?    I'm not saying Macs are perfect, Josh, but when a computer is made out of the same **** as a ******* multi-million dollar airplane, its probably not a bad purchase. If you can find me a plastic airplane then I'll eat my words.    Go with the MacBook Pro Joshy, you will be in love.

VdHKQMeXaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.    1. De-Fragmenting  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4. Check for Spyware and Adware  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your pc    5. Clean your Registry  Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!

You can find information about it here.. http://www.freebielog.co.uk/category/sof...    Scroll down and click on the "Spybot search and destroy" link.    Good luck|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware.    Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.

(see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|BByDc3PAaa	Scan it with one of these:    http://www.microsoft.com/windows/product...    or    http://free.avg.com/

T7Apky52aa	Yes. If you're going to be printing that size, you do want to design at that size. Otherwise, if you had a smaller image and blew it up to the size you wanted it would get pixelated. Take any image and blow it up to 300% or more and you'll see what I mean.    But working with an image that size you can detail parts of the image, and they'll be seen much more than if you were working at a smaller size.    You can always start at a larger size and go smaller without any problems, just not the other way.

a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	All free ones are crap.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Resident help is always better but none are the BEST !    Here are my suggestions (and warnings) for free software (I tried all personally):    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not.     Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.       If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include anti-spyware and anti-adware protection so add an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and see below for adware scanning.    Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security) as there is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !|`|FBQZ06vraa	There is nothing that will get rid of everything, and I wouldn't even try anything that claimed it could.  Here's a decent plan of attack to try:    If you have an anti-virus, make sure it has the latest virus definitions and run a scan with it in Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking.  That often prevents malware from protecting itself.  If you dont have one, many people here swear by AVG (its free).     I suggest you also download Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D (theyre free), install them, update them and run them. If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesnt seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode.     Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.      To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:    1. Log out and reboot your machine.  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.    6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.    Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.    Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.    Good luck.
ewbuVeTTaa	You can try to snap the key back on by pressing down on it hard, if that doesn't work, you will have to replace the whole keyboard. On a laptop, if you know how, this is not difficult or expensive if out of warranty. Laptop keyboards are designed that if they fail in any way, they are replaced as an assembly. So, if one key fails on it, you replace the whole thing. At most, a $150 job out of warranty flat rate. If I was in NY, I could replace it for you for that. I am HP certified on most of their equipment, including their laptops.

6vjRPS7eaa	It is very unlikely that your problem is in the Windows hosts file, most likely you could have one of the following issues:    a) Firewall issues, make sure your windows firewall allows incoming port 80 connections. Also, make sure that your router has port 80 open.    You can use the following site to test which ports are open in you firewall: https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2    b) Make sure that your domain name is pointing to your computer: To do this take note of the ip address returned when you test your site using grc.com, then     > Click on Start  > Run  > Type cmd and press Enter  > nslookup yourwebsite.com    Look for the ip address it must match the one provided by grc.com, if it does not the problem is with your dns setup.    c) make sure that WAMP is runing by doing this    > Click on Start  > Run  > Type net start and press Enter    You should see Apache or httpd listed if not remove and reinstall WAMP.

A CSV file is not a proprietary format created by a single application, but it is a common file format type that many applications can understand and open.    A CSV file is just a plain text file, so you can open it in any text editor like Notepad or even Word if you want.    What it's typically used for is to create a flat text file of table records from a database. Each record is on a single line in the CSV file, and all the field values in each record (line) are separated by commas.   That's where the CSV name comes from: "Comma Separated Values'.    So because it's a structured format for a database table, you can also open it up in Excel or even load it into a database.    ----------    2nd Rely:    I didn't see this Question was in the Programming group, so maybe you do mean "CVS" for programming purposes.

It is pretty convienient to see that your buddy is "out getting beer, leave me one and i'll drink to that when i get back". I leave away messages all the time so that people don't think that i am ignoring them. I know i should prob just turn it off, but i leave it up most the time incase someone feels like messaging.

9830d7f35b6420f47deb9906297e10abaa	Believe it or not, files aren't stored in one contiguous chunk on disk.  There are what are called file descriptors (fd), which hold information about files (name, location, size, and pointers to pointers to the file data (as well as to other pointers to file data).  Most file systems use a  triple indirection scheme wrt to these pointers (three levels of pointers is the most you can have, which limits the size of an individual file to something like 2gb, though you can get around this limit).  The reason for the fragmentation is that the many parts of files are spread out across the disk (though a smart OS would optimize for reading, some don't) and when a file is deleted, it leaves many holes that are hard for the OS to fill in later.  It is possible, but hard.  Note that if you use lots of large files, and delete/replace them a lot, fragmentation will occur a lot faster than if you have many more smaller files that you delete/replace just as (if not more) frequently.|`|AA12121778	This will answer your question.|`|cd5c9a078c5b3f77a695aa71894f2818aa	Because the computer writes to the hard drive in the easiest way possible for itself. not taking into consideration on how to retrieve the data at a later time.

zorYTX59aa	Every single video and every person with a channel profile on  YouTube has their own unique individual website.     You can thus always refer to them and create a direct link to   either of them by simply including their "website URL" in any   question that you ask or answer that you provide -- or on any   other websites.    Here below are two examples:  the 1st is a "link" to a video,  the 2nd Is a "link" to a channel.    http://youtube.com/watch?v=L3-50WJ4Z-A  http://youtube.com/inukjuak89    To include such a link within Yahoo! Answers or within some  other website, you must do the following steps:    1 -- open another "window" and go the video or channel page.  2 -- click on its "URL" which will highlight itself automatically.  3 -- keep your finger on "CTRL" while you press the letter "C".  4 -- go to the "screen" with your question, answer or website.  5 -- when you feel you're ready to insert the "link", keep your  finger on "CTRL" and press the letter "V".    Your "copy-&-paste" may at first appear just like regular text   on the screen. In the case of Yahoo! Answers, only after you   finally click on the "Submit" button, will the link become blue.  It may also appear slightly cut off at the end.     Please don't worry about that at all. The link will still be valid.  Just remember to use the "URL" at the very top of your page.

Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!
AA11301803	Too vague. It could be a ton of things. My first guess is not a virus because it isn't happening all the time. Since it happens to be mostly when you are playing games my first guess would be your video card. Make sure that the card you are using matches the specs of the games you are playing - then update all the drivers for your current card and try again. If that doesn't work you might need a new card. It also could be memory. Try adding more. Your computer also could be running too hot so it turns itself off to prevent damage. Are all of your fans running? Check bios to see if your temperature is normal. Blow a high powered regular room fan on it while you are playing the games and see if it turns off then. Could be the power supply too. There are so many things. If this all sounds too daunting bring it to a tech or best buy and they can fix it for you, but they'll charge a ton and probably just tell you to buy a new computer from them.|`|AA10878563	Sounds like a virus? you sound like a dumb-***.

AA10097192	EJB isn't a programming language. Entreprise Java Beans is a form of programming. It uses the best of patterns and thinking to derive the best solution to do your webapplication.    But EJB requires some precompiled headers and context listeners to be active before running the application, It will be more work for you to do it within apache tomcat. I would recommend you to use JBOSS.    JBOSS is a superset of Tomcat, it uses Tomcat with added features. JBOSS Server can be downloaded for free from http://www.jboss.org and you can use ECLIPSE ( http://www.eclipse.org ) for your IDE to program EJB applications.     So what I recommend is to download Eclipse IDE and JBOSS Server. Jboss has a Jboss eclipse plugin if you want to make deploying and packaging easier as well. You could use netbeans as well.    Thats my recommendation! Good Luck|`|AA10350275	how come you are in hiding again?you're very strange|`|b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	latest version listed on their website is 5.x    not sure about EJB support. try for details on the link below.    http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.ht...    hope this helps|`|9fbcfb1c55f67191972611150a1ba688aa	5.5 is the latest version, but heard that its supporting EJB too but i am not sure abt that just chek it out here  http://tomcat.apache.org/

x35co5F8aa	You can get 'clipboard managers'.  There are tools which enable you to copy, copy, copy - and it will keep them in a separate area. Later on, you can simply paste (the last copied item) or you can open your manager and paste from the history.<br>  <br>  Generally, the history isn't available to you if you didn't install software. I use Opera internet browser - for me, when I copy from a web page, I generally 'copy to note'. The text is not only copied to a notepad inside Opera browser, but also synchtonised. I can read the same note at work on my Opera installation there after I log in and synchronise there!<br>  <br>  Online synchronisation is rather cool - Opera is my very favourite web browser (though Firefox is amazing, and has more options and more power). Sometimes when I'm working on documents, I'll open Opera and use it to keep clips as notes - then I can continue to work on the same document at home. I use it to keep the list of links posted below...<br>  <br>  However, for general cutting and pasting I use 'glipper' for my gnome desktop. When I want to paste, I can either press my middle mouse button and insert the last item that I copied, or I can press <ctrl><alt>c which brings up a 'context menu' listing the history of stored clips. I select one, then paste it wherever I wish.|`|YT4IMnbBaa	In your situation I doubt you will be able to recover the files.

Only the folders that this option ticked will synchronise with a file server, so any of the ones you don't want to synchronise, just deselect that option and they should be excluded from synchronisation.    See also:    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307853    Specifically "Making files or folders unavailable offline".    Also - drag the private folders to your desktop or My Documents folder so that they are then only stored on your laptop and not on the file server.    == IMPORTANT ==    Before you carry out any of the above, please note how file synchronisation works.    The files are stored on a file server (at your work).    You synchronise them to be on your laptop (not the other way around). They aren't stored on your laptop and being synched to work.    They are stored at work and being synched to the laptop.    If you don't want them to be stored at work, then drag them to the Desktop. That way - they will definately only be on the laptop and not on the file server or "At work".    I hope that makes sense.

To get to the system restore, if you can manage to get there with your messed up computer, click start button on bottom task bar, then go to program files, next click acessories, and then go to system tools, and finally click system restore.  Once you have clicked system restore a window will pop up asking if A) you want to make a restore point, B) Restore to an earlier time.  Click "Restore to an earlier time".  Then it hopefully gives you a calendar with a bunch of dates on it... Some are blue and some are greyed out.  The blue ones are restore points that you can utilize to go back to that exact date.  Literally, everything on the computer you have will be exactly like the date that you restored it to.  Sometimes this doesn't work...  So you have to choose another date.  What it will do is once you press restore, the computer will restart and change it back to the way it was in the past.  When it restarts, it either says, "system restored successfully" or something along the lines of "Failed to restore to an earlier date".  If it says failed, pick another date (a different one), but be sure it is an earlier date than when the computer screwed up.  I hope this helps you.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you have to put the windows xp install disc in and choose "boot from cd." and it will walk you thru it.  Hopefully you kept the system disk...

OsYJhMTkaa	As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.<br>  If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.<br>  One of these services is reachable at: <a href="http://bluehost-service.atspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://bluehost-service.atspace.com</a> .

ZSIhEbpPaa	i recommend removing Kido worm manually, here's tutorial for that: http://www.spywarevoid.com/remove-kido-w...    and then you should download and install windows updates cos Net-Worm.win32.Kido.ih and similar threats spreads by exploiting vulnerabilities of windows operating system. i also recommend installing antispyware to prevent future infections. as you've already experienced, antivirus is not enough.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware.    Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, make sure your Virus scanner's database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	did u google it to see how   kaswpersky is great but it doesn't get everything and neither will norton   me i would use kaspersky support that is what it is there for and google ur virus|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Look for the files on your computer and remove them!

jQcQINEsaa	hi,  that's why you have saved the wrong file. ^^  You need to use File=>publish movie, not save project as.  MSWMM is a Movie Maker Project File.It's for quick re-editing projects.  But you need to use publish movie and have a file with wmv extension.Then upload the wmv file to youtube.It'll be ok then. ^^|`|d5989b135b6b0fe620f1b1d3a6d3d619aa	This link will help...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXK68NS7...    For other answers to questions about YouTube, visit http://youtube-answers.blogspot.com|`|AA11312040	You need to export your file out in a format that YouTube can transcode; .WMV (Windows Media) or .AVI.       From the YouTube Help Portal:    Invalid file format error' means that your video is in a format that our system doesn't accept. We accept most file formats, including .wmv, .mov, .mpg, or .avi. If your video meets these minimum requirements and still won't upload, it may be due to a problem with the video compression you are using. We recommend the MPEG4 (Divx, Xvid, SVQ3) format at 640x480 resolution with MP3 audio. Resizing your video to these specifications before uploading will help your clips look better on YouTube.    If you're using Windows Movie Maker, it's also possible that you tried to upload your .MSWMM file. This is not an actual movie file. An .MSWMM file is a Windows Movie Maker project file. If you're satisfied with your movie, choose the 'Publish Movie' or 'Save Movie File' option (depending on which version you have) under the 'File' menu and create a movie file such as .avi or .wmv.|`|AA11620962	Try changing the format to .mp4 or something that youtube has on their site, the file types should be listed on the site

FBQZ06vraa	The 25-character product key on the computer case or laptop bottom is NOT the key for MS Office.  Its only for the Windows operating system.    The version of MS Office you have is probably a trial version that will be good for 25 uses (of all Office programs) or 60 days.  After that, it will let you read and print your documents, but not much more.    Until then, you can use it by just clicking the Continue button on the registration page.    Here are some options for when it does run out:    First, if you're a student, you may qualify for the Student edition of Office at a pretty good price:    http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...    Second, if youre interested in buying Word, check out this URL, especially the second group of listings.     http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/produc...    Note that the higher of the two prices quoted is for a full version of that program and the lower, for upgrades from existing software.  Read the list of upgrade-qualifying software carefully:  MS Works is often one, and may have come on your machine.    Finally, if you have files that are locked up in the new Word 2007 file format (.docx), heres a possibility for salvaging them.  Microsoft offers a free Compatibility pack that allows earlier versions of Word to read Word 2007 files.  If you have access to an earlier version, this can at least give you back your documents.  Some new features of Word 2007 will be lost or converted to straight text in the conversion to the earlier version.    Good luck.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	The one on the side of the computer is for the operating system. Probably the Office version that came on on the computer was a trial version.

Presentation, excel .etc .etc  They're just named differently and a little bit different to operate.  You can still open microsft office .docs with it and save with it as well and open them back up at school or work with microsoft word.    Website is www.openoffice.org|`|NwnzUPc4aa	You got a Microsoft Office trial.  You can use limited features so many times without putting in the key.    The product key on the side of your computer is for the computer, not for the program.  The program is an entirely diffrent product.    The only thing you can do is to buy the product.  (Home and Office 2007 runs about $150).  There is no other option.  You are buying the product.  It is like getting a piece of exercise equipment off an infomercial on a free trail.  To keep the product, you have to pay for it.    Sorry.  Good luck.

Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

Your allowed only a few moments to press the required key before your operating system begins to load. To enter BIOS , turn on the PC and hold down, or press repeatedly, the key required to enter setup. On most Pic's this is the DEL key , the F1 key, or the F2 key,If your PC will not enter the setup using those keys and / or doe's not display the message described above when first turned on , you will need to refer to your documentation or contact your PC manufacturer for support.It is recommended you reboot after each individual BIOS change to ensure your system functions normally.If you make numerous changes before rebooting , and your system will no longer boot, you wont know which change is responsible for the failure.Once you have entered the setup main Options menu click on the Main Tab in the upper left-hand corner.Just below where you set the date and time.you can define the specifics for your hard drives and other storage devices stored on your PC Each time the PC boots,it most likely has auto - detect and determins which storage devices are stored on the system.While this only takes a  second or two on most systems.if you use these specifics rather than use auto-detection, your boot-up will be that much quicker. to do this simply select the drive,usually by highliting it  and pressing enter. then write down the numbers currently displayed,for the Cylinders, Heads, Sectors and LBA. On some BIOSes, you'll also have options for block mode as well as 32 bit Transfer mode. Change the drive type from Auto to User. Then Key those  numbers and options in EXACTLY as they were displayed. On most modern Computers,you will want LBA mode,Block mode,and 32 bit transfer mode all turned on for your hard disk drive, even if they werent before. If there is no device attached  to any one  of the four possible drive location combinations, Select None.be sure to set both the Primary and Secondary Slave options to none. If you leave the auto setting where there is no device, the computer will always look to see if a device is plugged in at the location each time the computer boots by changing this setting to none the computer wil boot slightly faster.Next select the advanced tab on the top of the screen to show advanced options, which are broken into sub menu's , The first branch is labeled "Advanced BIOS"features  Unless you suspect a problem with your memory and floppy drive every time you turn on the computer i see no reason to test them with BIOS diagnostics. To optimize the start-up process. Here are the recomended settings:Boot Virus Detection Enabled, CPU level 1 cache: Enabled ,CPU level2 cache:Enabled, Quick Power on self test: Enabled, First, Second, or Third Boot Device:Set your boot order, and disable any boot device here that you do not want to boot from, Boot other devices:Disabled unless your booting from a network or SCSI Card. Boot up Floppy Seek: Disabled its a waste of time and a noise maker.Boot up Number Status:Your choice some folks like the Number Lock on their keyboard activated when windows starts, while others want it disabled.Gate A20 options:Fast this feature was made obsolete by windows xp , I still recomend you leave it on.The only reason someone would set it to normal would be if they are running DOS. Typematic Rate Setting:Disabled. Your choice realy this feature determins how long the keyboard waits when holding down a key until it starts repeating it, and how fast that happens.APIC mode:Enabled this is the advanced programable  interupt controller, which is responsable for multiprocessor support.OS2/onboard memory>64m:Disabled this setting only applies to users running the now defunct OS2 operating system from IBM. Full Screen Logo Show: your choice, when enabled the memory-count ,and power-on, self-test (post) are hidden behind a curtain- a graphic logo. Post complete report:your choice when enabled will display the results of the post.Speech Post reporter: your choice this setting when enabled on PC with speakers, will "talk" over your speaker at boot time to tell you the status of the post. the voice quality is a far cry from that of the computers on Startrek, but some people think its cool.

UJHiCQu4aa	The difference between a regular optical mouse and a laser mouse is the light used to track movement. A regular optical mouse uses an LED light in the optical engine, while a laser mouse uses a laser to track movement. The more dots per inch (dpi) a mouse can track, the more sensitive and accurate it is. A typical optical mouse tracks between 400dpi and 800dpi, while laser mice track more than 2,000dpi.    Neither is really better; it all depends on your needs and preferences. Unless you're a gamer or a graphic artist with a need for precise movement, you'll probably find a 2,000dpi laser mouse too sensitive. Many gaming mice, however, allow you to switch sensitivity levels so that you have precision when you need it but can revert to 400dpi or 800dpi for regular mousing.    Besides their tracking speeds, laser mice work on nearly every surface, whereas optical mice may experience trouble tracking on black or shiny surfaces.     Invisible light sources in laser or optical mice have the advantage of not hurting the users' eyes in dark environments. The only disadvantage is that it is impossible to tell with the human eye whether a mouse is powered or not just by looking at the light source. Therefore, some mice that use invisible light come with LED indicators to show whether or not the mouse is powered on.    Originally, optical mice used red light for its tracking. Recently, optical mice started coming utilizing with light within the non-visible spectrum. Laser mice use invisible lasers.

Not all DRAM is created equal, there are different generations, such as DDR, DDR2, DDR3, and different speeds within each generation.  Your computer can only deal with a certain range of speeds, and only a single generation.

AA11688982	As an employer, I do not look for qualifications in IT staff. The current A+ Certification course is at least 10 years out of date!! Frankly the knowledge required to pass the course will not benefit either you or a prospective employer. I would skip the A+ and go straight to MCSE.    As for MCSE, I once employed someone who had 5 MCSEs (out of a possible 6 at that time). He spent 3 hours trying to work out why his PC would not switch on (on first day at work). The problem?? It was not plugged in to the wall. Exams are not everything!!    Your general ability, aptitude and approachability will be your greatest asset.

If you have a DHCP address, meaning that it's dynamically assigned, you should release and renew your IP address.    If you are on Windows XP, go to your control panel.  Find Network connections and open it.  Find the connection you are using, most likely "Local Area Connection".

Does someone look after your network? How many other people share this network? If two or more have the same fixed IP address then they start conflicting. If all the folks are close together one nontechnical way is to wait till you get the message, reboot and see who else gets the problem when you take back the address. Or if there are only a few, just check everyone's settings.|`|AA10304833	You'll need to investigate your network settings.  Check the properties of your Network, specifically the TCP/IP settings.  You'll most likely want to go with automatic settings...  This should be the default unless you or someone has changed it.  Some hardware on your network somewhere has a manually configured address that you're conflicting with...  And if you were on automatic this would assign you another, so you've most likely got two manuals configured conflicting...

AA10461578	Yes Spybot has both an immunize function as well as a real time protection called "Tea-Timer" The free version of Adaware does not.  I use them both (and more!)    New ad and spy-wares come out literally every few minutes, no single anti-malware is ever up to date enough to detect them all.    A great malware preventative to stop malware before your computer is  infected is SpywareBlaster 3.5.1     It  will help prevent the installation of ActiveX-based spy-ware, adware, browser hijackers, dialers, and other potentially unwanted software.   Block spyware/tracking cookies in Internet Explorer and Mozilla/Firefox.   Restrict the actions of potentially unwanted sites in Internet Explorer  Best of all it is free and uses no system resources. Get it from:  http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareb...|`|AA10625534	It's recommended to have them both, because if one fails in cleaning the spyware the other may get it.  You can try using Windows Defender from MS.|`|AA11255292	Spybot does have that protection and you have to go into the advanced setting a check the box for TeaTimer.    I recommed Windows Defender Beta 2, Yahoo Toolbar Ant-Spy, and Cyberhawk.    Then use AdAware and Spybot to just do scans with.    Cyberhawk will work with your AS and AV programs for an additional layer and works great. It has stopped 13 infections attempts in the 5 months I used it.    Windows Defender here: 1st red box    http://www.filehippo.com/    Cyberhawk here: No setup required. Download and Run.    http://www.novatix.com/Home.aspx    Yahoo Toolbar for IE or Firefox here:    http://toolbar.yahoo.com/|`|AA10816058	what one might miss hopefully the other will get, you might also want to look into windows defender it's also free and does have real time protection|`|AA11335118	The more anti-spyware programs you have, the better chance you have of getting spyware. For an example, if one program can't track it, the other one might. That's how it works.    Also, Spybot and Ad-aware are the best free ones so far.

On your PPT program, go to Inset on your toolbars and scroll down to Movies and Sounds. (Make sure you are on your first slide)    3. Select Sound from File and locate the sound file on your hard drive.     4. Once the music is loaded, there should be a little speaker that appears on the slide, right click that little speaker and go to Custom Animation.    5. In the Multimedia Settings tab, uncheck play using animation order, and check the bubble saying Continue slide show. Finally, check After __ Slides in the "Stop Playing" options and enter in the number of slides you have.     6. If the song is not long enough to last throughout the whole presentation, you can check loop until stopped in More Options.    7. Click ok. Now the music should play when you start the slideshow and end when you finish. Make sure that if you are going to bring this presentation elsewhere that you have the music file on that computer.|`|AA11825404	Just go to "Insert" and then "movies and sound" and choose where you want to get the music from.

Problems with this are: Some interests lists are huge, this trick really only works for folks with unique interests on *small* lists (think dozens to hundreds of members), with common interests you get too much crap.  And also, this only seems to work if your friend's yahoo ID starts with a letter close to the *start* of the alphabet (thank your typical abusive WebCammer/SpamBot for that one, for all their "a00000...hibbledeskibbledye" profiles).

AA10036593	This is a little bit hard to answer, since you give very little info about your system... That said, check the following:    1) Verify that you have internet connectivity... Usually, the command "ipconfig" works on most systems to indicate that you have a valid ip address, net mask, and gateway...  2) Verify that your DNS settings are correct... These are supplied by your ISP when you log on to the internet, and are necessary to translate the internet names (like mail.yahoo.com) to an actual IP address (like 209.73.177.115)  3) Verify that you can access the mail server via a "ping" or "tracert" command... just enter "ping xxx" or "tracert xxx" where xxx is your server's name and verify that you can get to it via the internet.  4) Verify the port settings... If you are using POP3 protocol this is USUALLY port 110, but SOME ISP's use alternate ports, or require higher security levels,,, Verify what your ISP reuqires, and  5) Make certain that all the settings in your email client software are correct... A simple typo here can bollux up the whole shebang! Spelling DOES count, and there is no spell checker to help!  If you are at all uncertain, get another pair of eyes to proofread the data for you to verify accuracy...

It is often described as "2.5G", that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate speed data transfer, by using unused TDMA channels in the GSM network. Originally there was some thought to extend GPRS to cover other standards, but instead those networks are being converted to use the GSM standard, so that is the only kind of network where GPRS is in use.|`|8d769e1bbf2faa465db6d896e9c1cd04aa	General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a mobile data service available to users of GSM mobile phones.

It follows unit testing and precedes system testing.

The same is now tested against real/simulated data. This phase is called integration testing

This is because uncompressed audio is alot bigger than MP3s.    If you want a CD full of MP3s (which won't play in a normal CD player), then you need to burn the tracks to a data CD rather than an audio CD - I don't know whether you can do this in iTunes, but most other software can do this.

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	An applet is a software component that runs in the context of another program, for example a web browser. An applet usually performs a very narrow function that has no independent use. Hence, it is an application -let. The term was introduced in AppleScript in 1993. An applet is distinguished from "subroutine" by several features. First, it executes only on the "client" platform environment of a system, as contrasted from "servlet." As such, an applet provides functionality or performance beyond the default capabilities of its container (the browser). Also, in contrast with a subroutine, certain capabilities are restricted by the container. An applet is written in a language that is different from the scripting or HTML language which invokes it. The applet is written in a compiled language, while the scripting language of the container is an interpreted language, hence, the greater performance or functionality of the applet. Unlike a "subroutine," a complete web component can be implemented as an applet.|`|c3dad62d954a3e0fb1d390901dc6c2b2aa	What is applet?first of all i am answering in simplest form....  ======================================...  Although Java is a general-purpose programming language suitable for a large variety of tasks, the task most people use it for is applet programming. An applet is a Java program that executes on a World Wide Web page.   --------------------------------------...  When the prerelease versions of the Java Developers Kit were made available in 1995, the demonstration programs that drew international attention to the language were applets. Your first experience with Java might have been one of these demos-spinning heads, the animated Duke character doing cartwheels, a dancing headline, and so on  --------------------------------------...  Today, applets are being used to accomplish far more than demonstrative goals. There are working examples of applets on Web sites throughout the Internet-a check of the AltaVista search engine finds more than 4,200 Web pages that have applets embedded on them.   --------------------------------------...  The current uses of applets include the following:     Tickertape-style news and sports headline updates   Animated graphics   Video games   Student tests   Image maps that respond to mouse movement   Advanced text displays   Database reports  --------------------------------------...  Following is an example of an applet tag:                 This applet requires the use of a Java-enabled browser!    --------------------------------------...  What about galaga?it is....  Galaga is Namco's classic space shooter for the arcade that gained popularity along with Pac-Man. Much superior to Galaxian, Galaga had side-to-side movement that was responsive, tight, and somewhat restrictive. Similar to Space Invaders, Galaga's enemies kept in formation as you blast them into oblivion, but with their superior numbers, they can easily overwhelm you with multiple swarms and a hail of gunfire. It's your job to defeat these enemies for as long as you can... at least until your wallet's empty.  --------------------------------------...  best of luck...................................r... muhammad|`|77a1e40be5831686a0358bd448bd9e47aa	A small program written in Java and included in a HTML page.

I go to this site and find text and photos of the war.  I can read the text and get some factual information.  Then I can look at photos and get a 'feel' of the times and experiences of those in the photos.  See the places that the text discuss and this can really make a topic come alive and become a lot more interesting.  Then I go to video.google.com and perform the same search.  Here I find all kinds of videos from propaganda to the final surrender of the Japanese in 1945.  Watching them again helps to place me in the context of the people of that time and I truly begin to understand what the world was like at that time.    Many sites will even link these different media.  So I can be reading about the surrender of the Japanese in 1945 which might read something like this;    ... the final surrender of the Japanese in 1945 (click here to see it) ...      and clicking on the word here links me to the video.  I can't demonstrate the link here as HTML tags do not function.

IE7 should automatically prevent add-ons known to cause problems from being installed. Currently if there is a problem, you have to test each add-on until you find the one(s) that are causing the problem.|`|ZRPtauraaa	I think it is.

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	Diskperf is a tool testing the performances of the disks subsystem.     I strongly recommend that you enable all disk performance data collection on any system where you care about performance.     Even if you don't care that much about performance, you should turn on Logical Disk reporting at a minimum. The Logical Disk Object contains two counters, Free Megabytes and % Free Space, which will alert you in advance to potential out-of-disk space conditions.     The diskperf measurement layer does add some code to the I/O Manager stack, so there is added latency associated with each I/O request that accesses a Physical Disk when measurement is turned on. However, the overhead of running the diskperf measurement layer, even twice, on Windows 2000 machines, is trivial. In a benchmark environment where a 550MHz, four-way Windows 2000 Server was handling 40,000 I/Os per second, enabling the diskperf measurements reduced its I/O capacity by about 5 percent to 38,000 I/Os per second. In that environment, we estimated that the diskperf measurement layer added about 3 to 4 microseconds to the I/O Manager path length for each I/O operation. (On a faster processor, the delay is proportionally less.) For a disk I/O request that you would normally expect to require a minimum of 3 to 5 milliseconds, this additional latency is hardly noticeable.    Besides, if you do not have disk-performance statistics enabled and a performance problem occurs that happens to be disk-related (and many are), you won't be able to gather data about the problem because loading the diskperf measurement layer requires a reboot.    In my view, you can only justify turning off the disk performance stats in a benchmark environment where you are attempting to wring out the absolute highest performance level from your hardware configuration. Of course, you will need to have the diskperf measurements enabled initially to determine how to optimize the configuration in the first place. It is standard practice to disable disk performance monitoring prior to making your final measurement runs.|`|c1a3b5ba51837338ef1572e22d49dfdaaa	look here:    http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=25325...

nmRZqyeoaa	Yes, quite often there will be.  Typically you will find them running there with the exception of rootkit infections which will show up looking like valid processes, because they have replaced themselves with the original process.|`|AA10654797	Sure it is. Many of them disguise themselves with windows process names tho.|`|AA11360207	It is possible, though most viruses or trojans are better hidden away.    Just be sure that if you mess with anything in the Processes, either to Disable or Remove, that you know exactly what you are messing with. If you mess with something that is system critical you can crash or corrupt your system O/S. The system may not function upon re-boot.    Good luck.

A lot of programs, especially the older games and such, only support one core, so will only use 2.4 GHz of it. Dual cores typically have more GHz per core, so the older apps run faster on duals. However, nowadays more and more programs are supporting multi-core CPUs.|`|AA10948208	Get the quad as more software will be needing it in the future.|`|9234c331d21e206bd81026b563696b09aa	as stated-dual and quad. there is one thing not mentioned. a quad core will allow you to run multiple programs, but it requires special circumstances.  it will allow you to run different programs simultaneously. it will not allow you to run a single program faster than a dual core, and not even faster than a single core on some programs. the program has to be written for the multiple cores. at this time it is pretty well restricted to gaming, and I know of no programs written for quad cores. they are expecting 8 to 10 core by the end of 2010.|`|I721A1RRaa	Duo, Quad and Octa are the latin words for two, four and eight.

SICEbszxaa	Yep, you can use Flash, or rather .flv, for Flash enableds your videos can be viewed on different operation systems and web browsers via the widely used Adobe Flash Player.    You can make a flash video from your video and embed it to a .swf file, then embed the .swf to your website.     However, if you are unclear these stuff, you can use Moyea web player lite - http://www.flash-video-mx.com/web-player...  which is a quick and easy solution to embed videos to web pages.

0e8683e307824097f636ebe10b48b6ecaa	Photoshop 7.0:    Photoshop requires at least a Pentium III-class processor, 128MB of available RAM, a video card capable of 8-bit color (256 total colors), and a monitor capable of displaying a resolution of at least 800x600 pixels. Realistically, consider at least 192MB of RAM (128MB for Photoshop, 64MB for the operating system) and a video card with at least 16MB of on-board video memory (VRAM). In addition, you'll likely want a monitor displaying a minimum of thousands of colors with resolution set to at least 1024x768 pixelswith the minimum resolution, you'd not be able to take advantage of Photoshop's Palette Well.    In addition to the hardware requirements, the operating system must be one of the following:    Windows XP  Windows 2000  Windows NT 4.0 (service pack 6a)  Windows ME  Windows 98 SE  Windows 98    Note that Photoshop 7 will not run on Windows 95.|`|44777b927a1aba1e49fe787ea69c87e3aa	Adobe Photoshop Ver-7

AA12088554	Most likely cause it a problem with the power supply by the BIOS error signal you gave (check the link below).  So it may be a more critical component than just the battery.  Especially if the system is having the same problems while plugged into the wall.|`|9093de6692223005aee5cc23526be087aa	I read about four of the responses you have received and if I were you, I would take my laptop to a reliable shop that specializes in laptops and have it checked. Not fixed but have it checked. Based on their diagnosis, you decide if you would fix it or get another one.    Good luck.    By the way, I have a strong feeling that your laptop doesn't start because the battery is dead and there is no full communication with the AC supply.|`|6193bc547cd74b5d2e6e0e47517d2e3faa	sounds to me like your memory needs changing|`|65921bae43c78282f4f3a072925834afaa	Then you cant read this answer anyway|`|f13c56892e11d84c2873b37622c95f9daa	sounds like the motherboard/bios is the problem, not the battery.  Even if the battery would barely holda charge, the computer would still run off the power supply.    When you turn a computer on and lights 'hang', that usually means it is the bios/mb, and your laptop is toast.    Try removing some of the hard drive, cdrom, floppy, some of the memory sticks, to see if they are causing the problem, what every can be removed. Re-start after removing each item. If you've removed what you can, and it still don't start, then start shopping for a new laptop.      good luck!

AA11626494	Yes it will work.  But you have to make sure that you set the jumpers correctly on the drives.    Sorry I can't find decent link with instructions on jumpers.  But basically, one has to be set to master and the other has to set to slave respectively.    You will find the jumpers on the back "MA", "SL", "CS"  Don't worry about "CS" (Cable Select)  that only usually used when you have a single drive.

It's intended for special HDMI ports that can output a VGA signal to connect to a VGA display.  It will NOT allow you to convert an analog VGA signal to digital HDMI.    If you want to connect to your monitor's HDMI port, you need a video card with either an HDMI port or a DVI port (yes, DVI is compatible with HDMI, by using a DVI-to-HDMI cable).

m13Se2dAaa	You don't install the font into Photoshop, you install it into your computer's system, then you can use it in all your programs. Here's a long explanation (because you didn't say if you are running Vista or XP)...    From the font site, click on download. Choose Save, not Open. Save it some place you can find it on your computer (like your desktop). I think you are this far already, so...    Find the downloaded file on your computer. You think it is a zip file, and it most likely is (.zip, .rar, .sit) so you will need to unzip it before you can do anything else.     WINDOWS VISTA UNZIP: double-click on the zip to open it, then either click on "Extract all files" or drag and drop the files somewhere outside the zip window.    WINDOWS VISTA INSTALL: Select the font files (.ttf or .otf ) from within the Extracted Folder or where you dragged then right-click > Install    WINDOWS XP UNZIP: You should have extraction software already on your system - try right clicking on the file and selecting expand or extract if it is listed. Have it extract to where you are or where you can find it.     If you do not have those choices, you need to download software - there are many free applications. I really like ExtractNow. It's basically Unzipping for Dummies ;-) Here is a link to a safe download from CNet. http://www.download.com/ExtractNow/3000-... It is free. It is easy to install. Once it is installed, you just launch it, drag your zipped folders into it and click Extract. It's great because you can extract multiple files at once.    WINDOWS XP INSTALL: Go to your fonts folder. Either through the start menu > control panels > fonts (make sure you are using Classic View for the control panels - it's much easier). OR go to My Computer > Drive C > Windows > Fonts. Drag the new fonts (just the ttf/otf files) from the extracted folder or wherever they are into the fonts folder. A box should pop up showing that the font is being installed.    FOR VISTA OR XP: If the download was just a single .ttf or.otf file, skip the extracting steps and go straight to installing.    The font should now show up in the font list of all your programs. If you have any programs running you will need to quit and restart them before they see the newly installed font. Worse case scenario - if the fonts aren't showing up, restart the computer.|`|L8XP51rdaa	After when you download fonts, go to C:\Windows\Fonts and place the fonts in the "Fonts" folder.|`|HYpnTH6baa	Go to Control Panel, and if you look (in classic veiw) you should see "Fonts" double click it and drag your font into that folder, you should see some form of progress bar and once that's gone away you should be able to use your font    If your font is in a zip folder just right click on the zip folder then press extract.

4rYDpMAgaa	Hello    Due to the rapid advancement of computer technology, all computers are considered old after 3 years.    Here is a maintenance procedure which often helps to speed up slow systems:    Computer Maintenance (Do this first)    This should be done before running ChkDsk (Check Disk, Hard Drive maintenance program) and Defragmentation (File and Folder organizer)    Clean up unnecessary files and folders first as soon as you start your computer (before you use any other program or application).    In Windows XP do a search for files that start with  ~$.    Click on Start, Search    Click on  All files and folders    Type  ~$*    in the All or part of file name field    Click on    More advanced options and make sure the first three  boxes are checked:   Search system Folders  Search hidden files And folders  Search subfolders    Click Search.  Highlight all the files found.  You can delete these files.  If there are some in use, the computer will not allow you to delete them.    Internet Explorer cleanup    If you have an Internet Explorer Icon on your Desktop without an arrow in the lower left corner you can right click on the Icon and left click on Properties.  (Internet Properties)    You may access this screen when in Internet Explorer by clicking on Tools, Internet Options.  (Internet Options)    Internet Options and Internet Properties are exactly the same screens.  They are shown side by side below.    First click on the Delete Files button.    Click the OK button.  This operation may take a while, depending on how many Temporary Internet Files are in the folder and the speed of your computer.    Next is optional; click on Delete Cookies.  (CAUTION:  If you use online banking or have to sign into secure website, they may have to be setup again).    Last is also optional; click on Clear History.  This deletes the list in your Address field of Internet Explorer.      Now run Chkdsk - this could take a few hours to run. (Best time to run this is when you are not going to use the computer for at least 3 hours.)    Restart your computer and do not open any programs.    Open My Computer    Right click on C:\ Drive    Left click on Properties    Left click on the Tools tab at the top of the Properties window.    Left click on   Check Now   by Error-Checking    Make sure the 2 boxes have a check in them.  Left click the boxes to place or remove the check mark.    Left click on Start.    A message bow will pop up stating  "the disk check could not be performed ...."    Left click on Yes.    Restart your computer.    When windows starts to load, a blue screen appear stating that a disk check was scheduled for Drive C:    Do not touch the keyboard - let it run.    You can turn off your monitor if you wish.    The computer will restart when it is finished.    Do not open any programs      Now run Disk Defragmenter - this could take a few hours to run. (Best time to run this is when you are not going to use the computer for at least 3 hours.)    Left click on Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk Defragmenter.    Left click on Defragment.    Close it when finished.      Good Luck|`|qcTVHEulaa	you might take it to a good teck and have him clean the insides and a good tune-up will find most, if not all of the problems that are slowing  your computer to a crawl|`|smFfcmYuaa	In theory the lifespan of computer equipment that has not been damaged or left in the kind of environment you're warned not to leave it in is many thousands of hours. If you've had it that long and it isn't making horrid noises (which is usually the hard drive wearing out) it's more likely that you've experienced computers which have greater performance in that time, and yours does not compare favorably. Which would make it seem like it's slowed down when instead it's your standards that have sped up.     In general 4 years is a pretty good mark to get new equipment if you can as costs will have plummeted exponentially and specs will have increased noticeably.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	It could be that it does not have enough memory for programs you have loaded onto it (virtual memory is when it has to swap memory back and forth to disk).  How much RAM does it have?    Have you ever defragged your hard drive.  Files added over time or logs can result in pieces of files scattered all over the hard drive.  Defragmenting can shuffle those files around so they are in consecutive segments on the hard drive to load faster.  That can take awhile if you have not done it for a long time, so you should do it when connected to AC power and your laptop set to not go to sleep (with screen saver temporarily set to none).|`|ffqsWfZtaa	All pc's slow down over time, partly due to windows updates, partly due to the ever increasing burden of anti-virus software. Not a lot you can do about that so concentrate on the stuff thats fixable.    Check your hard drive space, if its low (Less than 20% free) then delete some stuff if possible, also uninstall any software you no longer use.    Clean up your email if possible and run a compress on the folders, exactly how depends on your email program, usually under options somewhere.    Run a disk cleanup and then run a defragment a few times. (Accesories, system tools)    You can download a free tupe up program and try that if you like. I used TuneXP and it certainly helped startup and shutdown speeds.    Upgrade the RAM, when your machine was made RAM was very expensive, now its dirt cheap, try to upgrade to about 1gb, not much point in going over 2gb on that age of laptop.    A laptop will use less that a quarter of the power a dektop uses so its worth a wee bit of effort to keep it comfortably useable, my laptop runs full belt and charging at 40W, my desktops over 200watts not doing much, and can exceed 300W when i'm hammering it with games or whatever.

Below is an email message from Yahoo's Mail Abuse Team showing the correct ways to block spam in Yahoo Mail.    ? We understand your concerns about receiving unsolicited email, and can certainly empathize with your frustration. Yahoo! Mail offers several tools to help you keep spam out of your Inbox. To find the following tools (except "This Is Spam") click on OPTIONS in your mail account.      ? 1. "This is Spam" link -- The most effective way to prevent spam from entering your Inbox is to use the "This is Spam" link next to the "From" address in every message you consider spam. By sending examples of spam to Yahoo! for review, it will increase the effectiveness of Spamguard, Yahoo! Mail's filtering system. Yahoo! will use the messages you send to constantly improve the Spamguard technology and help ensure that unwanted messages are delivered to your Bulk Mail Folder rather than your Inbox.     ? 2. Filters -- Yahoo! Mail offers you the ability to create filters for your account. You can create filters to deliver emails to a special folder, or to the Trash folder that:     * contain specific words or phrases  * are from a sender's domain  * contain other characteristics you find in spam   ? Learn more about setting up filters at the Help Desk, located at:    ? http://help.yahoo.com/help/mail/manage/m...     ? 3. Block an address -- Use this feature to block email addresses you do not want to receive email from. When an address is blocked, incoming email from these addresses will be automatically disposed of, without bouncing back to the sender. When you remove an address from your Blocked Addresses list, you will once again be able to receive mail   from that address. For directions on how to block an email address, please visit:     ? http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/read/...    ? 4. Report the spam -- If you receive harassing or unwanted mail from what appears to be a "@yahoo.com" address, you can forward the message directly to us for review at:    a...@yahoo.com    ? Please include an unedited copy of the original message along with the full Internet headers. To learn how to display full headers in Yahoo! Mail, please visit:    ? http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/confi...    ? If you receive unwanted mail from a non-"@yahoo.com" address, you may try contacting the sender's email provider by identifying the sender's domain and contacting the administrator of that domain. Unfortunately, Yahoo! has no control over activities outside its service, and therefore we cannot take action in these situations. The sender's provider should be in a better position to take appropriate action against the sender's account.     ?

Right now, your e-mail address (along with millions of others) is on a CD being sold from the back rooms of software shops from Bangladesh to Botswanna and from Norway to the Netherlands.    However there are several things that you can do to prevent even more spam.    1. Start by removing your e-mail address from your Yahoo profile,if it is on it. The spam-industry has programs that are continusously crawling the web looking for the "@" symbol which is a sure sign the the word before it and the domain name after it is an e-mail address!    2. Use a longer address. The spam industry uses programs that try sending e-mail to all known domain names. Example: a program might start trying to send out e-mails to everyone starting with aaaaa@INVALID.com and continue down to zzzzz@INVALID.com. Using a longer e-mail address will make this harder to do.    3. Never click the "Unsubscribe Link" in any e-mail. This will only confirm to the spammers that your e-mail address is indeed real and that you are reading their garbage. In fact, do not even open any e-mail from anybody you don't know or trust. Many spams are not only annoying but contain viruses of other malware. Just delete 'em without opening 'em!.  You can however click that "Unsubscribe Me" button from businesses that are well known and that you trust. Walmart... yes. Someone selling Viagra...no.    4. Open up a second e-mail account. Whenever, a website requires you to register using your e mail address, use this secondary address. There are many unscrupulous websites that will sell you address to others or bombard you with spam themselves.    5. Download a free copy of SiteAdvisor. SiteAdvisor will alert you when you search (Google, Yahoo, MSN, search only) of websites that are known to send out spam, so you can avoid registering with those who do.    Treat your e-mail address just like you would your telephone number or home address....only give it out to those that you absolutely trust!|`|AA11966875	My best friend recently closed his account and opened a new one, sending all of his closest friends and collegues the new address, along with a letter explaining that he was fed up with the emails.      I've tried clicking on the "unsubscribe" things that are at the bottom of some of the junk mails, but not all are protected unsubscribes, I believe, and too many others have no option to remove yourself from their lists.    Be careful - don't give your personal information to anybody that you can't trust - especially people who like to use those "free ecard" sites - without warning them.  Then you'll have to use the email blockers for offending addresses.    Good luck.|`|e76905e466927a2b1a3d273967d5ccbaaa	there is a option in yahoo mail to block certain addresses for that u need to click the options and click block adresses and enter the e mail ids from which u dont want e mails  simple  pls award me 10 points|`|c91869876eb5b46dc40ad96a958c68fdaa	Somehow your mail account have become public.

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	A number assigned to user sessions and server applications in an IP network. The port number resides in the TCP or UDP header of the packet.    Source Ports  The source port, which can be a random number, is assigned to the client and is used to keep track of user sessions. The combination of port number and IP address is called a "socket."    Destination Ports  The destination port is used to route packets on a server to the appropriate network application. For example, port 80 is the standard port number for HTTP traffic, and port 80 packets are processed by a Web server. Destination ports are typically well-known ports (0-1023) for common Internet applications such as HTTP, FTP and SMTP. It can also be a registered port (1024-49151) that vendors use for proprietary applications.    Source Becomes Destination and Vice Versa    On the return trip response from the server, the destination port number and IP address become the source port number and IP address. Likewise, the source port and IP become the destination port and IP.      We're Listening    The software that responds to a port number is said to be "listening" for its packets. More accurately, the term should be "looking" for its packets, because it is comparing numbers, not "listening" to numbers.    An FTP conversation consists of requests sent by the client and responses sent by the server.   After the client connects, the server sends a response to the client, either accepting or rejecting the connection. This initial response is called the greeting.     If the server accepts the connection, the client sends zero or more requests to the server. Each request is handled as follows:     The client sends the request to the server.   The server sends one or more responses to the client. The last response either accepts or rejects the request. Previous responses are marks.    hope this helps|`|b4d8b5a9f70163970f356b9f7f42d70eaa	www.gadgetdetective.com|`|44278221d0b910f7e2de63fcd827b10eaa	A port is a socket in a computer where a communication or semi-permenant device is plugged in.

Some rooms are assigned to just certain conversations (ie FTP, POP3) whereas others can switch between rooms so the conversation is clear.    For instance, when you go to a webpage your computer and the web server need to have a conversation. Therefore, the websever will tell your computer to go to a certain room (port) so everything can be heard.

Some of those format that I know of are Mastroska Video (.MKV) and OGG Video (.OGM)    If that is the case, you need to have the software that can trigger the subtitle to appear like Haali or VobSub.    I do not know the condition of your PC and what codec/codec packs that you have installed, but you may want to try this.    Try to uninstall every codec that you remember installing into the PC. That also include codec packs. After that, please restart the PC and download CCCP from the link I provide below.    After that, install the codec pack (the pack comes with VobSub) and you should be able to view the video together with the subtitles using Media Player Classic that comes in the codec pack. If you are not able to view it, then look for a green arrow icon on your system try. Right click on it and you should see the subtitles entry there. Just choose anyone of them and you should be able to see the subtitle after that.    If that is not the cause of the problem, then I may need to have a chat with you or communicate through email. If you wish to communicate through email or through msn, just send an email to jsy3k@singnet.com.sg.    Hope that helps =)|`|OOTpd0Lmaa	You really need to mess around with the settings, there should be one for subtitles...|`|eGDekAzMaa	get this soft   divx.com|`|AA11932907	your mind is the key to the answer......

It changes every so often, but you cannot force it to change. The ipconfig /release and renew are only applicable to a LAN IP address and have nothing to do with your WAN IP address which is all this site recognizes.    The only way to try and "force" a change in your IP address is to power-off your modem for an extended amount of time (overnight). It's possible when you turn it back on you will be assigned a new IP address.    It may also help to clear out your cookies and CCleaner is great free program that will do this for you (it also removes all traces of your online activites).

In your example, the code that calls rand() and handles the result needs to be moved up so that it happens before the DOCTYPE and HTML stuff, and then you can use the header() function.  So the first thing in your file would be this (replace the URLs with the ones to your destination pages):        // random number 1 - 100  $result_random=rand(1, 100);    // if result less than or equal 70, display ad 1 (70%)  if($result_random    header("Location: http://ad1url");    exit;  }    // if result less than or equal 90, display ad 2 (20%)  elseif($result_random    header("Location: http://ad2url");    exit;  }    // if result less than or equal 100, display ad 3 (10%)  elseif($result_random    header("Location: http://ad3url");    exit;  }    ?>

RwgxhGMeaa	Go to and click the green start button at the bottom left of your screen. When that menu pops up, click control panel, which should be down about half way on the light blue shaded part of that menu. When that window opens, you should see Internet Options, the icon looks like a world with a notebook in front of it with 2 checks on it. Click that 2 times. A smaller window should pop up and  you should see browsing history... the icon looks like a clock with a green arrow pointing down. Click the delete button which is the left one in that section (browsing history). Another window should pop up and give you all your delete options. I would click delete all at the bottom, or delete only the selected items in that window.    Your version might be different than mine. But thats how it works on mine.

2SSA9e9Naa	You are right RAM can be erased and ROM can't (without proper equipment). The difference between memory (RAM or ROM) and hard drives (external or internal) is that memory is based on memory chips where are most drives are based on metal technology (and other components) that are used to store data.    All of them are doing the same thing but differ in how they do their job. Wikipedia has a really good definition of storage that may help use.    When talking about Computer instructions I think you are asking about the Bios, which is similar to ROM but stored in a chip that can be updated. Again with proper tools and instructions.    There are computer instructions, the basic "machine" level language that the processor knows how to execute. All software you run eventually gets distilled down to that at run time. That language is actually kept internal to the CPU itself (or how to process it is).    Hope that helps. Try these wiki articles as they give you really good information.|`|KpoR3MiQaa	RAM and ROM are to do with memory, and your external HDD is not classed as memory in computer terms, it is classed as storage, memory is the thing that the computer uses to process information along with the processor, your HDD dosnt do this    So it is neither|`|812793fbbb1f4d6a8b07ee04d74ebb7daa	http://www.zerocut.com/tech/c_terms.html|`|jL28ladCaa	and external hard drive isn't ram or rom.  rom is the working memory of you're computer.  adding more ram usually in general results in you're computer going faster.  rom is the memory that's burnt into you're computer that can't be changed.  it gives you're computer instructions on what to do when you turn on you're computer.|`|XeKvaOiBaa	Well, i should say its neither ROM nor RAM because ROM reads only memory which you cannot edit, delete or add and RAM can edit, add or delete.  RAM and external hard disk are almost having the same function except for RAM that memory only remain temporarily while the computer is switched on and loose when switched off. External HDD doesn't loose its memory even if the computer is switched off.
7vh5fOeRaa	The answer isn't dependent on your opeating system (Vista)... which key you use to enter the BIOS or to manually select a boot device is dependent on your hardware.    If you are using a desktop computer, most motherboard manufacturers do not use an 'F' key but rather use the 'Delete' key.  That is not 100% true for all computer makers, though, so you'll need to check with your vendor.  I believe Dell, for example, uses the 'F12' key to manually specify a boot device and the 'F2' key to enter the BIOS.    If  you don't have a manual, you can post your specific make and model of computer here, and I can probably find a resource that will tell me what keys to press to get you into your BIOS.|`|KpoR3MiQaa	It will be F12 AS SOON AS THE COMPUTER STARTS UP    dont let it boot vista first|`|dQTXenXiaa	eat my poop.|`|F4rD4HF0aa	F8 or F12 don't remember right now

Paid Surveys    4. PayPerPost.com - Get paid to post articles about different companies on your blog    The best one there is internet affiliate marketing, but it is also the hardest. You would need to learn how to do it and that could take up to 2 months before you even make a sale.

AA10654797	Back in the day, the old cathode ray tube monitors would etch the desktop permanently on the phosphor screen. Screensavers kept this from happening. Since then, most displays are now lcd and there isnt an issue with screen burn anymore. That being said, the issue is now relevant again with plasma displays which can suffer from image burn.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Plasma and CRT monitors can suffer from phosphor burn-in if a still image is displayed on them for a long time. When this happens, a shadow of the image is permanently "burned in" to the screen.    This isn't such an issue with the LCD monitors that are in widespread use now, but it can still happen. I have had a LCD monitor suffer from burn-in before.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphor_bu...    Screensavers are designed to prevent this by either blanking the screen, or displaying a continuously moving image. The savers included with early versions of Windows included starfields and moving shapes - the ones available today can be more sophisticated, but the purpose is the same.    Burn-in can be most clearly seen on old coin-operated arcade games such as Pac Man. When the screen goes blank or the game is unplugged, you'll see the dots and other elements of the maze burned as shadows into the screen.|`|7oAfdaROaa	screensaver is designed to prevent screen burn cause by cumulative non-uniform usage of the pixels.    Screensavers derive their name from their original purpose, which was an active method of attempting to stave off screen burn. By ensuring that no pixel or group of pixels was left displaying a static image for extended periods of time, phosphor luminosity was preserved.    In many cases the use of a Screensaver is impractical. Most plasma-type display manufacturers include methods for reducing the rate of burn-in by rotating the image slightly, which does not eliminate screen burn and but can soften the edges of any ghost image that does develop.    Cnet advises consumers to keep the contrast of their HDTV sets below 50% for the first 100 hours of use|`|Dgv3IEwXaa	in the old days of computers screens could actually go white or having an image burnt into the screen by being left on one image all the time (ie: the desktop). to prevent damage people created "the screen saver" to display moving images to prevent ghost images not burnt in the screen.    please note that these are for old glass tube monitors and you have no need to worry about your lcd as they are immune to burnt images, but now a days the purpose of the screen saver is just for entertainment now and serves no purpose any more.
RZQnxoF1aa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.
DjGEJfaPaa	It is possible to recover files with file recovery software. I reccommend Recuva (pronounced "recover"), it is a freeware Windows utility to restore files that have been accidentally deleted from your computer. This includes files emptied from the Recycle bin as well as images and other files that have been deleted by user error from digital camera memory cards or MP3 players. It will even bring back files that have been deleted by bugs, crashes and viruses!    There are two kinds of people: those who have experienced data loss, and those who will. Remember the 3 rules of computing. 1) Back up 2) Back up 3) Back up.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	In cases in which you accidentally empty the recycle bin, Recuva is a good option, but if you've actually reformatted your PC, I'd recommend a Linux live CD and Photorec to get your files back (don't be fooled by the name, as Photorec recovers much more than just photos):  http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/reco...|`|iQQtsGUoaa	If you are using Vista your file should still be on your hard drive. Go to the c: and look for a folder called Backup. when vista does a system restore it automatically backups up your important files, like word document and jpeg pictures.

GDxXxh46aa	I think you are asking how to get past the password screen that boots up when you first log into Windows XP?    First try all the obvious passwords, like just the word password, or even no password.    If it is Windows XP then you can boot it into safe mode.  Just keep pressing F8 when it is powering up and it will go into safe mode and you can access the files.  From Safe mode you should be able go to into control panel and change the password.    If that doesn't work, try building a copy of BartPE  http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/  on a CD and boot the CD, and you should be able to access the files on the hard drive.  You won't be able to run the programs, but you will be able to see all the files.

But, in practical terms, the answer is NO.  Forget about joe 6-pack kicking back on his PC and a beer budget from accomplishing this.  As far as I know, the CIA/ NSA and any other alphabet soup agencies are not going to give anyone but themselves the ability to task a satellite and do video on a sweep, lock on a particular location and stream video.  The details are still a national secret as they should be.  As far as commercial satellite imagery goes, that might be do able, but its going to cost you more than a pizza and a beer as costs per minute are measured in range of 1,000.00 us$ per second, or more.  A cheaper alternative would be to get your favorite general to agree to task a predator UAV to loiter over an area and stream video that way.  Who knows?  The targets in question could very well look up to the sky and wave to you.
