20090219225940AAkdc5G	Pets;Fish	Our plecos NEVER grow, anyone know why?	We have a 30 gal. fish tank with a few fish. One Bala, 3 silver dollars, and a clown loach, and of course a pleco. We've had these fish for about 3 years. All the fish are about 4-5 inches long, give or take some. Anyways, we can never get our plecos to grow. They stay the same size, maybe 2 inches in length. We've gone through about 4 of them since we had the tank for 3 years and they just eventually die. Any reasons why they don't grow. Thanks.

20090219234228AAqTcjU	Pets;Dogs	What do i do? our 6 yr old rhodesian doesnt want anything to do with our new puppy and is aggresive! help!?	So we lost our 5 yr old lab mix about a month ago and just got a new 12 week old lab/shepherd mix from a rescue. She is just like any normal puppy... wants to play all the time, very sweet, and a tad bitey, but thats to be expected. Well our 6 yr old rhodesian ridgeback completely hates the puppy. she doesnt attack the puppy every time shes near her, but when the puppy gets to close she will growl and she has nearly attacked her twice when there was food around. We got her a week ago, so maybe she still needs time to warm up, i dont know, but we're all really scared whenever they are near each other. we are always around to supervise because we crate them when we're gone, but still. how can we get our rhodesian to warm up to her? she has never really liked other dogs, but in her own pack she's been okay. help!

20090219232352AAEVBXI	Pets;Dogs	Litter training my puppy without him eating the cat poop?	Yes, I know this is strange, but the truth is, it's happening in my house and I'm not sure how to rearrange things in order for it to work. All over the place, small dogs have been taught to use a litter box with little to no problems. We have a 4.5 month old puppy who will never get to weigh more than 12 pounds, so the litter box is great. We live on the 5th floor, so sometimes walking outside is a problem. Anyway, long story short, our puppy is litter box training and while that's fine and dandy, he uses it 95% of the time, the biggest concern we have now is that we have one litter box shared between our cat and dog. Both use it as they should, except the puppy has this disgusting (but very common) habit of eating the cat feces as soon as she's gone potty. Most of the time, we can scoop it up and get rid of it before the puppy has a chance to notice, but sometimes we're not that fast and by the time we get up to scoop it, he's dragged out some and is munching on it on the carpet floor. Either that, or he'll go in after it's been scooped up and eat the litter that still tastes like the poop. They share the same box. We can't really put the cat's litter box in a different room. Due to our heating and air conditioning, using a separate room for this is impossible because the doors are always closed. I thought about using the larger box that we have with taller sides (the puppy can't get into this box) but then our cat will just go in that box and thus, the problem will start all over again. Is there any advice anyone can offer? It'd really be appreciated.

20090220004758AA4zgtH	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat seem more aggressive after spay?	I have a 3 yr old female cat who just 3 weeks ago got spayed. She was a very lovable cat, but after her first heat became a bit moody. She doesn;t like anyone coming to our house unless she knew them from when she was a kitten. Howevere she always tolerated strangers coming into our house before. She would hiss and growl at them if they tried to bother her or pet her. Since I got her spayed she seems to be more aggressive. Now when someone rings our doorbell or knocks oin the door, she begans to growl, hiss and act as if she is going to attack. I called the vet about it, and she said she was in heat for 3 yrs, and may take up to 2 months for hormones to leave her system. i have never heard of that? Does that sound right? She also seems to be alot more jumpy to sounds, and when she gets scared she seems to lash out and try to attack our other cat. I told the vet that we have also been afraid of her since she has been more aggressive, and said that she can pick up on our fear and that maybe causing her to be more jumpy. I don't know how true that all is, does it all sound right to any of you that have cat experiece?

20061228121100AA0As6F	Pets;Dogs	Okay to have 2 female Italian Greyhounds (if from same litter?) or will they always fight for dominance?	I've been doing a lot of research on Iggys (and I still have a lot more to do!).       I've read that it is okay to pair male/female and even 2 males, but as I prefer female animals, I was hoping to adopt 2 females (together or individually).      I assume that as long as I (their female "human") would establish dominance/ alpha status over BOTH female Iggys, that there shouldn't be much of a problem, as I've read consistently that Iggys are submissive.      What do you think and what exactly is your experience level with Iggys? What is the best way to pair two females, should I take on the challenge (if there is one)?      Thanks.

20070720191822AA0wjJ1	Pets;Dogs	Help I think my dachshund is pregant. I don't know what to do!?	I recently was given a 5 mth. old dachshund puppy (male) & I already had a 3 1/2 year old female dachshund. They have been playmates for about a month & a half and I always watched them and they never seemed interested in eachother.. and I never saw the male puppy hump my female. But today, my female was arching her back in a wierd way so I took her on a walk because I thought she was constipated. She was also shaking a little bit. I layed her down on the couch and petted her for a long time and I squeezed one of her nipples to see if she was producing milk and a little bit of clearish liquid came out. That really upset me. I do think she is pregnant and I am soo scared. She is my favorite dog that I have ever had. How many puppies to dachshunds have? If she is for sure pregnant there is no way I will let her have them the natural way at home.. way too stressful and I love her too much. I will definately schedule a c-section. Please help me if anyone knows anything about pregnant dogs!

Also, how much do they earn a year? Is it a proffesion with many drawbacks or perks? I LOVE animals, so being a vet would be a great experience. Currently, my friend and I have a business where we sell greeting cards and donate the money to animal shelters. We both want to be vets, and were wondering if it is a good idea to partener up and have a clinic together. Maybe in two different places in the U.S. What do you think? This is our website if you want to know more about us. (I draw the cards) Thank you for all your answers!!! www.sandrshelterhelpers.com

Hi everyone,   I am quite worried about my gelding, he has strange scabs on his mouth (lip area) and around his nose, they nearly look like growths. At first i thought he had badly scratched himself because he had little cuts where the scabs were, but now i think the cuts are a result of the scabs forming. Can scabby mouth form in horses too? or is it something else, i have no idea. It's not effecting his eating or anything, but it certainly doesn't look very pleasent. Please help me!i have no idea if it is serious or not. thanks
20070629133816AA6A8X2	Pets;Dogs	HELP! Housebreaking Yorkiepoo NOT going well!!?	Have 4 month old Yorkipoo who stubbornly insists on peeing and pooping on my persian rugs.  I've tried positive reinforcement with treats and praise when she does her business outside and scold her when she messes in the house.  I keep her in the crate overnight and take her out first thing in the morning and periodically throughout the day.        She will poop outside (twice) and immediately come in and within 10 minutes poop on my rug or the floor.  Doesn't really have a "favorite spot" -- anywhere will do.      Yesterday, I bought a doggy diaper for her to wear while running around the house and she somehow managed to squeeze a couple out without soiling the diaper.       I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!!!!

20081101073422AALmRdK	Pets;Horses	Neutralising urine/ammonia smell?	One of my horses wees a lot (no medical problem, he just does!) and as a result his stable smells a bit. He is turned out through the day and his stable is fully mucked out every day. However, the rubber matting gets wet with urine. What will neutralise the odour? I'm looking for something I can use on a day to day (or week to week) basis, and something natural. I take his mats up and pressure wash with disinfectant regularly but I obviously cannot do this every day. Will lemon juice, white vinegar etc help (all the usual natural neutralisers!?)?   Any help appreciated!

20081109031006AAaJlR7	Pets;Horses	Hoof Disease. Thrush?	I had an old Arab a few years ago along with a gorgeous, young pony - both in amazing condition! We sold them, due to my own stupidity, and I saw him (The Arab) for the first time in years! He has lost a lot of condition since we sold him, I don't think anybody ever loved him and cared for him as we did, but now he is relatively skinny, covered in allergy-lumps and his feet are really bad!   What I am mainly concerned about though are his feet:   They were spongy and soft around his frog, particularly around the bulbs like he has been sitting in water for the past few weeks, and the central sulcus of the frog runs far between the bulbs, right up to the back of his heel. I only picked up one hoof, but I can only assume the rest are very similar. I have done some research, but nothing seems to fit his symptoms...   When I explained it to a friend, they thought it might be Thrush? I'm not sure, I will definitely have to go back and see him again, and this time I will take a photo, and maybe a short video demonstrating the squishiness of the frog.      Thanks, in advance!

Ok, My cat of 1 year was attacked by a coyote just a hour ago, I went outside after hearing some hissing, and when I went outside, I saw a coyote attacking my cat, and mind you my cat is pretty big.. so anyways, the coyote saw me and started running off with my cat in its mouth, and I started chasing it, and yelling at it very loudly, finally it let go of my cat at the end of the drive way, and I kept yelling in the pitch black because I wanted to scare the coyote away, so I saw my cat sitting there, and I took it back in the house, its fine right now, it has a few bite marks and cuts, but none of it at all serious.  I am just scared it might have rabies.      What are the chances of coyotes having rabies In california?  if it had rabies, wouldn't it attack me?      Thank you all for your answers.

20090203120002AArHPOn	Pets;Horses	Do you think I should sell my horse?	My horse is not the way he acted when I looked at him to buy. He acts up all the time. He won't let anyone take off his halter when in the pasture. I think I should sell him; despite of how much I love him. My dad says he could have been drugged before I bought him, to calm him. He also says something could have happened at my house with him. His friend says he could sell for double the price. We are going to lunge him and try to put the saddle on this weekend. If that doesn't work out, we are going to have to sell him. I am an Adv. Beginner in english and his old owners said he was for adv. beginners and intermediate riders. He is not a good horse for me. He is so beautiful too. My mind is open and I will never buy from ads again... If I sell him, shouldn't he go to and advanced rider and trainer so he can be set straight? I have TB/QH on my mind for me anyway. My dad is very controlling and he says I made a mistake buying him. But I had 2 advanced trainers with me! I don't think I made a mistake buying him because we all learn from our mistakes, especially when horseback riding.

This little guy walks and circles A LOT so even if he starts on the puppy pad all of the poop ends up else where. He never poops directly on them. Sometimes he doesn't even try to start there. Well I got over the fact that this isn't my house and if the owners want an untrained dog and to clean up after it all the time that's there choice not mine. Both me and the vet have offered different training methods and advice but they just don't care. Don't follow through. What I can't get over - He had starting peeing and pooping directly outside my door. Straight across the hall is the bathroom. Most of the time I leave the room it's just two feet to the bathroom. Now I have to open the door, check the floor, check AGAIN because the carpet is brown and I've looked and still stepped in it on accident, then I go to the bathroom and when I leave back to my room I have to check, and check again. Since I can't always see the pee I wear slippers. I've gone through bottles and bottles of cleaners made to take out pet smells and stains such as Nature's Miracle. The thing that made me come on here for advice is he has started using the bathroom floor to go as well. We hardly even use bath mats on the floor because I'd be constantly washing them and buying new ones. Nothing is more gross them stepping out of the shower all nice and clean and stepping in urine. And the thought of it possibly dried over night is gross too. Is there ANYTHING I can put on the floor in the bathroom on the carpet on the door frames to just keep him AWAYYYY!!!!! I can't potty train this dog either. I'm hardly around him. Please help!!! The bedroom and bathroom doors are in the middle of the hallway so I can't block it off and there is not enough room for a puppy pad. I though about putting a puppy pad in the bathroom but once you put it in there it takes up all the floor space (it's a really really small bathroom).

20090220021140AAFO4kS	Pets;Dogs	Were you ever afraid of animals?	I was, I had a particular fear of a certain breed but I was terrified of animals for a large period of my life.   Dogs (I couldn't go for walks with other peoples dogs because if we saw a dog I didn't know I'd panic), cats ( I hated them), horses (scared me), mice (made me feel like vomiting) and that was really up until a year ago.   Now, I love all animals, have two dogs and two cats (getting another cat to foster for a few weeks tomorrow) and love animals MORE then most people (It's made me fearless in my regard to animals, and has turned me vegan).   Has this ever happened to you or someone you know?

Is it just that cats are considered disposable and that's why there are so many more?

I see ppl on here all the time recommending an x-ray over US but do  not know why.

Then I show her a treat, she will come to me. I will quietly show her the bridle. Sometimes she is reluctant to let me put the bit in. I have found that if I am really quiet then she will do it better (she is very headshy)      Then the saddle - it is a relatively new problem. I have had her for about a year now and for the past 2 months whenever i try to put her saddle on she will throw her head up. She will not bite me but she will toss her head and lay her ears flat back. Once the saddle is on, she is absulotely fine, she does the same with the girth.   I dont think she has any back problems, because i can put a lot of weight on her back without the saddle and she is fine.      What could be wrong!?!? I feel so bad! She is great to ride and would never buck/be naughty..

20090203121914AAU9qVC	Pets;Rodents	My hamster was acting crazy last night. Is this normal?	Last night at like 2 am when I was trying to go to sleep, my hamster Layla (She's a little over a month old and I've had her for 8 days) started acting crazy. I've never seen her like this before. She was running around like she'd just eaten 5 sugar cookies and chewing on her cage bars! She climbed a little too. She kept looking at me with these pleading little eyes like "Play with me!!" (Though I'd spent a lot of the day with her) and when I went over to the cage she kept trying to stick her face through the bars and escape. I opened up the door and she tried to climb into my hand twice. (She hadnt done that all by herself yet) I thought that chewing cage bars was a sign of boredom? Well, she has a lot to do in her cage. An igloo house, a wooden chew toy playground, tubes, a wheel, food, water. Why did she do this? I know they're nocturnal, but I've been up late like that before and she's just been eating in her igloo or sleeping.   She was also very twitchy. A little tiny movement I would make would make her jump or run away.   Would this have anything to do with her cage being cleaned for the first time yesterday...? Did it scare her possibly?

I'm not sure what to expect from this mix, I've researched both these dogs separately. What do you think the pros and cons might be? Also, everyone keeps saying that they are such ugly pups :(    Do you think they'll grow up to be ugly? I think they are beautiful, I just would like to know what he might end up looking like      Pics:       http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...        http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...        http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...        http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...        http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s... 
20090220005230AA3okPq	Pets;Fish	Are my clown fish too young to spawn?	I purchased two Occelaris Clown fish recently and they acclimated easily.  I recently caught them mating in the back of the tank by their anemone.  They were moving around each other and making quivering movements for a good ten minutes at least.   They are only 1 1/4 - 1 1/2in in length so they are still young.  I was wondering if they are capable of spawning successfully being so young and what I should do to prepare for it? Thanks
20090220005406AAKGz8a	Pets;Dogs	My puppy has began being aggressive towards other dogs, and excitable urination.?	I am sure this question has been asked before but I would appreciate the answers. Originally my 3 month old puppy loved other dogs, would lick their faces. He would get a little excited, but we were working on his manners. Although recently a loose dog attacked my other dog, and he attempted to protect her. Needless to say after this altercation he wasn't the same. Now every time he sees another dog he pulls on the leash, starts breathing heavy, and barking. Now before I was aware of the effects of the altercation I let him, and my other dog off leash at a dog park. He started jumping on the dog, chasing it, and barking. It was most likely only a matter of time before he began biting. The dog wasn't aggressive, in fact it was very submissive and well-behaved. My other dog had no problem with it at all too. He even went so insane he escaped from his collar, then wouldn't come when called. Now in a month he is being neutered, and we are going to enroll him in puppy training after his last bout of vaccinations. Although, I have read that the first four months of a puppy life are key, so I want to continue to socializing him. He is going to be four months in a matter of days, are there any tips you can give me to allow him to socialize without him being aggressive, or even eliminate his aggression. Another problem he has always had is when he meets new people he gets so excited he pees on the floor or on the person. I know he doesn't know he is doing it so I don't punish him for it. I attempt to make him sit, but he squirms so much he gets up and pees. I have no idea how to stop this, if you do please let me know. Thank you for the answers, I apperciate it immensly.

20090220015328AA0jP5o	Pets;Cats	Has anyone used Interferon  on their cat?	My lovely little cat Louis was diagnosed with Calicivirus as a kitten. As a result he has had reoccurring Stomatitis for the last 5 and a half years of his life. A few years ago, on advice from the vet, we had most of his teeth removed to try to control this condition. He has also been on long acting steroids that seem to help him tolerate the condition for about 6 to 8 weeks.       I recently moved house and got a new vet who suggested that we try him on Interferon. I am very aware that long term use of steroids will not do him good and I am very keen to make his life as comfortable and long as possible. So I agreed to try the Interferon, which was prescribed along with Metacalm to reduce pain.       We have been trying the Interferon for about a month now. The vet advised us to squirt it from a syringe directly into his mouth. This is proving to be extremely difficult because his mouth is quite inflamed still from the Stomatitis so any contact hurts him. He then wriggles and we often don't get it all in his mouth. This is of course extremely distressing for Louis which I want to avoid.      Has anyone used this drug before and found an easy method of administration? Last night I coated a teaspoon with cream and then squirted the liquid onto the spoon which he licked off. But I have read that food should not be mixed with Interferon because it reduces the efficacy. Do you think such a small amount of cream will make a difference?       Any advice will be gratefully appreciated. Thank you

20090220021739AAQYFEu	Pets;Cats	Will these arrangements be ok for my cat?!?!...HELP!?!?!?	Ok, so I'm getting a cat. He's a tabby cat and is just under a year old.      Firstly, I would like to say that I live in England and in England we always have inside/outside cats. There are no preditors, and it is just culture so if you are going to tell me to keep my cat inside then I'm sorry but I'm not going to do that.       There is nowhere to put a catflap in my house so I thought maybe these arrangements would be suitable. But I'm not sure. Please tell me what you think.      In the morning I will feed it and then I will let it out at 9:00am (when I go to work). I will leave the door from the conservatory to the garden open (but the door from the conservatory to my hosue will be locked) so the cat can get back to a shelter if he wants to. Don't worry, there will be nothing of value in there. Just an old rocking chair and some comfy cushions. Of course I will put his food, water, and toys in there as well.      I will come home at 3:00 and let the cat inside the house with me. And I will play with it and give it love and affection and in the evening I will feed it again. Then, when it's time for bed, I will put him in the conservatory. (With the door to the outside locked, and the door to the house locked). Because I don't want the cat wondering round the house at night when I am not there to watch him becasuse I have a hamster in my bedroom, and he could sneak in there and try to kill the hamster.      Would it be ok in the winter in the conservatory for him? It has no radiators or heating. Will it be warm enough? Also is there anything else I should think of. I just want to give him the happiest, healthiest life possible, whilest being practical.      Please, please, PRETTY please, give me some advice!      Thanks so much,       XD XD XD XD XD
20090220022551AA3HEsJ	Pets;Cats	Why is my cat constantly crying after being spayed?	Hi,I had my female cat spayed 2 days ago,she's wearing an e-collar so she doesn't pull the stitches out..can it be because of the collar and the discomfort ? or is she just upset ? She wants affection but won't sit on my lap for longer than 2min and then walks off and starts crying..is it better to keep her alone in one room for now ? It's breaking my heart ! She doesn't look like she's in pain,eats normally so don't know how to make her feel better ! Thanks for your suggestions..

He SCREAMED, fidgeted, scratched and wouldn't let me brush his teeth. When I finally calmed him down enough to do it, his gums bled near the new teeth.   Is the teething why he wouldn't let me brush?   He's only 12 weeks old.

A friend of mine from college is giving my little brother and me a pure breed Jack russel pup in about a months time. it's the cutest little thing in the world. However, my brother (8y/o) will be primary carer because I live in college mid-week and so he will get to name it (!). i want a few suggestions that my brother will love and wont be able to say no to so that the dog will have a decent enough name.    Its a male dog   My brother wants to call him Cathal (pronounced Caw-Hal) which is an Irish boys name but i think our neighbour Cathal might get offended. any cute but not too cute suggestions? but not rugged or manly suggestions either.
20090220025347AAHmcJI	Pets;Dogs	Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever?	Since we could not decide which one to get, we are currently thinking about getting one of each. My family has never owned a puppy before, and if we screw up, having two will mess us up even more. However, the thing I want you to know is that we have the money to look after them both. I have 3 siblings and my parents, which is six of us, to look after two dogs. Three people per dog seems pretty good. Anyways, what I wanted to ask was if we got one of each, would it be better because they could keep eachother company for a while if we were not around? Also, should we keep two puppies in the same crate? I am almost certain the answer will be no, but I am just wondering. Finally, I want to know whether labradors and goldens are noisy breeds, or quiet breeds. At night time, both will be sleeping inside. And after getting about an hours JOG every day, plus family play time, will they happily fall asleep, or struggle to sleep? Thanks for your help. P.S, is obedience classes really neccessary if you know you can effectively train the dogs at home? Thank You.
20090220031508AA2nHN8	Pets;Cats	Kitten who just seems odd/off?	Yes he has a vet. I pay the vets car payment ( or seriously close to it ) every month so don't think he hasn't been. Vet says "he's a little different, leave him alone." She doesn't live with him and his "oddness" bothers me. He's a hand fed, Mommy worries.    Carmel is four months old. I got him from the engine block of a truck, in October, nearly dead. He is now the picture of health but I think he may be a "bit off?" You tell me what you think.      I have several other cats. Though Carmel has been here since he was just a few days old none of them will have anything to do with him, at all, and normally they are very social my cats, even with strange animals. They look at him like he has three eyes and avoid him like he's a retard or something. And he makes no effort to have anything to do with them either.      He plays fetch. As long as he can see what he's fetching he plays, but if he loses sight of it it's over, it's as if he has limited comprehension. If the ball goes under something or around a chair leg he won't go after it once he loses sight of it. You go and get it, he goes nuts for it when he sees it again. When you leave the room and immediately come back he runs to you as if he hasn't seen you in days but he won't go looking for you in another room. Just as with fetching, if he loses sight of you, you're just gone, the end. His bowl has to be in the same spot always, and it has to be the same bowl, or he doesn't eat. He only eats one brand of kitten food or he doesn't eat, literally, and he eats nothing else. No table food, nothing. I've tested this. I put down four bowls containing cat food, all different, he goes right for that same bowl every time. If I put down four different kinds of food, he goes to his normal food every time. But if his bowl is gone and HIS food is gone he walks around and screams, and he eats nothing..I have let him do this for a full 18 hours...and he will not eat.     Loud noises don't affect him, never have. He will sit ON the vaccum cleaner or the shampooer. If something heavy hits the floor behind him he doesn't flinch. I have never seen him startled by anything, ever. For the longest time we thought he was def. And when you call him, unless he can see you, he will not come. You can call him from another room all day long, rattle the food bag, whatever...no response at all. And he only responds to me, period. He sleeps with me, follows my feet, sits on me, etc... Other family members he just doesn't even seem to notice. They call him, nothing. They try to play with him, nothing. They pick him up, he squirms and runs.     I've had a lot of cats in 39 years. I've had a lot of cats who were spoiled and God knows I'm good at spoling them. But I've got a DAY ONE hand fed who, though she's completely rotten, doesn't act this way.     Last but not least is his size and his eyes. He is super tiny, has been since I got him. He's stocky but short and petite. Vet says he is the size of a normal 6 to 8 week old by her calculations. His eyes JUST started changing color from that pretty blue about a month ago, at 12 weeks. Now, they are grey...absolutely, solid grey, like gun metal grey....and they reflect funny. When light is reflected in his eyes, whereas most cats eyes flash green or yellow, his are no color at all, it's just as if you're seeing an opague lens.     He's got to go to his vet Tuesday because I keep harping about these things and because he needs shots and a check-up. Give me some ideas to bounce off of my vet. Have you ever experienced any of these things with any of yours? Do you know of any way to test cats for such things as comprehension skills, hearing, etc?
