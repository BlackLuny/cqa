Don't be so racist.<br>  ----------------<br>  Edit: Hi.  The Sudan war is a proxy war of extremist Islam vs. non extremist factions trying to stop the takeover.  Islam has 60+ countries now some are victims of Achmedinejad and some are not.  Don't know who's who because they all look the same to you?  I just told you who's who.  Sudan isn't a black issue it is a radical Islam issue.

xU7AaQOdaa	Duchess- that is truly sick, but as Michael rightly says, we are in danger of being "numb" to all the in-humane stories that seem to bombard us on a daily basis. Examples:- name the last 3 British Soldiers killed in Iraq? What were the names of 2 of the people killed in the Lahore tragedy?<br>  <br>  "No Man is an Island", but sometimes the bell rings so often we just ignore it.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	In my heart I feel that in the past it was probably more prevalent. That's just a feeling though. How can we know the statistics of the past if it wasn't recorded?<br>  <br>  I remember the 1970's when some things were still a bit behind in my town. I remember visiting a friend at his home, which was a really ancient run down building with outside toilets. It looked Dickensian. The whole building stank and the surroundings looked like vermin were rife. It took council action to gut that place and modernise it. Prior to that they were just forgotten people. Anything could have happened there.<br>  <br>  Sadly, I visited another part of the town recently, that had been new in the 1970's. The area has been allowed to deteriorate due to neglect from bad tenants and the council. It's as bad in a way, but at least I know that social work and others are in there doing things for people.<br>  <br>  I know that to be a social worker takes much more training and skill than it did in the 1970's. We hear all the bad stories, but I think they probably do a lot to help prevent some of the abuses that might otherwise happen.<br>  <br>  A lot still needs doing to educate people who turn into abusers and to create healthier places for people to live.|`|RKUrIHI5aa	A mixture of the two. The prevalence of technology-based media and more enquiring minds with more vociferous public demands for justice have made them almost an every day occurrence. But still they happen - why????|`|Uz16kQEYaa	OMG how sad.But,as you say,it's like everyday news now..Shocking but true x|`|iNfkLWkNaa	These appalling cases seem unending nowadays but I don't think that child abuse is more prevalent;  in previous centuries children were treated appallingly as a matter of course.  However, there was not the media we have now to report the scale of it.<br>  The same applies to incest, which is not a new thing at all but was always hushed up.  Nowadays we hear about it but I doubt that it's more prevalent.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	We hear about it more.  Years ago abuse was allowed to continue and there were a lot more people who were allowed to abuse positions of trust.  The child, if they went to their parents or another adult were usually told to keep it quiet and abuse was kept within the family.<br>  <br>  Now children have more of a voice and there are checks done to make sure that people who work with children aren't a danger to them.<br>  <br>  Beating up your kids years ago was termed 'discipline' no matter how far you went, now a days its called abuse|`|s8nPN7pVaa	I think that the level of abuse remains fairly constant, but with more social awareness more of it comes to light and media coverage informs us with greater accuracy.<br>  <br>  Sad though it is, we still only see the tip of the Iceberg.<br>  <br>  Again, sad though it is we are becoming desensitised to child abuse as well.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	Having recently read several biographies that were about famous people growing up in the 50's - 90's who were abused by their parents and other family members, it has been going on a long time.  People are more protective towards children these days and if children tried to 'tell' children were not listened to and adults turned a blind eye to it.  Thank God people are more aware of it now|`|SBpl494Uaa	That story is just terrible. It is just so unbelievable people could be so cruel to another person, never mind they're own son. To answer the question, no I think we just hear about this kind of thing more.<br>  <br>  I hope this kids parents rot in hell, idiots.|`|eUuFPJAFaa	I highly doubt that there is more child abuse now than there was 100 years ago when it could go on so much more undetected, but with the media and the culture of freedom of information we hear about everything more - not just abuse.<br>  <br>  Sad story :(|`|b8tgCAQJaa	There's no evidence that it's more prevalent. We just hear about it more - in the past, cases of abuse were taboo and were often hushed up, whereas nowadays they're very prominent in the media.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	With more laws in place, it makes sense that we are hearing about things we now consider wrong to do to children than much earlier where we saw it as ok to put children to work or to employ the harshest measures of corporal punishment.|`|tN9KO8BLaa	Well it depends on what people consider child abuse. In the link you provided, I would definitely call that abuse. However, now days, you can innocently spank your child for doing something wrong and the authorities will be called and you will be on headline news. It seems that you can even be considered cruel if you yell or even punish a child in any way anymore.  I think because we have access to news around the world that is updated at all hours of the day, we think it is happening more. <br>  <br>  Kids used to be hit with a belt and paddled in school and no one even questioned it. The kids learned right from wrong and grew up to be productive citizens.|`|9ZCLZXZyaa	Another reason we hear more about it is that we have finally recognized that it is a serious problem that affects many people - not  just the victim and their family.   In the past, it was a secret and very shameful.  The victim was often blamed for letting the abuse continue. People see it as a crime that must be punished now.|`|cKtyAmATaa	I think it is made public now, where as years ago, it was a dirty secret. Most people know at least one person who was abused as a child! I think neglect is becoming prevalent as many parents are sky high on cannabis and searching for their next fix, instead of caring for their children.|`|0XjhIGd4aa	That is a sad story . Child abuse has always been around it was just something that was never talked about and accepted as normal by some . Plus  the victim hid it as they were made to feel it was something to be ashamed of and that they caused it .|`|Qmrqifvcaa	I gont think there is any more today than in the past like you said you hear about it more these days, and about being shocked, this is a sick world we lve in and it seems harder to be shocked by what happens day by day.<br>                                                Jim|`|bNvChlo9aa	About the same, but for different reasons. It used to be acceptable but hushed up but usually not as bad, and now it's due to uneducated people who have their own problems. And yes, we hear about it more.|`|ARG0OoFvaa	there is no rug to sweep it under these days, believe me, it happens less but we hear about it more!!|`|26t0dbQ5aa	Social workers again.

RxZqP0cdaa	To be honest with you, Arthur Scargill refuses most attempts to get him to interview.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	I remember the Thatcher regime. She wanted to break the union hold and used underhand tactics to achieve it with the miners union. Arthur Scargill seen it coming at the time. He has been silent ever since.|`|bGuVAltxaa	Im not to sure but I believe a lot of the miners believe Scargill sold them out to Thatcher and broke the miners so he is not that popular but don't quote me on it.|`|RKUrIHI5aa	Scargill refuses to be interviewed.

End of part one (20.43.23). Adverts. (20.46.01) Part two. The subject turns to the Miners' Strike of 1984/85. Muriel Gray alledges strategic errors on his part. He defends himself and the subject turns to pit closures (20.47.31). The question of a national ballot not being called during the year long strike (20.48.04). The divisiveness of the strike. The subject of violence by police and miners. He defends miners against the allegations of violence. The subject turns to the taxi driver who was killed (a media preoccupation) and the absence of discussion about the eleven others who died during the dispute. Arthur Scargill refuses to condemn miners for defending their jobs (20.51.29). He reiterates this point as Muriel Gray expressess her 'disappointment' at his response. He quotes the thirteen thousand arrested, seven thousand injured and the eleven dead (20.52.30). He is asked if the Government ever tried to corrupt him. He says he has been offered the Chairmanship of the National Coal Board and a position in a Conservative Administration (Edward Heath's) in the Energy Department, among others (20.53.38). Wombwell Main Colliery. They climb fences into the pit yard. The pit closed in 1969. While they examine the tiny remains of the pit, Arthur Scargill talks of 'fighting on' (20.55.34).

qKDyFOMDaa	anything is possible bro.|`|i7oHTo9haa	No that's not the connection with economy and war.  What the connection is that when the economy is bad people naturally talk about war because they're not living up the high life on some beach or resort or otherwise distracted. In economic crisis, people aren't distracted they're looking at what's up. <br>  <br>  What makes this particular economic crisis different is that there are alot of wars for us to talk about.  Radical Islam is on the move and it's spearheaded by Iran.<br>  <br>  We're already in War.. Operation Iraqi Freedom is finishing up and we're still in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  We'll have to do more but it won't be because of economic crisis or any of our doing.  It's entirely to do with radical Islam on the move.  Nobody likes Iran except their extremist buddies and the West is allied up with moderates in the Middle East fighting against it already.  Iran is rogue and highly mobile right now.
GOpQsYHUaa	In my youth I marched many times in London screaming "Maggie, Maggie, Maggie,  out out out!" and "Education for the masses not just for the ruling classes".<br>  <br>  In the mid-eighties I was a Militant Tendency sympathiser (lol) and met and marched alongside Derek Hatton and the late, great Terry Fields.<br>  <br>  Here in Spain taking to the streets to protest is a national pastime.<br>  It really is a huge point in their favour here. There are protests for EVERYTHING.  On my way back from town right now ina five minute walk I′ve passed an anti homophobic rally, an anti racist demonstration and a youth against something or other gathering. <br>  <br>  In the Basque country frequent pro and anti terrorist marches are held. Armed and masked police are a frequent sight and nobody bats an eyelid at the anti riot gear.<br>  <br>  <br>  In 1997 with the killing of Miguel Angel Blanco, Spain hit the headlines when literally tens of millions of Spaniards took to the streets all over the country to protest.<br>  <a href="http://turan.uc3m.es/uc3m/inst/MU/publicaciones/Madrid/1997_asst_maniMBlanc_pcol_f.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://turan.uc3m.es/uc3m/inst/MU/public...</a>|`|eUuFPJAFaa	No, I have never protested about anything yet.

The Student Union rep for our Uni told us to march with our placards (bearing the almighty mantra "Say NO to fees") but under NO circumstances do a sitting protest in the road.<br>  <br>  Many other Unis were there (was in Trafalgar Square, London), and they went hell for leather. People were dragged away, and in hindsight I wish I had got more involved.<br>  <br>  A second protest took place the following year, but although I promised to attend, I had resigned myself to the fact it was pointless.<br>  <br>  I was really hoping to see protests when the fuel bills went up shockingly last year, but alas there were none.

6Q106szjaa	well, cameras have been allowed inside the trailer. the back bedroom where haleigh, her brother and dad's gf were sleeping has a master bath in it. the gf said when she woke up that night to use the bathroom, she noticed the kitchen light was on. according to nancy grace, the layout of the home indicates she would had to have left the bedroom and use the bathroom on the other end of the house to notice the kitchen light was on...imo if they were in the dark it seems as though she would have been able to see the light from the room w/out leaving it esp if the bedroom door was open but who knows...what's esp creepy to me is that when she went to the kitchen, both back doors were propped wide open...the outside screen door was propped open with some concrete blocks and the inside door was held open by some dirty laundry that had already been on the floor. they demonstrated that both doors swing shut (the outside screen door slams completely shut and the inside door closes to a crack)...to me this indicates the abductor KNEW the doors would make noise so has to be someone that is in the family circle or someone that may have been stalking haleigh? i personally don't find it suspicious that the gf could have slept through the abduction because a lot of us are heavy sleepers; she could have easily slept through an intruder quietly entering the home. reports indicate the floor does not make much noise while walking through the house...on the other hand, maybe she wasn't even there and left the kids home alone as previously suspected...i do wonder why there was no sign of forced entry (the lock and dead bolt on back door were not damaged)...maybe someone picked the lock? that's pretty much all we know right now...everyone's a suspect if you ask me...i can't think of a motive for gf to be involved but you never know. a deranged pedophile may be willing to do about anything to a child...and also there is new speculation this could have been revenge for her dad "snitching" in a drug case...whooo...what a story. the more i hear about it the more interesting it gets...i hope she's ok!|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	the mobile home that she vanished from is no longer a designated crime scene, but the family still wont go in there cuz of seeing haliegh's room & her things --too traumatic. this week cadaver dogs hit on a local dumpster cuz human remains smell was in there, but no sign of haleigh. they r further questioning the crossly girl who last saw her. cuz she may have snuck out to party/be w/friends after the kids went 2 sleep &thats when perp may have gotten in 2 steal haleigh. may have been watching the house & saw the 17 yr old girl leave.|`|7L8Q91KBaa	Was the girlfriend given a drug test?

This concept should go.

We do not care for basic discipline.<br>  5) Many people are interested in watching T.V.s and their own entertainments. They do not  give proper care on their adolecent children's activity. <br>  6) Students activity in Politics should be banned.<br>  7) After completion of education, every body should be made to spend their service in social activitiesfor atleast two year. It will make them to think beyond their own desires.<br>  8) A Terrorist who was caught by the police can be made to live with a family who lost their member due to terrorist killing.<br>  9) Terrorist net work should be cut.

So who is that? most of the country , like USA, Russia, Korea, France etc which export weapon are the countries which are fighting terrorist who r using these weapons. hehehehe what a contradiction.<br>  Second everybody should understand that all religion is made for living a happy life. There is no excuse in fighting in the name of  religion.<br>  Third respect the feeling of others<br>  The last point, to all those who are saying bad of the political situation and the politics. Don't just sit there and say politics is bad and who all are involved in politics is bad, react, join a political party and air you voice. Say what you want to say. don't just watch TV and say the politics sucks............, go get into it and change it other wise shut up and work for you and your family never comment on what is happening to the country or the world, cause you don't have the right to.

The Bush reigme, zionism, aswell as those- misguided individuals who commit terror such as 911,- mumbai attack, etc. are a universal enemy of- humanity.<br>  I appreciate that in retaliation there are- individuals, becoming radicalized in retaliation to the- attacks such as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine etc.- But i feel we must unite regardless of our beliefs to- fight off terrorism and really understand the reality- of the attacks. For example noone can argue about Bush's- invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan and attack against- civilians in other countries such as the NW Pakistan in- recent times aswell as can one question the civilian- attack of the mumbai attack. Some deluded people may- try to justify such an attack but in reality wrong is- wrong no matter who it is done by. <br>  We must also look- to the vericty of those accused for example the mumbai- attack is full of controversy; India concluded the- perputrators as an unknown organisation, in some- unknown location in Pakistan, and the terrorst being- supported by Pakistan intelligence. But no evidence as- UN claims has been proposed, apart frokm an email sent- by the unknown organisation taking responsibility, and- America's inevitable backing. So I feel we must- look behind lie's portrayed by biased media.<br>  To sum up we should stop jumping into conclusion everytime CNN and FOX portray their side of the story, which will represent the views of those funding them, and condemn and protest against our govenment to change its foriegn policies and unite to condemn terrorist attacks no matter who the perputrators are, whether our own or not.|`|o3yhqPzhaa	The USA and other countries must unite and stomp it out.

AA11163314	For one thing a draft would cause greater numbers of 'the poor' to serve in the military.<br>  <br>  Contrary to the liberal myth - the military is made up mostly of the middle and upper classes.  The poor are significantly under-represented in the current US military. (Mostly due to the military's standards for education and a lack of a criminal record.)<br>  <br>  The idea of allowing open homosexuals to serve will drive away the long service veterans and many of the 'high quality' recruits.  The fact of the matter is that the demographics of people who support homosexuals in the military are primiarily made up of people who would never consider serving themselves.  OTOH the military's recruiting base is composed of people who would feel uncomfortable if they were required to share a shower with a homosexual.<br>  <br>  How would you like it if _you_ had to share a shower with one or more open homosexuals?|`|GOifC7i3aa	anyone can serve in the military ...not just the poor<br>  <br>  and do you mean homosexuals?<br>  <br>  and is there a need to bring back the draft if sufficient numbers are enlisting?|`|AYyTlTSkaa	hate to break this to you but hetrosexuals have always served in the military since like George Washington was in office so that won't be an issue at all....<br>  <br>  The draft is a bad idea.

It is a Democrat thing,  not an Obama thing.    <br>  <br>  And it is a universal draft,  everyone has to serve in some manner.  If it passes then the gays will have to serve.   And I see Obama doing away with the "get out of service because of gay card" for them.  I bet they will hate it.
Ong8SIijaa	Its a fact that collapse of USSR,communist eastern europe,berlin wall etc. were all staged acts to fool west into disarmament.And disarmement and giving in to the communist tactics has been the policy of bush administration and i don't think obama administration would be any different,only even more so.When WW3 start and communists have conquered much of the world,you will know this is true.|`|TotgRmRZaa	communism failed because,marx was a historian,and not an econimist.lenin wanted to sell the ideology so bad,that he took up with crazy,and sadistic people like stalin.i like the idea of the people.the oppression that came with it was it's downfall.a command economy would never work.the nomenclature,are the biggest capitalists ever.when you take god out of the equation.you set yourself up for failure.|`|7rCASaZIaa	WayLeft...Did you graduate from UC Berkley or Columbia?

Labour were the ones who removed the centralised power to regulate the banks from the Bank of England. Labour were the ones who could have addressed the runaway practises, including short-selling, of the corporate banking world LONG before all the sleaze of the sector was brought to light; after recent collapses and banks on their knees to the government for bailouts.<br>  <br>  Thatcher's ethos was the guiding light for today's greed - but if you think bankers were lovely and conservative and honest before then, you are very, very much mistaken.<br>  <br>  Labour had the opportunity, but failed, to "fix the roof while the sun was shining" in the glory vintage years of 2003 - 2006.<br>  <br>  EDIT:- Can you get past the first sentence, CLAIRE?|`|1b0c3e2d3a247486be3edf6505567294aa	stop the share holders taking the profits our money makes,!!|`|RxZqP0cdaa	I am at a total loss to understand where this country wwantsto go.<br>  Thatcher obliterated manufacturing in this country.

xU7AaQOdaa	"We Didn't Start the Fire" is a song by Billy Joel that makes reference to a catalog of headline events during his lifetime, from March 1949 to 1989, when the song was released on his album Storm Front. The events are mixed with a refrain asserting "we didn't start the fire". The song was a number-one hit in the U.S.<br>  <br>  The song and music video have been interpreted as a rebuttal to criticism of Joel's Baby Boomer generation, from both its preceding and succeeding generations. The song's title and refrain imply that the frenzied and troubled state which others were criticizing had been the state of the world since long before his generation's time, but that this was being ignored by their critics."|`|4GBJBsLDaa	In reference to the Korean war in the 1950's between North and South Korea.
cPuicv06aa	Sadly, I do believe there will be more family violence as our unemployment rates rise, and more people lose their homes.|`|GOifC7i3aa	america is not the only place where this happens<br>  <br>  similar incidents happen all over the world<br>  <br>  so yes there will be more in america and elsewhere too<br>  <br>  and where there are no guns people kill their kids in other ways....|`|dKTPewhTaa	Unfortunately, you might see more of this happening.  America has lost its morals and not many are Christians.  I'm not talking about the type of Christians that say they are Christian and then turn around and bash gay people and the like. The world is full of those type of "Christians"  My son wanted to know about the 10 Commandments and all I told him was if he lived by those rules that there wouldn't be any killing, there wouldn't be any greed or jealousy and the like. There wouldn't be any broken families and people would love and help one another.  But back to your question, yes, there will more than likely be more tragedy like that.  There is more to life than material things and how one person sees themselves as an extension of what they own or have or do not have.  <br>  Instead of the banks helping the family keep their home, they want to foreclose.  It is Greed and not helping one another.   Greed has gotten America in the shape it is in today -- depression. <br>  Just think how the poor people kept the wallstreet people in the bailout from losing their homes with big swimming pools and what not?  We still earn close to minimum wage while the brokers and what not are still earning more money in a year than some people will see in a lifetime.  It's just not right, but that is life in America.|`|sR4HjV9Paa	I believe this dude had some kind of demonic influence on him.

Things are going to get really bad. When governments go broke, then there will be utter chaos. People have been acting like animals for a long time now.

AA11049477	So many theories so many points of view & I try not to be influenced by them, I try & make up my own mind.<br>  Thing is, we have been bombarded with loads of differing information or faced with media black-outs that halted anything that each opposing side deemed negative press.<br>  I found a link the other day, see below, surprised it's not been removed which made me realise we MAY never know what happened to poor maddie ( I'm making a stand for ordinary people who refer to this poor neglected child by a name the media gave her & before g mccann started shouting the odds " we call her Madeline " ) <br>  <br>  I remember his excuses at the press conference <br>  "same as eating at the bottom of the garden, <br>  they didn't want to leave their children with strangers <br>  or everybody else does it " <br>  leaves their children alone so parents have some me-time.<br>  <br>  I think she died in that apartment & now camp mccann have money, we have no hope of getting justice for maddie.|`|cPuicv06aa	I do not believe Maddie's parents killed her.  I believe they both were totally irresponsible in leaving children alone.  I think someone kidnapped this precious little girl.|`|1OiYhNoIaa	I agree with NutstersChick. The parents weren't cooperating with the official investigation from the start, opting to employ the services of the British media and a team of lawyers to push their side of the story. This meant that the local police were severely hampered, even to the extent of wasting precious time interrogating an innocent man "fingered" by a journalist who had nothing to do with the disappearance of Maddy. Unfortunately, without conclusive forensic evidence, it's impossible to prove what actually happened and the chances are that, without a confession, the crime will remain a mystery.|`|4ITFF8pEaa	Unfortunate typo there, haha. I'm guessing you mean 'her' parents?<br>   <br>  The person who supposedly kidnapped Madeleine obviously wanted to remain under the radar, so of course he/she would not have wanted to stir the other children. A rich little kid with a cute face would be quite inviting to kidnappers, and some people can get a little obsessive that leads them to do out of the ordinary actions, such as actually stealing children from their parents.<br>  There's a whole lot of propaganda around this case, and I think we should all stop making up false accusations and assumptions. There is no solid evidence to prove anyone's point.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	Theres a lot of possibilities and conspiracy theories. A reason that one child could be taken and the other 2 left could be because someone kidnapped her to order. This is when someone pays for a person of a certain description to be found and taken for them. So they could have wanted a girl of Madeleine's age,hair colour,eye colour etc.
AA10529938	Providing information to the masses.  The biggest obstacle to an effective democracy is lack of information.  Constituents need to be able to make informed decisions to be able to support a democracy.  TV and radio replaced newspapers as the primary means for a candidate to get a message out to voters.<br>  <br>  That's one reason Obama made it into office, because the Internet has now supplanted TV and radio as a primary means to get a message out, and he's mastered the Net.

I personally am making more $ now. Is that because of Obama, i dont know. But if he doesnt bail out the banks and big corps, where will your large purchases come from? There wont be any loans, so this will come out of your personal savings. How many homes and cars and repairs and remodels can you do with $200, 000? Give or take. <br>  <br>  I know the companies screwed themselves over, but so did the house flipping greedy homeowners. No pity there, but they DO keep the market going.  Obama has so far overturned tons of Bush Admin policies that brought this economy to what it is. That cant be all that bad.|`|cIttXzrwaa	No, that was the George Bush policies that already did that.|`|cjlwOKR1aa	no it will not, his policies are good to bring usa out of the economic crisis, not vice versa|`|crDjAk0Laa	NO

It is the surrounding, parenting and the people with whom interacts right from childhood. working parents, affluent neighbor, plenty of leisure hours, are certain factors that germinate tentacles of extremism and aggression in the young heart and minds. If we all could do anything to stay by our young ones a bit more and pay due attention to their tender feelings and emotions, the atmosphere of terrorism may decline.
