aDeDOmxBaa	Im not sure about the genetics exactly either but here is an educated guess.    Some animal species have random litters, some have identical colouring to their own as there is no colour variations. With mice im not sure but i think that the commonly sold mouse is most likely a mix breed.    You will find that a mouse with the same colouring as yours is more likely to produce offspring with that colour variation, but it is not guaranteed. If you go to a pet shop that breed their own, or know the breeder you may be able to find out what the parents were. It wouldn't hurt to ask.    Other than this you may find its hit and miss. Have a look out for a chinchilla mouse coat variety they are grey with red eyes also!    Gem x|`|lhmsAlQuaa	Hamsters Yes Mouse no i know a little bit about hamsters colors but not mouse sorry|`|Cj5t4vfDaa	If you want pups the same colour as the male. then mate him with a female the same colour as the male. that way you have a 100% chance. only if the female doesn't have a different genetic background|`|Rem7xsCUaa	a silver one lol|`|yQIOXv5Yaa	either with another silver or, if you know what color his parents were, a mouse that looks like one of the parents.     the other possibility is that silvers rarely produce silvers. i know with horses that true blacks usually dont have black babies. its more common for a bay or a grey to produce a black horse. silver may be the same way- i don't personally know about that specific color for mice. it could just as easily be the other way around though.    good luck!    p.s. you might also want to try searching the internet for a mouse breeder and email them ans ask.|`|AA11809403	WOW - they think there are up to 125 genes involved in mouse colors.  that makes it tricky to know what is dominant and what is recessive.    It looks like a recessive gene, as best I can tell ( i'm guessing, i was reading fast.)    but from what i was reading, you will have the best odds if you get another silver mouse.   even then, you might not get silver mouse babies.   They seem rare, at best.    but remember, i was reading fast and know nothing about breeding mice.
CdRlOsnyaa	No often times an algea eater will suck on the frogs skin or on its eyes and if you get a small algea eater the frogs will tend to eat it.
qeOlkRM0aa	That really depends. Some breeders don't show their best rabbits at fairs, because they usually have to leave the rabbits at the fair for the whole time the fair is open (a week or so). Therefor, they may not be too expensive.   Don' t buy from Petco. The ones by me don't even have rabbits. I don't recommend buying from a pet store, unless you KNOW they take good care of their animals. There is good store by me, but they are very rare.  Look in the paper, or find a breeder near you and see what they have.|`|t6UkxbBNaa	State Fairs usually auction off rabbits. Try looking up rabbit breeders or rescues they will usually sell you a pet quality rabbit for an a amazing price (usually 10 or 15 dollars).  PS: PetCo is usually expensive and plus you would be supporting local 'rabbit mills' which do inner-breeding (brothers and sisters together *EW!* etc.) and usually don't take good care of rabbits.
rCgYepfXaa	Hello,       I have a toy poodle and is scared of everything and everybody. But he was adopted and we think he was abused by his previous owners. In your case, however first of all it is not good to yell at your dog or like others have said, sticking your dogs face in its mess and spank it. Dogs have very a bad memory and so yelling at it after it has already gone will make your dog angry with you because he does not know what you are yelling about. With that said some people think the sticking your dogs face in the mess will bring back his memory, but it will not. Even though your not yelling at him ridiculously you should not yell at all instead say "No, go potty outside" very gently then take her outside. What you should do now is start all over with her. Like you just met for the first time. Snuggle with her when you can, take her out for walks if she likes them, and play some games with her indoors. When you guys walk up to her and she gets scared, get down to her level slowly and pet her very gently. Now, if this doesn't work or you fell you have already tried this then you should first talk to your vet, tell her what has been happening and perhaps ask her if there any dog behaviorists she recommends. Keep in mind though, that this could possibly be something wrong with her mentally.|`|AA11305153	It is going to take some time.  The good news though, is that dogs are very forgiving animals and just want to love you.    Start out slow.  Have lots of treats with you and whenever your dog approaches you, give her a treat with lots of praise.  She will start to associate you with the treat.  I can almost guarantee this will work.  Don't force the little pup into doing anything she doesn't want to.  Some dogs come around a lot faster than others do.  It all depends on how food motivated she is.      Give this a try.  Hopefully it works out for you.    Good luck!|`|37kEGTzjaa	simple just use a lower voice when you yell at her make it the angry tone and use when shes in trouble. when she is scared lower tone and comfort her. But become a little more independent or she might be a big baby when she is older. and make sure other people do it so if you go away she is used to different people. have a regular tone when shes not good or bad.|`|gdvCvWrLaa	don't yell or screem at a dog.  when it's going to the bathroom in the house stick it's nose in it and give it a good pop. this may sound mean but it works.  when constantly yelling at a dog it doesn't know what it's doing wrong.  that is why you must put it's nose in it because then it knows what it shouldn't do and it will stop because nobody likes having there nose stuck in their buisness.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	well DONT yell or stomp at her    never yell at a dog unless its desperatley needed  posotive reinforcment works better|`|pvgwJwxvaa	stop yelling at your dog and talk to your vet or a qualified animal behaviorist.|`|Mnkuxy8yaa	talk to your vet about it.      If it continues she'll end up like mine (who's a rescue) and on 2 types of medication....|`|csvGd6DHaa	stop yelling at your dog.then she won't be scared of things
3sB49YNnaa	Your sow should be getting all the 18% protein guinea pig chow with stabilized vitamin C she will eat, good quality grass hay, plenty of fresh water and a moderate amount of greens both now and after the pups are born.    Ignore the advice from the person who says you cannot touch the pups.  It is simply not correct..  You can handle the pups.  If the boar is in with the sow, take him out now, not because he will harm the babies (he won't) but because he will re-breed the sow within hours after delivery which is not good    Any bedding suitable for the sow is suitable for the sow and litter.    Wean by a combination of age and weight.  You want the pups at least 6 ounces (170g) before weaning.  For us, that is usually by 10 days which is the absolute earliest you can wean them.  We prefer that they be 8 ounces and 2 weeks.  In any case, you want them weaned and the boar pups separated from the sow pups by 3 weeks.|`|lhmsAlQuaa	Here's some Info!    1. NEVER EVER TOUCH THE BABY'S cause this could confuse the scent of the baby's and the mother might not recognize its hers and she might abandon it or worse EAT it  2.Keep daddy away Daddy will eat them even if you didn't touch the baby's  3. Avoid cleaning the cage   4. wait till 2 weeks have pass sense they were born to pick them up But i recommend  you wait till they are at least 6 weeks old to be safe  5. Make Sure the Hamster has the right type of bedding cause with the wrong bedding it could suffocate the baby's or end up with Asthma problems|`|U55NCXmUaa	we had a guinea pig a long time ago.  i don't remember too much about the caring for the mother, but please be careful with her cage.  our guinea pig gave birth during the day and by the time we came home, we noticed that one of the pups had died.  his head got stuck between the cage bars and he couldn't get out on his own.  if you could find a way to line it somehow...|`|HjVjSI6uaa	use the regular bedding thats already in the cage, but make sure its clean and there is a lot of it for her to nest. also, keep the male in a seperate cage. aside from that, they are guinea pigs let them do their thing.
HSLMHpyEaa	Sounds like a nice whimsical idea, but it is not true!  Dogs can sense changes in mood, so maybe that is what she is picking up on.  They would have no clue if you had a bun in the oven!|`|AA11992723	i hope you plan to spay her when the vet says it is ok (or when the breeder says since some vets do tend to spay/neuter too early)    i think obedience classes are needed too esp if you have a baby coming but even if not, your puppy will be a big dog in no time and might be a big risk to you, someone else and her own life at stake.    if youre worried about her health, check the color of the gums, they shouldn't be too pale or too dark.|`|DN6XtoViaa	Good Luck!  i hope you get your BFP!  keep me updated!    i heard the same thing about dogs and cats... i don't know how true it is though, but you never know :)|`|wuBIF9aPaa	she is just maturing.  it has nothing to do with your pregnancy|`|C1eHfhrHaa	OK- why are you allowing the dog to growl at you all the time?  If you are pregnant, that is a bad environment to bring a baby in to and one that you need to correct before the baby arrives.|`|velIdcbNaa	I don't know really.  She could.  Dogs are known to Sense seizures, and heart attacks.  She may know.|`|ba86e3c1dafe29cda3bf9356d0bbeec1aa	Unless you have bacon in your pocket...the change in her demeanor seems a bit quirky.    if you're more mellow than normal, maybe she is just sensing your vibe and responding in kind.|`|0a07f2e5a084ebc8ae39f790612c5390aa	I seriously doubt it but a Rottweiler is a very powerful breed and she needs obedience classes now.. You never let her growl at you and her not discipline her you will regret it in the future!!!!! Get her some training now!!!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	It could just be her personality changing - but it might not be! Do post on here when you find out - I bet you are pregnant!!    Please may I offer some advice regarding this pup tho as I work in dog behaviour and puppy training and socialisation. No 5 month old puppy should ever be growling, and certainly should not get to 'be mean when she wants to be'. For a breed like a rottie, I'd say you've got some potential trouble on your hands. This unfortunately is how it can start. It does not sound like she knows her place in the 'pack' - as you said, she doesn't listen to you and she MUST. If there is a new baby and she doesn't see it is above her in the pack you could really have problem on your hands.    You said yourself "She never ever listens to me and is always growling at me " This is NOT acceptable for any 5 month old pup, but it is especially dangerous with breeds who are natural guarders and naturally dominant. PLEASE take some action now - get the dog and yourself enrolled in training classes and get someone to show you how to get her to obey you ALWAYS.     The methods you've mentioned - time out and withholding of treats unfortunately are not useful training methods. 'Time outs' do not exist in the dog world, and withholding of treats is meaningless to her. For the sake of your family and the dog, please do find a reputable training class so you can learn some useful methods. Apart from anything else, dogs are happier when they know their place in their pack.    Chalice
a29qiNkvaa	YOu know this pisses my off too! I also have 2 Akita's and neither one would harm  anyone! and for everyone that says they are know to be aggressive PLEASE! ALL DOGS CAN BE AGGRESSIVE!       it the owner that makes the dog aggressive! Not the breed!!!!!|`|ofUe4hBkaa	its the same with my dobies rottie and bullmastiff.  Im always reading on here people saying that rottweilers are aggressive and are not family pets just because they have a guarding instinct.  i totally agree with you when you say " if one child attacks does this mean all children are dangerous"  this is 100% true|`|9kTejB0uaa	Too many people who think they know it all.  And media hype.  Blame the DEED not the BREED eh.|`|velIdcbNaa	Because the breed is known for aggressiveness, but i know Akitas that are like babies, and I know ones that are not safe for people.  It all depends on how knowledgeable people are with dogs.|`|c8uI3n0Raa	Close-mindedness.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	what?|`|3IApfZopaa	Because this is YA, you ask they answer.  Nobody said they have to be right .. lol|`|f419df7a7a06e14dfdf6ab874c949c5baa	people those people are ridiculous, and like to generalise.    just like children growing into adults, pets are what you raise them to be.  so even the smallest dog can be a crazy canine, and the butchest Pitball be a fairy.    it is a shame that so many animals are being victimised by the bad raising of a few.    All outlawing of dogs must stop!|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Well, to be honest, it is NOT strictly based upon how you raise them.    You can take two separate dogs, one from a properly bred litter, and another from a litter bred willy-nilly, raise them the same, and they will have two separate chances of being biting crazy animals.    The same applies to ALL breeds of dogs.     If a dog is bred improperly (meaning the parents aren't temperamentally and behaviorally evaluated prior to breeding, they don't have thyroid and blood panels done, etc) how you raise it doesn't mean anything.    Teaching a dog RIGHT (not "rite") from wrong doesn't weigh anything compared to having a dog that is mentally and physically sound. A well bred Akita (or any breed of dog) that is properly trained and socialized as a puppy and young adult will do just fine.    An improperly bred Akita who's parents have aggressive tendencies (or an aggressive background) can be socialized up and down the walls and trained until its owners face turns blue and STILL run the risk of attacking someone or something.    All dogs deserve an individual chance, no one should lable an entire breed based on a minuscule number of attacks that may or may not have been part of the breed.|`|wXUkHiqHaa	It is because many people do not get that any animal with teeth can bite. My animal care teachers once said that a lot of breeds get a bad reputation just because a few biters. What many don't get is that any breed can bite and often it is something that surprises them and sets off the fight or flight instinct. That many owners don't see the early warning signs that can start as young as puppy-hood.    If they can see the early signs then they can nip it in the butt before it goes to full blown aggression.    Also the dog whisper will say the same thing. Catch it at level one before it reaches level ten (A.K.A. The red zone cases).|`|0a07f2e5a084ebc8ae39f790612c5390aa	Well for one they are known as an aggressive breed I am the last to characterize any breed I own a Pit Bull but you also have to know aggressive breeds can snap at anytime for any reason it doesn't have to do with the way you raise them its just who they are of course it helps that they are raised right but as an owner you need to remember you have a responsibility to your dog and the community to take certain measures to try an prevent any one from getting hurt by your dogs.. I guess us owners of aggressive breeds need to be on alert at all times I know every time I take my dog out for a walk or in public I am you have to be its your responsibility and if you don't own an aggressive breed or never have you don't really need to comment because you don't and cant understand..|`|n3ejROqbaa	im kinda in the same boat as you. i have a german shepherd and i couldnt rent a house because theyre on the aggressive dog list....so i ended up buying a house. akitas are awesome dogs though. i have a friend of mine that has two of them and they are amazing dogs. i love wrestling with them because my german shepherd wont really wrestle with me too much but when i wrestle around with the akitas its so much fun. as soon as they get a lil rough and start hurting me they know to ease up. awesome dogs....i wouldnt and i cant say anything negative about them.|`|PM23RDycaa	The same reason people comment about APBTs, american bullys, Staffies etc etc.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Because they think that just becasue they were originally bred to fight, and sometimes have a bad rep. they think they are awful dogs.    AND THERE WRONG.    Every dog is born pure, it's the humans who mess them up. They think that Akitas are bad, when truley they are warm loving dogs.     So don't believe the media when they say, A DOG HURT SOMEONE...I mean, it may have happend. But the source of the problem is either the owner messing the dog up, a bad thing that happend to the dog that freaked it out, or possible mental health conditions.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	its ignorance    all you can do is educate and make sure your dogs are great ambassadors for the breed
wowU3iMsaa	well when their a baby and juvi feed them every day as much as they want. babys will do fine in a 29 gallon tank at first but when full grown the minimum is a 4'x4'x2' cage. id say build your own big cage cuz its way cheeper. their tanks should have plants real or fake in them. if the plants are real make sure there harmless to the water dragon by checking it on a website off of google or yahoo. once there full grown feed them every other day. o, and feed them mostly crickets, and some mealworms.not too many mealworms cuz they tend to get more addicted to eating that and stop eating the crickets unless if there starved. you need to get a 5% uvb bulb at your petshop. these help transmit uvb rays to your reptile.(uvb is sun rays.) if you need any more info just search chinese water dragon care sheet and you'll find a good amount of info. once they become a big enough you can feed them feeder fish too.|`|i7o1zE8Saa	They are capable of eating insects, small fish such as goldfish, small mammals such as "pinky" mice, and certain vegetation.

B6zl0AJDaa	Make sure your paste wormer covers bots.    You can also use pumice stone to removed them OR an old bic razor works too.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Soak his legs in very warm water (not hot). This causes the larvae to leave the eggs within minutes.  They emerge because of the warmth, as they would in the stomach.  Then wash the larvae away.  You won't get all of them, but you'll get most.  There are different types that lay eggs in other areas like the lips, so you still have to deworm for them.  Then be sure to deworm again before spring.  The eggs you don't get and that the horse ingests will attach to the walls of the stomach.  You want to get the larvae after all of the eggs are ingested,  while they are in the stomach, and kill them off before the warm weather comes again in spring and before they are passed to become botflies and repeat the cycle.  Ivermectin is effective against bots.|`|px27V5N9aa	Don't worry about them being on there.  Just scrape them off and continue on with your deworming program.  If you are really freaking out, have a fecal count done.    When you deworm for bots, check the manure the next day for 'red pills'.  Those are the bots.    Make sure you scrape them off in an area the horses do not frequent.  Like a side yard.  You don't want them to accidentally ingesting them.|`|RloOJ43haa	You can get them off by scrubbing with a pumice stone.|`|HS44HUrgaa	get em off|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Yeah, you can scrape them off. Are you sure your dewormer covers botflies? If it does, you have nothing to worry about, even if he has the eggs on him.|`|YQgSrJI6aa	Don't worry ! There just fly eggs ! You can get them off with a bot knife at tack shops , its really easy .. the horse I lease gets them all the time :) .|`|L2rivPUWaa	You should be able to pick up a bot fly scraper from you local saddlery to scrap theses eggs off.      http://www.horserides.org|`|y7H1V39Jaa	You can either take a fecal sample to your vet or make sure that your next worming regimen includes them.|`|WVyP2I4saa	Remove them with a "bot scraper", razor, knife or scissors using the flat edge.

wdsGPJFiaa	Honestly, it depends on the rodent itself. they're kinda like people, either they will get along or they wont.    try getting them both and putting them in the same tank at first. if they start to fight....  then you can try getting a clear tank divider and put it in the middle so each has its own side. if they still hiss, scratch or make a fuss with eachother you may want to invest in another tank. but for a while a clear tank divider will be ok.    as for kepping them a secret.put them in your closet? lol   i dunno how nosey your mom is... but sneek stuff in your room slowly. like don't buy everything in one day and bring it all home that same day.    good luck :)|`|lynmeenmaa	no iv 3 hamsters they have taken over my life and even my next door neighbours know about them so u will never keep them secret dont be stupid and they will probably fight.|`|t6UkxbBNaa	wow that's parent/child-suicide!

You can't hide them in a closet.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Hmmm, should I address the lying or pet keeping issue first?    The only reason to keep a pet a secret from your parents is if you know you're not allowed to have them. Basically, you are lying to your parents by doing something that you know they don't approve of.     It's also really unsafe to hide an animal from your parents. What would happen if you got sick and couldn't take care of it? They wouldn't even know it existed to lend a hand.     Keeping different species of rodents together is dangerous. It's a recipe for a dead pet or two. Always keep each type in its own cage.|`|PGkbPBZmaa	You cannot hide a hamster or a mouse. They both smell, make a mess, and make noises. You can't keep them in a dark closet either.  Also, you CANNOT keep them together, they will kill each other right away. You won't even have them in the same cage for a couple of hours before one is dead.     And whoever said they are going to try it with a rat, that is terrible. Why would you do that to a rat or whatever other species it is going to live with? Even rats and mice - not the same and will KILL each other.     You should talk to your mom. What happens when she finds out? I can promise you that she will.  She might make you let them go, or get rid of them, and then not trust you again.  Really, just talk to her about it first. Prove you are responsible.

It astounds me that you'd consider getting rid of your faithful dog of eleven years just because she's been having accidents. Older dogs have weaker bladders. If she's healthy, just take her on more walks.    Give her treats when she goes outside, and don't rub her nose in it. That's disgusting and ineffective.|`|bQ9LJcEoaa	Have you ever watched Animal planet.  Well they have a show named "It's me or the dog" but anyways they have some helpful tips on training your dog.   Go to it|`|q1qvs1oyaa	When you were a baby it sounds like your mother used to put your nose in your pee.Mans BEST FRIEND is a DOG treat the dog as your best friend,like everyone has said the poor dog is TELLING YOU that its sick.Your mum should remember that you only do that when its a puppy not 11 years old,my dog is  20 yrs old and I dont comdemn him if he pisses on the floor by acident,you should take her out an hour earlier than normally.Or leave her in the back yard until it gets dark.
3sB49YNnaa	It is highly unlikely that you can infect your pig or that your pig can infect you! Colds are always viruses which are highly species specific. There are a few bacterial strains which will cross infect pigs and people. The only commonly cross infecting disease is the skin fungus ringworm.    The best protection to use against spread of infections is what they do in hospitals. Practice good hygiene. That means lots of hand washing and common sense like don't cough on your pig or let him cough on you.|`|lhmsAlQuaa	I dont know i Thought i knew everything thier is to know about hamsters and this stuff but with guinea pig's? i think so i would be safe and keep him away? this is a very interesting question?|`|aDeDOmxBaa	I studied animal welfare and care for the best part of three years. That was a while ago but i do know that there is a possibility of cross infection however you can also catch something from him!    I would say unless you are (or he is) very unhealthy then you should be ok. If you have a cold as hard as it is keep away if you are snotty, coughing and sneezing and handle him less. Always wash your hands and keep the window open a little at night (unless a security risk) to allow fresh air in. If you are really worried maybe place him somewhere else temporarily.    Hope you feel better soon!     Gem x|`|uvU5DnHcaa	They can catch colds from us yes but to catch a cold from you really depends on how long you have had it or if its viral or bacterial  So if in early stages just don't handle him. This should help you decide if to move him or not.    The common cold is a viral infection of the lining of the nose, sinuses, throat. A cold is most contagious during the first 1 or 2 days after symptoms develop. Colds spread mainly when people's hands come in contact with nasal secretions from an infected person. These secretions contain cold viruses. When people then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes, the viruses gain entry to the body and cause a cold. Less often, colds are spread when people breathe air containing droplets that were coughed or sneezed out by an infected person.     When a common cold has lasted for 7-10 days and is no better or worse, acute bacterial sinusitis may have developed and additional medical care may be required. Antibiotics will be needed to treat bacterial colds as they are a secondary condition from the first.|`|va8xvhthaa	If you sneeze, the germs kinda explode out of your nose, so you probably should remove your guinea pig from your room if you don't want him to get sick. The germs could spread and eventually get to him. But get better soon!|`|jsb1M81Laa	I don't think you have to. Just don't kiss it or anything, it could catch the cold that way for sure. But i'm not saying it WILL, there's just a higher chance. I have a bad cough and cold, and my rabbit is doing fine|`|cx6kAJ73aa	Don't worry, Guinea Pigs cannot get sicknesses from humans, your piggies will be fine!    Get better =]|`|JLrs8bxdaa	I've never really thought of that, you should be fine, but don't give him out of cage time or hold him for a bit.  If you're worried enough you should though!    Nice to see people caring!|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	You dont need to remove it from your room. BUT    Hope that helps!    :)  get well soon
0VqULDTWaa	my geldings birthday is 31st march and my mare is on 22nd may, i havent had my mare long so i havent been able to be with her during her birthday but my gelding ive had since he was 4 months old (hes now nearly 9 yrs) and i have always celebrated his birthday!    Its naughty i know but i always buy him and his 2 field mates an iced bun each, my friend (whose 2 ponies share the field with mine) does the same on her horses birthdays. Now this year we will need to buy 4 iced buns as we have my mare in the field aswell!!!    I think its important to celebrate your horse/pony's birthday, i dont care if people say the horse doesnt understand or doesnt know its their birthday i just think how would you like it if someone forgot your birthday??    my horses are treated brilliantly every day but that extra special cake on their birthday makes that day even more special.|`|zU1hrRIgaa	YEAH! June 21st and April 3rd. I dunno when my Arab was born, so sadly she actually is a January 1st...|`|D46Sj0FEaa	am i invited?|`|7lsU5bcoaa	I don't know my horse's birthday, so she ages on the day I got her. I don't make too big of a deal, she gets treats every day and she doesn't know its her fake birthday. She does get Christmas presents though.|`|HS44HUrgaa	ii would if ii had horses (:|`|yDgYSHvaaa	I don't actually know my horse's birthday, so I made one up. I was going to bring him a carrot (his favorite. He normally only gets little dry peppermint cubes) but I forgot. So obviously it's not a huge deal, just something fun. My grandma's soon-to-be-yearling, however.. I am so throwing her a party. I adore that filly.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	lol! That's so cute. We had horses and donkeys and we did celebrate the baby donkey's birthday because we knew the day it was born. He got a carrot cake, a bag of grain (not all at once of course) and a new brush. It was so cute. He knew that it was "his day" too. We celebrate all our animals birthdays. 3 cats, 3 turtles, 12 fish, 1 dog, 4 birds and a mouse. We do have horses and donkeys, but we don't get to see them much because we moved and the person who owns the ranch kind of owns the horses.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I would but I don't know my horse's birthday, he is not registered either, we bought him off a friend. But he gets treats everyday and taken care of to his heart's content.|`|L2rivPUWaa	My parents wedding anniversary is on the horse's birthday, very easy to remember to give the horses treats !        http://www.horserides.org|`|Y6BFsic4aa	For my horses b-day I usually let her have a big horsey party! I get all of the horses who get along well and let them hang out in the same pen the whole day!|`|rLXNwqbFaa	sure why not|`|Xobbmd7Saa	I do! I don't do that whole jan 1st thing either. I do the real bday.     They get a nice curry down while they can munch on hay in the paddock. So they are nice and happy. Some yummy treats and sometimes a new saddle pad or something like that.    I once went to a party at my old barn for a horses 40th! Old horse who was in retirement but totally deserved a party.|`|y7H1V39Jaa	NO, why should I?  They haven't a clue as to when or what their birthday is, I take the best care of them every day, how can I do more than that on their birthday.......and treats?  The treats that I give are an extra time with the brush, talking with them while feeding, having a real connection.  Horses are not people, why must people try to make them so?|`|lI7ceTFDaa	haha yeah, i celebrate my horse's birthday  february 21...he's gonna be 8!!!  my baby's growing up :*( haha    i make homemade horse treats to spoil him extra, and we'll prolly ride.  especially this year, b/c it falls on a saturday....i love relaxing rides, but he likes to run sometimes too...so i just let him do whatever he wants    i also dont like the january 1st thing... :/|`|FWlSFpByaa	YES i celebrate all my pets birthdays, usually with special treats|`|KyHiCSKeaa	Yeah I do, I don't agree with the January 1st thing either!      My horses' birthdays are:  Gracie - May (I bought her from someone and only know the month)  Belle Starr - April 4 (she is Gracie's 3rd foal, my first live one (one with previous owner, one died from a weird chemical imbalance one day after birth, then Belle)    Unfortunately I don't know the dates of my other equines:  Clarice and Susita (full blood miniature mule sisters)  Burrito (their dad, a miniature donkey)  Rex (our full size donkey who was "donated" to our menagerie)  Feather (Belle's dad, he has papers that were never sent in by previous owners and I think lost)    I try to give them an extra treat on their birthday, but I can't get too extravagent or my dad gets mad...lol|`|bQ9LJcEoaa	It's up to u!|`|qBAHaGK0aa	i dont know my horses birthday, but i celbrate my friends horses birthdays :D  me and my friend are making a horse friendly, carrot cake for her ponys birthday :D  x
AA11992723	bless you for being a responsible loving pet owner by having him go to the vet. you would be surprised how many dogs are in worse shape but people dont get them any medical care at all. please feel good about your decision. she is in the best hands and will probably vomit it right up and given medicine. we all make mistakes. when i got my dog, she went in my backpack and ate a tylenol..that was an er trip too. live and learn and react fast and responsible. there are payment plans like credit care that can help you with the bill.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Mine pretty much did the same thing, but he threw up after eating the chocolate. He turns his nose up at it now, all the more for me. Your dog will be just fine.|`|T8OFsBUUaa	Well, it was taken care of quickly, and she was taken to the vet very fast, so I would say chances are good she'll survive with little problems in the future.    I guess don't leave the chocolate out?     I know when you see her happy and feeling ok you'll forget all about the money. She loves you, and was counting on you to do the right thing, and you did.|`|F2XxqlVfaa	screwed dude, your loosing your money AND your dog|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Its called responsibility for your actions. Get used to it you will need it the rest of your life.   Learn from your mistakes and move on.  I am sure your dog will be OK since your Mom got her to the vet.|`|SqWJCZyeaa	Chocolate isn't very healthy for dogs, like it isn't healthy for us. But, since you took care of it, I really think your dog will be okay. Just make sure you don't leave the chocolate out again!     Hope your dog is okay!|`|ssHzAVlwaa	whoa whoa whoa!!! thts pretty bad. chocolate cant be digested by dogs stomachs. hopefully the injection will help her get rid of all the chocolate she ate. My dog ate chocolate once before and was sick for 2 days. he vomitted a lot. but it was nearly 50g. I hope your doggy is ok.|`|ZnfZiZyzaa	yea my uncles a vet, soo. he should be fine. he will throw it up and will be okay. just keep him warm and quiet. my dog at coconut cream out of 2 hole cans. it was in the pantry and everything!!!! shes just smart. soo she should be fine.|`|velIdcbNaa	It's ok.  My dog has eaten a lot of  super dark chocolate and was fine.  My aunts dog (45 lbs) ate around 5 lbs of chocolate, and was perfectly fine.  Every dog is different, and can toletate different things so I can't say for sure.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Well, an emergency broken leg, the vet the orthopedic vet , surgery, treatment, recovery and BILL. That was pretty scary|`|pc7ZjexJaa	we have had our fair share of emergency vet trips    best thing to do...set aside a small amount of money each paycheck to an account for emergency vet trips    you'll be way better off      I've learned the hard way|`|Y6BFsic4aa	My dog Rufus (the dufus, goofus, you get the point) he ate all of my family's peanut brittle, a ton of cookies, and like 20 chocolate trifles! He lived though. Best of luck! I'll pray for you and your dog!|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Well you've managed to get her to the vets quickly which allows them to clean out the stomach through inducing vomiting, which you say they have already done. The toxins in Chocolate are well known to vets and I have known of smaller dogs who have ingested more than 50g and pulled through to be fine.     Don't panic, she's exactly where she needs to be!|`|3p6wp7DYaa	I am so glad this is not another clueless person asking what to do after their dog just ate their chocolate bar! Thank you for taking her to the vet right away and fixing the problem in a responsible manner. Or should I thank your mom instead? :)    Anyway, hopefully the dog will be fine after vomiting the chocolate. And you'll have learned a valuable lesson in life. You can't control what others do, just what you do. If you secure your chocolate stash in a responsible manner, your dog won't eat it and you won't have to pay a huge vet bill.     Good luck to you and your pup!|`|2mHbi6Exaa	my friend's dog once did pretty much the same thing. she lived through it. i'm sure your dog will be fine.|`|63OFiXmmaa	Aww thts sooo sad! But don't worry. I know tht this happened to a lot of ppl! So just dont worry and try to make her go to the bathroom. Some people buy pills for their dogs  to make them go to the bathroom so all of it comes out of her system.!     Hopefully she feels a lot better!!!|`|CjW9fiSHaa	ummm.... i really do not know. but my large dog ate a whole box of chocolates and he lived two more years. i hope that your dog is okay. i'm sorry about the vet bill. like i said, my dog ate a whole box and was fine.... i don't know about ssmall dogs. best of luck|`|BlpJnZOoaa	yes,my bunny has eaten oreos before but i wanted to say she has broke her leg so i was waiting till they got back from  our 2nd vet surgery visit she came back with a blue and big on her paw bandage now she is better if you want to see her go to you tube and search stair climbing bunnies|`|kNUcnqVOaa	i have a shih tuz dachshund her fav candy is reese now don't get the idea  we feed the chocolate but shes always gets into it and she has never been sick from it once she ate a whole easter basket and shes 14 years old and still getting into trouble  some dogs just get sick from it and some don't but since you acted quickly and took her to the vet i think she'll be ok|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Yes.  I have had 4 dogs in my lifetime & each one ate something they shouldn't.  The Basset Hound ate everything in sight, died aged 16 years. The Greyhound was a rescue & he ate the bitches poop & loved jelly babies.  I currently have an 8 year old whippet ***** who loves forbidden cheese & milk chocolate. I also have a 14 month old whippet puppy who has a fetish for paper & washing up sponges.  Your poor dog should be ok because she made it to the vets.  You need to hide anything like this from you dog.  I keep mine in a tall cupboard at the top or in the back of the fridge where they cannot reach.  Whippets are hard to hide things from because they are bouncy & thin & very very fast, that's why they are called Whip-its.|`|Zq4FEw0yaa	ummm...  yes oi think that she will be okay because if you took her to the vet he probably gave her an injection that will help alot.  no this has never happened to me but i have a wiener dog and he did get into some chocolate and the vet said that he would be ok.  but of course he only ate 1/2 of a hershey bar.  well i hope that i helped!!!!!!|`|a74cfe7d3b169985e25dc99f0dd9dcaeaa	I think she will be fine. Vets tends to save them.
velIdcbNaa	my cat eats my dog's food and she is fine.  Just squirt it with a squirt bottle every time you catch it doing it.  It should stop the behavior because ferrets aren't meant to eat dog food, and it could get sick, or choke.|`|TSQxwlbraa	Once in awhile if you dont catch it will be okay.  But I wouldn't allow it.|`|NArS7hYEaa	what kind of food is it? most dog foods are just plain grains and nutrients, witch shouldent hurt the ferret. If he keeps up, call your vet and ask about it.|`|3xhwfYKGaa	It's fine as long as it stops soon. If it didn't eat that much, it won't hurt him or her.   I had the same problem with my dog eating my rabbits food. I just moved my dog away from the rabbit food and i put the food in a place my dog couldn't reach it.|`|FoVPkF0Daa	unless the dog has a temper problem with sharing food and attacks the poor little ferret... then i guess it wont do too much harm just dont let him do it on a daily basis would be my guess...|`|7CtV0xuTaa	lol! i had the same problem so i split my parrot  from my dog and it worked.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	its fine|`|pvgwJwxvaa	dont leave the dog food out?|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	A nibble here and a nibble there will not hurt anything, unless the dog goes after the ferret.  You should not be encourage or replaced it as ferret food, I'm sure that will not be a problem.    If you have a lot of different animals around, just about every animal will try someone else food.  I have see the horses try the dog food ,and the dog eat the fish food, and more.

1tOr2qLAaa	Well from your title of the video, I think you know what he is doing, he has decided you are his mate, he is doing the same thing he would do to a female I have a male Goffins Cockatoo, that trys to do the same thing. It is a pain, I try to distract him with something else. It is breeding season till about March or April. I also just don't hold him quite as much right now and give him more toys to keep him busy elsewhere.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Sir William looks like he's trying to mate with you.  Some of my male budgies have done the same thing to my hand.  They rub their vent on my hand or fingers.  Your bird is wanting to mate.  I usually try to discourage this behavior, and place the bird on a playstand or back in its perch.  Some pet birds will perform this same behavior with their toys.  It's normal pet bird behavior.|`|rQlzfHqraa	It looks like he is trying to get into position to  mate.|`|eZHt4F1Oaa	to me he seems like he wants to mate, birds get all weird like that when they want to mate|`|uIk9MAnDaa	he is getting ready to mate|`|qeOlkRM0aa	As others have said, he could be trying to mate, but I'm not sure. He looked very fidgety. Generally speaking, most birds don't like standing on an open hand. Mine won't tolerate it. They much prefer having the hand vertical, so they can hold tight onto the finger and this in turn makes them feel more secure.
NBfBKI1Uaa	Go to Wal Mart and buy a small Styrofoam bucket and put the water and fish in it. Make sure that water is filled to the top. Close the lid tightly so that nothing spills. A betta will easily survive a 1.5 hour trip without a filter.    -rds|`|T6nmD3X9aa	flush him and get it over with now    have a good trip|`|gPYqGoZBaa	Go to petsmart and ask for an empty small fish bag.    As for the tank, be sure to keep the gravel and filter media wet during the trip.|`|wLbXsvAKaa	Put in in a bag fom a pet store or a cup like they use at the store. Then just keep the car at a normal tempature. He should be fine!|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	Just put him in a cup in the cupholder or you could put him in a cup and put that cup into a styrofoam cooler to keep the temperature the same.     I'd also bring some water from college so you can do a water change while at home|`|HihUntPmaa	I've noticed that in pet stores betta fish are usually just kept in a small see-through cup with water and a few air holes on top of the lid. Perhaps you should get one of those? It is more convenient than carrying the whole tank around.|`|AA11768780	Bettas are really tough..I used to put mine in a cup and put it in the cupholder! As long as your car maintains a normal temperature, he'll be fine.|`|8pWHCUa4aa	You could use a gallon water jug.  Buy one at the supermarket and put the fish in that and when you are at your parents house you can take the lid off or poke a hole in it and leave him in that while you are on vacation.  It is better than him having a small Tupperware container. I use the Crystal Geyser gallon containers, they come with a handy handle on the top.  You can pour 1/2 of the water out and fill it with the aquarium water, It will not hurt to leave your betta without a filter for a week or two, just make sure you change the water often.
an1L8njXaa	my first youngster was a 3 year old, that way he had she basics established (leading, loading, ground work but no riding). It gave me less chance to make a mess of things. It was a steep learning curve even then. So i wouldnt advise a foal thier needs are so diverse its very difficult to get it right if you dont have experiance. hvaving the 3 yearold and getting that horse, breaking it, schooling it and showing it when it turned 4 gave me the confidence to go for a yearling    Before that i had had many ready made older horses!    I would go for a 3 year old to start with, then once you have done that well, possibly think about a yearling. However if this is your first horse then get an older horse that will cope with any mistakes made. Getting a horse is a massive learning curve you do not need to add the additional steep learning curve of having a youngster. An older horse will tolerate mistakes and allow you to learn from them, a youngster will end up messed up if you make a mistake,.|`|UndOg7yeaa	im 16 i got my first filly when she was 10 months old. she wasnt broke to anything. since then she is now almost 2, she leads, picks up all feet, halters, she even lets me put a saddle on her ( no we dont ride her yet) just getting her warmed up to everything. if your confident you can do it get one thats about a year old or so,,,not to young,,,but not to old.    edit :  She also is broke to lunge.|`|yDgYSHvaaa	I would recommend not going COMPLETELY solo - get /some/ help. Or, if you are strongly opposed to doing that, at least remember to ask for help when you need it.  As for the horse, if you think you would be okay with a weanling, go for it. It would give you plenty of time for the year (minimum) of groundwork you should have before you start to ride.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	Not to be snotty about it but I would not consider buying the first horse 'off the line' of a first time trainer.  Go with an older horse and under the close supervision of a good, proven trainer.    Remember the Scripture that says, "the blind lead the blind and both fall into the ditch"|`|RPTwjyjIaa	When I was fifteen we got two foals and I trained them. I had already had a horse so I knew how to handle horses, and my mom and trainer were there with any help I might need. They were three months old and just weaned (they should have been weaned at five months). I worked with those foals every day and so I knew them. I knew what they were good at doing and what I had to work on. If they were lacking in an area it was my own fault and I could fix it. I would much rather work with a horse beginning as a foal rather than a one or two year old who can have lots of baggage or have been trained in a way I did not want. If you get a foal make sure it comes from parents that have a good temperament as this is usually passed down to the foal.    Oh and you should have an experienced horse person or trainer who would be willing to help or at least answer questions if you need it. You might not, but is always better to have one lined up just in case rather than trying to find one when you are in a bind.    Good Luck! :)|`|KyHiCSKeaa	If you have experience with handling horses, then I think the choice for a first time foal has more to do with temperment and previous training than age.  My first training experience was when I was about 12.  My pupil was a 2 yr old pony who had never been handled, not even had a halter on.  The thing that made the difference and made it work was that she had a great disposition and a loving personality; the other thing was that my dad was behind me every step of the way giving me tips, taking over when I couldn't handle her and being there to answer questions.  Those are the two biggest things I think are important.  A horse's temperment plays a key role in how they respond to you...especially as a first timer!    P.S. I almost forgot to tell you that until that point in my life I had had little to no experience with horses...the most equine experience I had had was with our miniature donkey...we got him as a weanling and kept him as a stud...he was a great training exercise for me!|`|ncFKreBsaa	get a 3 y/o bc u can train it and ride it tooooo ;)|`|yqKTPVwqaa	I'd go for a three or four year old, and get some professional help too.  If you get a weanling, you will be in college before you can start riding it.  Then you'll probably have to sell it.
n7bok7NRaa	He'll get along slightly better with a female. Another Tom may make him react badly, but all cats are very territorial, so you will need to introduce them correctly. There are many good reasources for that in the internet.    Just look up Cat behaviour.|`|4HvuxHPoaa	They'll get along pretty good. It may take a week or so but it would take a lot longer if it was two males.|`|3TjiJls7aa	Cats are a lot like people in that they can have extremely different personalities.  If both cats have been fixed they should not react too badly with each other.  Neutered males aren't more likely to react better with males or females.  When they first meet it is suggested to introduce the new cat to the area without the old cat there.  Then take the new cat out of the area and let the old cat smell around and notice that the new cat was there.  Then let the new cat into the area with the old cat.  They'll take some getting used to one another, but in time even if they don't cuddle they will at least tolerate one another!

3sB49YNnaa	She is close but how close is always hard to say.  An experienced breeder can detect when the pelvis starts to dilate but if you don't know what you are doing it is better not to try this.    My advice is just to sit back and relax.  The sow will do fine on her own.  Be sure that she and the pups are getting plenty of water, fresh 18% protein guinea pig chow with stabilized vitamin C, good quality grass hay and a moderate amount of greens.    Ignore the totally incorrect advice not to handle the babies!  You can handle them as soon as you want and as often as you want as long as you are careful with them and don't keep them away from mom so much that they can't nurse!  In more than 40 years and many hundreds of pups, I have never known a sow to reject a healthy pup.|`|lhmsAlQuaa	Here's some Info!    1. NEVER EVER TOUCH THE BABY'S cause this could confuse the scent of the baby's and the mother might not recognize its hers and she might abandon it or worse EAT it  2.Keep daddy away Daddy will eat them even if you didn't touch the baby's  3. Avoid cleaning the cage   4. wait till 2 weeks have pass sense they were born to pick them up But i recommend you wait till they are at least 6 weeks old to be safe  5. Make Sure the Hamster has the right type of bedding cause with the wrong bedding it could suffocate the baby's or end up with Asthma problems|`|va8xvhthaa	Hi :)     First of all, congratulations on the babies!!! :) Your guinea pig should be having babies in a few weeks or so. My guinea pig was pregnant, but strangely enough, she had no white drop. You should go to the vet to learn about what to do when you have baby guinea pigs, and ask them what's happening. Good luck. ;)|`|uvU5DnHcaa	Every sow is different ! To visually check her to see if she is ready you need to see if the membrane is still visible, they don't have a mucus plug. She will not have them until is is gone, and their water does not break either, The first sign is they can stop eating from 12 hours leading up to labor. and the bones under her tail bone will widen to about 1/2 inch. Once her bones part it can be anytime from 24 hours after she will have them.  The next signs is they will hunch their backs , looks like hick-cups. This is the first stage of labor when she is pushing them down in to the birthing position . If she is doing this for more than 30 minutes and no babies are born I suggest taking her to a vet as there may be a problem with the bubs being presented wrong, ie breach etc.   Most babies are born with in 2 - 5 minutes of each other, leaving only a short time for mum to eat the bag and lick clean to stimulate the bubs blood system.  Make sure she has fresh grass to eat all this time as it is essential they eat straight after birthing, Be sure to count the afterbirths as there should be one per bub ( that's if your there for the births ) She should eat them as it is natural for them to do so and for many reasons also.    Hope this helps...
bFzu835Aaa	I varies with each bird, some will tame down in a few weeks, others it might take a year or more before they're really comfortable.    You said LovebirdS- plural. That's going to make it harder. If you want them tame, separate them and work with each one individually. Together they're going to bond to one another much more than to you. They can have each other for reassurance, companionship, etc. Get another cage, and place each bird in a different room. Then work with them separately. It will still take time, how much is up to how well you're able to work with them and the individual bird. Lovebirds don't have to be kept in pairs, that's just an old myth. With attention, toys and good care, a single lovebird can be a perfectly happy pet.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	It took me a couple of months to just finger train my parakeets.  Don't worry yet.  Look for a couple of books online about training lovebirds or parakeets.  There's good info out there.|`|CdRlOsnyaa	give it time they will get comfortable
w1lh1INHaa	Winter wheat grass is a cat favorite, and is often packaged as "cat grass."  If you don't have it growing outside, you can get seeds and grow some in a sunny window.    My cats also like to nibble on fresh cat mint, baby spinach greens, and dandelion leaves.  The key to vegetation for a cat is the darker the green, the more they tend to like it.|`|4TX26viFaa	Wheat grass and oats are the typical types sold in the stores.
AA10883408	your dog is bored.  labs are working dogs and need lots of exercise.  they act out when you fail as a pet owner by not exercising them at LEAST 20 minutes a day.  take the time to take her on a vigourous walk EVERY day.  and fix the fence.    throw a ball for her, etc.  she needs to have a task.  you can put a small doggie back pack on her before you walk her.  let her keep your keys or some other small item in there at first.  she will feel like she has a job, which her breed needs.      i use a lab mix for a service dog.  he loves having a job to do, but he also needs his running time everyday.  i can't really get out and run with him, for obvious reasons, but i can take him to a dog park, throw the ball for him, etc.  he can run and play off leash at some dog parks, but he is well behaved and won't run off.    you just need to spend a lot of time with your dog and train her properly.  she is young and energetic and if you don't have time for her, rethink why you got a dog in the first place and make time for her. she is only acting the way her breed acts.  help her by accommodating her with activity.    good luck.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Put her on a run or get an invisable fence. The fence works great.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Find some sort of chicken wire, but more stable. Run it along the end.    Please do not use an electric collar or invisible fence. Thats just inhumane.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Fixing your fence is the common sense answer.    Boundary training with your dog, too. A well trained dog will not leave your yard, even if off-leash.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	fix the fence|`|C1eHfhrHaa	fix your fence or continue to walk her on a leash.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Fix your fence.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Build a bigger, stronger, taller fence.  Don't leave her outside unsupervised. If she is in season she may be hunting males to mate with.|`|3IApfZopaa	Get a big dog run and dedicate part of your yard to your dog, this way she'll be able to be outside without a leash and away from your neighbors yard.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	Keep your fence in good repair or keep her on a leash.  If you don't want to keep her on leash, fix the fence.|`|AA10704603	First of all, you are going to need to fix the fence ;)    I think your young dog needs two things: mental stimulation, and physical exercise. She need her body and her brain to be tired out. A tired dog is a good dog. Get her into an obedience or agility class, and make sure she is getting enough exercise.     If you are looking for a magic spray or collar that will keep her in, forget it. The dog tore down your fence- I'm sure she won't be bothered by a tiny shock or an unpleasant odor. Rebuild your fence, engage her in the things I mentioned above, and don't let her out unsupervised in the backyard for long periods of time. Boredom leads to destruction and wandering, as you've found out.     Good luck!  Erin
vbEkYH2haa	I think it could be mite related. Mites are irritating and cause the bird to over preen (causing bald spots) and also causes stress (causing more bald spots)     Get some mite and lice spray from your local pet shop or vet and give him a good spray all over and don't miss under the wings - he should be feeling better pretty quickly after treatment. you may need to repeat in 2 weeks or so to kill any eggs that have hatched.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	These bald spots can be due either to mites, poor diet, or stress.  If it's due to stress, your cockatiel may be plucking his feathers.  Mites can be treated with medication.  Diet can be improved by the addition of  fruits, vegetables, or vitamins.  I would advise getting your cockatiel examined by an avian vet.
m0e3a3gWaa	Awesome filter.  Ehiems are the best.  The filter being so quite that you have to put your ear to it is normal for ehiems.    The motor on the eheim 2213 is not strong enough to filter properly and go through the UV.    I suggest that you get a small power head, the smallest aquaclear ones are great for this.    You don't want the water flowing to quickly through the sterilizer or it won't work properly.  With the UV sterilizers its all about "contact" time for the water to be exposed to the UV light.  Also remember that the UV bulb needs to be replaced every 4 months or so.  Also, I love UV sterilizers. I have never had such crystal clear water!
8e4e5525d4c996bd34b95f4a6c4ef68daa	animals can have dry skin too. we thought my chihuahua cat dry skin and actually she has an allergy. our vet told us to give her children's benedryl. you're doctor may tell you the same thing. my cat however has Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome, basically the muscles in his back are having mini seizures causing him to be uncomfortable. kind of causing a burning/itchy sensation. he has to have cortizone shots every once in a while to help whenever it gets unbearable for him. but it will never go away.  but dry skin is possible, but more than likely will just have a skin allergy.|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	What are you feeding him?   If you are buying basic cat food from a grocery store then this is probably your problem.  Switch him to a premium food. You can find good brands at Petsmart, Pet Co, Pet Supplies Plus.....This is one of the big reasons cats have dry skin believe it or not.|`|AA10408696	I always thought the cat ads were fake until I used Purina one cat food,,   actually made my cats skin and fur look great,
w1lh1INHaa	It really depends upon which brand you buy.  Cheaper clay litters (which really are a waste and a mess) can run about $6-10 for a 20 lb. bag.  Then, there is tax on top of it.    Here's a hint -- have you ever heard of Feline Pine litter?  It is a great, long-lasting litter that is super at keeping odor down.  Now, instead, you can get pine/wood pellets (the kind you put into a wood pellet stove) for about $7 for a 40 lb. bag.  It is the same stuff as Feline Pine, way cheaper, and no tax.  So, I suggest you look into that for a great, inexpensive litter.  That is what I use, and the cats and I love it.  Plus, you can safely flush the poop down the toilet, and it is biodegradable, which is great for the environment.|`|4TX26viFaa	I get the cheapo WalMart brand in the red bag. It's 25 pounds of 'clay' litter for $2.59.  The clumping litters will be more expensive.  Don't get ones with a lot of 'odor control', the cats don't like the perfumes put into those and may refuse to use the litter.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	The cat litter I use (Fresh Step) is about $18 for a 40lb bucket.    14lbs - $6  21lbs - $11  28lbs - $14    Pretty cheap, and works well. :)|`|LxBwmRTlaa	It depends what brand and the size you'll be buying and also if you want to buy scented or unscented cat litter.. Cat litter ranges from $3.69 to $34.99 plus tax.|`|AwicI0VJaa	i normally buy a 35lb bucket for $13 at wal mart it's tidy cat multi cat
q5AuPTKJaa	Many reasons.   Some people really make me wonder what the f*** is going on in their heads, some of the stallions which should be gelded, and breeding from ol sway-back/ewe-necked/club-footed Bessy ...ummmm, coz she's really sweet.   Oh and don't forget "oh, we've got a mare, let's get her in foal - wouldn't it be soooo cute??!"   I know people who have put their rather ordinary mare in foal to ordinary stallions so their youngest kid can have it's own (ordinary) horse (forgetting of course there are thousands currently out there for a dime a dozen)  Grrr, hate back yard breeders contributing to the unwanted horse situation.  Having had my little vent...   There are breeders who only breed select mares to the best of stallions with the goal of creating the "ultimate" of their chosen breed, some as a commercial venture where the progeny are potentially worth a lot of money. A clear vision and plan (including QUALITY horses) and of course money is needed for this.  I'm all for selective quality breeding. There is not an excess at the top end of the market, it's just many people will never achieve the top end, many more simply can't afford it.   I'm against some of the larger scale hit-and-miss type programs where 50 + foals are born each year, a small few make it to the top, about half the remainder maybe sold to pony-clubbers etc, the rest somehow "vanish" ...dogged perhaps?? who knows - these people also contribute to flooded markets. And the back-yarders? Well, I said my bit.  I have often thought about giving up breeding and showing, and going into rescue for the reasons you mentioned. I didn't breed any of my own mares this season due to finance, time etc, and then in the current market will I ever be able to sell them for what they're worth? Who knows....  I agree, if you can't afford to look after it properly, don't have it.  Hey, thanks for the chance for a little whinge, lol! I needed that|`|zU1hrRIgaa	AHHHH! I know! I feel so horrible! I had 4 horses and had to sell one because i couldn't afford to feed them all. And my BEAUTIFUL QH mare with bloodlines, and amazing talent, TOTALLY bomb proof, was sold to this grumpy old guy who didn't really know a lot about horses. He ended up selling her at an auction for $400. I cried. This horse is worth at least $8000 if not more. And now she's prolly chopped up as someone's dog food.     ADOPT HORSES! PLEASE!|`|AtEIkzWYaa	I asked a similar question also. There really is quite a ton of good horses for cheap that are built nice and would make nice mounts. People think that bloodlines assure them of a quality   mount and like to brag on the money they spent on the horse. You can get a knuckle head with poor conformation even if you spend the bucks!  Because of the flooded horse market, this brings down the price of even the expensive horses. However.. I do think their are breeds that are  low in numbers and in demand, which make more sense to breed.|`|cLtzGveRaa	For me, and I do intend to breed, my goal is to preserve a specific bloodline of a horse that I love... and of which there are fewer than 1200 in the world.    The problem is not the responsible breeders.  It is the backyard breeders who think anything with a penis and a uterus need to be bred.  It is those who have a horse that is unrideable due to poor conformation so, rather than give her away as a pasture pet, they breed her.    I do agree... if you don't have a specific goal or purpose to breeding... don't breed.  Rescue a horse instead.|`|UndOg7yeaa	i agree with what you are saying. i have a 2 y/o filly who i probably never will breed. i bought her for $100 shes got a nice composition to her. I bought her as a companion trail riding horse only. I dont show or jump horses or anything. If i do ever breed her it will be way in the future and ill keep the foal she has. I know a pretty stud who throws excellent looking and built babies. but id say i probably will never breed her.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Very true if you want a tame horse here in UT all you have to do is take a bucket of grain out in the desert and shake it.|`|TSQxwlbraa	I totally agree. Tons of horses are going to auctions, being slaughtered, and abused because no one wants a poorly bred horse or cannot afford to take care of one. There are tons of horses out there that need homes. Unless you are a professional and have two absolutely PERFECT horses, then don't breed.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Because everyone thinks their animal is 'great' and deserves to reproduce, for some stupid reason or another.  Maybe they think their horse is 'pretty', or it's got a great personality, or whatever characteristic they like about the horse.  What they don't understand is that there are so many foals on the market they can buy one that's just as great as what they have for under $500 in pretty much every case.  People leave colts entire because they are an unusual color, or they know nothing about horse and think they're a good example of their breed because they're 'cute', or they're descended (distantly) from some famous stud.  80% of the studs I've seen lately should have been gelded and should not be reproducing.  Yet, their owners advertise them at stud and I'm sure offer a lot of coverings to similarly horrible mares with similarly uneducated owners.  Same concept as people breeding dogs- either they think their dog is great and want another the same, they think their dog 'deserves' to reproduce, they think they can make money doing it, or they're just incredibly uneducated and they think that because people on the street think the dog is cute that means it should pass on its genetic material, or they're incredibly stupid and allowed their female to be exposed to an intact male.  My favorite is the people who turn out their mares with a yearling colt and are surprised when they all turn up bred...  Or the ones that leave siblings together because they think that 'he won't breed her, that's his sister!'.  Go figure.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	If they own a breeding farm, they'd prefer to breed than to buy.  People have different opinions.  We are getting a foal soon from our mare.  We bought her bred.  She's a rare breed of horse.  we have a good cause.  We also MIGHT in 2 years breed our large horse.  She's a good horse, unfortunately unregistered, but sweet as pie, nice coat pattern, nice conformation, great dressage horse!  So, some live for breeding.  Some do it for fun.  Some hate it.  Now, when you have a registered mare, it's nearly better to breed her at some point.  It's best to breed a registered horse than a non-registered one!  (in case of disease!)|`|RrmeJqWLaa	Because people will di whatever they want to make a buck.|`|WVyP2I4saa	Well, I got into breeding because I wasn't able to have a horse until late in life, ended up with an Appaloosa mare that came with a breeding at purchase, and loved studying the genetics of the "color" breeding.  It was never a money making operation but a love of improving the breed itself.  I had many successes, one failure, and always kept my prices high no matter what the market.  That way, the person buying the horse had an investment to take care of, decreasing the chance of a bad outcome.  Most of my horses were two or three when sold and already trained to ride, which means I never made money. The problem comes from people "over" breeding, either to one popular stallion or just large herds of inferior horses.  There is a need for sound breeding practices that are not a part of the show or race world where money dictates the breeding choices.  The small breeder does it for love of the horse and improving the breed.|`|LaOGbBffaa	I think if you plan to just trail ride etc its great to save one.    However, if your into a discpline and you show a lot.. i'd much rather buy a horse i know has the bloodlines for it. (Buy from breeder)    I'd much rather buy a bred foal that has bloodlines i want, rather than get a horse that may or may not have the ability to do it.

c6Fz1B01aa	Rabbits are herbivores and can eat a wide variety of vegetables and fruit, as well as a balanced diet consisting daily of quality hay, a small handful once or twice a day of quality commercial dry mix, vegetales and/or fruit and fresh water. Gnawing blocks and gnawing toys will keep the teeth in shape.  However, some things should be avoided and others only given as treats, as they can become harmful if fed in large quantities.    Things to Avoid:  Avacado pear - toxic  Anything grown from a bulb - toxic  Evergreens - toxic  Dock leaves - toxic  Moss - toxic  Buttercups - toxic though alright in dried in hay  Rhubarb - toxic  Beetroot leaves - toxic.  Beetroot can be given but not the leaves  Tomatoes - can cause digestive problems  Corn on the cob - can cause digestive problems  Spinach - causes bladder stones  Anything you pick from your garden and cannot identify is not worth the risk - when in doubt, leave it out.     Things to be given in very small quantities only as treats:  Lettuce - becomes toxic in large quantities  Green Apples and citric fruit - acid and may cause mouth sores and make their motions loose  Alfalfa hay - rich in sugars which can cause stomach upsets  Kale - high in oxylic acid, but not as much as spinach  Parsley - high in oxylic acid, but not as much as spinach    These are the main things to avoid or only to be given as treats.

My obedience club is sponsering the Rally events for the Premier this June.  And I will probably be showing there myself :c)    I haven't done UKC myself, but I do have friends that do, so if we get an email line of communication going, I can get you all the answers you will need.|`|QajuWPzxaa	i would google the UKC and see what u can find about the qualifications and other stuff like that!|`|024lJBZ4aa	You can usually find the information for the upcoming UKC Premier in June 2009 on the UKC website at http://www.ukcdogs.com  Usually, when it's ready, you'll be able to download the premium and entry forms for Premier.    It may be a little early for the info to be up yet.  You don't need any qualifications to enter the show.  It's just a big dog show, offering:  conformation, agility, rally, protection, obedience, terrier races, weight-pull and dock-diving.  The top dogs in breed, obedience, agility, weight-pull etc are invited.    Their are no prior trials that you have to attend.  You must pre-enter.  There is no day of show entry.  It's just to big of a show and day of show entries would just cause chaos.    I attended the UKC Premier in 2003 with my mixbreed.  We competed in agility and we finished a title at that trial.      Information will also be posted in upcoming UKC Bloodlines magazine.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Contact UKC for exact dates, but typically entries open up in March and close in May. The event is held in June.     There are special invitees based on yearly rankings, but any dog registered with UKC is eligible to participate in the show. It is a pre-entry only event and usually fills up quickly.|`|6cD9Ig2oaa	I don't know. My only suggestion is to find a local breeder that deals with the UKC and ask them. I'm sure you've searched the internet, so that ideas out :)
AA11378099	Buy a hamster cage that has wires for walls rather than plastic.  They are better for ventilation during the hot summer months for your hamster.  Also make sure you have a hamster wheel and a water bottle when you purchase a hamster cage.|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    I'm actually a huge proponent of bin cages!  I'll list a bunch of info below but I'd like to correct a little mis-information really quick :)    Hamsters LOVE to climb - it's exercise, it's good for them and they LIKE it.  Don't try to stop them - it's one of the ways they like to get from one part of a cage to another.      Here's the bin cage info (they're big, easy to make - well, you'll see!)    Bin cages are the best way to house hamsters, whether they're Syrian (Teddy Bear, Honey Bear, Golden, Panda) or Dwarf (Russian, Winter White, Roborovski or chinese).    I personally think they allow the most creativity while still giving your hamster room to move around.  Almost every breeder I know, and most rescue groups will tell you they're the best way to go as well :)    They're virtually escape proof because the sides are so tall, and there's SO much more room for your hamster (or hamsters if you have dwarfs) to move around in.  You can load them with toys and still put in fun tube arrangements for them to play in. There's more space to change things around - hamsters get bored easily so moving and changing out their toys is important in keeping them active and entertained!       You should use a large, bin that's transparent - no dyes (ie colors) because the chemicals could hurt your pet if they chew on it.    Here's an idea of what the best type of bin should look like, and the size you'll want to look for, it doesn't need to be this particular brand, but this is they type you'll want:    http://www.rubbermaid.com/rubbermaid/pro...

If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask me!     Daisy :)|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	Hamster cages depend on how big or small your hamster is. If it is a small one, I would suggest not getting a wired one. Instead get a plastic one, or an aquarium. If you get an aquarium, but on the top a screen with holes to breathe, but not too big holes. Then put a brick or something heavier on top to hold it down so your hamster doesn't get out. If you hamster is bigger, you can go to a store and get one with wires. Just make sure the wires on the cage aren't too spread apart, or else the hamster will try to escape.|`|lhmsAlQuaa	i would go with the plain glass ones   Reason: Because Hamters can not climb on flat plain glass and Hamsters tend to climb|`|aDeDOmxBaa	Completely agree with logan,    all my hamsters have done the same. If you go to a fish/ aquatics shop you can get very good deals on quite large fish tanks. As long as you have no cats/dogs you can keep these without the lid on. But it has to be tall as a hamster will climb on objects to get out! And they can jump too!    Tanks work well because you can fill them with lots of shredding so hamsters can burrow like in the wild. Again keep an eye on how tall it is or get one with a lid and drill air holes in it. Dont get one with a light or filter fitting!     Cages are so unnatural and they will climb up the bars, pull all sorts of stunts and can injure themselves!      You get a great view with a glass tank. Hope this helps,    Gem x|`|hqlnUXIraa	I have a honey bear hamster too and I have him stay in a clear plastic container that is just the right height and width. He has plenty of room that is open and free. Also, it is SO easy to clean. Just wash it out with hot water, dry, and put the bedding in. That simple.
I7V1GwS1aa	What type of dog is it?  Also there;s a lot of things you can get from petstores for inbetween baths.  You can use whips, and different sprays that help with smell, and coat/skin conditioning.|`|SqWJCZyeaa	You should brush her more than you bathe her. Keep it clean where your dog spends the most time at. Keep her blanket clean and smelling nice. Keep her bed nice smelling and clean. Has she been getting sick on herself?|`|KYC0pmH6aa	A dog naturally smells...that's natural. Try getting new special shampoo. If it's REALLY unhealthy bad see a vet. There may be a health problem.|`|AwicI0VJaa	brush her than wash her really well doing a double shampoo|`|18uFvmFDaa	Actually,  Bathing washes off the good skin that keep the dog from smelling.  All I can say is BRUSH BRUSH BRUSH! Brushing brushes away the bad and stinky fur and leaves the clean stuff!   But if is really bad bath again but don't do it too often... My vet told me once a month!  Hope this helps!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Has she seen the vet? Any new dog should have a wellness check at the vet. Discuss the skin problem|`|Eug52iQDaa	First, take her to a vet to check her skin.  Remember, that when you do wash her, it shouldn't be more than every few weeks, and with a very gentle shampoo that is meant for dogs.      She could smell because of skin, anal glands, or the food she's eating.    Oh dear.. It just occurred to me - dirty.... does this dog have fleas?  Please take her to the vet, sweetie.  If she has enough fleas to cause 'flea dirt' she needs to be helped immediately.     Also look for a food that does not have wheat, corn or soy in it.      I bet a visit to the vet and a change of food will make her a much happier girl and easier to be around.    Best wishes.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	maybe she has a skin infection.  take her to the vet.|`|fjkRIUSnaa	i would wash her in a scented soap and keep washing her and her blanket until she and it come clean. otherwise consult a vet|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Take her to the vet there has to be a logical explanation.  Your dog should only be bathed once a month.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	I'd say that you're feeding her a very poor brand of dog food, and her body is reacting accordingly.    Poor dog foods (like Purina, Alpo, Ol' Roy, etc) will cause your dogs skin and coat to produce MORE oils that it otherwise would. Feeding scraps and milk products can do this to an animal as well.    I suggest switching her diet to something that ISN'T sold on Walmart shelves, and bathing her properly with a shampoo directed towards her coat condition.     Consult with your veterinarian about a possible yeast infection in the ears as well.|`|QajuWPzxaa	wash her with a fresh smelling flea shampoo...it will get down deep to the skin and clearly wash out all the yucky stuff! i use flea wash all the time with my pomapoo..(pomeranian/poodle) and he has very thick surly hair that is regularly long...he always comes out smelling fresh!!|`|M3H4NtrAaa	It probably has a fungal infection. Take it to the vet.
OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    When it comes to your dog's health, the single most important thing you can do for your pet is make sure she gets her shots. Many of the most dangerous and infectious canine diseases we know of can be easily prevented with safe and effective vaccines.  here's more info:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=017306798010...    hope this helps.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Ask the vet.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Many protocols recommend that the first vaccination be only a core combo vaccination of Parvovirus, Distemper, and Adenovirus-2. The second and third vaccinations include the remaining non-core vaccinations and what is included in those would depend on where you live and what sort of exposure risk your dog is expected to have.
rLDf1gGGaa	Remember a small breed isn't recommended for young children because they are incrediable fragile and can easily be killed by being dropped on the patio, they are also likely to be more tempermental and more likely to be snappy.they are suitable for older considerate children, and a reputable shelter generally won't rehome a small breed adult dog to children 10years old+, some shelters may rehome a small breed dog to children 8years+, Larger dogs are BETTER with small children and are more tolerate and patience with the typical roughness of children.    Unscarred Children (and Adults).  If a puppy does not teeth on your possesions, it will teeth on you and your children. Rescuers often get calls from panicked parents sure their dog is about to seriously injure their children.  It usually turns out the puppy is just doing what puppies do, i.e., mouth or nip. Parents, too emotional to see the difference, just want to get rid of the dog.  A growing puppy is going to put anything and everything in their mouth. It must be taught bite inhibition. As the puppy grows, the puppy's jaws become stronger and its teeth are replaced by its adult teeth.  The mouthing and nipping it did as a puppy now can have serious consequences.  Far better to get an adult dog 2year+ that has "been there, done that, moved on."    People on yahoo answers generally suggest their favourite breed, NOT what actually suits you.    Yorkshire Terriers   are NOT suited to children, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Yorkshire Terrier who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Most Yorkshire Terriers feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and fearfulness (even defensive biting) may be the result.    Pugs -Remember children tend to poke and prod, a pug eye will  easily fall out,  is a blind dog good with children?No  Small children and pugs are not a good combination. While pugs are not generally aggressive dogs, young children tend to be fascinated with their curly tails and bulging eyes. Pugs eyes are very sensitive and easily injured, and having their tails pulled can make even the most easy-going pug snap at the person who is doing the pulling.    Boston Terriers  Temperament:  Highly intelligent, alert, and enthusiastic, the Boston Terrier is affectionate and loyal. This breed is quite animated and has a lovely sense of humor. They thrive on human interaction and on being an integral part of the family. They do best in a home with children over the age of eight years and are exceedingly good with the elderly. They will generally get along with non-canine pets, although males may fight with other dogs. The Boston Terrier has a very sensitive nature and will be affected either positively or negatively by tone of voice or the home atmosphere and environment.    Westie  I do NOT recommend terriers for small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children.    Cavalier king Charles  If you have small children, I do not recommend Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies, no matter how well-meaning the child. Small children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Cavalier puppy who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Even Cavalier adults may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness may be the result.    Bichon Frise  Bichon Frise puppies are NOT suited to small children, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Bichon Frise puppy who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Even Bichon Frise adults may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness (even defensive biting) may be the result.    pomeranian  If you have small children, I do not recommend a Pomeranian. There are just too many Poms who won't tolerate any nonsense. And there are too many Poms who feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness (even defensive biting) may be the result.     Dachshund  If you have small children, I do not recommend a Dachshund. First, children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Dachshund puppy who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. The Dachshund's long back is especially fragile and prone to damage when he is picked up incorrectly or dropped. Second, even Dachshund adults may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness may be the result. Finally, some Dachshunds simply do not tolerate any nonsense from children and will bite if pushed too far.     poodle  Temperament:  One of the most popular breeds in the world, the Poodle is loyal and deeply devoted to their owner and family. They thrive on human companionship and are extremely sensitive to their familys moods and emotions. The Poodle may become overly attached to one particular family member and suffer from separation anxiety. The Standard and Miniature varieties are typically more amiable than the Toy |`|pvgwJwxvaa	do not get a small breed dog .  they do not do well with small children.  just go to the shelter and see which dog you like.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	go to www.petfinder.com and look at your local shelter to see what they have.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	http://www.petfinder.com    Look at the dogs available in your local shelters and research the breeds for yourself.    A puppy is generally not a good idea for a large household (you only listed five kids- yet there are seven?). A small breed dog is even worse. Smaller breeds tend to nip at children, a medium sized dog would be best for your household.     Do NOT expect to find a puppy at your shelter the first time you go. Research before buying or adopting ANYTHING. Knowledge is far more important than having that fluffy ball of happy in your lap.|`|yLwKWzIUaa	Well first of all if you want a puppy, they're A LOT of work. i'd recomend trying to find a low energy (ie not a border collie etc..) 2-3 year old dog at the shelter. however, if you really want a puppy that's great, but be commited to care for and train the puppy, again, this takes a lot of time. you should also register for dog obedience class. they're a lot of fun and you learn a lot.  good luck finding the perfect dog/puppy!  oh, and as for breed, don't get a puppy just becuase it's a certain breed or it's cute. find a dog/puppy whose personality you like, regardless of the breed :)|`|KxjUim7yaa	Do you have the time to devote to potty training? I think not. Be aware that younger children under age of 6 are not recommended to have a dog. A small breed is not suitable at all. Best dog for the family is a big friendly dog, potty trained that was raised with kids. A mixed breed might fit. Go to the shelter to select. Personnel can help match you to a good family dog.|`|Au0HK3O6aa	If your house is huge it could well accommodate a big dog.  A mongrel is probably the best type to get as they are really hardy and usually not sickly. But I  would advise that you all go to the shelter and see what is on offer.    A young dog who is not a puppy but is a little trained would be the ideal as it takes time to train them and if there is loads of kids around it may be confusing for the poor dog until he gets to know you all.      We had a big collie X german shepherd when my kids were small and he was a beautiful calm but loyal dog to all the kids. He never once was aggressive to them and looked after them.      Whatever you choose enjoy it and look after it as it will reward you for years for saving it from death.|`|AwicI0VJaa	Pugs are very lovable dogs, they love people and getting it as a puppy the dog will adapt to its surroundings.

Personally I would go to the local rescue shelter & see what they have to offer.  Often a mutt is best with children of any age & you could be surprised & find a perfect specimen for you all to love.  Have a look on the internet & see what the shelter you are visitng has to offer they often have photographs on the website so you can see what is available.  Good luck.|`|eFEC8qrOaa	I think that a pomeranian would be good for a dog in the family. They're really cute and fluffy.

Adopting from a shelter is a GREAT thing THANK YOU!!!|`|9ANfcQKCaa	A small dog in a big family is not fair cause everybody wants to be with the dog. Alot of time the small dogs are very keen on one person, so I would keep my mind open to a larger breed dog. Like a LABRADOR they are great with kids and love to fetch and swim, they can be active with your family or mellow by your bed at night. I say Lab again because they are super easy to train. Training is probably going to be important since there are so many in the house. Our lab was 7 weeks old when we brought him homw and completely potty trained by 11 weeks old.   The shelter you can never be sure what you will find so be open minded...  Good luck|`|qjR8Pwhcaa	I think a Yorkie would be great for you they are great for young children and large families.    I know a Labrador is a big dog, but they are great with children.Labrador mixes, and Females are not as big ,or as bad.    I really think a Labrador and Yorkie mix would be the best for you.    Puppies are not good for first time owners and are harder to take care of.So I think a dog age 2 or older would be the best.|`|AhvLtbA3aa	I like big dogs the best...but if you want a little dog then go for a bishon-poodle mix, mini poodle (teacup), dauxies work well too.   If you want a bigger dog then go for St.Bernard ( AMAZING with kids!) Lab, or mabie a husky.  Dogs NOT to get: Mini Pinsher, Shitsue,Jack Russel or any other really hyper breed!   For big dogs: Pitbull, rottweiler, german shepard. I love all of these big dog breeds and I own 1 of each (except for theShepard'ss I own 2) but if you get them from the shelter then there could be some in-breeding involved. There are alot of idiots out there that just use these dogs for fighting. If you find a sweet one (witch is very likely) then go for it!  REMEMBER:   1.There is nothingg wrong with getting your average mutt! Some of the best dogs are not pure bred.   2. Do your Researchch on these breeds. You do not want to walk into something that you can't handle.   3. Look around! Don't limit yourself just to one shelter! There are plenty of options out there with lots of dogs. ( I like no kill the best)   Enjoy your new family member!      If you have ANY problems then just ask this trainer:  http://bakerdogbehavioralcentre.ca/baker...|`|EBeUj5tuaa	Bichon Frise they dont shed  Schnauzer there are 3 kinds mini,standard, and giant and they dont shed  Any kind of mutt is fine   Thats good you are going to a shelter!!!|`|SeUFlsawaa	I have three dogs, one that I got from a shelter.

They are good dogs and very loyal.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	take everyone along to the shelter. your dog will find you.|`|SqWJCZyeaa	I think you may want to try A labrador retriever. They are great family dogs and are friendly, easy to groom, average hair shedders, and love being with the family. They have a lot of patience and love people. They are great dogs. Especially with a big family! You really really shouldn't get a small dog. They are often very aggresive with small children. Especially Chi-wah-wahs (my special way to spell it) and Yorkies. You should probably avoid a german shepard too.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Try a yorkie, they are sweet and fun to play with.  requires grooming unless has a short cut.  or    a minu poodle, really smart.  Not TOO much grooming, unless fur grows out.  or    Pomeranian, nice and georgous.  Requires Grooming.      Good luck with your new pup.|`|3TjiJls7aa	When you get a new pet from the shelter, I think the most important thing is to not go in with any breeds in mind.  The dogs there all need a home and come from many different backgrounds.  Because of this they might not even have the same temperament as is usual for their breed.  It would be best if all of the kids could go there together.  Meet as many of the dogs there as you can.  Try to find one that is not intimidated by the younger children, but also not aggressive towards them.  Use your best judgment but ask questions as well!  Usually the people working at the shelter are volunteers who have spent a lot of time with the animals and can give you a good idea of what to expect from them.  Good luck!!!|`|3p6wp7DYaa	If you have lots of space, why not go for a larger dog instead of a small breed of dog? Toy breeds are not usually well suited for a household with small children.    If you are a very active family who lives in a big house (not too many neighbors around to be bothered by the howling and barking) I would go for a beagle or a beagle mix.  They are great with children, very active and playful, and they will always be up for some good fun in the yard.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	It is very uncommon to have 2 males together. They will usually fight to the death. I have heard of some who have managed it but you just never know. They are pretty much solitary fellows and like their own territory. This is not something I would try and I have 3 males and 2 females.|`|kBek6QCLaa	no, adults males will fight over territory|`|eS8wuYRfaa	They can live together, but it's VERY rare.

JwhvqbxJaa	i would use a pitch black gravel. this will really make colors pop. get some black slate on ebay or from a garden shop. to test is it is safe, wash it and then put a drop of vinegar on it. if it sizzles it is not safe. if nothing happens it will work. i would use silk plants but i prefer real plants.also add some driftwood. as long as you soak it for two weeks or boil it for two hours it makes a fine centerpiece. and the black gravel with a black background will make the fish really pop. as for the plants i would look into getting real plants. just google it. hope your tank looks great!!!!    El Jacko|`|hKXIeur6aa	I would go for a brown gravel, preferably something dark. A well placed piece of driftwood does wonders for a tank. Also, use lots of silk plants, plastic looks harsh and, well, fake.

I'd also get live plants.     Maybe some drift wood too
4TX26viFaa	Cockroaches are around food more than water, so leave the water out for your cat.    I lived in an apartment for quite a while. Your best bet is to get yourself some plain old Borax, pour it into an empty jar lid like an old pickle jar lid, and mix a little bit of sugar in with it.  The roaches eat it, the stuff bubbles up inside them and they die.  Slide the jar lid under the fridge, or under appliances, anywhere that your cat can't hook it out with a paw out of curiosity.  The stuff is good roach control.    Keep your cat's water there 24/7, she needs it.  But wipe down counters and any food areas, to avoid feeding the roaches.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	If you feed her the proper food then she won't really need the water. Cats are not normally big drinkers but are forced to drink because people feed kitty crack. They cannot possibly drink enough water to make upo for the lack of moisture in dry foods. Please do your research        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...

Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|3TjiJls7aa	While your cat would probably be okay without water just overnight, I don't think there is any reason that water would benefit cockroaches.

DLxh9CANaa	Abby, first of all, horses need a tetanus shot EVERY YEAR, because a single vaccination DOES NOT PROVIDE lifetime immunity. I don't know where you got that idea from, but it's NONSENSE. If your mare has not had a tetanus shot since she was a foal, you need to re vaccinate her, and do it QUICKLY, because the next time the mare steps on something or gets a cut, she's going to be at serious risk of getting this disease, which is usually FATAL to both horses and people alike. Most of the sleeping sickness vaccines are sold as combinations- it's almost impossible these days to get vaccines for just that disease alone and no other, unless you are talking about something like the rabies vaccine. Have you even TALKED TO YOUR VET, Abby, and asked him or her which shots your horse REALLY NEEDS, and how often? Do you KNOW WHICH diseases are endemic ( which is a way of saying they occur naturally and are present in the environment your horse lives in all the time) to your area? If you answered no to either of these questions, I'd hold off on giving your mare anything else until you at LEAST TALK to your vet first. Giving too many vaccines at one time, or giving them in the wrong dosages, is a recipe for disaster, Abby. Also, are you aware that many states have LAWS which PROHIBIT the administration of vaccines by anyone other than a vet? Have you checked to see if your state is one of these? I used to live in Georgia, and that state prohibits anyone other than a licensed vet from giving rabies shots, and there are other states which prohibit laypersons from giving other vaccines, such as those for tetanus and flu, for example, or strangles vaccine.     The best person to ask about all this stuff is your vet- and you also need to get him or her to outline a vaccination schedule for your horse which will provide maximum protection with a minimal amount of discomfort and stress for her. In most parts of the US and Canada, horses generally need the following vaccines each year: WEE, EEE, VEE, tetanus, flu, rhino, West Nile Virus, and depending on the region where the horse lives, vaccinations against strangles, Potomac Horse Fever, and botulism may also be necessary. And EVERY HORSE needs an annual RABIES SHOT, regardless of the region he or she lives in. If you are planning to show your mare, you need to ask the vet to do a Coggins test when he or she comes to give the mare shots,because you will need proof of a negative Coggins in order to be able to compete in recognized or sanctioned shows.     Don't get me wrong here- I vaccinate my horse myself too, and so do most people I know, as a cost saving measure. But it's up to you, Abby, as the owner of a horse, to know and to follow your state's vaccination laws and requirements- and it's difficult to do that if you don't know what they are. Your mare needs far more protection than she's been getting, especially if you plan on showing her. Tetanus is a FATAL disease in horses- I had a friend once who actually knew a horse which contracted lockjaw ( the other name for the disease) and died of it. It's not a pretty sight. So I would ask your vet to help you, before you go any further. One last note: Prevenile vaccine is a prescription product- you'll have to get that from your vet.     Good luck.|`|UX4BOaataa	It won't hurt her to have the combo with Tetanus in it. I volunteer at a reascue and we usually give EWTs whether we know their history or not.     Usually Jeffers Equine or Country Supply are good places to check online, however you may even be able to but them from Tractor Supply.|`|px27V5N9aa	You should also do the follow up of the Tetanus too, it won't do any harm.

Tetanus should be given yearly, anyways.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	you do know that tetanus needs to be given annually?|`|HXVaqUjXaa	If you know what your doing how come you don't know that tetanus is an annual shot?

And remember tetanus is annual, just like EEE/WEE.|`|1BJtTl8Baa	you can purchase vaccines from many farm/feed suppies-Tractor Supply is one, and as the others answered it is normally included in the EEE/WEE/TET
2YIxnXXyaa	Red eared sliders are NOT aggressive.  Just towards fingers because they mistake it as worms.  And open flesh because that's in their nature..it's food for them.    They should be fine.  I have a 2000 gallon pond in my backyard with 7 teen/adult red eared sliders, a cooter and two soft shells.  I put the baby who was the size of a half dollar, and they didn't touch him.    Water turtles aren't normally aggressive towards their own kind, unless they have a cut or an open wound, then the other turtles will nip and bite at it, and in some cases eat it.  So just make sure he's all unwounded and it should be great.    However, SOME water turtles can be aggressive, and that's just how they are.  Everyone's different and they all have personalities.  Try it out, keep an eye out the first few days, maybe take the baby one out at night, and then gradually just leave him in there.    Good luck.|`|F9NhDpoxaa	i try it before, the older one went on top of the little one...(most of the time)|`|wCcioHqVaa	You should wait till they r bigger when we put my brothers half dollar size turtle in with my 6 in one mine bit the little ones foot off|`|lJYvGLKLaa	RES are very aggressive turtles.

iXijnCxOaa	The canine to the rear is a baby tooth.  You can tell because it is slightly translucent and is much narrower than the new tooth coming in to the front.    Please realize that many pups will retain the puppy tooth until the adult canine is fully in.  I believe this is nature's way of making certain the puppy can rip/tear its food (since a raw diet was normal up until 60 years ago).    Edit: It should loosen as the new tooth continues to grow in.  Most of the time these teeth come out while the pup is chewing or playing tug...sometimes its quite bloody when they come out (with Samoyeds they often lose them while wrestling with one another and you end up with the other wrestler covered with blood which is a bit disconcerting)  I've never had one retained beyond 6 months of age...    The extra tooth will come out sometime within the next few weeks.  In the meantime, give the puppy plenty of things to chew on.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	At five months old, the teeth losing game has only just begun.    What you see in that photograph is a retained tooth, and as the new roots begin to take place, the old tooth will fall out. Provide teething toys and plenty of "hard" toys to stimulate the gums and help aide on the teething process and your animal will be fine.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	It does look exactly like a retained deciduous tooth. It would not necessarily be loose, by this stage they're often wedged tight. Why on earth doesn't your vet believe you? Show them! I'd say you made a mistake before and that his teeth hadn't already come out.    Chalice|`|3zv2bbolaa	Your dog has a retained deciduous (baby) canine tooth. If it doesn't fall out on it's own, it will need to be removed by your vet. Chances are high that it will come out within the next few weeks.|`|2284892d397da9e7d9297a73b92bd630aa	My 4 1/4 month rottie is having the same problem with all 4 canines. The more slender tooth behind the other in your pic is a baby tooth. Perhaps your pup lost another tooth which looked similar? It looks exactly like my pup's. Yeah, I was told the same thing but I read that if the baby teeth take too long to fall out it can mess up the dogs bite (top and bottom teeth won't match up correctly) and then the puppy teeth will have to be surgically extracted! Yikes! This same thing oddly enough happened to me as a kid!    Whew, glad other people know about this cause I was gettin worried myself! I keep looking in my puppy's mouth to see if her teeth are loose yet, worried mom:)|`|pvgwJwxvaa	retained baby teeth.  it should fall out on its own.  very rarely do big dogs have to have them removed.
pspRQ9KAaa	Out of that list, I would choose either the Eclectus or the Goffin Too.    Eclectus rarely if EVER bite. However they are not the most dependent bird and thus you can't really "cuddle" with them.    Goffin cockatoos are great. However when they bite, they bite HARD. Not to mention they are just like their subspecies, Umbrella Toos. Meaning they WILL have mood swings. And they WILL be unpredictable.      If it was my decision I would go with a macaw. Strictly because they are cuddle bugs & very predictable with their body language. I chose my Greenwing over a Goffin and I have never nor ever will regret my choice.    GOOD LUCK! And please share pics when you get your feathered friend. :]|`|v7nHhYRwaa	The Red Lored Amazon, they are cool.

2kjGc7xvaa	what you are doing is fine...feed the fish and just make sure there is not a lot of excess (seems as if you already have that down). Vac the tank atleast once a month and that will get rid of debris in your tank that has accumulated. I'll be honest with you, and a lot of these "experts" on here might disagree, but it is foolish to try and scoop out any uneaten food every time you feed your fish. One, you are putting a net into the tank and sloshing around trying to scoop the little particles, not healthy for the fish. Second, you will end up disturbing the decor more than needed. Three, if you feed the right amount the little excess won't matter, there should be enough beneficial bacteria in your tank to take care of the ammonia produced from the decomposing food.|`|wLbXsvAKaa	Useually you clean out uneaten food after 15 minutes, but if your fish keep comeing back to get more, I would just vacume your gravel every month. That should be eanough if your fish eat the food after it touches the bottom.
O545aSKWaa	$50 a day sounds pretty reasonable.

wrUsMG4Jaa	Humane society's do not crop ears.     Its likely that the animal is already too old to have to procedure done (generally its done before the animal is three months old), thus you are wasting your time looking.     "Cheap" should NEVER be in the same sentence as any type of cosmetic surgery. If done improperly, your dog could be maimed for life. If you can't afford a proper surgeon to do it, then live with floppy ears.    ETA> People who think the procedure is unnecessary and barbaric need not apply. The procedure is done in many breeds to prevent infection, and for the comfort level of the dog. If you don't know what you're talking about, please lead yourself to a website better suited for you (ie: Myspace.com).|`|3giaPYe8aa	They don't crop ears at a Humane Society!|`|KYC0pmH6aa	What is wrong with a natural dog? I mean, unless you feel OBLIGED to do so, I say keep em hangin.    Quite frankly I think cropped ears look almost scary.    Unless you have a reason like health issues or your showing the dog.    (But I still think they shouldn't have to be cropped to show)    Sorry that I didn't give a real answer, I just feel it's wrong.|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	It's cruel and completely unnecessary.  Leave your dog's ears ALONE.  The HUMANE society wouldn't do it for you.  And if you want to go cheap, you're asking for a botched job.  Don't try and make your dog look "mean" or "cool."  Leave him whole.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	The *humane* society vets would never do an ear crop.  And for "cheep," visit the local bird aviary.    I have nothing against cropping, but "cheep" and "humane society" in the same sentence tells me that you probably aren't 1. old enough to be worried about this and 2. that you are not mature enough either.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Why would you want your dog's ears cropped?  People only do that for fighting dogs, and unless you want people staring at you like you're a stupid F, I suggest not.  Would you like your ears cropped?  I think not.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Ok- for ear cropping, cheaper is not better.  Find out who your breeder used for a vet and use the same one.  If your dog is more than 4 months old, it is too late anyway.  The aftercare is a B****, so unless you are 100% committed to the aftercare, your money will be totally wasted.  I am 100% certain they do not do cosmetic surgery at the humane society.|`|TSQxwlbraa	Ear cropping?  Why would you want to do that?|`|pvgwJwxvaa	why would you want to have the ears cropped?  if your dog is over 12 weeks, its too late and with ear crops, you get what you pay for.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Are you real? Where is your common sense?  After a puppy is 12 weeks old it is MAJOR PAIN, if you go for this option then you will get a very large vets bill if you can find a vet willing to carry cosmetic surgery out.  If you are not happy with your dogs ears then you should not have bought the dog.  I have a pedigree WHippet puppy who is now 14 months old & even though one of her ears sticks up at a weird angle I would not get her ears fixed, she is beautiful enough as she is.|`|0a07f2e5a084ebc8ae39f790612c5390aa	For everyone who says is a Cruel and Unnecessary have you ever had a dog that has had there ears cropped? Do you know what breeds get there ears cropped? Probably not i would say if you dont know what the hell your talking about dont comment on it, its a choice by the owner and alot of breeds it a breed standard for example Schnauzers get there ears cropped for the look.. My Pit Bull has his ears cropped they do it when they are weeks of age so they will never remember it and its not that Cruel.. Honey the human society will not do it you might want to get a hold of a breeder online who breeds dogs that need ears cropped they may give the info of the person who does it.. Usually the breeder doesnt do it him or herself they have someone from the outside do it I would contact a Breeder and see if they can give you the info..

Second of all- it's a dominance thing.  Third of all, get your dog spayed.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	What to do:    Get her fixed.

Your dog is trying to dominate you because he doesn't think you are reliable or responsible enough to be in charge.    Maturity doesn't enter into it - not your dog's and certainly not yours.    By the way,  no such thing as a "mini" rat terrier, there's just one standard for the breed - also, why isn't she spayed?    Just push her off, tell her a firm "no", do not let her dominate you by humping - and get her spayed (I know I said that already, but it's really, really important).|`|pvgwJwxvaa	because she is trying to be dominant over you.  why isnt she spayed yet?|`|FQmZLqMdaa	She can probably smell your hormone change or body odour.  If you do not intend to breed her then get her fixed it will soon sort her out.|`|KxjUim7yaa	It is not sexual, it is dominance issue. Push her off and tell her NO.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	"Mini" rat terrier? Thats a new one.    Let me dumb this down as much as possible:    During sex, the hormones in both males and females are at the top peak. Your dog can smell these hormones, and pick up on the indications. Animals react accordingly to how the brain reacts to the hormone levels.    She is humping you because (a) YOUR hormone levels are through the roof, and (b) HER hormone levels are through the roof.    Have her spayed and crate her when you and your boyfriend decide to have sex.|`|0a07f2e5a084ebc8ae39f790612c5390aa	Its purely dominance she wants you to think shes the boss..

PGkbPBZmaa	Honestly, I highly advise against adopting a degu. They aren't bad pets, but they are definitely not the cuddly kind.  They can be tamed, but in general they are fast and do not like being held. So they aren't really a hands-on kind of pet, like a ferret or other small animal would be.     Ferrets can make great pets but they live a long time and need a lot of attention and training to be the perfect pet. They need large wire cages and special food. Usually if you do not get your ferret young and don't train it, it will bite. They can bite pretty hard and have very sharp teeth!  Also, even when they are "descented" ferrets produce a natural odor that many people don't like.    My favorite small animal is a rat. They should be kept in same-sex pairs, but they make great pets. They are clean, don't smell, and don't bite.  Once yours is tame is will love cuddling with you.  They, like ferrets and degus, need large wire cages.  Rats are very intelligent and can be taught tricks.     Just do research on whatever you are leaning towards!  I reccommend thinking about the following aspects in relation to your choice of pet:    -What is the lifespan of the animal? If it's long, be prepared to being committed for years and years.  -What is the cost of a cage? Gerbils and hamsters cages are a lot cheaper than rats, degus, and ferrets.  -What are your plans for the future?  If you are in highschool for example, and plan to be going to college in the next 4  years, a ferret or degu would not be a good choice, they can live over 20 years. Dorms won't allow them!        Good luck!|`|lhmsAlQuaa	Ferrets are born without 1 emotion and that's fear and Ferrets have possible thumbs and thier very curyus so you might have your hands full on that one   and sorry i dont know what a Degu is? (^^)\/ peace|`|aDeDOmxBaa	Hello i used to study and work in animal care and i have looked after both of these before.    Degus are a bit like a chinchilla and a very large gerbil and have similar requirements. They have claws so watch out for that and are very very strong so will need suitable accomodation. They cannot be kept in a hamster cage they will need something similar to a chinchilla cage or larger. Two is good although be prepared to separate if they mature and become intolerable of eachother. I really cannot stress the size of the accomodation. They will gnaw and chew to get out even if they have a massive room to themselves and they will get through plastic and wood so you need metal!     Ferrets are much the same housing size wise although tend not to chew as much. Both animals can be a bit stinky. Other than space requirements i dont think they will be too expensive to look after.    In terms of handling, degus unless already quite tame, tend not to become as tame as say a hamster. Ferrets generally become tamer than degus for some reason although there is exception to every rule.    Im no specialist so i suggest a good explore on the internet will give you some more ideas.    Hope this helps,    Gem x|`|C7GY9qbGaa	i would recommend a ferret i have one he is 5 i love him to death, they are kinda hyper when they are young but get better as they age. you can cuddle them and play with them they are kinda like having a kitten but they always stay kinda small. they sleep alot so they would be ready to play after school or work. i would really recommend a male my mom has a female and the other one i have been around were mean the males were always friendlier and more cuddly..hope this helps in your decision

Then you apply to vet school (which is very hard to get in) and go to school another 4 years, where you are in class from 8:50-5:30 pretty much M-F trying to learn everything you need to know about being a good vet.    In your 3rd or 4th year, you can take an equine emphasis, but the basics of large and small are taught to everyone.       In undergrad college- you need at least a 3.5 GPA, preferably higher and lots of experience with a vet, working with other people's horses, etc.         I would suggest gaining a lot of animal experience, and if you can't, make sure you get excellent grades (over a 3.9).

Anyway I think he should be fine and immune to it, but i would still call a vet, and see what the vet says about your situation and then do whatever the vet says.|`|ZUOLntgiaa	what do you do? first of all slap yourself in the face for feeding live!! that is exactly the reason reptile shops sell frozen rats..to stop this happening..take him to the vets to be on the safe side depends how bad the bites are..you say he was bitten alot of times?? even in the unlikely event that your snake could not in any way shape or form be turned from live to frozen rats, you should of been watching and ready for an even such as this to grab the rat out..so, take your hand, and slap yourelf again in the face!! o and good luck sorting your mistake out that your snake is paying for
AA10408696	two cats need two litter boxes, they will mostly pee in one and poo in the other,,,  he tears it up because he likes the way the bag and his claws feel, stop putting a bag in the box,|`|EfBMzCjaaa	because hes defiant and wants to pee on the floor and becuz its something that u make him go in there.|`|wxRPKEeYaa	My cat does that, too! LoL =D|`|939307a82ae025e53a21c0a641378b87aa	Because it probably pisses him off.|`|AA11895447	Probably a territorial thing. If you have just the two cats they can use the same litter box, you just have to clean it every single day. You can buy litter specially formulated for multi-cat use. Just get a larger box and that special litter, and see if he stops ripping up the box.

I did this a couple of times with escaped cats. Use a flashlight, because animal eyes (including your cats eyes) will reflect the light back to you. You'll find that you can detect an animal from a block away or more (even under bushes) by the bright reflection of their eyes in the beam of the flashlight.  If you can't see the cat, or can't catch it when you find it, you can set out cat food as bait in a live trap. This method is also very effective. I caught a feral cat this way last fall. She's now my happy little couch potato kitty.  Good luck.
AaXl3vcCaa	they do the best as a pair, i have three, but keep in mind they are aggressive and will fight, try to get them about the same size and know you have to have AT LEAST a 50 gallon tank (i have a 100), but ya they will fight and probably get some wounds but as long as they are not like killing each other its fine|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Oscars do fine by themselves, and unless you have a BIG tank it's better to keep them that way. A 55gal is a minimum, better to go to 75gal. thats just for the Oscar.    A larger tank gives much more options for tankmates, but you will want to be up around 90gal before you try keeping an Adult Oscar AND other fish.    Multiple Oscars can be tricky, it depends on the sex and temperament of the fish. A pair should live happily, two females may tolerate each other, two males may fight over territory.    If you do have the space, a LARGE pleco usually makes a good tankmate.     Ian|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	oscars do fine by themselves. the most important thing to remember is that they get BIG, and they need a BIG tank to accommodate it. for every oscar you have you should have at least 20 gallons of water for it. they also are dirty fish, so make sure you can keep up on tank maintenance. some people feed them feeder goldfish, but you don't have to. goldfish actually have little nutritional value to them and just make your water quality worse. best food for them would be oscar pellets along with brine shrimp and blood worms. oscars can also eat dark greens and zucchini!    also i dont recommend mixing them with other fish because of their aggressive nature.    o, and also make sure your top of your tank if fully covered because they are known to jump out!|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	If you get them both early enough they will get along, for a while. If the tank starts to get crowded the Oscars will get hostile.|`|0FH31TBEaa	either by itself or with a few other fish 5-6 others that way it wont be aggressive to just one.     but if you keep an oscar with anything else you'll deffinatley need a tank more than 100 gallons    possible fish are : silver dollars, jack dempsey,green terrors (oscar should a;ways be larger than these two), plecos, syno catfish, bichirs, large cat fish, severums( can be very pretty, my recommendation, very cheap too)   but again youll need more than 100 gallons for other fish.|`|UaLlyLAaaa	Well, mostly better by themselves or they may be semi-agressive w/ other fish here take a look @ this chart. =)    http://www.petco.com/assets/livefish/fre...    http://www.aquariumlife.net/profiles/sou...|`|at4pnpxlaa	i read on this wed site that they do good with buddies be last time i was at a pet store i saw an oscar fish eating another fish wired.... well thats ur disison  ok ok bro well if u do get da fish i hope u r happy wit dem!!! =)|`|P3w07SsGaa	i have 3 oscars and 3 pacu in a 125 gallon but yes u can keep them singled...but 2 oscars would be better..but its up to u but my friend had on by himself and her tank was to small so she gave it to me ( i use to have 5 oscars but i gave two away, including the one i was given,and thats how i got three now)but he hated me he was agressive and when i tried to feed them he tried attacking me idk y he just did but he was smaller then mine ...close to 9-10 inches and mine are about 11 or 12 (the three i got now) and they are calm and peaceful..but if u put a fish in there they'll attack it but anyhow u'd be ok with one but another oscar or some other large cichlid except the real agressive ones like wolf fish cichlids or peacock bass, or them then ur ok ..even an agressive small cichlid like a convict would be ok with ur oscar

O545aSKWaa	it sounds like you're doing everything your supposed to do:)  Also consider taking your puppy out for a walk. Get her moving, usually that helps getting things going.    She's still pretty young so plan on it taking a little longer, but don't despair your heading in the right direction!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	she is a small breed puppy which means she probably won't be 100% house broken for several more months.  Walk her on a leash instead of simply putting her outside so she knows what you want her to do- be patient.|`|DrvCh24caa	Sorry but you are doing a few things wrong.    You can only use the crate for potty training if you don't crate her during the day. Also 20 mins is WAY to long.     Here is some advice,    Use "get busy" as your keyword instaed of go potty, because that tends to come out too whiny. When you take her outside, when she does pee, as soon as she does, give her a treat. This way she associates that she gets a treat for going busy!    If she doesn't go to the bathroom, no treat, take her back upstairs, put her in the same room as the crate, WITHOUT the crate in it, for no more than 5 minutes. Take her back outside and use the keyword 'get busy' again. If she doesn't do it, repeat the process..    Small dogs do get cold but its no excuse for potty training. Make sure you don't use the pad when you're home, pick it up right away, only put the pee pad down when you're not home because if they have a choice, they're lazy too, they'll stay inside.    Also try taking both dogs out at once, reward oscar for peeing, if she sees he gets rewarded she might follow example. Key with the treats is to make sure you bring them with you outside, if you wait to give her a treat when she's inside, you're reinforcing her coming in as the praise, not peeing outside.    It'll take time but be consistant, Hope this helps!

I used to ride a Clydesdale, and I'll tell you, draft horses are AMAZING to ride.

Do remember, it's a loooong way to the ground.<br>  2. I've found that draft horses are not as sensitive to pressure as most other horses, so a dressage whip may come in handy (I sometimes used one even though I ride Western)<br>  <br>  Have fun!!! :)|`|y7H1V39Jaa	Yes, Shires are big but that doesn't have anything to do with being able to ride them or not, unless you have trouble finding a saddle that fits them.

I'll tell you. Well, everyone thinks that dogs are simply smarter, for what they call "obvious" reasons. Dogs can sit, roll over, play dead, fetch, et cetera, and a cat can't, right? Well, did you ever try? And even if you did, and your cat didn't fetch, does that mean that it can't? Think about this. Robert DeNiro says that "Dogs are emotionally shallow" (Meet the Parents, 1997). This is true. "Cats make you work for their affection" (DeNiro 1997), whereas dogs just accept how you treat them, however degrading it may be, and just keep running back to you. Even if you weren't giving it treats for fetching, rolling over, and the like, it would do them just because it can't handle the prospect of falling out of favour with you. The cat doesn't care, his or her sense of self-worth is not derived from how you think of it. Also, the cat is lazy, which brings us to our next point.    We have established that the dog fetches, whereas the cat doesn't (not that you tried). Though it is safe to assume it wouldn't, how does that mean it can't? Do you really know what's going through that cat's mind? I'll tell you. It's thinking "What if I don't go after the stick? Then my owner will just do it. Why would I, or should I bother when someone else is just going to do it if I don't?". Sounds like a plan to me. Of course, your dog never would have thought of that. Let's move on.    Now we're inside the house. How does the cat behave inside the house? It "works" (if you can call it that) to get what it wants. When your cat sits in front of the fridge, what do you do? That's right, you get up, irregardless of how busy you were, or what you were doing, and you inconvenience yourself to feed it. If the cat sits at the back door (or front door) and looks outside, what do you do? That's right, you get up, irregardless of how busy you were, or what you were doing, and you inconvenience yourself to let it out. Yes, you can train your dog, but your cat, in effect, has trained you. Deny it all you want, but it is the truth. Never thought about it that way, did ya? Now don't ever let me hear you say that dogs are smarter than cats again.|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	have both but dog|`|ErN3pbTeaa	I think Dogs are better.    Cats:  -Do Not listen.  -They own you, and it is hard to build a relationship with them because of how independent they are.   -They are lazy and are for lazy people. Can you jog with a cat!? NO.  -Their urine is HORRID  -They'll claw the heck out of your furniture, drapes, pillows...    Dogs:  -Are Fun, active, and have more personality. Cats sleep ALL day!  -Listen and can be trained to do very intelligent things. Like fetch beers, lead blind people across streets, herd sheep...etc.  -They will love you unconditionally. I prefer friends (animal and human) that don't ignore me and act like they are too good for me. Even if they are emotionally shallow...Isn't that what we want from a pet!? Maybe not a human but a PET.     -Protect their Family  -Go to the bathroom outside  -And all of their bad habits are easily re trainable..Watch the Dog Whisperer people!|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	cats taste better|`|AA12081690	I don't have a pet.|`|e2J4r10Raa	Dog person, but cats can be cool|`|nANyAvzgaa	Cat|`|mpUsNchQaa	dog|`|f19ee1045aef72436e9f25e3d464e467aa	cats :)  they burry their crap.|`|IrGeFFMKaa	Both but it depends i dont like mean dogs and i dont like mean cats.|`|rHRY7oeZaa	Well are you looking for a fun happy playing animal DOG!

BNkQA2pFaa	I don't work in a shelter, but I wanted to comment to Plum. One reason they don't just kill them is because there are actually some people that love them and may adopt them one day. I wonder if you would say the same thing about the many babies and children in orphanages around this world. Do we just need to kill those children instead of letting them be in a place where they may never be adopted.|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	I could never work @ a place like that, I don't understand we waste our money on shelters when it would cost so much less to just kill them, instead of keeping them in a miserable cage, same thing we do to murders & rapist for punishment, think about that|`|r9BXyz9zaa	There's no right answer. And by putting this question up, I think that you're looking for a way out of the pain you're in. Never stop yourself from crying, not even if you'll think you'll be embarrest. What makes you even sadder is when you feel you can't cry.  What you do is take five minutes a day to just "practice your breathing". Take 5 minutes to just ... breathe..... inhale.... exhale... If there's any pent up emotions let them pour out. Want to cry, but you've been holding back? Just .... breathe it out...... in.. out... You'll feel a lot better. Just, take 5 minutes to empty your emotions, it will be better for you and the animal because you can't help an animal if you're holding back from emotions.  I can't tell you it will get any better, nor that it will get easier, all that I can say is that you're a wonderful person from what i know already. You're kind, giving, caring, and you're rescuing animals. So just sit back and look at the big picture, there are so many animals out there, you have to start some where.   When I asked a question here, a wise person gave me this story for advice:    The Starfish Parable:    An old man walking on the beach at dawn noticed a boy picking up a starfish and throwing it into the sea. When asked why, the boy explained that the stranded starfish would die if left to lie in the morning sun. 'But there are millions of starfish on this beach,' said the old man. 'How can your efforts make a difference?' The boy picked up another starfish and placed it in the waves. 'It makes a difference to this one,' he said.    I know that I can't save them all, but the ones I can save mean everything in the world to me.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Go ahead hon cry, it shows you're human and know the value of a life no matter how small.  I have been a foster home for border collie rescue for 5 years now guess you could say I have the happier job, sending the saved ones to their new homes.   As time goes on you will learn how to "put your feelings away" while at work, take them out later and let it go...and know that there is a silent multitude out there that share your grief at end of each and every day|`|OKiMkaxGaa	That's really sad and would be hard for sure. I don't work in a shelter, but I can say one thing: it may be tough, but you will be making a difference in their lives. Just keep your goals in mind and the fact that you are changing lives. You don't have to keep it bottled up, it is hard. But don't forget-where would we be without people like you?    God bless you and thank you, you'll be in my prayers,  Christine|`|4TX26viFaa	It's always been this way. It was worse before they had animal shelters.    I don't know that anyone ever gets used to that stuff. You want to strangle people when they say 'oh she got pregnant again' or 'his fur doesn't match the carpet'.  You'll see the worst things coming in.  Lousy reasons, scared animals.  Injured by boyfriends.      What's worse is the people who do love their animals and can't find a place that accepts pets, who have to leave their pets at the shelter.  They DO care, it tears them apart.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I don't know how shelter workers do it.  I am crying right now.  Just thinking about it.  I have 'walked' the shelter floors to pick dogs to foster.  THAT was hard enough.  At least now I am with a rescue who does that for the foster homes.  It tears me up inside.  People say to me 'you have too many animals, why don't you get rid of some?'  What does that mean?  Drop them at the shelter?  I could not live with myself.    I can't give you any advise, sweetie.  I have nothing I can contribute to help you feel better to help you cope.  I just know if you can do it and stay strong then you have something I do not have.  And, bless you, if you feel like crying go ahead.  You have to let it out.|`|OnDeACeJaa	You know what, I couldn't do what you do. I do some work with animals and I see them in horrible situations. I don't think it gets any easier. I have sat there and listened to the reasons animals are turned in. It makes me so angry I have wanted to scream. Some people are so selfish and don't think animals have feelings which is so untrue. The good thing is you are a worker that cares and is just not there for a paycheck. I have seen scumbag criminals work for the SPCA so they could arrange break ins of valuable fighting pitbulls.  It good to know someone cares and sometimes your compassion is the last thing an animal will know. People always tell me you can't save them all. I always reply no but I can try. As long as I have tried I can live with myself.|`|IgLCInDQaa	I worked at our shelter for 5 months and no it did not get any easier for me. the long term workers at our shelter have become so use to it. That it only takes the most horrifying cases of abuse to get them no show any emotion. I didn't want to become like that. So I quit and now do fostering for them.   I would go in the laundry room a lot just to cry or so I didn't hurt a owner bring their pet in. You will get so sick of the lame accuses they give.   I also found comfort in the time I could spend with the animals knowing that for the time they were with us I made their lives a little better.  but bless your heart and good luck to you|`|Y4pfVX10aa	no it wont get any easier but after awile you learn to deal with it and its okay to cry but dont let in come between your kob and i know i saw a dog that was brought in and it was so skinny and its face was the saddest thing i ever saw i just broke out crying and i know some dogs wont get adopted but hopefully you work at a no kill animal shelter
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Wet tail causes hamsters to become very dehydrated.  This can be fixed though over a couple days and I can help you with that.  If the following steps for getting her drinking and eating over the next 48 hours, talk to your vet.    Wet tail *does* completely go away.  It's stress induced and it's a bacterial infection.  It's the hamster equivalent of getting a really really bad case of the stomach flu (aka the runs) and if it's cured by antibiotics and the cage has been cleaned out, she should be fine :)     If you'd like a food list that gives you good (lots of good!) & bad (and why the bad ones are bad - like too much sodium (celery) or a diuretic (ice burg lettuce)) and other examples, just let me know :)    Here're the steps for rehydrating her, and you may still want to try the baby food for a few days even though she's eating regular food - it'll be easier on her tummy while she's getting better :)    1. Get a baby syringe or eyedropper.    2. Buy some pedialyte.  If you can't find that, grab some honey.    3. Mix the pedialyte 50/50 with water.  If you're using honey, add a tiny bit to the water until it's just sweet to the taste.    4. Drip this slowly into your hamster's mouth.  Don't force it or you could push the liquid into its lungs - very bad.    5. If the hamster responds to this - you'll need to do it every couple hours - you can move on to the next step.    6. Get some pea & ham baby food. It's best because it has 2 proteins, starch and some simple sugars.    7. Mix it with water until it's a thin consistency that you can draw easily into the dropper/syringe.     8. Again, drip this into the hamster's mouth, and don't force it.    The hamster may actually lick the water and/or food mixtures off the syringe/dropper.  This is good.    If the method above doesn't work within 24-48 hours - remember to get her to a vet :)    If you need any more help, I'll be glad to give you a hand, just msg me :)    Daisy|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	Go to the vet as soon as possible. This could be leading to a disease.     Hope that helps.

Breeds like that don't always get along with other animals well    They require LOTS of exercise, so yes they can become destructive and anxious if bored.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Kelpies are not really pets.    They are working dogs and need a lot of activity.    Expecting it to get that on the end of a chain is not realistic.   They need regular long walks and lots of play.    Unless you have the time for exercise and play it might not be the best choice.|`|yLwKWzIUaa	sounds like you've been doing your research, good job :)  i'm 17 and have a passion for dogs and training, props for being a dog person :P  i'd say go for it, but make sure you have the time to excersise your dog/puppy. kelpies are working dogs and need activity. but it sounds like you have the space and the desire to raise a wonderful dog. regardless of the breed you choose to get though, make sure you get him from a reputable breeder, not a pet shop. also, try to register for dog obedience classes, they're sooo much fun for you and your dog. or try agility (great activity for working dogs. well, any dog), even more fun.  good luck :)|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	I can only speak from experience with my Kelpie.  He is the first and only Kelpie I have owned.  I have had Border Collies in the past as well as Belgian Shepherd Groenendaels.  I also have a Belgian Shepherd Malinois at the moment.    My dog, Comet, now 7, has been a really great dog.  He is an intact male yet is still a sociable dog.  He is a dominant dog and if another dog wants to fight I reckon he'd have a go.    Kelpies are a herding breed and many Kelpies will chase cars if they get half a chance.  My own dog will chase 4 wheel drives along the fence (he really loves Landcruisers the best).  For this reason we have to have a secure fence for him and he does not go off lead near a road.    They are a really hardy, tough breed with the added bonus of being low maintenance.  He still sheds his coat but it is usually a major shed twice a year, unlike my Malinois who leaves hair whereever he goes.    Before we got Comet, I mistakenly assumed that the Kelpie's temperament would be very similar to the Border Collies or Groenendaels's temperaments.  They are not - they are a tougher, harder breed - more like a Cattle Dog in nature.      They are very intelligent and highly trainable, but again they will work differently than the Border Collie or Groenendael.  These two breeds are very focused on their handler.  In my experience the Kelpie, while following the handler's commands, will be taking in all around him - the other dogs, instructor, spectators, etc.  I have found this to be challenging after training the other breeds.  Comet doesn't miss a command but his focus is not fully on me.  I put this down to the breed's need to be able to think independently from the handler, if necessary, when working sheep.  Perhaps someone who works Kelpies can shed some light on this.    Comet is a great family pet generally.  He did "herd" the kids when they were younger but this never really worried them as they had grown up with dogs.  When he plays he can get really intense and rough (usually encouraged by the kids) but when told "enough" he backs of and settles down straight away.  Comet also herds the Malinois who is still a puppy.  Luckily for the Malinois he is taller and faster and can eventually get around him.    I'm sure that a Kelpie could treat a soft owner with absolute contempt.  They respond to an owner who is firm but fair.  Kelpies need to be kept active through training, play and exercise, not only physically but mentally.  As for all of the herding breeds - a bored dog is a destructive dog.  That is not to say that this has to happen 24/7, but several hours each day, especially while they are young, is a must.    I would not trust "training" your dog to keep it inside a barbed wire fence, especially if there is any traffic near by.  You can't be out there 24/7 to ensure that the dog is staying inside the fence.  I also don't believe in keeping a dog chained up for long periods.  I know that working Kelpies on properties are chained to kennels unless they are working.  This is for several reasons, to prevent fighting between the dogs and so that when they are released they know that it is time to work.  Still and all, I feel sorry for those dogs when they are chained up.    I do tie the dogs up at times if it is necessary.  Recently we have had alot of workmen around the place, so to keep the dogs safe, especially in case they leave the gate open, we will tie the dogs up for a few hours.  Apart from that they have the run of the property.  We too have 5 acres but only about 1.5 acres are securely fenced so the dogs have the run of that.  We are getting quotes for getting the whole placed securely fenced with 5 foot chain wire - it will be about $15000.00 but the whole 5 acres will be securely fenced and the dogs will have the run of the lot.    I think that chaining dogs up too much can make them aggressive.  I don't know if it is due to boredom, lack of socialisation or fear but it seems to happen regularly.      Honestly, I think that if you can't securely fence all or part of your property then you should reconsider having a Kelpie.
JiUKeyhGaa	well he may be stressed out probably not  ised to his new enviorment yet or maybe ur handling him to much or maybe he is full and eats very little since he is a baby i also maybe ur beardie is a sunburst and they change there color they can range from orange to yellow|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	I think you better check your temps real quick. Be sure the basking spot is 100-105 degrees. If he is a baby he should not be brumating. They are usually around a year old when they do that. Do you have a UVB on him?  You didn't give any real specifics so its hard to answer but check your temperatures like right now.|`|eS8wuYRfaa	It sounds like the temperatures in the tank are too cold.  Make sure he has a basking spot(right under the basking light) of 100-105 degrees Fahrenheit.  He also needs a cooler spot of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.  They do get darker when they are cold and they can't properly digest their food when they are cold..so they won't eat at all.

You may have loved horses but basically all little girls love them, even ones who hate getting dirty. This very well could be a phase, but it's just lasting longer. You're telling us you've only been riding for 5 years? That isn't that long. Personally, I've been playing softball for 8 years and about the 7th year when I was doing everything (school ball, club ball, etc.) it wore me out and I've lost interest. I still love it, and I like playing it seasonal, but not year-round anymore. I don't have as much of a passion as I used to. It took me 7 years of playing for me to loose interest, and you're only on your 5th year!    In this case, I would definitely have a back-up plan. I want to get a career in horses as well. I plan on being an equine vet, equine massage therapist, equine nutritionist, and maybe one day move up to being an equine chiropracter as well. If I have time, I would definitely love to go to school to be a certified farrier as well. Together my salary can be $130,000 excluding the farrier and chiropractor. In some cases it can be more.    From there I want to use my money to open up my own barn and become a trainer/manager there. I don't want a 10 stall barn like yours, I want a big 20 acre one with arenas, three stable blocks (30-50 stalls), a mare motel, hot walkers, circle pens, and much more! I want it to be my business and my life.    Because that isn't always the most reasonable thing, I've planned back-up careers. Sometimes it can be really hard to make it in the horse world! So my other careers are an Animal Welfare Lawyer, Epidemiologist, or a regular humane nutricionist. Then after some savings I could then buy a smaller barn and still live out my dream, just in a smaller version.    You see where I'm going with this? It can be very realistic if you're willing to put all your effort into it and be very educated with horses. But let me tell you, to become an equine chiropracter will take you 8 years of college. Are you 100% into this to go through 8 years of college? Becoming a farrier and trainer it doesn't require a college degree, just for you to take a specified class and become certified.     Just think about it for awhile and research each job and think "Will I want to do this for the rest of my life?". If you can't see yourself doing it, then don't. Look for something horse-related but can be opened up wide. Like becoming an Animal Welfare Lawyer. That job allows you to be a lawyer for animals where you protect their rights. They can earn about $90,000 yearly. And if you get tired of it, then you can become a regular lawyer or use other things with your degree. There's a TON of possibilities. It's something to consider, at the least.    Good luck and keep your dreams in mind!|`|1BJtTl8Baa	This is how alot of us started, I am 40 and I remember acting my dreams out with Breyer Horses!!!!! Look on line at Equestrian programs. I am not sure af the site ,but google and check out Midway College in Kentucky they have some great college oppertunities, you are never too young to start working towards your dream!!!!!!|`|TSc8OE4vaa	You can't really live off of eight boarders without a day job.  One idea is to take field boarders (boarders with no stall) and stall boarders.  You will need more stalls to be profitable and you won't be able to afford the barn without working a day job first.    -You don't need college for any of those things.  My trainer is one of the most experienced horsepeople I know, I'd trust her with anything and she started working at a breeding farm straight out of high school and then started leasing a farm 5 years later, then bought her own farm 3 years after that.  She is 26 right now, has about 30 field boarders and a 10-stall barn and earns a living from that and she breeds very high-quality show ponies and she also trains OTTB's and resells at a high profit.    -don't do farrier school.  If you are only doing your own horses it's not worth the effort, it would be cheaper to just hire your own farrier and a pro farrier would probably be better for the horses.    I recommend doing a "mixed bag" approach- take some stall boarders, some field boarders, and buy/train a few bombproof horses and give lessons to kids on them.  Also buy some young horses and train them.  This will allow you to diversify... that way if one area isn't working out you always have a back-up plan.     It's a lot more beneficial to work at an established barn than to go to school.  You can only learn horses from first-hand experience... yeah someone can tell you how to take care of a colicking horse or how to give a shot but the only way to really learn is by doing.  There are some nice colleges that teach equine nutrition and management, you might want to consider those.  I'm pretty sure Delaware valley is a great school for learning equestrian things.    For the logistics: Eight boarders.  You can't charge more than $500 a month unless your facility is awesome... about $200 of that goes to horse care so that's $300 a month per horse profit.  So that's 2400/month, but then you have to pay mortgage on the farm, around $100/month insurance, then you have to pay for things like upkeep of the stable so that'll leave you about 1000/month to live on.  At that price you might as well work at McDonald's.|`|UndOg7yeaa	you can do anything as long as your dedicated. stay in school and just remember when you feel like quitting that everything is worth while.

It depends what kind you want. Do you want a small or large dog?  Playful or lazy? Needing lots of excercise or none at all?  Go to Animal Planet and you can take a quiz for what animal is best for you.|`|30Gvai4Yaa	I love schnauzers.  They are very smart.  They are fun, loving and active.  They don't shed.(hypoallergenic)  They also come in miniature form, standard form, or there are giant schnauzers too.|`|dnOMFy0Maa	OK i have a black lab mix she is kinda smaller but not really she is bigger then a beagle and smaller then a german Shepard. I have had her for 4 Years i got her when she was 1 she had some problems but with a little bit of training she was great (but with any dog some training is needed) Get a dog that will fit you and your home if you don't live in a very big home get a dog that needs less excises and a small dog maybe to not a big dog that needs walks an taken out to be playen with every day|`|SqWJCZyeaa	It depends. If you want a good Family dog that has young children, avoid small dog breeds and German Shepards. If you live by your self in a small house or apartment, you should get a smaller breed like a yorkie or maltese or pug or some small breed like that. If you are living with a big family I highly suggest a Labrador retriever. They're great dogs.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Depends on your wishes:    if you want a fun loving medium sized dog where you don't mind shedding and you have a lot of time to spend and train them- think of a collie. (perferably a border collie)    If you want a sweet small one that you can play with, one that BARLEY sheds and is hypoalergenic- think of a yorkie.    If you want a good, nice guard dog who is good with kids and is good inside and outside- think of a mastiff or great dane.    Or if you just want the overall sweet dog, who loves, and can be calm or fun, who sheds some, and is overall nice- consider a shiba inu.      OR you can just be that kind of great person who adopts a dog in need from a local pound or shelter. And not a store.        (Good luck)|`|0jmVA50Jaa	In America, the American Bulldog.
qGy9fR7xaa	Licking can mean two things...  It's often a sign of affection, which is very common, or maybe you your hands smelt of something, food or scented soap or just salty. Maybe this is why you thought they were about to bite you.  Don't worry, i'm sure they like you, if not they'll grow to. I mean, they're only babies so they're probably just curious.  Good luck!! :)   |`|yAlyAt8Zaa	Ya, they do love you.  Licking is the sign that shows this.  They probably got scarred. Maybe you did a sudden movement(they get scared from this almost every time).    But in know, they love you. You have nothing to worry about|`|s80ED7Ygaa	They love you! Don't worry :D|`|va8xvhthaa	Did you do something that made them not trust you? They might've been frightened of something, or were angry. Play with them every day from now on, and feed them veggies from your hand. Either ways, I'm sure that they still love you. If it's because their teeth are too long, get them a few chew sticks! Good luck!|`|hqlnUXIraa	They love you! They may have done it by accident because their teeth are long and they didn't mean it. Their teeth may be too long so I would give a new stick or you can try a mineral chew too.|`|OtjXWzOZaa	rats need lots of socialization and if you havent been playing with then very much they get scared of humans and stuff anyway just try to have them out of their cage every day.

According to the Dog Fanciers' Magazine, the Rottweiler supposedly has the hardest bite at 2,400 PSI. However, regardless of the "proof" you may have, I believe that there is absolutely no possible way to test this accurately. Every dog is an individual. One specimen of the breed may have a weak nip while the other can tear you apart. In the test, who says the dog was biting its hardest? How large was the sample? How was the test done? How accurate and reliable was it?    2.) German Shepherd, although they aren't generally known as "war dogs."    3.) English Mastiff, if by "biggest" you mean overall mass. The Irish Wolfhound is typically the tallest, followed by the Great Dane. (Irish Wolfhounds are generally taller, but I believe the "tallest dog" title goes to one specific Great Dane.)    4.) Golden Retriever? That's just from one article I've read, though, I can guarantee that plenty of owners use webcams to check in on their pets. I've personally known several.    5.) Dachshund.    6.)

D178335Paa	Honestly an aqua nursery is better. When the mom had babies is sucks them out into a new tank where the mom cant eat them. Btw Mollies are usually pregnant because they don't separate the fish at stores. Anyways, You can look the aqua nursery up online or find it at a local pet store. Good Luck!!|`|nQ800xxTaa	go on the internet i don't think my anwser would be very helpfull|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I just bought a tank divider from Petsmart this afternoon, and I am very happy with it.|`|hF4G3P1Maa	I would get the net, as it will be easier, in my opinion!|`|xbyQAU4haa	The same thing happened to me.

hQIqEnTEaa	In regards to him being slow try to change his diet to perk him up a bit. I feed whole oats to my thoroughbred and they don't make him fizzy but they do give him plenty of energy so that he is willing and forward. Make sure his diet is balanced and that he has enough grains for the amount of work he does.     I'm going to go against the opinion here and say that if you've tried everything you can think of to make him go faster (check him for arthritis or injuries, up his feed, use a crop/spurs, etc), then YES, SELL HIM.     If you have a horse that is not suitable for what you want to do then change to a horse more suited. I personally would not consider buying a horse that is too slow as I don't enjoy always having to nag at him and carry a whip, nor would he be suitable for the type of work I do. Perhaps he would be better suited to a beginner rider as he has a nice slow gait and careful jump. It's quite simple - if you want to compete in showjumping/eventing you need a horse that is fast - he's a lovely horse but if he's not appropriate for what you want him for you should change horses.|`|FWlSFpByaa	Ok your right he is a bit on the slow side but he has great confirmation, do not sell him you will regret it. There really isn't a specific excersise made but the thing that worked for me is trail rides. Once he gets into a canter you HAVE to push him harder and harder till you get the speed you want. It worked for my QH gelding and he has alot shorter legs then ur TB does.    When i say push him, i mean make him go all the way he can, i didn't have to kick my horse i just rubbed my legs against his sides as we were going and kept sayin C'mon boy C'mon and we did it!!!|`|AA12048299	Your horse is a hunter, and a packer at that. What are you looking for, specifically, as the end result to 'collection and faster'? Do you want to make him a jumper? If so, you have a long way to go as a rider, first.    Please talk with your trainer about your specific goals, and not take any 'training' advice from strangers here on YA. You have a very sweet horse and I'd hate to see him ruined by his rider possibly misinterperating advice given here.     You look like you have a wonderful relationship with him. The picture you present is very nice, and I suggest you continue in the hunter disciplines, where less collection and less speed is perfectly acceptable.|`|vow5ULxTaa	you move your hands and rock them to much.  YOu keep your body in time with your horse but your arms move independently    the canter looks terribly uncomfortable you don't move Very well with the horse almost like when he takes a step you get jerked out of the saddle.      pick your hands up over the jumps you rest them on the horses neck.  The most common reason for doing this is because you are not balanced well or feel unsure over the jump.    your feet point out,  you should lean on the outer most part of your foot and it should point your toes straight and wrap your knees around the horse    your arms are straight they need to be bent at a 90 degree angle.      sit Straight your back needs to be Straight with your hip and heel.    quit pumping your arms at the canter    your butt should not be moving so much at the canter(Little movement as possible is key)    also more incoragment and looser reins will alow for a faster canter.  don't give up on your horse so easily.  some horses are jsut naturally lazy and a slow extended lope like canter is easier for them.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	You'd sell him for being a little on the slow side?  He's really not even that slow!     Yes, I know you don't want to hear it, by try carrying a dressage whip. This is what I do with my TB- If he's being lazy I will grab a whip, and let him know that I have one by gently rubbing him with it. When he knows that I have it, he tends to listen to my leg more. If needed, give him a little tap if he tries something such as attempting to break to a trot from canter.    Honestly, your horse really doesn't seem that slow; he may be a little slow for jumpers, but most horses tend to get excited at shows and while doing courses.    Yeah, you could work on making him be on the bit but it just takes practice. I'll leave that to your trainer to explain how to teach your horse that, as different people do have different methods of this. If you'd still want advice on that feel free to email me on here.    Hope this helps and good luck! :]|`|5eNGp8TRaa	Erhm, yes they did, and they gave really good advice. Maybe you should look at your riding? All they are trying to do is help, and sometimes the right answer is not always fun to swallow. Collection WILL help. Trust me. You deleted your last question when you didn't want to hear my advice, so I won't give you any this time. You know my opinion. We aren't going to sugar coat it, nor or we being mean. We're just trying to help.    ETA:  Really now? Can you tell me why pumping at the canter is helpful? As you know, I event too, and if it's beneficial, by all means explain it to me. Who is your trainer?    I have been where you are now, and it took me a while to figure out sometimes the rider's the problem. Fix yourself and everything will come together.  Again, I'm not attacking you. Just saying- fixing your faults will make it soooo much easier in the long run.    ETA II:  Please do. I didn't know Anees trained/ gave lessons.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	I wouldn't sell him.  He has good confirmation and when you trotted him over the poles, he had some nice extension.  Lots of possibilities.    You don't say how long you have had him or how long he was off the track and retrained.  He could use a little more collection and impulsion, but he is solid.  In some of the video, you can see he gains confidence and moves out nice.    He may have gone dead to your leg from all the encouragement he has required or should I say he may have turned his brain off to your leg (had one like yours).  You may want to try some gentle spurs (provide a little stronger encouragement less often) and take up the reins just a little and drive him into the bit a little more.|`|6DCQsdyuaa	ok first of all you MUST sit up more and put your shoulders far back. When you are cantering, your back it "doing the wave" you need better posture and keep your back straighter with still keeping you lower back and hips loose. Lean back more, put your hands up more keep your heels down, and when you edit a video so much its hard to tell anything. NEVER SELL YOU HORSE!! He is fine if anything, he is too fast. he has nice long strides|`|fydy8Zjpaa	have you ever considered bumper spurrs? Just to try to encourage a little more movement. Spurrs are only cruel if you make them cruel...anyways, to get him more on the bit you need to start be def. shortening your reins. You want the horse to give to the pressure of the bit and bring his head back on the bit. Then as you use A LOT of leg you can get him to get off his forehand and become collected..here is a link...    http://www.ridingart.com/balance.htm  this may help you understand it more. You have a very beautiful horse btw..is he a tb?|`|VaZqNLbcaa	i think he is fine. he moves nicely and you ride him well. i wouldn't change too much on him, just keep your heels on him and keep him moving forawrd. hes a great mover, and you should be proud of him.   you would really sell him just b/c he doesn't move faster? wow.|`|sfCBFmGEaa	try to use rthym or speed beads. they will calm a nervous horse and if they have bells, they seem to run faster. you can find these in eques. on e-bay.|`|EetfwNE9aa	go to your local feed store or tack shop and see what "speed and agility" supplement they recommend. but if you go for  holistic supplement make sure you check with your vet.|`|an1L8njXaa	At the moment you dont need faster, what you need is rounder with more impulsion. only when you have rounder and good impulsion can you work on collecting and extending in order to go faster and use less strides etc.    To get the horse rounder you realy need to get him off his forehand, you need to encourage him to realy step under with his inside hind leg and push from there. he needs to round his back and take up a contact along the reins.  Lots and lots of transitons will help, you will need to ensure however that he goes forward from your first aid, this means giving him the first aid and if he doesnt go forward asking him again and backing it up with a crop. Unless you get him going and thinking forward then youve lost already.    Also you need to get lots of lessons to improve your understanding. Faster does not always mean better and faster XC can lead to some horrific rotational falls, ive been there done that, got the injuries to prove it.you need cool calm and collected over jumps and then to blast between the jumps.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	he is a little slow, but it's nothing bad enough to sell him.  work on keep your hands up and even. a technique that i like to use is have the rider hold their crop horizontally in both their hands so that they can see if their hands are strait. stay back, because you're kind of leaning forward when you trot and canter (and pumping with your body and arms). you're probably pumping because you want your horse to go faster; instead of trying to convince him with your seat, keep your leg on. give him a squeeze every stride, and a occasional kick. your jump position looks pretty good, just don't get too far in the saddle. you're good for now, but when you start jumping higher you might get a bad habit.  hope i helped!|`|3O2SfwIBaa	to get a horse on the bit you need to use your seat bones and bum muscles. you push the horse into your hand with your bum. this is how you should ask the horse to move off and go faster. also half halts will help, the horse focus and know that something is expected of it. to collect a horse you use your heels. try it one day when it's just you. get the horse going by just squeezing your bum and releasing. then once he's going put your heels on him gently at first and increase if no response. your horse should hunch up a bit a collect. then you just need to refine the aids and build his muscle for collection. GOOD LUCK|`|4AfRTzRmaa	Your good!! Just watch your diaganol and canter leads. thats all i have :)|`|0FnVKSO5aa	Hey   well i wouldn't sell your horse if he is being on the slow side.   You seriously will regret it! and my arab used to be SOO SLOW and then one day she just got all this energy and was super fast! =/  Now i can't slow her down. anyway i'm BabyKluvsYA in youtube and my horse is on the bit ( I'm pretty sure she is ) but not in all of my vids.  sorry i didn't give you much advice i just wanted to point that out :)
AQsiugSpaa	Hi Amanda,<br>  <br>  We used to have a real problem with that, no matter what kind of garbage can we used. Since one of our cats is able to open cabinets, putting the garbage can in the cabinet under the sink didn't work either.<br>  <br>  What we ended up doing was to purchase a trash compactor, which is portable, so we can move it, should the need arise. It fits right in next to a countertop, and of course, the cats cannot get into it.<br>  <br>  We don't use compactor bags which are costly, so use regular trash bags with drawstrings, and end up using far fewer of them during the week.<br>  <br>  Solution was GREAT.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Nope<br>  <br>  I think she did get into everything when she was a kitten though.<br>  <br>  Just get a heavy trash can with a lid to put the garbage bags in...problem solved!|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	yes, and my doggie sometimes.........|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I have a couple of kitties who used to but I got a  heavy stainless steel can with a lid so they can't tip it over.  About the only I tried that works is putting everything like that in a cupboard.  It's just too stressful to run them away from things all the time and I don't like spraying them with water.  I just make everything as cat friendly and cat proof as I can (down to installing baby locks on the cabinets with the "goodies" in them).<br>  <br>  For a quick fix, put the trash can in a closet or the laundry room and close the door.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	My cats do this too. You should get a garbage can that has a lid. Mine has one of those things on the bottom that you push with your foot and the lid pops open.  That will keep them out.  <br>  <br>  Try putting your other bags in the laundry room or outside until the garbage truck picks them up. Also, keep your paper towels in the cabinet or on top of the fridge (unless she jumps up there too...mine does).  <br>  <br>  Other than that, you can't reason with cats, so you just have to work around them. Mine also broke all my wine glasses on my kitchen hutch.  But I love them anyway!!|`|IuYekkPVaa	Both my cats are ex-feral kittens and the male has never out grown his bin-raiding habits.

She was a stray kitty and I think she fed herself and any kittens she had by digging through the trash so sometimes that old way of thinking kicks in and she gets in there.  She also trained her kitten and her adopted kitten to get into it.  <br>  So now we keep the lid on it all the time and sometimes weigh the lid down with something heavy (only necessary if there is actually something in there they want). That seems to have solved the problem.<br>  <br>  My bigger issue is that one kitten (11 months, barely a kitten any more) shreds my toilet paper.

Rx7wv4JLaa	Yes...Dogs have heat cycles to mate.      This article talks about a female dogs reproduction cycle and about false pregnancy, just ignore the parts about false pregnancy.     http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...|`|3giaPYe8aa	Your never-wrong-boyfriend is correct.  You do know that some b*ches have a "silent season", meaning that you might not even know that she is in season because she isn't displaying all the normal signs.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	With dogs yes.  With cats no.|`|oGVWdnHraa	Yes b!!tches have to be in heat to be able to concieve as this is the only time when eggs are released from the ovaries. You should consider getting both of your dogs spayed and neutered if you have no intention of showing your dogs and doing all the necessary health and temprement tests to produce healthy pups.    http://www.petfinder.com|`|4TX26viFaa	Yes, the egg is released and travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus which is where it gets impregnated by the sperm. If it's not there, it can't get fertilized, and there is no puppy.    While sperm CAN travel up the tubes on rare occasions, if the eggs are not released, they are not ready to be impregnated. Sort of like unripe apples on a tree, they don't fall down if they're not ripe.|`|UmhWxs1laa	If they "went at it" then she is in heat, you just didn't know it.  Some dogs keep themselves very clean. Others have a "silent heat" and you can't tell.     It is very true girl dogs must be in heat to get pregnant -- they do not ovulate any other time.  The best indicator of the girl being in heat?  Interest from a boy!  Their noses are way better than our powers of observation.    Early in pregnancy, you can spay.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Yes is the short answer. Get one of them fixed if U R not going to breed them later. if U R going to breed them later U need t be more careful about their ages and cycles. The female will go into heat anywhere from between 7 -12 months, and when she does U need to protect her in a crate or kennel. U should have studied up on this before U brought home 2 dogs. Having 2 dogs at the same time is fun, but also a big responsibility. Most female dogs come into heat twice a year, and U should always write it down so U don't forget when it's time to watch for the signs.

Some female dogs go through what is known as a 'silent heat', where they exhibit no outward signs, and some bleed very little and clean themselves well so that you do not notice any bleeding.  Females that are not in heat do not allow a male to breed.  Yes, they do need to be in heat to get pregnant, but your dog IS in heat and so, likely pregnant.|`|xBixbBxoaa	yews your boyfiend is right|`|3UtPeK1caa	Don't Delay Neuter and Spay Irresponsible dog owner.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Your kitty needs a check up at the vet.  He probably does have a hairball issue and it sounds like he may be eating too fast sometimes. The peeing issue is indicative of a urinary tract issue so having the vet check him out is important.<br>  <br>  The hairballs can be controlled by daily grooming and by giving him hairball remedy.  For eating too fast , place a couple of golf balls in his food dish to slow him down a bit.<br>  <br>  Even neutered cats can be guilty of territorial/stress-related  marking.  If that's the case, try a Feliway diffuser.  It releases calming pheromones into the air and calms anxiety which can cause cats to urinate inappropriately. Get his health cleared first though.|`|72895a389b784432eea922187fc22a83aa	As this is new and not usual behaviour for your cat, I would strongly suggest you do see a vet.  Besides medication for anything that may be wrong, they can give lots of advice on feeding and behavioural problems.<br>  <br>  It would be well worth the fee to keep your little friend in tip top form and you pair loving each other.<br>  <br>  Best wishes in your kitty's recovery.<br>  <br>  Lisa

Xa9esMTEaa	An obedience correction is anything that's appropriate (aka no drop kicks or karate chops) that redirects a dog's attention back to you and/or tells a dog that he MUST obey you even if he doesn't feel like it, even if there's something more interesting going on. These are usually leash corrections or e-collar corrections but even a tap on the shoulder and a "Hey" or "No" is a correction. If a dog knows the meaning of "No", no becomes a correction itself. A dog can ONLY be given an obedience correction if it knows what you asked of it and refused to obey on it's own accord: Example: You tell your dog to sit, you know for a fact the dog knows what sit means but he sees another dog and decides to ignore your command, you correct him, give the command to sit again and he sits while focusing back on you. Another type of correction, a deterrent correction, is given when a dog doesn't know that what he's doing is wrong but you correct him to show him it's wrong. You give these corrections when you catch your dog digging in the yard, getting into the trash, or chewing on the furniture. A dog doesn't inherently know these behaviors are wrong and the only way we can explain that is through immediate "deterring" corrections. The 3rd type of correction is a correction used to build drive and is used by protection sport trainers, PSD trainers, and knowlegeable advanced obedience trainers (including those who work with gun dogs and catch dogs). These correction build drive and can take a dog to the next level of intensity via frustration....anyway this is a list of what I call corrections, the 3 different kinds, and what they're used for.|`|s76aC4G8aa	I correct by saying AH AH.  No goes ignored so if my dog is doing something I don't like I say AH AH, and that usually gets her attention.  When walking if she pulls I tug the leash to the side and sometimes I use a foot pop on her butt to snap her out of whatever she's focusing on and not paying attention to me, it's not a kick it's just a touch similar to what Cesar Milan does to "refocus" a dogs attention.  I have always used postive reinforcment training because Weims don't respond well to "harsh" training methods AT ALL.|`|c7QJ0ONYaa	A correction is anything from a word/sound to a zap from an Electric collar.    A correction is simply any way you choose to let your dog know that it needs to do what you are asking of it.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	A correction, to me, is something you do that hopefully makes the dog realize that behavior is not going to produce a reward, so try something else.  A correction, when properly given, should make the dog eager to try many other things.  At least that's my favorite type of correction.  I hate the corrections that physically hurt the dog, make them afraid to try more behaviors, or nervous to be taught something new.  Even worse, it makes them hesitate to be creative, to try out a new behavior that could get a harsh reaction from their owners.      The corrections I tend to use the most is to tell my dog he will be getting "no reward' for that behavior.      I consider leash (yanking, choking, helicoptering), pinching, pushing, hitting, etc, as a human attack... not a correction -because that's how the dogs I've worked with reacted to it as: my human attacks me when I do something wrong, I better do right.-  The communication usually isn't as high as it can be.  And the dog doesn't understand what the correct behavior IS -most of the time.  If the dog did, the correction shouldn't be anything more than telling the dog what they should be doing.-  However, I'm very aware that some people see that as a correction.  I just don't.    Add:  Just to clarify, I did not say "no treat" I said "no reward."  A reward means anything the dog will work for.  This includes vocal praise, scritches, a game, a toy, being allowed to play with other dogs, being able to meet a new person, and, usually only while training a new behavior or when nothing else is available, a small (pea-sized) treat.  My dogs rarely if ever get a treat after they know a behavior and will perform it consistently.      Since telling my dog "cold" or "eh" or something else that means "no reward, try something else" actually communicates to the dog that the behavior is incorrect, and begins to direct them to the correct behavior... it IS a correction.  Just like a "click" can be a reward marker, the words I use are the "no reward" marker, and it's used as a correction.    My PUNISHMENTS tend to be things like removing attention, removing the toy, removing the reward, etc.  But that's not a correction.  That's a punishment.      I put in other edits to try and explain myself better, marked with -word- so that they're discernible.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	For me, a correction is a way to communicate to your dog that they have done something wrong.      Like Patient Paws said, there are different levels of correction.  However, I would consider the lightest correction to be withholding a reward and redirection, and the highest to be something worse than a simple leash jerk.      The levels of acceptable correction, however, are a different story.  The issue with correction is that the word has gained a negative connotation, especially among "positive only" enthusiasts, many of whom do not realize they are correcting their dog by not giving them a treat or by issuing a verbal "ah ah".      Personally, I am not a big fan of harsher corrections because I don't know how to properly use them.  Since I haven't had a need to, I only use the verbal "ah ah" or redirecting, as well as withholding a reward.  I personally have a dog that is very easily frustrated, and corrections make her worse.  However, I co-own a dog who is so hard headed that you could probably knee him in the ribs and he would still be bouncing all over you.      I'm going off on a tangent already, but the point is that a correction is anything to tell a dog that you do not appreciate what they are doing (or that they are supposed to be doing something else).|`|C1eHfhrHaa	there are all different types- it can be a sharp "no" or a tug on the leash, a shock from a collar or an alpha roll.  they are all used by various people with some degree of success.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	I wouldn't use any way that is harmfull or "mean" to the dog for one major reason. FEAR doesn't make a well trained dog...well it might, but not a happy one.    I perfer the sudden loud noise when it does somthing bad    put it in a enclosed area for a few seconds when it does somthing bad    simple spices on the places where it chews on    methods.  Always make sure your dog loves you, and reward and praise as much as you dicipline|`|AA11026827	I typically use a sharp vocal UH!, and/or NO, and that works well.  My dog now will know it's a correction if I even go ahh (crescendoing the longer it goes).  I typically also use a light tap on the bridge of the muzzle.  Regardless of what people will think of me, it works, and it doesn't hurt the dog.  It gets their attention and redirects it if nothing else is doing the trick.    My dog is CGC and TDI certified, and I trained him using a choke chain.  He never did pull on the leash, and still doesn't, but it puts him into a better mindset, and he walks perfectly now, on or off leash.    I am okay with some positive reinforcement, but I disagree with the people who say that "not giving a treat is the correction".  A dog should NOT be given a treat for every good thing it does.  Let alone, simple psychology tests were done.  If a dog is given treats every time it performs an action, if you take away the treats, then in a very short time the dog will no longer do it.  If a dog is never given treats as a reward, it makes no difference to them whether you have a treat or not, and they will continue to do the tricks.  If you use the treats intermittently and randomly, that's the best.  They never know when a treat is coming, and so continue to perform no matter if a treat is there or not.  Surprisingly many people that do "positive reinforcement" don't understand this simple matter in psychology, and they begin to teach the dog wrong.    It's a lot of gray area, but I trust scientific findings and research projects.  I give intermittent treats, and disagree with those who want to treat every little action.  For initial training, or training of, say, abused shelter dogs, then yes more treats are better.  However, once they understand what you want, the treats NEED to be weaned off and only used intermittently.|`|AA10029366	A signal to communicate to the dog that their current behavior is not correct. I guess the clicker-trainers out there would consider it the opposite of a "click". :)    It could be a verbal correction (in my house, "Ack!" or "Ehh!"), a collar correction (pop with the lead), or a stim from an e-collar.    The point is that it is quick, fair, and timed to show the dog that what they are doing *at that moment* is not acceptable.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	My definition of corrections would be the obvious: Alerting a dog to something done incorrectly or improperly.     In training, there are levels of correction, each should be used correctly. For example, a level one correction is a verbal correction, and a level 10 is the literal jerk of the leash-- which lifts the dog off of its feet. Level five can be anything from an ear flick to a light pinch.     In my work, the type and level of correction always depends on the individual dog. A dog which doesn't respond well to verbal commands (der) won't respond to a verbal correction.     Most dogs in my field require physical corrections. Things like neck tweaks, tail swats, ear flicks, and on VERY rare occasions, lead jerks.     The worst correction I've ever seen a trainer use would have to be the 'whip'. For a dog that was pulling its owner, he advised to use the lead as a whip and to slap the dog with it as it was pulling. To put it into a mental image, imagine a pulling dog where the leash is tight, and to 'whip' the lead towards the dog in order to hit the ribs and the back of the animal all at once---- it worked, but from that point forward the dog walked as close to the ground and as far away from the owner as possible.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	To me a correction is something that is used to tell the dog that they have done something wrong.     There are two types a verbal or a physical correction.     I use verbal. The only type of physical correction i use is negative punishment which for this I use ignoring.     I also beleive you can never just use a correction you need to use something to tell them that they have done something right as well.     And for things like barking collars or pinch collars unless it is necessary I do not use these types of corrections(for example a dog who refusing to learn the come command, I'd rather use a shock fence then see the dog get hit by a car). Its just my opinion.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	I try not to encourage my clients to give their dogs harsh or unnecessary corrections. A simple "eh eh" or "no" should be sufficient. My biggest correction would be withholding some of value, whether this be the toy, treat, or simply myself.    Most of my border collies are toy motivated. When (and if) they act out, I simply withhold their favorite toy. My golden is food motivated, so I will remove the treats during training until she cooperates. My mutt is very praise motivated, so to get his attention when I mean business I simply ignore him. He hate this. You would seriously think I have just shot his best friend when you see his reaction to this.    My methods are positive and require the dog to think for themselves. I will never recommend a prong, choke, shock/E collar. I will never recommend hitting or yelling at a dog. This includes "bopping" them or flicking them on the nose/ear, smacking their backside, etc. There is no reason, and I mean NO reason, a person should ever hit/jerk/kick/scream/yell or lay a hand on their dog. Ever. There is no reason for it. There is always another way to get your point across to your dog.     Trainers who will recommend these sort of corrections make my skin crawl and makes me sad for any dogs enduring this sort of training. Alpha rolls, jerking of the leash, prong collars, and any other sort of """training""" (and I use that word loosely) is old school and outdated. Not to mention completely unnecessary and in some cases, unacceptable.     Harsh corrections can work, but your dog will learn to fear you and in the long term it will create longer more complex problems.     For example, a lady brought her German Shepherd to me who had been trained by one of the "top" dog trainers in our city (hah..). This dog was nervous, timid, anxious, stressed out, and would lash out in fear. The dog was never like this before she took him to this company who recommend the E collar. You could say his name and he would literally pee on himself.    A few months later (yes months, it takes a lot of time and persistence to undo someone else work), he was an almost different dog. He would still flinch at the sound of his name (they taught her to get his attention by saying his name and shocking him apparently), but he was starting to be his old self again.    I hate when people do harsh training and corrections on their dogs. It may work for short term, but in the long run it can create worse (and life threatening) problems for the owner and dog.    My training is positive reinforcement based using clickers, markers, tons of praise, food/toys, and love!    Boo negative.    Yay positive!    =)|`|yLwKWzIUaa	whether the correction is a sharp "no," a snap of the collar, or a poke to divert the dog's attention (always followed by praise/treats!), what makes a correction is the energy behind it. if you correct a dog while feeling mad, anxious or fearful, the correction either means nothing to the dog, or confuses or scares him. calm assertive energy and consistancy is the key.|`|np6W9hnsaa	I pick positive reinforcement over  physical correction type correction training. To let the dog no they did something bad I say "ouch" or "ehh" and turn my back on them or put them in a bathroom or isolated space. When they are calmed down and there's silence for three seconds you let them back or turn to them again.   Dogs hate being ignored so if they're being ignored they don't like that, and that's a worse punishment they a slap or shock for them.   then you start over. For some dogs it may take a lot of repetition for them to understand, but it's worth it for they will understand eventually.   Patience is key.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    No dog is born with good manners. Pooping on the carpet, leaping enthusiastically onto guests, pulling so hard he practically yanks your arm out of the socket when on walks--that's all perfectly acceptable in the canine world.

It was her choice to do it, her boyfriend did'nt force her to do it and i think if she did'nt want to she would say no and that would be the end of it.She obviously loves the wolves to be willing to do what she did and good on her.<br>  They are trying to get the wolf numbers up so that in the future some can be released into the wild where they belong.

AA12205365	I guess it depends on what you mean by a bone.        With real bones as long as there isn't a lot of meat on it.  (You do want a little meat, connective tissue, and the like for flavor.)  The calories of a bone isn't much as they really shouldn't be eating the bone itself. A bone once and a while helps clean their teeth. The issue with real bones is the wear on the teeth.  A dog constantly chewing on bones is going to wear down it's teeth.  So ever other month or 3 it's fine to get a bone at the butchers.  I tend to let the dog chew a bone for a while then wrap it up and put it in the freezer.     The manufactured bones vary a lot, and they should provide calorie information on the packaging, or the company's web site.  Ideally you should be around when he is chewing a bone, and take loose pieces.  Raw hide bones should be chew only when hard then taken away, and allowed to harden.  Thus most of the "bone" never get eaten.|`|XEbe4Votaa	Assuming you are talking about raw bones (which are good for dogs) 10 - 15% of the diet is about right.  A dog who gets too much bone will usually end up with hard chalky stool.  Enough bone is good, but stool that's TOO chalky can be a bad thing.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Depends on the type of bones you mean. Milk bone do have a lot of calories about as much as half of cup. It would depend on the size of dog as to how many. Small/med I would say 1,2 max - med/Lg 2,3 - giant 4.    Raw meat bones are good for dog & great for teeth. It would also depend on the dog & the diet you are feeding. I would guess a couple a week would enough but w/o more info I can't say.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Are you talking about raw animal bones or bone shaped biscuits??    Assuming that you mean animal bones then yes they do have calories and when fed raw contain many essential vitamins and minerals.  It is important to remember that these need to be included in the daily food tally to avoid overfeeding.    Too much bone (especially bare ones without meat) can cause constipation and even impactions so don't feed more than 10-15% of the total diet in bones.    When a rawfeeder talks about feeding bone they mean meaty joints that happen to contain some bone rather than a big shin or knuckle bone.  The majority of your dog's diet should be meat and other muscle (heart, tongue etc) - 2/3 to 3/4 - and the rest a combination of meaty bones and organs.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Do you mean real raw bones or fake rawhide bones?     Real raw meaty bones are good for you dog. Stick with meat cuts that have a good amount of meat on them like chicken quarters or turkey drumsticks.     Rawhides are bad for dogs.

The post office will not let you ship ANY liquids without some kind of certification.     UPS Ground in the same state is usually Guaranteed next day delivery and for a small box it should only cost around 10 bucks.   Just ask UPS when will it get there if you choose Ground shipping.

BUT a few other things to know is.  1. do not trust a petshop to sell you a real baby budgie as they often sell adults and call them babies. You need to learn the difference between a baby budgie ( babies are tameable ) and an adult.  Here  http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/faqs...      2. Never choose the fluffy ones in the budgie cage at the petshop....the fluffy ones sitting all alone ...the ones you think are lonely or sad are the sick ones. If there are any sick looking ones in the cage at the petshop do NOT buy any bird from that cage at the petshop...go to another petshop or a breeder.   Read this ....http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/faqs...  and here  http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/faqs...    3. Cages.... petshops most often advise badly about the correct kind of cage for your new budgie. They will most likely sell you the ones that don't sell well and ones they want to get rid of.  Here is a cage article I wrote that will help you to know before you go to the petshop and get talked into the wrong cage or a package deal.  Article.....http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/faqs...    4. Tips on training.......  http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/faqs...    5. Petshops just about always get the sex of a baby budgie wrong. Don't listen to anyone that says blue for boys and pink for girls re the colour of their cere ( nostril area above the beak ) as that only applies to older budgies and ones of a certain type. In baby budgies....  any cere that is purply pink is a BOY budgie and  any cere that has white even if it has pale blue with the white...is a GIRL budgie.   Here is an article on ceres. http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/inde...    6. If they wing clip the budgie, make sure BOTH WINGS are clipped not just one.    7. Never let them convince you budgies needs nests or something to "sleep in"  ...they dont.     8. If they try and tell you two budgies is better then it wont work out if you want to tame a budgie. One is better for a tamed budgie.       Hope this helps....better to have all the information before you go shopping for your new friend.|`|zRXkkh0Maa	HI 5!    My birthday is also on the 5th. I', 14 this year (:    YOu will need a cage with a swing and mirror. YOu have to buy a pair so at least they have accompany and you have to change the millet and water everyday.    The best is to feed a chick by yourself so trust will be built. They leave the nest box when they are 6 weeks old. They would reject the milk themselves (You will have to by a special kind of powder).     To make a temporary nest box for them, use a box and put newspaper shreds inside. Change it after they have eaten or dirtied it. They have to be fed every two hours.    You can play with them in many ways, just make sure it is not dangerous. I play with my budgies catching and peek-a-boo, which they enjoy. Sometimes i chase them around the house while they are talking happily, yea, they talk.    Do not feed them:    Avacado  Papaya  Too much mango|`|cWhfAU8Raa	They need small food, fresh water, Toys a cage and love and all u really have to do is change food and water every day and play with them and occasionally clean their cage|`|xR5mCcD8aa	I once had a parakeet myself.If you can I would give it lots of attention or he could get lonely I would also get a cage that is suitable for his size.I would put a mirror in it so that he wouldn't get too lonely. Concerning his food i would get him fresh seed. You could also get him the gourmet diet.For treats you can give them fruits like oranges and apples. I used to give mine crackers and millet for treats.They need fresh water daily.To help them digest properly and to absorb the toxins i would get him grit.(a gravel blend with crushed oyster shells).They also need cuttle bone to build healthy strong bones.

I enjoyed reading what real people have to say about their feathered babies.      GOOD LUCK!|`|zRXkkh0Maa	You have to clean the paper under the cage, the millet and water everyday, bathe it once a week and clean the cage thoroughly every month with warm water. If you are able to do all these simple things, nothing will happen.    The most important is, when their waste looks weird, you have to bring it to the vet for cure immediately, any cure would not be at use after 24 hours. That's the big problem. ):    They CANNOT eat avacado, papaya and too much mango and peanuts.     They love to eat corn (raw), vegetables (raw), apple, grapes, mango and bread.    All the best.

It's pronounced ZIZZ-ickz. (It's from the show Kyle XY.) I can picture it well on an Aussie.    Steve Irwin (RIP!) had a dog named Sui. You could tweak that to be Zui, which makes me smile.

bZhIEy1Waa	Ahh bless him, ain't they just the cutest little things when they're so full of beans like that? Personally, in this day and age and with so many fighting dogs on our streets (UK) i'd keep him on lead unless you're in an area you know to be very safe ( my mate's dog was attacked and killed by two other dogs whilst out for a sunday stroll! ) Attempt to train him to heel and stay - i say attempt because he's so full of life he won't want to be reined in just yet, but its important he knows soon whats best for him and only you know that as his owner and keeper, feeder and carer! You can extend his lead if you wish, just get a length of strong rope and attach to his lead with proper metal clips and then he'll think he's got the freedom of the field until you pull him back ha ha - he'll realise then that its best to do as he's told! If you have difficulty training him or getting him to recognise your commands there are lots of dog training schools around and they're not expensive, around 3.00 - 4.00 an hour and the advantage in these schools is that you'll meet other people with 'mad' pup's who have an over enthusiastic approach to life and you'll meet others you can go for walks and rambles with, friends for you both! Hope everything goes well for you both, he sounds lovely!|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Teach him how to heel and ''stay''.

uHBvK4Vaaa	there are a number of problems that can cause hair loss:  --fleas, ticks, or ringworm (it's a fungus, not a worm)  --allergies (food allergies are the most common)  --hormonal imbalances  --psychological problems    It's very unlikely that your cat is dying if it's otherwise acting normal and happy. A visit to the vet can determine what the problem is so that you can begin to address it.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Yes you should take him to the vet.  But not one that's willing to mutilate your cat, but doesn't notice a large wound on him (presuming he had it when you took him in to be declawed).    It could be a lot of things I guess (eg flea or food allergy?), but I reckon a good bet is stress.  In that case having him declawed would certainly be a reason why it's got worse...  Having the tops of your fingers chopped off and suffering severe pain and losing much of the use of your hands would stress you out just a bit too.|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	He's got allergies. My dog does the same thing, and will scratch until he bleeds and is bald. Take him to the vet, where they will give him medicine to help the allergies. =)    PS: Also, getting a humidifier works too.

Edit: It didn't happen over the weekend.You said that he has been scratching at his ear since he was a kitten!!|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    It sounds like your cat may be allergic to something, and there are many things that cause allergic reaction in cats, ranging from fleas, to food allergies or allergies to mold and dust in the home. Additionally the cause for his chewing and scratching himself raw could be caused by anxiety about something in your household or upsets with other cats in your house to which you may not be aware.    I have a cat that chews on himself till the skin bleeds. It seems to happen in the Spring when everything is blooming. He gets treated now the moment he begins to display this behavior, so we can get it under control before it gets worse. The medication the vet prescribes stops the itch almost immediately.    You really do need to take him to the vet who can do a proper exam and diagnosis.    Here is an excellent article on skin disorders and allergies which can cause this condition you describe.  http://www.manhattancats.com/Articles/Sk...    The vet who wrote the article is an expert on cats.    Please do not do anything without consulting a vet.|`|hF4G3P1Maa	Sorry about all the dumb butts out there that are saying that you should have taken him to the vet A LONG time ago, you really couldnt stop it, and you already said that you had taken him to the vet,    ANYWAY:-)    I would call the vet, and see what they can do for you....|`|bQrXTUsxaa	Well, I would think that your cat, who you claim is developing a bald spot on his shoulder and right side of the head, probably from your cat attempting to still scratch his ear and around his ear without any claws. you see the claws did the real damage on your ctas ear, but now since the claws have been removed the scar or wound is no longer there because he's been declawed obviously. So the baldness on selected parts of your cats body is from the cats rubbing against other parts of its body attempting o get to his/her ear...but not being successful due to the lack of claws. Talk to your vet about dermititus.|`|K4W5K6dCaa	More probably allergic to somthing.. Our dog is ellergic to mites in the grass and they make her itch.  It could also be boredom.. but thats usually in dogs not cats    Take it to the vet.  Good luck.    Maybe try giving it a bath with a gentle pet shampoo like tea tree?
hYRYO5GYaa	chances are if its a light color and your around horses, its going to get dirty and stained
t6Ya3c3baa	Wolves are shy and timid; NOT aggressive. Your dog will protect you, but your wolf expects YOU to protect him!    Wolves make great pets, so long as they are not allowed to become the pack Alpha. (You, and your family, become the wolf's surrogate pack.) They are friendly family animals. A wolf is disciplined by holding him down in the submissive position.    My parents were given a hybrid puppy while they were living in a trailer park, where he saw many different people. They had him neutered when he was about half a year old. Luke was about 82% wolf. He was very sweet, friendly, good natured, and loving. Here is a link to a picture of Luke.  http://www.nbizz.com/colorfulsmartcat/li...    Luke was afraid of teacup poodles. He kissed lots of babies.    Of course, you must never act like a prey animal when you are with a wolf. Never run from a wolf. You must maintain your Alpha position, at all times.|`|t6UkxbBNaa	yes you can but......  My father had a friend who owned 'domesticated wolves' for YEARS until he went to feed them and they turned on him and killed him. Wolves have an obsession with blood if they see it they will go into a frenzy and keep going for more, that is why outdoorsman-people if they come across a wolf they cut the wolf's tongue and it will eventually kill it's self (it will keep lapping up it's own blood) (sorry for the weird sentence). I think wolves are totally amazing and I would love to own one but they are just way to dangerous. I wouldn't buy a wolf no matter how much the 'breeder' says they're domesticated.|`|PGkbPBZmaa	No, not without a doubt to the point where you can trust them. You always have to keep your guard up, they are wild animals that have not been domesticated and need to be allowed to be the animals they are. They have needs and instincts that need fulfilled, and thrive the natural stimulation of the wild.|`|bl8co4hUaa	No. However, dogs are evolved descendants of wolves, so there was a point in history when wolves were domesticated. This was done over many thousands of years. Today's wolves are not able to be domesticated. If you take one as a pup, it will show pack loyalty and affection, but it will always be a wild animal at the core, and it will inevitably turn on you, a family member, a friend, or someone else, and you will be held liable. (Not to mention, you would have to have a special permit to keep a wolf in some states, and other states won't allow it at all.)    A wolf-hybrid, the breeding of a domestic dog and a wolf, is also a large risk. The wolf instincts are powerful, and no matter how many "owners" of a wolf-hybrid will insist their doggy is loving and sweet, the point in fact is that it can never be fully trusted. Some states also do not allow wolf-hybrids. You will need to check the laws of your state in regards to wildlife to know what they will and will not allow and under what circumstances.    *clarifying edit* The domestication of wolves took many thousands of years and evolution to accomplish.|`|3vBALAlaaa	yeah, you can domesticate wolves. Cavemen once did it, and they were just like dogs. They are friendly if partially raised by humans and will act like a common house pet, but if not, they're savages.|`|oqiH3fCCaa	very rarely. I have see one in an animal show thing and it was eating entire chickens in seconds. but if they are domesticated, it should be from birth, but still they should never be completely trusted because they will always have some wild instincts.|`|iiKyR0e7aa	NO WAY!!! They are naturally wild and have instincts that could make them dangerous! If you want a wolf, get a dog instead!!|`|6cD9Ig2oaa	Not successfully. They will NEVER be fully domesticated. You could probably try, but it would just end in failure. They are wild and should be any other way. I've met a wolf hybrid once....that was enough for me.|`|wXrAqf8Caa	umm, well, it depends. if you have a 4 generation domestic wolf, yes i guess, just be really careful!

1tOr2qLAaa	I am not sure what Parrots of the World is, I live in CA. I have my African Grey's cut either at the Pet Shop here or if you look in the phone book under vets, and you find one that lists Exotic Birds then they will do nails and wings, here it is  about $20.00 for nails and $20.00 for a wing trim.  Don't let them get too long. As far as where you bought them, phone them an ask them if you can bring your Grey in for a nail and wing trim. Most places will have someone that will do follow up trims.  Good Luck!|`|5vGIaFkMaa	Hello Cristol  You should not assume your bird's nails need clipping.  Parrots are supposed to have sharp nails as this allows them to grip perches with confidence, and avoid falls.  Parrots should not have their wings clipped either; they should be taught flight requests as part of the normal training needed for a bird, so the bird flies to and from you on a verbal request to do so.|`|vMByDy1raa	Once they initially get their talons cut, they shouldn't need them cut except once a year at the most.  Their wings need clipped more often than their talons.   Get a sandy perch for you CAG and get  one for his out of cage perch also.  You don't want to trim his nail too close because they need this to hang on with.  If you clip their talons too close they could fall off of perches and when playing with their toys.  An CAG  is really a clumsy bird to begin with. He probably hanging on so tight because you are walking around too fast or he is afraid.  Use a  long sleeve shirt  so it doesn't hurt your skin.  If you get a sandy perch and put him on it you will notice a big difference within a week.|`|v6coHbIeaa	Are you sure he needs it.kind of young.|`|cWhfAU8Raa	I don't know where parrots of the world is but if u take your Congo to the vet they should be able to do it there hope this helps|`|qeOlkRM0aa	I guess you can call Parrots of the World and ask if they will clip your Grey's nails-they probably will. You can clip them yourself, if you are careful. The best thing to do is get him a cement perch, and make it his highest perch.This will naturally wear down his nails. I use them with all of my parrots. I haven't had to clip a parrot nail in well over 10 years.

asEeCmzraa	Ehh... Fish are easy. If you don't feed em, they find their own food. In fact, I feed my fish all different times- from six times a day for my guppy fry to every second day for my male fighters. <br>  Bottom feeders don't need much food. I've fed flakes, pellets, zucchinni(blanched quickly so it sinks, or anchored on a tank ornament) and the favourite- Algae wafers. Generally, these foods are only suppliments, I have a plentiful supply of micro algae all through my tank for them to feed on. <br>  I wouldn't exceed any more than once a day for full grown fish, as fish have a tendancy to eat and eat and eat, and they get fat very fast. Also, overfeeding will mess with your water quality. And never leave blanched vegetables in a tank for any more than about 5 hours, as it breaks down and fouls the water.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	once a day and you can feed then lettuce leafs only leave it in your tank for 4 hours
I8Tahe4Jaa	Teach him to ground drive. Then you can take him for walks and work his booty at the same time. I'm not very familiar with minis, but I would assume they can also be trained to pull a light cart with no ill effects, so maybe that's an option to up the calorie burning.     You could lunge, or walk him.     I would check him for worms, as his belly could be distended due to a worm burden.     I agree that you should evaluate his diet, but it might just be his conformation. Some horses just always look unfit because of how they are built, the way their barrel is shaped, etc., so don't exercise him to the point of damage or exhaustion if he's never going to trim down. My sister and I joke that my Quarab is Arab on the ends and QH in the middle because she has a massive QH barrel. She ALWAYS looks fat, even when she's very fit.     I would consult a vet if exercise, worming and careful slow changes to his diet don't put a dent in his belly.|`|Q6LPNIpVaa	Trying lunging him, put him out in the pastures more and change his diet.

XUEaEbTjaa	They need a fresh supply of Timothy hay every day. This is essential for them to have so do make sure you always have Timothy for them.<br>  <br>  Make sure the food you are feeding is fortified with Vitamin C. The best food available in stores is Oxbow Cavy Cuisine. Second to that in stores is Mazuri. These both have the right amount of vitamins and nutrients and are healthy for your guinea pig.<br>  <br>  Make sure you aren't giving iceburg lettuce or celery (too much water- no real nutritional value). If you are feeding salads (vegetables combined) use only dark green leafy vegetables as these are the most nutritious.  Carrots are fine in small amounts. Oranges only once a week as these can hurt a guinea pig's lips if given too frequently.<br>  <br>  Favorite treats of guinea pigs are salads.

Your piggie needs high Vit C foods like fresh green beans and parsley.  Fruits do not contain as much and can cause acid blisters on their mouth at times and are high in sugar, so use occasionally.  Timothy hay(available every day all day), not alfalfa, good quality fortified guinea pig pellets, and if you use bought treats, use occasionally as well.  You can grow the pet grass(wheat grass) for when you have no green grass outside to pick.  Be sure you trust that any outdoor grass you pick has not been treated with chemicals.  You'll read and hear conflicting things about some foods and treats.  For instance, lettuce( iceburg) can be ok in small amounts, as it can cause loose stools and has no real nutritional value, but they tend to really love it, so if you are having a salad and want to give him a bite, it's not going to harm him.  Celery is the same, but if you give it, you need to slice it small or remove the "strings", they can be swallowed whole and get bound up in the guts and cause major problems.  Another point of contention is yogurt treats.  It is accepted that guinea pigs don't tolerate dairy.  In my experience, my pig's favorite treat are the yogurt balls with timothy hay inside.  He has never had a problem with these and is a very healthy 6 yrs old....although not real sure on if these are real dairy or not.  Some people feed their pigs orange skins and not the fruity inside parts that we normally eat.  I guess the acid level is lower and doesn't cause as many problems, but I have not tried this.  With any fruit and veg, be sure to wash it before cutting or before feeding it because they will be extra sensitive to chemicals and disease.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	your guinea pig should always have a bowl of pellets ready to eat, you must change that bowl, every 3 days as they dope water in it so as what looks like food is just mush an the bottom of dish They need a treat of fresh greens in the morning and a little fruit at night, Along with the good pelet they must have timothy hay all the time, This is not only very good for their digestive system but it helps keep hie teeth from glowing to much and prevents a trip ti a vet.They can not eat to much timothy hat, but be sure to get the good kind that has blooms and a lot of leafs on it<br>  Also you want to use the vitamin in the water as guinea pigs can not store vitamin C it just goes right though them and them heed a huge supply of it.<br>  <br>  Have a great time with your little buddy|`|nPdKJyK4aa	I have a HUGE fresh veggie and fruit list that I wrote on our guinea pig forum.

Their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life.Most grass-eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In older boars (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass.] The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs benefit from feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in addition to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though there exists some controversy over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a source for replenishment of protein, amino acids and fiber.<br>  <br>  Like humans, but unlike most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10 mg (0.15 gr) of vitamin C daily (20 mg (0.31 gr) if pregnant), which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements.Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets have been associated with muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Some sources also suggest[weasel words] that guinea pigs are especially susceptible to gall and kidney stones, making it important to limit calcium intake in their diet. This may involve limiting or eliminating multi-vitamin supplements and calcium-rich foods (like commercially-produced yogurt drops, spinach or very high proportions of alfalfa).[citation needed] Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity.They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accepting new food types.A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely gnaw, lest their teeth become too large for their mouth, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs will also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.<br>  <br>  A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, potato, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax and wild celery.Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.g., tulip and onion) is normally considered poisonous.|`|SwN42MBBaa	Ok I saw that you have loads of answers but 2 put it easily 2 u:<br>  Veg:<br>  Carrots(+peelings)<br>  Broccoli (they luv it and you can get the stalks free from tesco/superquinn or you just look in the boxes at the supermarkets)<br>  Lettuce (not to much)<br>  (A little) cabbage<br>  <br>  Fruit:<br>  Apples (+peelings)<br>  Dry stuff:<br>  Sunflower seeds (tasty treat)<br>  Dry guinea pig mix<br>  Hay<br>  <br>  Other stuff:<br>  Grass<br>  Dandelions (they love them)<br>  <br>  My mum and I have had lots experiences with guinea pigs|`|HocHwequaa	Your piggies should have pellets and timothy hay available at all times.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  If this were my cat, I would be taking him to the vet for an xray. There could be something going which is not visible to you which is only hurting your cat sporatically, which is why your cat may be exhibiting the problem from time to time. It may be caused by damage to a ligament, tendon or joint. Since young cats are so active, he may have injured himself in his enthusiastic play.<br>  <br>  Additionally young cats are active and full of themselves so may tend to  "bypass" a pain message in preference to  playing, just like humans do at times.  Cats also instinctually hide physical pain as a survival strategy.<br>  <br>  I don't think you can assume anything. Since this has been going on for awhile, it would be prudent to have your cat's leg examined to make sure that there is nothing serious going on.<br>  <br>  For an interesting article about limping in cats, visit: <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2215311_treat-cat-limp-injuries.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2215311_treat-ca...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and I do hope there is nothing serious going on with your kitty and he soon is "limp free."<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|DtkLsetkaa	Sounds like he has a splinter or something stuck in there, since he can sometimes be ok on it and other times it really hurts.

gb6wgo3paa	Sounds like your little guy has an Upper Respiritory Infection (URI). He needs to be put on ferret-safe antibiotics (and a pro-biotic powder so he doesn't get diarrhea from the antibiotics). Ferrets go downhill rather fast so please take him to a vet asap. If you put your ear up to his chest do you hear the wheezing? I have had ferrets live way longer than 5 so he's not extremely old and this isn't from his age, it is an infection if he does this all the time.    Also at petco, they sell this liquid you give to rabbits to get rid of URI's. If he isn't too bad, you can try that (I've had it recommended to me) but chances are it won 't work because it sounds like it is way too advanced in stage and he'll need full-on antibiotics. Please see your vet, antibiotics for this are rather in-expensive ($20 or so for the full 2 weeks) but the vet will charge you an office visit price.    Buy him some "Uncle Jim's Duk Soup" powder from Petco or Petsmart and feed it to him frequently throughout the day (kinda watery to keep him hydrated). Don't force him to eat it, just offer as much as he is willing to eat so he doesn't end up losing weight and dying from dehydration or self-starvation.    Another thing to look at is if he only does this occasionally, when he chews or eats his food, does it turn to dusty powder? I fed mine a food that was so dry it ended up turning to powder when they bit it and they would inhale it in and choke when they were eating.    He could also do this from a  "dusty" brand of litter. Please try to switch over to newspapers or carefresh (put some poop in the pan when changing to this as they will think it is a play-box and dig it all the time ;but not if they smell their poop in there. Change them daily) for at least 3 weeks and see if the wheezing stops to eliminate this as a possibility too. I only give mine litter that has no perfumes as mine are allergic (as well as me too, it makes me sputter and cough).    Hope I helped you out some to determine what it is caused from and helped to eliminate the cause or treat him.|`|wXrAqf8Caa	im not sure how old ferrets can live but if this is how old they are supposed to live this  long............... anyway! i think you should take him to the vet ASAP just incase!!! he might need some meds or it could be a very important lung prob!|`|ErcsrWtJaa	Take the little guy to the vet.

If you're interested in buying one, hold it first and look at their eyes and listen to their breathing.  If their eyes aren't runny or goopy, and their breathing is pretty much soundless, then go for it.  Plus, they should have a policy that you get to take it back within a certain amount of days.  If they don't..I wouldn't reccomend buying from there.  If they get sick, you can take it to the vet and if there is something wrong, they should pay your bill, that's what most pets stores do here in Phoenix.    Hope that helps and sorry that doesn't answer your question specifically.  Good luck.
s80ED7Ygaa	Just don't get the house. Or just get the pidgeon out and fix it up.
DrvCh24caa	This is common and I asked my vet about it because My puppy was doing the same thing. Why they eat so fast is because when they're puppies they have to compete with their siblings for food, so in order to get food they gotta go fast, to risk getting pushed or shoved out of the way by a bigger sibling.     Don't overfeed your dog!! Give your dog exactly what they're suppose to get for their age and weight, no more, regardless of how fast they eat, they're getting the same portion.     All we did was split up her food into two separate sittings that were 10 mins apart. So if you're suppose to give her a cup a meal, we'd give her half a cup, let her eat REALLY fast, wait 10 mins, and give her the rest. The reason why is so she knows that it'll keep coming.     Our puppy grew out of it, now she's a lesuire eater:) I wouldn't worry about it , just be patient!|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Well, I'm just throwing a random thing you can try.    Sit next to him as he eats and once it becomes to fast, calmly place your hand on his chest and push him back slowly and say caaalllm. The release him, repeat.    (Sorry, for some reason the entire answer didn't post)|`|np6W9hnsaa	For each meal break it up into tiny portions. When he needs to be fed give him a little food and let him eat it. Wait a minute or so and give him the next small portion of food. Keep doing that until the food for that time is finished.   Eating to fast can be a problem in his later years, leading to bloat.|`|JLrs8bxdaa	That's bad for his health.  When you feed him, stand there and drop the bits in one by one, waiting untill he has eaten the first to put in the next.  It takes time, but if you do this enough, he will pick up on the habbit of eating slower.
Rx7wv4JLaa	The ideal weight for all dogs is to be able to pet along the side of your dog and feel their ribs lightly but not be able to see them.     However at 12 weeks old its pretty hard to tell what is the best weight b/c they are in the middle of their growing stages. As long as their belly isn't really big and you are feeding them according to how much the bag of food suggest you give for your pups weight and age you should be fine.|`|fDVUbzv2aa	what was the mother and father it should be between there if you don't know then feel your dogs ribs and if you can feel them somewhat but they're not very visible that's pretty healthy make sure to feed him good dog food and you should be ok|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	I'm not entirely sure on the kg's, but at twelve weeks your dog should healthily be between 15 and 20 pounds.|`|EBeUj5tuaa	Maybe like 20lbs|`|0a07f2e5a084ebc8ae39f790612c5390aa	I got my Pit Bull when he was about 12 weeks I took him to the vet that same week I got him and he weighed 21lbs they told me that was a healty weight and he should put on a couple pounds a week.. Another thing they told me was to not limit his intake of food til hes about 7 months since he is a large breed puppy and he needs lots of nutrients so feed him about 3 cups a day.. Now mine is about 17months and weighs 95lbs good luck!!!!
hKXIeur6aa	Just because you have eggs, does not mean you have a pair.   It is not uncommon for two female angelfish to pair up and take turns laying eggs. All you can do is wait. If the eggs turn foggy or start growing fungus on them, they are most likely unfertilized and need to be removed.   Watch for signs of courtship or the other angel fertilizing the eggs to determine if you have a male-female pair.|`|XcxCXW9taa	First of all it's angEL fish. =). Otherwise people might think you're talking about geometry. Second of all, female fish lay eggs just like women have menstruation. Usually male fish are more colorful than female. If you have a colorful angel fish and a not so colorful angel fish, you might be facing babies.
ErcsrWtJaa	That depends on you. We like dogs better...but I have a lot of time to spend with ours. Dogs need a lot of love and attention.....cats do not.    If you are always busy and don't have the time to play with a dog or take him for walks...then you will want a cat. Cats give you attention when they want to do so and are perfectly happy to be by themselves.    You can leave a cat in the house alone for the weekend and he will be just fine. You cannot do that with a dog.|`|wxRPKEeYaa	Cats, because they can take care of themselves, while dogs can't.|`|7ro9anqFaa	I think dog is more friendly

The other thing is that if you don't clean this area thoroughly, kitty thinks it's the pee area. They smell it and think they're doing the right thing. Does it have a door? Can you make it the litter area? If it's a functional front closet, you may want to block access after it's clean to break the habit. Kitties also like to pee on plastic, I'm told, so if you had any there (or anywhere) pick it up. You might need some diligence and patience to work this out.     I had some issues like this with my kitty (the worst was when she peed on my insurance bill) and wound up changing her food, ultimately to one sold thru a vet that works against crystal formation in the kidneys. I also learned not to leave plastic available to her since some kitties cannot resist it.|`|P0f21SrWaa	lmao its just a kitten calm down and does the cat even have a litter box? cuz maybe you should show the cat it so it knows its there .... :D|`|DSrBxZcYaa	Like Spraying.... If that's what you are talking about, Spay or Neuter, Some pet stores have sprays, that set Limits, But for peeing litter box, if you think he is about to pee pick him up put him in the litter box if he  goes back, put him back, or put the litter box in ur closet and he will eventually get that he needs to use the litter box and you can eventually move it. God Bless You!|`|U0ukLT9uaa	My cat Sunshine used to pee in the front closet all the time!  It drove me nuts.  These are my suggestions:    1.  First, make sure that your kitten isn't sick.  After I took my cat to the vet I found out that she had a urinary track infection.  She peed in the closest because peeing in the litter box = pain!    2.  If your kitten gets a clean bill of health from the vet, check out her environment.  Maybe kitty hates her old litter box or even where it is located.  Do some investigation.     3.  Have you recently brought another pet to live in your house?  Kitty might be trying to tell you that she doesn't like the new pet.    4.  Try moving the cat's litter box to the closet (if you can).  She might start using it again.|`|0509a790fe9f326fe979c75e17a81017aa	Put a diaper on him.|`|bSr3WeXNaa	Set a boundary.|`|MGxDgsKZaa	1. Break his habit by keeping the door closed.  2. Clean the area thoroughly with Nature's Miracle or another enzymatic cleaner. Use a UV light to make sure you've cleaned up all the pee (you can get a small one at most pet stores).  3. Get him neutered if you haven't already, so he won't have the urge to mark his territory.  4. Make sure the litter box is as inviting as can be. Keep it super clean, uncovered, in a convenient (but easy to escape from) location, away from noisy appliances and nowhere near the cat's food.  5. If the problem persists, consult your vet. He or she will check your cat for health problems and suggest ways to change your cat's behavior or reduce its anxiety.    Good luck!|`|IGkm98Qqaa	Close the closet door maybe? put a liter box in the closet? kill it? make the closet into a bathroom?

Your so lucky to have such a cutie pie|`|mcKKdbhgaa	It is a regular dog...    Nothing special in the looks dept., but I'm sure she is special to you- that is all that matters.    Why not make your own calendar of her and give it to people.|`|TxecTL1aaa	she is so cute and she could be in a magazine i think she is cute and the people who said she is ugly you know what there even more UGLY and is she a golden retriever or a bright yellow lab anyway she is very cute|`|xBixbBxoaa	yeah why would you ask such a silly question|`|SeUFlsawaa	Absolutely adorable|`|eulWfKOfaa	She's very pretty! |`|XkICYiymaa	awwwww that is the cutest little puppy I have ever seen.
hGY08GjRaa	just wipe it with a damp cloth<br>  <br>  You know how when you sleep YOU get cust around your eyes.. sometmes more than others?? Well for cats this is usually brownish... that's probably all it was..  your cat was in a deep sleep for the surgery..and his/her eyes were producing some mucous. which dried up as a crusty goo..<br>  <br>  Just keep your eyes open for any signs of a "Cold" or overly runny eyes.. I'm sure she/he is fine..|`|oojO4WAraa	Just put a wet rag on it to soften it and wipe it away.  The poor kitty went through a traumatic thing.  It is probably just left over from surgery.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Your cat may have picked up a URI at the clinic.  Anytime there are several cats in one enclosed area, there is risk of spreading infection.  Call the vet and let them know so they can give your kitty some medicine to clear it up.
AA10229248	I schedule feed. There are so many reasons for it:<br>  <br>  1. Dogs that eat around the same time poop around the same time. Makes it much easier to schedule potty breaks.<br>  <br>  2. Dogs don't get overweight.<br>  <br>  3. Dogs don't fight over food.<br>  <br>  4. Dogs may have to be boarded some day and kennels do not free feed.<br>  <br>  The list goes on and on.<br>  <br>  Basically, my dogs are fed second thing in the morning. First thing is take them out to potty. They're fed again approximately 12 hours after the first feeding. This is mostly because one of my dogs has to take medicine at 12 hour intervals. So they get a 6:30 am feeding and a 6:30 pm feeding. They're to the point where if I'm even 10 minutes late with the evening feeding I hear about it. They KNOW when it's feeding time. LOL!<br>  <br>  With small dogs, I might recommend three feedings instead of two. Some small dogs suffer from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) if they get too hungry. So you could feed them right around the time you have breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br>  <br>  For the amount of food, talk to your vet or check the recommended amount listed on the bag of food and divide that by the number of feedings. If it says 1 cup a day, and you feed three times a day, you'll give them 1/3 cup at each feeding.<br>  <br>  Because you're going from free feeding to scheduled feeding, you may have to supervise them for a while to make sure one doesn't eat all his food and then help himself to the other dogs' food.|`|9kTejB0uaa	This is the very reason why we've never 'been able' to free feed - we've always had numbers, and doing this you simply can't be sure who is getting what.  And it wouldn't ever work with Bassets!!!<br>  <br>  I feed mine twice a day, breakfast and late afternoon.  And when we had numbers,  I had to stand guard until everybody finished otherwise there was a free for all.  The bowls always went down in the same order, names called, and in the same places.  Again otherwise there would be a free for all.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I can't help you with amounts because my lot had just a wee bit more than a toy breed would need.  I know that the amounts of a bag have no relationship to what mine would eat - if they had what was recommended, they would explode!!  Why don't you contact a breeder of your breeds for amounts?|`|GSf09ALBaa	Yep, that sounds great.  I am a little late in getting in here but I can't really help you with your 3 wee ones.  <br>  <br>  I have a pack of 9.  And then I foster.  So most of the time I have 10 to 12 dogs.  They are all different breeds/mixes/ages/sizes.<br>  <br>  Everyone is fed once a day.  In their kennels.  Everyone has great body weight and if I see someone getting a little chunky or someone getting a bit thin, I have complete control over the portions.  <br>  <br>  This is what works for me.  Between 1 and 2 every day.  Occasional treats of course.|`|b4NcFBhraa	It's best to follow a recomendation if hte dog actually DOES freefeed. IF he freefeeds but only eats out of the bowl a little like 3-4 times a day, it's fine.<br>  I schedule feed my dog, I give my dogs 1 cup of food 2-3 times a day (3 if I dunno that someone's already fed them) 1 at night and 1 in the morning :D<br>  If the dog is overwieght (1-3 lbs over the average) then she should be schedule feeding him. It's not that hard to feed them after you eat in the morning and after you eat dinner. For a chihuahua or pom pom he may only need like 1/2 cup once a day or something. The can or bag will have a reccomended serving size. If you're still unsure you can google "chihuahua(or pomeranian) feeding and serving sizes"<br>  Hope htis helps you out :D|`|eDySIDPQaa	Nope, scheduled feeding only, I do not think a dog should be allowed to eat all the time......free feeding can also cause bloat, the dog eats all day, and drinks all day as well;, the food swells, bam  bloat and you risk the chance of loosing your dog.<br>  <br>  My babies get fed am and pm, and then their little snacks about midday, does not affect them eating.....cause you restrict the intake of treats as well.<br>  <br>  Free feeding can also cause a dog to get finicky and stop eating, too much food......gets tired of it...and then people go oh my dog won't eat and can't figure out why....<br>  <br>  scheduled feeding always.<br>  <br>  have a great day everyone|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	First off a dog shouldn't be able to get his food when he wants it, it should be earned every day.  The pack leader always eats first.  That can help with behavior problems.  Secondly you should feed twice a day once in the morning once at night leave the bowl out for 30 Min's after that pick it up.  How much you should feed your dog? If you have a higher Quality type of food, it should not be as much as cheap dog food, There are instructions on the package of the food, so read it. Small dogs should be fine with a cup a day, one in the morning one at night.  But read your instructions on the label brand of dog food.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	Interesting...<br>  Well, I have an australian shepherd, who gets fed twice a day. 6am and 6pm (ish) We also have a puppy that gets fed 3 times a day for now. It had its pros and cons to provide free feeding I guess. If you want to continue to free feed your dog, make sure he gets enough exercise, to work off all that food. but I would suggest to schedule your feeding and/or supervise your dogs while they eat to make sure everyone of them gets the right amount of food. <br>  Good luck! :o)|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	What was the point of telling us you cut a piece of his ear off?<br>  <br>  Anyway...just look at the back of the bag of food you feed them to see how much they should eat daily, and split that up into like 2 meals a day.<br>  It isn't that hard.<br>  <br>  I feed my dog in the morning when I wake up and then again at 5 pm.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	(prepared to be beaten about the head and neck) I free feed ... but that said ... when schedule feeding you might want to separate the dogs otherwise your little porker might eat the other dog's food as well.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i dont work and stay home all day. i feed once a day. i feed in the afternoon around 3 pm because this gives them all evening to poop before i go to bed. if you wanted to feed twice a day you could do so in the morning around 9 am and then again in the afternoon, but it is not necessary to do so. for your own convince and because it wont effect the dog, i recommend once a day feeding, which leads to once a day pooping.<br>  ex schedule:<br>  between 8-9 AM- wake up and let dogs out<br>               10 AM- take dogs for short walk<br>               10:30-3:00- do what you need to do for the day<br>               3 PM- feed dogs and let them out after they eat<br>               4-5 PM walk dogs<br>               then let the dogs go out again before you go to bed<br>  <br>  this works well for my babies and my schedule, you can alter it as you need to fit yours|`|zxxt4KZHaa	I am totally against free feeding, specially in small dogs because even they are tiny some of them love to eat and will do it nonstop. <br>  <br>  I have 2 small dogs, and I have them in a schedule, at 9am and then at 6pm. Feed them half of their food in the morning and half at night. For small dogs, it depends on the type of food but its usually one cup or cup and a half. If you are not sure ask your vet.  <br>  <br>  Besides reducing the food for you little Taz, take him out for walks more often, less food and exercise will do wonders.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|cnZlMojUaa	I have feed both ways and schedule feedings are much better for my dogs. When one of my dogs got very sick, and I could not tell the emergency vet how much she was eating, I realized it was a problem.<br>  <br>  I now feed my dogs 2 meals a day. One in the a.m.; one in the p.m. I actually feed my dogs in separate rooms, basically because they eat different foods. By scheduling the feedings, I know how much they are eating, I can know if one dog is having an "off" appetite, and I can be in control of what they are eating. Having the poops on schedule is a side benefit. : )<br>  <br>  If I am reading correctly, you are planning to feed each dog a cup of food in the a.m. and a cup in the p.m. This sounds like quite a lot of food for toy breeds. My smaller dog only gets 1 cup a day total and she weighs more than your dogs. You are also comparing a pom body shape to a chi body shape. They are not the same dog breed, so their bodies will look different. Your vet can let you know if your pom is overweight and help you with a weight-loss program if needed. Increasing the pom's exercise will also help with his weight. They all sound like cutie-pies.
AA11901352	If you have large goldfish they shouldn't be changing colors.  Although genetics will play a roll in if and when or even if they change at all, the main reason goldifsh will change color is due to diet and poor breeding.  White is not a dominant color for a goldfish (you didn't say what kind and if they are commons or comets they will not hold a white color).  Heater will not affect their color at 72 degrees.  72 is fine for goldfish across the board here.  Neutrition plays a key roll in fish colors, and unfortunately there are no color enhancers for white just golds and reds.   Color is simply a pigment.  One way to slow the process is to actually leave the lights out longer than they are on.  <br>  <br>  If you do not know the breeding background of your fish, there is no way of telling if he will retain any white at all.<br>  <br>  And goldfish don't molt.  Some will change color as they age however most will hold their color at maturity.  2-3 years.<br>  <br>  Nothing to worry about here.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Goldfish may change color as they mature, but in this case I would blame the heater. Raising the temperature may increase their metabolism.<br>  <br>  Please don't keep plecos with goldfish. You cannot keep both fish happy in this case. The pleco requires tropical temperatures to thrive, 77F-82F. Much too high for a goldfish.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	They are not sick do not worry i have had these kind of gold fish for years and i love them! Once they are born they are a sort of bluish white color with black eyes right? well as they get older they begin to molt and become a beautiful bronze color with black splotches. nothin at all to worry about cause they are just wonderful! But plecos need warm enviornments as goldfish need cool so they dont really mesh.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Elizabeth K is right...goldfish need cooler water temp. I never kept any pleco or cories with them as golds are great at cleaning their own tanks. Warming up the water may have brought on spawning colors. I've seen orange go white, white go orange, orange and black become completly orange. The main thing with golds is the filteration system and plenty of oxygen pumped in.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It sounds like yor fish may have Ick or Rusk. Go to walmart and get some start right drops and put them in you tank. This happened to my fish and these diseases can and will kill them it will spread to the other fish if no treatment is done. Fish don't change color for no reason.|`|qCBkCMlWaa	My mum has some fish in a pond, one of our carp started turning black eventually it went back to its normall colour, dont know if this is the same for yours however, sorry
w9aR8ymGaa	Hitting or Physical Abuse - It is pretty much the bully theory...they are not in control of their own lives (either abused themselves or have bad lives that they do not have the brains or power to overcome) so they need a scape goat, something smaller and weaker than themselves to hurt so that they themselves will feel more powerful.<br>  <br>  Puppy Mills - Greed.  Plain and Simple.  No compassion for life.  This is usually bred into humans and also depends on their upbringing.  Those with no compassion are generally those who were never shown compassion themselves.<br>  <br>  Neglect - Sometimes severe depression can cause people to not have the energy to take care of another being.  Or they are so selfish and wrapped up in their own lives that they simply don't care to take the time to care for their responsibilities. <br>  <br>  The same reason people abuse their children and/or spouses.  Also there is a proven link between those who abuse animals and those who abuse humans.|`|GllB4mPZaa	Innosenceness.|`|knFrwCxcaa	BECAUSE THEIR SICK WHY DON'T THEY PICK ON SOMEONE BIGGER THEN THEY ARE THEY WONT BE SO TOUGH THEN WOULD THEY|`|DvjbTNXvaa	Because most of the people r stupid enough to believe that animals don't have feelings or they think it's fun to see an animal suffer! those people can also be literate people, not only illiterate.<br>  those people can be so cruel!i've seen these many times(i live in India), people tie bombs and crackers to stray dog's tails' and them burst them!<br>  small kids hurt stray dogs by throwing stones, get bitten and then people go on killing the dogs!I've seen more than 10 dogs like this,now they are so scared of humans.One of my neighbour's dogs{all are stray =) }had a eye damaged so badly that the whole thing became red!<br>  I personally HATE people who do this!<br>  =(|`|zKyy1gE2aa	I wish I knew the answer to this question so we could stop animal abuse.

They would not dare to abuse a fiercer animal.<br>  <br>  But for those who abuse bigger animals like pit-bulls, horse, cows, etc.. they are really evil and might soon turn to targeting fellow human beings.<br>  <br>  Thats why animal abuse is mostly not tolerated in any society, in fear that the perpetrator might also turn to abuse other human beings.|`|f96ecf10164e7f3a9da36cca8ac9ce14aa	I believe its because people view animals as stupider than they are, and its easy to blame something for all your troubles when it can't talk back and it can't really defend itself fairly against whats attacking it.<br>  Plus, I don't believe they realize how special a bond with a pet can be.<br>  Put simply, people that abuse their animals are stupid.|`|GYmgfZj9aa	Because they have nothing else to do with there time.

I do not think over time its good for the brain if you know what I mean. <br>  <br>  I think of a horse with a mirror of it self and I think of that character off of 'Finding Nemo", I think her name was Flo that character that talked to her reflection. Yeah I could see something happening like that lol.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	your horse can get really hurt doing that! but you could try and find a buddy at the barn that he can go out with. if not look put some free horses, i have seem a lot that can still be riding the Only reason for given away is they can't afford it!|`|y7H1V39Jaa	I totally agree with Dutchess, it doesn't cost much to keep a pony, mini or goat and makes more sense than a mirror in the field|`|mKWwz1uUaa	Well to me it's not really worth the risk, I just adopted a pony for my gal to have a pal, you might want to think about finding a buddy, small pony, goat (my girl didn't like it, but may do), plus really I would worry they would do to much standing next the the mirror, not enough grazing, walking around and so.  I personally think you should pass.  Best of luck,<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Even if it's shaterproff I worry they horse would be standing in one spot with the mirror and not moving about, streaching, eating, drinking enough water before it's really thirty, movment is the best for a horse and also a great way to help prevent colic.  I really advice for health reasons against it.  You horse like mine is board about out and out about, running aroudn which is very good for them, muscles, bowelmovments, hoofes, lungs, heart and so on, it's okay that she's goin "nuts" lol mine does too but she's has survied for over 2 yrs with out a pal, she's gettin one but really think about it.  Best of luck.  Take care

TqIdbEBPaa	Your oranda is very pretty. It looks pretty healthy and it is in a good environment. It has very beautiful colors, decent head growth, and a long flowing fin.<br>  <br>  Show-quality goldfish are usually based on size, color, wen (head growth) and long-flowing fins. But, what they are mostly judged on are color and size.<br>  <br>  To make it grow bigger and more colorful, feed it high protein foods (which makes them grow faster and their head growths grow faster too) and also feed them foods high in Beta-Carotene for color enhancing.<br>  <br>  I recommend Pro-Gold Goldfish food, Hikari Oranda Gold and Hikari Lionhead, and Saki-Hikari. These foods are very popular and I heard good reviews about them. Also, feed her freeze-dried or frozen bloodworms and brine shrimp as a high-protein treat (once a week or so). You can feed her earthworms occasionally too. Feed green vegetables, peas, or spirulina flakes twice a week to clean out the goldfish's system.<br>  <br>  It is also based on genetics and water quality. If it comes from very unhealthy parents, it won't grow very well and if the water conditions are bad, it will stunt its growth.<br>  <br>  edit: don't listen to anyone who says your fish looks ugly.|`|JdcNTholaa	yours is to ugly it wouldent win sh!t haahah

In both cases the name 'horse'  is applied out of honour for the breed as it were.<br>  <br>  Here in the UK some ponies are being bred bigger than their breed standards used to be - eg welsh cobs are ponies but they can legitimately be up to 15hh, similarly with Haflingers nowadays, they're calling them 'sport haflingers' or some such. Same applies to 'working hunter ponies' which I think equates roughly with the US hunter jumper classes. Their classes range up to 15hh but they are classed as 'ponies'<br>  <br>  On the flip side polo ponies are only ever horse sized (over 14.2hh) <br>  <br>  To sum up it pysically it's one hundred percent sure over 14.2hh is a horse, unless by breed definition or particular eccentricity of the owner it is called what it is not :)|`|6S1OBwtYaa	A pony is an equine 14.1 hh and below.<br>  <br>  A horse is an equine 14.2 hh and below.<br>  <br>  I don't think it is possible for a pony to be 15 hands high.

Some people on here belong to breed associations and might be able to look him up for you.|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	How old is the horse that you bought? I'd give a lucky guess and say that he's already passed. It's pretty hard to track down any not well known horses.|`|2cuV3Koyaa	I think you need to re type your question without the spelling mistakes as I would imagine no one is really sure what you are actually asking|`|SIWPuGMlaa	i have not heard of him, sorry
3YHZUuhyaa	I think you'll be fine but you might look a little weird. Your weight is fine as long as the horse is healthy and sound. i think your boyfriend will be ok on him as long as he doesn't do a lot of cantering/jumping.

It's not the height that matters, but the weight.<br>  <br>  Though... because of your tall height, you might look awkward on the horse depending on how the hose is built.<br>  <br>  Again, depending the built of the horse, your bf could or could not ride him. Is he fit and strong, or slender/ skinny/ small boned?<br>  <br>  If you can't decide, just ride him before buying. Have your boyfriend walk and trot him, and see if the horse accepts his weight. If so, then have him canter. If the horse seems completely okay and calm, then you should be fine.<br>  <br>  If not, I would rethink the situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Well, your weight should be fine. Just have your bf try out the horse.|`|yBiFF5Viaa	240 pounds is the maximum limit you should put on a horse. 14.2 hh is a little small, but he should be able to carry you and your bf just fine.

You might look a little awkward being 5'9 and all. Unless the horse is really stocky, and has alot of muscle, then I wouldn't advise a 210 pound person to ride. Also, at 6'3, he would look VERY VERY strange on such a short horse.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1uRUaSblaa	No harm trying...just ask your bf to get off from it if it collapse half way.
Y5FyAekkaa	Start your puppy on  a heartworm preventative right away...its never too early.  Heartgard is considered a Rx product so you will likely need a vet to dispense it. It is an orally chew tablet that is given once a month and works by inhibiting heartworm larvae from implanting in the dogs heart and growing in to worms. Even on preventative it is still a good idea to get regular heartworm tests usually every 1-2 years. There are lots of product out there, my personal favorite is the Interceptor which works much the same way.  Also keep in mind that most oral heartworm preventatives are "retroactive" meaning that they would take care of any potential infection that may have occured in the preceding months. This is important if you live in an area like up north where you don't give it during the winter and need to know when to stop for the season.|`|LURQBU86aa	You can start giving it to your dog now. It's a chewable beef flavored tablet that's given once a month every month.|`|I38WF5aFaa	It depends where you live.  Heartworms are spread by mosquitoes.  Therefore Heartguard is not needed for part of the year in areas with cold winters.  Because of how it works,  killing worms up to one month old,  you don't need to start giving it until one month after the beginning of mosquito season.  Then give it to him once a month.  The vet will want to test him for heartworms before prescribing Heartguard.  If he tests positive he will need treatment, not prevention.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Pups should be started on heartworm preventative by about 8 weeks of age and have a bloodtest for heartworms by about 7 months of age, even if they are on preventative.  After that, the dog should be tested yearly for heartworms and kept on preventative year round.  Yes, year round.  The recommendation used to be that in the winter months, when mosquito numbers were down, you could stop the preventative, but it's been found to be much more affective for all dog to be on preventative all year no matter where they live.
nooi0ldjaa	you could keep it as a pet, if it lives. you might need to seek a vet's help with cleaning it up, just because you cant see anything wrong doesn't mean every things ok, but im sure you know that. but after its away from its mother, and never taught how to live on its own, in the wild, letting it go would mean death for sure. there's no bottles of water and bowls of food in the wild lol. so if your going to keep it, just keep it.<br>  if its even legal in your area, im not sure. the most lawful thing to do would be to call your local DNR, and ask if they know of any wildlife resuces around.<br>  <br>  but, if you know how to take care of the rabbit, you can do it. if its legal in your area.<br>  <br>  food - rabbit pellets work fine, depending on how young it is, it still might need mothers milk.<br>  <br>  water- get a over sized gerbil water bottle. simple.|`|oPrq7v7Saa	If it is legal to keep rabbits in California, then yes you can take the rabbit in, but once you take it in you'll have to keep because it won't know how to survive in the wild. You can domesticate a wild bunny, especially as a baby. Four years ago I had baby bunny's (3) in my backyard and my dog ate the mother. I called the vet before touching the baby's and they said it is perfectly legal to keep wild bunny's, but you can't release them once in your care or they will most definitely die. The vet told me to feed them kitten milk that you can buy at any store or pet store. Also have rabbit pellets, grass and a water bottle for them. I still own the rabbits to this day and they are very loving! However, being your dog got a hold of it you should have it checked out by a vet just to be on the safe side. It could be injured internally.|`|FODZBCtraa	Sure check his stomach see if its full. Feed him natural greens but stay away from lettuce. Many people will tell you that you cannot domesticate a rabbit, but you can. If you leave him there the mother will come back at nigh, thats the only time you see her.|`|AA11463826	no i dont want to be mean but if you dont work at a wildlife center then your best thing to dowouldbe give it to a wildlife center tey have delt with it before!!! if you have never had this happen thats what u need to do! they can take proper care of it!!!|`|GPO4UsyKaa	yes feed it karrets chopes up<br>  <br>  rice and fruits and vegies.<br>  <br>  when it gets used to its cage it will jump and hop and run|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Mother rabbits hide their babies and come by to check on them when they feel it's safe. <br>  <br>  It's better to leave the rabbit where it is and let nature run its course than take it in your home. Taking a wild rabbit it can easily kill these creatures with kindness. If you take it away from it's mother and the wild it won't have the skills to survive in the wild. Or it could die in captivity because of the stress.
m16gf9mzaa	This sounds like the kind of feline problem that requires veterinary attention. Please do call and make an appointment for her as soon as possible.  It could be something as simple as food allergies, or it could be something more serious.  So please do not delay any further on getting her the care she needs.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I kind of sounds like a parasite, which is pretty easy to treat.  Take your cat to the vet.  If it is a parasite, they can give you some pills to get rid of it.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	Have you been worming the cat on a regular basis?<br>  <br>  Sometimes cats will chase and eat lizards which will make them skinny plus any mice or birds etc. that they eat as well can give them worms.<br>  <br>  Has the cat had all its vaccinations?<br>  <br>  If she's sneezing it could be feline flu and this is very serious and needs to be treated by a vet.<br>  <br>  Either way, at this age (65 human years) with all the symptons it has, the cat really needs to be checked out by a vet as soon as you can.

iXijnCxOaa	What its going to take is teaching children responsibility, critical thinking skills, strength to go their own way and not give into peer pressure, and basic compassion.<br>  <br>  Things are only going to get WORSE (both for animals and children) before it gets better due to the namby pamby, permissive parenting and a society that believes in "participation ribbons".<br>  <br>  This has been escalating since the late 60's .. and now the children of that first generation of permissively parented children are going even farther since they have no sense of boundaries and their parents had no clue how to guide them.<br>  <br>  When will it stop... When people quit giving their little brats permission to play on the floor at a restaurant rather than requiring they sit nicely on a chair... When people quit allowing their little brats to parent themselves via the internet and video games .. When society insists they engage in actually THINKING beyond what THEY want.<br>  <br>  I see nothing changing anytime soon ~ if what you see here on Yahoo Answers is any indication... a plethora of permissively parented know -it-all brats who make no attempt to listen or learn if they don't LIKE how you speak your opinion... its common in society and its danged SAD.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	I can't even think of anything to say because it is so disgusting.<br>  Unfortunately Spain has weak animal cruelty laws and they are rarely enforced. Hopefully Regina's story will gain enough attention that the government is pressured to seek justice for her, if not out of compassion for the poor dog, then to quell the outrage and save face from the rest of the world.|`|AA12308199	Horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  It breaks my heart.  They probably won't ever know who did this to that poor, beautiful dog but I believe that karma is a b* tch and there is a very "special" place in hell reserved just for whoever did this.|`|RecUV33Daa	This is horrible, I seriously hope that the people who did this to this poor innocent creature get a deserving punishment.

He's most probably a crossbread.|`|6xphiZLSaa	I dont see the pit at all. Its hard to say when they are that young Im a dog groomer and we get that question all the time it will be better to tell when he gets a bit bigger probably around 6 months is when you will see it more. They also have dog dna kits they sell them at Petco I worked there for awhile people bought them all the time. Hope that helps|`|NbPHC39Eaa	I agree with both of the suggestions. I say Lab because of his facial features and Pitt because of the coloring, coat length, and his tail. If you're still not completely sure, take him to the Vet. I know that the Vet my two dogs go to does a test to see what breed of dog you have.|`|EbFXwOgLaa	I would think kind of beagle with a little bit of bit of lab but definately no pitbull. It's a short-haired dog so my answer would beagle/lab mix. Or you can take to the vet or groomers to find out what he is. I hope you find out what breed he is!|`|oHKpy4IRaa	He's a cutie!<br>  Looks like a lab terrier mix.<br>  But, who cares what he's mixed with.

She probably has several breeds in her. Looks like some lab, could possibly be some pit. Cute pup!|`|ydshiNrKaa	I don't see any pit in that cute little face, but the only way to be sure is to have your vet do a dna test.  he really is cute and I'm horrible at determining breeds, it's all a guessing game.

01nMRPHVaa	They will take a variety of prey items, including crickets and other insects, worms (such as waxworms and earthworms - mealworms are probably best avoided due to their tough exoskeleton), and even some small feeder fish such as guppies. Prey should be gut loaded, and dusted with a multivitamin powder. <br>  <br>  These toads generally have good appetites and usually do not have a problem eating in captivity. Adults typically only need to eat 2-3 times a week, and watch that the frogs do not become overweight.<br>  <br>  Here are a few care guides:<br>  <a href="http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/amphibians/fire-belly-toad.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/amphi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Care-for-Fire-Belly-Toads" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Care-for-Fire-Bel...</a>|`|YhCPSYGzaa	Meal Worms.

Nt7exGYAaa	He's obviously refusing to let you get too far away while you sleep and as such is claiming you as his own personal property. <br>  <br>  From the way he treats you when you return from work, he's suffering separation anxiety.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing he gets lots of love and attention when you get home as this will reinforce your bond with him.<br>  <br>  Perhaps easing off on the attention about 15 minutes or so before you go to bed may help too.<br>  <br>  If the weather is getting cooler, that's another reason why he's getting closer to you.<br>  <br>  To break him of this habit give him an article of clothing that's yours and that you've been wearing so your scent is on it.  If he's on your pillow now, try giving him one - again with a pillow slip you've been sleeping on.<br>  <br>  You could try introducing his own personal sleeping cat bed/cushion that's soft by putting it on your lap and getting him to try it out. Also include an article of your clothing so it'll have your scent on it as this will make him feel better.<br>  <br>  If he gets used to this then that in turn can be placed on your bed.<br>  <br>  Each time he wakes you, put him back on his own little bit of space, with a short sharp 'no' - they can usually tell by the tone of your voice. It may take several turns but this works with some cats.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work have you tried just moving over yourself or does he just follow you.<br>  <br>  If nothing seems to be working, visit the vet and get some medication for separation anxiety as this will help calm him down considerably.|`|9ONoBVZYaa	My cats sleep all over me at night.<br>  Is what I do is sleep at the bottom of the pillow and they sleep at the top and I also but another pillow right next to me so they can also sleep on that. I also sleep with my arms above my head in a crown and my cats LOVE that. It is the perfect shape for them.<br>  <br>  I have many cats so I have learned.|`|sdEvcpKwaa	Hmm.. You could try spritzing something in your hair that is citrus-y. Cats and dogs don't like the smell of citrus. That would probably be the most humane way. He just wants to cuddle. If you do it a few nights in a row he will get out of the habit. <br>  <br>  You don't have to squirt lemon in your hair. I am sure you can find a citrus hair product at walmart or something..|`|qGKANnYoaa	get a cage? or you could seperate a part of the room just for him. and yes he just wants to snuggle with somebody. so maybe try wearing a hat or something? try to get him to sleep around your feet or something? or find a cozy bed/tunnel play thing for cats.|`|YDsUZZSgaa	Ha! That sounds like my cat! She likes to decide that around 4am is playtime. She can't understand why I waste the night sleeping, so she creeps up beside me and puts her head two inches from my nose and purrs very loudly (you can hear her across a room) until I wake up. She is a very efficient alarm clock. <br>  Anytime your cat gets on your head, gently pick him up and put him on the floor. He may try to get right back up, but you will need to show him that you are more stubborn than he is. Eventually he should concede the point and go back to just laying on your body. Sweet dreams!|`|zv8QaMe1aa	Say a firm "NO" and move him from your head to where it's okay for him to be, then pet him and tell him this is where he belongs.  Do that a couple of times and then after that when he moves up by your head again say "NO" and put him off the bed..... keep repeating that and he'll figure out that his options are where you want him to be on the bed, or not on the bed at all......may take a few nights, but he'll get it.|`|VebGHrysaa	maybe getting him a cage to keep him in at night|`|NAGiNKFWaa	They did a segment on the early show years ago about how many times a night our pets wake us up.  The irony of the study was that people would rather get up 12 times a night than ban their pets from the bedroom.  My husbands new puppy will sleep over your nose, and when she needs to go potty, she pulls my hair out, not just pulls my hair, but pulls it out.  can you prop some pillows at the head of the bed so he can't sleep there, or get him his own pillow.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	You'll have to get nasty about it.  How is up to you, but he'll keep doing it until he discovers it doesn't pay to sleep on your head.  I say swat him with a newspaper, but be careful to shove him off your head first.
v6L5axHgaa	Another BACKYARD BREEDER aren't we?<br>  <br>  Owners like you contribute more unwanted puppies in this world. <br>  <br>  FIX YOUR DOGS.  NOW.<br>  <br>  Do NOT breed them ever again. How could you leave 8, 5 week old puppies outside? That is so cruel.  You put yourself in this position, and you bred them, now TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITIES and keep them indoors.  They are too young to be outside.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Absolutely not. You should never have bred puppies if you weren't up for dealing with them.|`|PM23RDycaa	during the day is one thing at night they need to be in an enclosed area with heat<br>  <br>  Did it not occur to you to one exercise the pups as well as move their pen so you can clean the carpet? You shouldn't have bred your dogs if you weren't prepared and willing to deal with all that goes along with it including what puppies will do to the carpet. <br>  <br>  If your male seems skittish around them its best not to leave them and him unsupervised for long periods.  <br>  <br>  When you or someone else could not supervise them they should have been crated or penned in an area they they couldn't get out of or do serious damage to. <br>  <br>  Have your dogs spayed after this. In two weeks time they will be ready for their new homes, which hopefully by now have all been lined up, deposits taken and picks made OR pups paid for in full.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	No, that's too cold for them to be out.   It's best not to let the male dog around the puppies, especially if he seems a little afraid of them.  He could react and do them harm.  It's also not unheard of for the female to harm her own pups, if she gets anxious with the male around.   If you can't reinforce the pen they're in, try installing baby gates in a room without carpeting, and that has been puppy-proofed so there's nothing dangerous they could chew.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Absolutely not. Puppies have weak immune systems. They can only be out side for a little while. You should be starting basic training to sit. You should have a breed mentor.

Spay and neuter your other dogs.|`|p5R1GUH1aa	You have to be careful when leaving puos around the male, the quicker the pups are nursed the quicker she goes back into heat. Fathers have been known to kill pups for this reason, I would recomend not to leave the puppies out side for that reasopn as well as their little bodies are not ready for it. Even though they are a hand full remember they are like an infant. It just takes a little to have those playful puppies turn ill. Hope that helps|`|WM7StKDTaa	NO.<br>  not yet, wait until there a few months old if you want to move them outdoors that soon. puppies can get sick easily, you cant leave them outside at night when its 35 and 40 degree's at night.<br>  <br>   i live in California too and we just moved our dog outside and my dog is 6 months old now :)|`|PTxaUkwKaa	I never think it's okay for a dog to sleep outside, whatever the temperature.

Oh yeah, if you keep the adult dogs, GET THEM FIXED.|`|llymfLxQaa	I would highly NOT recommend leaving them outside They do not have all their shots at that age. Get a big opened box and keep them in a  pen and put news paper down.|`|ulhyTxoGaa	are you crazy?  pups that small cannot handle the cold too well, and the mother will not always be there to keep them warm, she has to eat sometime.|`|LYJKOW5Raa	no no no no and NO!!!|`|oNQeg4xWaa	no do not put them outside.i am worried that you would leave them in a pen with the father who is afraid of them,puppies like to play the father could hurt them out of fear.could you invest into a large crate to keep them inside to where they are not running loose while you are sleeping.they are like children they need resposible supervision.they could get into something toxic,or chew on wires,etc.crating them sounds like the safest measure to take and they will be warm and dad won't have to be stressed either.
jyGTlpzTaa	It sounds like your rat is "bruxing"...turn the volume up and listen to this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6-UmBvtIB4&feature=PlayList&p=869752C02B948763&index=0&playnext=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6-UmBvtI...</a><br>  <br>  If it sounds like that its bruxing. He's happy, its a contented noise ;)|`|A2IDiIpIaa	Hey animal lover.<br>  Good job switching to oxbow.<br>  The clicking noise is bruxing, or the chattering of the teeth. It sounds like a clicking / grinding and means they are "Content or happy".<br>  They can also boggle when they are happy. Rats have the ability to push their eyes a wee bit out of the socket and vibrate them to show happiness.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  I do not understand the question? Does your rat not eat. If so just leave it in the cage with no food for one day. They have no option to eat it, which may seem mean but rats know their limits and WILL eat it when they need to.|`|BWez86Ldaa	He's clicking his teeth together, it means he's happy! Congratulations, you make rattie boy very happy :P|`|XUEaEbTjaa	Good for you for switching over to Oxbow!!  I'm very glad to see you researched more on their care and now have them on a high quality food.<br>  <br>  Some rats won't eat the Regal Rat as much as we might wish them to.  Some will simply refuse to eat it at all.  If this is the case and you really have tried, switch over to a high quality lab block such as Harlen Teklad (online only) or Mazuri lab blocks which aren't as good as HT but are better than anything else in stores other than Oxbow.  Also, have you tried Suebee's mix? I use a high quality dog food (senior only) such as Blue Buffalo Senior as the staple food in the diet and they love it. I had to switch to a modified Suebee's myself after one of my five rats refused to eat at all when I had them on Oxbow.<br>  <br>  Some rat owners have had some success introducing Oxbow by soaking it in soy milk and feeding it that way. That seems to get them used to the flavor and at times will help in the transition to the Oxbow as the staple food.<br>  <br>  As for the noises, that is called bruxing. If he's only doing it when he's relaxed either with you or in his cage, this simply means he is quite happy.  You may see this combine with eye boggling which is when his eyes look like they'll pop in and out of his head and this means he is extremely relaxed and happy.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!<br>  =)<br>  <br>  ~Yelliez
CoAc5hS9aa	Right lead; Is when you are traveling clockwise. The inside leg (the one towards the center) should be leading. It will be the right leg for your horse.<br>  <br>  Left lead; Is when you are traveling counter-clockwise. The inside leg (the one towards the center) should be leading. Which will be the left leg of the horse.<br>  <br>  It takes a long time to get used to leads in order to tell which one is proper. Have someone tell you when you are on the proper lead. Eventually you should be able to tell which is which. If your horse in the the proper lead or not.|`|vjC5FVDaaa	It all depends on which direction you are riding in the ring. If you are going clockwise, you tilt your outside leg back(your left) and nudge asking for a right lead, meaning his right front leg(corespondant to your right leg) should be extending the canter. It does get easier, just pay attention to the movements of their shoulders, and eventually it will be second nature. The horses front leg that is to the inside of the ring should always lead the canter, due to balance issues around turns.<br>  <br>  If you notice that your horse has a tendency to pick up the wrong lead in a certain direction, and you still can't tell if it's the right one, ask an onlooker to tell you. I used to even lean over in my saddle to see if the lead was correct.|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	Check that you’re on the correct lead by:<br>  <br>  Keeping your head up, but peak down at his front legs. If you’re on the correct lead, the inside front leg should reach further forward than the outside front leg.<br>  Make a circle. If you’re on the correct lead, the canter will feel balanced. If you’re on the wrong lead, the canter will feel unbalanced.<br>  If you end up of the wrong lead, chances are you didn’t keep your horse bent through his body and flexed at his poll to the inside during the transition. Your horse will pick up whatever lead he’s bent and flexed toward. <br>  <br>  Let’s say you decided to pick up left lead:<br>  <br>   Put your weight on your left seat bone.<br>  <br>   Flex your horse to the left by turning your left wrist as if you’re unlocking a door. That is, start with your thumb as the highest point of the hand, Turn your thumb to the left, and bring your baby finger very close to the withers but don’t cross over the withers. In this moment, your knuckles or fingernails will be pointing up toward your face. Then put your hand back in the original position with your thumb as the highest point of the hand.<br>  <br>  Support with your right rein so your horse doesn’t over bend his neck to the left. His face should be one inch to the inside of a neutral position. (Neutral means his head and neck are straight in front of his body so that his chin is directly in front of his “cleavage”.)<br>  <br>  Your left leg is on the girth to say, “Go forward to the canter.”<br>  <br>  Your right leg is a couple of inches behind the girth because it will signal his right hind leg to strike off into left lead canter. (He has to start cantering with the outside hind leg in order to end up on the correct lead.) <br>  Stay in this “left lead canter” position for a few strides in the walk, and then switch your aids as if asking for right lead canter.<br>  <br>  Long,  but it tells you how.|`|kixQWODVaa	The simplest way to tell what lead(left or right) your on is to look at your legs.  If your going in a left circle and your right leg is in front of your left then you are on the right lead but if your left leg is in front of your right leg then you are on the left lead and in this case the correct lead.<br>  <br>  When your horse is on the right lead he is reaching further with his front right leg and pushing off with his right hind leg and vis-versa.<br>  <br>  hope this helps I tried to keep it simple and not confusing|`|BIshtm7oaa	When you are making a circle to your right your horse should be on the right lead. This means that their right leg on both back and front extends a little further than the other. To do this you slip your outside leg (left) back a bit further than usual and nudge/put pressure to ask for the right lead canter. This is because that engages there left hind leg first, allowing the right leg to extend further. This helps them with their balance when they are traveling in a circle or turning. In other words, clockwise is right lead, (left)outside leg and counterclockwise is left lead, (right)outside leg.<br>  <br>  Is the right lead the lead where to your left is the outside of the ring, and to your right is the inside of the ring? Yes.|`|tFkE4Hv6aa	ok I will try to make this answer as simple as possible haha:) <br>  <br>  <br>  if your trainer asks you to pick up your right lead, this means that the left side of your body will be to the outside, and the OPPOSITE for left lead.<br>  <br>  however, left and right leads are judged on the movement of the horse's legs. <br>  <br>  when on your left lead, your horse's front left should be moving forward first, and when you're on your right lead, your horse's right front should be moving forward first.<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope this answer was helpful!|`|F0oWWCLQaa	right lead-<br>  you're going clockwise (right hand on the inside, same as right rein)<br>  at the canter, if you're on right rein and cantering on the right lead the horses right front leg goes further forwards than the left front leg.<br>  <br>  left lead-<br>  you're going counter-clockwise (left hand on the inside, same as left rein)<br>  at the canter, if you're on left rein and cantering on the left lead the horses left front leg goes further forwards than the right front leg.<br>  <br>  :)|`|pTmrZicfaa	I'm pretty sure (confusing for me too! lol) that as you said, <br>  If your going to the right lead, your right hand will be towards the inside. And left lead - left hand to inside...<br>  I hope I'm right, if not I'm sorry! lol|`|nzeH2MCuaa	YES!! it is. when you are on your right lead canter the right is to the inside and vise versa with the left|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	Right lead: you are turning clockwise and are making a circle going to the right.<br>  Left: you are turning counter clockwise and are making a circle going to the left.<br>  The left leg is on the inside on the left lead<br>  the right leg is on the inside on the right lead|`|wHJucCuVaa	Right lead when you're going right, left lead when you're going left (you know you're going left because all the turns you make in the circular ring will be left turns, vice versa for right)<br>  However, it's a little more complicated than that. If you have a horse that automatically picks up its lead then don't worry about this, however its always good to know weather you're on the correct lead. When you're cantering how you tell whether you are on the correct lead is by looking at the horses front, inside leg. If the front inside leg is reaching forward first, than you're on the correct lead. If the front outside leg is reaching forward first, you're on the wrong lead. This may sound confusing, but like anything you will get the feel for leads. (If you ride English, this is similar to posting. When you post, you post with the outside front leg, cantering is the same accept you want your horse to canter with the inside leg first.)<br>  To get your horse to pick up the correct lead try to bent them slightly to the inside and use your inside leg at the girth and outside leg a few inches behind the girth (a tap will do). If you're riding a really well trained lesson horse your don't have to worry so much about trying to pick up the correct lead, they usually will do it automatically. <br>  I hope this helps. Remember that if you are lessoning your trainer will usually tell you if you are on the wrong lead. <br>  Good luck! :)
8bTder08aa	With specific regard to how your question relates to Arabs, I don't think Arabs are any more aware of what's going on around them than other horses-- I think they are more REACTIVE to what's going on.  <br>  <br>  I've observed this phenomenon when I was riding my Arab in the company of horses of other breeds.  Some environmental stimulus occurs-- say the sound of a car crash on a distant road.  My Arab flings his head up, the white of his eyes showing, nostrils dialated, and I feel his weight shifting from his forequarters to his hindquarters as he's ready to whirl and bolt.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the Quarter Horse we're riding with has lifted his head and his ears are doing the "radar alert" rotation; the Hanoverian has turned his head and flicked his ears and lost interest, and the Standardbred, after a slight pause, is standing patiently completely uninterested.<br>  <br>  My own take on why Arabs are the way they are is that it has nothing to do with the desert environment, because for almost the past 150 years or so, most Arabs have been bred in cooler climate places, like England and Poland and the United States.  I think Arabs are the way they are because most of the ding-bat breeders who propagate them prized this hypersensitivity against all sense and rationality.  And it's perpetuated by show judges and exhibitors who place an out-of-proportion stress on "animation" to the extent that the horses that show "fire" and "animation" at halter and under saddle are placed above those that show calm submission and obedience.<br>  <br>  As long as "fire" and "animation" earn ribbons, Arabs will continue to show flighty behaviors.  If Arabs were judged to the same standard of behavior as, say, Quarter Horses or Warmbloods are, it wouldn't take long to breed the flighty behaviors out of them.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I don't think all horses are created equally in that respect, but I also don't think you can say that all of a certain breed is more "aware" than all of another breed.  Also, just because a horse doesn't react to something in an extreme way doesn't mean he didn't notice it.<br>  <br>  I had one horse who could find her way home from anywhere.  I would ride her off trail, far from home, then turn around and give her the reins and she would always head the most direct way towards home, even if I didn't have the slightest clue where home was (which was a great thing back in the pre-cell phone days).  She was a QH.  I've had other horses who are generally clueless with their sense of direction away from home.|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	All horses naturally have wild horse attributes, i've worked with a few arabians and it's true that they are very alert at all times usually, but so are warm bloods, or any other breed. I think it depends on genetics, and most of all the horse.|`|vjC5FVDaaa	I think all horses are aware. It all depends on how fast acting they are, and if they are bread to be laid back and just not care. Don't mistake lack of interest for lack of awareness.|`|uPsxkspJaa	I know that there was once a study that showed that the finer-built a horse is (like an arab as apposed to a draft) the more inquisitive they are, which results in them tending to have more of an awareness of their environment.  This is because of their small size, they have more of a flight than a fight response,  so if there's anything amiss in their environment they know about it.  However, they tend to be more willing to investigate a new situation than a bigger horse will.|`|TJTshBheaa	I think it depends on the individual horse and possibly the conditions it was born into. I'm thinking something like good v bad feed here. I knew 2 horses both from the same stallion and mare, born a year apart. Gelding was quite tall, stood up really well and all you had to do was clap your hands and he'd bolt around the paddock, head and tail held high. Mare was a lot shorter, barely lifted her head off the ground and wouldn't go faster than a walk. Ridden with a whip she did manage some sort of trot, if you could call it that. Both were bred as polo ponies and were 2 and 3 years old.|`|bkYzIv7jaa	horses are different i have seen a arab as chilled out and a clydey as crazy as!|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I totally agree with what Driver said... "Also, just because a horse doesn't react to something in an extreme way doesn't mean he didn't notice it."<br>  <br>  <br>  I have two horses... a hot Paso Fino, and a laid-back MFT. My Paso Fino reacts in an extreme way, but he's not as observant as my MFT. He'll wait until we're RIGHT in front of something that scares him, and then he'll spook.<br>  <br>  My MFT is extremely calm and laid-back, but VERY aware of her surroundings. Her ears are constantly forward, and she's always looking at everything. But she never spooks.<br>  <br>  <br>  So I don't think you can say a horse is more aware of their surroundings just because they're hot.|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I have a variety of horses and I can say that breeds do differ and so do individuals.   I think it is the breeding for speed and endurance that makes for a "hot temperament".  I have two Icelandic mares, full sisters. They are like night and day.<br>  One is sweet and calm the other is bull headed and reactive.  I think the "hotness" is very individual.  I think that the kind of training that gets a horse to think instead of just reacting is very important.  Horses can and do think, but many aren't given proper training.  Any horse's behavior will be improved with proper behavior based positive training.<br>  <br>  As to the climate where the breeds were developed and temperament, Akel Tike horses are about the "hottest". They live in an area so cold that they are routinely bundled in felt to keep them warm.  It is the breeding for speed, and that can be in the far north or far south as well as at the equator.
VtHvcEtuaa	Sounds like a hot spot which my dog gets all the time!  They are painful for the dogs.  Your vet may give your dog a "lamp shade" to avoid scratching.  If it is a hot spot, what I use is Vitamin E capsules.  We prick the capsule and rub the vitamin E directly on the sore.  Works wonders for the hot spot!

rdcxVqfxaa	If the bird was already tamed, this shouldn't be too difficult. Just give the bird a few days to recover from the incident. He is probably very stressed and frightened by what happened. Be calm and gentle around him, and he'll eventually come around again. Start re-teaching step up, and once you have that down things should be fine. Your friend is very lucky that he got his bird back by the way. Good luck.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Leave the bird in the cage for a while to recover from the fright.  He's had a lot of stress and needs to feel secure in his cage.

It makes me sad but if she is truly dying you should help her go to sleep. We selfishly hold on to those we love at their expense, pain and suffering. Place a plastic bag over her head with little air in it, gently sealed around her neck. She will fall asleep and die painlessly. Keep the bag in place until the heart stops. Get a young one and enjoy another six years.|`|f96ecf10164e7f3a9da36cca8ac9ce14aa	Take her to the vet! It's probably already too late though. Sounds like she has what my mini lop buck had (an inflamed bladder wall). The vet will give you meds (if its curable) and may put liquids under the skin to help hydrate her. If you don't want to prolong her suffering, then just put her down, humanely.<br>  An inflamed bladder wall is something the rabbit can live with, as it only inflames after being aggravated. Unfortunately, my rabbit while on the meds given got better and started being himself again, fell ill to the same thing again about 2 weeks after the meds ended. We tried meds again, and 2 weeks after they ended again he was down again, I had him put to sleep. So, they can live with it, but you just have to watch them and if you can, learn what inflames it. I think my rabbit's case was unique. The vets were confused as to why he kept coming down with it so frequently. According to the vet, most rabbits don't have this problem frequently. All I can say is, if you want to try to save her, then try, but if not, then just have her humanely put down.<br>  <br>  Once a rabbit is done wrong, it may hold a lifetime grudge.|`|Csb3TgPiaa	telephone your local vet for some advice immediately. check her droppings, are they normal for her, i had a similar problem a while back with mine where her she had excess gas, her bowels had slowed down, it could have been very dangerous for her had we not got her treated, i would not do anything right now without talking to a vet, get her seen ASAP, hope shes ok xx|`|XMZaVDjDaa	I am sorry about your rabbit.

ydshiNrKaa	Re homing a dog if it is not going to be getting the attention it needs is a perfect solution for both the dog and the family that owns the dog.

Did she put an add out? Or maybe she could just put up some posters or even talk to some of her friends and see if they can take the dog. Good luck! (your sister is a good person for finding a good new home)|`|Ezcyodycaa	I know how that goes. While the majority of people re-homing pets were just irresponsible in the first place for getting one, sometimes things just come up that no one can control and the better thing for everyone is for the animal to go be with someone else, someone who CAN give the animal what it needs.<br>  <br>  I got my first dog a year and a half ago. I was about to be 19, I had a steady job, money in savings, a spacious apartment and practically in my back yard was a big park with a river and a pond. I got a puppy and I gave her plenty of time and attention. I took her everywhere with me except work until I got a job as a nanny and the family I worked for let me bring my puppy to work so I could socialize her with kids and they could play with her. She was well trained and very happy, and I was stable and everything was going good. But then, right when I'd just put in my 30 day notice to move out of my apartment, because I'd saved up enough money to rent a house and I had a better paying job, both of the parents of the kids I cared for lost their jobs and as a result so did I. The new landlord wouldn't let me sign the lease since I no longer had a job, even though I had enough money to move in and cover me for 3 months. I had no where to live. I still kept trying though. I stayed with my grandpa while I looked for another place. But then all my money was stolen( had it in cash because at the time I didn't have the right ID for a bank account, my birth certificate was on it's way in the mail) and I had no money now. And my grandpa couldn't keep supporting me.<br>  <br>  I had to find a new home for my dog. I t was really hard, but there was nothing I could do.<br>  <br>  But you never know how these things work out. 6 months later I was back on my feet, and I was able to adopt my doggie back from the shelter she went to. Now I live in CA and I will never let her go again. If I'm ever in the same boat again at least it's warm enough out here so I can be a hobo with my dog if it comes down to it. :)<br>  <br>  I would suggest that your sister post ads up online, try to get some in the newspaper, and if she makes it known that she really cares about the dog and where it goes, most shady people will never contact her. Talk to shelters in the area and be honest with them, tell them what's going on. I found the local shelter my dog went to to be very understanding and caring towards the situation. Also even if they don't have room for the pup at the time, they can put ads up in there and people who come to look at the dogs in the shelter will know that there is a puppy available as well. Have her tell everyone she knows to put out feelers for good people who may, at least, have the heart to take them in temporarily. Maybe just find her a temp. foster home and your sister could still be involved with the puppy, like continue to search for a great home for the pup. The more she looks, the opportunities there will be. She will not just be able to find one person who wants the puppy, she'll find a few and be able to choose a good home.<br>  <br>  If you and your sisters heart are in the right place, it'll all work out somehow. Maybe you can help her take care of the puppy in the meantime? And you can do some research, too. Sometimes a good thing to do is just take the puppy out and have her/him meet people, and tell everyone that you are trying to find the perfect home for her/him. Be honest with people. And if you guys choose now that you absolutely will not let the dog go to a bad home, you will find that good people will come up rather than some neglectful person who just wants something that'll be cute for a while, do damage to the dog(physically or mentally, or both), and then dump it off at a pound to get put down. Seriously. It's like if your intent is pure, whether you believe it's God or the "Universe" or whatever making it happen, things will work out.<br>  <br>  I hope your sister does well and I hope you guys can find a great place for the puppy. Stay positive. It will work out.|`|p7swtBYzaa	If she has to do it, she has to do it -- why did she come on here and ask permission from strangers, and why are you complaining about it now.<br>  Nobody said she had to explain her motives to anyone, but if she, or anyone else, asks a question on here, they need to be prepared to hear answers they don't want to hear.<br>  <br>  Your sister had the dog for a short time, maybe she didn't know she was ill, but a "debilitatint illness" does not normally happen overnight and she certainly had 3 school age children for more than a few months.<br>  Sorry, but it is hard to understand what your complain is --- I feel sorry for the dog who is uprooted.   <br>  Too many times people get dogs on the spur of the moment, then when they realize the time, work, and expense involved they find some reason to dump it "for its own good" --- most of the time that is just a cop out for what they want to do to be rid of it.|`|JeJP98Vnaa	I applaud your sister for being a responsible pet owner by even taking the time to find a suitable new home for the puppy and not just dropping it off at a shelter where it might not be adopted or abandoning it. Don't listen to those who post rude answers, they often can't or won't put themselves in another's position and to them only their opinion matters. Good luck to your sister. There are many lab rescue groups that would be sympathetic and understanding to the situation, and are very good at selecting proper homes for pets.|`|uVwsrqOraa	Re-homing a dog is perfectly acceptable as far as I'm concerned. Your sister is thinking about the dog, nobody wants their dog to be crated for hours on end. I believe to re-home is much better than going to a pound where the dog is lonely and scared. In a home, he/she adjusts and loves the security and the family. Your sister is making the right choice.|`|CJMhtM7maa	Please apologize to your sister for the rudeness of some people on this site.WE ARE NOT ALL LIKE THEM.A lot of people do not read the whole question,or just retain what they want to read.It is a shame she has to re home the pup but medical problems and young children have to take priority.Try a pet rescue group,they are all over crowded but they will try to help.Good Luck|`|7RGoazmaaa	Yes sometimes it is absolutely justified. She had no idea what was coming when she adopted the puppy. I think people actually need to take the time to read the details first, it's so rude when someone doesn't get the chance to explain.|`|Hjny2ducaa	Because a lot of dog people are just snotty know-it-all's and are to quick to judge people. I am sorry certin people were horrible to your sister i hope she has more good days then bad|`|7RUoBhV4aa	Because people are ridiculous!  Every one like to be right and most think the best way to be right is to act superior and flawless. As for the best way to re-home a puppy either take out an add in a local paper or take it to a local shelter. Most shelters will ask for a small donation (usually whatever you can afford). The best thing about taking animals to a shelter is that there is (although not much) screening to insure that an animal is going to a good home. That way your sister can think about her health rather then if her puppy is ok. Ignore ignorant people. Anyone who was mean and judgmental obviously have nothing to offer others then a crappy personality.<br>  <br>  Also kudos to your sister for knowing her limitations and doing what was in the best intrest of her four legged friend!!!|`|CLVt48b3aa	there are alot of people who like to answer questions on this site that have not a clue about anything and chances are they have no control over anything in their lives and it makes them feel important to put someone else down.. i am so sorry to hear about your sister, my thoughts and prayers are with her and her family..  as far as her having to give the family pet up, well, its never easy, but u can try the local news paper, or if u know a family member or friend that would be able to care for it, that would be good also....  there are lab rescues and they specialize in things like this... again, i m sorry for ur sister....|`|XoknFyNvaa	I agree with that circumstance as it is uncontrollable and she just found out. <br>  <br>  However, I do have a problem with people that get a dog 1 month after they have a child and then discover that they can't handle both. These people don't think about how their actions reflect on society on more importantly the dog. <br>  <br>  I assume that your sister thought about the decision to get a puppy and only due to this unforeseen medical issue, has to re-home the dog. There is nothing wrong with that and I hope that she gets healthy soon. When she does get better, she may want to consider adopting an older dog that will support her through her recovery. Best of luck to you and your family.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD: as for an answer to her question. Try Kijiji.com or a local newspaper. Make sure she interviews the potential adopters so that she can be happy with her decision. If she is unable to find a good home, find a rescue organization that will screen each applicant.
0mb78CiWaa	Neutering cats usually calms them down. He is constantly meowing because he is trying to attract a mate.

My 5 yr old neutered male cat sounds the same way. He's always talking!<br>  But I would get him neutered anyway. In case he gets out of the house (if he's an indoor cat) he might make more kitties who end up homeless =(<br>  But neutering might also help the peeing problem... I've had my guy for a few months, so I don't know much about kittens but I've heard it helps.<br>  Good luck!|`|p5R1GUH1aa	YES neuter him ASAP, the pee problem will just get worse, that will be the worst smell ever, he will try to escape so be careful when the door opens, nature is calling him to manhood. There are usually low cost cat neuter clinics every where, really get him to a vet ASAP  Good Luck|`|WhcPr1yraa	He will probably still meow after he is neutered--some cats are very vocal. However, neuter him before the peeing problem gets worse!|`|uBFhKXgHaa	I think it's time to get /both/ of you boy cats neutered! <br>  <br>  Fixing your male has a lot of benefits as well as ensuring that they won't add to the pet overpopulation. Neutering males eliminates all chances of testicular cancer as well as having behavioral benefits (reduces the urge to escape and roam in search of a mate, cuts down on aggression, and if done before the animal begins spraying/marking upon reaching sexual maturity, they may well never spray/mark at all!)

wroKe9SBaa	They are ok, be patient.  Sometimes, water quality and temperature effects birth dates.  From your description, I'd say they are due soon!|`|asXq2cFDaa	That is correct, 1 month.<br>  If fish are stressed(Probably just from the move, nothing you can do.) they can hold the babies inside of them for longer. I have heard of a molly keeping babies inside of her for 3 months!|`|JdcNTholaa	well one female guppy can hold her babys in for a long time so you will just have to wait and see what happends

Please , please take him back to the vet . . Good luck and God Bless , I will pray for him .|`|OCMSTxYfaa	doesn't sound like the antibiotics are strong enough...call the vet and ask them..maybe they can give you something else without having to pay for another office visit...if it doesn't sound right..it probably isn't|`|ISPIa0n5aa	maybe you should ask the vet...|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Any infection in urinary blockages is not all that common.  Vets still give antibiotics and there is nothing wrong with that I guess.  It's not liable to have much effect on the problem.<br>  <br>  Dietary changes are the proper treatment.  They add methionine to the s/d food (which is a poor quality food) to acidify the urine and prevent the crystals.<br>  <br>  Cats that eat meat don't get crystals in their urine (or have hairballs).  That's what they are meant to eat, the grains in dry food make the urine alkaline and cause the problem.|`|AA12338473	This happened to my 3 year old male and by the time they did the catheter (sp?), it was too late, the blockage had gone to the point of needing surgery [removing his entire genitalia]. Please don't let it get to this point! Our Fuzz was in antibiotics for about a week before it became entirely blocked and stopped peeing altogether. At first, he was urinating very small quantities, his litter would have a very strong odor and he would drink more water than usual. By the end of the week after antibiotics, he started peeing blood, crying and howling.<br>  <br>  I don't want to scare you, but glad you made another appointment. We had to put down our Fuzz and it was by far one of the worst experiences I've endured because we simply couldn't afford the 2k+ surgery. I hope your cat is insured, when it has progressed this fast, the bills can add up really fast. I just finished paying off for his cremation and his vet bills, and this happened last August. Good Luck.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	I had a cat that died of that. you need to get him to the vet so he can get a catheter put in. If he doesn't pee then he will get kidney damage.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Not every antibiotic works for every cat (or human).  He might need something different or something stronger.  You will know when your cat is better, and you really should follow your instincts.  Take him back to the vet and look at some other options for a cure.
wrUsMG4Jaa	It is a very serious incident, the police should have been called.<br>  <br>  Dogs have a serious amount of bacteria in their mouths which can cause infections far worse than rabies. You should go to the doctor and have your wound flushed and cleaned properly.<br>  <br>  The police should be notified of the bite so the animal can then go on record as having bitten. Just because YOUR bite wasn't bad, doesn't mean the next one won't be.<br>  <br>  I had a similar experience last December, in which if just ONE person had reported a dangerous dog, I could have saved three trips to the hospital, and saved 40 thousand dollars in medical expenses for myself and my dog. <br>  <br>  Report it. Next time it may be a child.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  It's probably the best-known of all animal diseases and--luckily for dog owners--now among the most rare in the Western world. But rabies is still a deadly and highly contagious disease, and it's only held in check by careful health practices, an aggressive vaccination program, and quick action when a case crosses over from the wild animal population to pets.<br>  here's more info:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/rabies.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/rabies.html</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|BNKBs4Peaa	Depends the type of bite. What it playful, nippy, or attacking? Playful can sometimes be okay, but you shouldn't let the dog do this anyways. No, the bite just need some anti-bacterial spray, and maybe some medicine to rub on it and a band-aid. Thats all!|`|pvgwJwxvaa	any puncture wound can cause a problem and with a bite bacteria has been introduced.  you need a tetanus booster and possibly antibiotics as well as filing a police report.|`|QJsyw1EVaa	Since I live in a country without rabies I am unsure on the protocol, you still should be wary of infection. When was your last tetanus shot? They are recommended every 10 years, if you don't have a record or can't remember it is best to get a booster done anyways. Puncture wounds provides the bacteria with an ideal breeding ground.<br>  <br>  As a Veterinary Nurse I have had my fair share of dog bites. I scrub out all dog bites with Betadine. Sterile scrub brush and Betadine and just go hard! I get my Tetanus shot done every 5 years due to the nature of my work. I have gone to the doctor and gotten courses of antibiotics for some of the deeper bites or when the dogs have had dental disease.|`|tc0leGYTaa	depends if it was playing nipping or a real bite bite.<br>  ya i think you should be fine. just band aids keep eye on it if it swells pink around it, it might be infected and you don't want that, so just put neosporn and as band aid. don't forget to wash it to.|`|p5R1GUH1aa	you really need to make an accident report either with the police or local animal shelter. Dog bites are horrible, remember where their mouth has been...every where, the owner of the dog should pay your dr bills as well as any treatment needed|`|LdNtOUWeaa	no it is not serious then... you may still get an infection so keep an eye on it. as long as the dog is up to date on shots you will be okay!!|`|8MuDruTlaa	I think it'll be okay if it's not need and you dont feel pain. If it gets infected or swollen, I would go to the doctor.|`|RSoSr9Vtaa	Nope|`|zTj6bnIlaa	you should be fine, a dog's saliva is considered a natural antiseptic. A dog bite is very painful, so well done for not calling the police and getting the dog in trouble when his owner should have had him under control. A lot of dalmatians are deaf , so maybe this is why his owner couldn't call him off.<br>  In the unlikely event that you see a red / itchy mark moving from the bite up along the vein in your arm, then it has got infected and you need an antibiotic.|`|ydshiNrKaa	You can, but you should make sure you completely washed and cleaned the wound.  Dogs mouths contain a lot of bacteria, and if you have not cleaned the wound completely, you will get an infection and possible other problems.  I would go to an emergency room and get some antibiotics to be on the safe side.  it's worth the trip and cost to prevent further problems down the line from in improperly cleaned dog bite.

AA12322387	I personally wouldn't concern myself with the laser.  But I would ALWAYS get blood work.  I used to work at a vet and sent many animals home rather than going ahead with surgery because blood work came back bad.  <br>  <br>  It's very important to ensure that vital organs are functioning properly before anesthesia.  I would never consider putting a pet under without it.<br>  <br>  And pain meds...I can't believe you even have that option..that shouldn't even BE an option...geeze...that should be a given.|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	Feline castration is a straight forward surgery.<br>  If your cat was being spayed I would recommend the laser as it is an abdominal incision.<br>  I don't think its necessary for a male<br>  But having the option is good and the price is reasonable.<br>  <br>  Pre anesthetic blood work is essential.<br>  Just like pain management it should not be optional.<br>  It illustrates if the cat has an underlying infection and that the animal will be able to metabolize the drugs.<br>  Ideally this should be done the day before or just prior to surgery.<br>  <br>  Pain management is wonderful.<br>  Im just relieved its offered.<br>  Ask what type of pain medication is dispensed.<br>  For that price it must be a one time dose.<br>  Likely it is ketofen or bupernex.<br>  If it is metacam it is critical that pre anesthetic blood work is done to check the integrity of the kidneys.<br>  <br>  Just so you know the laser is said to be superior and less painful than the traditional scalple blade.<br>  Its upside is that there is less bleeding and trauma.<br>  In a feline castration bleeding is minimal so its not necessary.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your boy!|`|AA12308199	I would call an animal shelter and see if they have any low cost options.  The ones around where I live do and they are a lot lower cost than that.|`|AA11540024	visit your local humane society for a spay/neuter coupon and get the pain meds when you get it done.|`|p5R1GUH1aa	all of that is cheap, think about if it were you, pain meds a must,|`|0mb78CiWaa	I got my cat from the shelter she was already spayed. They did it the basic way. If the laser is the least painful that is the one I would get. <br>  <br>  It is usually cheaper to get your cat neutered/spayed at your local animal shelter.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Get the blood work and the pain meds. The laser isn't necessary. The blood work sounds if your cat's having any problems that might complicate the surgery and is a good basis for your cat's health.

KEYgd73saa	The only immediate "cure" is a series of water changes.  While water changes will slow the colonization of bacteria that will keep ammonia and nitrites converted to nitrate, it won't much matter if current nitrite spikes kill all the fish.  Do as many water changes as you need to get the readings at no more than .5 ppm (even this is dangerous).  Keep the water well-oxygenated, and if you've got any, putting some methylene blue in the water or a bit of salt (as in a teaspoon per 50 gallons), will both reverse the effects of nitrite poisoning, methylene blue by oxidizing methemoglobin (the result of nitrite poisoning) back to hemoglobin, the salt by allowing the fish to selectively take in chloride anions rather than nitrite anions.<br>  <br>  As has been pointed out, the first answer was regarding nitrates, not nitrites.|`|ImC4V2hcaa	um kristina... he is talking about nitrites with an "i" not nitrates with an "a"|`|6yoCcGBWaa	Are you certain that you have high nitrites and not high nitrates?<br>  <br>  Nitrites are reduced to zero when a new tank is fully cycled.  Check your nitrite (or nitrates, if that's the problem) level in your replacement water.  If your replacement water shows any sign of nitrites or nitrates, you need a different water source.  This may mean you need to use bottled water - not distilled, but spring or RO.<br>  <br>  Frequent water changes can slow down the colonization of the beneficial bacteria that convert the nitrites into nitrates.|`|sdEvcpKwaa	How to Reduce Nitrates<br>  Unlike ammonia and nitrites, the bacteria that remove nitrates do not like oxygen rich environments. Therefore, conventional filters do not harbor the bacteria that remove nitrates. Although special filters exist that will remove nitrates, such devices are usually expensive compared to other filtration units. However, there are some steps you can take to keep nitrates low.<br>  Keep the tank clean – Waste ultimately produces nitrates. Cleaner tanks produce fewer nitrates in the first place.<br>  <br>  Don’t overfeed the fish – Overfeeding is a significant contributor to excess nitrates and other undesirable wastes, such as phosphates.<br>  <br>  Water changes – Performing regular water changes with water that has little or no nitrates will lower the overall nitrate level in the tank. RO/DI water is an excellent choice for keeping nitrate levels low.<br>  <br>  Keep live plants – Live plants utilize nitrates, and will help keep nitrates in check.<br>  <br>  Use nitrogen removing filter media – Instead of an expensive denitrator or special filter, use special media in the filter you have. Although they will not lower nitrates dramatically, if used together with other methods the net result will be beneficial.|`|uqag7LEDaa	Water changes won't make any difference if your tank hasn't cycled. <br>  Yes it will reduce the Nitrites somewhat but your starting the cycling process over and over. If you know somebody with an established tank ask them to squeeze a sponge in a bag with some of the tank water. If you don't know anybody go to a local Pet Shop and ask them if they could do it or give you some media. This will instant cycle your tank.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
JEaTBC8Vaa	That should be fine but as stated before you need Brackish water. This is  half salt and half freshwater. It isn't really that hard to make. Marine salt should be fine. I used that for my fiddler crab tank which needed brackish water.<br>  <br>  <br>  ******************GOOD LUCK****************<br>  <br>  Edit: It is not a saltwater fish!!!!<br>  Don't believe that idiot that said that you need saltwater. Figure 8's are brackish. And you can fit all of the brackish supplies in a 10 gallon tank.|`|8EtKbKzjaa	Its called "brackish water" not difficult to do but you will need sea salt. Not sure if you can use marine salt ive only known sea salt.|`|iH4HMQEkaa	Puffer fish is a salt water fish, and a salt water tank requires a lot of things to keep the water in a suitable condition. For instance live cultures, sea salt ( not table salt ), and live rocks and plants. Salt water aquariums are for people who are very experienced with live fish. Also all of this stuff will not fit into a 10 gallon aquarium and still leave room for a 3" fish... that's a much bigger fish than you think, especially if it's a puffer.|`|wroKe9SBaa	.... I would REALLY recommend against it, as they can grow quite big.  Instead, why not try some Dwarf Pufferfish??? They have the same personality as Fig 8 Puffers, and grows to a max of 2-3 cm!!! So you can easily keep 7-8 in your tank! And not to mention that THEY ARE COMPLETELY FRESHWATER!!! No salt whatsoever is required!!!
tsjLHXzUaa	Yes, I suppose.  Its not okay for trees to eat cats, though.  If that ever happens to you, you should report it.  Trees are pretty decent most of the time, but I have had a few run-ins.<br>  <br>  My cat wont eat anything besides dry cat food.  The more generic the better.  She wont eat the fancy stuff. And she wont eat human food or any of the foods cats are supposed to like.|`|u7vrul2Faa	Most cats would not swallow the limbs but simply chew on them.<br>   <br>  The worse that could happen is that a cat could get splinters from chewing on them and for any cats that do eat them it could be a choking hazard or the sharp pieces could cause injury to the internal organs eg the windpipe or stomach.|`|0mb78CiWaa	It should not harm them. They probably are eating it because it adds fiber to their diet. Cats also like to eat plants like catnip or cat grass. It is healthy for them and gives them some needed nutrients.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Perfectly alright.  I once had two cats that devoured a twenty foot larch in less than 30 days.|`|be1979ce40b9ceceab7ad137e21ac660aa	Some plants are poisonous to cats. But I don't know about tree limbs.|`|qGKANnYoaa	thats awkward..<br>  i dont think its good for them though|`|9ONoBVZYaa	Well, I haven't seen my cats do that...But that might be because I don't let them outside by the highyway. But I a pretty sure that it is in their nature to do that.<br>  Reason: Because they need to sharpen their teeth and tear things up, sorta like their claws.<br>  Also they might do that is they have pain in a tooth or baby teeth.

xPxm8ONiaa	Dogs don't hump objects and people because they want to have sex with them... most people think it is the reason but its not. Dogs are smart animals, i think they know the difference between a female dog and a pillow....<br>  anyway, your dog could be trying to dominate the pillow. Or he could just have A LOT of energy that he needs to get rid of... he looks like a yorkie, or yorkie mix. Terriers are really energetic dogs, and are known to be even more aggressive than wolves. Try to exercise him more, and don't let him use the pillow too much :)<br>  <br>  btw, he is adorable :)|`|B3TDjhCeaa	it might just be a giant zit, go check it out with a vet, but it sounds like a zit to me.|`|qNPGLOQbaa	first off- YOUR DOG IS ADORABLE!<br>  and umm ya don't think that's normal i would go see a vet.|`|aeXmMKRfaa	well if you got your balls cut off wouldnt you still wants to have sex?|`|fskCvWWiaa	I have a friend with a FEMALE dog who does it with a stuffed Barney the dinosaur.

HFKr2vBsaa	I had some baby chicks a few times at Easter when I was a kid and was told the same thing.  It's probably a mixture of the more little kids hold em the greater the chance for damaging the delicate little things and perhaps they suffer motion sickness or something.<br>  <br>  I've not ever heard anything from anyone who actually knew so it will be interesting if you get someone with knowledge in animal husbandry to fill us in. Good question!|`|rQlzfHqraa	Children and baby birds don't make a good mix. Birds will squirm and little hands could squeeze too much. Allow them to pet the poults while you hold them and then let them grow older before any more contact. As an adult I always played with my poults but I was the only one that could be bringing harmful germs. The squeezing and the germs are the concerns.|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	How else will you get them in the oven if you don't handle them? Just kidding, yeah you can make them sick.

0ZfZulnzaa	I worked in a vet clinic for years and we would dose them with pain meds after the surgery, but when they went home rarely did they require anymore. When I have had my female cats spayed I did not give them any meds either at home, the first day or so they were a little drowsy and not wanting to do that much(eliminating the anesthesia from their system) But after that they were pretty much back to normal, just had to make sure they did not over do it with the jumping.<br>  <br>  If she is not in pain or any discomfort I would not give it to her, but is she seems to be painful it would be a good idea to give her some.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I've had many, many cats spayed/neutered and I've never used pain meds with any of them.  If she seems to be ok without it, I wouldn't give it to her.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Might be best to phone your vet if worried, by my none-vet feeling is don't. Pain has a function: it's to let us know something is wrong and to be careful of the bit that's hurting.  It might seem harsh, but if she's jumping all over and there's a danger of her busting her stiches, then a little bit of discomfort might be good.  Of course, if she seems in pain you should give her them... I wouldn't want to see a cat in pain, just not drugged up and not realising she has bits that are healing and she needs to be careful about.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	That is really a question for a vet, not those of us who aren't trained in vet care.  Please call your vet - you will get the best answer that way.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Yes its best to listen to the vets advice,in case her pain returns.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	Doctors are right most of the time so, yes, I would :)|`|MyjgtGotaa	Do not stop her medication. That's the worst thing you can do. Whether you think kitty needs it or not is not up to you, it's up to your vet. 3 more days of pain medication is not going to hurt her, in fact it may be the reason for her sudden change in activity.

Does she like people? Does she like to interact with other dogs? If she does then the Pet Motel will be perfect as she gets to socialize, gets attention and gets some playmates. If she has trouble being put into a strange situation then staying at home where it's familiar and comfortable and having someone familiar come by and babysit or check on her is another solution.<br>  <br>  If you trust the Motel, feel that your doggie can handle 7 days of a new environment with ease and will have a good time then go with the Motel. If you feel that she won't like the motel because she hasn't been receptive to new people then have a petsitter come to your home (a close friend, a family member). <br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)

My dog loves cat food and I asked my vet if it was bad for him.  She said no, the reason dogs love cat food so much is because it has more fat in it so it is more flavorful.  So that might help - ask your vet if they have any suggestions!  If he has something mixed with him it might be normal for that breed to be a bit skinnier!|`|b4NcFBhraa	Feed him more food at feeding times. Or try a different, more healthful, food. Maybe feed him more times in a day. He may have worms, check his poop after ever dooky for about a week. If you don't see or do see anything, I'd take him to the vet for meds.

Try making him meals comprised of some meat and rice, no spices, and see if he likes those (feed him twice a day). If he isn't into that, just keep trying out new stuff, like buy different dog food or give him cheese or what not. Just see what works for him.|`|RehgySLCaa	you could pour bacon grease on the dogs food|`|clnvOmaEaa	feed him catfood|`|0fe94fd7d5db6bc0416b695f26217eeaaa	There are a few things you can do, feeding him cat food is not one of them. Cat food is not formulated to dogs, it's formulated to cats and can cause problems with dogs.<br>  <br>  Putting him on a mixed diet of puppy food and adult food can help him bulk up a bit. Puppy food is designed to help the puppies put on weight as they grow. It's also used when breeding dogs so that the female can put on enough weight to handle a litter of puppies.<br>  <br>  You could add wet food to the diet. Wet food adds moisture content to the food as well as more calories. The caloric intake is a bit higher with wet food than with dry, which is good. Mixing dry and wet food will add moisture content and caloric content which will make the food more appealing.<br>  <br>  Some kinds of wet food that have a lot of nutrients in it are anything with Tripe in it. Tripe is the entrails of animals, and these entrails have a ton of nutrients in them that will give your animal a nicely rounded out diet. It stinks like hell, but it is very healthy for them. You can get green bean tripe, carrot tripe, any kind of tripe.<br>  <br>  Always remember that your dog is an omnivore. All dogs are omnivores. So ensuring that your dog has a nicely rounded out diet will keep you reassured that your dog is getting all the nutrients he needs which would make the fact that he might be a little underweight not a big deal.<br>  <br>  It's always better to be a little underweight than a little overweight.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Check out the links I've attached so you can do your own research on the different kinds of foods out there. Focus around the 6 star and 5 star foods. Also check out the body condition score chart so you can get an idea if your dog is underweight or just the right weight! :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!! Brussels Griffons are soooo cute!! :)

I've found that if I sit down with the person and tell her "it's ok" she is less anxious. It's harder with Shepherd's because they are naturally protective and EXCELLENT judges of character. Before my husband and I went on vacation, we had the person who was going to take of her come over a couple nights ahead of time and feed her. There was no problems with that person after that, but I don't want her to become friendly with all strangers. That would defeat the purpose of owning a GS if she wasn't my family's protector! Good luck with your boy!|`|BNKBs4Peaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I have a dog that does the same thing as yours. Okay here is what to do. When your dog sees someone and begins barking, grasp your hands around his snoot (nose & mouth area) and in a stern voice say "No!" and then let go. Everytime you see your dog barking repeat this action. It should work within a couple of days, but if it doesn't that's all i know!|`|788sif5baa	I also would recommend to go to a good dogs trainings course. <br>  <br>  The thing with the noise making can someone already suggested: don′t do it!

Good luck!|`|sTXN70eWaa	You need to get a behaviorist.<br>  And till then keep the crate somewhere where neither dogs can get to untill you have to use it.<br>  This should have been dealt with the first time it happened.|`|3swTodhhaa	Unless the dog is violent against other dogs... it is not dog aggression.  Huskies are known for their prey drive.  A Boston Terrier is a small dog.  To be honest that is what it sounds like to me especially since you say the dog is chasing cats.  You can get a dog behaviorist to try and help you but I wouldn't leave them alone together.  <br>  <br>  Most huskies are still puppies until at least 3 years old.  They also need exercise or they will become even more destructive.  <br>  <br>  My best advise is invest in a book called Siberian Huskies for Dummies and read it from front to back a couple of times.  Then you might have an idea about your dog.  Huskies are not for the average dog owner.   Not to say you shouldn't have the dog... but you need to learn quite a bit more about them.
rTSwouqXaa	When I started reining I just rode my old roping saddle. And to answer the second part of your question. A Roping saddle is a real Western Saddle...that's what the horn is for...it was never there for you to hang on to its to dally a rope around. It doesn't matter what saddle you ride in especially when starting out.

For males, this is about they time they reach 4 inches in length (about 2-5 years old).<br>  <br>  Females are sexually mature when they reach 6-7 inches in length (may take 5-7 years).<br>  <br>  Male red eared sliders have much longer claws on their front feet than females. As well, the tail of males is longer and thicker.<br>  <br>  The cloaca is located farther from the body in males, and males also may have a slightly concave (curved inward) plastron. <br>  <br>  Here are a few care guides:<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilesturtles/a/reslidercare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilest...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/caresheet-red_ear_slider.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/ca...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/turtles/red-ear-slider.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/turtl...</a>|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	In theory, you can.

5TM9P8tsaa	*You do not bathe rabbits. He probably got chilled and caught pneumonia. Rabbits do not need veggies that much as it will cause ISS and kill them. Hay but not alfalfa hay. Need a tree branch to wear down their teeth. Annual vet.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	First off, let me say I am so sorry for the loss of your Rabbit. :(<br>  <br>  Experts disagree about bathing or not bathing, As long as you made sure he didn't get chilled after bathing, I see no real harm. It is possible he had an internal injury from falling, but since you monitored him for a week and if he acted naturally, ate as usual, had bowel movements (if you can call rabbits pellets bowel movements.....I guess so.) Umm did you allow him to eat some of his poo? Rabbits need to do that. They pass two kinds and one is what they need to eat. The one they need is called cecotropes  and they usually eat them as they come out of the rabbit. If a rabbit doesn't get the cecotropes they can die of malnutrition. I can't imagine that you kept it's cage or pen completely free from his pellets......<br>  Did he die over a period of time (like you noticed him acting differently or sluggish or labored breathing and lying on it's side?) or quickly?<br>  <br>  You know all creatures aren't born perfect, and some die young and some live to a ripe old age.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't beat myself up and second guess myself if I were you. It seems like you loved and cared for the rabbit as best you knew how and sought professional help in feeding and caring for it.<br>  <br>  It is a hard thing to lose a beloved pet and we all naturally try and think what we could have done to have  help or hindered them.  I'd say allow yourself to grieve, but remember you loved and cared for it and gave it a better life than most rabbits ever have.<br>  <br>   The only other option you would have had was vet doing a Necropsy (autopsy) and the vet may have turned up nothing or a physical flaw etc etc.<br>  <br>  Again, let go, and remember the best of times you had with the rabbit.|`|roOgfjQoaa	thank you for giving all the info... I just had to sign on and answer this.<br>  <br>  Not feeding him veggies for a week will not kill him.<br>  <br>  out of the whole story you gave, the most likely thing that would have killed him was the bath. You are not supposed to give rabbits baths, they can get hypothermia and can go into shock. also if you do give them a bath it should be a "dry bath" using same thing as chinchillas use dry bath powder. I hope you didnt use human shampoo or soap, as rabbits skin is really sensitive and that may have killed him as well.
024lJBZ4aa	I seriously suggest you find a good class and attend.  It's really important that your dog learns how to manuver the equipment in a safe manners.  <br>  <br>  You can't just take a dog who hasn't been exposed to  the equipment before and put them on, it's just not that easy.  <br>  <br>  Before you start building any equipment, you and your dog will need to learn flatwork, ie:  running along side you, front crosses, rear crosses, lead outs, lead out pivots, blind crosses, back/flip, left/right etc.  You can find a Introduction to Foundation work DVD on the CleanRun website.  <br>  <br>  Please check the CleanRun websiite <a href="http://www.cleanrun.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cleanrun.com</a> to find a local agility training class.  Also check the below websites to find a local agility club.<br>  nadac.com<br>  usdaa.com<br>  cpek9.com<br>  akc.org<br>  <br>  (even though  you own a mixbreed dog, you can still train at an AKC obedience/agility training club)  <br>  <br>  <br>  I've been involved in agility since 1997.   I ran in beagle mix in NADAC & ASCA to Elite titles and earned her UACH with the UKC.  I currently run a Standard Dachshund (wirehair) in AKC, USDAA & NADAC.  He's got his Elite NADAC titles, AKC open level titles, USDAA P1 titles working on P2.  I have another young Standard Dachshund (wire) who will begin training soon.  I am also currently training and running my friends' dog, another Standard Wire Dachshund.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	Wyrdachs is correct. If you are actually contemplating training for competition you must realize, you can not train something you do not know about.<br>  <br>  There are rules in agility competition: how various obstacles must be executed correctly. There are correct jump heights each particular dog must jump: and they vary between different agility organizations.<br>  <br>  Some of the specs of equipment varies too between organizations.<br>  <br>  There are "best ways" and different methods to train a dog. Training is a step by step process.<br>  <br>  Often, if not trained carefully (obstacles are started low) a dog can become afraid of obstacles, particularly the teeter and it can take over a year to fix it.<br>  <br>  Training a dog is fairly simple. But if one is incorrect in what exactly they trained the dog to do, it is very, very difficult to "untrain" and "retrain".<br>  <br>  The most difficult part of being "competition ready" is as much the handler understanding his job as the "navigator", as the dog being trained on the equipment. Knowing how to clearly direct you dog on his path through the obstacle course...as well as truly understaning what the dog's path actually is.<br>  <br>  Agility starts with "groundwork" before training the equipment.<br>  <br>  Find a trainer for guidance.<br>  <br>  Highly recommend going to local trials to watch and learn! Find out what agility really is all about. You can ask for local trainers too.<br>  <br>  search the www:<br>  <br>  www.cleanrun.com  for clubs and trainers<br>  <br>  for rules, and trial locations and dates:<br>  <br>  www.akc.org<br>  www.k9cpe.com<br>  www.usdaa.com<br>  www.nadac.com|`|6SeWCfUfaa	There's a lot to learn about agility and about safely training agility.  Your dog can get seriously hurt trying to learn these things if you don't know what you're doing and do it safely.  <br>  <br>  If you don't have time to drive to classes, find classes that are closer or get your dog involved in something that is closer.

The one I used was like a powder you put on first leave it for twenty four hours to absorb the smell then you use the liquid to clean it , it worked for me.

Let the customer service person know that you need to clean dog urine. The Live Enzymes eat the bacteria causing the smell.<br>  <br>  If they have The Cure, lift your carpet, clean the floor and dry it and then sprinkle liberally on floor, then pull padding over floor and sprinkle on padding and then last pull carpet back into place and sprinkle on carpet.  LIBERALLY. Let it stand for at least 24 hours (the cure is the best in powder form as it is what the Police Departments use when Dead Bodies have been left in homes decaying- gross I know, but that is how good it is)<br>  <br>  If you can't lift your carpet, it is probably going to be really tough because the urine is probably in your foam padding and maybe even below that on the floor.

sLWeIrY9aa	You can get specially formulated hedgehog food but many people agree the cat food formulated for urinary tract health supplemented with some protein or iron source like meal worms works well.<br>  <br>  For bedding, stay away from cat litter or cedar shavings the best kind in my experience is the kind of bedding made from newspaper.<br>  <br>  The larger the cage the better with no large openings they can get their head stuck in. Also let them run free often they move around a lot in the wild.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	You should NOT get a hedgehog until you know all about them! A spacious cage is necessary. I believe martinscages.com has hedgehog specific cages. I don't believe you need to get special water for them. I suggest finding a good hedgehog book and read it. Google exactly what to feed them, but I do know they like mealworms.
n4pNNcGfaa	You can spot clean her the same day with damp towels.  If she has the kind of coat that will dry quickly you can give her a full bath in warm water.  You don't want to put her back in with the pups wet because it may chill them.  So be sure you can get her completely dry quickly.  The key is to not keep her from her pups for very long and not use anything on her coat that wouldn't be safe to lick (because the pups will be suckling on her).  So use a very mild shampoo without flea medication in it.  <br>  <br>  She's going to need to go out every few hours to potty.  If her potty area is where other dogs (outside your household) also toilet, it would be wise to wash her feet before putting her back with her pups so she doesn't track in anything like Parvo.  If you have a private fenced yard it shouldn't be necessary to wash her feet.|`|IcfoAI3naa	I wait till the pup are three weeks old, it wouldn't do any good to do it any earlier because mom is still bleeding pretty much.

zt8iGuzVaa	probably the same way a liger exists, it is a mix of two animals that are close enough together to produce a live offspring, but not close enough that the offspring can reproduce,|`|PM23RDycaa	There is no such thing as a teacup. your cousin wanted to but a badly bred runt labeled as a teacup or just someone trying pass off a tiny pup as a "teacup"<br>  <br>  The chihuahua breed standard calls for a dog no larger than 6 pounds. That's its. There are no size classes amongst this breed.<br>  <br>  Regardless of breed a small breed female dog under 4-5lbs should not be bred as odds are she will die from complications due to pregnancy or be unable to carry a litter and her body will self abort the litter.<br>  <br>  may small breeds have large heads, most vets are unwilling to put an animal under 4lbs under for surgery which a c-section will require. So someone breeding 3 and 2lbs dogs is rolling the dice on the chance that not only can their tiny female maintain the pregnancy but also safely whelp the litter.|`|bIaywrBCaa	no such thing as a teacup chihuahua, just the runt of the litter. The reason they should not reproduce, at least the female, is because she is too small to have pups and it could well kill her. They are capable of reproducing but should not be bred.|`|p7swtBYzaa	You're kidding, no?<br>  There is no such thing as a "teacup" any kind of dog, that's just greedy byb hype for a runt - badly bred and sure to be sickly - <br>  If the poor thing lives long enough, it certianly can reproduce - it's not a special kind of dog, it's just a badly bred runt of some breed.|`|ydshiNrKaa	there is no such thing as a teacup anything, they are just the runts of a litter that are usually very sickly and don't live longer then a few years.  the reason they exist is because these back yard breeders keep breeding them and selling them to these stupid people who think they are a unique item when in reality they are nothing but the smallest, weakest puppie in the litter.  it's a shame really, when you think about it.|`|Bw18seFqaa	?  there's no such thing as a "teacup"  thats a scam label used by irresponsible breeders to sell a sickly runt for a high price tag.<br>  <br>  Chihuahuas come in ONE size only.. there's no "teacups" "toys" "minis" or any other size.  Chihuahuas are already plenty small at 6 pds or less.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Wow there are some crazy BS answers on here tonight.<br>  <br>  Abnormally small Chihuahuas can reproduce perfectly naturally.  However given their small size there are often complications with birthing.|`|XagPxe7Faa	"Teacup" is a marketing term used by unethical breeders to describe dogs bred to be extremely small with no regard to the health of the dog.  in otherwords, runts.  There is no recognized subcategory for any breed known as a "teacup."  Extremely small dogs *can* reproduce, but they *shoudln't* reproduce.  It would be extremely dangerous for an very tiny dog to carry, deliver or even conceive a litter.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	There is no such thing as a teacup chihuahua. 'Teacup' chihuahuas are bred from the runts of an already tiny dog, and usually teacup parents are unhealthy due to poor breeding practices and inbreeding. Breeding an unhealthy dog that small would cause the mother to die, or at the very least her puppies will not survive or be severely unhealthy.<br>  <br>  If she wanted a dog that small she should've gotten a hamster.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	It has to do with the gene pool. To put it simply they are bred for their small size but unfortunately their size is actually a genetic abnormality which carries other issues in the data. Basically it is like a chain of traits. They are bred for the small size but the trait of sterility is essentially ignored. <br>  <br>  That being said i have not heard that they are unable to reproduce and it is very risky and irresponsible for anyone to breed with the intent of producing animals with genetic abnormalities simply for popularity.|`|1WmDOPGtaa	A "teacup" anything is essentially a poorly bred runt.  They are often sickly and it doesn't surprise me at all that breeding is difficult (though surely not impossible).  I don't know if it's that their reproductive organs often don't function or that a b*tch can't carry the litter or a little of both.  The second actually makes a ton of sense if you think about it.  Essentially these dogs are whatever breed minus the "teacup" (in this example a chihuahua).  Chances are good that most of the pups will not be "runts."  That's a HUGE amount of strain for a dog that size.|`|p5R1GUH1aa	they can reproduce, artificail insimination and c-sections are common in breeds that can not breed naturally such as englisg bulldogs, sometimes pugs and more. Be very careful with this breed, due to their size they have hypoglocemia and usually the soft spot on head doea not close all of the way, if the head gets bumped it can be deadly.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	The problem is that they CAN reproduce.<br>  <br>  They exist because the smallest dog from every litter is taken and bred to an even smaller dog. Most of the time, the mothers die because the litters are too "large" for them to carry to term. <br>  <br>  Oh, our world would be PERFECT if they couldn't reproduce.|`|BNKBs4Peaa	Teacup chihuahuas formed like other dogs. They bred a runt from a chihuahua litter, and bred that runt with another runt. Since they are so small, they can't reproduce. But other runts that are as small can, providing smaller puppies.|`|eVY2SOzIaa	They can reproduce if they are healthy and at least 3 pounds typically, but because of their size can have difficulties with pregnancy and delivery. C-sections are common.

The most popular toy breed in the U.S., the "Yorkie" has won many fans with his devotion to his owners, his elegant looks, and his suitability to apartment living.<br>  here's more info:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/yorkshire-terrier.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/yorkshire-terrier.htm...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|104Nw5q2aa	Alright heres my little trooper:<br>  <a href="http://i316.photobucket.com/albums/mm337/DivineIndian/TheGoodPic-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i316.photobucket.com/albums/mm337...</a><br>  And dont let the looks fool you he is one mischievous dog.<br>  But then again i love him and wouldnt give him up for anything.<br>  In my opinion he trained pretty easy and even with the few accidents he has, he tries to keep it to a bare minimum. He used to bark for any sound he heard. Nowadays he only barks at people. I remember always being scared he wouldnt eat much. yorkies do that. They scare you. And he still nibs me and makes me mad but i forgive him and think he is a great dog. Good luck with yours and hope for all the best!!|`|v5K2UwZ7aa	Ok I just got a puppy yorkie and I will tell you that they are hilarious! They are so cute but there are some things you should know. In bad weather such as rain (i don't live in/by snow so i wouldn't know) they refuse to get wet or go outside which means they "tee tee" in the house and possibly poop if they have to go whether they are trained or not. Also, one minute he can be lying down sleeping and the next he could disappear into doing something he shouldn't. When it's quiet know that he is getting into something. if getting a girl get spayed right away for they start ministration early. I recommend not leaving him alone and get a dog sitter or the dog will get very upset. Remember it is a lap dog. Don't get mad if he bites for it is the way they show affection. I have to go but these are the main things you need to know.|`|BNKBs4Peaa	Yorkies are yippers. If you have children, or easily annoyed members of your family, this could be a problem.<br>  <br>  They also can have health issues. They easily get infections too. <br>  <br>  They are sweet though, and good pups. Good Luck!
sMxsGrEcaa	A bed, toys, water/food bowls, a collar and lead, some training treats. Newspaper! You're going to need a lot of it! And disinfectant to clean with to get rid of the smell (so he isn't more inclined to go there again).<br>  <br>  Research! Decide which ways you are going to train him and let your family know - nothing worse than conflicting training methods.<br>  <br>  That should be a good start.|`|ObiI8WKHaa	Here are the basics:<br>  Bed<br>  Water and food bowl<br>  sturdy collar and leash<br>  Several toys(so he doesn't chew your stuff)<br>  Treats(for training)<br>  Grooming brush<br>  puppy shampoo<br>  Good Luck.

nrW601l8aa	I my self like the pomeranian|`|iZLHDZ4saa	Personaly I would say a yorki because they look very cute, but the other dogs I woulden't get.|`|bIaywrBCaa	from your choices, a pomeranian,,, but my choice would be a chihuahua.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	I think the Maltese has a better temperament. All the Yorkies I've seen have been nasty and all the Pomeranians have been yappy.<br>  <br>  Also, it doesn't matter which breed is a better pet as a puppy. It will only be a puppy for a few months, so it's much more important which will be the better pet for the 15 years after that.|`|EcQeNu3raa	That question is really a matter of opinion. I like all 3 but I chose a maltese. You should probably do some research on all 3 and make your decision based on the differences like temperament, potty training, life span etc.|`|7XGjs8cyaa	Yorkies need alot of attention if you get one!|`|lSiEKZFIaa	Pitbull Pure pitbull at least or 3/4 pitty!!|`|AA10572259	They are all toy breed dogs and from what I know have about the same pros and cons.  All small breed dogs need special dental care, if no one has told you.  You need to start brushing your dogs teeth right away and make sure you get it proper dental care.  We didn't have a good vet for a while and I wasn't aware of the fact that I needed to check my Chihuahuas teeth often.  Because of this I had to take him in and have quite a few of his teeth pulled because they were in terrible shape.  I was told by my now good vet that its something that people aren't told but should be aware of.  Also if you get a tiny puppy you need to watch to make sure its eating often enough.  My dog was under a pound when we got him and had to eat every two hours or he would end up with low blood sugar.  Anyway my vote is for a Pom, just because I think they are the cutest of the three.  Good luck.  Oh and I would buy from a breeder instead of a pet store, but that just me.|`|tLARGcr9aa	Get a book on dogs.

The lips are swollen from charging the other fish. You need to get the injured fish out , like now . You can try treatment by having the salt level of 2 tablespoons of aquarium salt per gallon and a temp of 80 degrees F. You might save the fish but don't put it back in the main tank.

cL0aHkYEaa	Your question is SO RIGHT.  Which explains, I guess, why I have four Aussies.  When pundits talk about "the lower animals," I have come to believe that they are buttocks backwards.  Dogs' ethics are clearer, morals cleaner, and love longer enduring.  That's not lower.  Would that it were that we all had a heart like that of a dog's.|`|tTLg4u9laa	For real.  I can guarantee that if the places were switched, dogs would never chop off our ears and our tails, if we had long tails and floppy ears.  Dogs like us the way we are, that whole "unconditional love" thing.  See, we humans definitely do not have unconditional love because we have to physically mutilate a dog so we can love him for what he looks like.<br>  <br>  This is the greatest injustice to do to a dog.|`|wneux5kzaa	My dog, his name is Bear. He looks like a giant border collie because he is (cough) (don't tell him) not pure bred. <br>  He has a gigantic heart, never talks back or out of turn, a <br>  great gentleman, he even has a sense of humility.<br>  Humanity....no. In it's linguist root, it was a bad choice for the meaning, if you know what I mean.|`|AA10246871	You answered your own question.<br>  <br>  They've mastered the art of unconditional love.

I'm sure it will never cease to amaze me why such forces exist.  Perhaps that is why I find life so fascinating though there are few creatures that seemingly reciprocate my interest.   (Not that I think that should be a prerequisite for my inquisitive perspective). But I find there is just so much existential value one can derive from viewing a bug (even a grasshopper!). Or for that matter a bison, mole rat, oyster or even a giraffe! And don't get me started on stupid plants (let the TD's fly!).<br>  <br>  But there is something profoundly different about ones experience with a dog.  There is something meaningfully perhaps even mystically rich about the experience that goes beyond a simple tit for tat, love for love. <br>  <br>  Again, I don't know what it is even though I think there is something quite telling about the ability of one type of life to connect with another.

Y02abtiwaa	Usually they are given a shot of ivermectim or the vet will give you some to take home with you. It kinda just depends on the doctor. Thats basically all of the treatment. Ivermectim is a wide-spectrum antiparasitic medication. The doctor may want to do a skin scrape a few weeks later to make sure the demodexx has resolved. but it can take weeks to a few months to resolve|`|gjD8pndjaa	My dog got it when she was slightly older (6 months) but treatment was seriously intense.<br>  <br>  She needed a daily dose of ivermec until a skin scrape tested negative and then an additional month of dosage after that.  And all this time she also needed medicinal bathes once every few weeks.<br>  <br>  And her case wasn't even that bad, just one small spot on her shoulder and back.<br>  <br>  Overall she was in treatment for 3 months
9kceDOTraa	No one can tell you what's wrong with just this information only.  For starters, what species are we talking about, how old was the mother when she spit them, first time breeding for her?  Then you might want to check on the water chemistry.  My first guess though, these fish sound like they were spit out too early.  Fry from mouth brooders usually get spit out ready to be free swimming.  If the fry are having swimming issues, it sounds like they still have the egg sac attached.  Some pictures of this would help as well as this can be any number of things.|`|8EtKbKzjaa	not enough oxygen or perhaps the food your offering them is too big for there baby mouths. not sure how small they are but could they have been seperated from there parents to early.|`|uqag7LEDaa	Very difficult to tell what is wrong.

Go to the pet store and buy a kit to test for ammonia, a kit to test water Ph, and a kit to test nitrites.

Also make sure the water is at normal temperature, the filter system is clean and running, and that there is enough aeration in the tank.|`|JdcNTholaa	try turning up you filter higher to give more air for them to breath and try to put up the temp a bit higher and you will be good
nXgc461baa	I would personally buy the dog, it may not be the most wise decision however I myself have trouble knowing that animals are being treated this way and would make my  decision based on the quickest fix. Keep the dog for a while if possible and if it doesn't work out try to find a better home for her. Sounds like you really care about this dog and have a special connection with her though. You're a good person for caring so much though. Good luck, I'm sure you'll do what's best for the dog.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	I just read the whole story. You have to do what is best for the dog. I would have taken he puppy in for a few days to find it a nice home with a family member or a close friend. You can report the guy for abuse, becuase hitting is a type of abuse. You could be the dogs chance at life. If yu dont act quick, the dogcould be badly abused.<br>  <br>  Please call the animal shelter and let them get her, she deserves better.|`|xMi8u5KMaa	If you do report it make sure you report it to a pit-bull rescue and not the humane society or pound.

The primary differences are a change in diet and a change in vaccination protocols (google vaccinosis -something you SHOULD know if you own a Berner since they are subject to auto-immune issues).

KeevlZnTaa	Ferrets are nothing like cats, they are more like kittens, and stay like kittens their entire life. They need a lot of space to play, and a large cage.<br>  <br>  Ferrets are extremely high maintenance pets. Start up cost for a ferret is around 500 dollars. When you first get your ferrets they will need to see a vet(not apart of the 500 dollar start up). Most states require yearly vaccinations for ferrets(rabies, distemper) this can cost upward of 150 dollars. They also need monthly heartworm pills<br>  <br>  It is recommended that you have two ferrets, They can sleep together and play in ways that they cannot with you. Ferrets love to interact with other ferrets, bite, wrestle, etc.<br>  <br>  FOOD:<br>  Ferret food is expensive. They should have at least three high quality food mixed together. Marshals food is not a high quality food(do not feed the ferret this). High quality means first three ingredients meat, and no fish.34-36% protein and approximately 20% fat (and low fiber) The high quality food can cost anywhere from 15 dollars to over 20 for a 5 -10 lb bag. Feeding them low quality food may be cheaper for awhile, but will lead to health problems and costly vet bills later.<br>  <br>  VET/HEALTH:<br>  Young ferrets monthly bills may be fairly reasonable, but as ferrets age they are extremely likely to get adrenal disease or another common ferret illness. You are more likely to have a ferret get health problems when they get older than not, and older is only about 4, so expect high vet bills for about half its life.<br>  <br>  CLEANLINESS:<br>  Ferrets are smelly, there is no going around that fact(even descented). Since ferrets are strictly carnivores they have a short digestive tract, and need food available all the time, therefore they defecate every few hours. They also have a musky smell(even decented) it get into everything (clothes, etc). Cages need to be cleaned daily to minimize the smell, if you let it wait the smell will be tremendous. Even cleaned daily you can still smell the ferrets as soon as you enter my home.<br>  <br>  They can be litter box trained, but it is hard, and hit or miss(no pun intended). When they are out of their cage they will not seek out a litter box and will usually just go anywhere. My ferrets never were litter box trained and preferred to go next to the box/dig in it, rather than use it.<br>  <br>  PLAY TIME<br>  Expect to have your ferret out of its cage for a minimum of 6 hours a day, otherwise they will not be happy. Ferrets have a lot of energy and need to burn it off.<br>  <br>  When they are out they must be supervised as they get into everything, climb everywhere, etc. Mine used to love to go on my dvd shelves and knock them all off(finally had to replace the shelves with a cabinet style)<br>  <br>  TRAINING<br>  Some of them can be mean, there is no guarantee. You must be prepared to deal with an aggressive ferret. Do you know what to do with a problem biter? I have a formally abused ferret that was a bad biter(I took some nasty bites to the hands-nerve damage on one hand). Even friendly babies can have personality changes if not properly socialized and trained.<br>  <br>  Ferrets must be nip trained when they are young. There are correct and incorrect ways to do this. Hitting, yelling flicking the nose do not work and may lead to an aggressive and hand shy ferret. All ferrets nip, there is no way to completely stop, but it should be controlled. They should know not to bite you too hard, often, etc. That is where having two ferrets comes in handy(they can play with each other the way ferrets naturally play)<br>  <br>  CAGE<br>  The cage must be fairly large, the ferret starter cages sold in pet stores are not large enough. A ferret needs a multi floor cage, a floor for sleeping, one for eating, and another for "elimination". You'll need hammocks, ferrets like sleeping away from their feces and urine. Get food bowls that lock to the side or else they will throw them off the shelves. Large water bottles are best (32 oz), ferrets need water available all the time.<br>  <br>  Please be sure you have emergency vet money set aside, it is recommended at least $1000 dollars, you do not want to end up as one of the kids on here asking, My ferret is injured how do I treat it without going to the vet. That's not fair to the pet or responsible. I have thousands of dollars put aside for emergencies.<br>  <br>  If you know all the information, and are prepared to make an expensive and long commitment then go for it. Playing with a ferret in a pet store is not an accurate interpretation of what they are like to keep as pets.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Ferrets are very high energy, curious, *quick* (but not really graceful *g*) creatures.<br>  <br>  Housing:<br>  Ferrets should be indoor pets, unless you live in a temporate clime.  They are extremely sensitive to heat (they can tolerate cooler weather, but freezing or very cold is still bad for them).  Their cages should be multi-level, wire bars (not made of wood), solid plastic floor (wire floors are horrible on *any* animal's feet).  Two I recommend are Ferret Nations and Martin's cages.  There should be ample room for litterboxes, food and water, a play area, and many sleeping spots.  Snooze sacks, pop-up tents, hammocks, pyramids--all make great sleeping material, as well as old (but not raggedy or holey) clothes.  Denim can be used for those ferrets who prove to be fabric chewers.<br>  <br>  Diet:<br>  Ferrets are obligate carnivores.  They get their energy from meat protein and fats, not carbs like a lot of animals.  Therefore, a good kibble should be around 35% protein and 19-22% fat from a quality meat source (for older adults).  Kits and young adults can have higher protein (40-50%).  The reason it differs is because high levels of protein can be rough on a ferret's kidneys, especially if they already have an impairment.<br>  Here's a chart: <a href="http://www.mdferretpaws.org/care/food_treats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdferretpaws.org/care/food_tr...</a><br>  Or, you can feed a raw or natural diet.  Raw consists of feeding raw, meaty bones, meat chunks, organ meats, etc and gaining a balance over time.  A natural diet consists of whole live or unthawed prey animals.  These two are, in my opinion, the best.<br>  <br>  General care:<br>  Ferrets really should be kept in pairs or groups.  They are highly social and intelligent.  Plus, a human can not play with a ferret the way another ferret can.<br>  One ferret needs at least 6 hours of out of cage time per day, and half of that with you.  Pairs + need at least 4 hours out (definitely more is better, here), and half of that with you. <br>  They need a wide variety of toys, preferably switched out every few days to prevent boredom.<br>  They need nails trimmed and ears cleaned every 1-2 weeks.  At this time, you should always do a check for signs of illness or abnormalities.<br>  They need a ferret savvy vet, usually on a schedule similar to dogs or cats.  As kits and young adults, a yearly check up, barring incidents, is fine.  At 3-4 (sometimes 2 years), you should make this bi-annually.  It's a good idea to test for adrenal, insulinoma, and regular blood panels at this age (to catch anything early).  They, now, even offer Lupron shots yearly as a possible adrenal preventative (the earlier you start your kit, the better).<br>  The biggest health concerns (or most common, anyway) are: blockages (for kits, it's usually something they've eaten and shouldn't.  For adults, it's usually hairballs), lymphoma (juvenile or classic), adrenal disease, insulinoma, cardiomyopathy, kidney disease, and spleen disorders.<br>  <br>  This isn't comprehensive (obviously).  It's important to do research and learn everything you can about any animal you think about adding to your family.<br>  <br>  Hoped this helped :)
7k7mqSuEaa	Yes, a high quality food would help with his bad breath. My dog is 6 and he's been eating high quality food since he was a puppy. His teeth are still white. Try Innova its an excellent food. Chewing also helps keep his teeth clean. Are you feeding canned food or dry? Dry is better for his teeth. You might want to start brushing his teeth on a regular basis as well if nothing seems to be working.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Dog bad breath and human bad breath are caused by the same thing, the bacteria on the top of the tongue where these bacteria produce very bad smelling compounds.  Sometimes you can see this bacteria as a white substance, especially on the back of the tongue.  This stuff must be removed if you are going to get rid of bad breath.  I use an OraBrush tongue cleaner because it is both a brush and a scraper.  I have witnessed a Vet cleaning a dog's tongue with OraBrush and it cured the dog's bad breath.

Likewise in animals, tartar builds up if it is not removed by chewing on raw bones or other gnawing toys, or by brushing.<br>  <br>  Don't let bad breath from dental disease affect your relationship with your pet.<br>  <br>      <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  When tartar is not removed it develops into calculus, which is the visible hard, yellowy, mineral buildup. Then the gums recede from around the teeth, and other supporting structures for the teeth are weakened, leading to tooth infections and tooth loss. This process is called periodontal disease and is the cause of your pet's bad breath.<br>  <br>  <br>  Apart from tooth problems, periodontal disease also affects general health. Bacteria are released into the bloodstream through the inflamed gums and can lodge in places like the kidneys and heart valves, causing problems in these sites. Therefore, mouth health is important for your pet’s overall health and longevity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most dogs and cats over a few years of age have some degree of periodontal disease, due to not enough chewing on raw bones. While raw chicken wings are suitable for cats and small dogs, larger dogs need shin and shank bones, which most butchers can cut to the required size for you. Avoid cooked bones as they tend to splinter and can puncture the gut. Some cats prefer the chicken on the bones cooked a little, so you can quickly sear them under the grill.<br>  <br>  While most dogs love bones, cats need to be trained to eat them from an early age. Feed your kitten the wing tips, and progress to the entire wing as he grows. Chicken necks are also suitable. Offer your puppy small bones, too. Even though all animals have baby teeth that they will lose as they grow, it is important to encourage bone-chewing behaviour from an early age.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some dogs cannot tolerate bones – causing vomiting and/or diarrhoea. These dogs can be fed rawhide bones, Nylabones, pigs’ ears, or other chew toys, such as Dental Kongs. You can encourage use of these toys by hiding food in them, or coating them with peanut butter or something else your dog likes.<br>  <br>  Dry food is better than tinned food for tooth health, but won’t completely clean the teeth. However, new prescription diets are available from your vet that have a specially designed kibble that helps clean the tooth surface as the animal eats. Ask your vet for more information.<br>  <br>  There are also new treats available called CT Chews for dogs and cats that contain an enzyme claimed to reduce plaque and bacteria.<br>  <br>  Can I really brush my pet's teeth?   <br>  Yes, you can also brush your pet’s teeth. There are flavoured toothpastes containing enzymes that help break down plaque and kill bacteria, although the mechanical removal of tartar is the aim. Do not use human toothpastes, as these are not designed to be swallowed and can irritate the stomach if ingested. There are also various gels and liquids that contain the same sort of ingredients, and are an alternative if your pet disagrees with having its teeth brushed! Again, it is much easier to train your dog or cat to allow toothbrushing from an early age. You only need to clean the outside surface of the teeth, concentrating on the gum margin.<br>  <br>  When is dental scaling necessary?   <br>  Once calculus is present, it usually needs to be removed by ultrasonic scaling. The instruments used are the same as used for humans, and also clean below the gum margin where plaque also accumulates. Loose or infected teeth need to be extracted. Then the teeth are polished to smooth the surface of the teeth to discourage plaque formation.<br>  <br>  This procedure needs to be performed under a general anaesthetic. Anaesthetics can be worrying for owners, but with newer and safer anaesthetic drugs, and better ways of monitoring animals under anaesthesia, there is minimal risk. Pre-anaesthetic blood tests, which check levels of liver and kidney enzymes and measure red and white blood cell parameters, are recommended for all animals regardless of age.<br>  <br>  A yearly checkup is a good idea   <br>  Take your pet to it's veterinarian to get a dental checkup once a year (when it's vaccinations are due is a good idea), since periodontal disease can be a painful problem, and can significantly affect your pet’s general health.|`|qGT4zXGMaa	All dogs breath smells.  How do you know that it sometimes smell worse then other dogs?  Do you go around smelling dog's breaths?  They have dog mints.  I tried feeding it to my uncle's dog, he liked it but I held it so he would lick it not eat the whole thing at once.  If you are really concerned about it which I don't think there is a problem I guess you should take him to the vet, but I'm pretty sure it's ok.

BNKBs4Peaa	Puppies for some reason, get "worms". Most ALL puppies get these and they are known as "Puppy worms". Puppies like to nip, or bite at the worms on their bottoms because it itches or bothers them. She may have swallowed one. Take her to the vet to get some medication to treat worms.|`|o7X96Mnfaa	She could probably use medical attention. However, if you got to your local grocer or even  WAL MARt, you can get a dewromer for about $8. You need to be sure to get the dewormer that says ROUND WORMS & HOOK WORMS. if not it could be fatal. follow dosing instructions, in three weeks  you'll be glad you did it. Added Advice. tohelp prevent from HEART worms, NEVER leave a dish of water out for your pet. always give only as much as you want it to have for the moment. Mosquitos lay eggs in stagnant water, then when your pet goes to drink, the larvae transfer into your dogs blood stream, and infest the heart. Good luck with your dog. I have not given you any advice that i have not followed myself.|`|0WuXhCTSaa	Your dog must have medical attention right away.   Forget any comments that your think are offensive and just take your dog to the vet.  Your dog could die if you don't.  I'm not saying this to be mean in any way, I love dogs.  I would suggest you take the dog to the vet tomorrow or sooner.   You should save what your dog thew up and take it with you to the vet, it will be easier for your vet to know what kind of worm it is and what the problem may be.  It sounds gross, but your vet will be glad you did it.<br>  Good luck, I hope the little guy is ok.|`|Y02abtiwaa	Yes she does need to see a vet. Alot of puppies get worms so dont worry too much. The vet will give you some strongid and antibiotics that will kill the worms. but if you dont take her in it could become serious so i would recommend doing it!|`|fMiLQnSJaa	You should take the puppy to the vet.|`|GaL66jbQaa	You must be kidding. of course that's not ok and she needs medical attention if it really is worms are you sure it's not string|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Your puppy is far too young to be away from her mother for starters, and in many states it is actually illegal to sell them that young.<br>  <br>   Take the puppy to the vet tomorrow morning and ask for some wormer, and get her checked out thoroughly.|`|yrx6GxDcaa	Thin spaghetti-like or short rice-like worms are  indications of internal parasites. A veterinarian can examine a sample of the puppy's feces to detect parasites. You need to get the puppy to a vet now. It should have already been treated for worms.|`|RgYuXggfaa	It is not ok.  She needs to be taken to the vet.  They will determine what kind of worm she has and treat her accordingly.  They will not go away and will get worse.|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	That is disgusting. Call the vet!|`|iQN5KGaTaa	NOOOOO TAKE HER TO THE VET NOW
4aAhEK9daa	DON'T.  The purpose of an Elizabethan Collar is to keep the animal from biting at the stitches but to also keep air flowing to the incision site.  If you cover it with fabric from a sock or sweater you stand a really good chance of the fabric sticking to the incision site.  It's also blocking air to the incision that will keep it dry.|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	A e-collar is a better option as it does not come in contact with the incision.<br>  I would just be a little leery of a fabric rubbing up against the incision and aggravating it.<br>  Possibly causing discomfort,itchiness or a reaction.<br>  <br>  E-collars are more traumatic for owners then the cat after about an hour.<br>  Cats adapt quickly.<br>  They can eat drink and sleep with it on.|`|LURQBU86aa	I haven't personally but I know people that have and it has worked for some and not for others. It depends on the cat and whether or not they're going to leave it on. If you don't want to use the traditional e-collar there are also soft flexible e-collars that cats usually adjust to better.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	That would not work because the cat would be able to get it off.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	I have only used a sock, and never used an e-collar.
k5k8ng1Kaa	Well, he is a puppy so it is expected that he will be rambunctious. What are you waiting for? Take your dog to training as soon as possible. There are probably classes available through your local community college or park district. If not, check your local PetSmart (they are little more expensive). Be sure to select a trainer who uses positive reinforcement rather than punishment (e.g. choke chain, shock collars, etc.) <br>  <br>  You should also work with your dog daily on his behavior. Take him for a 45-60 minute walk everyday then work on specific behaviors. There are great training books and videos available. <br>  <br>  It will also help to get your dog fixed. This will calm him down, protect his health, and help control the pet population. <br>  <br>  Once your dog is taught some proper manners, your dad will probably start to like him better.|`|7k7mqSuEaa	While I don't really have a solution for you I can say your father is treating the young dog like a pack leader would treat an underling. That is why the young dog is constantly following him around, he recognizes his boss and wants to try and please him. Its unfortunate that your dad can't like the dog but he is not doing the dog any harm and the dog will be ok, as someone said he understands your father and like an underling is ok with it. ;) <br>  Beautiful dogs by the way.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	In the dog world it is appropriate for the pack leader to treat higher ranking members of the pack better.  The young dog understands your father.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Since its your dog, who cares if your father doesn't like him?  If he didn't like him that much, then you wouldn't have him at all.  Obviously, he at least tolerates him.  I wouldn't worry about it so much.  If you've had him this long and he hasn't warmed up to him yet, then there's not really anything you can do.  My only suggestion is to simply sit down and have a mature and rational conversation about the situation.  Let him know that it hurts your feelings that he doesn't treat both dogs the same and that it would make you very happy to see him at least try to give the younger dog a fair chance.  Other than that, consider investing some more time and energy in training him.  He needs to be well socialized and all of his "bad behaviors" need to be corrected.  Since you are the owner, its your responsibility, not your fathers.<br>  <br>  *My father is similar.  He's been that way for 50+ years and nothing I say or do is gonna change that, so I've just accepted it and moved on.  One day, you'll be in your own home making your own rules and all of that stuff won't matter.  For now, while living under his roof, just learn to live with it.
iwMpJ6p0aa	I hate when people say mutts for yorkie-poo. The cross breed is specifically made for it to be hyper-allergenic, in other words for people who have allergies cuz of dogs and they want to have a dog, this would be the correct breed. You would know what to expect with the yorkie-poo, just read on the characteristics of both and then you would know what to expect and it would be safer for people in your house if theirs any people with allergies|`|bIaywrBCaa	either the yorkie or the toy poodle, not the mutt, I mean "yorkiepoo". It would probably cost you twice as much as a purebred.<br>  <br>  I owned a toy poodle years ago and she was wonderful!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Cuteness is the worst reason to get a dog. Also the yorki-poo is not a breed, and frankly sounds vulgar, its a yorkshire terrier x poodle mix. <br>  <br>  <br>  All are toy dogs. IM not the best at toy dogs. But like any breed of dog YOU need to do the research not some strangers online.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Do not BUY a Yorkshire x Poodle=If you want this Adopt a MUTT.<br>  <br>  Remember puppies require you to be home most of the day, max time away is 2hours! Adult dogs can be left home MAX 8hours!<br>  <br>  1st option, Adopt and Save a life & DON'T reject the adults!<br>  <br>  Looks like your based your choice on cuteness factor 1st,<br>  Temperment is way more important, follow by exercise requirements & grooming! DO NOT choose a breed based on cuteness factor-Lets face the facts, CUTE puppy as they get older, they LOOSE the cute appeal! Example a Husky Puppy is cute? But are they for everyone? No<br>  <br>  All 3 have very high grooming requirements,<br>  Poodles 3-4monthly clipping, the Yorkshire x Poodle=Same as the Poodles-Don't be fooled by the term Poodle x, Doesn't mean they'll be low shedding at all! & the yorkshire terrier also has high matanence coat!<br>  <br>  Mutts are ONLY breed for Profit, they are NOT genetically sound, they have behavioural problems & temperment issues such as aggression, Mutts are bred for 2 reason, Profit and Cuteness factor! By buying from a "breeder" or "petstore" You are profiting puppy mills and backyard breeder and creating a demand, while thosounds & thousand of animals die needlessly in the shelter, pounds & rescue, desperatly waiting for a new home, for the simple reason they aren't enough homes for them all!<br>  <br>  However by adopting from a shelter you are guarantee the mutts or the purebred have a SOUND temperment, as they've been thoroughly temperment tested proior to be put up for adoption, and you are NOT creating a demand and NOT profit irresponsible breeder, you are being responsible and saving a life!<br>  <br>  Because BreedX is 'Cool', was in a movie you saw, is unique and exotic, is free/cheap, or other such nonsense . . . One of the WORSE reasons to get a dog, or any other animal, for that matter, is because of their physical appearance or popularity due to a movie, TV show, or other publicity. Often, these venues feature exotic, rare or unique breeds that are, in the overwhelming majority of pet situations, unsuitable as companions. This visibility may also draw out those 'breeders' whose primary motivation is profit versus health, temperament, structural soundness and the welfare of their dogs.<br>  <br>  And, remember to incorporate the same thoughtful consideration on whether or not to get a dog, and which breed or mix, when your friend, coworker or relative offers you one of Fluffy's puppies. Dogs are never really 'free' or 'cheap' and, in reality, require significant financial, physical, time, and environmental resources. At a minimum, none of these, or other such reasons, are sound selection factors for getting a dog and selecting a particular breed or mix. And, remember, if it is difficult for you to find information on a particular breed, or a breeder of the breed, it follows that you will most likely also have difficulty finding local support services that are familiar with the training, health care, and maintenance needs of that breed.<br>  <br>  INTENTION AND REASON :-Many people getting dogs simply because they are cute and adorable, a nice present for their children and love ones and they always let their hearts rule their heads, they forgot the puppies will grow into bigger sizes and health problems that might arise when the dogs are older, some dog owners would then decide to sell away their dogs when this happens which I strongly discourage as this is an act of irresponsible. Ask yourself what is the intention of you getting a dog or more than one dog? Companion dogs for companion? For emotional support? To overcome your irrational fear such as fear in the dark or anxiety when being alone? Large dogs or Working dogs for protection and house watching? Top breeds for show purpose and enjoy the glory? Please refer to Dog Breeds where you can see all the different dog breeds from a-z. Whatever the reasons maybe I do believe having a good human-dog relationship can bring you therapeutic value.<br>  <br>  Let's start out by saying "THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A "TEACUP" PUPPY".<br>  <br>  With that in mind, let me say this; It seems as though there is a plethora of people who are insistent on buying tiny puppies in the 2 to 4 pound range. Also commonly referred to as a "Teacup puppy".<br>  <br>  The word "Teacup" has been used to merely describe the size of a puppy, meaning it is very small and will probably be under the standard size which is 4 to 7 pounds for the Toy Group, Yorkshire Terrier breed. We cannot imagine anyone wanting anything smaller than that! Their bones are VERY fragile and can be broken by jumping off of a coach, falling off of a bed, being stepped on or worse.<br>  <br>  Many breeders, while tacking a whooping price on a puppy, "claim" to breed so called "teacups" as if they were a breed all their own. Don't be fooled! They are NOT a breed of their own. <br>  <br>  If a breeder says they specialize in "teacups" RUN, RUN, RUN for the hills! Most "TEACUP" puppies are in reality, a premature puppy.<br>  <br>  Most females are bred on the ninth through the fifteenth day of their heat cycles. Eggs can be fertilized for up to 72 hours after any of these breeding's. Therefore, it is possible to have puppies conceived up to a week or so younger than the puppies first conceived in a litter. However, when the first puppies conceived are mature and ready to be born, labor starts and all the puppies will be born, no matter when they were fertilized. <br>  <br>  Some of the problems that may be encountered are both genetic and congenital in these tiny babies and the list is a long one.<br>  <br>  The risk of open fontanels (soft spot from the cranial bone not forming), portosystemic shunts (PSS- abnormal vessel that allows blood to bypass the liver. As a result the blood is not cleansed by one of the bodies filters: the liver.), hypoglycemia, cardiac problems, collapsing trachea, luxating patellas, Leggs Calves Perthes disease, seizures, hydroencephaly, blindness and digestive problems can be increased in these tiny babies.<br>  <br>  Problems such as respiratory problems can remain or worsen throughout their lives. These babies frequently are so fragile that they do not live more than a few years. There have been several tiny Yorkies as adults who still had open fontanels and their owners had to carry nourishment with them all the time. Their vets have felt it unsafe to give a full dose of vaccine so the puppies had to get several injections to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a "tea cup" Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, Poodle, or any other breed for that matter. They simply do not exist. "Tea-cup" is just a marketing ploy given by unethical and unscrupulous breeders to drive up the price of their puppies!<br>  <br>  <br>  So called "Teacups" fetch anything from $1000 to $10,000! This is ridiculous and shameful! There are a lot of chronically, unhealthy puppies because unscrupulous breeders and puppy mills are inbreeding. Some poor darlings only live for a very, very short time!<br>  <br>  They take the little teeny, tiny Yorkies and they breed 2 1/2 pounders with 3 pounders ... well, they’re playing with genetics. You should NEVER breed a female of any breed less than 5 pounds.<br>  <br>  PLEASE educate yourselves before buying a tiny puppy whether it is a Yorkie or any other breed. You could be in for months or years of heartbreak not to mention staggering veterinarian bills! <br>  <br>  DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!! IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PUPPY, DON'T FALL FOR THE TEACUP ACT!|`|btvwigRSaa	Well I have a Yorkshire terrier and he is the best little dog ever!<br>  He is adorable, extremley playful, but grooming is a sore spot with me<br>  You have to brush them 1 once a week and they need regular grooming appointments and I have a short attention span.

n4pNNcGfaa	I can't tell you much about the surgery itself, but I do recommend you try therapy first.  Exhaust all non-invasive treatments first.  I was a biomechanical engineer doing medical research for a number of years.  One thing I learned is that a surgical repair is never as good as helping the body heal itself if that is at all possible.  There is nothing man can do as well as nature when it comes to repairing a living system.  If for some reason it can't heal with supportive care and therapy then certainly surgery would be the way to go.<br>  <br>  If you're concerned about cost, consider getting two opinions.  Surgery at a teaching hospital *might* cost less, but keep a close eye on testing.  They have a tendency to do a lot of extra procedures for practice and that's where costs mount up.  I always ask how a procedure will affect my dog's treatment plan and outcome before giving permission.  Too often the tests are wanted just to know "why" something is, even if it won't change the treatment or outcome.  I don't want my dog getting any more poking, prodding or blood drawing than absolutely necessary, especially when he is already ill or injured.
tPGxPDvBaa	Remove it!!!<br>  <br>  Flea collars are worthless & can be toxic if the dog gets it in his mouth.

1WmDOPGtaa	If it were me, that kind of negative reinforcement would be an absolute last resort.  And I don't think you're there yet.  Positive reinforcement is about more than treats.  It's about what motivates your dog.  Some dogs just aren't food motivated, but a tennis ball or a squeaky toy will turn all eyes on you.  Sometimes it's a matter of finding the right treat, that one that you dog goes absolutely crazy for.  Generally these are stinky little treats, but nothing a good strong soap can't take care of .  Warmed up bits of hot dog or chicken are some favorites, a dab of peanut butter, liver... get creative.  <br>  <br>  With both your dogs, but Jake in particular, you really could use the guidance of a qualified trainer or behaviorist.  Believe me, none of us can do it on our own.  Even the top trainers learned from someone else way back when.  So don't think that asking for help is in any way admitting defeat or a reflection of your own abilities.  Again for both your dogs, but Jake in particular, I think that positive reinforcement is the route.  Look at it this way: Jake already believes that other people are a threat.  If you pair the sight of a stranger with a negative (the shock), this is only going to reinforce what he already believes to be true.  But if you are able to build positive associations with people (say by having them toss him a tasty treat as they walk by) he will begin to look forward to meeting the next person who may have a surprise for him.  <br>  <br>  It's very clear that you adore your dogs.  I have quite a few years on you, and I consider my dogs to be my friends too.  I have no doubt that you are doing the best you can and agree with you that it would be helpful to "step things up."  But I do think you can do better than this particular training facility.  For the record, I am not familiar with the company and only know of their methods what you have stated.  I'm not condemning them.  But I believe that negative reinforcement (especially to that level) should only be used when there is no other choice.  Choose positive training, you won't regret it.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edited to add:  <br>  TJ:  I apologize if I offended anyone with my incorrect use of terms.  Negative reinforcement is always the first term to jump into my mind with electric collars because that is the theory members of my field training group operate on.  When teaching a force fetch there is a low level stim given to the dog that is taken away once they grab the bird.  I did not personally train my dog in this fashion but did do the research before I started so that I could make an informed choice.  <br>  <br>  For the sake of this discussion, go ahead and substitute punishment for negative reinforcement.  But it's still a solid answer and I stand by it.  I never stated that one shouldn't use punishment (which I mistakenly called neg. reinforcement) at all.  You'll notice qualifiers used each time such as "to that level" and "that kind."  I believe that when training a dog you should strive to use the lowest effective level of an aversive stimulus.  To go straight to an electric collar just because the dog has thus far ignored a particular treat when outside is too big a leap in my book.  While punishment may be an occasional necessity, the bulk of any training program (especially in the initial teaching stages) should focus on positive reinforcement. This doesn't mean we become treat dispensing robots, eventually praise is all you need.  It builds the dog's drive to want to please you.  <br>  <br>  You can doubt my training ability if you like but my dog's titles and behavior at large speak for themselves.  It's a shame you feel the need to attack.

Yes u can fight w/ people saying that they are every bad for the dog but cuz E-collar have dramatically change from the 30+ yrs when u would only have one type of stimulation and i was every high, now u can get a every nice E-collar that can go from 1-127 (but no one ever uses 127) my fav brand is dogtra collars water proof, 1+ mile range, 2hour battery charge etc... anyways about ur dogs<br>  <br>  Case 1: Oliver<br>  NO hes not going to be a robot w/ the E-collar u are just going to have more control w/ his unfocused ways but cuz he doesnt want treats then u will have to look for other things like praise ALOT, &/or toy that help some dog out. The cool thing about the e-collar is that when u are in a higher level of training, off leash training will be every easy for u cuz u can correct w/ out a leash on him at all times.<br>  <br>  Case 2: Jake<br>  Its going to be a hard dog train and i would think the trainers would tell u to get a private lesson for him (for the safety of the other dogs, and people) and dont take that the hard way just take the private lessons w/ him it will help u under stand more of ur dogs behavior and how to stop it. A E-collar will be good BUT u would have to invest on a muzzle for him for the safety of u and ur trainer cuz a dog has a flight or fight mode and w/ him it going to be fight/bite and sometime they dont care if he bite u.<br>  <br>  <br>  the last thing will have to see if the trainer knows the right way to use the E-collar<br>  Example: putting the E-collar and zapping the collar right a way is the wrong way of doing it cuz dog doesnt know what the correction is, so u will get a dog that will *A be every scared of the e-collar or *B will build a pain tolerant to the collar. but working them w/ the collar by using a leash first and give corrections like u would do w/ a pinch or flat collar make the dog better under stand the collar and what u want them to do for u.<br>  I hope this helps u under stand more of the training w/ E-collar and that looking for a trainer w/ lots of experience w/ this collar can teach u that its just NOT bad for them its the better way to control ur happy go lucky dogs. And I do like some of the Sit mean Sit trainers some really know what they are doing so good luck.|`|tLARGcr9aa	Find a training class that doesn't use negative reinforcement.  Positive reinforcement works much better when used consistently.  Dogs want to please you.  Always praise and reward.  Some dogs don't want treats they want affection.  Good Luck|`|JiCKFTuIaa	"If it were me, that kind of negative reinforcement would be an absolute last resort"<br>  <br>  Obviously someone has no idea what operant conditioning even is.<br>  <br>  The only difference between positive and negative REINFORCEMENT is positive is adding something and negative is subtracting something.<br>  Reinforcement causes or enhances a desired behavior.<br>  <br>  Punishment reduces or prevents a behavior, and again positive is by adding something and negative is subtracting something.<br>  When you stick your knee out to prevent the dog from jumping up, that is Positive Punishment. When you ignore the dog to prevent jumping up, that is negative punishment. When you don't give the dog the cookie, that is also negative punishment.<br>  <br>  The reality is that it is totally impossible for you or your dog to go through life without experiencing all four segments of operant conditioning. So get use to it, and forget the idea that you can train a dog using nothing but Positive Reinforcement because it is a total impossibility.<br>  <br>  So the question isn't should or shouldn't all four segments be used, the question is HOW should they be used.<br>  <br>  Besides operant conditioning, there is also classical conditioning, and unless you know how and when to use each, you only THINK you know how to train a dog.<br>  Classical and operant concepts are the foundation of ANY training program/method, and without an understanding of those concepts ANY training program/method is standing on shaky ground.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Try your local training club they have all kinds of fun classes and workshops. <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/training_clubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/trai...</a>
o93EwErKaa	You may have to shave or clip the hair around the teats if the mom has a lot of hair.  I would also encourage you to get the puppies mouths checked by a vet for a cleft palate which makes forming a suction impossible.  It seems unlikely that all would suffer from this, but this is the most common reason (other than being premature) for failure to nurse.  Wet the puppy's mouth and teat and hold each one without competition to see if they are able to latch on.<br>  <br>  They can be spayed/neutered around 4 or 5 months.|`|AA10034051	get down there are find the nipples and place them on them or feed them by hand with an eye dropper and warm milk. They can be fixed at 3 months|`|L22hVXTIaa	HOLY COW - If those puppies haven't nursed in 2 days, they won't last much longer!  Puppies should nurse within minutes of their birth and then every few hours thereafter.  The first puppies born should get given a turn at the mother's nipples even before she completes delivery of the other pups.  Something is very wrong and it could be the puppies have no sucking reflex!.  You can take each puppy and place it up to the females nipples - you may have to assist them, but try to get one of her teats in their mouth.  <br>  <br>  But, you really should get them to the vet ASAP!!

You can get some gravel from your community aquarium and put it in the cichlid aquarium .. that should introduce some bacteria into the tank.

SIWPuGMlaa	i'm new at buying saddles also, and i have learned the very hard way that all thos "starter sets" for $199 and such are crap. they wont last, and now i am stuck with a crap saddle that i cant seem to even GIVE away....  now i am borrowing a saddle from where i keep my horse and am saving up for an Ovation english saddle (they run for just under $1,000 and have very good reviews) check those out! also collegiate i heard are awesome, but most peeps have told me they like Ovation better, and the leather on the ovation is better.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ax4vMCejaa	I would recommend getting one that is not a starter kit. That one does not look like it will hold up very well. Try Dover saddlery.<br>  <br>  www.doversaddlery.com i've bought all my tack form them and they have tack for reasonable prices that are great quality.|`|CoAc5hS9aa	That is one strange looking saddle. Those starter sets.. Most people say that they are not good quality. This saddle definitely does not look nice at all. I would suggest getting a used leather saddle. I got my saddle from st. croix saddlery.. They have cheap used english saddles for a steal of a deal. They also have a saddle trial deal. Here is the website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stcroixsaddlery.com/Used_Close_Contact_Saddles_s/393.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stcroixsaddlery.com/Used_Clos...</a><br>  <br>  My favorite brands are HDR and Collegiate!|`|1gu71eYNaa	i will be honest with you, it looks like a peice of crap. sorry but its true. if you want a good quality saddle try a pessoa or HDR. those are great for hunter jumpers.|`|MjECFWPlaa	This saddle could be both good and bad.<br>   Here is the good thing about it:  It looks very nice and it comes with all the needed accessories like, bridle, girth and I think even a blanket.  <br>  Here is what COULD be bad about it.  Is it all real leather? It may not hold up well if its not.  It may not fit your horse you are going to use it on.  I would recommend you look into a saddle that has more information with it.  Good luck with saddle choosing!   It may be best to buy a saddle that is used and in good condition or one that you can try on your horse.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Honestly, no it doesn't.  The leather looks like it's poor quality and the saddle doesn't look very sturdy.  Might be OK just to plod around in but it's definitely not appropriate for a horse show.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	No it does not look like a good saddle at all. I like the suggestion of a HDR - that was my first saddle. Beware, good quality saddles start at about 800 dollars - without all that stuff included! You'll need to buy your own irons and leathers on top of it! But I still have my HDR and it's about five years old now. Still a good working saddle! It's too small for me, so I am searching for a new one.

I have been told that people eat dogs in several countries.  The thought of it make me sick.  The think that bothers me most is not eating another animal; it is tormenting another living creature.<br>  <br>  I was very sad to hear about T-Bone.  That is a heart-breaking story.  <br>  <br>  You might want to check out the following site.  I listed a 2nd site which is information relating directly to helping these animals in the Phillipines.

I ask you only to consider another viewpoint.<br>  <br>  In a country where 1 American dollar is worth so much, poverty must be a factor.  These stray animals can be a source of food for the people.  Your grandmother paying a man to torture/kill a cat seems to be wrong from the American viewpoint, but you have to remember, the Philippines aren't American.  The people there have different traditions and viewpoints than we do.  It was wrong of them to kill your dog from our viewpoint (one I stand by), but it would be wrong of you to detest them because of their different beliefs.<br>  <br>  I know this really has nothing at all to do with your spay/neuter idea, but it is something to consider.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You are trying to do a noble thing. <br>  I do believe it would be futile. I have been there also on may occasions and have seen the way they live.<br>  You are battling their culture, their poverty and their way of survival. We see it as cruel, they see a dog or cat as food. Spay/Neuter would not be saving the dogs life, it would still be eaten.  <br>  <br>  The money is best spend on education, on teaching them a better way. It would be better to combine forces with a major organization (NOT ANY PETA affiliates)  that has the same goals and more resources. You could do it as a trust so that the money only goes to that one goal. I don't think any one person would have the funds to make a noticeable difference in the huge problem in that country<br>  <br>  Don't fault your Grandmother-- I recently found out my great grandfather fought pitts and raised them to fight, plus he fought raised and sold gaming cocks.

ZT0K3q2Aaa	Your puppy is just doing what puppies do, and is going to start teething, and wanting to chew on things more. I found a really good trick that works with puppies.. When a puppy nips you, or does something you dont like, you yelp, like a dog that got hurt. That is something that their litter mates would do if something hurt them, and that teaches them that they shouldnt do that. He will associate that yelp noise, as something he shouldnt do, or something that hurts. SOunds weird, i know, but when my chihuahua was a pup, and still to this day hes is 3 years old, we do that with him, and he stops whatever he was doing.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I totally agree with yelping.  I have had herding dogs all my life and they are nippy dogs.  Especially the BC's and ACD's (omg!!).  These dogs will often retain their nipping well into adulthood if you don't teach them early not to nip.  The most affective way I've found to communicate the "no nipping" is the yelp.  I've got a scary good one that stops puppies in their tracks and freaks people out.<br>  <br>  Seriously, go someplace and practice yelping.  If you've heard your puppy yelp, try to get something that sounds close to that.  And then every time you're playing with your pup and feel teeth, let out a sudden, loud, yelp.  You'll know when you have it right because the pup will usually back off and offer up some sort of appeasing behavior ... like licking.  Either they will lick your hand, or just lick the air.  That's dog talk for ... I'm sorry, I'm no threat to you.  Add in a little ignoring them for a min or two and, pretty soon, it will click with them that teeth on you, hurts you and makes you not want to play anymore.<br>  <br>  This is very close to what puppies do with each other.  If you have a particularly persistent puppy, some terrier breeds can be this way, you might need to add in some crate time after the yelp to really send the message home.  <br>  <br>  The idea really is to make sure they get a CLEAR message as to when they've crossed the line and give them a CLEAR consquence.  Puppies want to be with you, they want to play with you, so shutting that down for a few mins after they've crossed that line sends a very powerful message to them.  And they learn quite quick if you're consistant with it.  <br>  <br>  It might be that your pup spends a day or two bouncing in and out of his crate for playing too rough, but ... if that's what it takes, it's well worth it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8r9WoizDaa	you know i found this to work with our horse that liked to bite you when you werent paying attention. find something your puppy dislikes but wont make him sick like tobasco sauce and put alittle on your hands and hopefully he will learn that when he bites your hand he gets the nasty taste in his mouth. otherwise there isnt much you can do. puppies teeth and they will chew on almost everything even you XP lol. so put up all your power cords and anything you dont want teeth marks in =)|`|RgYuXggfaa	Definatly try the yelping.  It worked for us.  We had a herding mixed breed dog  She did lots of nipping.  She would do it to us and we would yelp.  It worked nicely.  However the puppy we have now doesnt care.  I had a friend that would do it too loudly and I think he just go immune to it.  We fake cry, the sobbing kind.  He stops right away.  We did try useing hot sauce but he likes the taste of it.  Just keep trying different things.  Something will work if you are constant.|`|fbZjUTCRaa	try holding his mouth shut for a second or two when he does it and just say no.  just be careful not to do it too hard or make him bite his tongue

rTSwouqXaa	I was raised on a working ranch. I never thought about it. heh. I guess some folks think something about it differently. I honestly never thought about it.<br>  <br>  Hehe We have neighbor in his late 40's pass out while we castrated his son's show steer. hahaha...I about died laughing.<br>  <br>  And we are talking about animals. We are not talking about human genitals. My folks never hid any of the ''dirty'' little things that happen on a working cattle/horse ranch. Its just life. The sooner you learn that the sooner you are on your way to be an adult. And isn't that what growing up is about?|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I don't know if there is an ideal age, but there is definitely a need for correct preparation.  Children are unable to emotionally deal with things they don't understand.  The younger a child is, the more they internalize what they see happening around them.  So, the way this situation was handled was unfortunate, to say the least.<br>  I personally have allowed my children to observe a variety of procedures performed using anesthesia from a fairly early age, after preparing them for what they would see and why it was being performed, and giving them the option to either participate or not.<br>  None of them was ever traumatized by it.  But this situation would have been nightmare-producing trauma for them.<br>  Unless there is good reason for the children to bear witness to this procedure, then it is best to keep them away.  But if this is something being done on the ranch where children live, at some point they will be curious about it, and their imaginings may be worse than a well explained reality.  Those children need to be introduced to the procedure and allowed to become comfortable around it.  There is no need for visiting children to be involved, in my opinion.<br>  I'm a little confused about aunt Sandy having a knife, since I don't consider a knife to be an appropriate castration tool, but I'm no expert.<br>  Here is an interesting article on cattle castration.  Some countries mandate the use of anesthesia when cattle are castrated.  This article lists studies done to determine levels of pain and physiologic stress related to various means of castration, and is worth a read.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avma.org/reference/backgrounders/castration_cattle_bgnd.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.avma.org/reference/background...</a>|`|AA11484393	I think any age is fine, but the kids should have been prepared first.  It is not fair to show them that without giving them a fair warning, and letting them decide when they feel ready to see that.  Still, I would say 9 is the bare minimum, because before then, even if it is explained, they would have no way of truly understanding what was happening.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	I've never really thought about it. I grew up around horses and other livestock so i'm just used that kind of stuff. <br>  <br>  If they wanna watch then fine. There really isn't much blood and the animals are fine afterwards. Maybe I am biased because after watching a stallion being castrated a bull calf seems slightly anticlimatic.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	my step-daughter is 10, she is an absolute tomboy, but i would not permit her to watch us castrate our bulls; i think at least 14 or 15 is the youngest kids should see this, when they can understand, i know that when you grow up raising cattle kids help out with a lot at a young age, but this is something the adults should do themselves|`|paaozogGaa	Idk I think that is way to young to watch anything related to that! <br>  Gosh 7? they haven't even had sex ed!!!<br>  sounds too young to me!|`|YtBzRAxMaa	Sorry - I am 46 and would have thrown up or passed out.<br>   Seems rather barbaric to me to have a family gathering "party" while you slice of parts of babies.<br>   The children needed to be informed as to what was going to happen - what they would see and what they would hear. The sound of an animal in terror and agony causes most people/children to become frightened and nervous.<br>   THEN they should have been allowed to choose not to be there.<br>   Not every "farmer" wants or needs to witness castration.<br>   Aunt Sandy needs to grow up and think.<br>   Aunt Sandy has caused a whole lot of nightmares...|`|hxcg0Rlkaa	Um, I'm 15 and I do not even think it would be appropriate for /me/ to see that. I mean, in what way does that enrich anyone's life? I don't see a big point in watching that and the only thing that I can figure it would do is traumatize someone. Which is pointless. I mean unless you're doing it yourself, learning how to do it, or preparing to become a vet I really see no reason for anyone to watch that.|`|SIWPuGMlaa	i would say teen-ager, if they are ok with what was going on and understood why. perhaps if those kids understood what was about to happen they may not have wanted to be there. perhaps as long as they understand and would like to participate. kids are people too and they would probably like the choice. i know lots of people who grew up on farms, and they never wanted to be a part of that, but i also know lots of people that never had it bother them (someone has to do it, lol)|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Well the gore of it is another story, but if you mean just because of the sexual organs in the procedure, then any age. I don't think children should be "protected" from this type of thing - its not "bad". But that is my opinion,|`|6xl8v3fnaa	I think it totally depends on the kid. I've been around animals my ENTIRE life and I have absolutley no issue with it. Were horse breeders.  But I know some of my friends and city family would be like disturbed.|`|gzQAIahaaa	If they already knew what happened i think it would be ok but just letting them watch with no warning is stupid.|`|LzXZQBHbaa	Well from the answers you can see who's grown up around cows and who hasn't. It's the facts of life. If these children were visiting and had never been on a ranch...they should have been warned. But if you go to any ranch where I live...it's a way of life. Kids grow up around it. By the time they hit 13, they've already had their parents showing them how to do it. 14-16, they are castrating pretty proficiently. <br>  <br>  And it's not sick to get together at a branding. It's always been a custom to have a big noon time dinner during the branding that is usually equivalent to a Thanksgiving feast it seems. It's a time for these ranchers to be thankful...they have new stock to brand. It's not a sodomizing party, my goodness!|`|TJTshBheaa	Had a previous boyfriend whose family were farmers. I was there one day when they were branding and castrating. His brother's little boy, about 2 or 3 I think had all the bits of the calves ear that had been cut off lined up as they were being done. But you've got to remember farm kids get used to things like that being done, just as they get used to deaths, injuries etc. to stock because it happens more frequently. They did a "kill" of 3 sheep for meat, and he didn't seem to worry that they were all lined up with their throats cut when he saw them. The kids still got upset when a pet died though, just as city kids do.|`|q5S8VnuGaa	its ok. maybe someone should have been there with them to explain what and why they are doing, instead of just letting them stand there.|`|3JwLJmgxaa	ha funny story.

gof1GvUuaa	It's like the law on automatic guns. They banned everyone from owning one. They are trying to do that with pit bulls but really its all about the owner. Automatic gun is the most powerful gun but its all about whos hands its in. Getting a pitbull you should be aware that they will be just as nice  as you raise it. Pitbulls are sweet but yes like any other dog they may bite. it just so happens they have a strong bite. not their fault just raise them right....|`|o7X96Mnfaa	You made me what I am today, courage at its’ best.<br>  You wanted me to know NO fear, a cut above the rest<br>  Not only did I master that, I threw in loyalty, too.<br>  Look past my eyes, and into my soul, you know I’d die for you.<br>  I’ll watch your kids, I’ll watch your house<br>  Your praise will be my crown, ask what you will<br>  I’ll do my best, I’ll even be your clown.<br>  But some of you don’t like me.<br>  I’m sure I don’t know why.<br>  The only thing I’m guilty of, <br>  Is courage love and try.<br>  But still they want to see me go,<br>  They want my breed to end.<br>  I will  see you sitting idly , you ,  whom I call a friend.<br>  You  made me what I am today<br>  You never saw me waiver.<br>  I’ve done my best to keep you safe,<br>  Won’t you please return the favor?<br>  <br>  I have raised PITBULLS for 20 + yrs. I will never turn my back on the breed. A well socialized pitbull is the greatest friend you can ever have. please be sure you have the time and energy it take s to own a pitbull.   If you have ANY questions about hte breed, you can YIM  me at king_typo  or just e mail me @ king_typo@yahoo ( email would get you a faster response. If i can not answer your question, i will readily  have people to help me help you.|`|FfWgblFCaa	i honestly feel that people have ruined there reputation... thay are amazing dogs and can be extremely loving if people would give them a chance...|`|eu6UQElYaa	Clearly way too many people don't know how to handle them.  Making for dangerous situations for innocent people.  That's my honest opinion and statistics.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	IMHO I hope someday we won't have to answer these countless questions, because people will quit trying to segregate them into some kind of killer category<br>  They are dogs, in the right hands they are loyal family dogs. In the wrong hands they are fought, maimed and killed for money and sport.<br>  What do I think about them? They deserve warm loving homes just like every other dog alive.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	A very misunderstood breed, blamed for man's wrong doing.<br>  <br>  With the APBT breed, The media chooses to focus most of their attention on that specific breed. And on top of that, people choose to take advantage of this powerful breed, and make it aggressive, only adding to the pitbulls bad wrap in society<br>  <br>  The media always has a field day, when it comes to pitbull attack stories. Just remember, no dog is born bad, they are only influenced by the way they are raised.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Funny everyone has 2 thumbs down, but no one has put a different opinion.<br>  <br>  I love the Pit Bull types. They get a bad rap because all the media attention on them is negative. The dogs are the problem the owners are. People breeding them and just handing them over to people is another problem.<br>  <br>  I still find it funny people get their views from TV not from their own experience. they will rattle off stat numbers of Pit Bulls who have attacked or hurt someone but ill put the same thing again <br>  <br>  Where are the reports tell how many Pit Bull Types are in homes who have never bitten the children, adults, or other pets? Pit Bulls who have had their eyes poked, tail pulled, ears yanked, fur pulled, by children and never did a thing to harm them in return?|`|AA10034051	I had a pitbull/ cocker spaniel mix, she was the best dog I ever had, she died 2 years ago she was 16 years old.|`|RNqHUNgEaa	I've always liked them, they are sweet and cute.|`|7tQGlSRuaa	Pitbulls are awesome, great dogs!! They are unfortunate to be born into a breed that has such a bad reputation. I totally agree with the "punish the deed, not the breed" slogan. Any breed can be trained to attack, any breed can be trained to kill. When trained and owned by loving and caring people, pitbulls are the sweetest dogs.|`|r8drw5Dcaa	They are great dogs for the right people.<br>  But for those that think everyone should get one or the media is prejudice against them, let me ask you this.<br>  Would you let a 5 year old child play with a pit bull unsupervised?<br>  A couple did do this and the dogs tore the child apart, simply because the dogs felt like it, they were even happy to see their owners with blood on their faces, just wagging their tail as happy as they could be.<br>  I can't find that story but just google it, they are horrible dogs around children.|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	First of all Proud: German Shepherds have the highest bite rate than any other breed in the world not Pitbulls.  Secondly I think that this is a great breed for the right owners sadly there are a lot more wrong owners than right owning this breed so that is why they have their rap.  I personally love this breed I have never owned one before but I know some of them and they are great dogs.  Once a female pit I found while walking my dog and my neighbors pack of dogs, she was hurt and wondering around.  She made friends with all of the dogs first than she made friends with me I took her home and cleaned her wounds and nursed her back to health.  Not once did I hear a growl or a snap.  She was in pain because a couple of times she yelped.  I couldn't keep her because I lived in a rent house and we had a two dog limit and I already had two but I did find her a good home.  She wasn't the only one I knew but she was my favorite.  I would love to own a Pitbull in the future since I know that I would fall in the right category to own one of them.  I am a dog behaviorist and I have trained many dogs including a Pits.  I hope in the future a found a rescue so that I can take in dogs on death row so to speak and train them and adopt them out again.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Great dogs for right people.

Qe9y6MnTaa	To teach them to walk next to you hold the bulk of the collar in your left hand(this would be for walking on your right side, switch around if you want them to walk on your left side) and then grab the loose part with your right hand so you can guide the puppy. To make them sit hold a treat, then push down on their shoulder blades to make them sit while saying sit, and after they get what a "sit" is, started snapping your fingers to make them do it or whistle or whatever you want. :D hope this helps.|`|HIMsPI8eaa	lots of practice!!!!! 1 tip: the method of pushing its back end down does not work. Good Luck!|`|qGT4zXGMaa	You are gonna need a lot of treats!  Well You could wrap up the leash in your hand and pull up when you are first walking next to him and probably he or she will get used to it and walk next to you.  But my uncle's dog whenever I take it for a walk for some reason he always has to be in the front.  So I don't even care anymore.  I'm not sure about the stop and sitting one.  You shouldn't scream sit or stop.  It just takes a while.  Don't get angry at your puppy if he or she doesn't listen.  My uncle taught the dog to stay in sign language ( I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE DID THAT. )  Good luck with your puppy!|`|DlpMaUwjaa	Everything you want to do is possible with ALOT of work, time and effort on a daily basis.
9kceDOTraa	Quite a number of things can cause this.  For starters, the word cichlid doesn't tell anyone anything of value.  What species, what sized tank, what are the tank occupants, how mature is this tank, what does your water chemistry look like, COMPLETE chemistry, not just pH or nitrogen compound readings either.

8cikAYp3aa	MM's been around for 30+ years.  It is a demanding school and some people simply don't make it.    If your willing to work for a dream, want a solid background and base for a career then it is well worth the money.  I've friends now with kids who have graduated or will be graduating from there shortly and none of them regret a penny spent.  The school is not going to simply pass you on to get your money for the next years class's.  That seems to bother some people who feel that they paid for the class so they are entitled to a excellent grade without managing the course work or attempting it at all. <br>  <br>  So what it boils down to is If you want to attend a school that will provide you with good skills, good basics and background.  Will train you to achieve positive results by hard work and study  then Meredith is for you<br>  If you simply want to be someone who says "  I attended HPTS"  and not work for your grades.. then go elsewhere|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	i saw this q' before ...<br>  put "meridith manor" into the "search for questions" on the main page of yahoo answers.<br>  the review i saw was extremly unfavorabale!<br>  edit... i was trying to be nice with my comment above...<br>  20 years ago when I got my AI, I did go to meridith manor.<br>  it was pretty run down then, and they have not updated or improved their facility.<br>  they do not have turn out, other then a few mud pits, if u plan on taking your horse.|`|SIWPuGMlaa	never been but if you are visiting then im sure you can make a good decision.  ask people that attend it already and see what they say, or people who dont attend anymore and find out why they chose not to?|`|7KUYwLB3aa	I am considering going there also, I'm interested in seeing the answers to this as well.
0imdwy7Paa	Who are these idiots that think that dogs don't get periods?! Most people call it going into heat though. This will sound weird. But her crotch will get bigger and kinda looked pear shaped. Honestly get her spayed. that way you don't have to worry about blood getting all over, and you wont have every male dog in the neighborhood trying to get into your yard when she is in heat.|`|psLk5fDGaa	She could go into heat anywhere between 4 months of age and upward. You will be able to tell that she is heat by the size of her vagina.

However, they tend to keep themselves fairly clean, and while the occasional spotting occurs, blood wont be everywhere.<br>  <br>  I recommend spaying her which will prevent the hassle associated with females in heat. Plus, she will have a lower risk for cancer!|`|mPAnzTF8aa	I don't think dogs get periods honey. Dogs aren't like us humans|`|qGT4zXGMaa	They get periods?

And it's her heat cycle, not a period.<br>  <br>  Please get your puppy spayed.

OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Few dog owners are fortunate enough to avoid an eventual run-in with fleas, the most common dog parasites. Even with regular bathing and grooming, the tireless critters can find their way to the tender flesh of unsuspecting dogs (and dog owners).

KEYgd73saa	You may be able to get the Cardinals and Neons to school together, but the Glowlights are very likely to join in, and the Rummynoses have no chance of swimming along.  As Cardinals and Neons are so similar in appearance, you may be best off just choosing one of those species and getting about 10 of them, and then getting 10 Glowlights as well so you can have two strong schools rather than several weak ones.  Rummynose Tetras get rather large, so I'd be hesitant to make a decent school of them in a 30 gallon tank with so many other mid-water schooling fish about.<br>  <br>  I've kept Brilliant Rasboras for a while, and when I only had 6, there was a very weak schooling behavior-- the fish kinda did their own thing.  However, I bought a dozen more to add to the school (grand total of 18 if you don't want to do the math yourself ;^)) and they hardly leave the others' sides.  You won't see a school without proper numbers, and you won't have proper numbers with four different Tetras.

Nt7exGYAaa	She'll be doing intermittent straining for several hours before the birth of the first kitten, then usually less than an hour between subsequent kittens.<br>  <br>  The placenta will pass after the birth of each kitten, and the mother will clean the kitten and eat the placenta. The cleaning of the newborn kitten is very important and necessary for bonding between the mother and kitten.<br>  <br>  If for some reason she fails to remove the membranes from the kittens face, you should then very gently clean them away from the mouth and nose.<br>  <br>  Most cats don't have much trouble birthing, but if the cat declines food for over 48 hours it's time to contact a vet.<br>  <br>  A vet would need to be contacted if there's more than 3 hours of straining before the birth of the first kitten and more than 1 hour of active labour between births.<br>  <br>  If she hasn't given birth by the three hour limit, phone your vet and have a talk to him and he'll best advise after asking certain questions as to whether she's going well or to be brought in for maybe a C section.|`|MbW8KRoGaa	It is called 'labor' for a reason--it's hard work! Her muscles will continue to tense up as her uterus contracts to push the kittens out. Only after many, many hours of unproductive labor should you consider taking her to a vet--if it makes you feel better, call a 24-hour  vet hospital--and honestly, if your cat has been through two successful labors without veterinary intervention, this one should be fine. <br>  Your cat will walk around a bit, will seem annoyed, will want to drink some water, etc.,--but she is in LABOR. It hurts a lot and she'll want it to be over soon, so try to keep her in the birth box, talk to her and comfort her as you can. Just be patient!|`|sQ4p7tktaa	You should wait.

uTIgyCCHaa	First, what is he on antibiotics for??  Neither distemper NOR kennel cough can be cured with antibiotics; both are viruses.  So what's with the antibiotics??  If there really isn't any definite bacterial infection, the use of antibiotics will only HARM his immune system when he needs that strength to fight off other infections.<br>  <br>  And the vet said they'll put him down if he has seizures???  Good lord, that's ridiculous!<br>  <br>  Secondly -- where did you get the pup?  The situation it came from might give us a better idea of the health and probable outlook of the puppy.  If you bought from a breeder, call the breeder and let him/her know what is going on with your pup; he/she might be able to help you.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, get a new vet... seriously.<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  If you bought the puppy at a flea market, it's either from a BYB or a puppy mill.  Health issues are likely to pop up now and even later down the road with this dog, since the "breeder" most likely did not check his dogs for genetic dieases (possible they were never vaccinated either).  Do some research on health issues common to this breed, and watch out for them throughout your dog's life.  And STILL get a new vet -- the whole thing about putting him down for having seizures... that's just crazy.|`|26PPwzrWaa	What type of bull crap is that. There are meds to keep seizures under control. <br>  <br>  first off, get a new vet.

VtHvcEtuaa	I have no clue what it is, but I would suggest going to a different Animal Hospital because it sounds like the one you went to was not helpful at all.  I would not give the dog any human medication either|`|LURQBU86aa	That sounds like he's having an allergic reaction to something. They really should have given him an injection of diphenhydramine (benadryl) while he was there, and possibly a steroid.

I think that your dog may have contracted Canine Parvo Virus. If he did, it's not just dribble, it's vomit. He's sick and needs VET attention ASAP. He will dehydrate and possibly pass away. lift it's cheeks, and press it's gums. If it takes longer than a second to get it's color back, he' s  dehydrating fast. Take it to a VET.|`|KPas0MBbaa	Try taking him to the vet to get an entire blood, fecal and urine workup to rule out any severe medical conditions.  Also, have them take a look at his mouth.  He many have an infection or a rotting tooth causing swelling of the gums.  My first thought was that he was teething, but I think he is beyond the age of his adult teeth growing in.

Nt7exGYAaa	Rabies is a very nasty disease but fortunately preventable.<br>  <br>  If he's scratched or bitten you and he does in fact have rabies, you'll also need to get injections.<br>  <br>  The link I pasted below is very thorough on this disease. I've just included a small section of the answer here.<br>  <br>  Basically rabies comes in three stages.<br>  <br>  The first is the "prodromal" phase in which there is a marked change in temperament. The quiet cat becomes agitated, and the active cat becomes nervous or shy. Other signs include dilated pupils, excessive drooling, and snapping at imaginary objects. <br>  <br>  After 2-3 days, the second phase begins. It is called the "excitatory" phase. There is an exaggerated response to any stimulus. Cats may experience bizarre changes in appetite including eating and swallowing sticks, stones, and other objects. <br>  <br>  The cat may roam aimlessly, inflict trauma upon itself, and have a change in voice. There will often be vicious, aggressive behavior, even towards its owner. Seizures may occur. Sometimes there is a third form, the "dumb" form, in which the cat becomes extremely depressed. Its mouth may gape open with the tongue protruding. A progressive paralysis sets in resulting in total body paralysis.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	If anyone has been scratched or bitten by the cat, you're going to need to get rabies shots.....  quarantining the animal to see if it's rabies will take too long to wait..... the only way they can tell faster is to kill the animal and examine their brain (unless that's changed recently)... and that can be too late to begin the vaccines.   Why in the World are you allowing an unvaccinated cat outdoors in the first place?  It could also be distemper, your vet will have a better idea what they're looking at -- you should take them in ASAP.  It could also be feline leukemia and the hissing is just the cat not feeling well, or feline AIDS.... both of which can be fatal to the cat, but won't transfer to you.  If you have other animals in the house get all their shots current immediately.
Nt7exGYAaa	A vet will be the only one who can accurately check your cats eyes.<br>  <br>  He can use a special stain to identify if there's any ulcers, or a tear test to check for tear production, a pressure test similar to what humans have to detect glaucoma and a special scope to see right into the eye chamber.<br>  <br>  This will determine if there's any problems with the eyes.<br>  <br>  Depending on what the vet finds is what action is taken.|`|LURQBU86aa	The only way to tell would to be to take him to the vet and possibly and eyecare specialist.|`|8c87d6496f296c7504e4c9925e55361aaa	Take the little fellow to the vet, they can tell you what is the best way to correct the vision.

v0TPzCMCaa	Your cat is VERY unlikely to die during birthing.  While humans often get into trouble, it is because the skull of the baby is very large in proportion to the mother.  The same is not true of kittens - cat births usually proceed very smoothly.<br>  <br>  Here are some things you can do to make the birth easy and natural, and avoid problems:<br>  <br>  1.  Your cat will want to hide her kittens in a dark, quiet place.  Even if you give her a place to have her kittens, she may choose another location that suits her better.  But you want to be able to see what is going on, and make sure no problems are occurring.  For that reason, when a cat is due and you are going to be away (or asleep), I would advise limiting her to one room of the house... perhaps a bathroom or bedroom.  Shut the door and keep her inside, when you are not around to observe her.<br>  <br>  2.  When your cat prepares to have kittens, one of the first signs will be that her breasts will become developed, and when you run your hand across her belly, you will feel the breast tissue under the skin.  Nesting behavior will start a few days before the birth, and she will be seeking dark, secretive places to have the kittens.  She will go to these places and dig around in them.  Put some towels in a box and put the box in one or two of the places in her room that she indicates are interesting to her.  If she accepts the box, she will enter it, lie in it, or get in it and stir the towels around.<br>  <br>  3.  Twenty-four hours or so before the birth, her temperature may drop.  I do not advocate upsetting her by taking her temperature every day, but this is one of the things that happens before the labor and delivery.  Another thing that happens prior to labor is that a waxy plug will sometimes melt and discharge from the vaginal opening.  This is normal.<br>  <br>  4.  Most cats will be in labor for several hours.  In my experience, they often go into labor in the afternoon or evening, and deliver the kittens during the wee hours of the night.  You get up the next morning, and the kittens are there!<br>  <br>  5.  Signs of trouble include:  <br>  <br>  bloody or foul discharge from the vaginal opening without labor<br>  <br>  labor that continues without delivery of a kitten for several hours.  If this is hard labor (the cat is really lying down and pushing and nothing comes out after 2 hours) then you may want to take her to a vet for a check.<br>  <br>  a kitten is partially delivered and does not finish being delivered for over 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  WHAT TO DO:<br>  <br>  STAY CALM.  Your cat will be distressed by your emotions if you get all upset, cry and babble uncontrollably, etc.  Your cat will stay calm and have a far better chance of delivering a healthy litter, if you keep your own emotions in check and deal with the situation in a reassuring manner.<br>  <br>  SEEK A VET.  Call your vet and tell them what symptoms you are seeing.  Answer any questions they ask, and follow their directions.<br>  <br>  Cats can be saved from bad birthing problems by various methods, which include oxytocin injections done by your vet to help the cat's labor strengthen, or C-section (the same thing as a caesarean).  It is usual practice to spay your cat at the same time as the c-section, so that she won't have more difficulties, and so that she won't have to undergo another surgery later.<br>  <br>  Unless you have a Persian, all of this is VERY VERY unlikely to happen... Persians are more prone to these problems because - like humans - their babies skull(s) are larger and harder to deliver.  A domestic cat that is not purebred is very unlikely to have any problems.<br>  <br>  Mother Nature has been making kittens for thousands of years... and the process is quite natural and beautiful.  Barn cats and wild cats have a litter or two each year, for several years of their lives, and suffer no harm.  I am sure your cat will do fine, and that you will have a healthy and beautiful litter of kittens!|`|mhp7JKMNaa	Depends on species/age/etc. Just go to the vet and give birth there. :D|`|a984cQjKaa	your cat will most likely be fine, but you might want to make sure someone is there when she's giving birth just in case one or more of the kittens is born breach (backwards).  if she's having a hard time with a breach baby you might have to help her.  make sure your hands are clean, and firmly grasp the kitten's feet where they're sticking out.  on mama cat's next contraction, gently wiggle the kitten and ease it out (don't yank it!).  it might take a few contractions to get it out.  give mama cat a moment to break the bag, but if she doesn't get to it right away you can break it yourself, and wipe the kitten's face with a damp cloth to get the goop out of it's little nose.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Cats usually don't have problems when birthing. Make sure you feed her kitten food during the pregnancy and while nursing to make sure she's getting good nutrition. Just get a cardboard box and line it with towels making a cut out low enough for the mother to come in and out of but too high for the kittens. Just keep an eye on her. The most you may need to do is help burst open the birth sack around each kitten. Here's a site that's more in depth.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/od/reproduction/a/birthprocess.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/od/reproduction/a/...</a>|`|CbcR2usSaa	take your cat to the vet and get it spayed.  the chance of a spayed cat dying while pregnant is 0|`|Nt7exGYAaa	Around a year old a female cat can usually handle a litter of kittens without any problems.<br>  <br>  Have a nice clean shallow cardboard box ready for her with lots of newspaper in it as this will help keep the mess at a minimum.<br>  <br>  Place the box in a quiet and private area.<br>  <br>  Here's a copy of an answer I pasted to another question in here:<br>  <br>  Many pregnant cats won't eat during the last 24 to 48 hours before the birth.<br>  <br>  When she first goes into labour she'll look for an area to have the kittens so ensure the area is quiet and private. She'll show signs of being very restless for 6 to 12 hours, and then she'll start to strain when the next stage of labor begins.<br>  <br>  You can have a large box that she can get in and out of without jumping ready for her, line it with several sheets of newspaper because it'll be messy.<br>  <br>  Often it's intermittent straining for several hours before the birth of the first kitten, then usually less than an hour between subsequent kittens.<br>  <br>  The placenta will pass after the birth of each kitten, and the mother will clean the kitten and eat the placenta. The cleaning of the newborn kitten is very important and necessary for bonding between the mother and kitten.<br>  <br>  If for some reason she fails to remove the membranes from the kittens face, you should then very gently clean them away from the mouth and nose.<br>  <br>  Most cats don't have much trouble birthing, but if the cat declines food for over 48 hours it's time to contact a vet.<br>  <br>  If there's more than 3 hours of straining before the birth of the first kitten and more than 1 hour of active labour between births contact the vet.<br>  <br>  The cat can come into heat again when the kittens are two weeks old so it might be a good idea to have a chat to the vet now to make arrangements to have it spayed.

KPas0MBbaa	My dog went through this and also smelled and seemed more oily. His eyes also looked a little bloodshot. From what I understand, the excessive amount of oil is the body's/skin's response to all the scratching.  Thus, the more oil there is, it can become rancid and cause your dog to smell more.  It turned out with my dog that he had allergies and we were told to give him doses of benedryl (antihistamine) every few hours until the symptoms abated..  It stopped his itching and eventually his hot spots healed.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	wow, I'm having the same thing happening to my pug.

All those things can be allergenic.<br>    You can give her some the kibble as a treat.<br>  <br>    If this doesn't help, try one of the grain-free kibbles - Wellness has a line of them, and see if that helps.  and ask your vet for a referral to a veterinary dermatologist.  This vet doesn't know anything about allergies - you can't cover them up,  they need to be solved form the inside out.  <br>  <br>    And just use Frontline for fleas.

2P5WRadhaa	Most "reputations are gained by the recorded frequency of incidents with particular breeds and violence. To date the worst reputation belongs to the "Pit Bull" type dogs, as far as a particular breed is concerned; followed by Rottweilders, Dobermans, and German Shepherds. Here's some info on the Pitt Bulls:<br>  <br>  Pit Bull is a term commonly used to describe several types of dogs with similar physical characteristics. Its use in media is often vague and rarely descriptive of specific breeds. There are several physically similar breeds that are often termed "pit bull" in English speaking countries, including the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Perro de Presa Canario, Cane Corso, Dogo Argentino, Alano Espanol, Japanese Tosa, Dogue de Bordeaux, and Perro de Pelea. These breeds are usually not included by name in any Breed Specific Legislation (see below), but are sometimes included because of a broad definition and confusion as to what a pit bull actually is.<br>  <br>  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a study concerning deaths from canine attacks in 2000. [34] According to the study, between 1979 and 1998, one-third of all fatal dog attacks were caused by Pit Bull type dogs. The highest number of attacks (118) were by Pit Bull type dogs,<br>   <br>  The ordinance defined a pit bull as<br>  Any dog that is an American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, or any dog displaying a majority of physical traits of any one or more of the above breeds, or any dog exhibiting those distinguishing characteristics which substantially conform to the standards established by the American Kennel Club or United Kennel Club for any of the above breeds.<br>  <br>  News media stories of pit bull attacks involving disfiguring injury to humans and other animals, the latter very often also fatally, ranging in size from attacks on smaller non pitbull dogs to horses can be found globally. The pit bulls involved were not always loose and off the owner's property, but sometimes were inside the home of the owner, who, or a family member or visitor, was the victim of the aggression. Fatal pit bull attacks to children and adults have been reported by the English-language news media in the United States and United Kingdom.<br>  <br>  A study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medicine Association in September, 2000 reports that in the 20 years studied (1979 to 1998) "Pit-bull type dogs" and Rottweilers were involved in one half of approximately 300 dog bite related fatalities in the US[3]. Another study of American and Canadian dog bite related fatalities from September 1982 to November 2006 produced similar results, reporting that Pit bulls, Rottweilers, Presa Canarios and their mixes were responsible for 65% fatal dog attacks. [4] This study also noted: "Of the breeds most often involved in incidents of sufficient severity to be listed, pit bull terriers are noteworthy for attacking adults almost as frequently as children."<br>  <br>  A June assault left an East Baltimore woman hospitalized with bites and gashes on her head, neck, arms and legs. In April, a 10-year-old Towson boy spent more than two weeks in the hospital recovering from his injuries, and two Baltimore sheriff's deputies shot and killed a pit bull as it was attacking a 7-year-old girl.<br>  <br>  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released a report that showed pit bulls were responsible for more dog bite-related attacks than any other breed during a 20-year period<br>  <br>  In recent years, the dogs responsible for the bulk of the homicides are pit bulls and Rottweilers:<br>  <br>  "Studies indicate that pit bull-type dogs were involved in approximately a third of human DBRF (i.e., dog bite related fatalities) reported during the 12-year period from 1981 through1992, and Rottweilers were responsible for about half of human DBRF reported during the 4 years from 1993 through 1996....[T]he data indicate that Rottweilers and pit bull-type dogs accounted for 67% of human DBRF in the United States between 1997 and 1998. It is extremely unlikely that they accounted for anywhere near 60% of dogs in the United States during that same period and, thus, there appears to be a breed-specific problem with fatalities." (Sacks JJ, Sinclair L, Gilchrist J, Golab GC, Lockwood R. Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998. JAVMA 2000;217:836-840.)  <br>  <br>  The Clifton study of attacks from 1982 through 2006 produced similar results. According to Clifton study, pit bulls, Rottweilers, Presa Canarios and their mixes were responsible for 65% of the canine homicides that occurred during a period of 24 years in the USA. (Clifton, Dog attack deaths and maimings, U.S. & Canada, September 1982 to November 13, 2006; click here to read it.)<br>  <br>  Other breeds were also responsible for homicides, but to a much lesser extent. A 1997 study of dog bite fatalities in the years 1979 through|`|AA11992723	you can correlate every generation of a "dangerous" labeled breed (GSD, rottie, doberman, pit) with a movie and media exposure, and it is a CRIME how the media falsely depicted these innocent dogs, and not only shaped how others fear/hate them, but influenced how people blame the breed and not the abusive owners.<br>  <br>  Look at this disgusting FALSE portrayal:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogsbite.org/blog/uploaded_images/comic-fetch.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogsbite.org/blog/uploaded_im...</a>|`|PM23RDycaa	The media. Bad dogs get more press than good dogs.<br>  <br>  An APBT was shot and nearly killed protecting his owners from a homes invasion. They never ONCE mentioned the dog's breed but you could tell from the pictures he was either a pit or pit mix.<br>  <br>  BUT whenever a dog attack occurs its pitbull this and pitbull back. Even when the dog is not even close to being a pit, pix mix or even a breed mistaken for one. Retractions are hardly ever printed when the truth comes out.<br>  <br>  People take what the news says about these attacks as the gospel truth. <br>  <br>  Small dogs bite more people than larger dogs do but most are not reported to Animal Control and only in cases where an infant is involved and seriously injured does it make the news.<br>  <br>  All four top DANGEROUS dogs were military dogs at one point or another.

Its when ignorant people get them and breed them to fight that they become dangerous to people because they are not socialized with anyone but their owners and their family. These dogs have a horrible life and death, they are tied to heavy chains, fed raw food infused with steroids. And you think that won't make an aggressive dog. Of course it will but the authorities can see it as a dog to dog thing they see it as a breed thing. <br>  <br>  Look at the bully kutta, they are fought in India, but in their native land in pakistan they are used to guard. They were not bred to fight but ignorant people got ahold of them and now they happen to be one of the most dangerous breeds in the world. And it is a shame because they are a lovely breed. <br>  <br>  NO individual breed is dangerous its the owners that make them that way. <br>  <br>  Its a shame that guard dogs are getting targeting for doing what they were originally bred to do.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Well, I know that with the German Shepherd and Doberman Pinscher, they were known in WWII as the dogs used by the Germans in concentration camps and other horrible situations.  As in, I remember an old woman who talked about German Shepherds ripping people apart on a command from one of the Nazis, and the other people huddling and screaming as the person was ripped apart... horrible horrible things.  Dobermans were known as devil dogs.  <br>  <br>  Note, I LOVE German Shepherds and my current dog was picked from the litter because of his early resemblance to one, and I love Dobermans and want one eventually, love their elegant faces.  :)  I just know the reasons, you know?<br>  <br>  The Rottie I think looked enough like a Dobie that people confused them (I know, just remembering back in the day.)  Where I grew up, Rotties were only known as being... guard dogs really.  With pit bulls, it was stupid but in the 80's there was a drug bust in California and they found a bunch of pit bulls.  It was a huge bust, and the pictures were everywhere of them pulling out these tough looking brutish animals, and before you knew it everyone in a gang wanted one.  Or if you wanted to "appear" in a gang.  I know my brother, right before this influx of people wanting pits, wanted a Siberian Husky for it's tough wolf-look, that was what was in (he wasn't in a gang, but he liked looking tough I think.)  Pits weren't considered tough until that news-cast and subsequent ones.<br>  <br>  My dad still sees Pits as the sweetest dog out there, and we're watching for one that will be a good addition to our family.  My dad thinks their faces look like teddy bears and honestly doesn't understand why people crop their ears or act like they're tough or hard to handle.  It was the first type of dog he had as a boy.  To him, they're easy sweethearts.  I've worked with ex-fighters and rescues a lot, so I know the darker sides of their history, but also know the dog is a good type and I love them.  So pittie for us next.  I have kids.  What other dog is so wonderful with children?  :P|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Use this flow chart:<br>  <br>  Idiot-->Buys Dog-->Idiot Owns Dog-->Dog Bites Idiot-->Dog Is Now Dangerous<br>  <br>  See, in this very elaborate flow chart, you'll notice that the word "idiot" and "dog" are matched up entirely!<br>  <br>  Idiots make dogs dangerous. Idiots create dangerous "lines" of dogs, idiots then sell, breed, and buy dogs. Idiots then get bit in the face, pretend to be the victim, and the dog is now dangerous. <br>  <br>  Pretty easy to follow, if you ask me.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	The reputation has generally followed a series of attacks or maulings where a breed has injured or killed a person. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it is because the breed has been mis-trained as a guard or attack dog. Sometimes it is because the breed was created to fight and kill other dogs.|`|hHE6zRtaaa	what happened was people saw that like pit bulls bit people and they saw them as more vicious dogs because thats what they are bred for and they just made it in the news more then other dogs...<br>  <br>  like no ones gonna report that a weenier dog bit someone in the leg cause it doesnt catch peoples attention.|`|4sUqTjc8aa	Ignorance and bad humans. It's sad.|`|PP0ZsoR7aa	The problem lies with the owers of the dogs.<br>  <br>  A dog may have the 'fight' in them however if they are cared for and supervised (especially around children) then there should never be an issue.<br>  <br>  I am an owner of a 'dangerous dog'. I own 2 american staffys. While i have no doubt that they would protect my house if i was not there, i also feel complete at ease when my 4 year old neice thought it would be fun to jump off the couch and see if the dog could catch her. My Staff just looked at me with her big brown eyes as if 'mum are they going to go home soon i just want to cuddle'.<br>  <br>  My honest belief is that they are no more likely, in fact less likely to attack than a small dog (small dog syndrome) the only difference is that if they were to bite a child, or even an adult, due to their size and sheer power, they cause a hell of a lot more damage. <br>  <br>  When drug dealers and just plain idiots get their hands on a large dog, whether it be a staffy, german shepard, mastif etc and mistreat it, of course they are not going to know the correct way to act. <br>  <br>  In saying this, i dont believe every dog that has ever attacked has been mistreated but it is the responisibilty of the pet owner to warn local kids and parents that while their dogs are well behaved, that it is innappropriate for them enter your back yard when you are not there. It was only a few weeks ago that i had a couple of local kids ball come over the fence into my back yard. I let them into my back yard to get their ball and play with the dogs so they knoew they were friendly, however i made it very clear that they are not to go and get their ball if i am not home to let them into the back yard as the dogs are teratorial and while i know they will be fine if i am there, i dont know how they will act if i am not and 5 kids come waltzing into the back yard.<br>  <br>  The bad reputation is something that the owners of the dogs need to work on. If you are a breeder, interview your potential buyers, make sure that your dogs are going to loving homes where they wont be kept on a meter chain their whole life and will get the correct attention.<br>  <br>  Informing the community about your dog, and if it is a guard dog or a pet or you are going to breed is the best way of gettin rid of these 'bad reputations'.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|TblG3s89aa	Dogs such as german shepherd and pit bulls were great with families because of their loyalty and obedience. Pit bulls were even valued as good babysitters of royal families. These characteristics also made them good fighting dogs (pit dogs) because they do whatever they can to please their masters and if that means fight other dogs they do it. These breeds are also physically strong and athletic which makes them able to last longer in the ring. Another reason is physical appearance, for example bulldogs he lose skin on their neck which makes it hard to get to the vein and kill them and the folds on their face keeps the blood out of their eyes. This shows how ignorant people are considering dogs get a bad reputation for obeying their masters. It isn't even the dog fault but the fault of the owner who forces a dog to fight that justs wants to please|`|nwMBfgcdaa	Whenever a dog becomes popular, you get unscrupulous breeders that are just trying to make a buck.  They breed dogs with temperment issues that should never be able to pass those genes on.  GSDs are suffering greatly from this (as are labs and many other breeds).  <br>  Then there are the people who get these large dogs and do not properly train or socialize them.  GSDs, for one, tend to be protective. They need to be well socialized to unfamiliar situations.   Their protectiveness can also be mistaken for agression.  My GSD will bark when someone comes to the door.  As soon as I let you in, he knows by my reaction the person is ok, he becomes a big goof looking for an ear scratch.  People are still terrified of him.<br>  A GSD with bad nerves in the hands of someone who does not take the time to properly train and socialize is a ticking time bomb. A scared dog is much more likely to bite than an aggressive one.  <br>  Dogs have two reactions, fight or flight.  If the dog is in flight mode and cannot escape (on a leash, backed in a corner, etc), it has no other option but to bite.  <br>  <br>  Most "dangerous dogs" are large dogs.  They do more damage when they do bite then a smaller dog would.  It is still a popular misconception that dogs like Rottie and GSDs are the most common biters.  But when they do, you are probably more likely to hear about it due to the damage done.<br>  Then add in the people who get this dogs because they look intimidating or they have seen these as mean dogs or guard dogs on TV.  They want a mean dog and create one.  <br>  <br>  What most people don't realize is that every dog will bite.  It is the point at which they will bite that varies.  People say "get a lab".  Labs bite too.  There is some nature vs. nuture, but personally, I believe nuture has alot more to do with it.

The other thing you might want to look into is checking your water perameters and temperature. Ammonia can stress fish out and cause them to sit on the bottom or top of the tank.
m0k4DwHcaa	sounds like canine cognitive disorder which is like people Alzheimer's, but there is medication available that will make a big difference.   My spaniel was blind for many years but had the greatest sniffer.  He could get around anything.   Talk to your vet about him.|`|pGacaRuFaa	We had a cat like that. He stopped being able to get around the house, and started pooping wherever he was laying because he couldn't get to his litter box. 12 is a very old age for some breeds, and it sounds like he is getting too senile to remember where things are. Our pug had those same symptoms, but we didn't even get a choice in how he died. Someone left a gate open, and he wandered out into the road and got hit, not realizing where he was. It would be better to have your dog put down, than have him get frightened at no longer knowing where he is. It is a quality of life issue at this point.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	We did the same things with my childhood dog when he was younger, only for about a week before we put her down.  It is time.  Talk it over with your Vet.  She will have the best advice for you...but as another pet lover to another...I think it is time.|`|b660c3756d270b84da09073077f81249aa	Talk it over with your vet. They'll be able to help you decide if he's ready to go. |`|CZTq72Kfaa	the last thing that you want to do is jump to conclusions. the last response is horrible, dont listen to that guy, he obviously doesn't know Jack. Take him to a vet and let them discuss your options with you. and find out whats wrong beforehand. you would hate to put this baby to sleep if he just has some hearing loss and some bad eyes... thanks<br>  |`|lu1nNOS5aa	see what the vet says. if there's no chance of any improvement then i would say yes. the poor love wouldn't have any quality of life even though you love him to bits. if it was you, what would you prefer? |`|aog2QJKHaa	your own opinon <br>  it could be good for him or it would just be early demise.<br>  if u think hes suffering do what u think is right.<br>  like with my cat and his kidney failure.  we put him down. it was really sad =\.<br>  |`|N7m9GENfaa	My dog was a 12 year old cocker with the exact same problems. He was put to sleep on the 11th October 2008. Please take him to the vets, for his sake. |`|Ps7zn6fXaa	I am afraid so, sorry about it but i think it will be best.<br>  In the mean wile start looking for a new dog.|`|RedTRddIaa	That is one of those decisions that is ultimately up to YOU. Sorry. I know how you feel, we went through the exact same thing with our Lab last year. It was the hardest thing we ever had to go through with a pet. It eventually became very apparent he was just suffering and we did not want that. We had the vet come out to our property....she came out on the back 40 next to the pond ( Spike's favorite place ) and we sat under our big walnut tree and said goodbye. I am still hurt, as a matter of fact I am tearing up, and it was not an easy decision. I urge you to think of his quality of life and pain level. As long as you think he is doing ok......you will know when the time comes. Also, our other Lab Olive just passed quietly in her sleep at the age of 12.....she had been experiencing the same things. Somehow that was easier. My prayers are with you and your beloved companion. God Bless.|`|0fuF2sHbaa	I agree that you should have the vet check him over and see if the recent change isn't treatable.<br>  <br>  Personally I believe that the time to let them go is when they have no pleasures left in life anymore. |`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	The best thing to do is have the vet check him over.
