20090131170802AAii5YJ	Pets;Horses	What type of job should I get?	I want to get a horse-related job, but I'm not great at school, and I'm not planning on going to college right after I graduate. So are there any good jobs I can get without a degree?      I'm 18 and I've been riding for almost 13 years. I rode saddleseat for the first 10 years, and had a lesson once or twice a week for the entire 10 years. I owned and showed 3 horses then, but not at the same time. The first two were crazies, but the third one was a good horse.      The past 3 years I've just been trail riding. I have my mare, who I got just after her third birthday and taught her pretty much everything she knows except how to allow a rider on her back. And then I have my friend's gelding. She lives in California, so I pretty much free lease him. He was abused before she got him, and was absolutely nuts. He's made a LOT of progress, and I can ride him tackless now.      I'm not sure what else to say about my abilities. I know a lot about the care of horses, but not a lot about their health. I can walk, trot, canter, gallop, jump, and I can do it bareback. I don't think that's what makes you a good rider though.      So what job do you think would be best for me? And would anyone even hire an 18-year-old? I graduate in May, but I go to school online so I'm pretty flexible. I need to find a job this summer.

20090131180548AAPNJEf	Pets;Dogs	How to stop a crying puppy?	i recently asked a similar question as im about to ask, but unfortunately people got the wrong end of the stick with my wording so i will try again. I have recently got a puppy, shes 8 weeks old. i allow her to come inside and be with my young son and i, but when it comes time to feed/ bath my son i put her out side as she just gets in the way at times. shes not just kept outside and forgot about, i have no issue with her being inside sometimes but she will be a outside dog majority of the time. when i put her outside weather she can see  me or not she yelps. if i bring her inside and leave her in a different room she yelps. how can i help her stop yelping every time shes left alone without her having to be attached to me 24/7? i also live in AUSTRALIA and its summer here so its not cold for her to be outside. she has shade and water.

20090131175612AAHQ6Dy	Pets;Horses	What causes a horse's hoof wall to crack?	I was riding a horse that I'm training for someone else and I was doing some 10 meter canter circles to get him to sit and then some jumping.  Nothing too hard, but still challenging for him.  He was wearing overreach boots and polos.  When I took the overreach boot off his right foot, there was blood right above the hoof on the fur, and I couldn't find out where it was coming from.  So I just cleaned his foot and sprayed it with the red peppermint smelling stuff (I forgot what it's called, hehe), and left it alone.  Unfortunately, I was kicked by a pony later on that day and haven't been out to check on his foot in five days, but his owner called and told me the farrier came out and said his hoof wall is cracked and that he's due for shoes.  His feet are really wide and really long and he has rubber flooring.  How can horses hooves crack?  Is it from vigorous workouts or just semi-long feet?

20090131145419AA7HEd6	Pets;Cats	How much should I feed my kitten?	I have a 8 month old kitten who weighs around 11lbs. He is 21in long (from head to right before his tail) and 17in tall (from feet to head). Some of my friends say he is pretty big for a kitten, but I don't know since he is my first pet and I don't know much about cats. He is not fat though, in fact most of the same friends say he looks a little too skinny. Is he really big for a kitten? His foster family told me he might be a big cat since his paws were large as a newborn kitten. This is weird since he was supposedly abandoned by his mother for being the "runt" of the litter...       Now I need to know if I am feeding him enough because I don't want him to starve.  I can't tell because he never whines for food or anything. He's pretty quiet (rarely meows except to greet me when I come home), so if he is hungry I don't know. He is also really active. I feed him 3x a day. Each meal I feed him 1/4 cup of dry food mixed with 1/6 of a canned cat food (about a tbsp). What do you think? Am I feeding him enough, too much, or too little?      Thanks!

I just found this forum a couple of days ago, and until today, I really enjoyed reading and answering everyone's questions.That was until I came across an answer that was just rude and hateful that I know was directed at me, even though it wasn't my question to begin with.This guy just bashed everyone who wants to breed their dogs in order to have more pets to love and take care of.I see absoloutely nothing wrong with allowing my dog to have pups,for the sole intent of me and the male dog's owners wanting more dogs of the same breed. It makes much more sense to breed my own AKC registered female with another AKC registered male of the exact same breed and give their pups a home with us than to spend 100's of dollars on pups that I don't know anything about or how well they were taken care of.ALL of my dog's pups already had homes BEFORE we decided to breed her. And, as for the comment that I think my dog is the most special in the world? YES I DO!My pets are my BABIES!So leave us alone

We play with him plenty during the day.  I put toys in there with him.  I bought a bark collar, but when we put it on him and he barked, when it shocked him he screamed like it was hurting him, and that worried me so I removed it, but I still have it.

Also he doesn't chirp much when i am around not like my sisters does {she has had hers 3 weeks longer then me}. I spend time with him and talk but he won't chirp till he gets outside. Also he goes nuts by sliding down the cage bars head first then climbs back and does it all again.... Is any of this normal and is he okay? Or am i just a concerned pet owner?

20070818213446AATFmpD	Pets;Dogs	Has anyone else had to make the hard decision of putting their dog down?	We have had our pitbull for almost 7 years.  Great dog. Friendly and loving!He was our baby. My inlaw's had rescued him. He stayed with our inlaws for months at a time throughout the years and absolutely loved them. Over the course of the years he has gotten into 2 fights with their dog. A few months ago, he went to stay with my inlaw because we were in the transition of moving to another state.  After almost 2 years of peace with their dog last month he suddenly attacked their dog pretty badly.  After about 2 minutes or so they were able to be separated.  This past week, the dogs found themselves face to face again and my pit snapped and attacked him again..very badly.  He did not want to let go and ended up biting my in-law who was trying to break it up.  My inlaws were very upset with the attack and fearful that my daughter could be injured if our pit decided to snap again.  We made the decision to put himdown.  My heart still aches.  And I hope I made the right decision in the end.

We think he had a twisted swim bladder. Also he has a clamped dorsal fin. I keep the tank clean with a filter and bubble stone, and feed him sinking pellets 2-3 times a day. Every time i change the tank I add some drops of stress coat to help, but I don't think it does anything. I have tried fasting him, and feeding him frozen peas.....nothing works. How can I make him swim normal again and relieve stress?      here are some pictures of him.....he always floats at the upper right hand corner and it looks like he is dead.....by the way this is a 10 gallon tank      Thanks!!!          http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...        http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...        http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...        http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...

They are a chocolate brown oranda and he can swim around perfectly fine right side up but sometimes I'll look at the tank and he's is floating around the top upside down. If he can swim around perfectly fine does this just means he's doing it for fun? Or is he sick?

After a few weeks we separated them into boys and girls but the runt, which we thought was a boy, has turned out to be a girl and is now pregnant. So should we be concerned that the runt of the litter is pregnant? Also the runts parents were brother and sister and now she has been impregnated by her brother so is this level of inbreeding going to cause further problems? Thanks in advance for your help
