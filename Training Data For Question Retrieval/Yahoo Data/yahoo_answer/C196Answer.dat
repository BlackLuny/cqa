t1fx6kXcaa	Yes, I''m generalising but<br>  Seems a lot from the US on YA do not get sarcasm. Do not get humour. Which I don't get.<br>  I'm an Aussie. A lot of Americans don't "get" Aussie sense of humour or sarcasm either. <br>  No wonder I love Aussie and British comedy and generally can't stand the boring, predictable US comedies I see so much off on TV. There are exceptions of course....<br>  But for the most part, many Americans seem to be either gullible or just completely oblivious to sarcastic humour.|`|XK6k2UAIaa	Just Americans hun? It's all based on the person not where they are from. People do get sarcasm but things like that question is just stupid. It was a waste of Y/A answers space. It's not about getting or not getting sarcasm. People are just giving this person truthful answers to the question. Yes maybe they are taking it a little to serious but on here you never know. You can't see a person face to face so it's really hard to know whether they are being serious or not. I just personally wish people would stop posting stupid crap like that. That's not what this site was meant for. So forgive people if they too seem a little annoyed.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I'm American and if I were a lot older, I would have invented sarcasm. My sense of humor rivals that of Darlene from the TV show Roseanne.<br>  <br>  It's hard to tell if someones being sarcastic or serious through a computer screen, though. And yes, there are people who are stupid enough to do something like that to their kids for a stupid reason. I would know, my mom has grounded me because my dad got drunk while watching us while she was at bingo...|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I do happen to get sarcasm, thanks.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i don't think its fair to categorize all Americans together. i personally live for sarcasm :) but some people on here are strange and sometimes its hard to know if they are kidding or not. like the 14 yr old who wants a baby, comeon. so i think online, its hard to get sarcasm across the right way. when 10 people read a sentence, they are gonna get 10 different meanings from it.|`|mFInMKSaaa	Monty Python is the best.

But the couple that do swear I am the "funniest mother-****** alive" but, in general I do agree|`|l9ab36z4aa	Some don't get our sarcasm. It funny how they took that question seriously. Many people outside Britain don't get sarcasm because they haven't been exposed to it.|`|zDYphWwvaa	sarcasm is not easily understood in writing and there are a lot of weird people who would really ask a question like that!|`|kIsSYp8uaa	I dont think they get it|`|kaqPSgTVaa	My friends certainly do...Maybe we aren't real Americans! Oh no!<br>  <br>  LOL|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Er, most people who answered that got it was a fake question. It wasn't very funny anyway.<br>  <br>  Americans are behind in humour in some ways I think :-p (look at their sitcoms vs British ones, sorry but it's true) but I don't think for sarcasm<br>  <br>  Harriet

wNtW1hXLaa	the whole experience fades into the background when the baby comes out and they put your baby onto your chest for the first time. you are just in awe of them as the midwife or doctor is delivering the placenta and tending to any stiches. i didn't have an epidural so i was feeling everything and i didnt tear either. The adrenaline and hormones pumping through your body and the thrill of meeting your baby allow you to get through it. i just focused on my baby. i was just so relieved that it was all over. At that point you know you are through the worst. You do experience some pain and discomfort afterwards and in the coming weeks but it is all so worth it. like peeing for the first time stings, you can have little contraction like feelings when you are breast feeding which is good as it is helping the uterus go back to normal size, swelling in the feet for up to a week after, i bled heavily for 3 weeks after etc etc. 3 months down the track, i feel like everything is back to normal except for my tummy which needs a lot of work!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You get such a rush of adrenaline that you usually don't notice any pain after wards...Not for a while at least. :)|`|PIJkva60aa	it usually stops unless you tore or somehtingg.<br>  but it will hurt like hours afterwards.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	pretty much so. you still have a few contractions afterwords to expell the placenta, but you will not notice them, its no where near the same kinda contractions. if your have an episiomoty then you will be a little more uncomfortable afterwords, but i wouldn't say painful. heck after having a baby, you have a new respect for pain, things that bothered you before arn't as bad:)|`|Q8tf4B5taa	yes it does once the baby and afterbirth are out it just aches a bit.|`|ob9oJpKbaa	I had the epedural! Take the drugs & you'll feel nothing!|`|YtRB9Mhtaa	The worst pain is with the crowning (when the head comes out), but after the baby is born there is pain as well.  Sometimes, there is attached placenta left in the womb that must be scrapped out.  Other times, there are tears that must be stitched up.  For births #2, 3, 4, and on, women often have afterbirth cramping when the uterus contracts to go back to normal size; these get worse with each birth.  As with all things in labor, the amount of pain afterward is unique to that specific birth.
YtRB9Mhtaa	Try getting a giant sized nursing pillow (shaped like a big C).  Not only will you be able to use it after the birth if you nurse, but it wraps around your belly and can be tucked beneath your knees keeping you stable.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	use a pillow shaped like a V and when u lay sideways knees bent line the pillow up with the V shape of ur legs. i did that for my sciatic pain and it worked wonders i now sleep better :)<br>  if only i could do something for the pain in my butt (literally) from baby dropping so early!! its also hurtin my back|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I LIVE for my body pillow. I'm only 15 weeks pregnant and I've been using it since week 7. So much is going on in your hips from early on that hip pain is common. It put one leg under the body pillow, the other on top. It relieves a lot of pressure. I sleep so much better.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	I think, as previous comments have said, they are in the shape of a C. It might just be easier to get several full size body pillows though, Walmart sells some super fluffy ones for like 10 bucks a pop, I think. There is pregnancy pillows out there, similar to a full body pillow.  My mother had gotten me one at a yard sale. I think Babies R Us might carry them, but it sounds like something you would get some use out of. I didn't use it myself, I actually sort of forgot about it. I prefer a regular full size body pillow between my legs (and sometimes two more on both sides of my body, so when I roll over I have more cushion).

Wednesdays are my PJ day. my 16 month old and i are lazy all day. as long as they arn't watchin tv all day and do something constructive, i can't imagine it being an issue. sit on the floor and color with them, make sure they have enough toys to keep them occupied, sometimes its good to not entertain them, so they learn to do this on their own. maybe keep special toys for that day so they arn;t bored with them when you want them to play alone. :)|`|wNtW1hXLaa	Not at all! You deserve a day of rest and it sounds like you are doing everything you possibly can for them. they are well loved. it is a good chance for them to catch up on some rest too. life can be so fast paced so it is good to teach them to relax a little bit and enjoy the simple things in life.|`|yxtMLgN8aa	Well I'm not a mom yet, but I won't worry if my son doesn't play outside everday.

YtRB9Mhtaa	Up to a point, you will just pee out any excess Vitamin C you take, but after that you will get diarrhea.  It's not life-threatening, but if you get diarrhea, you'll know you can't take the tablet in addition to your multivitamin.  <br>  <br>  The actual number of milligrams to induce diarrhea varies by person and their diet.  Vegans seem to be the most sensitive.  People who eat lots of meat and refined foods can get away with much higher doses!  So try it, see how you feel, your body will let you know.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	you can but your multivit should have vitamin c...maybe try a different brand. if you take to many vitamins it can make your belly hurt but mostly you just pee them out, for example if you drink three glasses of orange juice and take a vitamin c you dont get anymore than your body needs because its expelled after your body takes all it wants.|`|5It6FLCBaa	it shouldnt be a problem but consult ur doctor anyway|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It shouldn't be a problem.

One spontaneously and the other induced.  The bub that came at 36 weeks spontaneously had an attempt at 32 weeks that was stopped but i just had a feeling she was never far from coming after 32 weeks. It's that motherly instinct i think!!!

I'm not sure if your 4yo would be interested in car races.<br>  These are the games my younger children have on the cellphones.|`|KlWWh3fgaa	If she has a cell phone at 4, I would assume she must have a games console. Why not get her Big Brain Academy for the DS lite or the Wii? It's a lot more productive than a four year old having a cell phone for the sole purpose of playing games to develop her brain which, doesn't make sense !

Get her a Leapfrog Leapster for games.<br>  <br>  I don't like her having a cell either... but I know your "purpose" for it. Frankly they have special phones for kids that have just a few numbers programmed in and it can only receive certain numbers. If you feel she "needs" one that is what she sould have.|`|9YRH9LXpaa	A cellphone alone isn't appropriate for a child under the age of 13. You should let her brain grow by itself, let her sort it out. While you're working she should be at playschool with other kids.

He would learn the same if you had him out counting sticks or playing blocks--using a puzzle or singing songs. <br>  I wish people could just be normal...a 4 year old with a cell phone sounds just crazy to me....there is a thing called productive play. If you were to take some parenting courses you would learn that children develope best when you support their normal* growing process which mean letting him play with toys that are age appropriate. A cell phone is in and about the 13-16 age range....do you not see the dramatic gap...age 4 is an important age and here you are slapping technology into his hands---here honey go play!<br>  <br>  Sorry I dont know any games...I do not promote my children starring at a tiny screen for hours at a time.

Maybe she's having kittens|`|284rNMQ9aa	This is not unusual during pregnancy...Although pregnancy is a physiological phenomenon, it also encompasses a vast number of physical, mental and emotional changes. The emotional and behavioural changes may be brought about by the hormonal changes that occur in the female body during pregnancy. What your wife is feeling is quite normal. During these emotional episodes, I would advise you to try and make her stay calm. Also, she should try to meditate or talk to someone close to you about your feelings... try to keep the dogs away from her...take her somewhere peacefully...|`|5D4T6h7waa	yea that is a little off... lol. when i got pregnant i was a mental case myself. but i was just mean-i didn't act like an animal.

mSJwKrQIaa	I LOVE Sheyenna Faith, it's cute and sweet and very beautiful. Mercedes I'm not so crazy about, but it flows nicely with Grace and the spelling makes it better. Beau Jarid, i like the first name, not so much the second- not sure why :S. Madden James I ADORE. It's cute, handsome and original. (:<br>  All four names go together, but their not all matchy - i like the fact that they dont start with the same letter and would have different initials.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

Sheyanna Faith is pretty as well.. <br>  <br>  As for the other two.. they would not be my choice or my taste in human baby names.|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Sheyenna Faith: I think the pronounciation Shy-Anna is better, in which case she should spell it Shianna/Shyanna.<br>  <br>  Mersaydees Grace: If she's going to call it Mercedes, she should spell it Mercedes. It'll be too difficult for the child to spell it this way. I know a girl called Mercedes, and she's really nice.<br>  <br>  Beau Jarid: I know Beau is a boy's name, but it's more commonly used for girls now. A more popular boy's name is Bae.

tLGbtmGsaa	Yes it is possible.   If you don't want her to get pregnant then use protection.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	More than likely no but stranger things have happened. Precum contains sperm sometimes.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	no not if he doesn't *** into your vagina it is not more then likely but it maybe possible from precum that she may become pregnant.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	yes she can if there was any *** or precum aswell, its very unlikely though, just use protection next time.|`|5D4T6h7waa	the clear sticky stuff can have sperm in it. if YOU know what I mean.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	any penetration can cause pregnancy|`|hNyedM9caa	If you're seriously asking this question, then there probably shouldn't be any poking of things. <br>  However, when a guy has an erection, pre-*** may be present (more often than none), so there is always a chance. Use an effective means of contraception when that time comes and there is minimal chance of pregnancy. Condoms/birth control pill are the most common. <br>  The only 100% way to avoid an unwanted pregnancy is abstinence. And, like I said previously, it might be a good idea...<br>  Good luck :)|`|dbyJhlruaa	yes it possibly be especially when the girl is fertile. I knew some friends who got pregnant with just one poke. So if you dont want to get preganant always use a contraceptive. Abstinence is a 100 percent...LOL|`|C53UlCdaaa	yes you can. sometimes it takes just the once.|`|TbMBaKw3aa	depends if you ejaculate while you're poking inside her or not
jUneJXEIaa	I had my son when I was 19, looking back now I think I was too young but I wouldn't change it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Wait. You have soo much time. Go to college, live your lives outside of your parents home's for a few years. WAIT. You have all the time in the world.|`|Fm0acPPlaa	I'm 18 and I just found out that I'm pregnant today. Yes, I believe I am too young but there is nothing I can do about it now since my female instincts make me already love and care for my baby, so abortion or adoption isn't an answer for me. <br>  If I could help it, I would have waited until I was 22. <br>  18 is too young.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	Wait. Travel. Go to School. <br>  Find a fun way to make a living.<br>  Then, get married and make a family.<br>  <br>  Take it from people who are trying to support themselves without some training or college. It's no fun. Add a baby, and you will really be broke. And you won't be able to go out when you do reach drinking age. You will be too busy with making money and taking care of your child. You will maybe have to live with people you won't like. You may only be able to afford to live in neighborhoods where people break in and take your stuff. You probably won't be able to afford all the nice things that you have now. Meanwhile, your friends will be off at college, buying cars and clothes. Your relationship will suffer because of the strain of not having enough money. Especially because one of you will need to stay home to take care of the baby. Don't even think of day care. #1, you won't be able to afford it. #2, this is YOUR child, and you should be the ones to raise it, not some stranger or someone who is done raising their kids and needs a rest<br>  <br>  Ask yourselves why you want a baby now. Is it because someone can't think of what else to do after high school? Is it because someone wants a baby, because babies never leave and will always love you? Is it because someone thinks the baby will keep the two of you together? Or ????<br>  <br>  If you are not ready to make a commitment to each other, and can't support a child, don't have a child. It's a lifelong job and not to be taken lightly.<br>  <br>  You show great maturity in asking this question, and you are RIGHT, it's too soon.|`|ZZakBjiNaa	im 15 (well i am next wednesday) and i think i'm 4 weeks and 3 days.<br>  i'm keeping mine, obviously i didn't plan it but i'm against abortion.<br>  <br>  i think yeah we are young to have kids but that still doesn't make us bad parents.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	i personally think its too young, i would live you life a little first.
OJFz0LBZaa	coming off the pill can do some funny things to your body, many times i thought i was pregnant after stopping the pill, but the symptoms could also be pregnancy as a number of woman fall pregnant straight away, i would leave it till next week and do a test, also you don't have to have all the classic symptoms to be pregnant i never had any till i was 7/8 weeks pregnant apart from a few mild cramps around a week before missed period and more discharge, good luck when you test x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Wait a week and test.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	take a pregnancy test that tells you 6 days before your ment to be on<br>  <br>  first response :)|`|MAdFGBN8aa	Like the others have said honey the only way to know is to do a test.

So you would be doing yourself a favour by doing a test and knowing for sure.|`|x9cIEeDeaa	chances are you're probably preggo...tasting metal is a symptom of pregnancy and ur nipples don't necessairly have to get darker right away but then again every pregnancy is different so take a test and/or see yur doc!|`|yxtMLgN8aa	I'm not sure either.

But it varies slightly from child to child. By the time your little one is 2 years old, he needs to begin regular visits to a Dentist. I'm sure you know this anyway.  Get a soft infants toothbrush & start getting him accustomed to having someone's hand in his mouth. Also you can use a washcloth to clean his teeth. Keeping a baby's teeth (especially formula fed babies)  clean will reduce the plaque build-up on the gums, therefore making his teething process much more tolerable. <br>  Ora-gel has a neat little device made of rubber with nubs that you can rub his gums with while applying the gel. My grandson enjoyed it!  This thing comes with Ora-Gel. You seem to be a terrific mom, btw!!|`|AXWTVb3kaa	The growth of baby teeth is only completed at the age of 4, when the roots of all the erupted teeth are fully formed. <br>  The Central Incisor and Lateral Incisor { the front upper and lower teeth}eruption age is 7-9 months and the root gets fully formed between 20-22months. But this can vary considerably from child to child. Hope the info helps.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	My son has two teeth and one is fully in at about 1/4 in the other came a month ago and is also as big. They don't get very big...they are only the baby teeth after all.|`|50lIaC8zaa	My LO had her first 2 teeth at 4 months and i think they have come in fully but her top ones which she got at 6 months still don't look like they have come through fully as they are quite small!? Im not really sure how long it takes for them to come fully in, i suppose length of time and size of teeth differ from baby to baby.

(: Sweet, girly and totaly adorable. - Other spellings i quite like are Caitlyn, Kaetlyn.<br>  Connie - (7/10) I know a girl called Connie and she hates her name, she was made fun of and called 'Connie the Cow'. But it is cute, short and sweet. <br>  Loraine - (6/10) As with Laurine, Loraine sounds slightly old. But it is sweet and traditional.<br>  Carmen - (8/10) I think it's original, cute and appealing. (:<br>  Alyson - (9/10) I love the name Alyson, there's cute nicknames, it's not too long, and not too short. And it's adorable, sweet and feminine without sounding too cutesy or old-fashioned.

mSJwKrQIaa	Okay.. Urmm Here's a list of ratings and opinions. (= :<br>  <br>  Scarlett Mia - (9/10) I love both names. Original, and sweet.<br>  Grace Noelle - (10/10) I love the name Grace, it cute and pretty, and combined with Noelle it sounds completely adorable!<br>  Chasey Noelle - (9/10) Original and quirky, Chase is manly, but by adding the Y at then end it makes the name sound pretty and girly. (:<br>  Murphy Claire - (10/10) I love that you're using Murphy for a girl, because somehow, it works. Also combined with Claire it makes is sound feminine and sweet. I think this names is great!<br>  Ashlynn Grace - (6/10) I'm not a big fan of the name Ashlynn, not sure why. But it's better when put with Grace, as it flows nicely.<br>  <br>  Sean Finley - (10/10) It's cute, handsome and totally adorable! (:<br>  Oliver Evan - (5/10) I don't really like the name Oliver, and combined with Evan, there's just too many V's. Plus - To me - It sounds slightly old fashioned.<br>  Avery Covell - (9/10) I love both names! Cute, original, unique and handsome. The names flow nicely together, but aren't too matchy, i like that. (:<br>  Emerson Zane / Zane Emerson - (8/10) I prefer Emmerson Zane, it flows nicer and it sounds sooo cute! It's masculine, original yet sweet.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.<br>  <br>  Yasmine <3 <br>  <br>  BTW - Congratulations (:|`|aAJd36TVaa	Scarlett Mia 7/10<br>  Grace Noelle 10/10<br>  Chasey Noelle 4/10<br>  Murphy Claire 5/10<br>  Ashlynn Grace 8/10<br>  <br>  Sean Finley 10/10<br>  Oliver Evan 8/10<br>  Avery Covell "Cuv-all" 6/10 <br>  Sean Mattius 4/10<br>  Emerson Zane 7/10<br>  Zane Emerson 5/10<br>  <br>  <br>  My favourites are Grace Noelle + Sean Finley, really cute :)|`|4MNTEh77aa	Scarlett Mia<br>  Zane Emerson<br>  They are my picks out of the ones you'v given.<br>  I would like the name Chase not Chasey but for a boy instead of Chasey for a girl.|`|SZfLNbHFaa	Scarlett Mia&Sean Finley|`|DUeCxgpOaa	Scarlett Mia and Sean Finley|`|nidY4l0vaa	Ashlynn grace   and  emerson zane|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	I like Ashlynn Grace and Zane Emerson.|`|AA11080680	Hi I really like the name Grace Noelle and she can be called Gracie.<br>  Zane Emerson sounds very masculine.

yjNRhUXGaa	This is hard question to answer, but i know how you feel trust me i went through the same thing.<br>  <br>  Now though i don't care what people think ad it comes with age and experience. <br>  <br>  Don't give up on yourself and i think on way to help is to see that everyone is diverse (different) and individual. And we all have negatives and positives. I know it sounds mean or weird but to yourself look at people and their negative look for what they truly are but don't tell them to their face eep it to yourself! <br>  <br>  You will see that everyone is different and why shouldn't you be too? Your aloud to be! and look up keep your grade and work good and it will give you true fulfilment.<br>  <br>  IT IS BEST NOT TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF ABOUT BEING DIFFERENT. <br>  <br>  JUST ACCEPT IT! EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT FROM EACH REMEBER THAT!<br>  <br>  <br>  Also just get on with it the only person that matters is you! throughout life in the end you are you and you have only your mind to keep you company.<br>  <br>  Good luck and fight for you not anyone els!|`|gRdSdeHsaa	It's crazy! I thought i was the only one feeling this way. I am 13 also, so i know how you're feeling. For me to get out of this problem i usually try to do something that makes me feel happy! It sometimes works for me so maybe you should try it. And trust me .. no one is ever alone in the world(:<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Calley made some great points.<br>  <br>  I had a few of the same thoughts as you do when i was in school (only just graduated last year so school wasnt that long ago!) But there was just one stage where i completely snapped and got into this crazy train of thought that i couldnt cope, my friends didnt think i was good enough, people were judging me for no reason and i just couldnt handle the pressure of my own thoughts.<br>  <br>  So i actually went and seen our school councilor, and it was probably one of the best decisions i made. Now i know some people think 'HA! councilor, how lame can you get!' I thought the same thing and i only thought they were there to help with the out of control students, the depressed ones so on and so forth - not someone like me who was just having a week where she felt down on herself. I also thought if people see a person like me, someone who was down to earth, happy go lucky, friends with everyone - going into a councilors room, they'll make fun of me, judge me etc. But i took the leap anyway.. I went and seen the school councilor and at first i felt very out of my comfort zone, i was sitting in a room with this complete stranger who was expecting me to open up to them out of no where about what was going on, i felt asthough they were judging me, i felt that they would think what my problem was was stupid. Than i thought, well these people are trained to deal with all these types of problems, what i tell them is confidential - they cant tell anyone else, they have no right. They cant judge me - they arent allowed to judge.. thinking about that made me feel very at ease and i opened upto the councilor like they were my best friend. I can honestly say if it wasnt for that councilor being there and listening to all the thigns i had to say, no matter how stupid they were, i would still be a very down on myself person. But thanks to them, i went back to being the happy go lucky person i was before than.<br>  <br>  Im not saying you MUST go and see your guidance councilor school councilor whoever. But if you arent scared to try it than go and try it. Like i said at first it is a little nerve racking, but they make you feel completely at ease, they dont force you to say anything - they give you all the time you need. And they will understand you no matter how stupid you think your problem may be, or how lame you think your problem may be. If you are willing to talk to them, trust them than they will give you all the necessary information you need to know about how to deal with your train of thoughts - such as people thinking you are weird. They're there if you just need someone to say hello to and have a general chat to, they're there if you need a shoulder to cry on, ANYTHING. They arent just there to deal with people who have servere problems in life.|`|tSKBsbIyaa	First of all, you should stop thinking that you have any problem.<br>  Why do you think that you feel alone, you don't have good friends to hang out with, or they do not consider you. <br>  You need not think what people are thinking about you.<br>  Tell me, for how long do you think in a day, about a classmate seating next you in your class? For  min.? for an hour? or for entire day. <br>  People do not have Time to think about others. May it be your best pal or even siblings. Every body have their own business to do in life. Some or other priority. <br>  You too should have some goal, to look up to. A dream to achieve. And put efforts for that. that's it. This is happening because you have time to think about people around you.<br>  And one think believe me, a person who is your true friend, who loves you will never let you down or let you cry. And the one who does, doesn't deserve your attention.<br>  So chuck it up, and enjoy your life. Do what yo like.. be happy.<br>  Things automatically will change.<br>  tell me how much do you like yourself??|`|Jo8nlGVsaa	Most people your age go through the same thing.

igbdywwVaa	I could talk forever about this so I'll try and keep it short. <br>  <br>  I had a c-section with my first. She was breech. Now, I'm being forced to have a repeat IF I stay with my OB of 12 years. I may or may NOT need another c-section. Basically it comes down to risks of lawsuits. <br>  <br>  After we discussed my wishes of trying for a VBAC with my OB, she said the hospital had been sued and so she and her colleagues have decided that they will not do a vbac (but she'll be happy to give me names of docs who will). She said that there is only a 1% risk of uterine rupture. Very little risk of death to the mother. BUT a higher risk of problems with the child. That's what happened with the malpractice suit...the child ended up with long term problems. But if it was as she said it was, the mother was ridiculous and should have never won the suit. Supposedly the woman refused to have a c-section even after the baby went into distress????<br>  <br>  In your case (and could be mine), at your stage in the pregnancy, they may have decided that the baby is too big for you to deliver vaginally so they aren't even going to try (understandable). BUT, could be because some hospitals are not allowing midwives to perform VBAC's because of their policies. <br>  <br>  There are risks with c-sections. Not only did I feel I missed a lot of those first moments (and hours+) with my baby, but it's a MAJOR surgery and very painful. I've never felt like I gave birth...I just had a baby. <br>  <br>  A friend of mine just had her 2nd last week (at my birthing hospital). Apparently she tried a vbac but the baby was too big (both of her babies were over 8#'s). However, mom and dad disagreed on the doctor's actual support of her trying for a vbac- I asked because I was shocked that they let her try! I saw new mom and dad early that evening (baby was born at 9:45am) and mom had yet to see her baby girl. Baby had fluid in her lungs (which is normally expelled in vaginal births) so she was in the NICU on oxygen for a few more hours. Mom was in too much pain to go to the NICU. Ultimately, an otherwise healthy baby had to stay in the NICU for 7 days.  <br>  <br>  If it's absolutely necessary, I'm fine with having another c-section. But if all the stars are aligned and I can do it, but I can't because of high insurance costs and doctors and hospitals afraid of malpractice lawsuits, it's sad that I wouldn't get the chance to labor and deliver. <br>  <br>  (Sorry, I know this is a touchy subject and I got a little long winded). I wish you the very best with the birth of your new baby! Congratulations!|`|2JiRVr6Jaa	The same thing is happening with me. I am almost 23 weeks pregnant. With my first pregnancy I went into preterm labor (the pregnancy didn't end well) and the doctor had to do an emergency  vertical hysterotomy. Basically, they cut into the contraction (muscles) portion of my uterus. I am scheduled to have a c-section at 37 weeks due to the increased risk of a placental abruption or uterine tear, and profuse bleeding. If the doctor thinks it's safe to do the c-section then I'm sure he/she has a good reason for it. Good luck and congrats! I hope everything goes well for you!|`|mQg5SVQXaa	I don't know why, but I've heard that, too, so go ahead and schedule a C-section so the doctors can be prepared, but when you go into labor, it might be OK to give birth naturally, but it is best to be prepared for a C-section.|`|5O0HnfQaaa	i think its due to the first one that you had, could have problems not being able to progress in the labor|`|kaqPSgTVaa	She knows your medical history more than we do. It can be very risky to do vaginal birth after c section. Talk to her and ask her why. She's going to be able to give you the real answer.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	sometimes a woman can try a VBAC (vaginal broth after a c section) but sometimes the can't because going into labor and pushing could rupture the uterus because of the healed incision from before. This is happening to my friend too...and they do it 2 weeks early to avoid you going into labor and causing problems.|`|jrVlzffeaa	Just because you can a c-section with your first doesn't necessarily mean that you need or should have on with your second baby, my mum had an emergency c-section with my older brother and she said they tried to bully her into having a c-section with me but she refused and all went well, same as with my younger brother. however if there is a medical problem then maybe it's not possible for yo to give birth naturally. Best thing to do is write a list of you worries/concerns/questions and ask your midwife next time you see her. Good luck Xx|`|qUImmXXEaa	Hey, <br>  <br>  With my first baby i had a planned c-section because i had an appendiscites (yeh i dont know how to spell that one) and my dr schedualed it for 2weeks before my due date so i wouldnt go into labour naturally. <br>  <br>  Now my baby is 15months and i'm 8weeks pregnant with no2 and i've already told my dr i want another c-section!!! And two weeks earlier too!!!<br>  <br>  You do whatever you feel comfortable with but i think 'jacobs mom' is right with her answer!!! <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|KIZVWREHaa	Once you have a c section you always have to . It is just the way it works with the uterus and scare tissue .|`|O3EtP4vOaa	When you have a c-sec and then have a natural birth you have an increase risk that you can rupture the uterus, which would then lear to a hysterectomy, blood loss, and possibly death.  This is increased when the pregnancies are close together.  Also if you had a large baby that you were unable to deliver the first time they might want to take you earlier so the baby do not get to large for your pelvic structure, they may also be preventing you from going into labor and contracting your uterus and then risking a rupture.  Go get a second opinion from a gyne if you are concerned.
KPSQcnwbaa	if you go chemist they have tests which can tell you a day after you may have conceived so you can definitely get one nowthat will tell you and the sooner you know the better so you have options hope you get the answer you want|`|38842f8559a928305671fc9066bef276aa	you pregnant, homedawg|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If your period is stil 12 days out it's more likely that you are ovulating than that you are pregnant.|`|p11HaDIWaa	damn lucky new guy, he got to hit it so soon...unfortunately ur going to have to just wait n see because its waaay to early to tell. u should have went and got the day after pill if u don't wanna have a baby or be with ur ex!!!
eRunXaAPaa	hi, ok interesting but yes it is possible depending on timing right...<br>  sperm can live up to 5 minutes outside the body so if he went in straight away with a good amount of *** on his hand as there are millions of sperm cells in just 1 ejaculation and deep enough for sperm to swim up the cervix and if she was in her ovulating period or most likely to fall pregnant time which is 10 to 15 days after her last period while doing this act then yes she could be pregnant scary hey? as sperm can live up to 3 days in the body and ovuation is around day 14 lasting about 24 hours? or she coudnt be as there is only 25% chance of concieving, so what you can do is as ask her a few questions of what i said timing of the sperm going in how deep and so on and about her cycle work it out and just tell her to wait until her period comes if its late dont worry yet she could just be stressed causing a delay but do take a home test they usually accurate if not convinced by result have a blood test done ok good luck!|`|cfe693074760514255e63a1a5d0dba6eaa	First of all, slow down. Literally, I know at 16 you want to experience it all and that includes sex. But slow down, and always use a condom, even if you're on the pill. Second, chances are that just because some sperm was on the hand while he finger banged your friend or you, it won't get you pregnant. Now what I recommend you do is get used to your body and get past this barrier that the Bush administration and Retardicans have shoved down your throat and learn about reproduction. During penetration, the penis actually goes in pretty deep to get past the "barriers" of the vagina in order to get into the ovaries where the eggs are to fertilize them. Merely getting sperm past the labia is not going to do it unless its a significant amount. However a  little on the hand is not going to be enough. So relax, use a condom, and most importantly, educate yourself.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	1 yes she could but it's EXTREMELY unlikely<br>  2 not much until she finds out for sure<br>  3 wait and then test when she is due her period....i'm pretty sure it will be negative<br>  <br>  edit - it also has to be the exact  right time of the month too|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Their is a very very slim chance she could be pregnant, something like 1 in 30,000,000  so chances are she's not pregnant but tell her to take more care in the future as this was obviously a very stupid thing to do!!|`|pZCWKlkVaa	It is possible to get pregnant without penetration, however, using this method would be quite small. Did he have a lot of sperm on his hand? Did he pleasure her immediately? Did he go inside with his fingers? All these things slightly increase the chance. <br>  Hopefully she isn't as the chance is very very small but if she is very worried she should go to family planning clinic or her doctors, they are very helpful and in most countries give good advice and keep it confidential from parents if she is worried about what they would say. They can also do a blood test which can be done earlier than a normal pregnancy test and is more accurate. Go with her to the clinic if she wants you to, it will help to know someone supportive is with her.<br>  <br>  xx|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's not the most likely thing but it is possible. All you can do is be supportive while she waits to test. She can't do anything but wait and take a test when it's been 14 days since the incident. Most of the time if you test before that will not be accurate.|`|AA12050428	Highly unlikely.
x9cIEeDeaa	i am going through the EXACT same thing...and if i was pregnant i would also be 4 weeks and 6 days but idk cause ive taken two pregnancy tests so far and both were negative even with early morning pee. I am 3 days late for my period also but even if I am i would still probably have to wait another month before I can see my doc. But other symptoms I have are I feel kinda sick in the morning and after I eat I feel as if im gonna throw up everything I just ate. I really wanna be pregnant so hopefully this is my shot!...But anyways good luck to you!|`|eRunXaAPaa	Hi there first of all if you had unprotected sex between the 10th and 15th day after your last period which is your fertile and most likely time to fall pregnant there is a chance you might be pregnant because ovulation( release of your egg waiting to be fertilized) last for 24 hours around the 14th day after your period and sperm can live upto 3 days inside you so if you had sex on the 12th 13th 14th day after your last period you might be pregnant however there is only a 25% chance of falling pregnant so if you diligent with keeping track of your cycle do the maths, take a home test they usually accurate if not convinced by the result have a blood test done good luck :-)|`|dbyJhlruaa	The symptoms you are experiencing may be a sign of pregnancy but consider also that it might be because of stress. Stress is a big factor of having that symptoms. Try to see an obstetrician to clear your worries or you can also do pregnancy test by yourself.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	if u would be 4 weeks 3day that means your period is only 3 days late<br>  u calculate from the first day of your last period <br>  u cant put on 'baby weight' in only 3days maybe u drank more at the time u weighed yourself?<br>  as u ARE late though get a pregnancy test :)|`|m0DgqEcjaa	i guess the only way to be sure is take a test, which you are doing next friday. All of the symptoms mentioned could be due to pregnancy but could be symptoms of something else!|`|bsruaHQCaa	Being male i wouldn't know too much about this subject. But it's definatley worth taking a test. You can never be too sure in the early stages of pregnancy. I guess the sickness is a bit of a strong sign. <br>  <br>  You have nothing to loose, so go for a test. Give yourself peace of mind.<br>  <br>  Good luck!.|`|6h8oPROtaa	the test should give you the right answer. When you felt sick did you smell any food?|`|jUneJXEIaa	If your period is already late then I would take the test now. Good luck x|`|F8rO5XXUaa	instead of asking ppl on yahoo get a test dude.
go2SGvFxaa	i am 16.  i found out at 9 weeks 4 days and was really worried but very happy. i wouldnt get an abortion even though my partner (now broken up) wanted me to get rid of it.<br>  i was worried about telling my parents but i knew i had to and when i did they were suprisingly good about it. they are really supportive. its not as bad as you might think telling your parents, yeah we are young but if we are young enough to be able to get pregnant then we are old enough to be a mum.<br>  now even though i didnt know until pretty much 10 weeks ,my signs were<br>  mood swings<br>  sore breasts and nipples<br>  completely turned off eating anything<br>  feeling really sick<br>  i still got my period for 2 months<br>  in a way i just felt it.<br>  now i am 32 weeks on tuesday and happier than ever that my little one will be here soon|`|lU5XZaJpaa	do the check, and if the result was positive: firstly introduce your mate to ur parents; and after a while go ahead and shock them with the surprise. and if it is negative then use condom next time.|`|PZYOTy2Haa	I'm 16, I'm not pregant but I had a scare a month or so back. It properly shook me up, and it will definitely make sure I'm more sensible in the future.|`|yxtMLgN8aa	15? that sucks. hope you're not!|`|hS7a6t4faa	Well im 16 and 7 months old. Im also 13 weeks and 3 days pregnant. I didn't actually tell my parents. My mom got ideas and made me take a test. It was positive so she kicked me out. So I live with my dad now. Its actually working out really well. Just tell the, if you're pregnant. Its going to be hard, but its better to just get it over with and get on with your life. If you need anything, my email is ashrawr@tmail.com|`|6h8oPROtaa	Just go and tell your parents and they will help you through this situation|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	Instead of worrying about all that, why dont you just take a test first and know for sure. Buy one at the dollar store or go to planned parenthood and get one done for free.<br>  Then if it is positive, you can worry about all that.|`|O9rBrOhkaa	I would suggest you use a condom next time! 15 is much too young, you will need to support your baby financially and i dont know how tht is possible at 15. They are a full time job and a lot of work. you need to be sure you have the financial support to take care of your baby if they get sick, need something urgently and provide food and a roof over their head. Dont forget they will need to start school when you are 20 and you will have to pay for it.. Get a test and if it is positive start saving and start reading parenting books.
rNvXWMOMaa	yes, abortion is wrong..|`|obN6p3Cgaa	Yes.........|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	IF they want to keep the baby, raise the baby, pay for all the pregnancy related things and sign legal docs saying all this then sure... if not then no<br>  <br>  Edit: Ironmaid.. Jacob's daddy is such a good daddy, thanks for welcoming my son to the world, can't believe he's 9 months already|`|vY0ScgeXaa	yes, afterall wer all human.<br>  <br>  so why not, women got their sufferage in 1919, so yea its democrasy or something all men are equal, male or female, female are allowed man should be allowed to. so yea thats ur answer.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i am not saying abortion is right or wrong. with that said.....<br>  no i don't think men should have the choice of whether or not a woman should have an abortion. i don't think they should get a say because even though it may be their child it's the WOMAN who has to go through 9 months of pregnancy and all the ups and downs that goes with it and even if someone gave the man the option to take care of the child once it's born that DOES NOT mean that he will actually step up and take responsibility. and if the man doesn't step up and take care of his kid where is the kid left then? with a mother who never wanted him/her or in foster care waiting to be adopted?<br>  it's not that man who has to go through it all and when it comes right down to it once the baby is born it's usually the woman who ends up being the sole provider. so i don't think men should have a say.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Only if they want to keep the baby. The reason? It's half theirs, as well and they should have a say in it. If they don't want it, they shouldn't be able to force a woman to abort, they should sign over their rights at birth. <br>  <br>  Just imagine if the roles were reversed and men could legally force an abortion on a woman. How hurt would you be if you really wanted to keep it but were told it's not your concern? I imagine the guy who has no say would feel just as terrible if he wanted it.<br>  <br>  I also think married couples should have to agree on it. If you said vows for better or worse and to make decisions as one, I think an unplanned pregnancy is a time to employ that.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Personally, i think in the situation of rape - than the male should not have a say. <br>  If you become pregnant unexpectadly and the Father leaves because of the pregnancy, than you consider to abort, the Father shouldnt have a say because he walked out on its life anyway.<br>  <br>  But i think if the Father was to be an active part of the childs life than by all means he has as much say as the Mother.|`|mFInMKSaaa	if you even contemplate an abortion, then you have mental issues and shouldn't be a mother.  go with adoption instead.  if you abort a child, i would think it would stick with you forever.<br>  Good thing for Jacob his father was willing to raise him and pay the money for the bills and sign documents and all that stuff.  Welcome to the world Jacob.|`|Ut9Y1xUoaa	"an opinion", yes. But it's up to the individual woman, as it should be; to decide for herself whether or not to do so. Everyone is entitled to "an opinion" on any matter.|`|WXcbE2H1aa	o course man have a say in it. ultimately, no matter how strong their opinions, if the woman wants an abortion, she will have it. but it is the mans baby as well, and i think that is all too often forgotten.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	Since it is not their body NO <br>  but of crouse they can beg us to have the baby|`|5ZvALiclaa	i think the father should get a say. <br>  If the woman doesn't want the baby but the man does, shouldn't she consider keeping the pregnancy and letting the father raise the baby even if it means being pregnant and giving birth? Its a lot for a woman to go thru I know, (i've given birth 3 times so I know the toll it takes) but should a man just step aside while his baby is 'killed' if he is completely able to take care of it even if she isn't?<br>  <br>  its a complicated subject but i think one worth considering for all woman out there who have men ready, willing and able to take care of that baby.|`|6e8eb208cb0422b7103ca1b8cb9ab2ecaa	I don't think it's up to you or anyone on this site to decide if someone is "allowed an opinion".  Everyone has an opinion, like it or not. <br>  In the case of discussions on abortions, i think both parties should have reasonable discussions on the subject without ruling someone out of the equation just because one party feels that the life they created is more theirs than the other person's.  sure, in the end the woman is physically and legally able to have the abortion without the man's consent, but to do that is just plain evil.<br>  <br>  As far as the rape part is concerned, I'd just try to focus on not getting raped first.  It's not healthy to rationalize things based on worse case scenarios.|`|lsKAp1qEaa	The Pope used to have the last say. Women today no longer see themselves as mere procreation machines naturally want the last say. However, pregnancy would bring much upheaval to their lives, having supportive family members or friends would greatly help. Most intelligent men today know their places. If it does not affect the mother's health (including mental health) adversely, unexpected baby could still bring much happiness to the mother and family. The law should ensure that a rapist have no legal right to the baby, a result of his crime. <br>  What do you think of the opinion of this man, me?|`|PmzTsiGiaa	Men have a right to an opinion. But they shouldnt preach it, and parade around with prolife signs.|`|CesgcMRYaa	Absolutely..it takes 2 people to get pregnant..obviously there are circumstances in which a woman was forced etc.. but when 2 people are in a relationship, whether that be a 1 night stand or a committed one they both chose to take part in something that created life.<br>  <br>  As for woman playing a major part, yes they carry the child but not all of them play a major part.  I am a single father of 2 boys..I cannot imagine my life without them..If my ex had ever told me she wanted an abortion I would have forced her in court to carry my child and hand custody to me if she didn't want any part of it.  <br>  <br>  People use abortion as an excuse to get rid of what they consider a "mistake" but it is not that child's fault but because we can't actually see the child with our own eyes as a society we think its "ok" to exterminate that life.  <br>  <br>  What if you were 10 years old and your parents all of a sudden said Ehhh this was a huge mistake keeping you, Click-Bang, should we look the other way and say well it was their choice..a life is a life at all stages.  <br>  <br>  As for a woman who was raped...that is something she would have to dig deep inside herself and only she could know if she was doing the right thing, even if others disagree.
2jiNLOKHaa	you should be taking a prenatal vitamin throughout your pregnancy. your body needs the extra vitamins for the development of your baby and to keep your own levels where they are supposed to be. if you don't have enough of the mineral in your blood stream your body will take it from where it can find it and give it to the baby. calcium is a good example of that. i knew a lady that didn't take prenatals and she wasn't getting enough calcium through her diet. she ended up loosing half her teeth. you should be taking a prenatal vitamin throughout your pregnancy for you health and the baby's. you should continue through your breastfeeding as well.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	you should take your prenatal vits from the time you find out your preg until your finished breast feeding. the folic acid is important in baby brain development and they baby is sucking  the vits out of your body. you need to replace them for yours and the babies sake:) either have your Dr prescribe you some or buy some over the counter, but be sure to take the additional folic acid:) good luck!|`|68bc66c1e7e70cc14bc1acfd1ca1bfa9aa	from 36 weeks i started taking raspberry leaf tea supplements.best thing i did!it prepares your cervix for labor and makes the second stage of labor quicker.i had a 4 hour labor that almost seemed too easy(i had a previous bad experience).heaps of my friends have taken it and also benefited from it.google it.<br>  congrats by the way!|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	They say you're supposed to take them.  I took them for awhile with my pregnancy, but then I stopped.  I was very healthy (aside from being overweight) and everything turned out fine.  However, to be on the safe side, you should probably take them.  Ask your doctor and see what she says.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Yeah i think you should be, it gives you extra vitamins that your body might be lacking. I personally take Pregnacare and think they're good.|`|wNtW1hXLaa	get on a pregnancy and breastfeeding multivitamin and keep taking it throughout the whole pregnancy and while and if you are breastfeeding. make sure it is one that has iodine, folate, omega 3. It doesn't have to be the most expensive one but just make sure it has all the essential things for you and the baby. the pharmicist will be able to help you decide which one is the best and make sure you read the bottle to find out how many tablets you should be taking a day. these vitamins make a big diiference to the breastfeeding. they really help with my milk supply.|`|pZCWKlkVaa	Its up to you. There is no research that shows taking vitamins after the first trimester helps unless there is a specific deficiency such as low iron levels. Personally I prefer to get my vitamins the natural way... from food! I hate taking tablets and vitamins are huge and hard for me to swallow! If your diet is good, ie a good range of fruit and vege then I am sure you will be fine. However, check it with your midwife or doctor they can give you the latest advice. If you are happy taking them then continue, they certainly don't do any harm and just because there is not research yet doesn't mean there won't be in the future to support continued use. <br>  What ever you decide try to to worry too much about it, ultimately there are women giving birth all over the world and only in the western world are we popping pills and treating the birth like a medical problem. <br>  <br>  xx|`|Q8tf4B5taa	i am taking sanatagen pro- natal, multivitamins and took them throughout my other pregnancys too.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	YES!

kaqPSgTVaa	Your uterus is actually almost up to your belly button. You are picking up the heartbeat that low due to the babies position. Your uterus has been above your pubic bone since week 14.|`|2jiNLOKHaa	the top of your uterus moves above your pubic bone at about 12 weeks. the reason you are finding the heart beat so low is most likely because your baby is in a face down position. that's a good thing. i wouldn't expect to hear the heartbeat up so high as you are thinking. where you are finding it is just right.
U1gGAStKaa	hey ya, well it is definately possible to ovulate later than normal. I have been like clockwork for years (unless I have started  new diet) 30 day cycles and December just gone I began a strictish diet and exercise. Had Fertile CM on and off for almost 2 weeks then found out 6th Jan I was pregnant. When I had a 6 week ultrasound the baby was 5wks 6 days meaning I ovulated 10 days later than day 14/15 as normal so it is very possible. The only reason I found out was I was having these stretchy weird cramps and I thought something was wrong, turns out that was just the beginning of it all and now I have been crook as ever since LOL :)  I really really hope you are. WE had been trying since sept last year and I did the whole a million preg tests LOL having my mind consumed by it all then early December I told my husband we are having a break from it all as I would like to lose abit of weight in preparation and surprise I got pregnant LOL!  fingers crossed for you.  Your symptoms sound pretty promising!! take care.  From kim :)|`|Ipj0dbrQaa	im pretty sure you can fall at any time but you are most fertile mid cycle, you sound like you've got the symptoms. it cant hurt to take a test.<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Its' too early to test positive if you two got lucky. It is very possible to ovulate late in your cycle due to your irregular periods. It's too early for pregnancy symptoms though too so just wait a few weeks and see what happens. Most women get positive results 14 days past ovulation and start to see symptoms a week to a week and a half past ovulation. Although if you ovulated on day 31 and didnt have sex until day 32 you may have been too late. The egg is only viable for 24 hours.
JkBbdg72aa	My hcg levels were very high in the beginning of my pregnancy. My levels showed that I was almost a month and a half before my ultrasound due date. My doctor too never gave me a reason for this, So I had two due dates. My hcg levels showed that I was supposed to be 18 weeks, where as my ultrasound showed that I was almost 11 weeks  My doctor went by my ultrasound due date which was a month and a half longer than my hcg levels indicated. I had my daughter very close to my ultrasound due date. She weighed 6.8 oz. and was a very healthy baby. It's scary not to know whats going on and why or how this has happenned. Just try not worry about it too much, which I know is hard to do. Good luck|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Whatever you are doing to raise your hcg levels seems to be working.  You have to keep doing this consistently so that they don't drop into the lower levels again.
s9xucwbSaa	well if your drink was spiked telling them will be easy as they will be like oh i am so sorry and they will be really worried as you have been reaped. make sure that you phone the police as the person you had sex with probably spiked your drink so that he could do it with you. and just be straight with your parents you cant help it if your drink was spiked. but when you tell them that you were at a party they might kick off saying you shouldn't have been there but i dono your parents so i dono if they will. but if they didnt know that you were at this party they will be angry that your brother let you go with him. <br>  trust me they can be angry at you for beingpregnante as it was rape but they can go mad at you for being at the party, just tell them coz thisisn'tt going to go away you need to do something about it before it is too late.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	you deffo need to tell your mum or dad<br>  <br>  do u know who the father is, or who spiked your drink? becuase what they did was illegal, the drink spiking and having sex with you, becaquse they were takin advantage of the fact you were drunk and drugged!<br>  <br>  if you cant tell them face to face, maybe write them a letter and put it some where so they will read it, and wait for them to *** to you, they wont go nuts because it was not your falult, just explain the whole story like you did on this (question)<br>  <br>  good luck, and i hope you will b ok <br>  <br>  x|`|8jBGhsWPaa	I'm so sorry to hear that. But remember babe none of this is your fault, you was drugged and raped so dont be affraid to speak to your parents about it because It was out of your power and there was nothing you could of done. Dont keep it bottled up inside because Its going to become to late to do anything about it and It wont always be easy to hide. I'm sure your parents will understand completely and certainly wont judge you, They may be shocked at what you have to tell them but at the end of the day they will want to help and protect you. Once you have got your pregnancy out in the open you need to report this to the police. If you know who spiked your drink you need to give their name to the police dont allow him to get away with what he did to you x|`|bppI7Pxzaa	Hello,<br>  When its just you and your parents in your home just say " i have something to tell you about the party " and then your parents will probably say "what" and then you could say " i had my drink spiked and as a result of this im pregnant" make sure you say this in a clam voice and then your parents will probably want time to think.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped =)<br>  x|`|AA12069058	That is the most bull **** thing ive ever heard,but at least you already have a lie made up so you dont look like a whore.

Just let them know what happened|`|O3EtP4vOaa	You need to go to your parents and tell them right away.  Tell them the whole story and have them get you to a doctor for a check up as soon as possible.  If you decide not to go through with the pregnancy then you only have a short window  and if you are going to have the baby you need proper medical care.  Do you know how far along you are?  What country do you live in?  If you are in the US there are lots of places to go where you can get medical help right away and they will help you tell your parents.|`|cHiaawxYaa	I'm sorry to to hear this, you need to tell your parents and work out whether or not to keep the baby or have a termination.

I know this is scary but it won't make it any better if you panic. make an appointment with your doctor and talk to your mum. She can give you better advice than any of us on here can; And you may be scared about her reaction, but you didn't do anything wrong. THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. <br>  Just sit her down, and tell her. The longer you wait, the harder it will get. Just get it over and done with. (:<br>  You have options; keep the baby (your mum could look after it, or you could), adoption, abortion - only availabe under 24 weeks, and if your only 15, then i think you need parental consent. This is your decision to make. And yours alone. (: You need to think of whats best for you AND your baby. It's hard, but it needs to be done. <br>  Your doctor can get you in touch with adoption agencies and get you information on abortion. You also need to talk to the police. What happened to you is illegal. Talk to a counselor at school.. they can give you more information on what you can do next...<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

k2zkyE4Raa	yes, its natural for everyone. be it boy or girl. you can find many physical & mental changes. you may feel an attraction towards the other gender. you will love to stay with your friends rather than your family.<br>  you cannot stop it even if you think that its unwanted.<br>  <br>  but don't worry everyone experiences the same.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Of course it does!  Their bodies are changing and some have lots of problems dealing with it.  Unless a teen has a great 'parental' connection, the ability to sit down with either parent and discuss everything, then they just don't know how to deal with what's going on inside of their bodies.  These kids are changing from a child into an adult - exactly who understand that?<br>  I have two grand daughters (12 year old twins) and their parents sit down with them and discuss everything with them.  When they visit me, I discuss things with them or answer any questions they have.  They, at times, don't understand some of the changes (why boys look at their chest instead of their face...) but when I discuss the transition (child to adult) they are a bit more receptive of what's going on.|`|5me8LbX2aa	yes,of course .<br>  this is because of hormonal changes .this changes our physical,mental,and sexual behavior,and we will get attracted to people of other gender.and would like to watch sexy and hot scenes.|`|tSKBsbIyaa	100%<br>  That is because of hormonal and psychological changes.<br>  Hormonal changes affect your physical appearance and sexual desires.

a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	i am the primary carer for my kids but they go visit their dad.  my partner has his kids visit.<br>  <br>  i found he was too lenient on his kids because he only saw them such a short time he didnt want to spend the whole weekend yelling.  it took a few years for him to realise he really wasnt helping his kids by going easy on them, as they mucked up more and mucked up when they go home.<br>  <br>  my ex also lets the kids get away with a lot, he also doesnt let them outside much, and arrives at the swap over point early and makes the kids sit in the car so by the time i get them their climbing the walls, makes for a horriable trip home.<br>  <br>  your partner needs to impletment a lot of the same rules as his ex (espically cause the child is 8) so he has a balance with things.  being allowed to run wild at your place will make things harder on him at home.  you need to get your partner to see that.|`|uP08b6K4aa	My first husband had two children from another relationship and we made it clear from day one that they would not be treated any differently in our house as they were in their own, in that they would never get away with things because he only saw them once per month.<br>  <br>  It was hard on my ex husband as the last thing he wanted were arguments when he only saw them for two days (his ex wife moved to the other end of the country) and wanted that time to be as special as possible but over the years, the ex wife came back to live nearby and he obviously got to see more of them.  In that respect, it worked out well because they would spend more time with us (and I think they live with him most of the time now!) and knew the rules and that this wasn't a holiday camp and they had to adhere to the way we got things done whilst here.  Children need routine in both homes because if one parent spoils them in one home, it can lead to no end of problems in the future.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped x|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	I'm not a parent, but rather a child who has been passed from parent to parent my entire life. You do get away with more, but for me that has only made me more mature. I think certainly stepmoms/dads are forced to let stepkids get away with things, because they are too scared what the real parent will think if they object to the child's behaviour. I think parents are more lenient to make up for it. What else can they do?|`|f49aab59bea9737e201eb6b2439035f2aa	i can understand where your other halfs coming from, my daughter spends half the week with me and half with her father (highly unfair way of life i know, but it was a stupid court ruling beleive it or not!!), at first i was letting her get away with murder and beleive me i'm now paying for it. she's only two and AARRGGHH!!! paddies over the smallest of things will go on for hours and hours at a time. <br>  <br>  you're a large part in this little boys life, and he's a huge bit of yours too, you owe it to him to sit his father down and tell him he's being too soft on him. tell him you know he just wants his boy to love the time he spends with dad, but that at his age rules and boundries need to be established so he doesn't go on to become one of these brats you hear about with ASBO's etc (just don't word it like that!). <br>  <br>  if you word it all perfectly he should understand, and be greatful thhat you're intrested in his sons welbeing. i hope for everyones sake (i dare say his mother notices a change in behaviour when he comes back from his dad's) you sort this out. good luck
p11HaDIWaa	absolutely with my daughter i didn't feel any movement until about 20 weeks but with this pregnancy (a boy) i felt him at about 11-12 weeks and i thought, no way this is way too early, but ever since then my little man has been super active. some people say that u can always feel boys move sooner then girls...good luck to u:)|`|1IDSGM71aa	I think it's very likely that that is what you're feeling. I was feeling my daughter somewhere between 12 and 15 weeks. Not exactly sure when, because I didn't know I was still pregnant at the time, so I assumed it was something else.
pZCWKlkVaa	It depends how large the clots are and how bad the pains. The clots are causing the pain and usually your uterus dissolves them using a substance similar to that found in some medication for period pain relief. If your body is not producing much of it then the blood clots and you have to cramp to remove them. Having said that it is abnormal to pass large clots and have very bad pains, this could be a sign of endometriosis/ retained placenta (although rarer now as the placenta is checked) or possibly infection. Get your midwife or doctor to have a look. If you pass a very large clot save it for them to examine.<br>  <br>  xx|`|2F5HNPqPaa	After pains are normal, but I'm not sure if you should still be having them after 5 days... but I've only had one baby.  <br>  <br>  I know when I had him the midwife always asked to check if I'd been passing large clots... you should probably speak to your health professional.  It may well be within normal, but it's always better to be safe than sorry.  Especially if you're in lot of pain!|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	see a doctor asap|`|5ZvALiclaa	it depends on how big these clots are. Passing clots can be a sign of some placenta being left in the uterus which is not such a good thing. Small pieces, like fingernail size now and then is okay, but if they are considerably larger than that, you need to phone the maternity ward of the hospital and run it by them.<br>  <br>  After pains do tend to be pretty bad with subsequent children especially if you are breastfeeding. They recommend taking a paracetamol 30 minutes before a feed to lessen the pain. If that does not take the pain to a bearable limit then phone the maternity ward and again speak to the midwives. If you do indeed have very large clots caused by retained placenta this could be the reason for the pain and it needs to  be sorted fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|wNtW1hXLaa	it sounds normal given what you have been through. 5 days isn't long. I got large clots for about 3 days after. i heard the after pains get worse with your second baby. i think you should run it past a doctor just to be sure.|`|CesbKR1qaa	Many people told me the afterpains could be really bad for a second birth. I'm not sure what the reason is but it can happen. Because you have clots I'd go see your GP just to make sure everything is ok. Good luck!|`|1enIWBGnaa	You could have an infection.  This happened with me after my first one was born.  You should call your doctor A.S.A.P.  If you are seeing large clots - perhaps they didn't get all of the 'after birth' out.....
gRWzLHVEaa	Being pregnant is like the best and worst roller coaster you have ever been on. The first trimester you feel sick, vomit, emotions are all over the place, you feel fat... Second trimester u get a little break , baby starts to move and you feel wonderful... Third trimester you are big as a whale, hemmroids, weepy, pee your pants when u sneeze, back aches, feet swell, constipated, heartburn, all your insides are squished... Want me to go on? <br>  Then labor, the worst most intense pains you have ever experienced. Some women are lucky and it goes fast but some women it's a couple days of this! Natural childbirth you push like you are taking the biggest dump of your life ( while trying not to be embarassed that you are pushing out not just a baby but any pee and poop in your body... And this is not always a fast process, for some women the pushing alone is a few hours!! <br>  I could go into more detail but because you are a man you can never truly understand the profound effect becoming a mother has on a woman.|`|WVPRUzLuaa	it is an amazing feeling when you start feeling the kicks it feels at first like flutters or like fish swimimg around in your belly then when it getts stronger it feels like some one is pushing all your organs around.<br>  as for the begining the vomiting feels like a bad hang over but mornings are the worst cause you through up all ur stomic acids,constent heart burn ,head aces and not to menchen the worry if the baby is ok when it hasnt kicked for a while.<br>  towards the end of the pregnancy your bones move and strech that is so pain fall.<br>   you just cant roll over in bed any more .<br>   you get cramps and when its near the due date .<br>   when the heads ingaged it feels like you pelvic bone has been bashed with a hammer, but it realy feels worth it to have something growing in side of you <br>  as for the labbour it is so so so pain fall it feels like you keep getting stabbed in the belly whilst it is cramping  and when the baby is ready to come out it feels like you are constepated so badly thats the pushing part and amagen pushing out a poo so hard it splits you open. <br>  As much as it sounds bad and all women do forget the labour pains in time and that why they want another one.<br>   when you have the baby in your arms it is the most amazing feeling that i think only a women can feel it was all worth it, it is a instent love that grew in side of you and it is a diffrent love than what people feel for there partners you dont have to work on the love like a relationship it is instently there and you know it will never ever fade it is so darn amazing.<br>  i hope that answers some of your questions|`|go2SGvFxaa	well im almost 8 months and its a great feeling but it does get very uncomfortable towards the end of pregnancy. i wouldnt know what giving birth feels like but that is something i am looking forward too. just not looking forward to the pain|`|nVxPAWaYaa	Basically......Try and imagine squeezing a grape out through the end of your penis!|`|fR9ENBmEaa	labour pains are a type of cramp..gets harder and harder till you have the baby.<br>  pregnant just made me feel sick|`|1IDSGM71aa	For me, being pregnant was a miserable time, partly because in my state midwife assisted home births are illegal, so I was denied the birth that I wanted. Morning sickness was just like constantly having your stomach upset. Kicks were amazing and indescribable. The flutters that came before harder kicks was kind of like gas lol. Giving birth wasn't that painful for me. Imagine having a muscle cramp in your lower abdominal area that comes and goes, but gets stronger over the course of several hours (in my case, I was in labor for almost 70). Birth itself was described to me by a friend as "taking a huge $hit" lol, and I guess that's the easiest way to explain it to a guy, or anyone else, since the bowels was the area I felt it in the most. It was a very interesting sensation, but impossible to describe.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I don't think being pregnant is all that nice, i've had sickness, tiredness, eating every hour, constipation, haemerrhoids, peeing alot, backache, sleepless nights, cramps and i can't stand up for more than 10mins without feeling dizzy and faint. Apart from that, i think it's amazing feeling a baby kick and move inside me.<br>  <br>  I've not yet experienced labour or delivery, but i've always been told that contractions feel like extreme cramping, that cramping gets worse the further you dialate and it can become very unbearable that you can't stand up or speak through them. It depends on your body though, some people take labour worse than others. <br>  <br>  Delivery is supposed to be easier, the baby coming out is just supposed to feel like extreme pressure and when the head crowns it feels like a burning, nipping sensation. Of course you still get contractions through this so it's still going to be pretty painful if your contractions are bad.<br>  <br>  After giving birth, your uterus still contracts until the placenta has been delivered and will continue to contract until your uterus has went back to it's original size, this can take a day or 2. Your boobs become engorged with milk and tender, they also leak. This will happen for about 1-2weeks if you're not breastfeeding until the milk drys up. You will continue to have vaginal bleeding for a while too, that can take upto a week or more to stop. <br>  <br>  So to be honest, it's not all that fun and you should count yourself lucky you don't have to go through that.|`|p11HaDIWaa	ok well being pregnant is nice because everyone is so sweet to u and its nice knowing that there is an actual human being inside of u, and feeling him move and kick and punch u in the ribs is a crazy feeling. but once u get to about 8 months every single bone and muscle in ur body aches, bones and muscles i never knew existed lol ok so labor is crazy because u know that ur only hours away from meeting the little person inside u that has been growing for soooo long, so ur excited,scared,nervous, and it extreme pain all at the same time. when ur pushing u can actually feel the baby move down ur loins (i know it sounds weird but that's how i remember it) and once the head is actually out the rest of the body just sploshes out like jello and u feel a huge relief and all the pain is completely gone. all in all its an awesome feeling and i think its wonderful that u would like to experience it and i think when u have a baby of ur own ur baby's mother will be lucky because it sounds like u will be so involved and u will be an awesome dad!!!:)|`|1nYasMYqaa	I'm a guy, yet I know this:<br>  <br>  physically: painful, average pain to extreme pain<br>  mentally: varies; sometimes great, sometimes horrible, most likely mixed|`|AA10779494	Congratulations!

dCVVP3hmaa	Yep, my first positive (which was positive outside the timeframe) was so feint, you could hardly see it!  I took another one the next day (I found that my afternoon urine had more hSG in it than morning, so my afternoon tests were always darker....) and it was darker!  I am now 34 weeks pregnant!  Test again tomorrow, and I send you plenty of baby dust!  Edit:  What is with these women who says "evaporation line".  The HPT will only pick up on hCG if it is present in your urine - this happened to me, and others, so why does it have to be an evaporation line?  Grrrrrrr......|`|NOz2FRlraa	Yes, you checked too late. Take another test tomorrow morning and see what that says because you can't rely on a pregnancy tests more than 10 minutes after you took it.|`|VMASMHX6aa	That sounds like an evaporation line. You can't read a test after 10 minutes and if the line was that faint it can't be trusted anyway.|`|VPVg792eaa	any line faint or not means you are pregnant you can do more tests at anytime <br>  good luck hun xx|`|igbdywwVaa	I swear I'm the queen of the light lines. Might be too early. Try again in 2-3 days (or now if you choose) and it should be much darker if you're pregnant. My experience has been that if there's a line, you're pregnant! I had a late "show" on one I did...I was out buying another because I messed up and came home to a positive test. And the OTHER brand (important when testing early) was also positive. <br>  <br>  In Sum: My advice is to try 2 different brands when you get light lines. If they are there on both, no matter how faint, you're pregnant! Since you'll probably have at least one left over, try again in 2-3 days and it should confirm with a darker line. <br>  <br>  Early congrats and good luck! =)|`|AlxMp9l3aa	Any + sign is good weather its faint or not ive just found out i was pregnant 3 weeks ago and my 1st one was very faint but the 2nd one was very visible.  You can go to the doctors and get a blood test done free of charge this is 100% accurate and you should be able to get the results with 48hrs.  ive just recently had my blood done to check my hcg levels, as i have had bleeding but have now stopped.<br>  <br>  I always go have my bloods done as i have done pregnancy tests before and they showed i wasn't pregnant, but in fact i was 3 months pregnant with my son, and i did 3-4 tests.<br>  <br>  Are you showing signs of pregnancy?|`|8bUKN0vNaa	Any line, no matter how faint, is a positive.  However, if you checked outside the recommended time then it could just be an evaporation line.<br>  <br>  To be sure, wait 3-4 days then test again to allow the HCG levels to increase.<br>  <br>  You can always go and get a blood test from the doctor as well<br>  <br>  I hope you get the answer you're after :)|`|f42b59297654b7eb6918a980d6b6cf64aa	Do another test first thing tomorrow morning.  My positive lines (I did three tests!) were really faint.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  14 wks with number 2|`|wNtW1hXLaa	do another one asap and wait the correct time period.|`|OJFz0LBZaa	i wouldn't go by the test you took i would leave it another day or so and test again with 1st morning urine as you looked at the test to late and could be a evaporation line|`|mxixfE3Raa	You should discard any result which appears after 10 minutes. So this faint positive line will not be any sign. You should just take a test again as soon as you can with morning urine.
ZbnxGIsnaa	Gosh, that's a tough one dear.  Sounds almost identical to what happened to me.  Last week actually I took a test at 4am and watched it and watched it and saw a tiiiiiiiny line trying to form, but it was still white.  It didn't change colors. . . so, I thought.  Right!  I took it into the bedroom with me and laid it next to the bed and looked at it that next morning and there was a very very faint pink line you could see under a light.<br>  <br>  I was a little skeptical of it, but just knew I was pregnant.  I could sense it.  So, I tested again that day and there was a line after 10 min again.  I know you are not supposed to wait that long, but there was a line.  So, that following day I went to Wal-mart and bought a Clear Blue Easy digital test and took it that afternoon and it came back reading, "pregnant."  So, what I'm saying is.  You may be pregnant and your hcg is taking awhile to register on the tests.  Try a clearblue easy digital.  =)  My period was January 28th, by the way!  So, you should definitely be able to get a positive now.  Best of luck!|`|AA10063059	it is invalid after 10mins you must do it in the time limit re do again tomorrow,and how can  you not have much urine after a nights sleep?|`|pZCWKlkVaa	You may be pregnant but try again, this time drink a pint of water before you go to bed then when you wake up use a new pregnancy test. read the instructions carefully... after 10 minutes the result becomes more inaccurate. Looking at it after 2 hours doesn't help you as lines can appear. <br>  You can test again tomorrow as you are overdue your period. If it comes back negative you should ask your doctor to check you as missed periods should be investigated. <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  xx|`|eRunXaAPaa	you should take a another test, but with your first wee and make sure you read the instructions properly lol but the positve line do appear after some time afterwards which doesnt mean anything but a faint line within the time could well be a positive and a sign to take the next step have a blood test. as for being so late you could be pregnant or it could be some thing more serious my advice go see a doctor...|`|SOMsyfzuaa	I would take the test again in the morning. I had this last week, i ended up taking 7 (I had taken 5 by my gp recommended i take another2) 5 were positive and 2 negative have now confirmed that I am pregnant. My last period was also january. <br>  <br>  Good Luck x
ufcQlbGNaa	not sure about dogs, but i am aware that cat poop contains toxoplasmosis which is a nasty bug that can cause birth defeats, so it is advised to not change a litter tray, and maybe you should think about keeping them outside anyway, when you bring your new baby home you dont want them in the house do you? dogs are territorial, so you should teach them early to stay outside so they bring no threat to your child|`|JkBbdg72aa	I suggest instead of putting them in another room, you really work hard at getting them house trained. Its not healthy for either I would think. I know cats are bad...well literboxes are bad. But what are you going to do when the baby arrives and there is dog poop?? Not to mention that 4 dogs pooping all over the house, has got to make it smell pretty bad in there. I suggest you get them house trained or start kenneling them in the evenings. A dog will not poop in his bed, and during the day let them out side, within a fenced area of course. How old are your dogs?|`|SQw16c5Daa	Poo carry's so many diseases. One way to get food poioning is when people don't wash there hands after going to the toilet and then preparing food. This is the same with animal poo. The dogs should go outside and stay out there. You can't have those dogs around a baby. even the best dog can get jealous and bite a baby. make sure you ALL wash ur hands after touching the dogs. Make sure you get all the carpets/lounges cleaned before the baby comes. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kUZPjf2vaa	Don't you think you should house train them????? Dogs poo can make babies blind if they come in contact - let them outside thats disgusting!|`|mQg5SVQXaa	She shouldn't clean up the dog litter.  The sun room sounds like a good idea as long as it doesn't get too hot in there for the dogs and they have plenty of water.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	NO it isn't ok for a dog to poop in the house, not only while your wife is pregnant but in general smelling dog feces while pregnant can cause a miscarriage so i would be putting the dogs out side from now on besides it is very un- healthy for a human being and a small child to be smelling dog feces..|`|klDiZgKQaa	No that is not okay, whether your wife is pregnant or not!

Invite the kids over and let them play at your house, maybe they'll all become friends, you never know :).|`|6IJScRyeaa	i would call child protective services to say i  ' am afraid for the children's' lives '  and also tell that bullying is a learned behavior (which c.p.s. already knows). once c.p.s. gets involved then i would press charges against the children.<br>  <br>  you have to do one before the other. this way the parents already have one 'strike' against them and it will be easier to have the next 'strike' against them when you call about your son.|`|IZWqZC46aa	Its bullying, if its at school speak to the Headteacher/Headmistress about it and discuss talking bout his parents about it.<br>  <br>  It shouldnt be right, and to be make you feel better i hope you make the right decision.|`|AA11537580	where is this taking place?<br>  school? tell the teachers/principal<br>  neighbourhood? keep him away from the area, too much of an age difference and that kid is a bully to pick on a much younger child.|`|sCehoTIsaa	Report the parent and child to the police next time it happens.|`|tSwCd5kvaa	I'll just drag my child out of that mess and try to avoid them as much as possible.|`|WVNMnvXLaa	pay a 10/11 year old to beat him up|`|AA11455733	First make sure your child did not start the problem, it is possible he said or did something to start it. Once this is done then let the other parent know if it continues you will be reporting to the police the problem. Also keep a journal of the events where they took place and when as well as what happened then you will be armed with important information when it is needed, and you can show a pattern of trouble. If this is happening at school go to the principal and ask why it has been allowed to happen and continue all this time, are the children let unattended or what.|`|Zrh3vwEAaa	as your son is only 8 I would keep him away from the others, I know its hard but, you dont want your son copying their behaviour, sit him down and explain why. As for the other mother I would stay away, at the end of the day we are always protective of our kids and we all teach different values obviously you do a good job even if she doesnt.|`|DGCIrUBcaa	Bullying is not something any 6 yr. old child should have to endure.(Any child for that matter). It is being taken much to lightly. If someone acted this way toward an adult at work, most likely, the authorities would be called and assault charges laid. Why are things any different because children are involved. Children are way more vulnerable and as parents it is our responsibility to protect them. <br>  <br>  My first step would be to talk to the bully's parents (which you did). If the parents refused to do anything and the problem continued, I would go the the authorities and then I would report her to social services.<br>  The damage caused by bullies can cause scarring that can last a lifetime.<br>  Good luck with your little guy|`|yxtMLgN8aa	Tell the older kids you will call the cops on them. Maybe they will get scared and leave your child alone. Tell that B**** mom too you will call the cops on her son. He can get in trouble for it especially if your child gets hurt. What if that older kid pushed yours down and busted his head on the ground. You need to take action!|`|itMcT95Qaa	i would talk to the child [tell them to stop] and if they carry on then i would talk to the childs mother and hopefully the childs mother would disaplin them and tell them to stop and if that didnt work then i would talk to the school and the school would sort it out xx|`|oZIWhhoNaa	Just watch your child at all times and keep him/her away from the idiots that are attacking him/her. Especially keep an eye on him/her when they are outside. Leave the mother to eventually go to jail for something. (My guess is drugs. =) )|`|un0gZ7Ybaa	Request a conference with the principal. Don't punch her, it will make you a hypocrite and cause more problems. That won't solve anything. You can't stop violence with more violence.|`|q1EV0j1Saa	Try to keep your kid away from them as much as possible. Some parents just don't realize that their kids are big meanies and need to be taught a lesson.|`|0db31c6c3fde0b29640263ac4dd4a8efaa	I would have a quiet word in this kids ear and just let him know exactly what you think might happen but make sure no witnesess|`|glYm0NkUaa	if this is at school...<br>  <br>  see the teacher or principal.<br>  <br>  maybe see why the kids are fighting and see if you can resolve anything.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|uP08b6K4aa	If you've already approached the mother of these children, then I'd be inclined to take it further if your children are coming to physical harm on a regular basis.  It's up to the parent involved to contain their children's behaviour inside and especially outside their home for fear of such repercussions and if they're not doing so, it's up to the authorities to deal with it.<br>  <br>  Is there anyway you can perhaps encourage your child/ren to keep away from these children or play nearer to home so you know what's going on and can see it for yourself, because sometimes children are just being children and squabbling.<br>  <br>  Keep away from the mother, she sounds like a nightmare, and you'll get in to far more trouble than you clearly deserve if you assault her, something I'm sure neither you nor your children need to happen.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|q0Dg8a1haa	Beat the crap outta that bully lol<br>  <br>  Give the mom a serious telling off for ignoring what is right in front of her eyes.<br>  <br>  P.S.

Why risk it?|`|kFjNO9Yjaa	no alcohol is okay during preganancy! would you give your newborn baby a bottle of red wine instead of milk? no, but that is what you are giving your baby inside you.|`|yADdOLoqaa	i think u can do almost anything u want during pregnancy just check some medical sites because some think that certain things can cuase problems in the developing baby - wine should b ok though|`|olMVfnljaa	Since half of the things you eat and drink every day travels down a tube to feed the baby, so does alcohol. Alcohol seriously harms the baby and if you wouldn't feed your baby red wine when it's born, you really shouldn't drink it during pregnancy. The baby's little organs are only developing now, and as you know, alcohol can harm a full grown adults fully developed liver, so imagine a tiny baby with a weak liver being fed alcohol. This can permanently damage the baby's liver. <br>  <br>  This sounds really harsh but it's just the truth! And I know lots of people drink wine during pregnancy, but it's wrong :(<br>  Good luck with your baby :)|`|mxixfE3Raa	In the first 12 weeks there is a medium-high chance of misscarriage. You're supposed to be extremely careful in these first 12 weeks. I wouldn't drink any more. I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about, but it's best to be on the safe side. Atleast wait until you're in your 2nd trimester and drink a maximum of 2 glasses per week.|`|p11HaDIWaa	wow this is interesting. i know that everyone is different but damn u can't even wait 9 months to not drink? the second i found out i was pregnant with both kids i had to make changes and adjustments, no big deal. i mean its only temporary right? my husband wouldn't even let me near his mom because she smokes, why risk anything negative!!! good luck to u and i hope it all turns out fine for u!|`|kUZPjf2vaa	I am going to keep an eye on this post!!!

We liked to challenge the tastebuds a bit with food like lemon chicken and cous cous, vege casserole that had apricot in it etc etc. We often served finger foods as well... nursery school kids love to play with their food and making men or smily faces out of food is so much fun for them. We tried to source all our foods locally from free range farms... it wasn't always possible on the buget but where we could we did.<br>  Hope that helped.<br>  xx|`|xubIaiZaaa	i used to work in childcare last year<br>  menu was like this-<br>  morning tea - cheese and fruit platter with juice<br>  Lunch - cooked meal with meat/veg and either rice/pasta/mash with water.<br>  sweets after lunch- either icecream/yogurt/custard<br>  afternoon tea - cake (plain no icing or toppings) or muffins with milk<br>  and after nap time they got vegemite or cheese spread on wholemeal bread|`|0d1GuxOlaa	I have been in childcare for 6 yrs now and bout to leave to have a baby!! anyway at the center i work at we have a four week rotational menu regulations say we must have 2 vego dishes a fortnight the basic idea of a days food served is Morning tea appox 930am is fruit platter served with toast and water then lunch at 1130 is a hot meal served with a cup of milk after the chn have there main meal cheese and apple are then severed to aid in teeth cleaning then at 3pm they have afternoon tea this Can be from cake(egg-less butter-less milk-less due to allergy's) to crackers with vegemite or even anzac biscuits and then for the late stayers in the center at 5ish late snack is offered. hopeful this has helped
CxCigxZIaa	Just wait till he (the bio dad) calls. <br>  If your son has any questions AFTER that call then talk to him. <br>  Personally I wouldn't even mention it to your son. (he might not call after all)<br>  Anyway..once your son's father hears (saying if he does call) his son and know that he doesn't even KNOW him anymore there are 2 options. Either he can start seeing him (physically) or calling him more. OR he can let the man that is raising him continue to do so.<br>  This is harder for YOU than anyone else. I understand totally that you don't want your son to be hurt. Is there any pictures of his bio dad around? I mean...have YOU cut him out of his life due to him not calling/seeing him? <br>  I would NOT show him a pic of his bio dad until he calls. And the only reason I say this is because when and if he calls - if you have a pic of him while he talks to him he might recognize him. (possible)<br>  I wish you the very, very best.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	It's simple, don;t say anything until he calls. then just say it's your father from ( where ever he is). Don't make a big deal out of it. No drama.
md9rI5Y6aa	sounds like everything is okay.  i was worried with this during my pregnancy and i went to labor and delivery and everything was fine.  the doc told me that at home if you get worried about this you should have a nice sized meal then lay on your side for an hour and count how many times you feel the baby move, it you feel movement at least 8 to 10 times in an hour everything is okay,  babies are like everyone else, somedays they are active and others they just wanna relax.|`|UlLIs2aMaa	im pretty sure it is. mayb he is tired 4 once.babies need a break 2
5ZvALiclaa	no its normal. My daughter only had 6 teeth when she was 13 months, the 7th came up at 16 months and rest followed pretty soon after. By age 2 she had a mouthful. <br>  <br>  My best friends son only got his first tooth at 14months so you son is completely normal. Be thankful, the later the teeth come the better the teeth are and the easier it is when they do cut them. I hardly knew when my daughter was cutting a tooth where as my 7 month old has 2 teeth and when he cut them, especially the second one, it was a nightmare!<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|1enIWBGnaa	Teeth appear when they're ready to appear. <br>  My three children teethed at different times - I just never worried about it.  They were healthy and that was my main concern.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	he is fine, every child is different, my daughter had all her teeth before she was 1 year old, my grandson was nearer 2 before he had all his teeth, my granddaughter was 1 year old before her first tooth came threw, she only had a few by 18 months. The next teeth your son will get is his eye teeth before the molars start to arrive. My sister had all her second teeth before she started school,|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I wouldn't be worried about it at all. They'll poke through eventually. At 14 months my son got those first 4 molars all at once, and already had all his incisors... but my good friend's son is about 13 months with no teeth whatsoever. Teeth come in weird spurts sometimes.
CxCigxZIaa	They're both kids. Teens...but still kids.|`|Rk87mqkoaa	No difference between a 15yo and a 16yo, so I wouldn't care who I have to class. I would make a difference between a 15yo and a 5yo or between a 15yo and a 25yo.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	15 year olds and 16 year olds are both classed as children. But they are older children.|`|AA12155452	No because growing up from a child is a gradual process and althought the law defines that a sixteen year old can have sex and marry legally, they are still very much subject to their own personal development and may still very much retain a child's mentality or they may be very grown up in many ways.  My personal view of a 'child' is someone that is below the age of say 18 and remains dependent on parents.  But that is just an opinion. This is actually a good question as modern day thinking varies so much, especially among the 16-18 year olds!!|`|CC6dSdJmaa	They are not so much a child as a teen, a different breed between childhood and adulthood. Puberty is always a difficult period, but some teens will not be happy being classed as a child after about 13.<br>  It really does depend on their individual rate of mental and physical maturity, I have known 14yr olds that are more sensible and mature than 16yr olds!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I would say anyone under 18 is still a child|`|fAN8snFdaa	yes only because when you turn 16 you have different rights, like you can leagally leave home, school, get a drivers lisence..<br>  i think at 16 you can go to <juvenile>> jail? not 100% perhaps it's 18? anyways.. a 16 year old is still really a child|`|Kijk9dIRaa	yes, when you turn 16, you feel a lot older...<br>  <br>  16 is more older teens, or young adults, yeah 15 is a child<br>  <br>  i think personally.|`|xFkVlZBLaa	no i don't .<br>  because 16 yrs old may be more smarter than 15 yrs old but by calling him or her a child compared to 16 yrs old you are hurting his/her feeling<br>  & self respect.|`|10b1R3ibaa	Yeah, I don't know though because maturity changes gradually, not straight away.<br>  Maybe because it's legal for 16 year olds to have sex.|`|xC9SIZbGaa	Depends on the person - and we're all children if you only consider knowledge or materials to judge others.. If we stop growing, we die :)|`|il36RWQDaa	I would classify them as a teenager. And 16 up as a young adult.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	15/16 same...child|`|WyWHvUXJaa	yes I would|`|GipNI4y0aa	no
VMCBNNlzaa	I would choose Anthony Hilario because I think it sounds the best with the "r" sound in the middle name.<br>  <br>  Because of the "r" sound in the middle name I wouldn't use Ryan, Adrian, or Gabriel.<br>  <br>  Anthony is a classic name that isn't overused and would be a nice tribute to the baby's grandfather.|`|PmzTsiGiaa	Gabriel. :)|`|sVio6Ia9aa	how about Lysander?|`|5ZvALiclaa	First choice by far would be Ryan! Then Adrian, Anthony and lastly Garbriel - i really dislike Gabriel as I find it far to feminine for a man, just not my cup of tea at all. <br>  <br>  But Ryan and Adrian are really good|`|AA11273571	I vote for Adrian Hilario.  It sounds classic.  Hilario is a nice Hispanic name... I like it.|`|R1cey1Evaa	Adrian is too feminine. <br>  <br>  Gabriel is awesome! Gabriel Hilario- Just dosn't flow right. <br>  <br>  Anthony is a grat name! Anthony Hilario- Flows great!<br>  <br>  Ryan is cute too! Ryan Hilario dosn't flow that well either.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you should go with ANTHONY HILARIO. Due to the fact that it is also a family name and it will mean more to you than Ryan, Gabriel or Adrian.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ei9ibThuaa	I like Anthony out of those, it sort of rings with Hilario<br>  <br>  I know its not there, but I think Luke would sound kinda cute.|`|5qqHNpmcaa	theyr all quite a bit ordinary, dont u think?|`|kTchGkdSaa	Maybe the name Jasper, it's nice, different and has a good ring to it.
971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	They give you ointment to put on him (like A&D ointment, which is like neosporin).  He will be red and tender for a week or two and you just simply apply the salve every time you change his diaper.  I have two sons - one who is uncircumcised and one who is circumcised.  It is much harder to clean and care for the uncircumcised penis in the long run.  I definitely recommend circumcising your son.  <br>  <br>  Congrats on your pregnancy and I hope everything goes well!|`|OWOtKZmgaa	its not in your pregnancy book because circumcision is no longer recommend by the american cancer society or the AAP and is in decline which hopefully will continue.with mrsa now being contracted by circumcised babies and parents being better informed factually the cruelty and permanent disfigurement circumcision brings is now more well known. for instance of the 24,000 nerves a human penis has 20.000 are cut off in a circumcision and the foreskin gets sold on to pharmaceutical companies.|`|CesbKR1qaa	My baby boy hasn;t been done.Why does he have to be circumcised? I can't think of anything worse! Does he really need to be? It would be so painful for him. I shudder when i think about it! Good luck whatever you decide....|`|rBq189W1aa	Don't have him circumcised, and you won't have to worry about it. <br>  <br>  There's really no need for it in this day and age. My son hasn't had it done; he's eight years old now, and there have been no problems so far.|`|a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	dont listen to witch.<br>  <br>  it is NOT harder to clean an uncircumcised penis.<br>  <br>  in fact its the same as cleaning one that has been cut (with out the pain for the baby)<br>  <br>  even in the united states (where i assume your from) more then 50% of boys are no longer circumscised.<br>  <br>  it is not medically nescary at all.  people like to tell you its so hard to look after a boy thats not done.  its easy.  you just wipe it like you do if the boy is done.  the foreskin doesnt retract until the child is well over 3 years old.<br>  <br>  as long as you bath your child there is no special care required.  even pedatricians will tell you its not medcially nescary, nor any cleaner.  certainly in a bygone era when people didnt bath or didnt have access to running water it may of been cleaner, but that is no longer the case.<br>  <br>  have a think and weigh the pros and cons of wether your son needs a non estential painful surgery, get real honest information... not the ones that tell you how much harder it is and make a balanced decision.<br>  <br>  unfortunately in the usa its considered automatic to do this surgery still.<br>  <br>  in europe they havent routinely preformed circumcision for 40 + years.<br>  <br>  in australia (where i am from) it fell out of favour more then 20 years ago.<br>  <br>  both my sons arent circumcised.  my sisters two sons had a problem with the the holes in their penises (it has a medical term but i cant remember) because they werent circumcised the surgeon was able to use the forskin to reconstruct and fixed their penises.  if they had of been circumcised, they would of needed skin grafts to complete the operation.<br>  <br>  please think long and hard before having your son circumcised.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Enlightened people don't mutilate infants anymore.<br>  <br>  Both female and male circumcision are genital mutilation, which is cruel, inhumane and barbaric.<br>  <br>  Look at the site CIRCUMSTITIONS to see some of the adverse effects and complications that the doctors never disclose and in fact suppress.       Doctors make money from circumcision, and are very frequently members of the religions that try to mutilate all males by circumcision.<br>  <br>  I was a victim of the mutilation of circumcision, and suffered more than the usual loss of sensitivity which destroyed my sex life for years.<br>  <br>  Anyone with intelligence can see that a whole, natural and normal penis with a foreskin feels and functions far better than a penis that's been scarred and mutilated by circumcision.<br>  <br>  If you feel that circumcision is so beneficial, then why haven't you had a female circumcision done to yourself?<br>  <br>  You can experience firsthand the effects of being scarred, mutilated and deprived of sexual sensitivity for life.<br>  <br>  Look at some of the videos on the internet of infant circumcisions, and if it doesn't turn your stomach, then you're not human.       Animals are treated better than that!!!<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|yB5go5wbaa	all I did was wet a washcloth at every diaper change and kind of drip the water on it and dab it to clean it off.  Make sure you have vaseline too, to put in the front of his diaper where his penis will be so that the fresh wound doesn't stick to the diaper.  It was very easy and only took a week to completely heal - my son didn't seem bothered by it at all!<br>  <br>  congrats on the pregnancy and on having a boy :)|`|5ZvALiclaa	both my boys have not been circumsised as i don't believe its necessary. but this is what google brought up about caring for the wound <br>  <br>  "How do I care for my baby's penis after a circumcision?"<br>  Gently clean the area with water every day and whenever the diaper area becomes soiled. Some swelling of the penis is normal after a circumcision. A clear crust will probably form over the area. It normally takes 7 to 10 days for the penis to heal after a circumcision.<br>  <br>  After the circumcision, you may notice a small amount of blood on the baby's diaper. If the bloodstain is larger than the size of a quarter, call your doctor right away. In addition, you should call your doctor if a Plastibell device was used during the circumcision and the device doesn't fall off within 10 to 12 days. If there is a bandage on the penis instead of a Plastibell, the bandage should be changed each time you change your son's diaper. This will help prevent infection. Signs of infection also signal the need to call your doctor. These signs include a temperature of 100.4°F or higher, redness, swelling and/or a yellowish discharge.<br>  <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/men/reproductive/042.html" rel="nofollow">http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...</a><br>  <br>  best of luck|`|4arnbpUCaa	Initially, a circumcised penis requires more care and attention than one that is not circumcised. With a penis that is not circumcised, you do not have to do anything special, but with the circumcised one you need to deal with gauze, vaseline after every diaper change, and be attentive to make sure the wound doesn't get infected.|`|7aCH91ISaa	I don't know how to care it, but I do suggest you speak with your Doctor on the pros and cons of circumcision. There is really no reason that it is better for a child. My two oldest were not circumcised and have never had problems and they are 19 & 17.|`|WKtakdsOaa	Whatever you do dont get him circumsiced. Its barbaric and pointless
a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	at different times when my children were babies i made yoghurt for them.<br>  <br>  petit also seem to contain a lot of sugar.  you could try buying natural style yoghurt and seperating it into seperate containers.. or make your own using the easy yo yoghurt maker.<br>  <br>  i used the easi yo.... i would rinse the container out with boiled cooled water (to steralize it) then use cooled boiled water to mix up the mix with before putting it in to set.<br>  <br>  just to be safe that yoghurt is better introduced around 10ish months and not as early as other foods just incase of dairy intolerances.|`|08GDBedGaa	i use an organic natural yogurt and blend in strawberries, banana, raspberries, etc i put them in a funky coloured pot, voila!!|`|j5nVMVPNaa	yes its very good.  get a yoghut machine from your health shop|`|mhfgvvrJaa	I have never made yogurt but I have bought natural full fat yogurt and added some of my own pureed fruit.

4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	Firstly it is important you worry about yourself and getting through the operation.  Your baby of course will notice that it is not 'mum' who is with her, but babies, especially at that age are very adaptable and I am sure your mum will be the best substitute for you and give her all the love and affection that she needs.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with the operation, baby will be fine, just get yourself well.<br>  <br>  :)|`|386fa1284d4c180bfe964db1309fabd1aa	Yes - she will miss you, but if she is with somebody that she knows then she will be fine. It is very helpful for her development that she is used to staying with different (but familiar) people as this will help her to become more confident and independent. It is also important not to get too stressed or 'fussy' about leaving her, as this will make her far more upset than if you are calm and confident around her.|`|pZCWKlkVaa	At 4 months old it is difficult for the baby to "miss" anything. Its brain hasn't got what is called object permanence, this is where the baby learns that out of sight does not mean it doesn't exist. You can test to see if your baby has this as when you hide a toy they will look for it, small babies just start to play with something else. Having said that your baby knows you now and will be familiar with you. Although you won't exactly be missed there will probably be lots of smiles for you when you come back. <br>  Hope that helps. <br>  xx|`|MR9iBgafaa	I have a 5 month old and have often wondered this.  I'm putting her into nursery 3 days a week in May and wondering if she'll remember me lol!|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I wouldn't worry (though it is hard!).  At around that age I had to leave my son with my parents for two nights and he was fine.  He's 6 months now and when I leave him with someone whether it be 1 hour or 3 he is absolutely fine.  I don't think they're developed enough to notice as once you're out of sight, you're out of mind (harsh as it sounds).  If anything, he may be a little more clingy when you get back to him but he's probably too young for that still too..  hope operation goes well.
KlWWh3fgaa	I have no friends anymore <br>  <br>  I have no life ::: everything revolves around school, work, homework & my daughter. <br>  <br>  People ignorantly assume that I'm on welfare, when in fact I work my butt of to support the two of us !<br>  <br>  I have noticed that strangers are a lot less diligent to give up a seat on the bus, or to move out of the way when you are trying to get the stroller through a store entrance. <br>  <br>  And on more than one occasion, moms, who are older than me ::: I would assume mid 30-40s often comment on what I'm not doing right ie holding my daughter incorrectly, or giving her a pacifier when she looks old enough to be off them ... If I had a dime for everythime I have commented ''how is it any of your business'' I wouldn't have to work !!<br>  <br>  It just gets tiring after a while. Like we know we've made a mistake, we (minority of us) support ourselves, and are good moms, but still get treated like garbage ....|`|W3mN3EBuaa	Not a teen mother, but I went to continuation school with a lot of teen mothers, and I saw them treated horribly. They often had to endure insults and belittling in addition to frequent state harassment and intrusion. Hidden within harsh criticism of teen parenthood is that many adults consider adolescents to be children, despite the fact that adolescence is essentially a modern, artificial social construct that's only existed for about a century, and therefore non-sexual beings. Pregnancy is perhaps the most obvious sign that a person IS a sexual being, which likely causes a good deal of anger.<br>  <br>  Of course, what's most ironic is that teen parenthood can actually be a wise economic strategy for some poorer women, as my source indicates. It draws on the work of Hotz et al., as well as Geronimus and Korenmun.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	i was in my twenties when i had my kids, but i think a lot of people especially on here can be very cruel to young girls who may be, are or have been pregnant.

758cDKEFaa	its blood mixed with mucas (discharge) from the vagina.<br>  its hard to miss!|`|5ZvALiclaa	you'll know because its a goopey, gooey, egg-white type consistancy blob, or sometimes stringy, and is usually pink blood tinged or accompanied by very pale pink spotting. <br>  <br>  Its really very hard to miss and under normal circumstance is usually accompanied or very soon after by the first mild contractions.<br>  <br>  My first 'show' came out as a big blood tinged blob the size of a golfball after I had my stretch and sweep. The second one was more stringy and came out when I was washing myself in the shower but was still blood tinged (contractions came that afternoon) <br>  The third time it came out when i felt my first contraction and was again stringy but more runny and accompanied by pink spotting when i wiped. It was there for the next few times i went to the toilet.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|MR9iBgafaa	It's supposed to like a snotty discharge.

I lost my mucous plug at 38 weeks.  And my waters broke straight away.  If there is anything out of the ordinary (compared to everything you have experienced so far) best to call your midwife and explain the situation.  I rang when I saw that blood at 34 weeks and was told it was probably a show.  it means I am likely to deliver before my due date.|`|N2AKuvVkaa	It's a gross looking mucus plug. I know.

pZCWKlkVaa	No, your uterus is almost the same size as it was before you conceived so you can't feel it (unless you are able somehow to feel it normally!) It is tucked away in your pelvis so your pubic bone stops you feeling it... and protects it. After about 10-12 weeks it will pop about your pubic bone as it grows but it will be approximately another 4-8 weeks until you feel the baby moving. <br>  <br>  xx|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. Her uterus is well below her pelvic bone and will be until about the 13th week.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Your other answers are probably correct, as I've never been pregnant.<br>  <br>  However, the heart of a fetus begins to beat in 20 days.<br>  <br>  If death occurs when the heart stops, is this the beginning of life?|`|JkBbdg72aa	No, it would be too soon to be able to feel anything yet, considering that at a week it would still be just a microcoptic cell. You wouldn't be feeling anything yet for that matter.It would be months before you would even start to notice signs with your body. I think your just worried. Just remember if you don't want to get pregnant, use protection every time!|`|C53UlCdaaa	i started to feel things going on in my stomach just a week in to my pregnancy. only you know your body and what you are feeling.|`|YzCPY48qaa	i started to 'feel pregnant' 10 days after sex.got a positive test soon after wards.ithink it depends on how in tune or how well you know your own body.|`|SQw16c5Daa	No, sounds like ur scared u might be pregnant.

a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	sweet corn is fine.  i would hold off on the eggs a bit longer (over 12 months) as eggs can be a highly reactive food.<br>  <br>  in general once a child is older then 6 months using a little cows milk in their food is fine, unless they show an intolerance to it.<br>  <br>  again with fish i would tend to wait just a little longer as some kids react strongly to fish as well.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	you should not be giving her the egg whites. Scrambled yolks are fine with whole milk, if you want to use milk. No egg whites though.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Any milk is fine. Just make sure the eggs are completely cooked, not runny.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I'd use normal cows milk.  It's fine in cooking from 6 months.  One baby porridge jar (labeled 4-6 months) I bought for my son was 72% cows milk!  They just shouldn't have it as a drink until 1 year (though some say 9 months).
pZCWKlkVaa	You need to break down your choices:<br>  1: where are you going to put your baby... not with the child-minder who is messy, that sounds awful. With another one? Is there one? With yourself? In nursery? Where I live there is an amazing nursery that takes kids from 6 months, its great and really helps socialize the kids. <br>  With your job... how much do you love it? If you did childminding would you want to go back to it when your baby left for school? If yes that tells you something  about how much you want to do childminding. <br>  Would you be able to bring in enough money childminding? Is your house suitable? If yes then thats good!<br>  Ultimately it comes down to how much you love your job, if not a lot then childmining sounds the way forward. If you do really love it and would only be doing childminding for a bit of extra money when your child is too small for school then I think you should consider trying other childminders and/or nurseries. <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  xx|`|uP08b6K4aa	I would personally stay in the job you're currently in as you already work for them and it's unlikely you won't get the job, they wouldn't have even offered it to you if they thought you were unable to carry it out.<br>  <br>  Childminding isn't all it's cracked up to be, the hours can be awkward and it doesn't pay very well, not to mention the changes you need to make to your home to ensure it's safe for anyone's child.<br>  <br>  Have you tried contacting your local council for a list of approved childminders in your area or perhaps near to your place of work?<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|uzZuwtgXaa	First of all your child must come first. This must be a priority when looking for a child minder. I would quit my job rather than put the child somewhere unsuitable.  There really is not a lot you can do about the situation is there, but wait the situation out, there is an obvious need for good child minders so why not have a go? It would seem logical at the present time for you, regarding the money issue.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	Childminding is hard to get into.<br>  My mum looked into it and it was going to cost a fortune to get the house ready.<br>  Have you looked at daycare? In the uk you can get help towards the cost of childcare and there are a lot of OFSTED registered centres.|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Look for another childminder that keeps your child cleaner than on a filthy floor.  Look for another childminder for a few more days before you give up your work.

You may be overeacting about nothing.<br>  <br>  You need to buy a pregnancy test and take it, or 2. And make sure in a week later take another one just in case. I took one when I was due and it was negative and I took one a month later and it was positive.<br>  <br>  If you do receive a positive test you need to consult your doctor or go see a gynachoigist. Then you need to make your decision.<br>  <br>  The withdrawl method is the worst possible method avaliable.|`|gRWzLHVEaa	Have you had your period since? If you have menstruates then you are not pregnant. Are you on the birth control pill? The birth control pill will help regulate your cycle so you get your period regularly once a month, every 21 days. You need to talk to your mother or father if you plan on continuing to have sex at sch a young age. If they are good parents they will take you to your doctor and get you on the pill. Remember though that even the birth control pill is not 100% effective so get your boyfriend to wear a condom as well otherwise you will live a life of worry every month until your period comes. <br>  Of course, the best method to ensure you don't get pregnant is abstinence! If you don't want to get pregnant and are not responsible enough to use protection then you need to stop having sex! Think of your future. You don't want a child at your age|`|AA10779494	Pregnancy is not for the sake of you on this world. It is for the right of the baby to be born in this world.

It doesn't sound like you want to be pregnant so Lets hope your not as there are enough single teen mums out there.  If you are then good luck, coz its hard work, and get yourself a job to support you and the baby, so that people who do work don't have to pay for your baby.<br>  <br>  If you are not pregnant, stop sleeping with boys and fo find something productive to do with your life.

1tmX7xbRaa	the first thing you have to understand is that although your mom pay be paying a little more attention to the baby it's NOT because she loves you any less. babies just need lots of attention. but a parent could never love a child less. don't think of the baby as taking love away from you think of her as bringing more love into your family circle. and at least out of the whole thing you will have a baby sister who will grow up looking up to you. you can teach her new things and show her the world in a way your parents can't. i think you should talk to your mom because she will be able to reassure you better then anyone here can. but like i said don't ever fear that your mom will love you less because as a parent i myself just don't think it's possible. like i said sometimes it may seem like it because of the attention the new baby will get but don't take that personally. having a new baby in the family is exciting for everyone but at the same time babies need LOTS of care and attention especially in their first few months.|`|3IXDx9nhaa	That is Sooo not the case!  I have an 11 year old girl who wants a brother or sister but unfortunately I am too old to give that to her.  I am sure in reality she would feel the same way a bit but be happy that for the rest of your life you will have a sibling.  You can deal with it a couple of ways; but I think the best way is to be the Best Big Sister and of course be a good daughter and support your mum.  You also should sit down with your mum and have a long talk about the baby, your relationship and the changes and tell her about your concerns and feelings!  It will be difficult for a few months until you all get into a routine.  Just remember to love your new sibling, he/she isn't there to complicate your life. They just happened to be born into your family.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	I worried when i was pregnant with my second son that i may not be able to love it as much as i loved my first son. I did not think it was possible to love anyone else as much as i loved him but when number 2 came alon i instantly fell head over heels in love with him too and i love them both the same just as your mum will you. You will realise this when you are older and have kids of your own. I'm sure ul wonder what all the fuss was about. Just because she starts loving someone else does not mean she will EVER stop loving you or love you any less.<br>  <br>  Speak to her about your problems, she'll probably rather know how you feel instead of u keeping it bottled up|`|Q8tf4B5taa	there is no need to be worried at all, i thought i couldnt love anything more than my daughter first born then my son came along i love him just the same.

That is so not true! I'm also thirteen, and i have a baby sister. For the first couple years, she WILL get more attention than you. But thats only because she needs it to survive!

PDotv2Hsaa	Get a third opinion - I'm serious - and this time, ask for a Senior Consultant. I'm not saying that normal gynaes are not competent but at least a more senior doctor would have seen enough cases to advise you better. Tell him the background of what's transpired between you and both doctors. It's worth it - it involves your child's well being.

We'll listen to a lot of music, but hardly rap. I don't like rap very much, neither do my kids. Some Rappers are talented, some are not. Some rappers you could actually understand the song & the words coming out of their mouth, and i have no clue why, but why do they need to have gold in their mouth?. My kids like a lot of music except rap. We like rock,country,pop..whatever. It's the kids' choices what they like and the parents can decide whether or not they listen to it. I don't hate rap and i don't go around stating that, i just don't enjoy the music!. I was born in 1977 and my father was a huge rock fan. You know, Led Zepplin, Lynrd Skynrd.. everything. I also didn't stick to rock growing up, and go around saying other music sucks and rock is clearly "the best". Otherwise, unlike rap, the jonas brothers and all those other people you can actually listen to what they're saying without needing to translate it. Rock,pop,whatever is singing. Rap is just rambling on and on.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of rap that' is pointless:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw6GuBbY2Ss" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw6GuBbY2...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's an example of good rap ( Is that even POSSIBLE?)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QedKFQLBc4U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QedKFQLBc...</a><br>  <br>  ^^ That's catchy and the kids love it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, take the rap that is pointless and compare it to the one below it. My kids love that song, and i can actually enjoy listening to it.<br>  <br>  My kids still like Jonas brothers,Miley Cyrus..who cares? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --Chris P--|`|yxtMLgN8aa	I don't think rap music is bad, I just wouldn't approve of my children listening to music with bad words in them while they are in my house. To me though some of these songs are just soooo dumb, I wonder why people listen to them. And I am so tired of hearing lil wayne. I can't stand his voice. I do listen to a little bit of everything, but am starting to get away from hip hop and r&b music and "rap". My boyfriend would def choose to listen to 2pac though. but he also listens to eric clapton, tool, otis rush, led zeppelin, dr. dre. It's your own opinion of what is good. I just get tired of hearing all the bad words and people referring to licking a lollipop as something to do with sex. It's ridiculous.<br>  <br>  By the way, you should list your fav artists to listen to so I can hear it and then I can judge the music to better understand your point of view.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	This is a parenting question forum... so the idea is while 2pac himself spoke of actual real situations and trying to get the community to pick itself up and make life better in the ghetto.  But beyond 2pac, if you had children would you let them listen to rap that has been made in the last 15 years, as it has gone downhill from Run DMC and 2pac?|`|ETqZU5D9aa	That made no sense at all and I didn't really get what you were trying to defend here. Very confusing....<br>  <br>  However, people are entitled to like whatever kind of music they want to. There is nothing wrong with rap music if that's what you like. I myself like country so where do I fit into your little rant?|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Uh...news flash.There are OTHER sorts of music than rap and rock, and music written before the 60s, you know.|`|aJfBtT9iaa	you could of made a better argument if you said metal that shyt should not be listened by any one.|`|8f892b4972d7cb015a31e859e2be573caa	You said FOB twice o_o.<br>  <br>  By the way, Fall Out Boy isn't mainstream. Only the singles are mainstream. So this is really a case of posers and not hypocrites. And I don't consider Disney people to be rock.<br>  <br>  So really, YOU'RE a hypocrite.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Grab your gun and knife,go into the street and make a few funny signs with your hands,grab your crotch,say a few FU^K YOU'S,then go back inside and start being a responsible human being.....|`|fdnbXfvfaa	People are entitled to have their own opinion weather it be different to yours or not.<br>  <br>  So now what do you have to say?

I prefer unusual names myself. But, i would say, choose the name that has most meaning to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, i see now that, that is the full name. Keep it then because, you have two names that have meaning to you. And i agree with OASISROCKSUK lol. <br>  <br>  Personally i would remove the Keith because, it doesn't quite go. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope i helped :) x|`|9xz6RcCMaa	Too many K's mate. <br>  Why not put Helen in front of Katie?<br>  <br>  Personally, it's a tongue twister.

I agree with others that it would be better to leave out if it doesn't have particular sentimental value.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	well make sure you keep the Helen in because without it her initials would be "KKK"|`|vjiQLaaQaa	too many Ks|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I think it has too many K sounds.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	I personally think there are too many Ks.

ROJans2Taa	I agree with you, I have a cat that has recently taken to scratching and my son is only 6 mths, my first step will be to declaw her but if she resorts to biting (which she has) regardless of my sons behaviour it`ll be out the door for her, I love my cat, but I love my son more, and 2 year olds arnt known for being gentle,lol. I use to grab cats and squeeze them until I was 5, my mom said people would have to put their cats in a separate room when id come because id torment them endlessly, of course once I ws bigger i learned how to be gentle, my point is some kids are rough, they dont mean to be, they just are, keep teaching your son in the mean time but if it doesn't work out, the dog has to go|`|U7oJrc3faa	The kid is trying to ride the dog, that could seriously injure the poor little pup. LOL @ 'the dog is creating a DISTRACTION for my son'. Seriously? a dog creating a distraction? If you let your kid get away with bad stuff like abusing a dog he's going to act like that for life.Kids shouldn't be able to get away with what ever they want, and dogs shouldn't have to be outside in a cage.|`|45e970b2e25dcf51734629fdc5f7a11baa	i would keep the because it needs love and care and by putting it in the kennel s/he isn't getting that. you need to tell your kid only once and if he doesn't listen put him in timeout. Then he'll see that he can't bother the dog anymore. also explain to him why he can't bother the dog. i have a neice who used to do this and her mom would talk to her about why she can't bother the dog and if she didnt listen she would be put into timeout. You seem like a great person, but you need to be fair.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	I think that your son is taunting the dog and the dog should not be punished to go into his crate or outside.  Have you had the dog long?  I wouldn't expect your son to behave around him if he is new but if the dog has been around for a long time I see no reason why your son should not be able to mind you.  Everyone is different with their methods of punishment but I would pop his little behind once next time he is taunting the dog.. (and if you allow it to happen for a long time then he may grow up and be cruel to animals??)|`|f98093c5efc4ff7a072f987cac7a9d42aa	I'd have to say I agree with your husband. Does the child get 3 warnings when he's about to run out into traffic or stick a bobby pin in the wall outlet? No. And messing around with the dog could be another danger to him if the dog decides to snap at him. He's 2, as is mine, and mine knows that he doesn't even get one warning when it comes to being mean to the dogs. He goes straight to time out immediately. Of course he didn't know that right away. It took a few trips to time out before he got it. Good luck.|`|ll5xkkwnaa	I think your child comes before anything!!! He is only 2 years old and doesnt know any better and so a "beating" would not only be cruel.. it would not teach him anything. He just needs to be taught... and that takes a while. He's still a baby himself.|`|EiWvaYqzaa	I agree with you, the child is only two years old. Too him it is just a game. When the child gets a little older he will understand that he cannot taunt a dog like that and he'll quit.|`|aHtMxB1Daa	i agree with your husband.  if you keep thinking the way your thinking your son is going to think you have no authority over him, and no respect as he gets older too.<br>  <br>  think about it.|`|5Ep4VOJJaa	I think your husband is right. No offence to you. The dog could hurt your child if he pisses him off that much. You should tell your child straight out that the dog can bite his face off and your child can't.|`|fToG0uSbaa	I agree with your husband.|`|xhkWNiZIaa	Your sons bothering your dog. <br>  The dog isnt doing anything..|`|VTGyAHdsaa	I agree with you. I have had to separate my dogs from my son.  I am not "punishing" the dogs...they are simply in a separate room with their food and water with a gate in the doorway.  I would rather have them separated while my 2-year-old son learns to treat them gently than take a trip to the emergency room because one of the dogs bit my son.  My son is more important to me than my dogs, and I am not willing to risk injury to him.  I have seen the results of dog bites, and it is not pretty.|`|zruhNGKbaa	Get that CHILD under control - RIGHT NOW! <br>  <br>  First time - Instruct child on proper behavior <br>  Second Time - Confront and Re-instruct child on proper behavior.<br>  Third time - Confront - Apply Corrective non-injurious pain to the glutious-maximus ( Time Out's DO NOT WORK - they are a horrible idea! ) and Re-instruct child on proper behavior - conclude with Loving and Hugging. Repeat as needed. Some 2 year olds require several doses before the foolishness bound within their heart is properly purged. <br>  <br>  Failure to properly correct the young child leads to imprisonment and possible death of the child and untold heartaches for the parent who could have made a difference. It is your responsibility and obligation to prevent the child from doing dangerous things. Teasing the dog is only a symptom of the root issue.|`|Zr1APGtmaa	Don't get rid of neither one of em!!! Kids need to lear how to take care of animals, threatening  him isn't going to solve the issue either. He should be toughed that dogs can bite and also feel pain, this way maybe you can teach him new ways to play with the puppy. <br>  Besides it's not a good idea for a child to do something or don't do something just because he's afraid of his daddy, this only teaches him to be afraid of his dad not to be gentle to a dog.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	your husband sounds like a dick <br>  and the kid is just learning and exploring the dog trying to see how much he can do. pets are good for children <br>  i vote get rid of hubby
AA11138222	I think Vivienne is beautiful, and Salem is just okay. Using the names together I think I like Salem Vivienne better.|`|XkWTsyJdaa	i LOVE that. omg im totally gonna name one of my kids that one day.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I like both names but not really together.

Salem is gay.|`|d6c5091f4ae22232c337d5a7245302feaa	Salem is a place where they hung "witches" and a brand of cigarettes.  Horrible name.|`|92KLc7PFaa	i looooove vivienne but not so much on salem.
QWTLw9DEaa	www.nameberry.com does.<br>  <br>  For example, they will show the international variations of Alexandra. Like, how Alessandra is Spanish and Italian. (Which is kind of a bad example because this actually under a name list)<br>  <br>  But, Camilla, for example, shows international variations. One example is: Kamilka and Milla are Polish for Camilla<br>  <br>  So yeah, go there! :)
F12ekJ7Saa	Well done! You are going to be such a great mother =)<br>  <br>  You are already making a change and are trying to be healthy for your baby and yourself.

I stopped smoking 6 weeks ago because I found out I was pregnant and it hasn't bothered me one bit. Sometimes I do get the odd craving usually after a meal but it soon passes and if anyone I'm with has one it makes me feel sick so even if I did have one I don't think i'd be able to smoke it anyway because it would make me sick! Your body will make it easy for you because it wants what's best for your baby<br>  Good luck - stay strong and you'll be fine!x|`|ULZv6ynwaa	Well done and goood luck (: <br>  Think how proud your child will be to know its mummy gave it the best chance (:|`|4b20f1516c0014a204a6974df7d09a78aa	Good for you!!  It will be worth it... and your gonna be a great mum!|`|on5NQxhkaa	That's so great!!! Good job, you SHOULD be proud of yourself, thats not an easy thing to do.<br>  <br>  I am in a similar boat, I just quit smoking 2 weeks ago.. I am not pregnant, but I'm just quitting because I know I need to. It definently took some balls to throw out all my cigs and lighters lol, so I know what you're going through.<br>  <br>  Keep an update, if you ever want to talk you can email me like for support or something... I think it's always easier to do things when you have someone to relate to on things.<br>  <br>  You are doing such a great thing for you and baby!
ZvkX9uNraa	Congratulations! I have had 2 miscarriages as well, and I am currently 20w5d with a healthy baby girl. In the beginning I was nervous, but I just tried to leave it in God's hands. You must remain positive, just because you have had previous losses is not an indication of what will happen with future pregnancies. Make sure you get to the OB early and insist that they put you on progesterone suppositories, and a daily folic acid pill. Just try as best as you can to relax, your baby deserves a happy, and not stressed out environment. Best of luck!!|`|AlxMp9l3aa	Ive had over 10 miscarriages and 1 ectopic, and am now 8 weeks pregnant again and having problems AGAIN, but i have had 2 successful pregnancy's and now have a son and a daughter, so it can happen.<br>  You can only take one day at a time, and try to do things to take your mind off it, don't do anything too strenuous to endanger your pregnancy,  you can ask your doctor to check you hcg levels which should double every 48-72hrs.  If you get any sharp pains then talk to your midwife, get booked in asap so the hospital can keep a check on you, my doctors have been doing my hcg levels every couple of days to see if they are going up and im booked in for a scan also, but you are not far enough on for that, 6 weeks is usually the earliest baby can be seen.<br>  <br>  KEEP CALM<br>  TAKE IT EASY<br>  GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR ASAP<br>  <br>  AND GOOD LUCK!|`|NCcpjBL5aa	I too have had two miscarriages, and like you - found out i am pregnant with the help of three tests!<br>  I am terrified of losing this baby, it is such a wanted child and i am madly in love with it already.. My husband and i are eager to get to that scan as well... It's such an exciting time, i think we should both go with the advice from a previous poster.. And just count every day as being pregnant as a blessing. <br>  <br>  Good luck huni xx|`|EwK9iZj6aa	Sweetie I know exactly how you feel! I am having symptoms of pregnancy 4 days after conception and anxiety is on the rise! Try deep breathing to ease the anxiety, it will all work out for you!

I was 2 days late when I got my positive as well.  I'm so happy for you!<br>  <br>  Well, just relax.  Get a book on pregnancy and read up.  Don't worry dear.  Not every pregnancy turns out to be a miscarriage.  =)|`|ROJans2Taa	its normal, ecspecially after miscarriage, I was so scared the first 12 weeks, even after it wasn'nt until I could feel my son move, my only advice, take one day at a time, and each day your still pregnant think of it as a victory, because the further you get the less chance of miscarriage, best luck|`|6j9Lb83Caa	well what you can do to release your anxiety is kind of just relax alot you know treat your self right make sure others dont put any extra stress on your shoulders you dont need that plus did you know adding stress and extra anxiety could be the cause of an misscarrage? well it can so you kknow just kind of relax eat healthy be excited b ut dont stress your sefl out pray to god and im pretty sure he will take care of everything, have a good one and i wish you the best of luck.|`|EnKFZ7Roaa	I understand how you feel. I had an early m/c at 6 weeks and the second time I became pregnant I was on pins and needles. I had awful morning sickness this time and that helped calm my fears some and I just prayed that everything was okay. I went in for my first appointment and saw the heartbeat and at that point I was relieved. I am now 15 weeks and everything seems to be going well. Thank god. <br>  I would call your doctor and see if they will start checking your levels and make sure they are doubling and maybe have an early ultrasound at 7 weeks or so. Do not be afraid to call your doctor and ask for more frequent check ups if that will help u feel better. I wish you a happy and healthy pregnancy.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	My friend was the same way. She had 2 miscarriages before and she is now 22 weeks pregnant. She had more appointments than previous pregnancies. They even did more ultrasounds to calm her so that she could see the heartbeat. Best of luck to you!|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Take extra care around the 3rd month because that's when miscarriages most occur.
R1cey1Evaa	NO!|`|F7tyzrMzaa	I think it's far too common. It's not a terrible name, but I know so many Ashley's (boys & girls) that I've got sick of it. I much prefer Ashlynn. That's a nice name.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I used to, but not anymore. Too many unpleasant Ashleys have entered my life and ruined the name completely.|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	I love the name Ashley.|`|1n7Uezzpaa	Personally, I love the name in a sense because well...it's my name! ha!

6yD5k9Azaa	I think it's pretty :]<br>  i would probably chose the spelling Kalea though.<br>  when i first read it i thought Hawaiian before i even read what you wrote.<br>  it does not sound "ghetto"<br>  <br>  Kalea Aveline would be a beautiful name (A-va-line)|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I quite like it. If you were planning on having their nickname as Leah, I would use Kaleah. Otherwise I would use Kalia.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|KyhnSRrJaa	Unless you are really Hawaiian and are naming her for your heritage, skip the creative spelling and made up names... save them for puppies!|`|NePgB9b2aa	It's alright, not bad. I much prefer Dalia/Dahlia though. :)|`|ZvJCu3qPaa	I don't think it sounds Ghetto. I really like it. It's a very pretty name. I like the first spelling of it too: Kalia. Very pretty. :).|`|s01IhkOPaa	That's a very pretty name.  I like "Kalia" the best because "Kalea" or "Kaleah" might be mispronounced as "Kaylee."|`|rh5vbol9aa	I'm sorry but it sounds hittitien, sumerian, egyiptian, babylonian etc.|`|fjXeIMUdaa	Love it!|`|4U7327Mzaa	I don't like it.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I know you spelled the pronunciation, but I don't understand which syllable gets the accent.<br>  <br>  Looking at Kalia, I would say ku-LEE-yuh.  Is that right?  Does it have a great meaning?  I bet it does.  If you can make people pronounce it right, I like Kalia better than the others, though those are acceptable to me too.<br>  <br>  I think that's a pretty name.<br>  <br>  TX Mom

2ObqoJbKaa	Don't stress too much about it. It is technically possible, but its such a small chance that its barely worth worrying about. Its very hard to get pregnant like that. Just make sure you get your next period. I think your most likely not pregnant though. good luck.|`|YeTvHsqkaa	it`s true that there is a chance, but don`t worry, the probabilty is too small, and you don`t win nothing if you worried......|`|8sWaWQWGaa	Just wait to see if your period arrives next month.|`|wObmwK1uaa	you can get pregnant just of pre- *** you won't know if you are pregnant yet though it is too early to tell.

When I first look at it, to me, I'd pronounce it "Possy"<br>  Nusha: Don't like.<br>  Weerk: Almost reminds me of "weird", so I don't like it.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be so blunt, but those are just my opinions. Good luck!|`|KyhnSRrJaa	I'm not arabic, so if you put some pronounciations it would help me to pick better :)|`|VV74ysCmaa	I don't like these much, but out of them, I like<br>  Katash|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	katash!
fnj8BsoGaa	In order of preference:<br>  Amelia: I LOVE THIS NAME!<br>  Gabriella: Pretty.<br>  Lily: I like it.<br>  Olivia: Great name, a bit overused though.<br>  Genevieve: Fairly pretty name, I've heard of it but never met anyone with this name.<br>  Haylee: It's alright. I like Haylee better than Hailey though. <br>  Nicolette: I don't like it very much. It reminds me a bit of Nicorette (nicotine gum). Besides this, it's an alright name in my opinion.<br>  Jordy: Eh, it's alright as a NICKNAME, but I don't like it as a full name. I know a girl named Jordyn, which is a pretty name, but her nickname is Jordy. <br>  Lucy: Not fond of this name for a human. I know too many cats named Lucy.<br>  Clara: I don't like this name.

hSTNMnFPaa	You've got some gorgeous names here! My favorites:<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  <br>  ? Nova Madelyn~ Nova is very pretty and very uncommon. Madelyn is nice, though I prefer the spelling Madeleine- just looks cleaner and more professional.<br>  <br>  ? Isla Zipporah~ Isla is just a stunning, underused gem that will age wonderfully. Zipporah is interesting. It's a Hebrew name, but I could see a lot of people thinking it's made-up.<br>  <br>  ? Carys Penelope Rose~ Carys is my second-favorite girl name of all time! So uncommon and has a lovely sound to it- plus, it means "love" and you can't really get a better meaning than that. Penelope is also a favorite of mine. Very pretty. Rose is a little filler, but with two stunning, unusual names in front of it, I think it'd be okay.<br>  <br>  My favorite would have to be Carys, though Isla is a close second.<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  ? Levi Stellan~ Levi has really been starting to grow on me as of late. Really cute for when he's little, but still strong enough for when he's an adult. Stellan isn't my favorite, though. Reminds me too much of Joseph Stalin.<br>  <br>  ? Henry Atticus~ Henry is very cute and very classic. Atticus isn't the best (I honestly prefer Porter) but Henry Porter looks and sounds too much like Harry Potter.<br>  <br>  ? Leo Thaddeus~ Leo is definitely one of my favorite boy names. Just gorgeous. Thaddeus, again, isn't my favorite, but as it's a middle name, I don't think it matters too much.<br>  <br>  My favorite from the boys is definitely Leo.<br>  <br>  Lucy, Sebastian, Jude, Bishop and Carys.<br>  Lucy, Sebastian, Jude, Bishop and Leo.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  ? Qǖ???|`|34VXCyvVaa	Nova Madelyn<br>  Charlotte Amelia<br>  Vivienne Isabelle<br>  Stellan Hartley<br>  Henry Porter<br>  Theodore Benjamin Asher<br>  <br>  I don't like most of the names, although Stellan Hartley is interesting and different.  I think Aniston will ALWAYS be associated with Jennifer Aniston.  Nova may always be associated with Novalee Nation in that book and movie with Natalie Portman.  Isla may always be associated with Isla Fisher.  Amelia may always be associated with The Princess Diaries.  Carys may always be associated with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Girls top: Nova Madelyn, Carys Penelope Rose & Vivienne Isabelle. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't chose Aniston. It would be an ugly first name. Once I say it a few times, it doesn't sound as bad, but it still doesn't thrill me.<br>  <br>  Boys Top:Henry Atticus.|`|ZaxpQSO5aa	I hate all of them, but Aniston Meah is definately the nicest. But I understand how people would associate that with Jennifer.|`|QWTLw9DEaa	Ok, I'm going to be completely honest with all of these.<br>  <br>  -Nova Madelyn - I really dislike Nova. I think of like Supernova, and a star and such. It just isn't a name to me. Madelyn is very pretty, on the other hand. I love that name very much, and I think you should use that as the first name instead.<br>  --Suggestions: Madelyn Noelle or Noella Madelyn<br>  <br>  -Isla Zipporah - I think Isla is very pretty, but I think of an island when I hear this name. Zipporah is just downright wrong. It's like a Zipper! I really, really, really strongly dislike Zipporah. It's too over the top.<br>  --Suggestions: Isla Zoey or Isla Maria<br>  <br>  -Avis Leontine - I hate this name so much. Avis makes me think of a pelvis. Or some kind of nerd. Isn't it a car rental company, too? I don't know. Anyway, Leontine is just strange, as well.<br>  --Suggestions: Ava Lillian or Ava Leona<br>  <br>  -Carys Penelope Rose - I actually love this one! Carys is very pretty (and I doubt they will pronounce this wrong, it's quite simple, actually), and Penelope Rose flows beautifully with it.<br>  --Suggestions: None!<br>  <br>  -Charlotte Amelia - I simply adore both names. Amelia is on my favorites, and I just love it. Charlotte is timeless and so pretty.<br>  --Suggestions: None!<br>  <br>  -Aniston Meah - I strongly dislike both names. Aniston will always be associated with Jennifer Aniston. And, Meah is spelled incorrectly. Mia is the correct and pretty spelling of it. I understand your wanting to have the nickname Annie, because I really love that nickname, too.<br>  --Suggestions: Annabel Mia, Annalee Mia, or Annalise Mia<br>  <br>  -Vivienne Isabelle - absolutely no complaints. I love this name, it's gorgeous, and since it has meaning to you, it makes it even better. No, I doubt she will be associated to Angelina Jolie's daughter.<br>  --Suggestions: None!<br>  <br>  -Viola Josephine - My only problem with this is that when I hear Viola, I instantly think of the instrument. Josephine is very pretty, though<br>  --Suggestions: Violet Josephine<br>  <br>  -Levi Stellan - While I don't care for Stellan, I love Levi. It's wonderful, and Stellan works very well with it.<br>  --Suggestions: Levi Stephen or Levi Samuel<br>  <br>  -Stellan Hartley - Once again, I don't care for Stellan. I also don't like Hartley very much, either. It makes me think of Harley which has become quite an annoying name to me.<br>  --Suggestions: Slater Henry<br>  <br>  -Henry Porter - I simply adore Henry! And Porter just flows so well with it. Henry is a classic name that will never, in my opinion, be out of style.<br>  --Suggestions: None!<br>  <br>  -Leo Thaddeus - I love Leo! I really do. I just don't like Thaddeus. It makes me think of a suitcase for some reason, so definitely not the best in my opinion... Lol. Plus, it's just very old sounding<br>  --Suggestions: Leo Thomas or Leo Tyler or (looking at the next one) Leo Benjamin Asher<br>  <br>  -Theodore Benjamin Asher - I love this name. Absolutely wonderful and of the best boy's names on the list. Theodore is a nice, classic name, and so is Benjamin. I like Asher thrown in there, for a little modern twist. It's absolutely wonderful<br>  --Suggestions: None!<br>  <br>  top three (some might include my suggestions):<br>  Carys Penelope Rose, Charlotte Amelia, and Vivienne Isabelle<br>  Henry Porter, Leo Thomas, and Theodore Benjamin Asher<br>  <br>  Which ones will work best with your other children:<br>  Vivienne Isabelle - All of the names seem to have a classic name, and a more "modern" name, which this one feels like it has. No matter how much I adore Charlotte Amelia, Vivienne fits in the best with your other children<br>  <br>  Henry Porter - As I said before, all of the names have a classic name and a modern twist, which this one has as well. I simply adore this name and think a Henry would fit in great with your group. Oh! Or Leo Asher. Lol<br>  <br>  Sorry this was so long! :) Good luck|`|yv94euDBaa	I like:<br>  <br>  Nova (Madelyn is to popular) Madeleine is better.<br>  Charlotte Amelia<br>  Aniston Meah (Although, it reminds me of Jennifer Aniston, but that's not a bad thing.) It's a cute name.<br>  Viola Josephine<br>  <br>  Henry Atticus (I prefer Atticus Henry)<br>  Leo Thaddeus<br>  Theodore Benjamin Asher<br>  <br>  I think Joesphine Charlotte would go very well with the other names. And Atticus Henry for a boy. Although Theodore Benjamin Atticus is very good to.<br>  <br>  Very good names, I love them!|`|N5EhfDX2aa	GIRLS<br>  Nova Madelyn/Viola Josephine - Love Madelyn and Josephine <br>  Carys Penelope Rose - Flows well, people will pron.

I think Leontine is a little out there, but it's not like a middle name gets used on a daily basis. I don't like the other names. I think that Aniston will def be associated w/ JA.<br>  I also like Levi, Gage & Leo, don't really like the other names. <br>  I think Charlotte and Leo go w/ Lucy, Sebastian, Jude and Bishop best.|`|OhaosQ14aa	1. Charlotte Amelia <br>  2. Isla Zipporah<br>  <br>  1. Henry Atticus<br>  2. Theodore Benjamin Asher<br>  3.

Possible nicknames could be: Theo, Ben, Benji, Ash
DUeCxgpOaa	I like Ruby Hope|`|VGij9p0Taa	Libby Joy May - this name is a little too informal and I feel to many Y's I think Elizabeth Joy May would be better, using Libby as a nickname due to the fact that it makes the name slightly more formal however saying this Libby is a cute name but changing it to Elizabeth just makes the name age better. <br>  <br>  Charlotte Ann Faith - Charlotte is a very classy traditional name that isn't as popular as it used to be. Charlie isn't a good nickname but the most common nickname personally I prefer Lottie. Ann and Faith are great middle names. <br>  <br>  Ruby Hope - this is the cutest name on the list however not the best. It is a very short name that does age well. Hope is very wholesome sounding however Ruby isn't a name I'm too keen on I prefer other gem stone names, Amber, Pearl etc. <br>  Hope this helped!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I like Charlotte Ann Faith|`|61NKzPzMaa	Libby Joy May - Libby is a nickname. Joy and May are lovely. How about Elizabeth Joy May? or Elizabeth May Joy which flows better. Elizabeth Joy and Elizabeth May are also great.<br>  <br>  Charlotte Ann Faith - The name is nice but Anne looks better than Ann. Charlotte Anne Faith?<br>  <br>  Ruby Hope - Pretty. I love Ruby but not that keen on Hope.|`|8DF64P7Gaa	Libby Joy is okay, and Libby May is okay, but not Libby Joy May.<br>  Charlotte Anne is great! Charlotte Faith is okay, but again, not Charlotte Anne Faith<br>  Ruby Hope is a bit odd. i love the name Ruby but with the middle name Hope its doesnt go well. what about Ruby Louise?|`|9CAXUgOZaa	I like Ruby Hope :)|`|63g2HKKxaa	i like joy and may|`|gU3BeNQ5aa	i don't like them the way you have them.<br>  <br>  may nd ruby are nice!<br>  <br>  libby, charlotte , faith and hope are a BIG no no in my books.<br>  <br>  i like the sonud of ruby may!<br>  <br>  My favourite girls name is lilly may or lilly rose.|`|GTKXq7A1aa	I like charlotte|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	Libby and Ruby are cute but I'm not crazy about the combos.|`|5QtseYWuaa	I like libby and hope|`|6gM98TRjaa	they are all nice<br>  i like ruby and may|`|sFKgWed0aa	hope|`|yY6qTloXaa	i like libby, charlotte, faith. :)|`|eV74FwMoaa	I think they are all lovely feminine names, very classic.  My only hangup is with the name Libby, to me it's too nicknamey.  You may want to give a full name that she can always fall back on, such as Elizabeth, and just use the nickname.|`|aAJd36TVaa	Ruby Hope is nice<br>  Libby Joy or Libby May sound pretty but not Libby Joy May, it doesn't flow too well, same with Charlotte Ann Faith, It would sound better if it was just Charlotte Ann or Charlotte Faith. <br>  <br>  :)|`|xSURVvqZaa	i would saay none.<br>  Those names are not up to date at all.<br>  Give that baby a good name.<br>  Something to remember.|`|aAwfWccXaa	they are all beautiful names x|`|hCfm9mxXaa	Libby is the only one that might be good.
G6eBvDz8aa	At the baby shower I got TONS AND TONS of wipes an diapers.. well I categorized them in her closet from sensitive to normal to the like, dollar store brands people got me.. I'm using the sensitive then the rest in order down to the dollar store ones being last.. I figure by then her little hiney won't be as sensitive! haha. She has never gotten diaper rash an seems just fine with me using wipes on her since day one!|`|QP46eVi4aa	They give you diaper wipes in the hospital to use they are soft and you can use them <br>  <br>  I buy huggies in the red container with disney caracters not sure what they are called but hey are thick but also so soft on a new born but and they work great cause some of that stuff that comes out of there but is thick and gets stuck <br>  <br>  but it is safe to use wipes <br>  <br>  you don't want to use bubble bath on a baby|`|1enIWBGnaa	Don't listen to everything you hear.  The only time you need to be careful is when bathing a baby.  Don't get water on the cord until it comes off by itself.<br>  Johnson's baby products are safe to use at anytime.|`|M4Ij7Pqtaa	I used them and mine, 4, were all just fine.  And the baby wash and lotion.  Ummm....that's the best smell in the whole world a freshly bathed baby with the lotions!|`|WVPRUzLuaa	i have 1 son and twin girls honestly who ever told you that it is a load of rubbish i have and every one else i know have used baby wipes and also when your at the hospital and a nurse comes to weigh your baby and its done a poo they use wipes if it was bad your midwife would of told you that because they don't Let you worm up ur bottles in microwaves because it burns the baby's mouth cause microwaves leave hot spots in your bottle i am telling you wipes will not hurt you baby and nether dose bubble baths cause they teach you in hospital how you should bath your baby and they use johnsons|`|CRR3uJL9aa	you can use Johnson's baby bath when they are born but only a tiny bit in the baby bath. And when you change the baby's bum you can always use cotton buds and warm water as i did with my daughter. A when you change his nappy make sure his thingy is pointed down as you will get a lot of wet baby grows, hope this has helped you a bit with your question|`|md9rI5Y6aa	i used pampers sensitive baby wipes, they are meant for newborns.  my son has very sensitive skin, he's 4 months and i still use those wipes.  at the hospital i was given soft wash cloths and told to wet them with warn water.  i don't use johnsons baby products because as i already stated my sons skin is too sensitive,  i use aveeno baby products and eucerin baby aquaphor products, they are a bit more pricey not too much, they are under $10 but worth every penny|`|jvFWNuiXaa	I gave sponge baths to both my children. did not have any problem with that. I also used wipes. Dont worry about it too  much. I use pampers wipes i found them to be the best. if u want u can use pampers sensitive wipes.|`|bjEGKOp2aa	Most baby products should be okay, just check the label and check with your midwife or other health care professional. in Aust there's a product available from chemist called Aqueous cream (I think that's how it's spelt). This can be used in baby's bathwater and for cleaning etc as it's PH neutral. You can also use sorbalene cream for cleaning and washing. Both products are inexpensive. Also, when washing baby's clothes try to go for something without all the added fragrances etc etc and just use pure soap flakes or other gentle, safe for sensitive skin products(read the ingredients labels). Another great product for baby if they get dry, cracked or chaffed skin is Lucas Paw Paw Ointment. You can get this at most supermarkets and chemists. Hope this helps. PS The reason you don't use microwave for baby's bottle apart from hot spots and uneven temperature distribution is it can destroy the good enzymes in breast milk (if you are expressing for later use).|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Thats crazy. I could not imagine not using baby wipes! We used baby wipes and Ryan was just fine/ He has super sensitive skin. He actually was allergic to the Johnsons products!|`|MeYILJeSaa	Oh, don't worry about it, just use unscented wipes. It will be fine.
e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	You mean pants with chains as in tripp pants or chains that guys use to keep their wallet attached to their pants? LOL.<br>  <br>  I think both are fine.  I personally own an inch thick wallet chain myself.  <br>  <br>  My view is indifferent.  A little 00's, but it's all good.|`|kDvKc3npaa	They're called trip pants.<br>  <br>  I like them.<br>  Don't hate, don't love, just like.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	TACKY<br>  (hate them)|`|kRaVa0Wraa	HATE THEM.<br>  ugly as butt D:|`|ARLr7k0Faa	On guys they can be cute.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Honeslty, Depends on how hot the guy is.|`|9xocw9jpaa	It depends. Some look kindda cute, but there are some that just look lame! Especially the huge and long chains. It just looks tacky.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Hate them.<br>  There so ugly.|`|pSkPC3sbaa	Only on guys they look cute it depends on how the guy looks though|`|455LuvCzaa	i don't like them but on a few guys they look cute.. & just one day occasion...|`|17acJiqKaa	Hate them!|`|dbf8Afhoaa	Hate them!|`|sFOncR1Qaa	Certain guys can pull it off, but other then that... HATE THEM!|`|kVZoeh9paa	i dont hate them, dont love em. i have no opinion on the matter|`|JAZWe8A6aa	Well schools obvious don't like them, because they can signify gang related activity, but I think that they're fun up to a certain extent. I do agree with schools not allowing it though, because people these days are just really violent and things... but whatever.<br>  <br>  So I don't hate chains, but I don't love them either; I tolerate them. If someone wears chains, I don't automatically not like their outfit because of it. Some people do overdo chains though, like they wear like five chains. That doesn't interest me too much.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, I think that chains are fine up to a certain extent.|`|DmBarZr9aa	Hi, ThexScene,<br>  <br>  I personally do not like pants with chains on them, I find them to be quite the turn-off.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Kate|`|ND6mkEDqaa	so uuuuuggggggglllllyyyyyyyy!!|`|YGz6ojgraa	HATE 'EM|`|rbsjPvgkaa	hate them!  very bad... they look like some kind of medieval torture device
cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	Okay, I think you're taking the advice a little too broadly.<br>  <br>  THe rule of thumb is that you can't eat anything that is UNpasteurised (heat treated).<br>  <br>  So that rules out SOME soft, blue-veined cheeses like brie, camembert, stilton. BUT if you buy these cheeses in the supermarket, they will more than likely be pasteurised.<br>  <br>  The main rule about egg is not eat it raw (so, for example, raw eggs are used to make chocolate mousse). Again, more store-bought mousses are pasteurised, so are okay.<br>  <br>  Milk is absolutely fine to have in any way, shape or form. No restrictions.<br>  <br>  Meat needs to be cooked through completely, but of course you can eat it. <br>  <br>  Just make sure you check the labels for everything to make sure it's pasteurised, and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend checking out a reputable website like keelymom, babycentre, or even nhsdirect for your info in the future.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	you can eat cheese and egg and milk or what ever you want...you are not supposed to eat SOFT cheeses..normal cheese is fine...you can eat egg at anytime just not running egg it has to be hard, you are absolutely allowed to eat cake..you can eat any meat you wish just not deli meats such as shaved ham or anything found in the deli..because it just sits there and contain listeria (very uncommon but very harmful to unborn baby)..you can drink milk but not milk that has been opened for at least 2 days!! or fish that is high in mercury..but everyone says eat what you crave so you can eat everything..|`|eV7rtxmuaa	No you shouldnt eat raw egg. You can eat eggs and meat but they just have to be well cooked. And you can consume milk... anything from the shops is fine... Just not straight from the cow.|`|NOz2FRlraa	You can eat cheese, egg, milk and meat. However, there are certain types of these foods that you should avoid.<br>  <br>  Don't eat soft cheeses and those with a moldy rind/veins in them. Eating normal cheddar cheese (or even mozzarella if you're a pizza a fan) is perfectly fine. <br>  <br>  You should avoid raw eggs...so avoid home made mayonnaise (shop bought stuff is fine because it will be made with pasteurised egg yolk). You can eat cakes (they have been cooked so the egg is no longer raw), hard-boiled eggs etc.<br>  <br>  You can eat milk. Milk is pasteurised to make it safe to drink. However, avoid home made ice cream (again, store bought is fine) or soft whip ice cream (like the stuff ice cream vans sell).<br>  <br>  Meat is fine also as long as it's cooked well...so avoid rare steaks. Ready cooked meats (like the deli counter at the supermarket) should also be avoided unless you re-heat them first.|`|LMc23g9Maa	Gee, the list of forbidden foods seems to be getting longer every day.  I never heard of milk and meat!  I pity the women of 2020, they will probably have to survive on water and a few sterile biscuits!  My sister lives overseas and she can basically eat anything she wants.  She has two beautiful and healthy boys.|`|AA11349925	You can eat hard cheeses, you can eat eggs that have been cooked through, you can drink milk that is pasteurized most brands of fresh milk are pasteurized. It's all there in the article you haven't read it properly.<br>  <br>  You CAN eat cake the eggs in cakes are COOKED in the mixture....!!|`|86PuYgDJaa	You can eat cheese but not soft cheese like brie or cheese with veins in. You can eat eggs but only if they're well cooked - cakes are fine because the egg has been cooked. Steer clear of home made mayonaise and cheese cake though because the eggs aren't pasturised - you should be OK to have shop bought mayo just check the label that it is pasturised eggs used to make it. You can eat meat but again as long as it is well cooked. Don;t eat any shell fish like prawns because they tend to be undercooked when served because they go rubbery when they're cooked well. You can drink milk too - you need milk to make sure you get enough calcium - again I think it's fine as long as it's pasturised<br>  I'd speak to your midwife and they will give you a booklet on healthy eating and diet during pregnancy that should explain everything for you <br>  Good luck x|`|aWzFmmWzaa	You can eat cheese, eggs and milk.  You are only not allowed to eat soft cheeses like Camembert and blue veined cheese normal hard cheese is fine like chedder.  Eggs are fine as long as the are cooked properly and the yolk is hard and its only unpasturised milk that is not safe all supermarket bought milk is pasturised so its fine.  It does say that in the article you may want to read it again.|`|ELIKp5tDaa	erm, ive only just recently heard of the not eating deli meat during pregnancy thing...<br>  as for everything else, its fine, lol just, like everyone else said, dont eat them raw... *who would want to?*<br>  im the oldest of like 30+ grandkids and not one of my aunts or cousins has said that their doc told them not to eat cheeses or meats...<br>   as for the milk straight from the cow, honestly its probably the safest time to GET milk in my opinion<br>  our milk goes from the sanitized cow teats, through sanitized pipes, into sanitized bulk holding tank and some goes into our tummies.... hasnt been homogenized nor pasturized, its just been chilled..<br>  women drank milk that didnt even GET refrigerated for hundreds of years... -.-<br>  lotta women in my family drank unpasturized milk throughout pregnancy *2 or more pregnancies each* and all had healthy babies|`|wK4kqhHkaa	You can eat cheese egg and milk.  You can't eat SOFT cheeses like brie and camenbert. You can't eat RAW eggs- cooked is fine and you definitely can drink milk maybe not the unpasturised type.  Iv never heard of a pregnant woman not being able to drink milk.  I don't think that list is correct.  You didn't read the article properly- you need to read past the heading.|`|ZR7Fgerlaa	i read that article, and you can pretty much eat whatever you want, as long as it's cooked/prepared right.  even things like tuna that you're supposed to avoid can be consumed in small quantities.  i ate just about whatever and both of our babies are fine.  raw eggs aren't advisable ever, though, so steer clear of that.  and also stay away from raspberry leaf tea as it can cause contractions.  actually, anything herbal (unless your doctor ok's it) or caffienated should be avoided.|`|azE51WGRaa	If you want your baby to be healthy, do it the old fashioned way. Eat fresh vegitables amd friuts, drink at least 130oz of water (2 times of what you normally would drink.) Watch how how you cook you meats (why fry when you can bake). And don't freakout if you go have a bigmac once in awhile. Unless you're on a special diet, eat whatever you feel like eating. I see no problem with you eating the same things now as you did before. Don't psyche yourself out over holloywood glamerous "Should we puke nor or later" magazines...you'll be fine|`|5wn8Lksdaa	You only can't eat unpastuerized cheese or raw eggs. And if you eat deli meat you're supposed to microwave it first. Of course these are only suggestions. Eating one of these things is only going to hurt you if its contaminated.|`|56YFjZxAaa	i know you shouldnt eat raw egg|`|ctJsLe2Taa	i think you can eat milk it would make sense don't you think baby needing calcium im pretty sure you can't eat any raw stuff like fish so stay away from sushi but i think a minimum of eggs that are cooked like in cakes can't hurt don't risk it with sunny side up tough i would check with your doctor and make him right a list of stuff you should or shouldn't eat you can also go to your baby book store they have many books on what you ca or can't and what is healthy..you can eat lots of vegetables the superfood are oatmeal, tomatoe, carrots, garlic, oranges, soy, fish, spinach, yogurt and broccoli just a tip my mom ate banana and cheese while she was pregnant so maybe you can even eat cheese|`|9LVxRAcraa	no no no no its all right you can eat cheese  but just processed normal cheese not gourmet cheeses that are cultured you can drink milk just be very certain it is not been left out of the fridge or off as it may contain listeria fresh milk is very important for you teeth and bones and your babies bones definitely 1000g of calcium a day should do it, eat meat or you and your baby will not grow properly make sure it is fully cooked through do not eat raw meat or raw shellfish just properly cooked don't eat raw eggs or 'runny' hot eggs must be fully cooked these don't eats in pregnancy is more about being careful of food poisoning just don't eat anything that you normally wouldn't that could give you food poisoning or are bacteria 'risky foods' such as gourmet cheeses raw meat unprocessed milk fresh from the cow or goat  raw not fully cooked egg or improperly cooked take away food|`|nMuObehIaa	You can eat eggs, just not raw or undercooked eggs, and you can have cheeses like cheddar and jack, and such, not cheeses with mold, like blue or stilton, you can eat fully cooked meats, just no steak tartar or rare cooked meats, And you can eat these things in small portions if you really want them, it's just there is a chance of bacterial influence.
uj1A73ZGaa	Well I have a two year old and twins that are almost 4months old. Its hard to keep everyone happy. Have you tried the swing or bouncy seat? My twins love their swings. <br>  My twins are pretty happy most of the time its my two year old that is the one that wants to be held or needs something every time I try to feed or change the babies.|`|QqFPNti4aa	Unfortunatley your baby know the difference about where you are by the sounds and the smells.  He also know when you are most stressed.  <br>  <br>  Any mother will tell you she can not please everyone 24 7.  And with twins on your hands that will never work all the time.  You are just going to have to let the baby cry as mean as that sounds.  He will not harm himself by crying while you change a diaper.  Also maybe the twins can help a little bit.  And inlist some help from anywhere you can.  I wish you all the luck in your struggle for peace!|`|OBzIzElFaa	It is hard to keep EVERYONE in your household happy, all at once. When you start to feel really frustrated, stop and take a few long deep breaths. In my opinion, carrying your baby around in the Moby, may be convenient,but not always the best option. Putting him in a "bouncy chair" or a swing can help. They will keep his attention for a while. Laying him on a blanket in the middle of the floor, w/ t.v. or music is good too. Even though it can be very annoying, it is O.K. for babies to cry. It is good for exercising their lungs. As for keeping everyone happy, you just need to try different things- routines. You will find something that works for you.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	unfortunately, you have to do what you have to do; my ped told me that putting them down for a few mins to do something you need to do won't hurt anything, even if they are outright crying (obviously not 30 mins); have you tried a swing, bouncy seat, something along that line? my dd would be content in those for short periods as a nb...|`|u94HOVz7aa	my son is like that with my wraps.  i have some slings  too and at home he likes being in them more.
WH7nCuc7aa	Well yeah you are right, but these people are probably too poor to pay that kind of amount (not in a mean way)  I'd rather just help someone out, then do what kind of money i'm thinkin' I should get, and besides, they can pay however much they need to. It's either all or nothing.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	That is completely fair.  I get paid through the state to babysit for my friend and I only get paid 10 a day and it doesn't matter how long I have them for.  20 is more then fair.  That is what I pay my babysitter.|`|lSl2Arlpaa	there isnt a set fee for babysitting its up to the perants to decide what theyre willing to give and the babysitter to decide whether to take it or not.|`|NigoVXX1aa	You are getting paid to have fun with the kids so why not take the offer.At least you are getting paid for your time.Remember you are just 14,be thankful that you can earn.Something better than nothing.|`|gtFcBdBRaa	No, that's not fair. You should tell them that you charge by the hour, not by the child. I know that the people I babysit for always like to know what I usually charge. They will  most likely respect the fact that you are telling them. I usually get paid $8 for 2 kids, but you charge what you're comfortable with.|`|7B1rZTtpaa	its not really that unfair but if you feel like you want more just tell the parents dont be rude or unkind just let them know that you need more if you are going to babysit three toddlers.   i personally babysit all the time, you just gotta get on the right side of parents.  personality is key.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i would ask for more money|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	No, it isn't fair. You should charge by hour instead of kid, especially considering that they are so many and so young. Ask them (politely) if they could pay by hour instead, or pay 9 dollars per child.

hSTNMnFPaa	Calista Isis is stunning! I simply adore Calista and Isis is a lovely mythological name to go with it. Wonderful! But if you're not sure about Isis, what about Calista Iris? It has a similar sound, and Iris was the goddess of the rainbow, so the full name would mean "most beautiful rainbow" (Calista means "most beautiful").<br>  <br>  Jeremiah Everett I'm not a fan of though.

42vC5ztpaa	You normally ovulate 8 days after the end of your period, so I start testing around day 5 after my period and normally have a result by the 6th or 7th day.

LoP2CRE2aa	I really don't know, but I would assume a day or two.
ioZeveazaa	I agree with what your mom said. You should be ready to spend two decades of your life to someone who is going to need you..in my opinion before you even jump into bed with someone because pregnancy is always a chance no matter what. I think a girl should be financially capable of supporting a baby also. It is sad because now a days alot of teen girls are getting pregnant while still in or just out of high school and have no job that can help them support in the long run. They then have to sacrifice themselves going to school and supporting a baby at the same time. <br>  <br>  "Kids are hard work, and those beautiful babies grow up to be teenagers, and that, hon, is for sure no fun... not for the parents or anyone else who has to deal with them. Look at all the questions under Adolescence in this section. Crazy, and very sad... ":I hate my mom... how can I stand to be in this house another 5 years????" and similar questions..."<br>  <br>  Kids are hard work but that is why iit is best to be financially stable because as a mother you are going to have alot to do caring for your baby. The stress of finding a job would only hinder time with your child. However children are blessings and age of those children have no relevance to how people "accept" them. Even when they become teens they are still pleasant. Your child is YOUR child and true love is unconditional and that is the kind of love a mother has for her child. The last part of the paragraph with the teen speaking is sad. That child must not grow up in a good home or have issues that make him feel that way. I have four siblings that are all teenagers. They have their sulky moments but to say something like what that person said would be just traumatic to me if my daughter said something like that. A good mother only wants to the best for her children and for them to always be safe and healthy so if that makes them awful for not allowing them out after a certain time, restricting calls, etc then the child just doesn't understand.<br>  <br>  This is my opinion though. Good luck!!|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I feel very badly for people who have that outlook. She seems a bit extreme. Its sad that she has/had such a poor experience with her children and thinks that little of being a mom. <br>  <br>  I'm 26 and I really adore my mom. We had a year or two that were rough in highschool but really she is my best friend and I'm okay saying that. I've learned so much from her and really take her opinions seriously. I may disagree with her from time to time but I still go to her for advice about things. I'd hope she didn't feel trapped by me and thought raising me was fun (even in my teen years). I really think she does feel that way.<br>  <br>  I don't plan on every having a child biologically but am going to adopt through foster care in the next 3 years. She would think I'm crazy but I plan on adopting teenagers!! And as a single mom with no significant other in the picture. I must really like inflicting pain on myself...at least according to her. <br>  <br>  I do agree with being financially and emotionally stable but the rest of it I think is just a sad woman who either didn't want to be a mom originally or figured that out too late. Personally I think you take the good parts of being a mom with the bad parts. Otherwise it would be too easy and boring.|`|4Uuehq2Faa	I think she was trying to pass her experience on, when i read it, i was a bit offended too, about the hate part, but it does happen, many children dont like their parents, go against what they say & sneak around, it sucks, but its true, but your more likely to get children who will respect and love you than the latter, dont stress, her experience doesnt mean everyone elses children will be the same, i wonder why her children hate her?... maybe because she exaggerates and wants her child to have her experiences since shes telling all us it will be the same? *shrugs*|`|VPVg792eaa	this person was has not put me off having children i have 2 and they are both very good children i do not get along with my mum but for reasons half of you would not believe not a discussion but i think this women has either had some real bad experiences and maybe you think she would have been better keeping them to herself as she has had a huge impact on others or she may just be trying to frighten the silly immature girls that come on here into not having children so young i don't know but i think it would be fair to say it is no ones place to judge for whatever her reasons maybe whoever's question she was answering if they have there head screwed on they will make there own decisions sorry im open minded and have also answered questions in different directions so that people look outside the box sometimes it can be very helpful|`|f8240cd0e6b54863a050b702a65c786caa	The ravings of one person will not affect others,nothing would have stopped us from having our children.<br>  We were a one income family until the last one went to school, then my wife got a degree and started work. Sure the kids may act like they don't like you, and want to get out on their own. That's life.<br>  It's like that other question about marriage, listing the bad things, but none of the good.<br>  I think the thing is to direct your life and embrace what you have, there are plenty of people who have less.|`|l9lrT7bfaa	I think she is trying to tell it like it is. You do need to have your own life sorted, academically, financially and have a solid relationship to give the child the best chances.<br>  <br>  Having kids can be tough and that is the truth, if that is balanced by a loving close realtionship with the parents then parenthood can be a great experience.<br>  <br>  Being a parent is different for everyone, nobodys experience is any less valid than anyone elses.|`|AA11455733	First off Congratulations on the baby I hope all is going well.<br>  As to your question, it is not easy to raise children at times you may ask yourself if you are doing a good job, or what did I do wrong?<br>  Don't worry we have all asked ourselves this over the years. <br>  <br>  At times my teenagers have driven me nuts with their attitude, I remind them I am not one of their friends from school and they are not allowed to talk to me that way. I am always the mother first and friend second they understand that and respect it.<br>  <br>  I have a wonderful relationship with all three of my daughters, they come to me for many things and tell me stuff I would rather not hear but glad they can share. I am friends with my two oldest ages 20 and 18 since mothering them is not needed as much these days.<br>  <br>  One of the ways I have been able to do this is keep an open ear and a closed mouth unless asked for advise, I have also kept the secrets they have asked me to keep. I have also made sure to spend time alone with each of them as they grew up.|`|QKh7voVKaa	I have a beautiful tumultuous 14yo. to be completely honest she has been known to say I hate you to me but she could never live a day without me she loves me very deeply but if you care and love someone you try to understand them, teenage girls especially receive massive hormones and complicated new brain chemistry forming new neurological pathways, mentally their brains go into overload, some are more affected than others but the most important thing is your beautiful sweet loving innocent vulnerable little girl that you have watched learnt to walk and ride a bike, who cries on your shoulder when they're hurt, who brings you home sloshes of paint and tells you it's you mummy, cos your the best mummy ever, and leaves you little 'i love you' notes in all the books you read! is in there trying to understand and deal with complex emotions and conflicting compulsions. a good parent will be patient and wait for the storm to pass, which it always does, and then help them to recover from what they have said and teach them the right way to employ their emotions. Not that i can talk, I only became this insightful after reading 'princess bitchface syndrome', a great book on the physiological changes in teenagers and their directly related symptoms. you can make anything sound bad, don't listen to those you come across in life that only see the glass half empty. their moronic iterate comes from ignorance, always. you will love your teenager no matter what silly thing they do, try to have a good equally respectful relationship with your child before they reach the 'tyrannical' age and you will be fine.|`|X7IX3FE8aa	There's no denying that most teenage kids are hard work, but I think this lady's gone a bit overboard.  Sure, I went a bit off the rails when I was a teen but I have never hated my parents and am very close with them, like you are. Don't be scared to have your baby - it seems to me that this woman (if she has kids) wasn't quite sure how to raise them properly and has created little terrors =/ And if she doesn't have kids, then she's just a miserable woman lol<br>  <br>  Good luck with your baby x|`|Xa9wiUnXaa	Wow this persons kids hate her. some people have a hard time with kids but thats the joy in it. You remember what its like to be that age and how you were and when your kid is feeling the worst you should be able to relate on some sort of a level because guess what, you were a kid too. and when they are all grown up and have achieved goals you can look back and say I helped them.|`|x1qKGmzSaa	well it depends on the kid.. my mom had 3 girls. I am VERY close with my parents, and actually a pretty good person, im 19. my sister who is 17, is also pretty close with my parents, but shes a little wild, gets into trouble for sneaking out and stuff... and then theres my youngest sister who is 12, and she is completely opposite of my sister and I, she hates our parents, completely disobeys them, yells at them, etc. but children are a joy. I think it's just with the age.. just some kids hate their parents at that age.. but as long as ur a good mother, they'll become closer with you when theyre older.

I have will starting my fourth round of clomid this month.  My doctor says if it doesn't work then we will try something different next month.  At first I figured that it would just happen but after 3 years of trying to conceive naturally I thought maybe something was wrong so I went to the doctor.  The doctor told me that I do not ovulate therefore making it impossible to get pregnant.   After 3 failed cycles of clomid I am starting to lose hope.|`|13hFRGN9aa	6 months and I have been to a fertility doctor, i have taken clomid and injection for 6 months now. I have had 2 artificial inseminations. No luck. I decided yesterday that I will not be going back to the fertility doctor again. i just think that spending all this money to have a baby is not right, when there are other people out there getting pg for free. we are going to continue trying on our own and you are right if God want us to have one he will give us one.|`|eemmWU0Haa	when I was 21 I was told I had to get operated cos I had endometriosis so I had the operation and ever since then almost 5 years now Ive been trying to get pregnant in February I found out that I have endometriosis once again but Ive changed dr's. and I told her Im fed up and would really like to get pregnant so she gave me clomid 50 mg but I so hope it works she said once I do get pregnant then we can think about treating my endometrisosis once again.. in all Ive had 7 miscarriages= 2 in the last year in September and another one in December with my fiance.|`|e15f7ea99e618de3d7240c424a2e8a97aa	My husband and I have been trying for a little over a year, I just finished my first round of clomid, so I hope that it worked! <br>  <br>  I understand your feelings about leaving it up to God, I was conflicted about taking the clomid.

Its very frustrating too since everyone around me are popping out babies left and right. I just started trying the OPK to see exactly when I ovulate since I always assumed it was around day 14 (I'm regular between 27-28 days).

NBOBMQwdaa	Group 2! All nice names, however in group one you spelled "Mallery" wrong (It's supposed to be Mallory.) And in group 3 you spelled Holyss wrong (Should be Hollis). <br>  <br>  As a general note to people who have a child to name, don't try to make it "unique" by spelling your child's name wrong.

W16vRFTNaa	this is completely normal you hopefully will start dilating soon. You are just one of those lucky women who have long labors and hopefully most of it will be at home where you can be more comfortable.|`|nsbsbPpAaa	I JUST HAD A BOY HE IS A WEEK OLD..THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND THE NEXT MORNING I WENT IN AND I WAS A 7 GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND GET CHECKED.... LET ME KNOW|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Get ready Mom. Looks like baby is just making sure, you know they are coming before they start coming|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Sounds like it.  Start walking!  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|lkhCeAdJaa	It surprises me that you had a lot of blood but you aren't dilated any.  usually the blood is a sign of rapid dilation.  Your doc told you that you're not dilated?|`|sxecXFgraa	Start walking.  I had back pain with my first.  She wasn't turned right.  Instead of being face down like most babies are when they're born, she was face up so her spine was against my spine.  I would have rather have straight contractions than that pain.  The doctor was able to get her to turn to relieve the pain for me.
BiMeb75Gaa	I love the name Christopher so it's really hard to pick but I'd say Christopher Carter.|`|GqsZigbXaa	christopher jay|`|GFzDwIk6aa	I like Christopher Jackson and Christopher Carter.<br>  Christopher Jackson flows the best.
sWXrnErnaa	Yes you can fall pregnant on birth control (though you dont mention what form you are using)....the chances are a lot slimmer but it is possible. <br>  <br>  I would suggest if you are concerned that you contact your local family planning clinic or chemist and inquire about the morning after pill. I think it usually costs about $15 (thats here in australia anyway)<br>  <br>  No taking several birth control pills at one time does not have the same effect.....they work on different parts of the hormonal system......<br>  <br>  If I was you Id try not to stress and take the added precaution, just for piece of mind.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	It's very unlikely.  I was on birth control only (no condoms) for 7 years of my relationship and never got pregnant.  As soon as I went off birth control it took only 2 months to get pregnant.  The morning after pill couldn't hurt though I guess, but I wouldn't bother unless you missed a pill within the past week.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	If you took your birth control every day and didn't skip or miss pills you are completely safe.<br>  <br>  That what it was designed for... to be 99.9 percent effective to protect from pregnancy while you have unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  Do not take double doses of your regular birth control. You don't need to. You are protected as long as you took them on time every day.|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	yes you can, but its a 0.01% chance. highly unlikely. you should be fine, don't stress about and stay on your bc.|`|Bc4ZDVk4aa	no you will be fine like you said you were taking it properly..dont worry about it stressing wont help..also dont take a few bc pills as plan b its not good for you..relax|`|56YFjZxAaa	Anything is possible, as long as you have took the pill at the same time everyday you should be fine. If you have missed a day or took them at random times then its okay to worry.|`|MCCtEf3Laa	Yes you can, get Plan B just to be covered.|`|VxySsVbwaa	If you are on the pill, you are probably safe. I've heard of it happening, but not often.|`|IB9NmwZ1aa	yeah if it doesnt work <br>  if your body rejects the pills 2|`|Foi6PFWQaa	Yes, you can get pregnant with birth control. Go and get Plan B.
RsFxgN4Gaa	DON'T SIGN THAT NOTE!<br>  <br>  She skipped school and now she needs to face the consequences of that. Making her face them doesn't make you too strict, it makes you a good parent!<br>  <br>  I feel sorry for the other girls.. their parents don't care enough to make them deal with what they did. Covering their butts doesn't teach them a thing.<br>  <br>  Be the example here of how a parent who loves their child reacts. Let her do the detention and make sure to punish her at home as well.|`|gYfvCkRPaa	Virginie,<br>  <br>  Two things to consider here:<br>  1. It's not about the other girls and their parents, it's about you and your daughter.<br>  2. What happens to your integrity in your daughter's eyes if you sign the note? YOU have just taught your daughter that it is OK to do what she did (rewarding negative behavior); OK to undermine the school; and OK to lie. Is that what you really want to do?<br>  <br>  Go with your initial reaction.<br>  <br>  "Ranger"|`|doeg7JSaaa	If you lie in support of your daughter you are teaching her a very bad lesson. <br>  We all tell white lies on occasions but you can't be seen to support her dishonesty or it will come back to haunt you when you next try to discipline her for something else.<br>  If your daughter were to write a letter of apology to the school it may do her some good given that the school already know the other girls are lying.|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	Well. Thats a hard one. <br>  It's really your choice.<br>  I would sign it the first time, warning her if it EVER happened again that you would NOT excuse her from the detention.<br>  Then, Theres another option.<br>  Don't sign it, and let her learn a lesson. She'll never do it again.<br>  So here it comes b ack to you. You can take a pick<br>  Good luck!|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	I wouldn't sign it. <br>  <br>  She skipped and she knew she'd get in trouble for it; she needs to accept the consequences of her actions. Maybe next time she'll ask you for a day free in the future.  (As long as she's getting all A's in her schoolwork, etc).|`|AA11968687	The punishment was a bit harsh but I agree with your decision, you are teaching your daughter to take responsibility for her actions and next time she'd think twice about skipping school.|`|5FgAyh86aa	Sign it<br>  But sit and have a long talk with her, and tell her to never do it again etc etc.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Nope don't sign it. The school will still suspect they were wagging anyway, and you will all end up with a reputation.<br>  It is unfair that your daughter will be in detention while her friends are not in trouble-but she DID break the rules, and that means she should suffer the consequences. Hopefully she will realise  it was a pretty silly thing to do, and learn from her mistake. I do think 2 weeks is a little excessive though-I think one week would be enough.<br>  Maybe you should let the school know what's going on? If your daughter doesn't have a note they will know the other parents are lying anyway. <br>  If you stand your ground I think it will work out the best for everyone. Just my opinion-you know what's best for you and your family.<br>  Good luck|`|O1Xm6X7Iaa	I wouldn't sign the note. It might sound unfair that she will be punished by the school while the other girls won't be but at least it will teach her a lesson and hopefully she can learn from it. If you back up the school then it also sends a clear message to the other girls' parents and maybe they will think twice about excusing their daughter's misbehaviour.<br>  <br>  Not a nice situation but good luck in your decision.|`|GwWDnvB8aa	No, you aren't being overly strict. Your daughter committed an infraction of school rules, so the school has the responsibility to discipline her. The other girls will just continue to break school rules, since their parents are teaching them that it's okay to do this. If your daughter has to serve detention, she will learn a lesson and not do this again. I'd frankly be glad to keep her away from those other girls, and having her serve detention without them is one way to do this.|`|OEu0wy2waa	I'd definitely sign the note. In the grand scheme of things it won't make a jot of difference to her life. Be thankful your teenage daughter has just skipped school, things could be so much worse. She's growing up, she'll do some wrong things and she'll make mistakes. Support her and she'll thank you for it. Just sign it and discipline her in your own reasonable way.|`|6nn7f41Faa	I wouldn't sign it. She needs to learn some consequences of her actions, and they need to be associated with the wrongdoing. So, if she skips school, then she needs to stay at school longer for two weeks and catch up on what she missed, even if she does it alone. If she ends up being the only child who learns something from this behaviour, then it is all worth it in the end...trust me. I've been there. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way.|`|tGgLhOIGaa	Sign the note for the poor girl!<br>  give her a seperate punishment at home as you suggested as it would be unfair for her to be punished at school alone. Anyway two weeks of afterschool detention is wayy to big of a punishment for skipping school for an afternoon!<br>  good luck|`|ysSWwSa7aa	Sign the note and let her be excused. One day doesn't hurt and 2 weeks is a bit harsh.<br>  <br>  If she was doing the detention with her friends it would be a different story and she might  as well do the detentions.|`|n4zSSH9jaa	l can see your dilema, but she shouldnt be punished alone, but as you say be punished at home instead, this doesnt make you an over strick parent, just a caring one as your trying to do the right thing.|`|WDEWAR8Faa	no she made the decission to skip school without telling you so she should face the concequences and if you did let her off then she might take advantage of you in the future|`|DnNkCF6Taa	It doesn't matter what her friend's parents are doing, your concern is not with their kids but how to raise your daughter.  I think you should not sign the note, just because she has to face the music alone.  Because if you do sign the note it means that she will get out of it at the school, which yes detention would affect her social life some, but it is what was earned.  I think if you let her out of it, it will teach her that if she can find a good enough excuse for something she may get out of trouble at school, and then expect you to be there the next time it comes up. <br>  <br>  In other words, she id the crime, the only responsible thing to do, is to let her face the punishment of the school.  To help her learn to take responsibility for her actions.|`|uP08b6K4aa	It's a tough one, but given that the other parents are providing an excuse for their absence, then I'd be inclined to feel the same as you in that it would be unfair for her to serve a punishment set out by the school if the other friends are getting away with it.  I know it's not politically correct to do such a thing, but it's not as if she's skipped school to go and steal from shops, or take drugs.<br>  <br>  The fact that you're prepared to have her serve her with punishment as set out by you, is enough.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|AA10494763	It is not fair but that is the other parents fault.  I know you will hate picking her up late but she needs to know there are consequences at home and school.  That is what life is about|`|AA11784984	I wouldn't sign it. She knew it was wrong and so do you. It the other girls parents that are in the wrong now and not teaching their daughters right from wrong. Yes it will seem unfair to your daughter but maybe she will learn from it and not do it again. As for the other girls they will most likely do it again because the didn't get in trouble this time.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	It's got nothng to do with the other children - it's your daughter and she did wrong.  Stick to your principles.  Yes, I know the others got away with it, but those girls will feel bad and so will their parents.  At least you are teaching your daughter honesty.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	no let her learn the hard way ,back the school up. you will be teaching her the difference from right or wrong ,when her mates want to do it again knowing there parents will back them up, your daughter will know she wont get away with it|`|5ZbFdcwdaa	wtf!? I just answered a question of yours where you said it was you at school! who are you?

n6XYYyoLaa	she is 3.5 mos old and you have been feeding her all this already? why would you bother asking anything at this point as you obviously aren't that concerned with guidelines or her developmental stage...i suggest you lay off all the 'new' foods, do some reading on infant nutrition, take some parenting classes and talk to your ped about all this before you keep on blundering your way through....no one gets a book of instructions with a baby, but as an adult charged with their care, it is our responsibility to educate ourselves on what is safe and practical for them as they grow...when you talk to your doc, be sure and tell them what you already have done...sheesh|`|01Mu3wUeaa	If it comes in flavors, it's not unsweetened.<br>  <br>  Why is your baby consuming cereal and food? her digestive track is still immature.You should wait to at LEAST 4 months unless the doctor directs you otherwise.<br>  <br>  Anyways, look on the back and see how healthy it is before you put anything in your kids' body.|`|VXhOLgDEaa	I'm not sure what that is...but if it's fruit I'm sure it's okay. My thing is...as long as the baby is taking formula and food perfectly fine..is eating healthy with veggies....then once in awhile snacks are okay. I don't give my 10 mth old daughter cookies and brownies...but I do give her rice crackers...little puffs...ice cream because it has milk in it...and her strawberry cereal bars....etc.etc....of course she loves them because they're yummy...but she still eats her solids and table foods...all her veggies..and she's perfectly healthy!....Now if she were to stop eating her veggies and just want sweets then there would be a problem...but other then that it's fine.|`|sYsfI856aa	I would wait until you've introduced more foods. She could have an allergic reaction to one of them, and you wouldn't have any idea which one. It's safe to use straight juices if you feel you must, but a 3.5 month old really ONLY need your breastmilk or formula.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I can't tell you what you should or shouldn't so, but I'm sure something like that is filled with sugar and preservatives, if that matters to you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It can't be "unsweetened" if it is fruit flavored. The fruit (or fruit flavoring) is a sweetener.|`|AA12243380	I wouldn't do it.  She is already too young for designated baby food, I wouldn't give her food not designed for babies.  She could aspirate it and have a real problem.  It's too thick for such a tiny tiny baby.|`|USrhxMW9aa	I wouldn't think you should be giving that to her.  Like the other person said, 4 months is the earliest you should try solids with a baby plus I've heard that berries shouldn't be given right away because they're likely to cause allergic reactions.  Since this would be giving her multiple fruits at a time you wouldn't even know which one may be causing a problem.  You should try each fruit individually, and wait a few days before trying a new one so that you could figure out which one caused a reaction.  Also, you said your 3 1/2 month old is eighteen pounds, I don't think she needs any extra sugar in her diet.  My son is 6 3/4 months old and doesn't even weigh that much and he eats two meals of solids a day.|`|tEEB5339aa	I would say no. They have special kinds of juices that are made especially for infants, if you really want to give her juice- go with one of those. When you are introducing your baby to new foods, it is important to try them 1 at a time so you can monitor your baby's reactions and look out for any potential side effects or allergies. So, the fact that it as multiple kids of fruits in the juice that she has not been introduced to yet, I would say it is not a good idea. Also, Mott's could contain artificial flavors, colors, and maybe even sweeteners. I do not know this to be a fact, as I am not familiar with that particular brand. But, I do know others similar have artificial stuff in it such as high fructose corn syrup. Look at the label and see if it is actually 100% juice. If you are still not sure, call your doctor. I hope it all works out :)|`|TJusfEnlaa	You shoudl not be feeding your baby at 3 and a half months. 4 months is the absolute youngest you should *try* solids - their tiny little stomachs cannot digest it. <br>  So yeah, the answer is NO.<br>  wait a few months.<br>  soon you will be able to feed her everything and that should please you yes?|`|gTOmztJxaa	What are Fruitsations?

1enIWBGnaa	It takes a few days for your milk to 'come in' so he's probably only getting a clear liquid (which is good for him).  If you aren't sure about your milk - pull away from the baby and check to see if there's any milk on your nipple or check to see if there's any milk in his mouth.  If there is, fine - if not, then you may have to use a pump and then go back to nursing again.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	I agree with chicken. The male avatar threw me off too. lol<br>  I breastfed all 3 of my children and believe me your baby will know when it has had enough. Breast feeding for the first time will make a new mother worry if the baby is getting enough. Trust me. He is. If he seems content and quiet then that will let you know he has had enough. He will not want to suckle anymore if he is full. As long as you know your milk is coming down rest assured he is getting enough.<br>  It usually takes a few days for the actual milk to come through right now he is getting colustrum.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	lots of poopy diapers along with lots of wet diapers is a sign they are eating. If you are BF I would reccomend getting a scale that reads ounces weight the baby before then after and you will know how much they are taking in. this is I feel a must for all bf moms because i did not know there was soemthing wrong till my son was looking thin and white. he was sucking but not getting what he needed. also that way you monitor their weigh gain so you know how they are doing and if they are getting what they need.|`|DiNZ0Joraa	I breastfed exclussively for the first five months... then I stopped because it was too hard working full time and all.... but I found that when your breasts are softer after feedings... he's getting it... if you hear him gluping...it's a soft sound... but my son did 'gulp'. they also do alot of fast sucks first... then a serious or longer sucks.... He was gulping during the longer sucks. <br>  <br>  Dont be afraid to call the lactation nurse at the hospital you delievered your child at! She was my best friend and alot of support during the first few weeks. If you can't seem to get ahold of someone let me know. I'll give you my doctors number.... they don't ask personal info... it's a first name basis..... GOOD LUCK!|`|qQv2cZ9zaa	When I had my daughter, they had me count how many diapers she went through the first two weeks or so. The first few days, they don't go through too many because they're just starting to eat and poop. Where you are, at 3 days, it's still going through your son's system and you might not have seen too much of it yet. But if he's wetting a few diapers a day and pooping every day, you're good. Within a few days, it should seem almost endless - at least 8 a day, and 12 is not unreasonable.|`|f49aab59bea9737e201eb6b2439035f2aa	my midwife said to me to give my nipple a bit of a squeeze so i know milk is coming out before latching the baby on. maybe try this? but like everyone else says, if there's dirty nappies i'd say its safe to assume he's getting some milk.|`|fToG0uSbaa	If he is having wet dirty diapers i suppose.|`|AkFag8tNaa	The male avatar threw me for minute......if you have let down and your child is having multiple wet/poopy diapers a day, he is getting milk.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	your milk probably hasn't even come in yet. you'll know when that happens! it will be quite painful.<br>  <br>  but when your baby gets full, he'll release himself from the breast. thats how you know he is getting enough to eat.|`|LUjCnYmoaa	my wife did the same thing with our son, we felt that he was getting enough milk and after noticing that his diapers were not wet we took him into the ER they hospitalized him for the night and got my wife a pump to use, so they could see if she was producing enough milk, turns our she was but our son having his dads weak jaw, and being tongue tied couldn't get a good suck on the nipple. <br>  My wife proceeded to pump for 8 months and has recently got him back over to the breast, using a nipple shield.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't get to worried unless|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	It is very common to worry about having too little milk. And in a sense all moms do from time to time. As your baby grows, he will require more food. <br>   <br>  My midwife's advice is to pick two days and feed your baby every second hour around the clock. This will help the milk supply to adjust to the baby's increased need. <br>  <br>  But the truth is, if your baby gains weight as he should, you have enough milk. Check with your child's doctor if you're the least worried!|`|hWe8vhKKaa	lot of wet and dirty nappies also breastfed babies can go on a weeks wiyhout doing a dirty nappy|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Is he having plenty of wet and dirty nappies?

x32vIjXHaa	How cute, I have my 20 week scan Wednesday at 1:45. I was told by my dr. to drink orange juice or apple juice 30 minutes before, and eat fruit like a banana, or he even suggested a candy bar. Also, I guess you aren't supposed to pee before hand, I was told that a full bladder will hurt, but will keep the baby moving, and pushed forward. Good luck to you, I can't wait either!!!!|`|SONLm2Ilaa	Drink powerade and a sugary breakfast like 30 min before! Baby will be movong around and you'll be sure to see the sex!|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I was advised orange juice and a piece of fruit, or something sweet for a burst of energy.. Couldnt face that, so i chose the orange juice and fruit option. However, still depends on how stubborn baby is and on whether he or she is willing to play ball. At mine, muffin 2 was having none of it, and refused point blank to budge but after a break, a few tears (I was extra hormonal) and deep breaths on my behalf, he did eventually relent and let us discover he was another boy..  <br>  The ultrasound tech usually looks at the pelvic shape anyway to determine the gender, not what's between the legs. But if bubs is in the wrong position and refusing to budge there's not much that can be done so usually they won't force the issue. They'll either leave it a few minutes and see if bubbas mood improves, or they'll abandon it completely and try another time.|`|etUFe6tJaa	My daughter had her legs crossed, but not enough to see that she is a girl!<br>  <br>  My sonographer was really good.  She didn't look for the obvious first, as sometimes this can be misguiding (ie. a well placed finger maybe interpreted as a penis - just like my friend who was pregnant last year, she ended up having a girl despite being told she was having a boy!).  Instead my sonographer looked at the baby's pelvic structure.  Obviously with girls the pelvic bone is made differently to a boy's.  So judging from that (and the fact she didn't see a peenie), she told me she was 99% sure it was a girl.<br>  <br>  Regarding tips to avoid legs crossed - you calm a baby by rocking it to sleep, so if you want the baby to be moving around, best to lay still yourself.  I dont know if this works but it seems whenever I tried to lie down for rest the baby kicks like crazy!!!!!|`|98WKYtfwaa	There is nothing you can do really, but if you drink a fizzy drink 20mins before your appointment such as lucozade then your baby is more likely to be moving around, which can get you a better view of the genitals.<br>  <br>  Edit* This isn't a guarentee, your baby might be facing your back, therefore if he/she is moving around, you might not get to see the genitals at all.|`|TrTfowAQaa	I found out when I was 16 weeks that i'm having a girl...i've also learned as she gets bigger and stronger she has a mind of her own...at the ultrasound they wanted to see her face but she had her arm in her mouth the whole time...so good luck and remember you baby has a mind of it's own...he or she as long as baby is healthy right? but I say girls cross their legs boys let it all hang out. also depends on the type of ultrasound mine was targeted & she didn't sit still at all...good luck I hope you get the baby of your dreams...|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	My ultrasound tech told me to drink orange juice & eat a banana on the way to the doctor before I get my 20 week scan!

8GO5VP1baa	First off, she's not too old to be in diapers! Every child is different, obviously some people don't realize that! My oldest wasn't potty trained until she was 3 and my third child was potty trained before she was 2. My 14 month old is working on potty training. If she is holding it until her diaper change, then she is probably ready to use the potty. You will probably just have to sit in the bathroom with her and let her know that she has to sit down.

y4TKXkbuaa	Just a quick tip: sometimes drinking  ice cold water makes Little Ones move :o) ( a tip from the mw 3 years ago) try not to worry too much, It all depends on how baby is laying aswell. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|p11HaDIWaa	i mean as long as ur hearing her heartbeat whats there to worry about??? once u get a little further along and ur baby gets a little bigger u will start feeling her move a whole lot more, like all throughout the day, and the kicks will get stronger and it'll be awesome:) good luck to u!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	you shouldn't worry about not feeling baby move every day until around 26 weeks. and if you're very active during the day, you may just miss the movements. so that could be what happened.<br>  <br>  but again, you shouldn't start feeling anything on a regular basis until week 26.<br>  <br>  i didn't feel the baby i'm carrying now until week 22. and then nothing consistent until week 25 or 26. so no worries for you. everything is normal!|`|a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	This is perfectly normal.  I started feeling my baby around 19 weeks and btw 19-25 weeks or so the baby's activity was very irregular.  Like you said some days he was very active and then other days I can't get him to budge even if I ate something sugary.  Then as the weeks go by you'll start to feel your baby more and more and it becomes pretty regular.  So don't worry that you're not constantly feeling it now.  As long as you do feel a little bit a day then she is doing fine.
O3EtP4vOaa	Ambien is some pretty bad stuff, I took it for awhile and I was fine (not pregnant though).  My friend took it and she would sleep walk and one time her husband caught her eatting a tub of butter w/ a spoon in the middle of the night.  She was sleeping the whole time and has no memory of it.  I do not think I would take it while being pregnant.  My doctor prescibed me phenegran to to help with the nausea while pregnant and that knocked me out and he also told me I could take benadryl.  I would maybe get a second opinion about taking it while pregnant.
2JKt3Nkqaa	white chocolate dipped in coke i did and it was surprisingly nice :)|`|7rKUmK0qaa	dried fish/dried squid dip into little soy sauce and vinegar (mixed together) and eat it w rice...yummy... i want it now hehe..<br>  Oh and strawberry w salt or kinda raw papaya w salt|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Cornflakes and viniger... eww I know!!|`|VKMBaz8daa	Hiya<br>  <br>  Mine has just been ice but that is it.|`|a6884b4116269b3d1288c76d227f8f70aa	Hey......<br>  <br>  I have no real odd ones to mention but ive had various ones on and off during my pregnancy.. Firstly it was really sour apples, like cooking apples sour.. Then it moved onto bean sprouts the crunchier the better and then i was looking for sweetcorn quite alot.... I did go off KFC thou to the point that thinking of it made me gag..... and now its jam sandwiches and a glass of milk.... thats strange for me given im dairy intolerant haha...<br>  <br>  Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy<br>  xx|`|wK4kqhHkaa	i didn't get any strange cravings.  The only thing i really craved  was orange juice i drank litres and litres of it.  A friend of mine said she use to crave dirt! She said when she smelt it she just wanted to get down and eat handfuls of it.  lol she didn't but|`|86PuYgDJaa	I haven't really had any really weird cravings - early on I wanted rich tea biscuits with marshmallows on top. Recently i've been having chicken and cheese paninis with BBQ sauce almost every day and always seem to want fizzy drinks which I never used to drink at all|`|zroeiVw2aa	i've just found out i'm pregnant... is this what i got to look forward to lol, can't wait to crave something, seems fun xx|`|56YFjZxAaa	popcorn and mustard.. i know strange.|`|ELIKp5tDaa	lol the other day i was craving a can of corned beef and hash|`|oZRfb0eAaa	ice cream and bacon sandwiches,|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Rib eye and philly steak sandwich everyday and oreos dipped into a glass or water.
G9UNW0NYaa	Probably not.  He is why you have anemia.  If he was anemic, he would not be growing as well, something your doctor would check for.  Most women are anemic during pregnancy, It's very common.  Fetal anemia is very uncommon.  I have a very high blood count normally, but near the end of my pregnancies, I'm always anemic.
6AvVVzsnaa	Any other ways besides abortion is called fetal murder and you and your girlfriend can go to prison for this. If y'all didn't want a baby, then y'all should have used protection in the first place. I'm pretty sure McDonalds isn't gonna kill your unborn child either.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	That's really messed up. Seriously. If you weren't prepared to risk having a baby, don't have sex. Adoption, or look into having a family member adopt--which is a lot cheaper, and better, especially if you're interested in watching the child grow without the responsibilities of taking care of him or her.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	So your trying to make her have a miscarriage instead of an abortion? That's stupid, just call planned parenthood; tell them you have no money, no support and no job. They will get it done for very cheap by having donations cover most of it. Have her do the pill method because it is just like having a miscarriage except you chose it. Anything else is simply not safe, call the clinic!|`|mC4mnvGFaa	none of those work and some are relly dangerous, Go to a doctor and find a free clinic, SOON  You could try 2 month's worth of birth control at one time. It works for a morning after pill. It may work as late as 3 months.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	you guys should be calling/talking to planned parenthood|`|yiux97Wbaa	zach, you think its hard to raise a child that is normal try raising a child with special needs after its been messed up.  Listen, if you don't want the child or in this case if your girlfriend doesn't want the child give it up for adoption, there are many people that would love to have the child and give him/her a good loving home.  Remember, you are dealing with a living breathing child and you will be held responsible for your actions, possibly by a court of law and jail time if you do not take proper care of this child.  Go to planned parenthood and do things the right way, Man up and take responsibility the right way.|`|ufcQlbGNaa	I doubt the shaking the coke thing would work as the hole that goes from the vagina to the uterus is closed (cervix) and that just sounds too stupid, i would go to counselling to see what options other than abortion are, many people cant have children, so adoption is a good thing. If you are serious about it, I have heard Large doses of vitamin C can trigger your period, which in effect would cause a miscarriage.|`|WZQKevt8aa	umm... maybe you should get counseling and get your head read first and then maybe go to your doctor so your gf can get proper medical advice. If she has a 'backyard' abortion it could make her seriously ill or it could even kill her. Try adoption.<br>  Oh, and maybe you should have done your research before you had sex so you could have known that unprotected sex does lead to pregnancy. Next time use contraception.|`|WLLqdPXeaa	Be bold to marry your girl friend. Don't abort the child. Enjoy the life with your sweet heart and have more child with her consent in future. We were born because our parrents had not aborted us. In fact life is a precious gift of God and abortion is a legal crime. Best of luck and lots of wishes.|`|Z7qxXNl0aa	If you go to your states welfare office they will pay for your pregnant girlfriends procedure...and I have had an abortion before and i do regret it but i understand your decision..be 120% sure if your going to have an abortion|`|tLilNlptaa	Don't beleive all of those hog wash rumors about homemade abortions. Besides they could put her health at risk. You should go to planned parent hood, get the abortion, have the child adopted or just man up and raise it.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	I think you should listen to Kimmeh, that was a very wise answer.|`|AhKhQquEaa	adoption|`|ATBHG0ztaa	Please don't listen to those who weren't willing to answer your question. I don't agree with or support abortion, but there's no point in being nasty and uneducated.<br>  <br>  There are no other 'alternatives'. It's not like the movies, and the possibilities of her miscarrying are slim. Using any method you suggested would only severely hurt the baby, and also your girlfriend. It would still be in there though. If she wants to abort the baby (notice I said she, not you) then you both need to get the money together and talk to Planned Parenthood. That is your only safe option. Anything else could leave you with far higher costs and trips to the emergency room for trying other methods.<br>  <br>  I know someone who worked at PP and they ask you if you're insured, working, how much you make, etc. If you say no to all of the above, you will definitely be eligible for aid. It will cut the cost in half. Depending on your state it should be 200-300 dollars.<br>  <br>  If you can't get that money together, for the sake of her health if nothing else, apply for Medicaid, which will cover all her doctor visits during pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.<br>  <br>  Keep your girlfriend's safety in mind here too please. Once again, any of the above method's would put her at serious risk for injury or possible death, so please be responsible.|`|UqDIhxcdaa	ANY alternative is illegal for a reason. The regular abortion is bad enough but amatuer one will be alot worse. Have you considered adoption? If you are that poor maybe you could make money with a private adoption. Not suggesting it tho as it is illegal. But anything is better than an abortion legal or illegal.|`|DGXX26W2aa	uhh dude send her/him to me and ill man the **** up and deal with responsibilities.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	There's nothing safe and effective. Abortion is the only option.<br>  <br>  Harriet

hprR6qfHaa	Maybe you shouldn't have murdered your poor little future child.<br>  :(<br>  <br>  No but really :), your mom probably did you a huge favor; you made the right choice.  Your life would be immensely worse if you had the burden of a child.  Furthermore, you made the choice yourself - your mom is not and has never been the ruler of your actions.  Accept what happened - you made a mistake and fixed it - and move on.<br>  <br>  Edit, in response to the above: Also, realize that even if you are less happy now, there are so many other women who are more happy and can actually live their life after an abortion.  Restricting their choice because of your personal experience would be wrong, and would make you feel even worse.|`|mxixfE3Raa	I know it's hard. Exactly this happened to my sister. You need to realise that obviously there was a reason why you had an abortion.<br>  Could you have coped financially?<br>  Could you really raise a child by yourself?<br>  Would your mother have supported you?<br>  Would you be able to go back to work or education?<br>  Were you mentally ready for a child?<br>  <br>  If the answer was no to any of these, then you need to realise that when you're ready, you can have a child, and you will be soo happy, and be able to give it everything you want and your child can have both parents and be loved.<br>  <br>  If you had had your child it may not have had the perfect life you would have wished for your child.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds bad but you can only get over it if you think of reasons of why abortion was the best idea.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	you need some sort of therapy/support group.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	Stop blaming your mom.  It's not like she put a gun to your head.  You put yourself in that situation by getting pregnant and you ultimately made the decision to have an abortion.  So stop putting your mistake off on other people and start working on clearing your own conscience.<br>  <br>  I suggest you do some volunteer work; maybe help out at a homeless shelter or work with at-risk kids.  Do something good for the world.  You can never take back the abortion.  It's over and done.  But you can do your best to balance it out with good deeds.  Not only will it make you feel better, you'll be making a difference in other people's lives.|`|Ri2I8Ofuaa	i think the best think to do is to go and see ur doctor and they will help you with support groups etc. have you tried talking to some one going through the same thing? i think this will really help you. i was forced into sex when i was 14 and got pregnant,,,,i had an abortion and although i dont regret it i still often get upset about it, talking about it with my close friend really help me. <br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxxx|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	You can't go back and change the past. You can only change your future. <br>  If you really want a relationship with your mom, my suggestion is that you need to let it go and forgive yourself and her too. Your mom was telling you to do what she thought was best for you at the time. And ultimately, you chose to go have the abortion. She didn't hold a gun to your head, you made the choice, even if she was pushy about it.  It's not her fault that you got pregnant or that you finally chose to get the abortion and I think that directing your anger at her helps you to deal with your own guilt over your choice.<br>  <br>  Then you need to forgive yourself. You can't beat yourself up forever. You are going to have to come to terms with it because you can't change it. You did what you thought was right for you at that time. You may feel now like it was a mistake, but there are a million things I have done in life that I feel now was a mistake. But every choice in life, every mistake, every experience can be taken as a chance to learn something and become a better person. Maybe when you have a baby in the future, you will be a better mother because you will appreciate your child more. Maybe you will remember how your mom pushed you and be more supportive of your own children because of it. <br>  <br>  Just learn what you can and move forward. If you need someone to talk to, email me through here. I had an abortion before too. I won't judge you or be mean to you. Also, plz ignore the nasty comments that I'm sure your question will bring out. If the answer isn't helpful, ignore it, it's only other people's opinions.|`|TrHpVTmwaa	well i know u said u didn't want one and ur mom forced you or whatever<br>  but was ur baby! and u didn't have to do it<br>  <br>  i tihnk a good way for u too be hapy again<br>  <br>  is join a group that protests abortion and tell tem ur story and tell it world wide<br>  <br>  then people can learn from it, so they know not to do it<br>  <br>  cause abortion is NEVERRRR the way|`|LjLrSUSEaa	Hey, <br>  <br>  Go to rachelsvineyard.org.

AA11785285	Why not?  Several reasons.<br>  <br>  Because it likely won't be as effective, and likely will come off. and if it is the only bc you are using, it is as if you had unprotected sex.  <br>  <br>  And condoms are only 87% effective anyway... for sure good, but you won't then be able to see if it leaked, and thus won't know if you ought to find someone 18+ to then buy you plan B  <br>  <br>  (Which you ought to have around anyway), and as well, she ought to be on the pill...bc is free at Planned Parenthood, and they don't even call your parents.<br>  <br>  So, yes, you for sure can use one in a spa, but it might not prevent a pregnancy .<br>  <br>  Hon, you get a lot of bad information from the 12  and 13 year old who do the major answering on this site..............|`|596N0bRXaa	yes you can.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	I LOVE SEX IN THE BATh THATS THE BEST!!!

There is no reason why you couldn't. <br>  They are made to be waterproof, during sex they are bound to get wet.|`|pDajM08Xaa	No, i wouldnt because the condom could slip off if you have bubbles in their etc, do a bit of reasearch. and find out.|`|98WKYtfwaa	What's a comdom?|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	yup...duh|`|p11HaDIWaa	duh why not???

ZvKw1XDmaa	You don't even have to ejaculate inside her to get her pregnant, and women can get pregnant at any stage of their cycle.|`|AA11763588	Umm... yes.<br>  <br>  Most women ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day they START their period and sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.|`|AA12165157	big chance
AA11918778	Mine just turned 7 months and has been this way from the beginning whereas my other baby slept long stretches almost right away.  All babies are different.  This baby for me is more clingy and we nurse a lot at night.  You will get there I promise - just hang in there.  <br>  <br>  What helps for us and it isn't for everyone is to safely co-sleep with our baby so he can nurse on demand - we did this until last month and now he sleeps longer stretches in his crib and I get up when he starts to fuss and put him in bed with me long enough to nurse and fall back asleep then return him to his crib.  <br>  <br>  At around 4 months or so they start to learn to trust you more - they learn that when you aren't right there you will still come back.  Just be patient.  Breastfed babies do eat more often and they also tend to long for that comfort.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter still does that, and she's seven months. It's very rare for a baby who's breastfed to sleep more than that at night at such a young age. Hang in there.|`|9kPPmazoaa	My 14 week old does the exact same thing.... She "may" sleep for 3-4 hours every once in a while. But she normally only sleeps 2 hours at a time. Every night she goes down around 8 pm... and we (lol) are up at 10,1, 3, & 5:30.  For the most part every 2-3 hours we are up. And sometimes she doesn't want to go back to sleep- those nights are hard.<br>  <br>  I've been advised (by friends) to add a small scoop of rice cereal to my daughters milk to fill her up. Because in her case... I believe she is waking up so frequently because she only drinks 3-4 oz at a time. I normally when she wakes at night change her/feed her, and she doses off again. I've tried to get her to eat more than 4 oz but she wont take anymore than that, she'll just spit it out... <br>  <br>  If I were you I'd consult your sons pediatrician first... before trying that. I actually haven't tried the rice cereal thing myself. Because I want to talk to her pediatrician first.<br>  <br>  Just want to wish you the best of luck... And hopefully we will get some sleep soon!|`|LbwpUA1caa	Welcome to parenthood.  This is very normal.  Then just when they start sleeping longer then they develop gas.  When that goes away they start teething.  Remember to take some time for yourself to relax.  Have a family member watch the baby every now and then.  If the baby is without gas, fed, and not teething it is ok to let him cry gently.  Sometimes they will cry themselves back to sleep in about 10 minutes.  But the feeding every 3-4 hours is normal.|`|IDS64Eh8aa	I agree with mommy&wife, my daughter is 8 months and does the same, it will get better eventually|`|B6tGYfEgaa	aaaaw you poor thing. i am one of the very lucky few with a baby sleeping through the night. my baby is four months and i breastfeed on demand. we stay up very late, me and my husband, and she'll go down usually after a feed around eleven or twelve or one and then sometimes wake up a bit and then sometimes sleep again- normally i'd lift her before my own bedtime (maybe three or four) and feed her and put her back down and she'll sleep until noon with me. i don't need to hear any judegements on the situation, by the way. i'm a night person and a writer and a bartender and this is how it will be until it needs to change (like if i got a day job, which is unlikely- definitely by the time she starts school). anyway i feel this guilt for being so lucky and wish i could help more. here are some possibilities: make sure he/she is well burped all the time. it took me a while to realize that a lot of times when she woke up crying it was gas. also, i had some troubles breastfeeding in the past and also she didn't sleep through the night then. now i make sure she's getting both the hindmilk and the foremilk (check 'kelley mom' for breastfeeding, online, it's the best website!!!)- the hindmilk is the 'foody' part and fills their tummies, while the foremilk is more like water (i.e. for thirst). we are lucky too because ours doesn't sleep too much in the day (maybe a couple hours), so it's possible that helps her sleep through the night. i think it's important to make sure they nap and aren't too tired to go to sleep (no naps of course make a baby completely lose it), but too much sleep might/would make them restless. i really, really wish you good luck. i really hope you get some sleep. my heart goes out to you.|`|fToG0uSbaa	He is probably just wanting Mommy. This is what i'm going to do if this happens (I'm 28 weeks!) I would just lay him in bed next to you. That's what my aunt did, for about 3 months. And he did much better. I plan to do that too. :]

SOYqxdC9aa	Wait a week and take a pregnant test at home.  But if you're sexually active and you don't want to become pregnant, get on the pill and use protection.  That will save you all the worry.|`|GjuRYsITaa	no|`|W6wamWLLaa	Maybe, do a pregnancy test.|`|i5fvZXkfaa	I would suggest take a pregnancy test. This happened to me also when I was a couple of weeks pregnant and one of the nerve around the umbilical cord ruptured. I had to take complete bed rest and medication in-order to have a safe pregnancy. But its very important to see a doc.|`|whnxMNYcaa	no doubt it since it came ..u shudnt have had unprotected sex anyway? especially twice..
lzcglDnMaa	Well, I am on my 4th round of clomid. I go Monday for a scan to see if I ovulated. I am on 150mg. My doctor told me that if it looks like I am going to ovulate then he gives me the hcg injection. It is shot that helps the eggs mature faster I think. He said that if I am not ovulating then the next step would be FSH injections. He said they cost about $1000 for one month. I am not sure about what your doctor is going to do for you, but you might ask about iui's and ivf. Either one of these should work, if the clomid is not working. Good luck.|`|13hFRGN9aa	i would try the injection instead of surgery. it is stronger then clomid and that should help. don't give up, it will happen.|`|iLlEoIiiaa	Im sorry you are having a hard time getting pregnant. I also went through the same thing. I tried getting pregnant for 2 years and couldn't so I got on Clomid. I ended up getting pregnant the first 2 times I used it but had miscarriages both times. The third time i didn't get pregnant at all and then I doubled my dose and ended up getting pregnant with twins!! I would stick with clomid for a little bit and see what happens because it is the cheapest fertility drug. If that doesn't work I believe the next step is invetro. Good Luck!   Also I know this sounds silly but after your done having S**  sit with your legs up in the air. I don't think it is proven to work but you might as well give it a shot and help the little swimmers out! :)|`|SzMH2na0aa	The next step by be injection medication to help you ovulate or they may go to a IUI which is you husband's sperm in injected by the doctor into you tubes on your day of ovulation, then you would move up to IVF.<br>  <br>  I hope that you get pregnant without IVF it is a very mentally and physically demanding procedure.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

mldo1vxYaa	Relax, nothing is going to happen to your daughter, its a good thing she flipped. Breech births can cause problems and thats obviously the ONLY reason the doctor was going to do the c section. Sections are harder than natural births and they take longer to get over so if you can have your baby naturally your doctor will do his very best to make sure you can.<br>  <br>  Your baby is probably not moving as much because she is in a new position and doesnt have as much room as before, also shes bigger now the next movements she will be making will be getting out! Try not to worry , nothing is going to happen to your baby, the majority of babies are born in a natural position, I would have been more worried when she was breech.|`|p11HaDIWaa	aww how cool u get to deliver naturally instead of having a horrible c-section. i can imagine how u would feel nervous and stressed because u thought u were going to meet ur precious little one yesterday but now u have to wait another 4 days before anything. but don't worry everything is going to be fine and as long as u still feel her moving then u should think negatively, good luck to u:)

With the first kid, a lot of parents have higher expectations... that's why you got in trouble more than your brother does :)|`|owTQfAmnaa	my parents do the same thing. they may not and its just how you feel but it may also be because they expect more from you or they are nmore expirienced parents now and myabe they are a little less strict|`|e8yt5PrGaa	my sister was punished more than i was ..i agree its not fair|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	In general, parents are quite cautious with the first child.  They are learning everything for the first time about parenthood and dealing with children.  By the time they get to subsequent kids, they've realized they can loosen up a bit.  (And to be honest, I think parents start getting tired at that point and let more stuff slide, lol...at least it's that way with my parents.)<br>  <br>  As the oldest child in my family, I know exactly what you are talking about.  Down to the youngest sibling...he gets away with quite a bit.  Half of what he does would have never been tolerated when I was a teen!|`|S1H8B23Iaa	what kind of spoiling is it? i mean are they giving him more things or just more of thier time.. if its just more time alone think of it as they know you are a teenager and believe its time to give you more space or they think you are more mature than your brother and can handle your own.. <br>  <br>  objects wise.. i think it is easier to buy for younger kids than teenagers.. by then you have very specific things that you are into and maybe they dont want to feel "uncool" if they get you something you dont neccessarily enjoy..<br>  <br>  hope that helps a little... just remember once he gets older it will even out.. i have a younger brother too and now that i am no longer in the house he gets alot which is weird cuz i also have an older sister who lives at home who gets what she wants... maybe me and you were just not meant to be spoiled?
TQW5E6olaa	He'll just be another new person at this age. He won't know he's a boyfriend or someone who could possibly take over for his bio dad.<br>  <br>  Just be careful about involving him in your son's day to day life. If he's around a lot and then you two break up, he could be devastated. <br>  <br>  <br>  WOW you got same haters!! Ignore them, they don't know anyhting about your situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|prqrQcd1aa	Don't let these rude people get to you... As a mother who've been through what you have i'm going to answer you honestly. My oldest has known my current boyfriend since she was in my stomach (we have known eachother for like 19 years), she is pretty much okay with him, but gets kinda cranky at times because of the whole jealousy thing..she's 7 years old though, My 3 year old adores him..calls him daddy even! (she doesn't know her real father..so since he is acting like "daddy" we don't find anything wrong with that, and also because he isn't going anywhere. My baby likes him alot too..but she is around her own father every weekend.<br>  <br>  This is the hard part that some women don't understand.. Everytime you bring a man into your life, and that man and you break up.. It's hard on your kids. Especially when his own father isn't there that often!<br>  So just be careful with all of that!|`|1gF9QVy9aa	My only advice is only introduce your son to a man when you're SURE that man will be around for the long haul.  <br>  <br>  I know he's only 7 months old....but it's a good rule to practice beginning now.  If you've been dating for awhile, sure....bring him over.  If you recently met him, I'd hold off until you know this man is right for you AND your son.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well my position is my daughter will be having a step mom...and emma i sok with her i guess. shes 15 month sand to be honest shes just another person right now, as will this guy be to your son there too young to understand. as he gets older and realises who daddy is he will ask why there is two if there is or what not. but thats something youll have to prepare for:)|`|rGci1ehoaa	at 7 months your child probably wont notice.. my daughter was 5 months when me and my husband got together..after i started dating someone new her father split and she has never seen him since... she thinks my husband is her father... she saw her father until she was about 1 but never asked where he went or what happened to him...|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I didn't let my husband meet my son until we had been dating for 10 months, that's just how I am. I don't believe in bringing people in and out of a child's life it's hard enough dealing with parents that are not together why make him deal with the drama od a relationship that might not last.|`|9K2fMQlfaa	hi! i myself am a young mother, 22 with a almost 2yr. old, and almost 7month old. At such a young age, I don't think you son will be offended by it, or even notice. Although, stranger anxiety typicaly begins around this age, so he might freak out a little at first,but not because it's not his daddy,simply because it's someone new. My kids' father was just released from jail, he was only away for 45 days, but that was enough time for our son to forget who he was, because when he held him he screamed bloody murder & reached for me. nJust take it slow is the best advice i can come up with. Also-you look great!! i'm still fat & constantly am asked if im pregnant again!! GRRR so ignore the RUDEEEE comments of haters. i'm sure you don't dress like that all day every day.
ZYlr9TSBaa	Well that depends. I felt my daughter first at 18 weeks and it felt like a "kick" not flutters. It got to 21 weeks when other people could feel her kicking so my guess would be around then :)|`|7SKVCPcSaa	around 22 weeks. and then they start getting more painful. lol!|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	I never really felt flutters. I started feeling the baby move around 14-15 weeks, but it was like a rolling type movement for me or tiny little jabs. <br>  <br>  It progressively got stronger and stronger over the next several weeks until around 20 weeks when I was at the point that it was significantly stronger and I could feel him moving multiple times a day. Still mostly rolling movements and little jabs.  <br>  <br>  Now I'm 25 weeks and about a week or so ago, the movements are finally getting strong enough that I can see the outside of my belly move sometimes and my DH can feel the baby moving when he puts his hand on me.  Now the movements are really varied and sometimes strong enough that it can be uncomfortable if he's being jabby down low or on one side. But he also does like a rolling type of movement, and a kicking like feeling, and sometimes a pushing outward where I get a funny bump... <br>  <br>  It's really fun and exciting how your baby's movements change and develop.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I had flutters from about 16weeks they just got stronger over time, it's only been the past 3/4 weeks that they've been more like kicks and punches, it depends on each individual, but for me they turned into that at around 20/22weeks.|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	I always thought kicks is the wrong word, actually. My babies were more stretches! You could see their limbs etc moving under the surface, but they didn't really pull their foot back and kick out! I'd call them squirms! Now hiccups...THEY were fascinating!|`|1IDSGM71aa	I started feeling flutters between 12 and 15 weeks, then started feeling harder kicks around 18-20 weeks, I think. I think my husband could feel them around 23 weeks or so.|`|sRvgHISSaa	you start to feel it more closer to 20 weeks one day they will give you a big kick and it will take you by surprise thats what happened with mine. sometimes if a loud noise makes them jump they will kick harder x
kHuyMTYKaa	Buy the same size as you would in briefs, you don't want to go larger since an athletic cup needs to fit rather snuggly so that it doesn't move around and cause irritation or pain. Check and see if the cup is removable, if it is then you can always buy a different size to slide into the brief if one doesn't fit properly. Good Luck on the Varsity Team...great job, well done!|`|oIyXMnmcaa	The link did not work for me...either way though, Geoffrey was about that size just last year but weighed more--I would chose the youth regular personally, Geoffrey's fit nicely and you want to make sure the cup stays nice and close for protection. Are you ordering online? If possible I would go into the store with him and get some professional advice from one of the sporting workers just casue this is an important part of his uniform and you want his man region to be properly protected. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	That link didn't work for me, but I looked through the site and I think I found the one you are talking about.<br>  If he wears a size 14/16 in his normal briefs then that's what I would buy.  But i'm sure the regular would fit him also. <br>  I didn't check the price but if they're inexpensive could you buy both?<br>  If not, just stick with the 14/16 seeing as you know that should fit. Or ask your son which he would prefer.<br>  Good luck :)
ZYlr9TSBaa	That's possible. I nurse my daughter while i'm on here lol. I'm nursing her at this moment in time :o) but it took me a couple of weeks before it got comfy enough for me to do it.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	You can do a lot of things while nursing. Read a book, watch TV, I even managed to fold laundry while nursing and carry the baby around the house while nursing. You will adapt to it and before long you wont even think about it.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	Once I got the hang of it I'd try to multi task but it seemed more trouble than it was worth. My kids were very efficient nursers and didn't take long to get their fill. By the time I'd try to entertain myself they were done so it wasn't really necessary. I did get good at breastfeeding while I walked around the house cleaning up and organizing though. It's amazing what you can get done with one hand.|`|4iXL4C6paa	While breastfeeding my first one I would put my full attention on him, try to make him comfortable, and all of that stuff (which is all good) ....but now that I am breastfeeding # 4 I have got it down, I could play video games, read, work on my puzzle books, help the other 3 with there work ......so yes it is possible.|`|8b9e5894f70e3364d0f2490295d49b82aa	get online, watch TV, eat sometimes, read a book, etc. <br>  <br>  There are lots of things you can do, once you get the hang of it.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I go on my laptop, or have a drink.. mainly things I can do one handed. I try to eat sometimes but it never works lol.|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	NAK - nursed at keyboard.  Great way to get your breastfeeding support.<br>  <br>  I also read alot, watched movies, slept (dozed), relaxed and enjoyed my baby.<br>  <br>  I'd be cautious of any sudden and loud noises and movements from using the XBOX and I wouldn't spend all your breastfeeding time playing games, but occasionally, why not?|`|RPBeYbx9aa	You can bf hands free. <br>  get the baby comfortable, holding their head close to you with your hands (body supported by the pillow) adn use either a blanket or something to replace your hand in supporting the head. You may need to use your thighs to keep him close to you. works for me all the time :)
Ej2EOsvKaa	Well so far I have been pregnant for 4months! And the first three months well I dont mean this in a bad way but they sucked! Just because of being sick! I could not enjoy the pregnancy! YOu cant go out and eat it just sucks! But this month has been so much better, I dont get tired and its just so much fun watching mybelly grow! <br>  Its true what the others are saying. IT is amazing how we create other humans (now that sounds dumb i know) but really it is a work of art. <br>  Being pregnant is just awsome and when you experience this you will be saying the same thing. (that is if you dont get morning sickness) <br>  Hope this helped! Its truly a blessing the whole way through! Good luck!!<br>  <br>  :)|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	It's something you've got to go through to really understand it, no two pregnancies are the same. But for me, I loved it. Sure I was uncomfortable, couldn't do much but my god, feeling my daughter kicking was amazing..... I miss it :(|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Being pregnant and knowing you created something so wonderful,beautiful and precious inside of you is the most amazing,wonderful,happy undescribable experience there ever is.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you are tired most of the time<br>  <br>  once belly is out your back hurts<br>  <br>  but when you feel those kicks and that movement its like you smile everytime. <br>  <br>  i love feeling my little guy moving...i cant wait to meet him<br>  <br>  all the pain is SO worth the wait...and everyone says I'll miss him moving inside of me and i think i will<br>  he is more protected in me than out...|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	It's a little scary if it's your first time, but it is the best feeling in the whole world.  The other day, my husband and I are having an argument, and I felt the baby moved in my tummy.  The fight stop and I was just smiling, as if nothing else matters.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	some people love it and have a great time with no problems.  For me it was different.  I was vomiting a lot, back pain, hip pain, moody/irritable, tired, lost lots of sleep, pain when he moved, terrible sciatica and a sinus infection that made me snore like a monster.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It's really hard to explain. You have to experience it, to really know. All I can say, is that it's the best feeling in the world.|`|1w41ReD7aa	Well,I'm not married, but have been with the same boyfriend since the 7th grade & were currently in college right now. I'm only 12 weeks pregnant, I've gained 17 pounds already lol & I don't have morning sickness anymore or anything. At 16 weeks I'm going to a 3d/4d place & find out the sex of my baby. Were really excited! & it was a planned pregnancy & it just brings a smile to your face knowing you have a little baby growing in your tummy! I can't wait (:|`|xw0k1wwGaa	I remember asking myself the same thing when I was younger. Now that I am actually pregnant, it's so surreal. Just thinking that there is a little one growing INSIDE you makes you have goosebumps. Also, I feel very emotional all the time. Whenever I think about holding my baby, I start to tear up just because I am so excited! Physically, it's difficult to get used to being pregnant. Constant fatigue, headaches, growing pains and everything like that wears you down. But to be completely honest with you, all of the physical difficulties are SO worth it. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you answer your question!|`|mpXiHvY2aa	I am only 7 weeks pregnant with my first baby and it's exciting and scary at the same time. To be honest, it feels almost surreal at this point. Thankfully I haven't had any nausea or any pregnancy symptoms that some women experience except for the obvious missing of my period and fatigue (hopefully it stays this way!).  We have our first doctor's appointment next week and I'm hoping to be able to hear the baby's heartbeat for the first time and praying that everything will be ok.  Very exciting though!!|`|AA11542929	its hard to explain, but its a beautiful feeling, hearing the heartbeat for the very 1st time, seeing them grow on ultrasounds when u have them, feeling them kick, punch, and getting the hiccups.. its so blessing to be pregnant.. when u have a baby you'll see what i mean by all that.. its a long process to deal with, a difficult one at times but its so cute to feel a body inside of you growing and knowing that its there listening to you all day.. its a great feeling.. you'll see one day.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	It's hard to explain, and different for everyone. You really have to experience it. To me, it is the second best thing in the world, only second to actually holding my daughter for the first time.<br>  Remember though, there are bad things; morning sickness, cramps, not being able to move. But the better things make the bad things fade into the background.<br>  It's a beautiful thing, you will love it when the time is ready.|`|mFEevGRXaa	Its an awesome feeling!! i love it, we are expecting in may and i am getting pretty big at this point so its a little awkward doing certain things and sleeping and being comfortable takes a little getting used to but i love it!!  my husband says its weird when the baby kicks, he says its weird to have another human inside of a human, but that is just a man for ya, he's funny!|`|U2N5kQmlaa	well  you think having a baby is hard but my sis pregnancy was hard she got kidney stones because how the baby sat so it can be hard but some people have a very easy pregnancy.
R0EsQapRaa	I totally understand how you are feeling.  I would say for the first month I did not feel the bond with my daughter either.  Just like your baby she would cry everytime I held her or tried to comfort her, but was fine when anyone else held her.  <br>  <br>  As time went on I relaxed a little more and I think my baby sensed it.  I was overwhelmed, too.  Within a month or so the bonding occured and now she is 10 months old and loves her mama!!!<br>  <br>  It will get better...I promise ;)|`|AA12243380	Give it time, give it time.  I don't think I fell completely and totally in love with my son and adored breastfeeding him until he was around 6 weeks or so.  The love comes more and more every day.  Trust me!!|`|avx7bLnKaa	This is normal! Whenever you hold him he cries cause he wants to nurse... It's a comfort thing<br>  We all feel like cows at first and the bonding is lost in the intial exhaustion.<br>  It does get better<br>  <br>  During the first 4 weeks after my first son was born I ranted and raved all around my house... Complaining and crying in frustration that I didn't want to breastfeed anymore... I wanted to sleep and not have the baby on me 24/7 and that I wouldnot breastfeed my next child<br>  <br>  After. The intial 4-6 weeks I really enjoyed breastfeeding and started to gaze at my son while he nursed... I enjoyed breastfeeding and I bonded with my son... I was said when he self weaned at 8 months<br>  <br>  I am currently nursing my 3 1/2 month old.. It was alot easier this time. I still felt like a mill machine in the begining<br>  But it does get better<br>  <br>  It gets alot better<br>  <br>  Good luck! Keep at it! Good luck!|`|lRq81lu7aa	Sometimes bonding with your baby takes time.  For a tiny baby they can sense when you are upset, impatient or anxious.  Try to relax with him sing or hum a tune when you breastfeed it may take your mind off being milk machine for a bit.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor if the feelings persist.  It may be postpartum depression kicking in but it could be more than that.  I don't want to give you that label of "oh, you are just depressed", because it doesn't affect just you, its affecting your baby.<br>  <br>  The first six weeks I felt like all I was for my daughter was a maid.  Clean her up, feed her, rock her, watch her, feed her again, change her.<br>  <br>  It took me awhile to get used to her also, I was exhausted from her delivery so I didn't learn how to enjoy her yet.  It takes time.  Hang in there.|`|3b7353a5b3964fb01515994f11e457f4aa	Don't be too hard on yourself. I think  you're stressed because you do not have a lot of sleep. Breastfeeding is a bit harder because you need to wake up every 2-3 hours but rest assured your baby is getting the best nutrients.<br>  <br>  If you want to have a good rest, you can buy/rent an electric breast pump and store your milk in the freezer and bottle feed the baby. <br>  <br>  In the  beginning, it is going to be tough. But when he's 3 months, it should be easier.  So you have 3 months to sacrifice. YOu can do it. Hang in there.|`|2VJJPCMiaa	Believe it or not, it comes in time for some women.  I never felt that 'ultimate' attachment for my first baby for about 3 months.  I just fed, changed and burped her.  It's kind of monotonous, but wait til the first smile!  You could try making a check list mentally or on paper for crying.  Find the most comfortable way to feed him and do it that way, when he follows your lead of being relaxed, he will relax.  Talk to him in a gentle voice, sing to him gently and just keep mooning over him.  If he starts crying, check if he is hungry, if not, try changing, if not, try burping.  Eventually you will learn what cry means what and you'll know better than anyone about your baby.  As his development goes on, add it to the checklist, too hot? too cold? back or tummy?, etc.  It takes a little getting used to but you sound like you love your son and I promise it will happen.|`|G0bBzkgYaa	i don't think there is really anything you can do to make yourself feel more bonded to your son.  sometimes it just takes a bit.  everyone told me how it was love at first sight when they had their babies so i thought something was wrong with me when it took me about a month to feel that bond with my son.  it's normal, though.  right now you are exhausted and your hormones are still out of whack and it's hard to bond sometimes.  my son done the same thing as far as crying with me then settling down for everyone else.  people told me that it was because i would be tense when i picked him up and he could sense that which would just make him upset more.  there was nothing i could do about it though.  when he screamed i would get upset, too.  he is now almost 7 months old and is a complete momma's boy.  he cries when anyone else holds him now and calms down with me.  not necessarily a good thing for him to be so attached, but at least i know he loves me.  it just takes time.  good luck.|`|e352f0e5fe4df3944adff4dbdcf007bfaa	First, R-E-L-A-X.<br>  If you're frustrated or upset your son will sense this and will become upset as well.<br>  <br>  Second, you should look in his eyes and talk to him. This helps with the bonding process during feeedings, baths and bedtime. The more time you spend together, the better your chances are at having a good relationship.<br>  <br>  Third, if this doesn't work - its not the end. All babies are different and do things at their own pace. The fact that you're worried shows you care and you're already a great mom.|`|v7f2bjpfaa	I felt the same way, in fact I had a good cry to my mom about the exact same thing when my son was just under two weeks.  I think at about a month I felt that bonding, but it was gradual.  Give it time, it does happen (right now you have hormones and are in survival mode due to no sleep.)  I would sing and dace with my son to help the bonding.  If you still feel like you are not bonding or like things are getting worse, talk to your doctor or your sons doctor.  <br>  <br>  The breast feeding is frustrating, but if you can keep at it it really does pay off for your little one.  If not though many babies have been formula fed, and I bet if you ask your grandparents what they used to feed our parents you'll be surprised your parents ever survived haha.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	It's still pretty early on for the two of you. Give yourselves some time. These first couple of months, your baby is going to take and take and take some more. But one day he'll smile at you and you're going to feel a surge of love so strong it will knock you off your feet. Be patient honey. It will come.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	trust me, its just your hormones making you feel that way!

The association of semi-vegetarianism with vegetarianism in popular vernacular, particularly pescetarianism (also called pesco-vegetarianism and described as a "vegetarian" diet that includes fish has led to what vegetarian groups cite as improper categorisation of these diets as vegetarian. The Vegetarian Society, which initiated popular usage of the term vegetarian as early as 1847, condemns the association of semi-vegetarian diets as valid vegetarianism; the organisation points out that the consumption of fish is not vegetarian.<br>       Best of Luck, I hope I helped|`|nZRZvsszaa	Nope, vegetarians do not eat fish. <br>  A branch of vegetarian does eat fish, but no other animals.

JoCPiWLeaa	Hello Big and Beautiful<br>  I myself am a big girl and I just want to tell you that it is VERY possible to get pregnant and carry the baby. I am 5'5 as well and at the time I weighed 235. I gained about 12pounds during the pregnancy. The doctor advised that you don't necessarily have to gain the full amount of weight that is recommended which is around 20-25 pounds. The baby is going to feed of you regardless. Keep trying and track your ovulation days per month and you WILL be successful. Good luck to you and if you have any more questions PLEASE email me.|`|KmbgmSYiaa	I'm sorry to say this but hypertension and obesity are related. Yes heredity is a factor but you can try to help yourself by losing weight. I sorta had the same problem. My BMI was 31 when i got pregnant but I had a miscarriage. Doctor said it had nothing to do with my being overweight but I knew I should do something about my health. So I lost a couple of pounds and my BMI now is 29. Its still borderline obesity but I'm very worried about preeclampsia (hypertension during pregnancy).  It can be very dangerous and yes you should be worried. I really suggest you should try to lose weight first. But if you happen to get pregnant now, make sure you eat healthy, avoid salts, junk food esp those high in cholesterol.

Right now I am going to try to lose at least 20 pounds because I think it will help me out...a lot.

At your weight, and since you don't want to wait much longer to get pregnant I would try and start working out, and eating healthier. If you could lose 10% of your body weight than you will beniefit a lot from that, and you will feel much better about yourself!
WPI0Z47saa	That isn't alot at all. 25-35 pounds is the recommended weight gain and you still aren't there yet. Many woman go over that anyway and still lose the weight later.

So I think you are doing fine.|`|ITu6gONdaa	It sounds perfectly normal to me. In reality you have only gained 10 lbs in 25 weeks. Its not bad at all.

I lost weight at the start of my pregnancy and now seem to be putting it on (I am 29 weeks) I figure that this is because my appetite has started to come back and baby is also beginning to fill out. I  think that as long as you listen to your body and do what it says you will be fine. Stay as fit as possible and eat as well as you can but if an extra packet of crisps or a chocolate bar make their way into your shopping trolly - don't worry. <br>  <br>  Good luck with the next few weeks.|`|AA11830777	I wouldn't worry about the weight gain. Everyone is different. It's not an excessive amount of weight.

I would not be too worried at this stage, as it is normal to pick up 22lbs or more in your first and second pregnancies. With third and fourth pregnancies you tend to show earlier and pick weight up earlier. If you are having problems with water around your ankles, then yes, I would be a little concerned, but if not then your pregnancy is completely normal.
dInKk1wDaa	I use to be bulimic and anorexic when I was younger too.  Even though I have over come it, I still have days where I see all my hard work slowly disappearing and start to feel anxious.  I am trying to overcome the anxiety by talking with my husband when I get scared and by doing deep breathing exercises.<br>  <br>  What I am doing right now is working with a trainer who specializes in pregnancy once a week and staying overall fit.  I also have plans post pregnancy to do things to lose weight like breast feed, jogging with a jogging stroller and joining a gym.<br>  <br>  I am trying to focus on the big picture and realize that I probably will get most of my body back.  It will take some hard work, but when I first got to college I gained the freshman 15 and was unable to lose it until grad school by changing my diet and adding moderate exercise.

eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	in the old days girls were teen moms and married young because life expectancy was a lot shorter and nothing more was expected of a girl then. Now, girls have so many options, they are allowed to go to college, and get careers...so when people see a teen girl becoming pregnant now they think her life will basically be over and they won't be able to accomplish what everyone thinks she should be accomplishing.|`|wZAeBisbaa	WHEN: It happened when young people began to delay marriage and childbearing in favor of getting an education and a job. This was a trend that began with industrialization, but it didn't become widespread among women until the 1970's, when they began to enter the labor force in large numbers. <br>  <br>  WHY: Being a teen mom can make it more difficult for a young woman to go to school or work.  In the past, this was resolved by getting married, and the husband would support the mother and baby. Today very few young people see pregnancy as a compelling reason to marry.  This means that a young mom will have much more of the burden of supporting herself, or the taxpayers will take on some of it.  This is the reason why teen motherhood is generally frowned upon.  <br>  <br>  It's not an entirely valid reason, in my mind, because the educational disadvantages of early motherhood have been steadily diminishing, and even those  young moms who rely on taxpayers tend to do so for only a short time. But the public for the most part does not look at the details.  They see only the stereotype.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	over the years A LOT has changed. when my grandmother got married at  16-17 years old she didn't have the choices that girls do today. in that time period that's how things went. there was no going to college and women having careers. the woman actually got married, had a home and stayed home to raise their kids (or like my grandmother worked in a sewing factory when her kids went to school) while their husbands worked . there were no other options.<br>  these days young girls are going off and getting pregnant with NO home of their own, NO one to help look after the child (unless they are depending on family), NO financial way to take care of these kids and etc. back then girls were often way more mature and these days girls just think 'its like a bunch of fun' and its not. they are being irresponsible about it. not to mention all the options women have these days. going to school, having a career....  <br>  oh and i have to say when my grandmother was a girl ...if you had sex before you were married you were looked down upon... now girls are having sex with LOTS of boys not just one and oops i got pregnant...that kind of stuff NEVER would have been tolerated when my grandmother was a girl... they would have been sent away to 'live with an aunt' for 9 months. and i know this because i have had extensive conversations about this with my grandparents and even parents.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	In General;<br>  young (15 year old) teenagers are not financially supported by their partners (who are usually still in school anyway) and today, are unable to get married at such a young age.<br>  Education should be completed and financial security should be obtained before starting a family,. A 15 year old has neither.<br>  The burden of raising the child usually falls to the 15 year old girl's own parents.<br>  A 15 year old girl, generally, does not have the experience, knowledge, maturity or emotional stability to properly care for a baby.<br>  There are also more health risks with having a baby at a young age. Risks to both the mother and the baby.<br>  These days the life expectancy for a woman can be up to 80 or more years. It is expected that children will finish their schooling.<br>  Back when it was not unusual for a 15 year old girl to marry (ie 1900-1920), education for girls was lacking. They had to get married to survive. It was expected that they would transition from family home to married life at a young age, to lessen the financial impact of their upbringing on their own family. Instead of receiving formal education, most girls only completed some primary school (were out of school between 9 and 12) and were taught house duties to prepare them for marriage. Back in the day, life expectancy was also much shorter than it is today. Hence the need to start a family of a young age<br>  In your grandmother's day it was less common for girls to be married by the time they were 17 and it was a more common occurence in larger families. Again, it's due to families not having the money to educate their daughters so it was expected they would marry at a young age<br>  Fortunately, times have changed and women usually have the same access to education and employment that men do. Women don't need to marry to survive. They are capable of obtaining well-paying careers and they can make the responsible decision to wait until they have a home and financial security before bringing another life into this world. <br>  Edit To Agnapostate.

My point was that early childbearing could result in increased security in the labor market later on in life for poor mothers, so that they wouldn't need to interrupt any work phase.<br>  <br>  I'm quite aware that there are numerous "studies" that indicate that teenage childbearing impose deleterious economic consequences on teenage parents and their children. The problem is that many studies on teenage pregnancy and childbearing commit several critical methodological errors in that they fail to measure external environmental factors of different women who gave birth in their teenage years, one of the most critical of these being their family background. Researchers Geronimus and Korenman have conducted an analysis of the available data without committing this critical error, and thus find that the the "costs" of teenage childbearing are drastically overstated in "The Socioeconomic Costs of Teen Childbearing Reconsidered."<br>  <br>  "Teen childbearing is commonly belied to cause long-term socioeconomic disadvantages for mothers and their children. However, earlier cross-sectional studies may have inadequately accounted for marked differences in family backgrounds among women who have first births at different ages. We present new estimates that take into account unmeasured family background heterogeneity by comparing sisters who timed their first births at different ages. In two of the three data sets we examine, sister comparisons suggest that biases from family background heterogeneity are important, and, therefore, that earlier studies may have overstated the consequences of teen childbearing."  <br>  <br>  To underscore this point even further, I would also point to an interesting study conducted for the federal white paper, Kids Having Kids, that did not fall into the trap of committing several methodological errors of the nature that other studies on teenage pregnancy do. <br>  <br>  "In Kids Having Kids, (my note: this is an oxymoron) researchers Hotz, Sanders, and McElroy used a new and innovative research approach that potentially controls for individual risk factors that cannot be directly measured and that can potentially lead to misleading (biased) estimates of the impact of a mother’s age at birth. This new approach used a 'natural experiment'—that is, a group of women who became pregnant and had a birth as a teen are compared to a group of women who became pregnant as a teen but had a miscarriage—as a way to approximate the results of a random assignment to having a teen birth. While there are concerns about sample sizes and other related measurement issues in this particular application, the Hotz et al. approach has substantial value in measuring true causal impacts… and its results have become the research standard at this point and they are used here for that reason (pp 20, 22)."  <br>  <br>  Moreover, while reviewing Hotz et al., it is curious to note that their study goes even further than that of Geronimus and Korenman in rebutting the claims that teenage pregnancy is a cause of numerous socioeconomic problems. In fact, Hotz et al. found the precise opposite to be true.<br>  <br>  "Our major finding is that many of the apparent negative consequences of teenage child bearing on the subsequent socioeconomic attainment of teen mothers are much smaller than those found in studies that use alternative methodologies to identify the causal effects of teenage childbearing. We also find evidence that teenage mothers earn more in the labor market at older ages than they would have earned if they had delayed their births." <br>  <br>  This point is emphasized and re-emphasized repeatedly, highlighting just how great a contradiction of the "usual wisdom" it is, and how woefully inadequate that "usual wisdom" becomes when methodological errors used to find it are uncovered. <br>  <br>  "Our results suggest that much of the “concern” that has been registered regarding teenage childbearing is misplaced, at least based on its consequences for the subsequent educational and economic attainment of teen mothers. In particular, our estimates imply that the “poor” outcomes attained by such women cannot be attributed, in a causal sense, primarily to their decision to begin their childbearing at an early age. Rather, it appears that these outcomes are more the result of social and economic circumstances than they are the result of the early childbearing of these women. Furthermore, our estimates suggest that simply delaying their childbearing would not greatly enhance their educational attainment or subsequent earnings or affect their family structure…For most outcomes, the adverse consequences of early childbearing are short-lived. For annual hours of work and earnings, we find that a teen mother would have lower levels of each at older ages if they had delayed their childbearing."  <br>  <br>  They determine that teenage childbearing can be a viable economic strategy for many. <br>  <br>  "Concentrating their childbearing at early ages may prove to be more compatible with their labor market career options than postponing their childbearing to older ages would be…The magnitudes of these estimated effects of teenage childbearing on subsequent labor market earnings are sizeable. Over the ages of 21 through 35, teen mothers earned an average $7,917 per year (in 1994 dollars). Based on the “All Covariates” estimates in Table 6, teen mothers would have earned an average of 31 percent less per year if they had delayed their childbearing."  <br>  <br>  It is also critical to note that because of the innovative research method that it uses, Hotz et al. does not fall prey to the numerous methodological issues mentioned by Geronimus and Korenman.<br>  <br>  "In this study, we have used an alternative and innovative strategy to estimate the causal effects associated with teenage childbearing in the U.S. In particular, we have focused on women who first become pregnant as teenagers and employ a natural experiment to obtain a more comparable,and plausible, comparison group with which to derive estimates of counterfactual outcomes for teen mothers. Our results suggest that much of the “concern” that has been registered regarding teenage childbearing is misplaced, at least based on its consequences for the subsequent educational and economic attainment of teen mothers. In particular, our estimates imply that the “poor” outcomes attained by such women cannot be attributed, in a causal sense, primarily to their decision to begin their childbearing at an early age. Rather, it appears that these outcomes are more the result of social and economic circumstances than they are the result of the early childbearing of these women. Furthermore, our estimates suggest that simply delaying their childbearing would not greatly enhance their educational attainment or subsequent earnings or affect their family structure."  <br>  <br>  Hence, I would question the veracity of the "studies" typically released in regards to the "effects" of teenage pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I also have something to say to your other remarks, namely that adolescents are financially incapable of caring for children, and the insinuation that they are evidently incapable of making rational and informed decisions regarding their own lives and futures.<br>  <br>  Firstly, I shall address the financial issue. Your assertion that it is not in the long-term interests of adolescents to engage in teenage childbearing appears to be inaccurate, as evidenced by the empirical data that I have posted. Regardless, there is another critical facet that needs to be mentioned, the fact that adolescents are not PERMITTED to seek economic empowerment, as caused through the dual force of child labor and compulsory schooling laws, regardless of whether they'd actually have an interest in it. I'm aware that you apparently regard these establishments as positive benefits, perhaps believing that they protect vulnerable children from sweatshops or something si|`|xRUZkFU9aa	Honestly, it's just stupid society rules. There were a few answers that touched base...most people know that teen moms are not usually married and most of the time..need to resort to welfare...this is a burden to the young woman..and a burden to society..so yes, that's frowned upon. What some people don't realize, though, is that some teen moms are taking care of themselves and their babies..I guess it's natural for us to all be quick to judge. <br>  I have only seen a few responsible teen moms..the rest were ALL unmarried and on some type of gov't assistance..and I have little to no respect for that.

From what I've seen, younger women handle children better emotionally than older women do. It is more of a culture shock for an older woman. The woman that made the statement about young women being less mature nowadays... Disgusting, generalised, biased, judgemental and completely invalid comment, of which you should be ashamed. The fact is, nobody is ready to have a kid, until they do. The thing that shifts the scales in favour of older women in this argument is financial readiness, but the true bearing that wealth has on child raising is over emphasised in todays society. The thing that makes this argument the source of tension, is the presumptuous way in which older women pidgeon hole the younger generation, and further, the attitude that they have a right to exercise hypocrisy, having already made and learned from their own mistakes. Why don't you keep your judgements to yourself, bugger off and live your own lives.<br>  Having read a post from below, I will add that I know a lot of middle aged folks who don't own a house, or have a decent amount of cash flowing in, so you couldn't have said "in general" enough to justify your statements. I feel that "in general" older people are too far out of touch to be successful parents. They don't know how to relate to their children, and their children more easily become alienated from the older, more judgemental generation, are more prone to rebellion, drug abuse, underaged drinking, etc. But hey, thats just speaking in general, which is something we could do till the cows came home. You have no right to judge, you had your life to live, and would have been offended if someone like you are now, told you then how you should live, another example of how out of touch the older generation has become.<br>  Edit: To Cynical: Both my Grandmothers said "oops, I'm pregnant" and married after the fact.

6gtgiCS7aa	I'd give her another year ... at least until she can totally understand that it is not something you swallow. And start her on small pieces of gum, so in case she swallows it won't pose much of a choking hazard.|`|J2glFOkhaa	My son is almost 5 and I found out his grandparents gave him gum. I was livid. Until I found out it was sugar free and he doesn't swallow it, so I let up and let them give it to him. He knows it is only for chewing. I still don't like the idea, but I'm not 100% against it anymore|`|oiJITSNZaa	my son was three when he first had gum given to him. For awhile he did great, then he quick swallowed it if he thought he had to get rid of it. So no more gum till he grows up a little!
s0caxvrpaa	Im not a doctor or anything, but it sounds like stress to me. Trying for a baby can cause a lot of stress, which can, and often does effect your period. Not to mention losing your job! I often have irregular months, where I spot and such, but if I stop and think, it usually happens when I am feeling a lot of stress, or have been more physically active than normal. Do you think this could be your answer?<br>  Hope I helped..
O3EtP4vOaa	It could be either one.  I would strongly urge her to take a pregnancy test because continuing to take the pill while pregnant is bad for the baby.  With that being said the pill could also affect her periods and that could also cause the delay.|`|yNNdHDKvaa	Yes! This could be the case,...because of the pills would have a side affect, throwing her menstrual cycle off tract,..ooorr,...she could be pregnant.<br>  Is your girlfriend married? If not, then she couldn't be pregnant. You know what God says about premarital sex!? Why is she in a sexual relationship if she isn't married?|`|ATBHG0ztaa	The pill messes up your cycle a lot. I didn't get my period my first round of pills until 4 days into the sugar pills. <br>  <br>  If you really want to know, take a DIGITAL pregnancy test. They leave less room for not being able to tell whether it's posi or negi on your result.|`|XpDt1bqHaa	yes she could be pregnant. my daughter was using the pill and got pregnant. she didnt know it for a long time...it's better to know....
vACBeHSfaa	Can you expand on what your cervical mucus was doing?   The reason why I ask is because it is suspect to me that FF would identify ovulation with only 4 temperatures before ovulation, especially when they are targeting day 8 as ovulation day.  You can ovulate that early in a cycle, but it's not typical.  I would put just as much money on a day like day 14 or 18 being ovulation day.  Bottom line is that this is why the cervical mucus sign is so helpful.  If you had mucus on day 14, then I would put that day closer to ovulation.  Some women see another shift at implantation like the other poster said, this may be why there are a couple other rises on the chart.  I just find day 8 harder to believe as ovulation.  If you test negative on a home pregnancy test, don't give up as you may have ovulated later than FF is showing. <br>  <br>  And no, the zigzagging doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Sometimes our temps just do that!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!  hope this is your ++++++ cycle!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! well according to your chart it looks like you ovulated on CD 8. Usually, not always women with a 28 day cycle ovulate on day 14. So since you just dq the bc pill your cycles are probably a little bit off. Your chart DOES look ovulatory which is a good thing! Charts aren't the greatest tool to determine pregnancy b/c your BBT is high until menses. Some people who have a triphasic pattern, their chart can indicate pregnancy. But again I wouldn't go by your BBT chart to determine pregnancy. Def take a pregnancy test around your expected period date!!!!! And as a side note it can take up to 3 months for a women's cycle to regulate after dq the pill. So don't get down on yourself if it doesn't happen right away!!! Just have fun with ur hubby and enjoy ttc!!! When you make ttc a chore it isn't fun anymore! (trust me! it happend to me!!!) Anyways good luck and tons of baby dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3<3<3<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: and assuming that you did ovulate on CD 8 its 15 days past ovulation so you can go ahead and take a pregnancy test!!!!!!!!!! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
XCag7QRTaa	wtf do these pills mean lol
QKh7voVKaa	I had exactly the same thing except I described it as like a butterfly trapped in there. and i wasn't 'imagining' it. I felt her from 12 weeks, and I felt her move every single day after, she is really hyperactive now though, but she's so much fun. don't listen to people tell you it's not, you know what you feel, and it'll be even more clear as bub gets bigger, good luck and congratulations|`|1IDSGM71aa	It could definitely be your baby. I didn't think I was feeling my baby move that early (partly because I didn't know I was still pregnant), but once I found out I was still pregnant and started paying attention I realized it was her moving. I think that people who are more tuned into what's going on with their body will feel movement earlier.|`|RdprMxoUaa	That's exactly what my baby felt like, but I was a bit further along than you when I first felt it.  Everyone is different though, you are likely just very sensitive to the feeling. I had a friend that felt her baby around the same time as you. She had already had two kids so she knew the difference between gas and baby. I loved the feeling of life growing inside me. Enjoy it!|`|71426c90338c6daa00b5005f598c343aaa	The norm is to start feeling baby's movements between 16-18 weeks.  I felt my first at about 18, my second around 15 weeks and I've been feeling this one for a couple of day now, and I'm 15 weeks.<br>  <br>  It is a litle early, but the doctor told me it was too early for me to be feeling my second at 15 weeks, and yet when he did the ultrasound I kept telling im when baby moved, and he finally had to admit that it was baby's movements!<br>  <br>  Everyone is different, and especially if you are very thin or baby isn't your first, then yes, you can feel it earlier.  It certainly sound like movements from the way you describe it!<br>  <br>  Good luck xx<br>  <br>  *Mumy to Alex, almost 7, Encarni 1 and baby due 29 Aug*|`|hA8XL17Uaa	Wow im so jelous!  It certainly does sound like it is your little one and congrats hunny i bet it feels amazing to know that that is your baby moving inside you!!

This is my third so i know it is the baby and not anything else.|`|VPVg792eaa	different women feel there baby move at different times this feeling could be movement of your baby or could be movement of the fluid just enjoy it all and make the most of it <br>  Good luck hun all the best <br>  xx
UR9BX77haa	Until she was 14 months old and for my sanity as well as needing some extra cash I went back to work. <br>  Its only 24hrs a week but I want her to grow up knowing that women can have a career as well as a family and be a strong individual. <br>  <br>  I don't want stay at home mums to feel thats a put down because its not at all, its just that I want my girl to be a very strong feminista type who doesn't take crap from any man - what I'm really trying to say is I want my baby to stay under the protection of me forever but I know she can't so I want her to grow up able to take on anything life throws at her.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	I became a stay at home mom. My husband and I just felt better about having me stay home and raise her than we did about putting her in day care. We're on a tighter budget, but I really think that we made the right decision. I honestly miss my job sometimes though. Getting up and going to work even on no sleep was just easier. It was nice to get outside and drive to work, pick up my coffee, joke around with my co workers and feel like I was being productive. Being a SAHM is seriously the hardest thing I've ever done, and I've had some pretty demanding jobs. It's been lonely and I've had some cabin fever, I'm lucky if I get the chance to eat anything besides a granola bar and have time to take a bath, let alone get anything done around the house. But it's totally worth it knowing that I won't miss out on watching her grow up.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	I've already decided that I want to stay at home for the foreseeable future to look after my daughter, but I don't know if my fiance will let me yet :(<br>  <br>  My argument is that it costs loads to send kids to daycare, so it's best if I stay at home. <br>  <br>  I do love work (sometimes) but what could beat devoting all your time to making sure your kids are the best they can be? And what if I missed something important? And does someone else looking after your kids really invest as much time and effort into their development as a mother does?<br>  <br>  I'm dreading leaving my daughter to go get my hair cut tomorrow, so I doubt I'd cope going back to work!<br>  <br>  I have to say though, I am baffled and impressed as to how a working mum manages to go to work, and do all the stuff that I do everyday.

CRR3uJL9aa	you can stop boiling it now. As long as your bottles, and beakers are sterilised before you use you will be ok.|`|caM1Syyfaa	I guess it all depends on the quality of your tap water. They say water purified with charcoal is better than the one purified with chlorine. You should check with your local EPA how safe your tap water is. They also suggest a purifier depending of your findings. <br>  <br>  However, I wouldn't give tap water to a baby or a child or anyone. We drink still mineral water, we order lots of bottles online so that we don't need to carry them.<br>  <br>  And btw, I think it's great you are not giving him juice.|`|1enIWBGnaa	He's old enough to stop boiling liquids.

I figured she would be picking up germs from the floor anyway - unfortunately it is not possible to sterilise a carpet. However, if she gets sick, I boiled the water for her milk and sips of water. Now at 18m, I rarely boil. I keep cooled boiled water in the fridge, but she rarely takes chilled drinks - so its right out of the tap, or nothing.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	i stopped breast feeding at 9 months and went straight into using normal tap water and i never sterilised anything.

OJFz0LBZaa	babies can turn right up until you go in to labor, the same as if they are head down at 35weeks they can still turn and be breech|`|mx3gFmIKaa	At 36-37 weeks if the baby has not turned it is unlikely that he/she will.  At this time the doc starts preparing for scheduling the c-section.  They can turn up till the end, but 90 percent are in position at 36-37 weeks, once the baby drops turning isn't possible, though some people don't till the end|`|WPI0Z47saa	My friend was worried when at 39 weeks her baby was breech and the doctor was talking c-section with her (I had this and it is not big deal) anyway her baby turned at the last minute with a little help from the doctor. Sometimes they can manupliate them into the right position.  But a baby can turn at any time so don't worry yet. Most will turn on their own by the time they are ready. Good luck.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My mom went into labor with my sister and the doc realized she had flipped into a breech position.

WPI0Z47saa	You are lucky that your son still naps at 3. Mine stopped right before he was 2. I breastfed him until he was 18 months so I been there also. When I put him in a toddler bed when he was almost 3 (he is 3 1/2 now) he wouldn't stay in bed. I had to take everything out of his room except his bed and dresser. I also stood in the hallway for awhile and if I heard him get up I would go in and tell him that if he got up again I would take something away from him (this depended on what he was most interested in at the time). He would get upset and sometimes I did this several times a night but he finally got it. I also put him to bed at the same time each night. He used to stay up late but once he stopped napping I made him go to bed at 8pm sharp. He sleeps 10-11 hours now. You just have to find a routine that works for your kids and do not change it for any reason. You can also reward him for staying in bed. I used to say things like if you stay in bed all night and not get up once then we can go to the playground tomorrow. Rewards almost always ark for him if it is something that he really likes. As for your daughter, when he was young and especially when I nursed him also he would want me to stay with him or fight me when I was leaving and cry alot. I used to do the same as you and give n so that my husband didn't wake up either. His pediatrician told me that I had to let him cry but on a schedule. He said to break in into 5 nights. The first night if she cries you can go in the room and rock her in the chair for 5 minutes (no longer) then put her back in the crib. You tell her as you are leaving the room that it is night time and she has to go to sleep. You can do this up to 5 times then you have to let her cry it out that night if she still is. The second night once you put her in the crib you DO NOT take her out. You can talk to her, rub her back, hug her, but do not pick her up. Say the same thing that it is nght time and time to go to sleep and leave the room. Do this up to 5 times and then let it go. The third night once she is in the crib do not go over to the crib at all. Talk to her from across the room but no contact with her. Give the same night speech and leave. Same thing with repeating this. The fourth night you only talk to her from the doorway. Do not go totally into the room. Give speech and leave. The 5th night once you leave the room you stay out. Tell her from the hallway with the door closed that it is time to sleep, I love you, goodnight. I thought that this sounded crazy and a little mean but it worked. I was so relieved and glad that I tried it. It is just getting them used to the rules and the schedule. I really hop this helps. Sorry that this is so long. I felt for you because I have been there also and I know it makes you want to pull your hair out. Good luck.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Well, cut out the 3 year olds nap first off. He is getting 2 hours right there. He'll go down at 7:30 if he gets up at 7:30 and no naps. As for the baby, she is one now and you will have to try gentle cry it out. What I did was lay down on the bed with my baby's crib in the room. Close your eyes and let her see your face. Dim the lights and play soft music. She will holler and every 20 mins, you open your eyes and say "Mommy's here, shhh, shhh" and the close them. I did this for a week with my co-sleeper nurser and now she sleeps like a champ.<br>  Don't pick her up and yes, it will fry your nerves but she won't feel like she is being abandoned or anything. As hard as it is now - you did a great thing by always being there for your infant - the psychological and emotional nurturing you have given her is worth this rough patch.|`|8khZ0fJZaa	Maybe when they get up around 3 pm, try not letting them sit around. Make a game up that involves both of them that makes them active and tired. Make sure it is a game they can do together if you get tired quickly. Then let them eat around 6 pm. Then tell them go play some more. At 7 or 8 give them a bath and let them settle down and watch a movie. Leave the room and let them fall asleep. Just peek in the door to check on them every once in a while. <br>  Good luck. (This is the plan I am going to use on my son as well.)|`|AA11212578	OK<br>  <br>  First thing,  3 year olds is about the time kids (or some kids) stop taking naps.  My son stopped taking naps around 3 and has no problem making it through the day and goes to bed around 8:30PM.   My daughter (who is 3.5) can go w/o a nap but is cranky in the evening (or worse, taking a nap from 5-7PM) if she doesn't.    She usually end up making her take a nap (or at least stay in her bed) for about 1-3 hours a day.<br>  <br>  As far as the 1 year old goes,  bottom line is that she needs to learn to fall asleep by herself.    I know it feels cruel to let her "cry out" but in reality she will need to do that in one form or another.    Check up on her at night but I wouldn't stay in the room for more than a couple of minutes.  Don't pick her up (everybody tells you this for a reason because they learned the hard way).  Of course this wouldn't apply if she was sick or something but she needs to learn to fall asleep by herself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck...|`|VkM13OmEaa	I know that you find it difficult to let your child cry, but you will have to be the strong one if you want the best for them. All children waken the same number of times per night. The difference between a good sleeper and a bad sleeper is that one can put themselves back to sleep and the other needs adult help to do so. Your job is to raise an independent child with the skills to be healthy (including successful sleep). For this reason you have to overcome your problem with hearing your child cry. It generally only takes a few nights of crying to educate your child into a healthy sleep pattern. I know this is true, because I have managed it with my three children, who are 7, 5 and 3. They have all slept all night since they were about 3 months old.|`|igWCojTbaa	Wow Kayla,<br>  You could have just described our house! <br>  My DD4 needs a nap, but then she won't go to sleep of a night... OR she doesn't have a nap and goes to bed at a reasonable hour(about 8.30) only to get up at midnight to play and talk and sing and read stories... going to sleep again at 4am!!  <br>  I also have a nearly 1 year old who I put to sleep by rocking..then put in the cot... then he wakes up...i rock him back to sleep...walk away...he wakes up!!! he tends to sleep his best in the cot after midnight!<br>  Have you noticed if it's any different depending on what shifts your husband is doing? (if they vary)<br>  Have you tried geting them up early and then giving them an early nap ?
caM1Syyfaa	My lactation consultant said it is the frequency of expressing rather than the lenght that helps stimulate the production of milk, so use the pump at one breast as long as there is milk flowing, then go to the other breast and then try to do this frequently (every two hours).<br>  <br>  Don't drink more water than you think you want to drink, as this can actually reduce the quantity of milk you are producing. But also don't forget to drink when you feel thirsty. Eat healthily, it's very important for the quality of your milk that your nutrition is right.<br>  <br>  Contact your La Leche League for advice about everything, incl. how to get the baby to latch on. It's free.<br>  <br>  I really admire your strenght and determination and I am positive you will find the right solution for your little one and yourself! Good luck!|`|OyBuEpOTaa	sleep when she sleeps. is she suckling now or do you still have to express milk? Drink lots of water. Also, contact the La Leche League. Find them online. they have lots of knowledge and resources.|`|jvFWNuiXaa	I had read in one of the answers here that a mother tried the latch after  expressing for some time and was succesful. Maybe with the help of a lactation consultant u can try it too. I know how painful it is to see the baby not being able to latch on and get frustrated. Believe me I have been there. My baby is 8 weeks old and I still have sore nipples, and low supply issues. Good for u for giving her milk for that amount of time. Just think of your daughter, and try not to get stressed, it hurts your supply.

vOFdHvlvaa	The earliest my pediatrician says to introduce rice cereal is 4 months old (but only if baby is ready, basically if they seem interested in ur food and/or are able to sit up well on there own or with support).  And the earliest fruits and veggies should be introduced is 6 months, and my pediatrician says that it's better to start veggies first cuz they are blander and so therefore easier for babies to get used to and because sometimes babies who get fruits first will reject veggies (since fruits are sweeter).<br>  I started my son on rice cereal at 4 months old, veggies at 6 months old and fruits at 6/1/2 months old.<br>  For first rice cereal feeding, only give about 1 or 2 spoonfuls to stat out with (back of rice cereal box will tell u how to make it for babies first feeding), and then from there u can slowly increase the amount and get it less liquidy as he gets used to eatin it, and u can increase it to 2 times a day instead of once also once he is used to it, just remember to start out slowly.<br>  As for the veggies and fruits: Start by givin a spoonful or 2 of that the first time, and only give them one kind at a time (and wait at least 3 or 4 days in between to look for allergic reactions).  U can then slowly increase the amount as they get used to it, just like with the rice cereal and u can stat givin it more than once a day also once he is used to it.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Ask your pediatrician this question. They will know what is best for your baby. Usually you start rice cereal at about 4 months then baby food at around 6 months. They need to be able to sit up on their own before you start feeding them anything for fear of choking. Ask your dr though. That's what they went to years and years of school for.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	Your doc will tell you what is best for your baby but average is around 6 months.|`|SIK58haraa	usually 4 months is the youngest to start cereal. The fruit can hurt there bellies wait a while to give them that.|`|h90Uobyyaa	I was advised to start at 4 months. My son wasnt satisfied enough with breastmilk and i didnt want to use formula so he had baby cereal at 3m3w and then i gave him banana and then mashed veg etc. By four months he was having avocardo, blueberries, pear, apple, brocoli, couliflower, pumpkin, potato, sweet potato, carrot, peas etc etc he eats ALOT. lol<br>  <br>  edit: <br>  they say to introduce one food at a time but i found this was blocking him up so i just mixed them together- we have no history of allergic reactions to anything on either side of the family and i only stuck to the low allergy foods.|`|azrKKNfTaa	i was told that to keep my daughter only on breast milk for 6 months then start wth cereals ect.|`|KICQQxLxaa	You have about 3 more months!!<br>  <br>  Current research and wisdom say to wait until babies are 6 months old.  He doesn't need anything else but his breastfeeds at this point.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	When he is 6 months old you can start by introducing rice cereal.  Once he is good with that, then you can go on to veggies, introducing 1 at a time.  Then you move on to fruits.
vhMe2oCGaa	im a mum of three and im 21 i had my first a fifteen. like you my partner who is now my husband was extremely supportive and we talked it over and over having him there when i told my parent was extremly important and he gave me the courage to be able to do it . you definately have to do it in person no leter or phone call it definately has to be in person. and do it together it makes it easier .<br>  <br>  as for college i found that it wasnt all that hard for me to finish highschool and then college. my husband was eighteen at the time and he put off going to college to look after our daughter so i could finish highschool. i did half my classes at school and half by corrospondence so i spent half the day at school and thn went home and my husband went to work it took a bit of juggling .but  six years later we have both finished college and have good careers our own home and a perfect little family.it took me a while because off all the comments and disrespect i had recieved for being a young mum. but i am finally not afraid to tell people im a young mother i am incredibly proud off what we have acomplished <br>  <br>  i think that your age wont matter its your ability to love care and look after the child . they are the most important thing in the entire situation <br>  also be prepared for people not to accept your descion i personally think that for me having my children young was the best thing ive done. also dont pay too much attention to books and manuals your intution kicks in a your body tells you what you need and what to do <br>  <br>  if your parent support you it will be a lot easier but if not...to bad for them you have the support of your partner and in nine month you'll have the most amazing thing you will ever see<br>  good luck you can email any time about any thing if ya need or want<br>  and i hope i helped a bit =) <br>  x<br>  your not a baby your eighteen and you have every oppurtunity to be and awsome mother !!!!! <br>  my parents werent the most supportive but my husbands parents were awesome and my mother in law told me when we first told them that we must never look at our daughter as a mistake or a mishap but a miracle . ive always rememberd that i think so true reguardlss of the situstion and what everyone else think a baby is a miracle!!! just remember that .|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	at 18, your concidered an adult and i personally think thats a fine age for having a baby. BUT, it will put a BIG stress on your schooling. you will need lots of support and help. i would speak with your mother and see how she feels. if your going to be living at home this will include her for the time being and a baby changes your life totally. just remember, your mother was young once... :) good luck!|`|OLvNK5FOaa	well yeh, 18 is a young age, but you don't expect these things to happen; it happens.

Yes, you are very young but if you put in the time and effort to raise a child you should have no problem. As for telling your parents....dont tell them it was a mistake, because that makes itsound so  much worse, just tell them how you feel abou having a kid and make sure they support your decisions as well...good luck i am sure you will be a great mother|`|wykzDsZ1aa	first ask your boy friend, is he ready to hold your hand, i.e., is he ready to marry you BECAUSE one should not think for near future. I mean today he is supportive, what about tomorrow. <br>  <br>  Don't mind, if you guys have break-up tomorrow, what about the future of that child. Who will give the father's name to him or her. Apparently, at that stage who would marry you. <br>  <br>  Moreover, think about your parents, they will have a curse when society will tont them.<br>  <br>  If he agrees, than you can manage and can go hand in hand with your studies as well as your child but you dont have any right to play with the future of someone (child) just because you wanted to be called "mom".<br>  <br>  Once you are confirmed with the thing that his future is secure as in he don't have to face the society, you can plan up other things like telling your mom, because when you will tell them about it, they will be shocked but they would also be satisfied when they are confirmed that someone is there to take the responsibility or your BF is so responsible that he is there to take care of both of you.<br>  <br>  May be i am wrong, So do rate ma answer so that i can ascertain myself.|`|yxtMLgN8aa	Well, life is definitely going to change, obviously. If you can afford it, consider getting your own place with your boyfriend. It will by nice having your own place with a kid. I don't know your mom, but she might enjoy having her space too, but will love for you to come visit with her grandbaby every now and then.<br>  <br>  As for me, I'm turning 22 at the end of the month and I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years. I'm 22w4d pregnant today. We have been living together for a year now. I was a little nervous to tell my mom, but it's not something you can hide. I told her by buying a pair of plain white baby shoes and wrote July on one shoe and 2009 on the other (baby's due date/month). I put each shoe in it's own tiny bag. I gave one bag to my mom, and the other to my step-dad. And as for telling my dad, who lives in Cali and I'm in Texas, I'm telling him by sending him a baby shower invitation. That's all he gets. So I haven't even told him yet and I'm more than halfway pregnant. But that's all I feel he deserves. He's not much in my life since he and my mom split.<br>  <br>  ************Added info:**************<br>  Some people will tell you you should get married because you are pregnant i.e. the person underneath me, I think that's totally up to you. Just becasue you are not married does not mean the father of the baby is going to leave you and just because someone is married doesn't mean the father will stay. Hello, my parents were married and now they are not. I'm not in a rush to get married. That doesn't  mean my baby has no father.|`|cl1N5WYCaa	18 isn't too young and there is stability since you've been with one guy for three years. I'm sure your mom will understand.  It's always good to try and develop a plan before you tell her though. That way she knows you have really put a lot of thought into this and that you are trying to make sure you and your baby's future are stable.|`|0n1UktnJaa	You will get a lot of answers that 18 is too young, but in all reality, let's say about 50 years ago, women were having children as soon as they were married off at 18, hundreds of years ago, women were married earlier than 18 and having children earlier than that.  So physically speaking, no hon, you are not too young to have a child and if you and your boyfriend are up to it and if he is a man and is going to stick up to the responsibility and I am not going to lie, it IS A BIG responsibility, then, be happy and have your child with lots of love and hopefully the support of your family.  Now, the bad news. The economy is shot right now, money is going to be tight and with you going to school, paying for child care and the upbringing of a child is major hard right now.  There are lots of good programs out there, WIC, FAFSA, right now my minds throwing a blank on the others, but there are plenty more. Telling your mom right now is going to be hard, but you are now an adult and soon to be a mom/parent, so buck up and be an adult and have that adult conversation with her and be truthful and let her know what is going on point blank.  As for going to school, keep going and don't give up, because in the long run, the schooling is going to help your future career and there are plenty of wonder women out there who have jobs and families going on at the same time, you are just starting yours a little early.<br>  Good luck to you.<br>  Congrats.<br>  MJ|`|1kuJ8423aa	It will be ok, everything will workout. I found out I was preg when i was 18 and in my first semester of college. It may take you a little longer to finish school but it can be done. All you have is time anyway after high school to live your life. Now I am 26 and have 2 degrees and everything is fine and I'm raising my son by myself. Just don't worry about what other people think. It was hard to tell my mom but she was happy and supported me as long as I took care of my child and stayed in college. Im not saying it was so easy but it can be done if you have faith. <br>  <br>  Best to tell mom in person face to face not over the phone or email! My brother left a voice mail when he told my mom he was having a son and that came up in a argument.|`|PvAp83TWaa	Alright not to be judging you on anything.<br>  <br>  But you need to be aware of facts alright?<br>  <br>  It is totally up to you if want to keep the baby or not. Now it seems to me that you are afraid of letting your mother find out. Now here are a few things to consider before telling your mother.<br>  <br>  Reflect, and ask yourself these questions<br>  - Why do you want to have the baby?<br>  - Will your boyfriend be a good husband, better yet a father?<br>  - With your age, and your dreams, will you be a good mother?<br>  - What obstacles will you face if you keep the baby? What obstacles might you have if you abort the baby?<br>  <br>  Ever wonder why people would take it as a waste when teens get pregnant? It is usually because most teens like us, would still change our attitudes, change our preferences, change our likes and dislikes.<br>  <br>  Whatever is important to you right now, might not be a priority to you over the years. Now this is important because every and i mean EVERY decision you will be making from now on will  affect you, your boyfriend, your mother and your baby.<br>  <br>  So anyway, I apologize if this would make you feel guilty, but I'd have to let you be aware on this, for this is a fact.<br>  <br>  So my advice regarding this, would be to better identify your strengths and weaknesses. If possible all those. Have time to know yourself more. Your boyfriend as well.<br>  <br>  You've got more than 7 months to do this ;)|`|dbyJhlruaa	For me 18 is still young to get pregnant. Its good to know that your boyfriend is very much supportive. It only indicates that he really loves you. If only possible talk to your mother with your boyfriend besides you for support in case. Now if your mother get mad to both of you or what so ever just take it positively because for me its a normal reaction of a mother at first and time comes in for acceptance. Tell your mother about your plans and consider your mothers plan too. Dont forget that mothers knows best. Always remember that what you have done is not a mistake it only reminds us how wonderful life is.<br>  Dont be afraid!|`|wNtW1hXLaa	Being a mum is a wonderful experience. it is an enormous responsibility and a lot of hard work. it is the biggest challenge of your life. you are very young but if you realise how hard it is going to be and think that you are capable and have the money and support to provide for the baby then you could make it work for you. You will definitely need the love, help and support of your mum so you need to share this information with her and begin the discussions and decision making process. Remember , it is your decision. Good luck!! p.s. my sister in law is 20 and fell pregnant in November unexpectedly. She married her boyfriend  in December and they decided to have the baby and we are all supporting them. It was a shock at first but they are both really happy.|`|nKwcGLQraa	well, if you do have the kid then you have to be ready to say good-bye to your social life and future. I mean, having a baby and trying to study at the same at college is almost impossible. It will wear you out so much and you will hardly have the enrgy to study or do good in school inbetween takign care of your baby.<br>  I would say you ait untill graduating untill you have a baby. Seriously, you have all life to get a family. no need ot rush it. People always say that college is the best part of your life with all the fun and parties adn friends, so dont throw it away by having a baby.<br>  <br>  think about it.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I think 18 is VERY young to have a kid, especially if you're just starting college.  But don't worry.  It isn't impossible to finish college and have a kid at the same time.  A child is not a handicap, especially if you have the support of the father and your family.<br>  <br>  I suggest you take a deep breath and sit her down and let her know.  Let her know you didn't plan it, but now that it's happened, you plan on seeing it through.  <br>  <br>  Good luck! ^-^ *hugs*
yziXww8Kaa	If you look online you'll find a general list of what to pack.

I did pack extra socks there were like four pairs in there. Plus if you want to use the hospitals soaps and shampoos they have that or you can pack your owns.  I delivered my first child in the winter so I get sensitive skin in the winter so I packed small bottles of all my own stuff.<br>  <br>  Also for my labor bag not stay bag I had snacks in for my hubby and change for the vending machines and if he wanted to get some food or something.  Then I had cards and books like word search and all that stuff.  <br>  <br>  For my next son I am going to pack games and a movie or something to keep my mind off the pain.  Like games for two or more people with a board because that I know would have helped me a lot more.  <br>  <br>  ALSO don't forget your phone call list of people to call and let know once you have baby or go into labor.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!! Congrats!<br>  <br>  Oh gosh and I packed like 4 pairs of fresh undies... they supplied like these diaper things for the first day after you had the baby big panties with diapers and ice in them at my hospital.   But I had some larger undies just for birth because you wear those pads and there big and I didn't want to ruin any of my undies.<br>  <br>  Oh and if you don't want to use the hospitals pillows and blankets bring your own.  And have hubby or partner bring a bag for there selves.  Or you can pack for them.  I threw and extra pair of sweats and jeans for hubby and when he ran home and got a shower he got clothes and changed himself. <br>  <br>  =] Hope I helped.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	To be honest i think its kind of pointless i brought everything deoderant shampoo toothpaste and brush pads things of that sort and the hospital gave me all that...and i only used my bathrob and stood in my jonnie because i had a csection and it was just more comfortable. just bring some underpants and an outfit for when u leave and a sports bras and a bathrob. and clothes for the baby.|`|SwoRqEZvaa	honestly all my firs 2 baby I was in so much pain i forgot the damn bag. for my 3rd i brought clothes for both of us, a and a blanket. my hubby brought anything else i needed|`|AA10465123	comfortable underwear!!!!; body lotion; warm socks; flip flops to shower in; toiletries; books; music; reemember a jacket; i forgot mine and it was cold when i left; clothes for the baby; bring your certificates if it requires babys hand prints( i had one for my baby that needed her hand and feet prints, and the nurses were ok about getting those prints on the certificate); snacks that you like; phone charger; button front night gown;|`|6gtgiCS7aa	I've never done this properly, but off the top of my head I'd suggest: <br>  <br>  overnight sanitary pads (or maternity pads)<br>  your nighties<br>  bedslippers<br>  toiletries you can't live without (deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, lotion)<br>  diapers<br>  washcloths for you and baby<br>  some things to dress the baby in<br>  hats, socks for baby<br>  <br>  mp3 player (if you have one)<br>  books to read (?)<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best!|`|V8wUAVdyaa	the hospital should provide everything except an outfit for coming home and the car seat for the baby.  Bring a couple changes of clothes, maybe an ipod, some soap and shampoo, comfortable pads because theirs are HUGE and some quarters for daddy to make trips to the vending machines.  Congrats!
JbC50Xiqaa	At 16 weeks, I started feeling bubble like feeling. I just thought it was gas. Then when I was 17 weeks, I started feeling a tapping like sensation. It didn't feel like gas and I knew it was the baby. Now I'm 19 weeks, I actually feel kicks and turns and twists. It's very wonderful! I think I feel it so strongly because I'm sooo small! I'm barely showing yet.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll feel yours soon ;) It will feel very different from gas!|`|8c4kRTnPaa	I started to feel my baby flutters at 14 weeks, I am now 16 weeks and I feel it more often|`|KIZVWREHaa	between 12-14 weeks along . I would recommend the book planning your pregnancy and birth . This answers most questions all women have . You can get it really cheap on ebay . Congrats and good luck .|`|kw80YHMLaa	i was 12 weeks with my first i have just found out im pregnant again so i will see this time round as it depends on whether it's your first second or so pregnancy
GNLYxY7kaa	i am like you also, my son gets very cranky and fights going to sleep. i also feel bad letting him cry. i tried that 2 days and said screw this i dont want him to be upset. so what i do is get a warm bottle, lay him in bed next to me and let him relax and slowly drink his bottle. he is out in minutes! i dont know if its spoiling him and it IS exhausting for me...but hey, it works and i feel ok doing it.|`|6XpYk69Gaa	Plenty of parents have been in the same position, including me!<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is something I'm sure you've tried, but let me reiterate: lay your baby down when he's just getting tired. If he cries (which mine does too!) check on him every 5-10 minutes or so. Rub his back, talk to him soothingly, but don't pick him up. Eventually, he'll fall asleep.<br>  <br>  They cry because they're cranky (as you've noticed) and overtired. They can't vocalize it, so they cry. <br>  <br>  I know you can feel guilty, but in the end it will be worth it. I know how you're feeling, I did the same with my daughter who's 10 months old. It took roughly a week or so, and then she got the message that when she went down for a nap in her crib, she was sleeping.<br>  <br>  Also, try not to put your son in his crib unless it's to sleep. That send the message that crib=sleep.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Dont let him get to the point where hes so overtired hes that cranky. Watch for the signs like rubbing eyes, starting off into space and yawning.|`|KICQQxLxaa	It seems like you are putting him down to sleep when he is over-tired.  Try catching his *sleepy signs* and put him down then.<br>  <br>  I don't think it is OK to leave him screaming and crying in his bed by himself.  I think it is mean.<br>  Of course you feel guilty, because in your heart you know it isn't right to leave him alone to scream and cry.<br>  <br>  You are not spoiling him by being there for him...|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I also have a 9 month old, and, speaking from experience, it is much better to rock him to sleep when he is at that point. Sometimes my son will fight sleep even when I am rocking him, but it goes a lot faster and involves a lot less tears when I help him out. Babies are unable to regulate their emotions, especially when tired. So, even though they may need to sleep and be very tired, they do need help getting there. It will NOT make him spoiled, don't worry. Best of luck & take care!
oiJITSNZaa	My baby girl loved peas and carrots but I could not get her to eat green beans....baby food. Well I finally cracked down and fed her only green beans and after a few battles she ate them as well as peas. It sure was worth it for later in life because now at 1 1/2 she loves all her veggies!|`|kprKXEOSaa	I believe most doctors recommend waiting to start babies on solid foods until about 6 months, and that would be rice cereal, and then the basic fruits and vegetables.  If your baby is 6 months and already on stage 2, you jumped the gun a little.<br>  There is no reason he needs to eat his "greens."  Breast milk supplemented with a little food is just fine.  Don't rush it, what's the rush?  Some kids never like peas and beans, anyway.  You can't force someone to like something, and you can't force someone to eat something.  They spit it out, they learn to vomit.  Don't force it.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	keep offering, and offer them FIRST, before anything else. <br>  <br>  (what's with the vitamins? is he deficient or something? i BF too & never heard of that...)|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Have you tried cooking your own veg and offering him that? I'm just asking because my daughter hated veg in baby jars, but likes it when I have cooked my own.<br>  She hated veg at 6 months, she wasn't ready but decided she liked it once she got to 9 months.  It can take many attempts to get a baby to like new tastes. Persevere.|`|kziIf0r6aa	Mash them up and put them in his mashed potato, otherwise maybe try putting some gravy of white sauce on them.  He may not be a bean eater simple as that.  I know my little on who is 22 months once upon a time loved his peas and corn now wont even touch them.  Its weetbix this week then porridge the next for dinner.  They are just exploring their little pallets.  They may even feel funny on his tounge better off mashed or pureed
AA11659150	Agree with the gal above.  Mine was 104.  They want you below 140 for the glucose screening.  Did you follow the rules exactly before you took the test?  <br>  <br>  The 3 tier screen will show for sure, but even if you are gest. diabetic, it almost always goes away pretty much instantly after delivery.  And they may not try meds yet, it may just require a change in your diet.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, that is too high.  Normal is 80-120, medication is given for diabetes at 150 for pregnant women, this is a borderline result and will get you a repeat glucose tolerance test (3 hour), at 300 you are hospitalized.  <br>  <br>  They will retest you, and get you started on some meds<br>  <br>  since you are pregnant its gestational diabetes.  This is different than Insulin dependent diabetes, its more of a intolerance to carbs.  After pregnancy if you lose the weight in a timely fashion (more than 75 percent in 1 year) then you most likely won't have diabetes and will no longer take meds<br>  <br>  At that high, I guarantee you will be going to insulin shots daily, you will have a monitor for blood sugar and take readings around meal times|`|VzLkSZ4faa	A fasting blood sugar should be around 90 mg/mL a nonfasting should be around 120 mg/mL at the highest. You need to go get retested and watch what you are eating.|`|e33QAXShaa	80-120 is average so that is pretty high.
ecbe0658102674f8ad91e0162ac2a91faa	You must be fertile at the middle time between your periods.<br>  If it is about 28 days, much probably you'll notice few days around the 14th day (starting to count from the first day of your period; around the 15th of March) - you'll notice one or a couple of days before & after the 15th of March, that you shall be WET :)<br>  Then is the time when your organism is prepared; it is in your ovulation time.<br>  <br>  It is also known that the gamete in the sperm of the man (XY), which gives the sex of the fetus, the X chromosome (will determine a female offspring, a XX), or the Y chromosome (whill determine the male offspring, a XY) together with the XX chromosome of the female ovule.<br>  Due to this, & also knowing that the Y are more sensible, they die in short, within a day, but the Xs are much more resistent till few days, IF you have sex in the first days, even before the ovulating period it is much possible for a feminine sex of the child. For a male offspring, wait for the signs (you may measure the basic temperature, in the vagina also, I heard), and you may have much chances for a boy - though it is not for sure! It's just a bigger chance.|`|9d150f0cca3e0dd6252664685c2425afaa	Ovulation should occur around the 14th March. So from 12th - 16th you are most fertile. Hope this helps.|`|SqzoZe4Laa	I'm not sure, but I can tell you that I have impregnated two girls, and both of them became impregnated when my uh, "you know what" was AS FAR UP INSIDE AS I COULD GET IT, when I "relieved myself", and I just kind of held it there. I really think there is SOMETHING TO THIS. When he is ready to ejaculate, grab him and hold up in you as far as possible the WHOLE TIME. (what.. 12 seconds), hold it in, the slowly let it out. Thats how it worked for us. But be ovulating, will ya? or you're wasting time but practicing technique.  -john in iowa|`|6chavwomaa	The best days to conceive would be from the 13th of march to the 17th of march that's round about when you ovulate
kVBDpAMTaa	Yes. That is very common. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it can last the whole 9 months too. I am almost 7 months and still having that problem occasionally. <br>  <br>  The only thing you can to is drink plenty of water, and eat more fiber rich foods. My doctor wouldn't put me on anything for it. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are taking prenatal vitamins that can make it worse. It is the iron in prenatal vitamins that causes constipation. So you could look for a prenatal vitamin without iron and just take iron caplets separately every other day or every couple days.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yeah i had it, could never get rid of it, i think drinking water helps|`|XhIYAH6Laa	Oh yes, I have had it since basically when I got a positive..lol You can try drinking more water. prune juice, or colace (safe during pregnancy). Also they say slight exercise helps as well! Congrats on the pregnancy!|`|tGgLhOIGaa	Yup im 5 weeks and also have constipation! its not good <br>  Drink water and fruit juice and eat more wholegrain this should help with the constipation<br>  good luck and have a healthy 8 more months<br>  <3|`|VPVg792eaa	Yes it is very common to get constipation early in pregnancy i had it with both my children honestly its nothing to worry about try drinking fresh juice but not to much as they are high in vitamin C|`|xgNujXsuaa	I have not had it but Rhubarb is very good for digestive transit.|`|gRWzLHVEaa	I don't recall having it in early pregnancy but it will only get worst as your pregnancy progresses and your uterus begins to squish all your organs. Metamucil is great to get you going but if you aren't drinking enough water you will still not be able to go, water is so important in flushing the toxins out, pregnant or not. Also do not take stool softeners or laxatives unless your doctor tells you it is safe to do so, most are not ok to take in pregnancy or not enough research has been done to deem them safe.<br>  The best bet is to just change your diet. Remember the baby eats what you eat. Fresh fruits and veggies are important, blackberries and apples are yummy sources of fiber. You could also try adding flax seeds or flax seed oil to your diet. Do not take castor oil!! And don't forget to drink lots of water!|`|p11HaDIWaa	lol this happened to me with both my pregnancies as soon as i found out i was pregnant with my daughter i got super constipated but always felt like i had to poop but nothing would come out ( i know its gross but its the truth) and i got a terrible flu that came out of no where, no one in my family or job was even sick. but the constipation thing stopped at around 4 months and with this pregnancy is was the same exact thing all over again...i guess its a pregnancy thing and apparently it happens to everyone, one of the many pregnancy symptoms...just wait until u start tinkling when u sneeze lol good luck to u and enjoy ur pregnancy:)|`|NCcpjBL5aa	I dont ever remember being constipated with any of my previous pregnancies, but i am with this one. When i first fell pregnant i could go twice if not three times a day. However, i have now been constipated for the last two days. I dont even have the sensation to go, which is alien to me!|`|uCU94ryQaa	Yes it's common throughout pregnancy. Try drinking fruit juice !

I've never had the need for any accessories. If it makes you feel more comfortable, they do make products that either attach to the side of your bed or you can put in bed with you.  Just make sure there are no heavy/bulky blankets or pillows near baby. I put my son in the middle of the bed so I'm on one side and my husband is on the other.  This works as long as neither of you rolls around a lot.  Also, once baby is a bit more mobile, <br>  I'd get a bed rail so baby can't roll out.
AvmKTcJNaa	You would be almost 5 months by now. Depending on your weight it should be visible. I doubt your pregnant but i wouldn't say definitely; there are always exceptions. About the missed periods... lets just say I have one now and my last one was in November (this is a normal thing for me). My son's test didn't show I was pregnant until I was 3 months and as for symptoms... well, it really depends on you BC but most have no definite proof of birth defects. Just stop worrying; It only makes things worse. Believe me, you'll be fine.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	you are not pregnant, you would been about 5months, my last period was november, and im 17 weeks now|`|W0AK2Lumaa	Yep|`|OJFz0LBZaa	i would say its safe to say they are not pregnant and would be around 4 and half months pregnant if they was, symptoms are different in every pregnancy, but could be morning sickness, sore/enlarged breast needing to wee more often, constipation heartburn putting on weight, tired more often to name a few|`|eth48m7Iaa	you are definitly not pregnant then, you would know because you would have physical changes, I think your stomach would have grown a lot by now! you would be 6 months along.|`|WVNMnvXLaa	monkeys taste like chicken|`|xprwl2Cpaa	Surely the chances using Clearblue digital twice and having your blood tested at the doctors all showing negative results falsely would be incredibly slim!
ybexjS2Paa	I found this <br>        1. Visualizing the baby moving down with the head very deep in your pelvis, several times a day; especially in conjunction with positions and exercises below.<br>  <br>        2. Swimming as often as possible. This keeps your body and pelvis loose and relaxed. Do in conjunction with headstand below if you have help.<br>  <br>        3. Headstand - with assistance and in a pool frequently as possible.<br>  <br>        4. Breech Tilt - begin at 32-35 weeks gestation. Do 3 times daily for 10-15 minutes each time, when you have an empty stomach, and the baby is active. Prop one end of an ironing board securely on a sofa or chair 12 to 18 inches high (or may use slant board). Lie down, bend knees but keep feet flat on board. Relax, breathe deeply, avoid tensing. May also use pillows on a flat surface to raise hips 12-18" above shoulders. Gravity pushes the baby's head into the fundus, tucks it, and baby can then do a somersault to a vertex position.<br>  <br>        5. CD/iPod headphones - place them inside mom's pants toward her pubic bone and play classical music for 10 minutes 6-8 times a day. <br>  <br>        6. Flashlight - try moving slowly down from the top of the uterus toward your pubic bone while you are in a breech tilt position.<br>  <br>        7. Massage - start with your left hand at the bottom of the abdomen and your right hand just above it. Move move your hands clockwise around the right side of your tummy. As your right hand reaches the top of your abdomen, slide the left one over your right and move it down the left side of your tummy. Your left hand leads as you you come full circle, continuing clockwise. Massage gently as you would to apply lotion. Massage for ten minutes or more up to several times each day. <br>  <br>        8. Clothespin - place on the small toe of each foot at the outside corner of the toenail; sideways so that the toenail and toepad are stimulated for 30 minutes per day, this is an acupressure point that is a "moving down" point. You can also do this with just finger pressure as you remember to do it.<br>  <br>        9. Motion Sickness band - place with the bead four fingerwidths above the inner ankle bone - another acupressure point that is used for stimulation of the uterus. Do not use this point if you are experiencing any pre-term labor.<br>  <br>        10. Glass of orange or other juice - follow this with a side-lying position with your hips positioned higher than your feet. Babies move more after a sugar high!<br>  <br>        11. Pelvic Tilt- with an ice pack on the top of your tummy on an empty stomach, 10 minutes twice a day. Do this while lying on your back on the floor with knees flexed and feet on the floor with three large pillows placed under your buttocks. Try this in conjunction with headphones and visualization.<br>  <br>        12. Cat stretch - start with all fours, then lay your head and chest flat on the floor with your buttocks in the air, as you round your back and return to all fours.<br>  <br>        13. Knee-chest position - by kneeling with hips flexed slightly more than 90 degree, but with thighs not pressing against your tummy and your head, shoulders and upper chest are flat on a mattress for 15 minutes every two waking hours for five days. <br>  <br>        14. Belly Relaxing followed by Inversion - Partner places a shawl, sheet, towel or rebozo under mom's hips as she lays on the floor. Lift up on the corners of the cloth and shimmy her from side to side moving your hands up and down to wiggle her belly from side to side. These should be very small movements which mom should find very relaxing. Do this for about 5 minutes. Then mother kneels on the stairway landing. Walk your hands down 2 or 3 stairs into an all fours position; have your partner support your shoulders to balance you. Remain in this position for about 5-10 minutes or as long as comfortable. Also do this on an empty stomach.<br>  <br>        The following techniques to turn breech babies to vertex involve the assistance of a specialist or medical professional:<br>  <br>        15. Acupuncture - find a acupuncturist who is familiar with pregnancy and knows the points to stimulate for turning a breech baby. <br>  <br>        16. Webster's Breech Technique - see a Chiropractor who is experienced in this technique.<br>  <br>        17. External Version - this can be done in the hospital at about 37 weeks; see an Ob-Gyn for assistance and more information.<br>  <br>  Number 13 worked for me<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|zPYyGw8oaa	At 38 weeks it is very difficult...you can get an excersize ball and have her sit on that as much as possible while rotating her hips...there is also a way for the doctor to do it but it is painful and they don't tend to do it anymore...C-sections are not bad, at this point she has no choice so just relax and the baby may still turn on his own.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I don't know about the two of you turning the baby but I know that the doctors can and I'm sure they will try to turn it before they go in for a c-section. They will want to avoid one too!|`|cO9sxO9raa	Don't be too scared, everything will be okay. My friends water broke she was admitted and her baby turned right before her contractions were getting worse and she had to start pushing so she delivered on her own and everything was good. The baby could still turn any time before your wife is due. I'm sure everything will be good! Also I heard if she sits up, with her back straight or if she sits "criss cross" on the floor it gives the baby more room to move around so possibly the baby will turn that way. =)|`|wtdic2w7aa	I would talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Breech babies do not have to be born by C-section. Plenty of babies who are breech are delivered normally. Though it was my mum's third baby, my sister was born a true breech (i.e. bottom first as opposed to foot first, which is called a footling breech) and my mum says it was one of the least troublesome births she's had (and my sister came out looking lovely because she didn't get so squished!!!)|`|POGZZmoUaa	Sometimes breach babies turn before labor begins and sometimes the doctor can turn the baby prior to delivery.  Breach babies do not automatically mean a c-section.  Lots of breach babies are born vaginally. Talk to your doctor and good luck!|`|96RRWgQ2aa	It is possible for breech babies to be delivered vaginally. My aunt was.

pZCWKlkVaa	I am not for circumcision. The pro is that boys in general get less infections or foreskin problems in later life... however, since these problems are very rare anyway it is not a significant advantage. Con is that is is painful to do the procedure and unnecessary pain is not good. It can cause desensitization to the tip of the penis which your son won't always appreciate in later life when having an active sex life. <br>  <br>  xx|`|dM0YCWDhaa	I am completely against circumcision, and I left my baby boy intact.  His genitals are not mine to surgically alter for cosmetic reasons.  Most of the world does not circumcise, and the United States is catching on so more men will be left intact.|`|AA11987492	Really, there are no pro's to circumcision. And even if there were, it wouldn't be anything that couldn't wait until adulthood so he can choose for himself.<br>  <br>  I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the penis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis.... they are the ones that are missing parts<br>  <br>  One of the worst things you can do as a mother, is give your child cosmetic surgery to make them "fit in". Basically, you are saying, there is something wrong with you, you had to be fixed, and you should base your self esteem on what others think of you". Actions speak louder than words you know. If you are doing it because "That is what everyone else is doing" All I am going to say is, don't ever say no to your kids when they want to do something that is harmful to their health and they just want to fit in. Kids come home drunk or high? No problem, they just wanted to be "normal", You don't want them to be teased do you?????<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Boys can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	Circumcision is the amputation of the foreskin, not extra skin but an integral part of the penis; measuring 15 square inches in an adult, over half the penile skin, including the most sensitive parts of the penis. The foreskin is packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive.<br>  Not one major medical organisation in the world recommends routine infant circumcision anymore. The US is the last western nation still doing this to about 50% of its newborn males but even there rates are falling and many insurance companies no longer cover it, because it is deemed a waste of money. Sadly they often still don't use anaesthetic either and when they do it’s risky and ineffective. It's child abuse, pure and simple.<br>  The penis forms as one organ and at birth the foreskin is usually fused to the glans like a fingernail to its finger. So there is no cavity for germs and dirt to collect in until it separates naturally later, at an average age of 10. Only the boy himself should retract it and then he can be taught to skin back and rinse with plain water regularly.<br>  Misguided attempts to retract too early, often by doctors and nurses, are the main cause of damage to boys’ foreskins and the real main reason for childhood circumcisions.<br>  To perform a neo-natal circumcision the circumciser has to rip the foreskin away from the glans with forceps. Then the foreskin is either cut away or clamped until it falls off. Both methods cause the baby extreme pain and his raw glans and wound sting every time he urinates. It's quite common for the raw edges of the cut foreskin to fuse to the raw glans during the healing process, forming skin bridges or tags. These complications and other more serious ones are often not found till puberty and do not show up in complication statistics. <br>  More serious complications, though not common are immediate. Some babies lose their penis to infection, bleed profusely (often because they are haemophiliac) or even die each year.  <br>  The claimed benefits of circumcision are a beat up (based on flawed studies) and don't really exist but medical authorities have worked out that the overall complication rate is higher than all the benefits claimed by the pro-cutting advocates. One by one the claims are disproved but the pro-cutting zealots come up with more and keep quoting the old ones despite the evidence against them. For example you have more chance of dying from a circumcision or losing your penis from infection than from penile cancer. The rate of penile cancer is higher in the largely-circumcised USA than in European countries where less than 1% of males are circumcised. The US Cancer Society does NOT recommend routine circumcision.<br>  A very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.<br>  Using surgery to mutilate the genitals instead of washing in a modern western society makes no sense. Normal intact male genitals are even easier to wash than female ones and the same substance, smegma collects in the genital folds of both sexes. A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion of intact males. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream that speeds up the process. Many doctors don’t know about this in the US.<br>  I am circumcised and hate it. I wish I'd been given the chance to choose for myself. Intact men can choose to get cut at any time in their life, though most have no desire to do so. Many men resent being circumcised. It's just not something that most of us talk about a lot, even to our parents.<br>  Your son will grow up with many intact friends and there is every chance he will resent this unnecessary cosmetic surgery.<br>  Geoff|`|rAD0mL7Saa	Every 300-400 the thingy they use to do them fails and the little boy suffers problems. In severe cases they need reconstructive surgery to rebuild his penis. Before they got better at penises they used to turn boys into girls, but they don't do that anymore. I don't know if they've fixed this problem in the last two years, when it was still an issue. My mum's a nurse and she's seen a little boy nearly bleed to death from it. They say a pro is that later in life your boy's sexual partners have less of a risk of cervical cancer, but I don't know. You could always just teach your boy how to wash properly. I don't see any pro.|`|WxWiP3QJaa	There are no pros, and the con is that you are needlessly removing part of your child's body.<br>  <br>  You don't cut off your arms because you can't be bothered to wash your armpits, do you?|`|ergJxemEaa	i agree with her|`|TsjqzanQaa	Infant circumcision is infant sexual abuse.<br>  <br>  There are no pros to circumcision, only that the doctors make money from it.<br>  <br>  Victims of circumcision are more susceptible to HIV and other diseases, as the foreskin has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.<br>  <br>  The statistics prove that the rate of HIV infection is much higher among circumcised males than intact males.<br>  <br>  The US has had a very high rate of HIV, and also the highest rate of circumcision of any western country<br>  (that's not a theocracy).     The HIV rates in the various countries in Europe, Scandinavia, South America and Asia, where circumcision is rarely perpetrated on males, is invariably much lower.<br>  <br>  I would never harm a child, and certainly wouldn't mutilate either a boy or girl by the genital mutilation of circumcision.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|K4zsztkRaa	to me there is nothing good about being circumcised. Nothing. It's horrible.<br>  <br>  I would much rather be uncircumcised over anything<br>  <br>  The pros and cons of circumcision are an opinion. circumcision doesn' thave any medical benifits so they are only personal pros and cons.<br>  <br>  If it's for you do what you want. If it's for your child let him make his own choice.<br>  <br>  uncircumcised men have more sensitivity and they have more powerful orgasms. They are also less likley to ever get erectile dysfunction. So I'd rather not be circumcised.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|qXvFsnOcaa	In the old days the main reason used to be hygiene, but that's little more than urban myth these days. <br>  <br>  It was true in the past, but today even the poorest of American's has access soap and hot running water. Unless you raise your kid to be the world's greatest slob, and he never washes himself, or unless he lives in sub-Saharan Africa, there are no hygiene benefits at all.<br>  <br>  Even if your kid were to get an infection it would be easily treatable and wouldn't give them anything more than a little discomfort for a day or two, and it's mostly be their own fault for not washing (Most infections happen to teens because they sweat more and have more body hair, it's VERY rare for a baby to get an infection unless you are a slob and never wash them).<br>  <br>  There is a small chance that the wound might get infected after circumcision, though this is rare. There is also a small chance that there might be an accident that could result in loss/damage to the child's bits. The most infamous case of this was that of David Reimer, though this is very very rare.<br>  <br>  According to some people circumcision will make your child less likely to masturbate (some say that it will even make them less likely to be gay) but I think that this is mostly a scare story propagated by neo-cons who are afraid that circumcision rates are going down. Either way, it's based on an old belief imported from Britain, and almost nobody there even remembers the myth, let alone believes in it (Britain has almost zero circumcisions except for religious purposes).<br>  <br>  Personal, I think that it's an invasion of a child's privacy, and a child should be left till they are old enough to decide for themselves. It's thier body so they should be able to choose what to do with it.|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Every little boy who comes into the world is born, unless deformed, with natures best design, or evolutions best outcome for a penis.. you pick which, based on your beliefs. If he is born without a foreskin, the hospital consider him born with a deformity. <br>  <br>  The glans "knob" is designed to be an internal organ like most males of all species where there is a penis. The foreskin builds this aspect and gives way for the glans to emerge, totally alive with sensitivity, and in the best possible form to give the best sense of feel possible, direct to the sexual processing center of the brain. The conditions that it delivers this sensation is that of sliding where moist and slippery.<br>  After use to the designed purpose, and a wash, the foreskin closes and provides the necessary protection to this internal organ.The closed side of the foreskin is rich in feeling receptors as well which in nerve bundles, is the same that the labia of the female carries for feeling. The glans equals the same bundle as the clitoris...just more and spread for a larger surface.<br>  The function of the foreskin is equal to that of the eye lid which protect the eye ball from environ erosion and contact through rubbed or being dried. <br>  <br>  Both of these internal organs inter phase the environment to perform a specific function while being protected from the environment at the same time. They are similar.....different sensing.! <br>  <br>  I go into the above detail because somehow the usefulness of the foreskin seems to have become lost, or under some perverted drive to damage the male sexual experience and enjoyment, is being negated or overlooked?       <br>  <br>  The act of circumcision came into America in the warped anti sexual pleasure Victorian era with the main intent hinder boy masturbation.<br>  A second goal was to reduce the sexual pleasure of the male by desensitizing the glans of the penis through removal of the foreskin that protects the glans from getting rubbed dull, and dried onto regular skin which covers over the feelings receptors. It was not through Jew and Muslims, because there weren't many of these at all.<br>  <br>  Myths like going blind.. Insanity.. epilepsy.. Parkinson's.. deafness and a list went on ....about the cures and preventions of these many things thought circumcision and the hindering of masturbation.<br>  <br>  After people became wise to these, Cleanses, infections, cervical cancer, STD's  HIV, odor etc. all became the reasons.<br>  <br>  Myth ....Cleaner Baby boys are born with the foreskin bonded to the glans until around around age five, or puberty for some. Totally clean and safe. the only cleaning is washing the outside and the foreskin opening like a finger.  Way less work for Mom.   For an adult male, it takes 1/ tenth of a second to slide the foreskin back to wash with baby shampoo for children and adults, a good warm clean water rinse, and close it up again...no rubbing to dry it!..rubbing it is so not good ever!<br>   <br>  There are more infections caused by circumcision that those showing up on a natural make with good hygiene.<br>  <br>  Myth....Cervical cancer...It is more likely for a male to pick up the HPV virus from a woman than it is for a woman to get circuital cancer because of a foreskin. Her places to harbor it are far more extensive than a male with a foreskin, and places where she can't get to. <br>  <br>  Myth....STD'S and HIV STD and HIV are contracted from having sexual relations with a person who is infected ,and not the result of having a foreskin. A circumcised male is equally at risk when having sex with an infected woman. During sex, fluid carrying the infection is forced into the urethra, giving access through the mucous membrane<br>  of which the entire urethra is.<br>  <br>  Fact.... Circumcision on an infant is a living hell with no anesthetic because of the instability with infants. The pain is more than an adult could handle, putting the infant into a state of  physical shock and emotional despondency. The emotional impact is still under study as well as the later anger which surfaces on many adult males with seemingly no found sources.<br>  <br>  It is the worst kind of sexual molestation and physically damaging as well leaving the child with no will or choice as what he is left to live with for his entire life. It is like rape..with no element of choice being left. Some don't remember on the surface, but the trust dynamics take major impact. <br>  <br>  There will be young men in the future, suing the butts off someone for mutilating them and jading them from what was theirs. I consider becoming a lawyer to help with some of these. At 24, it's well within my reach.<br>  <br>  It may seem remote to associate an infant to a sex life, but the penis is only about sex. If it were for peeing, a little hole in the body anywhere would work just fine.<br>  <br>  Me! :- l|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century.

I don't buy the pros like fewer infections - studies on this are all over the place and there's nothing conclusive. However the risk of complications is well-known and documented but a lot of peole don't consider that. Also I think it should be something for the boy to decide. Here's something with some good FAQs: <a href="http://oknocirc.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://oknocirc.blogspot.com</a> and also <a href="http://circresearch.googlepages.com" rel="nofollow">http://circresearch.googlepages.com</a><br>  <br>  Harriet
xRYqhzKxaa	I don't think they're boyish at all!<br>  <br>  Massima sounds softer and sweeter with the S to roll it off the tongue. It pretty and classy too. Maxima is equally beautiful. (the name of Holland's princess!)<br>  <br>  If you look for name Italian names, I personally favor names with "ella" on the end :) (Gabriella, etc)<br>  <br>  But don't listen to people who think its a boy name. Maxima means "greatest" in Latin, and your baby girl will light up your world anyway that you choose to name her.|`|HVcJfYpMaa	I don't really like those names but I do like the name Bianca. It means white in Italian.|`|qTKSvULiaa	Massima. but i recommend finding a better girl name. those sort of sound more towards boys names. no offense|`|fd3ggguFaa	Massima..<br>  Maxima sounds more like a boy name.|`|biBJAzUoaa	no|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	there gross|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	UGH!<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are naming your poor daughter after a condom. (I'm not kidding, I think there are condoms sold under those names.)<br>  <br>  If you like Italian names how about <br>  <br>  Angela, Sophia, Antonia, Theodora, Julia, Paulina, Ariadne, Aurelia<br>  Aurora, Alessandra, Rosalinda, Raffaella, Flavia, Fabiana, Francesca,<br>  <br>  or go here for over 1,600 other Italian names for girls.<br>  <a href="http://www.nomix.it/700a.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nomix.it/700a.php</a>|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Isnt maxima a car???

Sorry.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	Sorry but they sound like boy names
yNNdHDKvaa	It sounds to me that your baby is fixing to make a grand entrance and or exit,..(however you want to look at it),... in about 8 more weeks,...it is just probably getting into position. You may want to check with your Doctor ,to be sure though.|`|ELIKp5tDaa	lol normal ;) i remember my brothers and sister going nuts while my mum was pregnant and you could literally watch and see where they moved hehehe<br>  looked awful funny watching her belly shift and wobble like that and see little fists or feet pushing and 'sticking out' of her tummy|`|5wn8Lksdaa	Totally normal. At about that point in my pregnancy my baby would move so much that every day my tummy seemed to be a different size/ shape!|`|ncHDtTKJaa	Def normal my lil girl goes all over the place lol

Don't panic, just call your doctor and let them know of ALL your symptoms.  This way, your answer will be from a medically experienced doctor who knows your current history, and not just some faceless person via the internet.  It's better to call to be sure than not.  Especially if your having doubts/concerns of yourself and child's health and safety.
ZbnxGIsnaa	Nope!  I didn't have any discharge with my ovulation this month and I am now almost 6 weeks pregnant.  Every woman is different when it comes to cycles.   So, you don't have to have discharge in order to get pregnant, but it does help!
O3EtP4vOaa	The opening when you wipe is not your cervix?? Your cervix is located at the top of your vaginal canal.  If you are pregnant your cervix would be closed and you would have to really reach up there to feel it.  Go to the doctor is you want to know and have them tak ea blood test.|`|fGiWrun5aa	good
AlxMp9l3aa	You can still carry on with exercise as normall as long as it does not endanger the pregnancy.  A lot of proffesional athletes still carry on there day to day activities check out these websites.<br>  <br>  What exercise is appropriate?<br>  <br>  ? Gentle Swimming - if previously an active swimmer<br>  ? Water Aerobics<br>  ? Aqua natal, water aerobics specifically for pregnancy<br>  ? Low Impact Aerobics - avoid quick changes in direction<br>  ? Step Aerobics<br>  ? Light Weight Training - with appropriate instruction<br>  ? Walking<br>  ? Fitness Suite/Cardiovascular Machines - avoid the stepper and rower in later stages of pregnancy if you feel discomfort<br>  ? Pilates<br>  ? Specific static abdominal and pelvic floor exercises<br>  <br>  Please note: It is not advisable to start any of the above as a new activity during pregnancy apart from Aqua Natal or gentle walking. If you wish to carry on exercising outside of these activities, seek medical advice.|`|CcgDj9GIaa	You're 8 weeks pregnant; that means that you're still in those "dangerous first three months" of your pregnancy.  Light excersize is okay, like some stretches, even yoga.  NO HARD EXERSIZES!!  Stay away from the trampoline.  Even if there's a net, you still are at risk of tripping and hitting your tummy. <br>  <br>  Just to be on the safe side, consult your physician and ask him/her what's safe to practice and what is not.<br>  <br>  Take Care and congrats!
WPI0Z47saa	My mom conceived me and my brother during her period since this is just when her body ovulated and even had a period the whole nine months with me and 7 with my brother. I would imagine that it would be harder to detect the color of the discharge since it is mixed with blood but the consistancy may be a little different.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you that it is impossible to conceive during your period. It isn't common but it does happen.|`|cnK4X2sZaa	you can conceive on your period but it is VERY unlikely. You are more likely if your periods are frequent and irregular. Less likely if you have regular periods.
wyAtVqbOaa	It really does depend on the body and the shape before you become pregnant. <br>  <br>  I have a friend who was a size 16 before she fell pregnant and now being 8 months pregnant she still doesn't look pregnant - just fat as per the norm.  <br>  <br>  Another friend, was pregnant and didn't look it until 20 weeks when all of sudden she popped out.  <br>  <br>  I was about 18 with my first and 14 with my second.  <br>  <br>  KD|`|C4ibOR7Laa	im 17weeks with my first baby and im just starting to show now<br>  <br>  why am i getting thumbs down???|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Depends on the person. I have a larger friend who carried her son to full term without it becoming visible at all...<br>  <br>  I am naturally very small and my bump started to show at around 10 weeks...although it wasn't "obvious" to strangers 'till I was 16 or 17 weeks.|`|VPVg792eaa	I would say this all depends on the size of the women carrying and amount of fluid they carry. I was a uk size 6 when i fell pregnant with my son started showing by the time i was 8 weeks with my daughter i was a uk size 8 and carried so much fluid i was showing by the time i was 6 weeks but you will find the bigger the women the later she will show and if you do not carry a lot of fluid you will show later <br>  hope this helps and good luck with your story xx|`|FH2iKFcJaa	I am 15 weeks with my first and I am showing a little. No one can tell you an exact time because some woman show at 3 months and some do not show until 6 months.|`|sRvgHISSaa	id say anytime between 16 to 20 weeks some women don't show much at all till 20 weeks my bump was very small and with cloths on i didn't look pregnant not until after 20 weeks x|`|inFdpMr6aa	the norm is 10 to 14 weeks but in some extreme cases it wont be visible for 16 weeks|`|6nq1IiqXaa	becomes visible after 12 weeks id say, just over 3 months|`|Q8tf4B5taa	you get a small bump at 3 months, your belly goes hard but you will properly start to show between 4 and 5 months
IOp3knBjaa	At that time frame the ultrasound can pick up something, but it will look nothing like a baby. I had my first ultrasound with my oldest son at 6 weeks. He looked just like a peanut!! The earliest ultrasound I remember having where the baby started to resemble a baby is 9-10 weeks, but even at that time it didn't look right. Ultrasounds, at least in my opinion, start to look better at around 16-18 weeks. By that time the baby looks more like a baby, everything is closer to where it should be and the baby has built up a little fat so it doesn't look all boney. Best of luck to ya!|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	Yes... but it doesn't look like a baby.  It looks like a little bean.  At that time frame the heart is beating, and it is surreal to see the little life being formed.|`|bGRexKPyaa	I was 6 weeks when I was only able to see an egg sack. A round circular shape.<br>  <br>  8 weeks you can see the heartbeat..<br>  <br>  You have a better chance at 12 weeks to see the actual shape of ur lil bby:]]|`|PGiOSIBkaa	I was 7w2d and got an ultrasound and seen the baby and heard the heartbeat.|`|Agke8iBGaa	I had an internal US with my first  at 7 weeks and he looked like a misshapen baby.<br>  but still a baby.<br>  <br>  an external one it may still look lie a bean or a lump.|`|LRke7SdKaa	probly months|`|96HWpdkFaa	I saw my baby at 7 weeks on the ultrasound and got two pictures!|`|H0fXySX9aa	4 weeks there is a gestional sac<br>  5 weeks a yolk sac<br>  6 weeks onwards a fetal pole with heart beat
Yc6eUIW9aa	Sounds like you could be.  Take a test to be sure.<br>  ..|`|O3EtP4vOaa	No most likely you are not pregnant.  It would be too early to have pregnancy symptoms.|`|ATBHG0ztaa	I think you've just got the stomach flu. If you had your period, I think you're just getting over whatever nasty bug you had.
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	As the first person said, it's actually less likely that a baby in an animal-friendly home will have that particular allergy.  However, it does happen.  In that case, the first step would be to talk to the pediatrician about the severity of the allergy and what steps could be taken to keep the baby healthy.  Sometimes it's as simple as extra cleaning and limiting where the animals can go in the home!|`|O4M6BEDJaa	Actually they say that newborns that are raised in a home with animals from the time they are born are less likely to have allergies to animals. But if for some reason the baby would become allergic then you'll have to find the animals new homes.
UUysEV0yaa	The baby sounds like it is ready. Its making the final moves down into your pelvis. Dont go far from the hospital over the next few days, my guess it that you will have baby number 2 very soon!<br>  <br>  ps the whole going to the toilet thing is the baby putting pressure on your bowels as it moves further down into the birthing canal.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Your show; can occur hours up to a week before labor. Your "flu like symptoms with out fever" can occur to hour to days before labor also this is where your diarrhea, nausea, or mild cramps occur; this is natures way of cleansing for the baby. I would say with what you have described your baby is definetly making its way for labor possibly within the next few days! :0) good luck!
382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	This was taken from a medication website:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, inform your doctor immediately. You should take Azimax during pregnancy only if it is clearly needed. It is not known whether Azimax can make its way into breast milk. If the drug is essential to your health, your doctor may advise you to stop breastfeeding until your treatment is finished.<br>  <br>  Lots of luck!<br>  <br>  Lol, same info.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	From what I can read it says only to take it if it is absolutely necessary. But if your doctor prescribed that antibiotic to you then they obviously know what's best!
O3EtP4vOaa	It doesn't matter if you tell him know or later you are still probably going to have the same reaction from him.  If you live in his house and he supports you then you do need to tell him.  But it is your life and you are an adult and you can make your own decision.  Also do not get married just for the sake of the baby you are very young and life changes and so do feelings, only get married if you truely want to.|`|2kZ6YGXsaa	Wow. Well your mom obviously feels strong about this. First off, you shouldn't rush into marriage just because you are pregnant. Your dad is very wrong about that. My guess is that your mom doesn't like keeping secrets from your dad. I would wait, though, to tell him if he is that bent on you being married when you are pregnant. However, if you and your fiancee break up before the wedding, tell him anyway. He doesn't deserve to be kept in the dark. Oh, and make sure you go and get tested and have an ultra sound and all that!|`|dAkjYoVraa	Being pregnant is a big deal. Telling your dad shouldn't be the big issue and he shouldn't be so imature about it either. It happened and now you need to make plans not argue about the past. Best advice for you is what you're going to do now not how everyone will react. I think you should try planned parenthood they should be able to help you out also. Marriage does not solve any problems either. Marriage is when you've met the person you want to be with for the rest of your life not some 1950's solution to pregnancy. If you're having problems talking to your dad about it then you should have your mom talk to him first when you're not around that way he has time to react and not go nuts in front of you (making a fool of himself).
rNvXWMOMaa	Spanking is an acceptable form of punishment<br>  for misbehaving children.<br>  <br>  Time out - grounding is a joke.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	some parents hit their children for the same reasons that some adults hit other adults:  poor impulse control, rage, etc.<br>  <br>  some parents spank their children because they believe it to be more effective than other forms of discipline.  i am not among them, but i can certainly acknowledge that they love (not just "claim to love") their children.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I don't know.<br>  <br>  What causes them to lock their kids up, or take away things which they love, or force them to stay in one place?<br>  <br>  Oh wait. That would be "grounding", "taking away privileges", and "time out".<br>  <br>  So yeah, I do know. They have a desire not to raise spoiled little brats, so they discipline their kids when they behave badly.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Parent who hit do so due to Uncontrollable anger. Lashing out due to stress. Emotional or mental instability.<br>  Spanking (not hitting per say) is used as discipline by many parents. Children model adults behaviour. Children model parent's behaviour. So parents who spank must be very proud when their children then retaliate to conflict or to behaviour displayed by a classmate that they don't find acceptable by smacking that classmate.<br>  Monkey see monkey do. <br>  As an adult, you don't resort to striking other adults because of unacceptable behaviour. Why is it acceptable to strike your own child  who is completely dependent on you for their every need? Who are one quarter or one half the size of you and who are physically much weaker? Who need to learn how to mange their own behaviour and tolerate other people's behavour in order to become a successful and happy adult within the restrictions of society. A society which deems striking another person as assault?|`|1tmX7xbRaa	if you mean actually HIT as in child abuse then i would say it's either a mental problem or that's how they grew up with their parents beating them.<br>  if you mean SPANK as in to correct an issue with the child then i think you are barking up the wrong tree.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	define  "hit"  if you mean spank, its called discipline, if you mean really hit, i dont have a clue.|`|fQ7nIwVqaa	well im a parent n sometimes i have to spank my son so tht he understands somethings are not acceptable...<br>  most of the time if he is being spoilt/stubborn i just ignore him time he calms down n then repeat wht i want him to do but sometimes he gets into a temper in starts screaming to b listened to...<br>  i apologise later for spanking him n explain my reasons...<br>  i just do what feels rite...|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	there is a difference between a spanking on the bottom and "hitting" your child. It is called unconditional love. You try to teach your children what is right even if your mad at them. Spanking your child is meant to teach them a lesson not to cause unbearable pain to their butt!|`|ddP3klT3aa	Because every one has different levels of patience/tolerance. All parents are different. I would never hit my kid across the face, but I think spanking is ok for serious offenses. I don't think people should spank their kids all the time.|`|W9dabUw7aa	People shouldn't hit people. Basic Rule. Some people hit even if they are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, but being angry can feel like they are under the influence...of their own temper.|`|AA11481603	More information please|`|AA11452643	Spare the rod and spoil the child.|`|FGMDbhoJaa	Shut up.|`|FQxbwbtlaa	they r stupid or difrent or bullys|`|EkzSAZ2Jaa	Spanking isn’t right. It’s not so much the pain, but the humiliation, and if the parent wants to do that to his defenseless kid, something isn’t right with him mentally. There is nothing you can’t correct with words.<br>  I have only been hit ones by my mother, I was 13 at the time. I am 28, and I look back and wish with all my heart that I am not like her when raising my kid. I will not blame anything, from broken cap to unpleasant phone call and my figure on my kid and yell and say horrible, vulgar things to him all the time. I just wish I will be a better parent. And I will never ever hit my kid(spank). That will be humiliating for him, lower his self esteem, and it just isn’t right. I still think that people that spank their children are bullies with low self esteem and with control issues. And they don’t love their children. They want to humiliate them, that’s all. Do something to someone under their total control that they can’t do to other people around.<br>  Because there is nothing like - you must hit your kid to make him understand the wrong from right. Words are more then enough. And I already said – spanking is worse then hitting, it’s not only the pain, but also the humiliation. Both are inadmissible when dealing with a kid.|`|qEGl3J4jaa	If we are talking about discipline and not abuse then it is from love. Look at the out of control generations that have been created by the lack of guidance and real discipline. I certainly want my children to grow up into a world where they and the others around them have been taught right from wrong and respect for other people.|`|Jq1ILZpNaa	whoever would say shut up, is heartless. and if you're joking about this situation you're not far off... but if you're being serious. i know exactly what you're talking about. i had a similar situation when i still lived at home. she was "susie house maker" at all the ball games and pamper chef parties but behind closed doors she was hateful and abusive towards my sister and i. after years of therapy and classes my sister and i came to the conclusion that she hated herself so much.. that whenever my sister or i came around she saw TOO much of us in her.. and she snapped.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|hNqzNELoaa	they love you<br>  all their doing is training you so you do what's right when you get older<br>  trust me i'm 13 and my mom yells at me for no reason!<br>  it's so annoying!<br>  but they just want the best for you<br>  i mean didn't they go through all this before?<br>  i think they know what they're doing(:
8YbChwt9aa	1. Autumn is a really pretty name to me. <br>  2. Violet is also a rather pretty name.<br>  3. Summer is cute.. but not a serious enough name to me, as in when she becomes an adult.<br>  4. Goes in order, favorite to least, Autumn, Voilet, Summer.<br>  5. The name Autumn peaked at popularity most in the 90's, slowed down a little now but currently still a little popular. <br>  6.

Autumn, sweet, creative, shy, academically good, sophisticated. <br>  9. Violet, shy with unfamiliar people, outgoing with friends, funny, sporty. <br>  10. Summer, sporty, outgoing, funny. But I don't think you should take my judgement of the summer name, because a friends friend of mine is a stripper named Summer, so I've never been too fond of that name. <br>  <br>  I think you should go with Autumn, its a beautiful name. <br>  ... I wish my name were Autumn.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	Like Autumn a lot!<br>  Love Violet<br>  Summer is practically my favorite name<br>  Summer is my fav<br>  Autumn isnt too popular no ive never met anyone named this<br>  Violet, never met anyone named this<br>  Summer never met a Summer either<br>  Autumn would be aubern hair, intellegent, sweet<br>  Violet would be classy, dark hair, pretty<br>  Summer would be talkative, frivioulous, adorable<br>  <br>  Go with Summer and good luck!!!|`|SN7YHJTbaa	1) I LOVE IT<br>  2) I LOVE IT<br>  3)I LOVE IT<br>  4) Hmm, thats hard cuz I love all of those names... probably summer because it reminds me of summer (the season) and Summer Roberts from the OC.

Someone with great taste.<br>  10) Stuckup and snobish...Every Summer I've known has been like that anyway!|`|Ya1zZORIaa	First, congratulations on your new bundle of joy coming!<br>  Now to your questions...<br>  1.) Autumn- really like it, it is suttle and warm <br>  2.) Violet- I just love love love that! Violet is a name that makes a little girl seem cute and has a great nickname (Vi). It ages well also.<br>  3.) Summer- eh.. it's okay. I like it but it isn't the best choice you have.<br>  4.) VIOLET all the way :D<br>  5.) I don't think Autumn is that popular of a name. I only know one Autumn, and 2 people with Autumn as a middle name.<br>  6.) Even though Violet is my favorite on your list, I am sad to say it is becoming popular. Especially after Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck named their baby that.<br>  7.) Summer is not too popular, not to my knowledge at least.<br>  8.) Autumn- A really pretty brown haired girl that is mellow and liked by all.<br>  9.) Violet- A super cute baby girl with the most beautiful eyes who grows up to be way gorgeous<br>  10.) Summer- sorry, but everytime I hear that name, I think of Susan Sommers. lol I just can't make myself like that name.|`|IFGSOd16aa	I knew this girl named Chantonia.<br>  She is ugly.<br>  never name your kid a weird name it will be ugly
ELIKp5tDaa	lol i called my family on my brothers tenth birthday and was talking to everyone, my mother said she had a dream that i was preggo, and asked me if i was *she was having these dreams before i was even sexually active lol* and i said yes<br>  so...problem solved<br>  what i would suggest is buying a really cute pair of baby socks that could be boy or girl socks and if your family is good at taking hints, hand them over to your mom and ask her what she thinks of the socks|`|yNNdHDKvaa	Six months after your wedding date.<br>  How?<br>   "Hey Mom,..guess what?,...I'm pregnant!!!

f49aab59bea9737e201eb6b2439035f2aa	the only one of mine that scarred was the 'queen spot' i.e, the first one to turn up...but that was purely because i didn't know what it was so it bled and....ew. but yea, pretty much if you scratch it then it'll scar|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	it will scar if you pick it. My hubby and I each have one in the same spot... in the middle of our forehead|`|SIhEme03aa	Only the ones that are picked or "popped" will become scars. The only scar I have is from when my dad picked me up and popped one that I had on my back.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	no you can't tell. best guess is that if they are scratched, they bleed, and turn to scabs it is a potential for a scar.|`|NigoVXX1aa	No chicken pox do not leave scar,but if you think so then let the patience drink a lot of water.|`|Ut9Y1xUoaa	only time will tell
rTaaIXSuaa	I never heard of a baby having to wear a helmet.<br>  Your baby's head isn't fully fused together when they are born. So it will look contorted. But as a child grows the head will take a normal shape naturally.<br>  Makes me want to question your doctor.|`|MeYILJeSaa	My cousin had to wear one for a while. I don't remember how long though-doesn't seem like it was that long. He's five now, and his head is nice and rounded out! :) You should try to stick to the 23 hours that the doctor recommends though.|`|IDS64Eh8aa	My friend's son had to wear one, is should really be 23 hours a day, if you take it off during the day it will take much longer to get sorted. Good luck|`|GNLYxY7kaa	yes my son had a very flat head all the way to five months, it is now rounding out perfectly. he is 8 months and likes to sleep on his side or tummy and is always sitting or crawling, trying to stand. since he is rarely laying on his back its really rounding out on its own just fine.|`|l4gqo2LBaa	I have never heard of that before!?<br>  <br>  Arent all of our heads a little flat in the back?
75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	why don't you do a little research into this online. and maybe speak with your own OB. most are OB/GYNs. maybe call around to see if you can speak with an OB about their thoughts and suggestions. i can't imagine med school would be easy or everyone would be there :)
MubTZUKXaa	Apparently, the helpline states that no one will get their grant until May.  The grant comes into effect on April 6th, you are able to apply before this date but won't get it until after the grant starts and they clear the backlog of applications...|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I've actually never heard of that before.  More info would have been great!  Never mind I googled it u have to live in the UK to get it.
ce242ed5158fddbbd7d2bd6a7e4cfd17aa	Yes she can get pregnant but the odds are reduced...to the exact extent can not be said<br>  <br>  now couple with that the fact you were using a condom and she was on the pill and I would say your are safe....personally I would say 99% percent chance she isn't pregnant|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, the chances are very very low.Good luck|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	i don't think there is any way she would be pregnant...|`|gurk4zTpaa	No contraceptive is a 100% guarantee. If you have a wife, you should know that by now. If she had her period, then OF COURSE she isn't pregnant. But your question sounds like you're wondering if you can have unprotected sex during her menstrual cycle. You indeed can have sex, however she may get pregnant during that time. A period isn't a free-for-all sex finale. You have just as much chance as if she wasn't on her period.|`|BbdWpp1Caa	I don't think so at all. I do it all of the time and I haven't gotten preg. (mine was withdrawal) (I'm in a good position for one if it did happen though)
8C87ZfMwaa	Sorry for the loss of your baby in 2003, i have 3 girls and have miscarried twice also.  Congrats on your son.<br>  I am 29 weeks with my fourth girl and have been taking progesterone since 13 weeks for a very irritable uterus.  My cervix has been as long as 45mm and it's now 35mm.  I am on rest also and am hoping to go on for a bit longer yet.  I have been told that if my baby was to come now it would be fine. Over 90% chance of survival with minimal complications.  I have had 2 of my babies at 36 weeks and one of them tried to come at 32 weeks which was successfully stopped.<br>  Progesterone apparently has been shown to prevent pre-term labor, I am having some major braxton hicks contractions so if i wasn't on progesterone not sure if i would still be pregnant!|`|C55pji5Qaa	So sorry about your loss.I have had cervical shortening throughout and bed rest had actually increased it twice and kept it pretty steady,until now but my best friend had a cervical length of .7mm at 25 weeks and she delivered 2 nights ago at 31 weeks(with twins).She held out 6 weeks(in the hospital) and for the most part the babies are very healthy.They did receive corticosteroids for their lungs.Progesterone will help and the bed rest will too but every single day and week is a milestone. I read that 1 day in the womb equals 3 days outside of the womb so the farther she can make it the better.Medical technology is so good now,so that should give you hope.Babies can be born at 24 weeks and survive but that is not what you want.My MFM gave me goal dates he said to try to make it to each one 28,30,34 and 36 weeks.Good luck,she needs your support!|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, First sorry to hear about your lose of your first baby and Congrats on your second baby. Now your wife's cervix might be able to hold off till 34 weeks if not longer.I think she would be better in hospital to be checked over to make sure everything is fine but it depends if she feels comfortable there or at home. Ok now if your baby was born at 28 weeks along, he/she would have a wonderful % of surviving.My aunt had twin girls born at this stage and they are both now 1 and half yrs old.(you wouldn't even picked it).<br>  <br>  As for progesterone,here is a useful website that will help you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.natural-progesterone-advisory-network.com/what-does-progesterone-do/" rel="nofollow">http://www.natural-progesterone-advisory...</a>
VPVg792eaa	If you don't agree with smacking your children i would strongly suggest each time he does this you Tell him no that is not nice in a stern voice then put him down away from you or anyone else some were that he has nothing to do no tv no toys tell him until he says sorry he stays there walk away and ignore him for 2 Min's then go back to see if he is ready to say sorry keep doing this until he says sorry but do not give him cuddles and attention because it will continue <br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|5ZvALiclaa	you need to say NO in a very firm authorative voice and put him down straight away. I don't mean yell at him or anything but really let him know that slapping is not okay by say NO. <br>  Don't talk to him about saying sorry and its not nice and all that because at 2yrs its all just going over his head and he's getting attention from you regardless that its good or bad attention.<br>  <br>  if you keep saying NO firmly and putting him straight down he'll get the picture soon enough because he is not getting any attention from you. Don't give him eye contact of 30sec-1min after he you put him down and then go on as normal. If he does it again, keep persisting with it|`|eth48m7Iaa	you need to put him in time out or smack his hand lightly and tell him it hurts. cuddling him doesn't teach him. after time out you can hug him, but if you are not consistent he will keep doing it.|`|0ky4TktEaa	That child needs a spanking. Start off with a very firm "you DO NOT hit mommy!" and an immediate swat on the hand the slapped you. Put him in time out in a designated spot. Explain he's there because he hit mommy and reiterate that "you DO NOT hit mommy!" Leave him there for 2 minutes; make no eye contact and don't speak to him. If he gets up, bring him back. You can do this repeatedly until he realizes you mean for him to stay. Or if you're like me and believe that parents should never chase their kids around and around, give him another swat and tell him to stay on that chair until you say he can get up. <br>  <br>  He needs to see that you mean business. If you don't even take what you're telling him seriously, why should he? Some children respond to different things, some have a very limited range of what works. Obviously, telling him it's not nice to smack mommy is a waste of time. Try something different that he understands like taking something (toy, treat etc). Time outs may or may not work. Learn what's effective for him.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you aren't one of those people who think that spanking and hitting are the same thing and teach children that hitting is ok. Spanking, when done appropriately, teaches children that when you do certain things and take things too far, you get a very stern correction. Enough of those corrections, the undesirable behavior begins to stop happening as often. My parents spanked me as a child and i'm glad of it. I'm thankful my mom was not one of those parents who talk their kid to death explaining what's not nice blah blah blah. It's pure and simple: smack mommmy, you get a spanking. Make the association and you'll see the behavior stop.|`|dyv2sqtxaa	It may seem like a small problem now, but eventually, it may get worse and more severe. I think the best thing for you to do is speak to him seriously when he does this. If he hits you and thinks it's funny, tell him that hitting is bad and give him a warning. If he hits you one more time, he will have to time out. (Or you can have a corner called "The Naught Corner" and place him in there for 2 minutes... 1 minute for each year of his life). After he has taken his time out, make him apologize for what he did and then give him a hug and continue on with your day. But I think the worst thing you can do with this problem is just push it aside and forget about it. Things like this usually tend to get out of hand and when they do, it becomes a very hard habit to break. Nip this problem in the butt while its small and controllable! Good luck dear!<br>  <br>  ~kori|`|pZCWKlkVaa	This happened with my cousin, eventually we realised it was because her mum was paying her attention (even if it was negative attention) whenever she slapped her mum. We watched a program called Tiny Tear-aways that gave great advice on how to manage this sort of behavior. My aunt stopped talking to her so much when she was slapped, instead she said in a firm voice "No" and immediately put her down and gave her a time out. During the time out she would not speak to her or look at her, just kept putting her on the chair if she got off it. It worked like a dream. Lucy is 5 now and has not slapped her mum or another child since she learnt she wouldn't get any attention for it.<br>  Hope that helped.<br>  xx|`|D3Fyxj0raa	my son is 2 and he is doing the same thing ive told him no and put him in time out but it doesn't work so if u get sum good advice please pass it on to me i don't believe in the hitting him back b/c then he would think its ok and keep doing it|`|145RUNQHaa	First answer sounds good the answers who say 'slap his hand lightly'or 'slap him back' don't make any sense.you are trying to teach him not to slap right?it would just end up like two nursery children fighting in the play ground saying you hit me first!the key is not to make a big deal as that just draws attention to the whole thing and then your toddler will just use it every time he wants your attention negative or not.i would just hold his hands away from you and say no and divert his attention quickly point at something and have a chat to take his mind off it.i wouldn't force him to say sorry perhaps later on you could mention it and ask him to kiss it better which might be better for him to understand.why he's doing it makes a difference too if he's doing it through frustration divert his attention instead putting him down and ignoring may make him feel his feelings are being ignored putting his feelings into words can help so he knows you understand how he feels.i have a nearly two year old myself it's a challenging age but they are so adorable you certainly can't stay mad at them for long.x
pzLDXL6gaa	1. I think about 90% effective, it's pretty good within 24 hours.<br>  2. Not sure of that particular one but don't see why it would be less effective than the others.<br>  3. I can't give you a chance I'm afraid, but pretty low considering you took the map.<br>  4. The pill can change this - might be in a week, maybe earlier or later. If you don't get one in 3-4 weeks take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|eth48m7Iaa	I have taken it and it does work. I had the same problem. You should probably get on birth control because the day after pill is expensive.

It's cool on him. But this other I know who also wears novelty briefs, could wear the same ones as my mate, and just not be able to pull them off.

And he was very right.<br>  I could die at my third miscarriage!!!<br>  <br>  Only when a pregnancy is well, just by itself, you shall know it will last - duh.<br>  Talk some longer with your gynecologist, and see what investigation are in view to know better your problems, if there is any problem.

You'll hear contradicting stories on the amount to take, some say more but i've always read everywhere that taking too much is bad for your baby. <br>  <br>  I personally was taking Asda/Walmarts on brand which was cheap, then i started taking Pregnacare as it's a prenatal vitamin.
WO7WAP19aa	Dont be fooled when your periods dont arrive on time! i have a regular cycle & one time my periods came 10 DAYS LATE !!! yes, thats right, 10 days, it was soo confusing & frustrating, i got nothing but countless negatives tests, & now ive learnt that if you are pregnant its going to come up positive when you first take the first test when your period is due! regardless of them people that get tests a week after their periods i now know that thats them & that is rare, i believe that it will happen when your ready, not when you 'think' your ready, just let nature take its course, so no, i dont think your pregnant i think your just late for your periods. it happens!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck though hun xXx|`|C4ibOR7Laa	get a blood test done by your gp
VXQFT341aa	As soon as their nose and mouth are suctioned and they are stimulated to breath. As soon as the head is out is when the nose and mouth are cleaned. Then once born helped to breath.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My son is 13 month old and is still a nose breather most of the time. The only time he is willing to breathe through his mouth is when he's sick and all stuffed up.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	hard to say through specifically their mouths. They don't breathe in-utero and their noses are plugged, and their lungs don't become functional for breathing until after they've been born. The breathing reflex has to be triggered specifically, and no-one knows the exacts of it. They do some time after birth, usually pretty quickly, and no-one knows yet what the exact triggers are. Babies breathe when still attached to the umbilical cord which is still attached to the placenta, so that's not it. They don't breathe during their time in utero or in the birthing canal if their waters have broken so it's not strictly about water. I think it's more to do with having the liquid being reabsorbed into their lungs making them functional, then after that it's just a reflex which gets triggered. They used to think it took cold air and a spank to get the reflex triggered, but they worked out that's wrong. Just one of those amazing things about the human body. We have the knowledge to breathe and hold our breathe when we need to. Hence the fact baths aren't dangerous for babies, they hold their breath if there's water splashed onto their faces and people teach their babies to swim.|`|1enIWBGnaa	When they're born!

OgzHcNMsaa	My husband thinks it's easy too. That's his basis for not helping me with the baby more. So one day I left her with him to go to the dr and run a few errands. After an hour he was ringing off my phone asking me when I was coming back.lol. I said its not that easy is it|`|3CVfUiiJaa	It isn't easy at all, and I wish men would understand this.  They can't though, unless they experience what it is like first hand.  My suggestion is to let him have the responsibility that you have all day, for a few days and see how he feels after.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Yes! My partner has never actually said 'you have it easy' but I know sometimes when he gets in from work and the dishes havent been washed he thinks 'what has she been doing all day.' But it is HARD work being a SAHM and i'd rather play with my daughter than spend the time doing the dishes and cleaning, so I usually leave most of it to when she is sleeping! I think he thinks I have it easy because whenever he is at home for the day I am here too so its obviously much easier to care for a baby when there are two of you! I wish there was something I could say to help you make him realise!! - I'm sure you're doing a fab job!!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Huh, that's funny. I just had an argument with my hubby about how hard a stay at home mom is. He told me that it would be the easiest thing, and I laughed. I said to him if he thinks it's so easy, he can take care of our daughter (who is teething btw) for a whole day with no help what so ever.  I can't wait to see what he has to say afterwards|`|SjX72fPyaa	Yeah my boyfriend told me the same thing. My response was to go out for a few hours leaving him at home with a cranky baby. And I silenced my cellphone so I wouldn't hear him calling me but I could still check to see if he did. After I got home he apologized like crazy and now offers to help all the time lol.|`|AA11885437	haha. when my daughter was 6 months old I got sick and had to be admitted to the hospital for over a week and hubby had to take over at home.

IN FACT it gets worse when husband gets home (cooking, washing the dishes, picking up their work clothes, etc...) <br>  <br>  I worked away from my son for 2 months and I thought it was easier to leave my son then stay with him all the time (I RATHER stay with him but being with a baby all day is emotionally draining and repetitive... and working allowed me to have a "break") <br>  <br>  -=sighs=- You need to listen to this song called "MR. MOM" it talks about a guy who switches roles with his wife while he is laid off and was looking forward to "long naps" and then he faces the reality of what being a stay at home mom is like. Its country but very cute!|`|JgZwvXXJaa	LOL tell him give my husband a call before I was a sahm I worked 40+ hours my husband was laid off for four months and took care of the house baby and all that he said he could not believe how exhausting it was and he had nothing but respect for sahm's also he is working 6 days a week 10 hours from 6pm till 4am and he still said he would rather work then stay at home especially now that we have two he is a pipefitter so it is not a easy job either|`|4iXL4C6paa	Oh I can definitely relate, my husband said the same thing and at the time we had 3 children but he got hurt on his job so now he is the one staying at home and our children are 6,3,2, and 5 1/2 months so his views have suddenly changed lol.  I seriously dont understand these men but they really dont have a clue until they are the one doing what we do......but from someone with experience I think of work as being my break lol.|`|DFAS6jRRaa	Alot of them think it. Its obviously not easy at all. My husband doesnt say it but sometimes when the house is a mess i know his thinking what were you doing all day to not get that done. Also he thinks well i go to a 8 hour job and come home and its another job to look after the baby and clean up a little so his job is 24/7 too. I disagree.|`|bi7SFqvDaa	I am a sahm of a 9month old. I have no sympathy from my bf. He is the eldest of 13, so i am constantly being held to a higher standard. he does help with baby, but he thinks i just sit at around all day! he doesnt want our baby to go to daycare, so i have stayd at home with him. its frustrating bc some days he understands and other days he thinks im being lazy... :( im in a constant battle.. so if you got any good helpful hints, plese send them my way!|`|cen8SIssaa	You are absolutely right....<br>  <br>  Its just that guys don't really understand and probably will never unless they experience it. that's why men are men and women are women and that we are all here for each other.<br>  <br>  Lucky for us though, that this is one of the hardest jobs in life but also the most rewarding!|`|e0368de96ef1a40f9fea200af07dfd35aa	As u can see with the replies its not just your husband. They do not the hard work we put into it.  If u are blesses with a family member close by...leave him the whole day with the baby. I just moved to Fl and have no help but I have escaped for hrs and unfort my phone is always ringing.|`|biBJAzUoaa	not really|`|1MEnCmwoaa	Really, men don't understand how hard it really is! my husband always would say 'well at least you get a 2 hr break when she sleeps' Then i would say yeah but that is when i do laundry etc... my husband used to work a lot also. A SAHM does more than stare at baby all day, there is housework too. Plus, each feeding takes forever! Moms go 24/7, we don't get weekends off!<br>  I know a lot of women feel this way. Let him watch the baby all day one day and he will change his mind. My husband knows now how hard it can be because i am on bedrest with a 17 month old at home! so he has to help more and understands better now.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	I think every mom can relate. They just don't get it and there are no words that will change his mind. What you could do is plan a 'Mom's day out' and leave baby with Dad for the entire day. Go get a massage, pedicure, shop with friends; just get out of the house. I guarantee after a full day playing Daddy he'll be singing a different tune. Taking care of children is tough work but you probably make it look easy so he doesn't know any different. I bet if you showed him how tough it really is you'll get a little more understanding from him. It's not his fault, men just don't get it especially if they don't take an active role in caring for their kids.|`|N0D09Tneaa	OMG!! I hope i never run into your husband!! I have a one year old baby girl that I have been at home with since the day she was born.  I know how hard it can be.  There is no time for house cleaning or for yourself.  A child takes up ALL of your time.  Especially if you try to be a good parent. Tell him to stay home with the baby a whole day and see if he doesn't change his mind.  My husband used to think the same way until I made him watch her a few times...He almost went crazy! He says his oilfield job is much easier.  This is why women have babies not men.|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	i work two to three days a week and he works 5 days a week and he is always telling me that he wasn't here to make the mess so he doesn't see why he has to help clean i can't get everything done so when i ask him for help with the sink full of dishes that get left behind because i can only get so much done while im naucious  and pregnant and dealing with a 13 month old on top of it so ya i do wish that he could spend a whole week doing it him self.... on the days when he stays home with my 13 month old whild im at work he doesn't lift a finger the whole day and still wonders why the house gets messy|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I totally hear you.... My hubby doesn't say my job is easy but when he comes home, I need to cook, make lunch, do the dishes, clean up his messes after he gets home. He watches baby for me while I cook & do the dishes as if he was doing a favor for me but sometimes I wish he helps me once in a while. At least, hang his clothes back to closet, not on the floor or take out some food for me once in a while. He knows my job is hard because my baby wakes up very often at night so he knows I can't sleep well. But I think he thinks it's my job & he does his job at work. <br>  <br>  I have nothing to say to him....

VKQzj4Pmaa	Children at that age typically sleep for about 9 to 12 hours a night, and can take a 2 or 3 hour nap in the day.<br>  <br>  How many hours do they sleep at night? How many hours do they sleep during the day? Is bed time and nap time at the same time every day? More information about your situation would be helpful.
mpXiHvY2aa	In all honesty, I don't think your being selfish at all. There is nothing wrong with wanting to have your own baby shower especially when there is a great possibility that this will be your last chance to have one for yourself. It's celebrating the birth of the child that you are bringing into this world and there is nothing selfish about wanting that time to be about you and your baby!|`|l6y0Ec57aa	I don't think it's selfish at all.   A baby shower is like a wedding in the sense that it's a special day that every girl deserves to have all to herself and enjoy the attention.  I think your mom and your sister will understand.|`|51dd79ad81d73891cb8b8b0d303e4e4daa	I think you should have your own baby shower and don't feel bad about it. Your a pregnant mommy that wants to cherish the memories of "YOUR" baby shower, what is so wrong with that?|`|AHEFXgE7aa	I would talk to your sister about it.  Maybe she feels the same way as you do.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|98WKYtfwaa	Hun, i feel sorry for you being stuck in that bed everyday. <br>  <br>  I don't think you're being selfish at all, you've been cooped up in bed for months and like you said, this will be your first and last baby shower, so you want it to be a special memory that you can treasure. <br>  <br>  Tell your mother how you feel about this, i don't think there is a problem with having 2 seperate baby showers, i personally would want one to myself, i wouldn't want to share it.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I definitely think you deserve to have your own baby shower.  Your sister already had one herself and This will be your first and last one so yes I said you should explain to your mom about this.  And if she is worried about the food and other cost for baby shower than may be you guys can share some of the expense.|`|DTYHoinVaa	You deserve your own, why the hell should you have to share. Youve been through a lot. Have your own. She can come, but its not hers. LOL.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Have your own baby shower! You are def not being selfish, you deserve it!|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	Does your mom want to combine the two showers for her convenience or does your sister feel left out that nobody carried on with her second shower?  <br>  Would it be a problem for family members (and your mutual friends,) to attend and buy gifts for two showers held close together?  Is the point of the shower to get gifts for the baby or to be the star of the day, or enjoying the companionship of family and friends?<br>  Your wish for your own shower is understandable, it's another rite of  passage in your life.  But really, the baby book is something to make you happy, it's unlikely that your child would be interested in it until perhaps he or she is expecting their own child.  And at that point, it really won't matter whether there were one or two guests of honor at a party that happened 20-25 years earlier.<br>  It may be a little selfish to want your own party.  There is nothing wrong with that.  As you point out, you have never had one, while your sister has.  Talk it over with your mom, it may be more about her resources; money, time and energy to host the party without your help.  Hope you can come to a solution that will make you both happy.
VjmVuPZuaa	Short answer is - there are some tests you can take almost immediatly afterwards - but most chemist or pharmacy ones will ask you to wait till your first pee in the morning. A blood test is the most effective and direct way of knowing.<br>  <br>  As no doubt you know - If you are having unprotected sex and your partner ejaculates – even a little inside you, there is always the possibility of you becoming pregnant. The possibility lessens at certain stages of your cycle - and given you have only recently birthed, your hormones may not have sorted themselves out yet; Breastfeeding is mother natures contraceptive – but a new mother should not rely on this to keep her from not being pregnant!.<br>  <br>  There are two good articles on falling pregnant again so soon after birthing - <br>  <a href="http://www.reclaimsexafterbirth.com/questions3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.reclaimsexafterbirth.com/ques...</a><br>  and this one looks at the myths on contraception and breastfeeding<br>  <a href="http://reclaimsexafterbirth.com/breastfeeding-sex-fertility-contraception.html" rel="nofollow">http://reclaimsexafterbirth.com/breastfe...</a><br>  <br>  they might help a bit to answer your questions.<br>  <br>  Good on you for taking a stance and going for what you want. happy 'practicing' big smiles.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Test 2-3 weeks after you last had sex.  =)  Wow, I admire you for having another kid this early on.

ZbnxGIsnaa	Have sex during ovulation.  Definitely!!!!  But, have sex every other day when you reach closer to your ovulation and do the missionary style.  (man on top) it reaches closer to your cervix and after he's ejaculated into you.  Prop your bottom/hips up with a pillow and leave them elevated for 30 min.  Best of luck!|`|COZJaXY9aa	Try and relax and not stress about it! Dont make sex feel like a chore...i heard that those can make getting pregnant more difficult!! Just have fun with it!

etUFe6tJaa	I am not sure if you need a period to conceive, but after years of doing IVF the clinic sisters always like us to have a period before embarking on any fertility treatments.  Firstly it is easier to calculate the dates of conception if you do fall pregnant, secondly it is always best to shed the old uterine layer (in the form of a menstrual bleed), therefore giving you a fresh start on a new cycle.  <br>  <br>  Not sure if your blood test checked your entire hormone profile, it usually will give you a clear picture as to what is going on inside.  Just let your body rest a bit, sometimes after long durations of using contraceptive it may take a little time for the body to kick into its natural rhythm.<br>  <br>  I also would like to let you know if your period does not seem to be arriving any time soon, there are prescribed medications that can help bring on a period.  But I suggest you wait it out, it is always best to let your own body do the job.|`|6LxXR61Waa	No, you don't need a period.  You could ovulate and get pregnant and then you wouldn't have a period.<br>  <br>  However, since you just stopped b/c pills, it can take your body a few months to regulate itself again.  It is recommended that you wait 2-3 months before trying to get pregnant.  In that time, you'll probably start your period too and then it will, hopefully, be easier to calculate when you are fertile/ovulating.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tmBBywZsaa	No you dont need to have a period to concieve as some woman have been known to concieve a week after stopping the pill but it does make it harder to work out your due date etc??? bare in mind you need to except it takes a a good few days for you hormones to build for you to ovulate!!! I stoppes the pill on the 9th of the month and got my period on the 9 th of the following month i ovulated in between that on the 25th so hun give it a few weeks !!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	No, you don't need a period to conceive, but it definitely makes it a lot more difficult to get pregnant as you cannot calculate when you'd be ovulating, etc. .  .|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	hi hun, as far as i know you dont have to have a period...but i would go and get tested if i were you... i stopped my pill in dec, had af for 4 days in jan and havent had since...went to the gyne and had a scan and discovered i have PCOS.<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope you dont have this.

In regards to race and sexuality, my husband and I are both a huge mix of everything from spanish to latvian, to welsh to chinese etc so our kids and family are VERY mixed ethnicity, and many of our extended family and friends are black-my kids have grown up with that and it's never been an issue, it's just normal life to them. We also have many gay, lesbian and bisexual friends so my kids aren't phased over that either. <br>  I get a lot of critisism because my 5yo son does ballet, because that's a "girl" thing-it used to upset me, but now I just laugh at how ingnorant they are about ballet (it's harder work than most so called "boy" sports) and at their stupid stereotypes.<br>  <br>  We are trying really hard to raise our kids to be accepting and open minded-I might actually cry if I get a low score on those tests!

A cup works wonders as well!|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	My Dad's cat had a bad smell it ended up being a decaying tooth. If she smells that bad & you don't want to get clawed just put her in the bath she will do the rest herself.|`|6ITgXvBWaa	You can always bring her to a groomers.<br>  <br>  I know my cats love to get bathed at the groomers and are so nice, but once we try it at home they claw and scratch and cry. Its horrible.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Haha have fun, my daughter still has a faint scar on her chest from where her old cat scratched her in the bath.<br>  <br>  1.Put a towel on the bottom of the tub. Fill it with warm water. Not too shallow, but not high enough that the cat feels like it can't stand by itself.<br>  2.Get in WITH you cat. Sounds weird I know, but unless you have someone to help you it's the easiest way by far.<br>  3.With a cup run water over the cat until it's wet. Try not to get her face, ears or eyes wet. <br>  4.Use a small amount of cat or baby shampoo, and lather her up.<br>  5. Pour more water over her until ALL the shampoo is completely gone.<br>  6.Plonk her down on a town and wrap her up in another towel. Wait til she calms down a little, then try and dry her off.<br>  7.You may want to leave her in the bathroom until she's semi dry or you'll have water all over the house.<br>  8.Either use a hair dryer on the lowest setting to dry her, or let her dry herself.<br>  9.Make sure she stays warm.<br>  10.Do it all as fast as possible!!<br>  <br>  Ok, i'll admit I tried really hard to make that 10 steps. I should publish it ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck, and for yours and the cats sake I hope she didn't fall in the toilet-yuck!|`|6nn7f41Faa	Well, do not put the cat in while filling the tub, that's just looking for a cat fight. Secondly, if you hold her underneath her front legs, and stand her on her hind legs, it's much easier to control her and avoid being clawed.|`|TQW5E6olaa	When we used to take my terror of a cat to the vet (I wouldn't dare try bathing her, she's EVIL) they would restrain her and put a hanibal lector mask on her so she couldn't bite. <br>  <br>  Can you take her to a petco?|`|AkFag8tNaa	Tell her to cover her eyes and then give her a good spray w/oust?|`|s8VgyzE2aa	I had to give my cat two baths a day for 6 weeks when she was little because when we got her she had ringworm and I had to bath her in a special shampoo twice a day to get rid of it. It was not fun. I used the rubber gloves you wear when cleaning that go up to the elbows and I would get the water all ready and have a cup in there. Then put the cat in. She would just stand there and meow while I soaped her up, she didn't start to move around until I rinsed her so I just rinsed her quick and then wrapped her in a towel and dried her off best I could. With an hour or so she was dry the rest of the way.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	well, i read somewhere that you were supposed to pour soap on the cat, put it in the toilet, stand on the lid and flush it a few times,  make a clear path to the door and open the lid...of course i think it was written by the dog lol.<br>  <br>    maybe you could use baby wipes on her to get the smell off?.....i just bought some "soft paws" for my doggy...they are great, they cant scratch, they just slip up over the end of the claw and glue on like a fake fingernail, pretty neat,  cute too, looks like her nails are painted lol. they make em for cats too, of course this wont help you right now, but i thought it might be something for future reference :P<br>  <br>  i used to frequent the pet section, bunch of fruitcakes over there lol.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	I have heard  the same story as Arial, but it was a joke only. I would go with what Edg1 said.  Or my husband and I tag team our cats when it's bath time. I hold them and he wets them and shampoos, rinses. We do all this holding them in the bathtub. Once in a while they get free and jump out but not often. Our clothes get a bit wet so we wear old ones. And we throw a big towel over them after we lift them out of the tub so they don't drip all over the house and run off. Rub them dry a bit and let them go to finish them selves. Also not a good idea to go outside if cold out until they're completely dry if they're an outdoors cat.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	very carefully<br>  :-)
wZAeBisbaa	Horses.  I am not a horse lover - they scare me  - but I have learned to lead them around, groom and bathe them, and feed them.  I've even braided a mane.  I've been thrust into the role of "horse show mom," which means I run errands, hold horses, and remember every little item of clothing and equipment without which a rider cannot compete.  Oh, and pay for the gas, food, and lodging (for us and the horse).  It's a lifestyle that I never envisioned for myself, but it has been a great bonding experience with my daughter. It has taught her valuable lessons about responsibility, caring for an animal, managing money, and how to take the good and reject the bad in other people's judgments, which of course is what horse shows are all about.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	rock climbing.  my daughter is always begging to do a parent-child class.  that would kill me.  i'd have a panic attack and they'd have to airlift me down.<br>  <br>  <br>  *smile, just so we're clear:  i'm not a bear, either.  ;-)  but i have seen 16 bears (black and grizzly) in the wild.  so i do have a few extra surprises.....<br>  <br>  *i love smile, too.|`|j2mRop0laa	Oh gawd. Barbies. I think they are cute, I don't mind brushing their hair and changing them but it is torture to play Barbies with them.<br>  They say "Nooooo, she doesn't talk like THAT. She's the mean one, the nice one, the funny one. Hold her like THIS. Lift her arm up! Why are you sitting her THERE?" <br>  It drives me crazy and I flat out refuse to play anymore. They can play together and annoy each other to death.<br>  <br>  *eta- little troll, you got me! I have a poster of her avatar on my bedroom wall.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Play in her 3 foot doll house. And I'm 6'4.|`|MeYILJeSaa	My almost 4 month old wants to constantly be bounced. It kills my arms! But I suppose maybe I'll build up some muscle. :)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i dont mind the building part, but whenever i get an awesome structure going one of the kids want to knock it over.<br>  <br>  i'm not real fond of complete invisible stuff.  my daughter likes to play w/people i cant see and have me help her help the invisible people.  thats a little much for me.  i play along but i'm never sure when the invisible person is still w/us or if they went home to their invisible mommy and daddy.<br>  <br>  little troll - you forgot about me!  i thought you loved me?  i love you.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	My 15yo always wants me to come spend more time with her horse-we're still breaking him in, and due to lack of time it's taken longer than we expected. When she's bored she always quizzes me on our favourite tv show (we watch dvd re-runs everry friday) which I wouldn't mind but she ALWAYS wins haha. She answers every question I ask in exact minute detail, and then asks me really difficult questions and gets annoyed that I don't know the answer!<br>  <br>  My 5yo and 3yo always want mommy to sword fight, play ninjas, play the wii, play legos (I don't mind playing with legos, but apparently my creations just don't compare to daddy's or uncle jakeys) wrestle, face paint and ride the 4-wheeler-I leave that one to their dad, I don't want to be responsible for putting them in hospital haha. I TRY but I don't think they are usually very impressed. Except for my wrestling skills-I could turn pro ;)|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I am with Smile. When I was a little girl, I could play Barbies for hours. Now, she lucky if she keeps my attention for 15 mins.|`|MA9XuLlHaa	smile is in love with the idiot des.
t1fx6kXcaa	No way would I let my 9 year old personally express herself or find a (very small and hardly noticeable) way of being unique.<br>  If she had two piercings in each year she could grow up to be a...a...responsible adult who happens to have two piercings in each ear.......<br>  I was 8 when my mother allowed me to have my ears pierced<br>  I was 9 when she allowed me to have them pierced a second time<br>  Two tiny studs in each year was hardly a social atrocity. It hardly impacted on my ability to gain an education, friends or, as an adult, employment. My mother was very strict. I wore clothes suitable to my age. I did not wear makeup. I would not have been allowed to have a facial piecing. Yet I did manage to make it through life with two (and later three at 17) piercings in each ear.<br>  Go figure.|`|mxixfE3Raa	Yes. I think it looks ok, kids at the age of 1 have one piercing in each ear, so i'm sure 2 in each ear isn't that bad for a 9 year old.<br>  I really don't see how 2 looks trashy anyway, hello it's ear piercing, people can hardly tell the difference between having 1 and 2 unless u look closely.<br>  This is why kids rebel so much these days, parents try and wrap them up in cotton wool and are scared to let them grow up.|`|0iTNDPzoaa	Yes, I'm in my 30's and I had my ears pierced when I was 2. There is nothing wrong with it. Hasn't made me rebel or turn out into anything for a parent to cause concerns.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	My daughter is 10. No I wouldn't. Too young, personally I think they look trashy. She has her ears pierced and the school doesn't allow earrings at all not even a stud.|`|SIhEme03aa	Absolutely not!|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Absolutely NOT|`|85V6cHe4aa	No i would allow one hole in each ear but i think two looks trashy,|`|5ZbFdcwdaa	NO!|`|AA11899988	I allowed my daughter to get her second when she was about 9 maybe a little younger.  I didn't find it as a bad thing and it was to hard for her to keep up. She's now 14 and her second holes have been closed for about 3 years now. She says it was to hard to get earrings in the first and second holes. I only have one so I don't know, but from past experience I would say let her and if she doesn't like it you can always let them close up.|`|M1TgnTR6aa	i think its ok as long as she knows how to take care of it.|`|7EPLQzueaa	Shame on all you who maime your kids this way.I think it looks absolutely horrible on young kids to have their ears pierced at an early stage of life. I blame the parents, they got no idea of how to bring kids up these days, they let them have their own way too much, where have the days gone when a parent said no and meant it. <br>  It's a chav society!!|`|tGgLhOIGaa	Why wouldnt you is more like the question?<br>  If you let her have one done then whats wrong with two?<br>  ive had two piercings in each ear since i was 9 also and it made no difference to anything else apart from the fact i had two instead of one holes in my ears!|`|qR9RDSEEaa	why not?<br>  my mum let me have my belly button pierced when i was 12..<br>  im now 14 and just got my nose pierced.<br>  no harm, if you dont like it or if she doesnt then you can always<br>  take it out and let it grow over|`|wObmwK1uaa	of course i would let her, if she wants it done it her choice at the end of the day and she will get it done with or without your consent once she is old enough.|`|JDsgCDGUaa	One in each ear is ok at that age two might be going a bit far<br>  Wait a bit longer ... maybe at 14+ two might be alright<br>   I have two but i wouldn't advise doing it at a young age ... most schools wont allow that any way|`|TrBoPj92aa	no, defiantly not, thats too grown up seriously, my 9 yr old has asked to get her 1st piercing and i told her she could get it for her 10th birthday in June|`|mmpxd5Ouaa	I personally would not allow a 9 year old to have any part of her body mutilated.|`|ftIUXfK7aa	Who would? It is a human being, not a wall to be decorated. It would be tantamount to child abuse|`|p28hM9ZGaa	No chance, I wouldnt let my 13yr old have it done, it looks cheap and like you dont care. Far too young sorry.|`|i4I0cuudaa	absolutely not.  a 9 year old is not old enough to make such a decision|`|p07RwZK2aa	no way. <br>  I wouldn't even let them have one hole in each ear! <br>  My girls have to wait until they are 12.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	No.|`|xprwl2Cpaa	No.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	not even one|`|97a3edb1673f5a9aa6130e230c75fc1faa	i would let her/him do that. it's her/his ears after all and her/his life and body.|`|kLlA2JTjaa	9?! Maybe 13+ is ok, but 9 is way too young lol<br>  <br>  And this is from a 14 year old!|`|uP08b6K4aa	Although my daughter had her ears pierced at an early age, I would personally feel that having two is too much at 9yrs old.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I wouldn't let a 9 year old have one hole pierced in each ear. My daughter doesn't need chunks of metal poked through her earlobes to look gorgeous.|`|O8XjkCjxaa	Definitely not, not even one in each ear.<br>  <br>  Earrings are there to make girls look beautiful and older; and I would like my 9 year old little girl to be a 9 year old little girl. At 9 years old, you shouldn't be worrying about how you look, you should be worrying about rain and not being able to draw on the pavement with chalk.<br>  <br>  I didn't get my ears pierced til I was 14.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	nope, our kids grow up too fast as it is, there is no need to put extra emphasis on their looks, they will have enough of that later in life. ( and it DOES look trashy, as some other members said)|`|AA10077992	By all means ! Tell her she can have it done for b/day/Easter/good test results etc - whichever is the farthest away ! <br>  Being a young lady - she may well change her mind !|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	when my daughter was 13 she wanted her lip pierced so i told her if she still wanted it done at 16 i would consider it, shes 17 now and forgot all about it lol.
6nn7f41Faa	I think Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are much better.|`|VHHis05Naa	Nope.|`|VGij9p0Taa	Good names if you want your children to be bullied!<br>  If you don't their every bad names extremely bad the taunts they would get if they were called those names goodness. Maybe Jackson & Jillian not Jack and Jill. <br>  Suggestions:- <br>  Clara & Cole <br>  Katrina & Kennedy <br>  Willow & William <br>  Lily & Samuel <br>  Hope this helped.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	No - it's much safer if kids with the same birthday and surname have different initials. It makes it that much less likely that their medical records will get confused in an emergency.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Jackson "Jack" & Jillian "Jill" is cuter|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	although i like the names. Please save your kids from teasing.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	They would be picked on so badly|`|coVZ1uqCaa	It would be cute, but your children might be teased during their school years.<br>  Maybe it could be "Jackson" & "Jillian" ? <br>  I think that would be a cute set of twin names.<br>  Plus, you can call them Jack & Jill for short. <br>  <br>  Edit : Here are some suggestions --<br>  Alec & Alexa.<br>  Christian & Christa.<br>  Elijah & Elaina.<br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  -----|`|hrRh0CqNaa	It think you should go with Jackson/Jaxon and Jillian so that when they get older, they can kinda stray away from the "story". If they'd like. they can make it a little less obvious about the nursery rhyme aspect. But, I do like the names, though. . .|`|ozATw7s0aa	No, but I knew a family who had maybe 7 kids, and the two youngest were named Jack and Jillian. They weren't twins, but they were cute :)|`|B0adEY4Kaa	no,its awful . sorry your  twins would be teased. i like the name jack though|`|8DF64P7Gaa	I think its cute.

j2mRop0laa	My oldest will go to college if I have to drag her kicking and screaming. She loves expensive things and knows more about name brand designers than Paris Hilton. I will not be stuck with that credit card bill when she's an adult and she will get an amazing career if it kills me.<br>  <br>  My youngest. I don't know. I'm lucky to get her through first grade. She can't stand school and I don't know if I need to home school her not, but I have no clue if she'll make it to a regular college. I would be happy if she makes it to a trade school or online college program etc. She wants to be a pop star so I'm hoping that works out for her. :)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i dont know if you can "make" your child go to college.  i do however, think that is something that i will strongly encourage and make clear the importance of it.  i'm a wonderful example of what not to do for my kids in that regard.  hopefully, i can be the correct example of what to do here in the next few years.  <br>  i dont know that the seed is enough.  black and white facts are pretty useful - college graduates make X amount per year more than noncollege graduates.  a degree is something that can never be taken from you and will have value.|`|P544Sbmqaa	I would strongly encourage it.  However, forcing your children to go to school when they dont want to is pointless.  They wont learn, skip more classes than they attend and you will just be wasting your money.  However, if they are still living with me at that point, they had best be doing something...  working, school, volunteering..  As long as its something productive.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I will encourage her to take every chance she gets to blossom in life. But weather she sees a different way to blossom then I do, then it is up to her to make that decision|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Maybe a little bit of both---kinda like having a garden and wanting it to flourish; I will plant the seed and then as the years progress I will water it and see how it grows. I want the kids to be everything they can be and I think that College or University is/would be great especially with the way things are changing in 2009...I think the best defense is a good education so they can really go somewhere and accomplish good things in life.<br>  <br>  My parents were anal about college but never really helped me get there and on my own I never tried cause I *never thought I would make it. I will certainly encourage it and save money for them as well...|`|AA12145826	I will strongly encourage her to seek additional education beyond college (how's that for a work around?? LoL). I work for a company where I see that a strong technical education background is almost as, if not more so, important than a college degree. In fact the technical sector is strongly lacking in properly educated people. Our machine shop ONLY hires people with a technical education AND experience because they need to know how to program the machines as well as run them.|`|eISzHe5maa	This is coming from a teenager, not a parent. I'm never forced to go to college or get ready for college or anything along the lines of that. I've been strongly encouraged by my mother but that's it. My mom doesn't want to have to make me do something like this only to waste all that money she could have used to buy her a plane ticket back to Germany and a place to live. <br>  <br>  I want to go to college though. I have high hopes and dreams and I plan to do whatever it takes. My mom believes in my hopes and dreams and if I have enough motivation and ambition she'd always help me. College has always been a top priority on my list because I want to be successful and going to college is so necessary for that to happen.<br>  <br>  So I guess her encouraging worked. Besides she said that if I wasn't going to college I'd have to get my own job and move out of this place....I like the college option much better.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I will encourage them, but I will not force them.<br>  <br>  The seed is planted, though.  We homeschool, and our children look at learning and education as a lifelong process-not something that takes place in certain buildings or between certain ages.<br>  <br>  My oldest is 11, and has her plan in place-she wants to be a veterinarian, which requires a lot of further education.

Hopefully they'll see that by the time they start college, they'll need a college education to flip burgers at McPuke's, but want more for themselves and use that money to achieve something greater.<br>  <br>  We've also both left 25% each of our life insurance to both of them to help get them out of debt if what they have in their RESP's is not enough to cover all of their schooling.|`|GwWDnvB8aa	When our kids are young, it's easy to imagine that we will have the power to make them do what we want with regard to college or other things as they get older. But, the fact is that there is no way we can force another adult to do anything. As much as we'd like our children to attend college, when a 6' tall, 180 lb man informs mom that he will not attend college, there's not much mom can do. We can't lift them into the car, strap them in, drive them to college, and attend each class with them to force them to go. We can only encourage them and then be there for them as they make their own, adult decisions.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	No I wouldn't make my kids go to college... I would plant a seed and encourage them to go, and set up the financial means through saving for them to go.  <br>  <br>  The reason for this, is I had no real want or needs to go to college out of high school, I jumped and joined the work force, made good friends, had a load of experiences I couldn't have had doing anything else.  I ended up working for an airline that allowed me free flights on standby.  Only when I got in a rut at work, did I realize that I wanted to go back to school, and did so.   So I ended up starting school college at 25 instead of 18, which in the end worked out best.  I had no interest in school at first, but my father had planted the seed, encouraged strongly, and then once I had decided to go he helped me look for schools and is covering the cost of it... but he never forced me to go, so it ended up with my getting a degree I wanted.<br>  <br>  Therefore I will do the same.|`|yxtMLgN8aa	I'd encourage them to. It depends on what they want to do for a living. Heck, I still can't figure out what I want to do and I'm turning 22. I'm taking a break from college now so I'm not wasting anymore money on classes I may not need. I may not even need to go to college depending on what I decide. I may not even have to work. I'm not working now because I'm pregnant and we decided for me to be a stay at home mom for the first years of our child's life. I'm totally fine with that. But I do like knowing if I change my mind, I have some background with college classes behind me. I want them to see the benefits of going to school.|`|kM3t3iDsaa	Yes I will be, my Beautiful.<br>  <br>  College here is year 11 & 12. I think that my State passed, or is passing laws, so that they must attend year 11, not sure about 12.<br>  <br>  Of cause they could drop out, and get a trade, but I will be pushing Education very passionately.|`|jxIt38qnaa	It really should be their own choice, you cannot force them to go to college.   College is not for everybody either.  But, wouldn't let them turn out to be a complete miserable failure and not have a normal life.  Maybe, encourage.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	make them.  or at least as close as I can get with a legal adult.  obviously i can't really make them.  but i sure will do my best.<br>  <br>  it's nearly as important to me as making sure they look both ways before crossing the street.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I'm going to encourage her strongly, but be supportive of whatever decision she makes. The wonderful thing about college, is that you can go at any age.<br>  <br>  I didn't go right away, I took a year off and worked. Once I realized how little money I was making working so much just to live, I enrolled and eventually graduated early.

p11HaDIWaa	wow lucky u, don't worry everyone's pregnancy is different. me and my neighbor are both pregnant and i was sooooo sick and felt terrible the first 4 months and was always cranky from being so sick and miserable and she had absolutely no problems and is still working to this day and is always happy and bubbly. when i used to see her early in the morning she would always be so cheerful it would just piss me off lol good luck to u:)|`|ROJans2Taa	im sure your fine, with my first I was 16 and lived off of mcds and pizza hut,lol. didn't even know I was pregnant till roughly 3 mths in. with my second I was eating alot healthier but had bad cramps and bleeding till 11 weeks, he is 6 mths now. it was actually in my second trimester I got nausea, it was due to low blood pressure, I was also really dizzy and lightheaded. I really think you'll do fine, best luck|`|85V6cHe4aa	Some women dont have any symptoms at all and it doesnt mean anything is wrong,i never had a single symptom with my first and i had a healthy baby.<br>  <br>  Eating at those places wont cause a miscarriage either,|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Ummmm...not everyone experiences the same symptoms...and not all at the same time either.  I didn't get morning sickness until I was about 12 weeks.  Other than that, I just had to pee all the time...from day 1.  Unless u are bleeding bright red blood...I wouln't stress.  Fast food does not equal miscarriage....i|`|GjuRYsITaa	once you get to 3 months allot of the pregnancy symptoms go i haven't really had any the whole pregnancy just starting to get the heart burn now 29 weeks im sure you will be fine|`|Lmiu6oBHaa	Not everyone gets symptons, Im sure you will be fine =)|`|Q8tf4B5taa	There is no need to worry if you haven't had any bleeding then you are fine. I am on my third and with all 3 have had the same symptoms you are describing. You are going in to your second trimester which means your baby is starting to move up and your hormones are settling ( which can cause women to urinate more in early pregnancy) Even the tiniest bit of sickness you have been feeling will start to disappear. You second trimester is the best when you bloom and get your energy back enjoy it good luck!!|`|n08phNeOaa	My symptoms have been also almost non-existent, some nausea some times, but not vomiting. Cramps are probably there because your uterus is getting bigger as the baby grows. I don't think what you ate in first month could be so much important. I also took coffee and sodas quite a bit ate at McDonald's, kebab places, frozen pizzas and so on. Nothing happened. I think you might be just overly worried. But what you can do just for calming yourself is to take another pregnancy test, if HCG-test shows still positive you have absolutely nothing to worry about. Good luck!|`|okwH1iTyaa	I have had all those symptoms and have 3 healthy kids.  I am certain that eating fast food would not cause you to miscarry.  I craved it a lot when I was pregnant.  If you are still having any concerns, please call your doctor to have him/her reassure you. That is what they are there for.<br>  Good Luck!!  :o)

uwCcIY8Aaa	well if you have had three successful pregnancies and one bad one, it's alright. just keep trying. try speaking to your doctor to find out why the miscarriage happened and what you could do to prevent it. hope this helps! good luck! (:|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Yes,just keep trying...A miscarriage is just a way the Lord takes what we love from us due to something being wrong with it...My wife had 3 already...Now I have 2 wonderful children from never giving up on hope..|`|jNGdtQDSaa	yeah of course, the probability of becoming infertile after a miscarriage isn't that high although it will most likely make it harder. but you should go see your doctor! they know better than the internet :P|`|nhkvvHFKaa	I think so my mom got pregnant a the age of 42 last summer. Unfortunately, she had a misscarriage too only three months after conception. I think that if you get pregnant again you should try to be extra careful and take a lot of vitamins. My mother has problems with anemia now so I think that could have been a contributing factor. Talk to your doctor about your current health and what measures you might be able to take to help you to have another baby. Good luck, I hope this helps.|`|HxK8Cteoaa	YES! Just because you had one bad pregnancydoes not mean you will have another one.You have had three sucessful ones and  you can try again.There will be no harm done.But I do think if you have another misscarriage you should check in with your doctor before trying again.|`|DBYyiHyCaa	sure
SHXvUSd4aa	i think you mean "pregnancy SIGNS", not "SIGHS"<br>  <br>  woman ovulates in the midlde of her cylce (day 13-16), so nothign much happens until you miss the next period (day 26-320, AND EVEN THEN YOU MAY NOT FEEL ANYTHIGN FOR ANOTHER WEEKOR SO.|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	give it a week|`|2UNBPcxTaa	maybe  5 days|`|pJhT9GjFaa	It's difficult to say exactly how long it will take to get pregnant. However, these general statistics may give you an idea of how long it will take. Normally fertile couples have a 20 to 30 per cent chance of getting pregnant each cycle. About 84 per cent of couples in the general population will conceive within one year if they have unprotected, regular sex, and half of the remainder will conceive naturally within the following year, if they keep trying. This means that while some couples will get pregnant in the first month of trying, for other couples it may take at a couple of years before they conceive. Even then, some healthy couples can take even longer to get pregnant.|`|weBOR9YCaa	I ovulated somewhere b/t 3/1 and 3/2. We bd the Tuesday and Wednesday and Saturday b4 ov. on 3/1 and 3/2. the days following I had lower back pains  and cramping. on 3/5 I had what I think is implantation bleeding af is supposed to come 3/14, but now I don't have any signs.

Becuase when i tought i was pregnant the test said positive but when i went to the doctor they said i wasnt.  the test dont always work
ZbnxGIsnaa	When you ovulate your cervix moves upwards and is very high and soft.  After you ovulate your cervix will move back down and become hard like how it will be on your period.  It feels like the end of your nose.  If you are pregnant it will move back upwards again and it will be soft like your lip.
dnG7fhnbaa	Lol, gotta agree with you on that one mate. I think the classic one though is "How do I do it?"  Haha.<br>  <br>  Oh!

You cant say they aren't ready for sex!! <br>  Its just nice to have more opinions on your situation!! They probably know the 'birds and bees' just want to know what others think.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	Thank you! <br>  Great, smart person!<br>  It is kind of stating the obvious, NO teen at all is ready for sex, but my word, it needs saying on this section!<br>  "I didn't use a condom because my boyfriend said he would pull out!" Idiocy!|`|ozATw7s0aa	Yes,<br>  <br>  That's why they are asking.<br>  <br>  yahoo ANSWERS.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	No teens anywhere are really ready for it.  <br>  <br>  Parents should be making sure their teens have 100% supervision.  If they could do it from birth to 10 years old or whatever, it can be done up until 18.<br>  <br>  I know parents who are doing just that, and it works great.  They also aren't stupid enough to let their son/daughter go to the bedroom with their bf/gf.  Everything they do is done out in the open under the watchful eyes of the parents.|`|wObmwK1uaa	why do teenagers get criticised so much for, this makes me so angry i'm only 17 but talk a lot of sense so why not listen, yeah some questions they ask are stupid but most of them are afraid scared and need help as they can't talk to anyone else so instead of having a go at them why not try and help them by answering their questions, not with the first answer that comes into your head but take some time to read the stories and find out how they are feeling have some consideration!|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Yeah. I saw a question yesterday, and the asker wanted to know what protection to use, because he wanted to have sex. Obviously, if he was asking what protection to use, he wasn't ready for sex. It was insane. Ha.|`|8dpZpH0Saa	I know! You want to know if your pregnant. Go to the store and buy a damn pregnancy test. Or...don't have sex if you aren't ready to have the responsibilities of a child.|`|6lSbmXunaa	Teens aren't ready for sex. Period.<br>  <br>  It's kind of sad looking at some of the questions. Why would 13, 14, and 15 year olds have sex in the first place?|`|rOfFOcwpaa	It's not just this section, no teen in the universe is ready for sex.|`|EqPWmRdBaa	Good point.<br>  Stupid kids these days.|`|yY6qTloXaa	haha good point. :)|`|bVfzC8LMaa	Just because the teens that ask STUPID questions in this section don't seem and probably aren't ready for sex doesn't mean that ALL teens are this way. you can't take a group of teens and assume that all teens are the same way, that's stereotyping, <br>  I don't believe parents should watch their kids 24/7, it's going to end up WORSE because they are going to break free, and do whatever they couldn't do before. <br>  Adults piss me off, they act like they know everything because they were there or because they have kids, because they're smarter and have been through s.h.it no, the generation has changed and its a whole lot different, <br>  we are smarter then you when you were teens, <br>  our minds are more developed then you guys think they are, and you shouldn't think we are all stupid and think the same, <br>  i'm 15, i don't post in here asking if i can use 2 condoms at once, or if i can have unprotected sex on birth control, <br>  i know what you shouldn't do, and what you should do.<br>  <br>  so don't go around stereotyping all teens to be the same. <br>  <br>  and sex is a PERSONAL choice, your supposed to have it when YOU are ready, when YOU know all the facts and won't end up pregnant and  alone because the baby daddy left your a.s.s. no one has the right to try and stop a teen from doing what they choose.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Almost no teen anywhere is ready for sex. It's not just in this section.|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	I agree! A whole lot of teens here are dumb. Sheba, (thats what you wee called, right?)  I do agree with you and the person above you that teens are never ready for sex, but I disagree that teens (or children!) should be watched 24/7. They need privacy just as much as adults do. And letting your daughter/son up to the bedroom is completely fine. Just as long as you check them every 20 minutes or so. And besides, teens would never DARE try have sex while their parents are in the house.
aPrkTQByaa	I really like the name Jacqueline. Like you said I also would see it as fashion's icon type of name. When i think of the name Jacqueline I think of a classy young woman working for like a modeling agency or being a wonderful hair style person. I know a girl name Jacqueline and she is a hair styling person, she can sing, and she is also very pretty... I listed some middle names that I think would go great with the name Jacqueline.<br>  -Leigh<br>  -Grace (My Favorite!!)<br>  <br>  Congrats And I Hope I helped!!! <br>  <br>  Jd Girl :<)|`|orqYxrm6aa	It is my mums name! So I have to love it really! I think it is a sweet name, and recently at my school I have met a few Jacquelines, but they spell their name in a more modern way, eg.:<br>  <br>  Jacclyn<br>  Jacileyn<br>  <br>  And I think that is cuter! So yeah, Jacqueline rocks!|`|5pAVY0SWaa	I find this name VERY common in Australia.  And it always gets short formed.

It reminds me of Jack-o-latern!|`|dK6YGyNyaa	Someone in my family is called Jacqueline, I think it's a really nice name, and can be nicknamed to make it more child-friendly for her childhood, e.g.<br>  Jacqui<br>  Jax<br>  J<br>  <br>  then she can use the full name when she gets a bit older. Good choice.|`|U1h6Dntjaa	I think it sounds very dated.  It makes me think of a woman in her 50s.  I would go with something either more classic or more modern.  This one is just old-lady-esque.|`|ozATw7s0aa	No, sorry. It reminds me of this very solitary girl in my grade who plays World Of Warcraft and has no sense of humor :(|`|SIhEme03aa	I like it! Its my mom's name. Although its kind of hard to find a middle name to go with it.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	I really like this name. Ive always liked it even since i was little, its my cousins middle name and i was always so jealous haha. However, i prefer the whole name over the nicknames like Jackie, Jacqueline is a beautiful just plain!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I like it a lot. It isn't common but is a classic name and I find it quite pretty.

NBOBMQwdaa	Lyla, or even Lila (I actually like the spelling Lila the best) would look nice.

OZ474DMYaa	you can check your local newspapers. A lot of people do like in home day cares and those are a lot cheaper than a regular one. I would think the only free child care may be with a family member. I could be wrong though. You could also check local churches and see if they have anything available. I used to live in West Lafayette, IN and I know that when I lived there I would take care of kids at their homes and it would be a lot cheaper for the parents. GL.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	look up <br>  CCIS <br>  we have it here in PA it is a goverment funded program and u pay 5 dollars a week <br>  <br>  or look for church based daycares <br>  <br>  we have something called moms house that helps with baby stuff and has free daycare|`|rjVALevtaa	Check with your local health department and they will most likely be able to point you in the right direction.

TrTfowAQaa	I'm so sorry to say that you have to wait save your money on the HPT's til you miss your period I was 3 weeks late before I took a test & there was no doubt. so just wait 14 days and take a test. no way to know before a baby is far enough along to have all the hormones in your body...good luck|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	You can get pregnant just from having sex once, and he doesn't even have to ejaculate in you for you to become pregnant. So yes, it's definitely enough sex for you to be able to get pregnant. If you think you might be then you need to either take a HPT (home pregnancy test) or go to the Dr's to get tested.|`|0DtWgXxUaa	You don't just ovulate for one day. You ovulate approx. 2-3 days each side too, just not as much.<br>  Yes, this is DEFINATELY enough.<br>  Sorry, you can't find out yet though. Be patient!|`|Q8tf4B5taa	yes it is enough it only takes the once.|`|452l3uU8aa	no matter what day you have sex, there is always a possibility you will become pregnant.

Anything up to a year of trying for a baby is normal.
iTXnHiwTaa	I got some brown discharge too. I also bought the really expensive kind of pregnancy test and tried it the day after my period was due and it came back negative (this brand claims to give you results as soon as 4 days before your period.) Well, I was pregnant with twins which means elevated hormonal levels and it still came out wrong the first couple of times but I kept trying cuz I 'just knew" and a week later, I found out I was pregnant! Good luck!!!!|`|y4TKXkbuaa	This can sometimes happen and if often called an "implantation bleed" as long as theres no cramping, pains, or fresh red blood im sure your be ok. est get checked out by your Gp first. Have you done the obvious of a pregnancy test? The Clear Blue digital ones can now tll you approximatley how many weeks pregnant you are. First response is also a good reliable test to use too.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the very best and hope the future is positive for you and your family<br>  <br>  Take care x|`|1G97OBNEaa	I had brown discharge when I got pregnant...so it could be a sign but not necessarily,  Good Luck to you!|`|DiNZ0Joraa	I took a cheap brand prego test  the day after I ws due for my period... and it showed up negative right away, then when I went to throw it away five minutes later there was a faint positive line. SO I suggest you re-check your tests! I did by an expensive one after that experienc and the same thing happened. I never experienced brown discharge.... but in the beginning I just felt like I was going to get my period, but I never did. My breast swelled up like they usually did before my visitor... but they appeared my vainy and my nipples were darker.... and honestly I "Just Knew" something was different. Hope I helped! Good luck! and have fun with mommyhood!!! and enjoy your free time while you can! lol|`|vJEatJFPaa	I never had any bloody discharge but I guess its common for some woman when they conceive. Good Luck!|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	This could be implementation bleeding. I had this with my first son but not my second. The tests you used may not have picked up the pregnancy hormone or that there was a faint positive that you just missed. The best thing is the blood work to confirm. Since you are 3 weeks late though with a bit of blood this is a good sign for you. You may feel like cramping like your period is coming on but it doesn't. All the best to you and "baby dust" is sent your way!

Beatles or Punk.|`|pcjOQDymaa	idk but a time where i could go in the wild and go on adventures.<br>  maybe the 1800's or 1900's?<br>  idk|`|H0sPCJQPaa	The 60's <br>  I love the movie Hairspray. That would be soo cool.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Colonial times, LOL. I think it would be so cool!<br>  <br>  Or the 70's. That would be awesome :D|`|2H6j4j8taa	I'd love to be between 17-25 during the 1920's.|`|qcjAg3yOaa	I was born in 87 so im pretty content with that... I have memories from back when I was 3 so im a total 90's girl... I was a teen in the 2000's though,. I miss the 90s though.. its crazy.. being a teenager passes by so damn fast. Its like you turn 15 then you count down to get your license then you count down to get your job then to get outta HS and then bam... Teenage life is over.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	I think I would have liked to have been born in 1988, so I'd be around 21 now. I agree, the nineties did rock!|`|6665pCRRaa	Either the 60's or the 90's.
8jBGhsWPaa	First of all why is everyone on here bringing up her ages!! <br>  she is 16 if she wants to have sex then why is that big deal she is legal to do it so stop criticising her for it! I'm 16 and Ive been with my boyfriend 2 years and we have sex.. what makes us any different GRRR sorry that annoys me.<br>  <br>  Now.. There is always that chance you're pregnant and I understand this is very scary and emotional for you but relax. Buy another pregnancy test or go to your doctor and have him do it for you. And sit with it and await your results after 2-5 minutes it should appear negative or positive.. If it is positive remain calm and talk to your mum. Its great you told your mum because you have someone to talk to!  decide what you want to do and go from there..<br>  good luck babe x|`|AA12069058	Theres a 50/50 chance you could be pregnant. It sounds like your NOT. Besides a test is not accurate after 10 minutes anyways, so your "faint positive" means nothing. Just buy another test and do it first thing in the morning. That is when your urine is more likely to show the pregnancy hormone. Good Luck?|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	If you wait for 2 hours the test is no longer valid.  If you had a period it's unlikely you are pregnant.|`|wObmwK1uaa	you may be feeling like you are about to have your period as when you are pregnant you get pains still that feel like period pains, when i took my pregnancy test it came back positive and when i checked 5 hours later the positive lines where still there. the best time to do a pregnancy test is your first wee of the morning. ive just read your additional details and i hate people who criticise you because of your age, im only 17 and pregnant if you want to be pregnant then i wish you all the luck in the world x|`|wy5SiCS2aa	ok, I'm sure  you know what you did was irresponsible. So there's no sense in dwelling on that.  There is always always the chance that you will get pregnant even when you take the pill! (I'm a birth control pill baby)Especially when you skip two pills, there is a good chance you are pregnant. Why did you let the test sit so long, how could you forget about something so important? Wait a day or so, take another test with your first morning urine, and sit there and wait for the result! It's only 5 minutes out of your life!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I think what you have had is an evaporation line. Tests aren't reliable after ten minutes in most instances so you shouldn't worry too much.<br>  <br>  You should buy a clear blue digital, they are pricey but when you see pregnant or not pregnant in front of you, you can be sure of the answer.|`|758cDKEFaa	didnt you ask this the other day?<br>  surely if your mum knows she would have took you to the doctor and had a proper test done there.<br>  i got pregnant with my first at 15 and im 18 and pregnant with my second after missing to pills.<br>  see a doctor, if you are pregnant you will ahve to see them anyway to get it confirmed!|`|zrO4h1hqaa	im sure you still go to a pediatrician for a doctor and he might give you a pregnancy test but i would go to a special doctor and go never trust the ones you buy at c.v.s or Walgreen uf you are don't get an abortion. and the best of luck|`|dT8tbGrLaa	Yes it is possible that you could be pregnant, i suggest testing right away and drinking lots of fluids so there is no source of error.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	Girl, just go to the doctor. And use CONDOMS next time. <br>  <br>  "No condoms, no sex." Repeat after me....|`|O8Kf27TSaa	Go to the doctor just incase i guess?<br>  And why are you having sex at age of 16?! Check again|`|GsSRY7quaa	first calm down. second, tell your mom, third, go to the doctor and have them do the test over.|`|peybb4Foaa	Do the test again. If its still positive then your ffed.<br>  <br>  Really why didnt you use protection?<br>  If you have sex  then at least use some protection.<br>  <br>  One my friend  was a dad at  16. That guy worked  24/7 to get money ( not easy for a  16 year old with so small education) <br>  And ended up an  drug user " to stop the stress"<br>  <br>  <br>  Theres nothing else you can do than wait and go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Dont think about your boyfriend when he asks for unprotected sex, think about the kid who may come out of it or the abortion.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	I would suggest not having sex anymore since you are not ready to handle the consequences of "accidents".  Birth control does fail at times, even when used correctly.  <br>  <br>  As for what to do, take the test again.  Get a job, make the boyfriend get a job and work your hind ends off to support this kid so taxpayers won't have to support this one.|`|kcYRr7FAaa	Just Relax, by stressing it puts your period off longer because your levels are all off balence.. thats number 1 and number 2 i would take another test and/ or go see a doctor because if you are indeed pregnant you need to take pre-natal precautions and what nott!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Kw4zqfu0aa	Yes, you should get tested again, just in case. But the faint positive line after 2 hours does not mean anything. Buy another test and test with the first urine of the day. Good luck!|`|5BNT5s1Yaa	There's no such thing as a false positive when it comes to home pregnancy tests.<br>  <br>  Take another test in a couple days.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SmXDEMPraa	Just re-do the test but make sure you do it right then if it says positive you need to go to a doctor.|`|8309f9cbff94401c9a0602e4bbb11f22aa	What the hell are you doing having sex at 16?<br>  Unreal the kids of today.|`|UlAMJuD7aa	Do the test again !<br>  You might be.|`|xoobWcWxaa	go to a doctor get it checked out <br>  my friend was just like this and she was preg.|`|e2NKXhoOaa	WHY DID YOU HAVE SEX AT THAT AGE? go to the doctor and see you have to be careful of what your doing|`|AA12071759	Definitely take a home test again or go to see a doctor.  You won't know for sure until you're tested again or get your period, right? It's hard to say you're pregnant for sure because you are so young so it isn't uncommon for you to miss periods, however, usually a line on a pregnancy test, even if faint, is a positive. Though you did read it wrong. Perhaps you should see a doctor, go to the walk-in or emerg, because if you ARE pregnant you can take the next steps immediately instead of finding out at home and then having to see a doctor.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	think about the "morning after" pill<br>  The morning-after pill — a form of emergency birth control — is used to prevent a woman from becoming pregnant after she has had unprotected vaginal intercourse. Morning-after pills are generally considered safe, but many women are unaware that they exist.<br>  <br>  Here's how the morning-after pill works. Human conception rarely occurs immediately after intercourse. Instead, it occurs as long as several days later, after ovulation. During the time between intercourse and conception, sperm continue to travel through the fallopian tube until the egg appears. So taking emergency birth control the "morning after" isn't too late to prevent pregnancy.|`|mSJwKrQIaa	Heyy. Dont worry, the first thing to do is calm down. You did the right thing by telling your mum. My advice would be to takethe test again. You can get a false negative if there isn't enough progesterone in your blood. But you can't get a false positive. (:<br>  I know i've missed the pill a couple of times. You didn't do it on purpose. The important thing is that you learn from your mistakes.<br>  Go and buy another test and read the instructions carefully. <br>  No one should jude you. Yeah, you didn't use a condom, but I can guarantee that everyone has done that one time or another. Just remember to make him wear one next time. :)<br>  If the test comes out negative, there's nothing to worry about. If it comes back positive, then the first thing to do is make an appointment with your doctor. Then take it from there. You have options. <br>  <br>  Good Luck. (;<br>  <br>  Yasmine <3|`|C4ibOR7Laa	you took a test and forgot to see if it was positive or negative??<br>  <br>  get another test, a digital one this time, they can be left up to 24hours to check and the result will not change

uP08b6K4aa	Yes there's every chance her body is gearing up for the big change and it's no easy transition for girls no matter what they're age I'm afraid.<br>  <br>  You however sound like an extremely supportive parent who has obviously explained everything to her and made sure she has the things she needs for when the big day comes.<br>  <br>  All you can do now is wait and try to take her moods with a pinch of salt and make sure she's as comfortable as possible.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you both x|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Not necessarily. My daughter's been like that on and off for a couple of years. She's nearly 13 and still hasn't started.|`|AA10034285	Yes, it seems as if she may be about to start.<br>  <br>  It is usually a good idea to have a first period party arranged in advance, to which she can invite her friends, to celebrate the fact of her becoming a woman. Girls of her age enjoy that sort of thing nowadays.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Could be, I started mine on my 11th b-day. I don't remember going through mood swings though. But then again I never experienced PMS mood swings until I was in my mid 30's. <br>  Just continue to monitor her and keep the lines of communication open.

For some reason, I was embarrased about being bullied and didn't want everyone knowing.<br>  I'm NOT saying that this is what's happening here - but I'v never had period cramps so bad that they've brought me to tears, although my sister does get them that bad and always has.<br>  If she is moody and sensitive due to hormones etc, she may be crying for another reason - just keep an eye out.<br>  I hope I'm not making you paranoid, this is very likely not happening, but I really wish someone would have investigated further into why I kept crying.|`|AA10877025	gently tell her about periods she's at the age where she'll start them soon and it will help explain her pains and she won't be as frightened when they do start.please tell her or she could think it's something seriously wrong with her.|`|TrBoPj92aa	yeah probably its good then she's being so open with you just be supportive and keep giving her hugs your doing the right thing good luck x|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	sounds like it is starting keep an eye on the mood swings and crying it might be depression|`|XgyHPhMzaa	mine started at 10|`|mwW4zIwIaa	I don't know...<br>  It might be some problems at school, but she's keeping it in herself? I use to do that a lot, and cried a lot as well. Stress can also cause stomach pains or headaches.<br>  <br>  EDIT: A lot of parents don't know their children as well as they think. My mom didn't doubt me when I lied, and tried to cover up for why I'm crying. Kids keep a lot inside themselves more than you think... Even if that's not the case, you should always keep an eye out.
b8f0CfSsaa	Breastfeeding can be a little sore, but it doesn't hurt too much. <br>  <br>  Expressing in to a bottle is fine. Your baby will be getting breast milk and in many ways expressing can bring benefits, i.e you can hand your baby over to someone whilst you nap, if you are ill you can use previously stored breast milk, you build a supply for emergencies etc etc.|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Honestly, I didn't think breastfeeding hurt at all. I've heard stories of it being painful but I didn't experience that. I thought the worst was just getting your milk supply established. After that is was a breeze. <br>  You can give your milk to the baby in a bottle. I always made sure mine had some out of a bottle so they could get used to the different nipples. After all you might want to go out one night and leave the baby with grandparents or something. In a case like that you'll need a bottle.<br>  As long as it's breast milk I think it is breastfeeding. I will tell you this, in the middle of the night it's alot easier to just whip out the boob instead of fooling with a bottle.lol<br>  Good luck!|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Well as Graham's mama pointed out expressed milk isn't as good as fresh, unless freshly expressed. And that's just super hard to do. Of course expressed milk is better than formula, but breastmilk is a live substance that does start to break down, especially after being frozen/reheated. (Sorry if the truth offends). Pumping is also a lot harder to maintain than bfing itself. (Ask working moms!) <br>  <br>  If you give breastfeeding 6 weeks you'll be over the pain and into the easy. No bottles, no heating, no bringing even more stuff for outings... much more convenient ime. <br>  <br>  GL!|`|MeYILJeSaa	Well breastmilk from the bottle is NOT exactly the same as straight from the breast. But it's still better than formula, of course. Your breastmilk changes throughout the day to meet your child's needs. And if you get sick, your milk starts making extra antibodies so your baby doesn't get sick. The pumped milk in containers aren't going to know to do that. <br>  Here is some info about the differences between milk straight from the breast and pumped milk. <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/lipase-expressedmilk.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/lipas...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkstorage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milks...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/immunefactors.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/i...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks for the thumbs down even though I'm giving correct info!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Breastfeeding doesn't just make their poo not stinky, there is loads of other benefits to breastfeeding your child.<br>  <br>  Expressing your milk into a bottle is just the same as breastfeeding, your baby will get all the benefits from your milk, but you're just pumping the milk from your breasts into bottles.<br>  <br>  Your breasts and nipples will still hurt this way for a few weeks until you're used to it, then it'll be easier. Your boobs will still become engorged with milk every few hours this way too.|`|9104bb285d8b87b92fe87a09510fdbfdaa	ok firstly Breastfeeding Doesn't hurt!... you might get sore nipple in the beginning, for a few days at most, BUT if you are nursing properly it will not hurt, I nursed for 14 months with my last child and am currently (hoping to) go into labour with my 6th child all of which I nursed for some length of time.<br>  When you are pumping, your still bottle feeding but you giving your child breast milk instead of formula, BUT if you do this too soon you can give your baby nipple confusion and actually make direct nursing more difficult, I would also leave out the Dummy for the first few weeks while nursing is being established.|`|wxImZRssaa	Breast feeding only hurts if you do it wrong. Personally I was doing it wrong for the first day or two. That made my nipples sore. Then feeding was painful for about ten days. After that it didn't hurt at all.<br>  <br>  I tried to express milk but I couldn't get anything out. Its especially difficult to express in the first weeks, so you will probably have to feed straight from the breast at first.<br>  <br>  Have your midwife show you how to do it properly.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	That is just like breastfeeding.. the point is for the baby to have your milk which is better for them. Doesn't matter if they get it directly from you or from you via bottle.
EHY3FnAmaa	Ryan is the same way. He freaks out in the back seat when it's dark. We bought one of the Fisherprice Rainforest miirrors for the car and the animals light up and sing. This has seemed to help. Yet sometimes he is still scared  =/|`|LUjCnYmoaa	Im not sure if its the dark that hes scared of, but maybe just uncomfortable in the seat, it could also be the fact that he cant see anyone and its a bit of separation anxiety, i know our little guy is going through that now, so the fact that he can't see you because its dark could be a factor.|`|njWgBfX6aa	yup hell grow out of it im sure
ZbnxGIsnaa	You could be dear!!! =)  Yes, wait a few more days to test as the hcg doubles every 2 days.  "Supposedly."  Not really in my case, but it's usually the norm for most people!  Haha.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you had implantation bleeding to me!  I am actually almost 6 weeks pregnant and your boobs will hurt dear.  Especially your nipples.  I mean.  It could be in your head and you may very well be pregnant!  Lets cross our fingers for pregnancy instead!  =)|`|mSEwby9waa	honestly i failed to understand ttc|`|j7XijtWFaa	i concieved 2 boys by going upside down after intercourse (on the bed with legs up against the wall) and then went to sleep (in bed) not letting anything come out. Aslo took blackmores pregnancy and breast feeding. 2 a day.|`|8vSYo9Gqaa	It sounds very likely!! <br>  <br>  Those are the same symptoms my sister in law described to me when she was pregnant, and right now i am having those symptoms and my husband also thinks its all in my head. Honestly though, how can implantation bleeding be in my head and how can i imagine my boobs being sore!! Men!<br>  <br>  Unfortunately the only thing you can do at this point is try to be patient ( I know its so so hard ) take a pregnancy test in a couple days and if it comes out negative test again a week after that. Its the only way to know. In the meantime hit up <a href="http://www.twoweekwait.com/web/" rel="nofollow">http://www.twoweekwait.com/web/</a> and study the symptoms to pass the time. That's what i do to get even more excited during the dreaded wait to take a pregnancy test!<br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope you get your positive!
53015cf51c5f798dab95e8e9aa0f9d05aa	If she is sick and not feeling well she will want to be held.. It's comfort on her part to have her mom or dad holding her.. Try sitting or laying on the couch or chair while holding her.. I know when my son was sick that's all he wanted was to be held, even in the bathtub.. It is comfort like I already said and it helps them feel a little better.. Think about it, when you are sick and have a fever you feel so crumby and you try to find things that comfort you.. I always sat on the couch or rocker when he was like this.. Good Luck and I hope she gets well soon!|`|2pOhNab2aa	they call it the terrible twos for a reason!!!|`|D3Fyxj0raa	my son does the same thing but hes 26 months out they just wanna be loved and cuddled when there sick|`|KmC0K59taa	It's b/c she doesn't feel good.  She feels better when she is being held by Daddy or Mommy.  Mine does this a lot too.  It's hard to get anything done, but it'll stop when she's feeling better.
Ka52nbhNaa	Yes - my "successes" are currently playing in their exersaucers!  I have 6 month old boy/girl twins.<br>  <br>  After ttc on our own for a year and a 1/2, we sought the help from a fertility specialist.  We went through all of the fertility testing - bloodwork, ultrasounds, hsg, semen analysis etc . . . our diagnosis was unexplained infertility.<br>  <br>  We then tried Clomid.  3 rounds with Clomid, hcg trigger shot and IUI.  I ovulated every time and DH had good counts . . . but every cycle ended up in failure.  The sperm and egg just could not find each other and implant.  We then moved onto injectible fertility meds to increase the number of mature eggs (which would hopefully increase our chances) and IUI - we tried this for 3 cycles, I had one chemical pregnancy . . . but that was it.<br>  <br>  So, after all of this, we moved onto IVF.  On our first IVF cycle, we were blessed with our twins on our first attempt.  It was a long journey - a year and a 1/2 on our own and another year of testing and treatments with the RE . . . but all worth it in the end!<br>  <br>  Best wishes & loads of baby dust to you!
6KyEHjQHaa	I potty trained my little girl at two and half.  I waited til the summer and then let her wear underwear.  I took her myself to the proper toilet every 30 mins - 1 hour to see if she had to go and get her used to going to the bathroom.  She had a few accidents but after 3 or 4 days she never looked back.  I never used a potty with her, I just got a little step so she could reach up.  Although all children are different and will do it in their own time, I wouldn't panic, they just need to get used to the feeling of 'having to go'. Going on outings can be a nightmare but hey it's only for a while.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	If she wears underwear all day, it sounds like she is doing a good job. My daughter is 3 and she is potty trained, except I still put a pull-up on her at night. So it sounds like she is doing good!<br>  <br>  Also, on long trips I still put a pull-up on my daughter then, too. She usually stays dry, but just in case she forgets to tell us.<br>  <br>  Just wanted to add, have you tried taking her to the potty every hour and having her sit on it? That's how I did my daughter in the begining, and it took about a week of that to finally get her to start telling us when she had to go to the bathroom. Good luck!|`|3IXDx9nhaa	I hate 'pottys' get a kiddy size toilet seat (that fits over the toilet and kids can sit on and reach without feeling like they are falling into the loo.
MubTZUKXaa	Get pregnant just for the ￡120.00 a week maternity allowance??  I don't think so!  It's a far cry away from full pay and not very much to live on when you have previous worked full time on a decent wage.<br>  <br>  Payment of this is based on how many weeks you have worked previous to becoming pregnant... I'm on maternity leave now, should I get pregnant again before I go back to work, I would not be entitled to maternity allowance again.  I would have to have worked a certain amount of time before I can get it again.  So no, you can't just keep getting pregnant and never work and expect maternity allowance.<br>  <br>  It doesn't effect small businesses.  They get refunded back 100% of the 'allowance' and they get compensation on top of this to allow for the training of staff for maternity cover.   Large businesses are a different story.  They only get 90% (or something in the 90s) of the allowance back.<br>  <br>  At the moment we get 52 weeks off, 38/39 weeks of this is with a paid maternity allowance.  Do we deserve this?  Of course we do!  We workers pay contributions to society. Lazy idiots who have never worked and pop out kids, that's another story!<br>  <br>  I feel sorry for Women in other Countries such as the US, where I've heard they only get up to 3 months disability pay.  A new mother and a new baby need much more time than this.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	Typical that the two people who don't find maternity leave justifiable are MEN!  (my apologies if you actually are female but only a man can talk crap like that!)<br>  <br>  I am due to go on maternity leave in a couple of months and will only be taking the 39 week 90% of my basic wage (which is lower than the standard rate of SMP so I'll be lucky to receive ￡95 per week) option as I simply can not afford to take any time off unpaid.  Is it justifiable....HELL YES!  I have worked my little behind off for the last 2 1/2 years for the company, paid my taxes and NI and don't see why I should pay someone else to look after my child which would mean claiming even more tax credits in order to do so.  My partner can't afford to take the standard paternity pay option so is keeping all of his holidays so he can receive full pay while being at home with his new son.<br>  <br>  And just for the record...this will be my third child, I work, my partner works, we claim nothing and only receive child tax credits which a majority of working parents are entitled to.  We pay our mortgage, pay our bills and our children want for nothing......maternity leave isn't something for nothing and those who say differently will be the same people who will start spouting that people shouldn't be entitled to paid holiday leave either!!|`|ROJans2Taa	here in canada we get 52 weeks, but the catch is, it is based on the last 26 weeks worked before you claim, for example im on mat leave now, I have to go back in aug, if I get pregnant again, I cant claim, because I havent worked.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Are you sure? That's basically saying that the woman can get paid maternity leave for the first YEAR after the baby is born, which is just ridiculous! Also, if this is true, I'm sure there are certain criteria that have to be met in order to qualify for this... some places don't even do paid maternity leave. And the places that do usually require you to have worked so many hours before you're eligible for it. And there would be some rule probably to prevent people from taking 2-3 years off work just to keep having babies!|`|wxImZRssaa	Your allowed to take 52 weeks. Where I work there hasn't been 1 woman who has taken their full entitlement. Most people can't afford to live on maternity pay alone, and have to come back to work early.<br>  <br>  I didn't take my full entitlement either.<br>  <br>  Small businesses can claim back the maternity pay they dish out. Statutory maternity pay is not a lot of money. It was ￡112.00 a week when I was on maternity leave in 2007.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Any place that I've worked the most you could take was 12 weeks through FMLA. and you could only get paid for that 12 weeks if you had short term disability, otherwise, you had to use your vacation and sick time and if that ran out then you didn't get paid.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	Women can claim maternity pay currently for 39 weeks provided they have been in continous employment with their current employer for 26 weeks ending with the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth. There should be no to little effect to any business, statutory maternity pay is paid by the employer but most companies can claim most of this back and in the case of small business all of it can be claimed back from the government. Im not to sure on the repeatedly getting pregnant but I suspect they would need to return to work for a period of time before becoming eligible again. Even if this is not the case I don't think most women are going to want to turn into full time baby factories and would be pretty rare. Providing the time served criteria is met and the woman is paying NI contributions she is legally entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay this is around ￡120 and is not the full wage although an employer can offer more if they wish, the word Statutory is key here so the previous answerers claim that some employers don't offer it is utter rubbish it is a legal minimum.|`|nQPcbjLKaa	Experience has shown that ironically, countries who have the best medical and maternity programs for women and children actually tend to have the lowest birth rates. You would think that some women might take advantage of generous programs, but in fact the tendency is that few women do. One reason is that pregnancy is physically difficult and strenuous on a woman, and so regardless of how generous the programs might be, it still isn't worth the health risks for most women to want to have a baby every year for 15 years. Also regardless of how good welfare might be, the standard of living is still better for a woman to work and get paid regular pay, and have 2 kids than for a woman to live on welfare of any kind and have a lot of kids. By the way, women do not "get themselves" pregnant, there is usually a man around somewhere unless you're Mary from Bethlehem, and what he says and does also influences how many children a woman might have.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	It isn't full pay and I doubt women will take advantage of it by repeatedly getting pregnant, not many women will just have a baby to keep receiving money, most women have children because they long for a child. Hardly any women are that shallow. I certainly wouldn't repeatedly get pregnant to swindle my employer, that is the mentality of women who seek to live off benefits...not career women.<br>  <br>  How it will affect female employment, I do not know. It may make some small business owners weary about employing women, most sensible ones will not be bothered. There is no way to gauge whether a woman you are interviewing will go on maternity leave as it is against the law to ask questions such as 'Do you intend to have a baby?' as that suggests you are hiring on a sex basis. <br>  <br>  I personally feel maternity leave is justified. Most women will receive 90% pay for 10 weeks and then it will taper to a much lower amount over the course of the remainder of the year they take for maternity leave. Many mothers work very hard and so they deserve the chance to go back to their career with confidence and not have to worry about money when they do start a career.<br>  <br>  I would say women today are made of very stern stuff. My mother raised me and my sister by herself with two jobs, she is now a high earning solicitor putting in many hours each day. Mothers no longer have to work in Dickensian or even ww2 environments and why should they just because their predecessors have? I don't feel as though women will take advantage of this and you cannot draw parallels between chavs on council estates and career women, it is a poor and inaccurate analogy to make. They won't be on full pay and it is not greedy.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Even if a woman got pregnant after 11 months she would still have to return to work as she wouldnt be due for another 9 but apart from that say if she got pregnant after 3 months and the second baby was due just before her first mat leave ended then she couldnt claim mat leave again. She would have to return to work for a certain amount of time before she could claim mat leave again.<br>  <br>  And yes it is justified, the first year of a babies life is very important and a mother has every right to spend that with her child.|`|AA10206525	Assuming that a woman was mad enough to keep getting pregnant just to get maternity leave even though carry a baby for 9 months is not an easy task and then looking after those many children tat she would have if she did keep getting pregnant to get maternity leave benefits,it would have a negative impact on small businesses' but I am assuming that right now the impact is not a great as it would be...if women did get pregnant just for those benefits|`|Gb6hIZ8Eaa	I think it is justified, those first 12 months of a babys development are crucial and it is important for a bond between mum and baby to be formed also. Although as most people have said here, you have to work a certain amount of time before you can become eligable to claim for maternity pay from work.|`|q6iDNUlmaa	I agree with Dee. Besides, most companies have a clause "subject to maximum of two children". So you see, a woman canNOT avail maternity leave 'ad infinitum'.<br>  <br>  Rolyn - Do you really think its easy for a woman to get pregnant for 9 months and keep making babies just to get paid?? Try getting pregnant once!!|`|znW4b0Mfaa	I was under the influence maternity leave was 12 weeks max.<br>  I had my baby in 2005,and at that time it was 12 weeks.<br>  I can't see any company paying a woman for a whopping 52 weeks<br>  on maternity leave.Hey if you can get it,cool,but I have never heard of it.

CxCigxZIaa	For starters with the potty training issue try this:<br>  <a href="http://www.pottytrainingconcepts.com/CTGY/Potty-Training-Videos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pottytrainingconcepts.com/CTG...</a><br>  it's strictly for little boys. (my son did very well with these)<br>  I took my son and let him pick out the "big boy" undies that he would like to wear once he could go potty by himself. He couldn't wait to wear them and it made him actually WANT to use the potty. (remember: accidents happen and when they do, be calm and simply take care of it.) Cheerios work great too...put one in the toilet and see if he can AIM for it.<br>  As for discipline. Normally one parent is the disciplinarian so nothing will change there. As your son grows he will notice this also. If he doesn't discipline him there's really not allot you can do except enforce good behavior at home. (sorry .. that's just how it is) Knowing that the child's grandmother (your ex's mom) will be there should be comforting to you. Be glad that she is and let her know it. <br>  MOST of your communication will be with her. Let her know ANY issues you might have. She's a mom and will totally understand.<br>  Wishing you and your little one the best.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	1. Remember, at 2 he may not be as ready as you think for potty training. Go ahead and give it a try, but keep in mind, if it becomes too stressful for him and is taking a longggg time.. then stop, wait a few months and try again. I found with all my boys they were more ready at age 3. Also keep in mind that with the recent break up with his dad it may be more than he can handle right now.<br>  <br>  2. You keep disciplining as you always would. He will learn that there is a difference between your house and dad's house. That's okay as long as he knows that at mom's house there are rules and they will be followed. When he starts school the rules there may not be the same as yours, but he will adjust as all kids do. We can't control how others discipline our kids through life, but we can remain consistent with how we discipline our kids in our homes.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can be the main decision maker for your child and just let dad know what is going on. Just remember though, never underestimate the importance of a father. Even if they aren't the greatest, they do make a difference.|`|9NXtWzUOaa	if this is  supervised visitation, as you say, then there will be a guardian ad litem prestent. talk the GAL and explain what you have posted here. if the dad is ever allowed to take the child on his own, buy a potty seat and tell him how important it is for him to work with you. the GAL will help  you.

Good luck hope all works out.|`|AlxMp9l3aa	Some pain is normal towards the end of the pregnancy as the baby and your body gets ready for delivery, but if you are concerned i would speak to your midwife they will be able to put your mind at ease, better safe than sorry.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Hmm 34 weeks that means if your baby is ready to come then your baby (I don't like calling babies 'it') would be born 1 month early good luck:)|`|6j9Lb83Caa	yep the baby could have felt discompfort from your boyfriends penis there, and could have possibley moved down a little more making your self dialate i bet you you are going to be going into laboer very shortly id go see your mid wife and check in with her just to be on the safe side and so that she can prepare you for the beautiful delivery of your baby girl/boy
ZbnxGIsnaa	I really don't blame you!  It is hard getting negative tests!  I got a buttload of them the first round with my son.  I was 5 weeks late and I really wish I would have gone and got a blood test done instead of that waiting game. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is for you to wait another week and if it's still negative and you haven't started I'd get a blood test done.|`|tmBBywZsaa	honey if your 4 days late and you got brown like discharge and a neg hpt i would wait a week to test again as every woman is different and if you not happy go to the docs he may give you some insight to whats happening!!

4Bgw5xs8aa	They let people smoke in your bowling alley? In my town you aren't allowed to smoke within 50 ft of a building, and if you're pulled over and you are smoking in the car with a child, you get ticketed. I think these are great laws and maybe you should write a letter to your city or state asking about it.<br>  <br>  To answer you question, yes I would take my baby to the bowling alley because no one smokes in there. Even if they did smoke in there, I would take them. BUT I would take them like during the day or on sunday when it isn't crowded and even if someone is smoking I can ask for a lane far away from them. I don't really see the reason in taking a baby to the alley though. They can't bowl and it seems like I would be more focused on taking care of my 4 month old then having a good time. I would hire a sitter or leave her with my mom so I could really enjoy myself.|`|OZ474DMYaa	I did. My son was about 2 months old. It was a non-smoking alley and on a military base so i felt confident enough to take him.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I'd NEVER take my child into a smoky atmosphere, it's irresponsible parenting.

Does your baby cry.... a lot?|`|z6IekuwSaa	I might, depends on just how noisy it was.

It was the 80's.  People didn't know.  Calling it child abuse is a bit harsh.  Is it healthy no....but abuse???  Seems like you are overreacting.<br>  <br>  ETA:  I live in an area where smoking is still allowed in public places.  It makes it kind of hard to go anywhere.  So thumbs down all you want.  I don't smoke and wouldn't dream of puttting my kid in harms way on purpose like I said.  But whatever.  LOL!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes i did it was his great grand pas 50th b-day and he was almost a month old its not that big of a deal as long as you are focused on him<br>  <br>  edit: there was no smoke at the bowling alley we were at <br>  but these children were near smoke and they were newborns that is insane i cant stand that kind of child abuse <br>  and that is what it is if your child is neat smoke becuase we know how badly it can damage a baby|`|ROJans2Taa	I did, my son was almost 4 mths, and my husband had his annual xmas party there, he wasn't the only baby either, there was 4 others<br>  <br>  added info - im in canada and here there no smoking allowed in any indoor public place, so no I wouldnt if there was smoking, I didnt realize there were still places that allowed smoking inside, thats crazy!

I only know of a few Sonja's. its a pretty name and underused.|`|miFe45quaa	I'm not too fond of the spelling...what about Sonya, or Sonia? <br>  I don't like Rae, but to each his own!<br>  <br>  Overall, Sonja Rae is just not my taste (I love the surname...haha).|`|61NKzPzMaa	Sonia is the proper spelling and looks much nicer than Sonja.<br>  <br>  Rae is a trashy ugly spelling of the masculine BOYS name Ray.|`|TrBoPj92aa	=)|`|QmWzBERjaa	I personally do not like the name at all.<br>  Sorry!|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	don`t like it|`|5pAVY0SWaa	Have never liked the name Sonja.  Unfortunately my husband really does. One of his mom's names is Sonja, his is Jason - change the letters around.   It is cute for that reason, but I could never use it.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	I personally think it's a little old fashioned, but old fashioned names are in now! It's totally up to you, if you love it, go for it!|`|KlWWh3fgaa	I prefer the spelling Sonya, but I doubt you care too much. Ray/Rae is a boys name.|`|c34ff1f2d66a580bdbc491850122d151aa	its nice|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	nice name i like it too
TruIVxqGaa	First off, don't ever give up. My advice would be not to try so hard. In January I started provera to jump start my cycle- my body didnt respond to that and my doctor was sending me to an Infertility Specialist.. well I finally got my period and I called my OBGYN and asked if I could take clomid just to give it a shot before going that route.. She said it was okay and I am currently 4wks 4days. But to be honest, I took the pills and had so much going on in my life that my husband and i didnt try. We didnt time the days we had sex, we didnt check for ovulation.. it just happened. and i believe that it happend because we took the pressure off. But to answer your answer, I became pregnant off my first cycle of clomid however I dont think clomid was entirely the reason we were successful. Good Luck =)|`|EnKFZ7Roaa	I did not but did the second month. If clomid is going to work it will within the first few months. I would suggest taking something to help with cervical mucus since clomid can make yours hostile.<br>  Guaifenesin is a good one it should be with the cough medicines but make sure its the only ingredient.<br>  <br>  <br>  best of luck|`|vjK8ZT20aa	I got pregnant on one cycle of clomid with my fourth child.  I ovlulated on the 17th day of my cycle.  I didn't take any other medications.  I am not sure why you are on comid if you ovulate on your own because that is what is meant to do.  So if you just have unexplained infertility clomid may not solve your problem. But I do with you the best of luck and I hope you get the BFP you desire.
1xsUVtzBaa	After a year and one miscarriage im now getting my hormones checked..they do a blood test on day 7 and day 21 of your cycle. They test your progesterone..oestradiol..follicle stimulating hormone and lutenizing hormone. I have really bad PMS..crazy mad mood swings and tears. It could be a sign of a hormonal imbalance. Best thing is to get a full blood test..test the above i mentioned, your thyroid function and your prolactin. Then see your gyne about the results.<br>  Good luck :)|`|weBOR9YCaa	I think that you are on the right path. It has only been 3 moth for us ttc, and it is torture. I usually cry when my period comes and start looking for other options to help us get pregnant. Just last night I had a dream that I finally saw a positive hpt only to wake up to disappointment. I am due for AF on 3/14. I hope that she doesn't come.  Good luck to you|`|V8JoRHnnaa	like i wishhhh and pray that AF  doesnt show her face but otherwise i';; go to water park this month. set incentives for urself<br>  baby dust
2ObqoJbKaa	You took the test way to early. You need to wait until you miss your period. THat would be the most accurate. However, with some of the tests you can test up to four days early. but I think its better to wait til you miss your period. good luck.|`|wj7Mbw2Jaa	it is possible.. although, you will need to take a test once you have MISSED your period for it to be more accurate, testing 10days before your period you are just wasting your money. The early sensitive pregnancy tests will read 5days maximum before your period is due.<br>  <br>  just wait until then and find out for sure, or you could go see your doc!<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|42vC5ztpaa	I know how you feel sometimes is hard to just wait around and test especially if you are trying to get pregnant. But I would say you took the test to soon wait a few more days and test again the HCG hormone probably isn’t strong enough yet for a urine test yet. Just hand in there only time will tell|`|apUkTo3maa	MAYBE YOU SHOULD WAIT TIL YOU ACTUALLY MISS YOUR PERIOD.
AA11763588	Buy a pregnancy test.|`|GjuRYsITaa	if you've had unprotected sex then take a pregnancy test|`|XJQOffkZaa	I had cramping for a week before my period was due and I was expecting my period to arrive on the due date, but 3 days later I had more cramps but still no period so i took a test and thankfully it was positive - i am now 6 weeks pregnant :)|`|ltJn1y0uaa	Periad????

B6tGYfEgaa	My baby is four months old. I have only left her alone with daddy to go to yoga for one-two hours a few times recently and she was great once or twice and then the last two times she completely lost it. She is breastfeeding though and teething and of course I sometimes use my boobies as a dummy/pacifier so it's possible she was just getting worked up and the proper comfort wasn't coming. Though this is very confusing because sometimes it is only my husband who can walk her aound, get her to stop crying and fall asleep. I absolutely need my own life, though I am aware that this time is not mine, that it is essentially my daughter's. But soon I plan to attempt to have a little more time without the baby. Just a little (and more than a litle if she's content and happy. It's good for her to be handled by different people. Though the priority is her happiness). Anyway to answer your question, I'd say all babies and mommies are so different. The most important thing is to go with your instinct, and I say this because you obviously care and are intelligent, because you are 'researching' and asking. So you should do what you feel. Maybe start by one to two hours in the day, then at night, and then go for a night out for yourself. This idea of complete self-sacrifice for the baby is ridiculous to me. A happy, free-er, lighter, mom with her own self intact will be a much better and more loving mother to their baby. I love my baby more than anything and I know it's important for me to keep a sense of myself and have some of my own time, for myself, but more importanly for her. Good luck!!!|`|Zr1APGtmaa	Well, I left my baby girl for a couple of hours during the first month, to run some errands, but after that I used to leave her really short periods of time with her grandparents and dad 2-3 hrs. Now she is 3months old and I returned to work so she has to stay 8 hrs with her grandmother, the first day she cried a lot, but now she is getting used to waking up and looking at her granny. So my answer would be  either daytime or nightime try to leave her with someone you trust for a couple of hrs just so that se can get used to this person and doesn't impact her much not seeing you for a bunch of hrs a day. Also if she sleeps during the night this would be great for a night out, that way you know she will be sleeping when you are gone.|`|7edddef837f9013ff2f1f46a6893dcb7aa	It all depends on who the sitter is. My mom took watched my daughter when she was 3 weeks old so that my husband and I could go out for our anniversary. She's 8 weeks old now, and I don't have any problem leaving her for a few hours with a grandparent, aunt, uncle, or one of a few close friends. My MIL is staying with us for a while, and I absolutely trust her to take care of the little one while I do errands during the day and when my husband and I have an occasional 'date night'. I wouldn't leave my daughter with one of my teenage nieces or nephews - even for a couple of hours - until she's at least 2 or 3 years old.|`|nZh4PM4Qaa	my daughter was about 4 weeks old. my mom bought us tickets to a comedy show from like 7-10, i left aubrey with my boyfriend. I had a great time it was really nice and boy did i laugh my *** off. he told me i could drink and everyone i went with tried to get me trashed but all i wanted to do when i got home was hold my baby so there was no drinkin for me. and i called and text him a hundred times to check on her. you have the rest of your life to spend with your baby, go out have a good time!|`|ybexjS2Paa	I never do. Recently I had to leave them for 2 hours because I had a parent meeting at the kindergarten and all the time I was sitting there thinking if they are ok. They were although my little one missed me and cried a lot. I know I need to get a life and I will eventually..not yet though ;)|`|a2c0c92c2b11472715578dcec0e6563caa	For a night out only for once because we are visiting my mum and sisters.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My daughter was about 8 weeks old the first time I left her.  I left her in the mid-afternoon for a few hours, so I could take my mother to dinner and a movie for her birthday.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My husband and I went on a date mid-day when my daughter was six months old. We took advantage of when she took her nap, had someone come watch her for us, and we went to a movie. She woke up 20 minutes before we got back and it worked out perfectly!|`|UghJ0XROaa	My oldest was 2 months, She was sleeping through the night and we dropped her off at 7 and went out for a late dinner and a hotel room, lol, we were out the door by 8 the next morning, because i was going crazy and she had slept from 9PM to 9AM anyway, so i didn't miss a thing. After that, it was not until 7 months.<br>  <br>  My youngest, has not spent a day with someone else, she is 4 months and not sleeping through the night. My "rule" is not until she sleeps through the night will she stay anywhere. We have went to dinner a couple times and where she is with one of the grandparents for 2 hours. <br>  <br>  Although i did have an all day shopping trip yesterday, but the girls were with daddy.|`|FcHplZtQaa	I'm leaving my twins for 2nights, they'll be 11mths, that'll be the first time I'll have left them..........and I'm leaving them with their dad so I can take my daughters away for a couple of days|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i baby sat my nephew for the first time when he was 5weeks old, it was his mum and dads anniversary though, they rang like every hour to see if he was ok lol|`|O8XjkCjxaa	Mmm...day out I think.

Then it was when me and my hubby went to walmart to do shopping at close to 2 months. then a few weeks ago I came down wit strep and a 103 fever we left him with the god mom again so he didnot catch anything at the hospital. Then a week ago for 2 hrs for me and my hubby can go out again with his god mom.|`|AA11903503	My baby was almost 7 weeks old, my sister drove 300 miles to babysit so my husband and I could go out to dinner.

wZAeBisbaa	I would probably make her do the detention, or part of it at least.  Maybe you and the school principal could compromise on one week.   <br>  What she did was not acceptable, and she should learn that there are consequences. It is appropriate that this lesson be learned between her and the school.  <br>  <br>  The inconvenience to you is a consideration, but on the other hand, if you were to discipline her yourself, it would still be inconvenient.  And parents sometimes do have to put up with inconvenience if it is in the best interest of their children.   <br>  <br>  Whether the other girls have to go to detention or not is not relevant.  This is your daughter and your rules.  If she had talked to you in advance about getting excused, maybe you would have considered it.  But to do it after the fact is unfair and puts you in a difficult position. <br>  <br>  I would not sign the note, but I would not punish her separately at home.  Let the detention serve that purpose.  However, if the cost of transporting her is significant, charge her for the gas and/or your time.|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	That's up to you.  I think it's good that you intend on punishing her either way.<br>  <br>  Your story shows one of the big reasons schools are in such a sad state these days.  Schools are afraid to punish their children due to parents who won't parent, and don't show up at school unless it's to complain about something.  <br>  <br>  Being a good parent takes hard work.  I applaud you for driving to school every night to punish her, even though it is an inconvenience.  Your daughter will most likely cope with adulthood better than her friends.|`|AA11784984	I wouldn't sign it. She knew it was wrong and so do you. It the other girls parents that are in the wrong now and not teaching their daughters right from wrong. Yes it will seem unfair to your daughter but maybe she will learn from it and not do it again. As for the other girls they will most likely do it again because the didn't get in trouble this time.|`|7aCH91ISaa	I think you need to back the school. If you sign the note it shows her that you will back the school.|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	Sign it, is will be easier for everyone involved.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I agree fully with its.haze. I would sign it, to make it easier on you. But make sure you punish her, that she is to go straight home from school go straight up to her room. Strip it bare, only leave the bed and her clothes. Don't even leave her a book to read. Only let her come down for dinner, and right back up for showers and bed. She will surly learn her lesson more here, than having after school detention with her friends.|`|QP46eVi4aa	i would sign it so it don't go on the peranment record and then your own punishment at home and let her know next time something comes up just to talk to you and the to of you can decide together if she should go<br>  <br>  but tell her she is not to see them girls for 2 weeks cause that is part of the not getting the detention|`|ffxqr6wFaa	I see your point but what will this say to your daughter?  I think you should support the school and allow her to be detained.  I know it puts you out but your daughter must understand there must be consequences to her actions.<br>  <br>  I feel the other parents are helping their own children to snub their nose at school and the rules.<br>  <br>  If anything had happenned to your daughter during this truancy the school may have been blamed.|`|wObmwK1uaa	my little sister is 14 and my mum said she would sign the note for her, you can punish her more than the school can, although won't it look abit suspicious if all of the notes have been signed when they are all friends.|`|yfxhrxm2aa	Usual form of the world today. Teachers and schools have no authority over pupils and their behaviour, due to parents backing down and supporting "wee johnny". Do what your heart is telling you to do, and it will be the right thing.|`|kDCeMTh7aa	I mean teenagers will be teenagers. Let her off this time & if it happens again leave her in detention, so she'll learn her lesson. That's what my mom did when I skipped.|`|qOAuda4Kaa	Sign it . . .but then maybe impose your own style detention at home. That way you won't be hasseled picking her up, but she still gets punished.|`|0DtWgXxUaa	I would just sign it, and punish her at home. Make sure she knows that next time, you WONT be so leniant, and will comfirm with the school.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	That really is a tough one - I would be torn as well. I think I would have to sign it, and then punish her at home, but tell her that if it ever happens again, she will serve the dentention whether the others do or not. She must also be punished at home, I would suggest grounding her for the same amount of time as she would have had dentention, and maybe a bit more to emphasise that you haven't bailed her out to give her an easy ride.
2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	Your doctor is an idiot. It doesn't take long to go from 5-7 min to 3-5  minutes!

7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	Instead of having him sit for 5 minutes, only allow him 1 minute of sitting on the potty time every 30-45-60min or so.(however often his pattern is) If he does not go during that minute, take him back to the potty every five minutes or so until he goes. It may take some time for him to connect the idea that going to the potty means it is time to potty, but it will come. <br>  <br>  Good luck, this time in a toddler's life can be really difficult for both of you.|`|ow5mrcByaa	Have him pee standing up. Best thing to start him off peeing standing up, is to lift up the potty just below his willy so it can't miss, and make encouraging noises to go. When he does a few like that, you can leave the potty on the floor, or use the toilet, but you'll need to teach him to aim which means you aiming it for him to start with. Peeing will be fun for him standing up cos he can see what's happening and more likely to go. Good luck.|`|6d37069c5dadd18ae165702d8afb480faa	Presuming he's not already 14 years old or something... Give him time.  Be encouraging, but not too much.  Let him see how the grownups do it.  Don't pressure him.  <br>  <br>  My son went on the potty a few times and my husband and I got all excited.  He stopped for a while.  Our reaction, even though it was positive, was too much for him. Treat it like it's nice that he's doing it, but it's not so important that you have to bend your life around it.  It's just a normal development, and he will experiment with it, and not do it perfectly for a while.  He will get it.

f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I'm not a man but i can answer for my husband as we had a son 15 months ago. my husband isnt circumcised, but he wanted  our son to be.to me that says alot, so we DID have it done, with no problems, and he never seemed to be  in pain for a moment.<br>  <br>  there is sure alot of ignorant people in here thumbs downing people for a personal opinion.|`|4arnbpUCaa	I'm glad my parents didn't get me circumcised.<br>  <br>  I've never had any problems or infections down there, and the foreskin is fun and pleasurable.

His answer:<br>  <br>  He'd never really given it any thought because right now we only have a girl. So, I asked him to think in terms of someone who could potentially be the father of a little boy one day and he said that since he was circumcised and he's never had a problem with it, then he'd probably have the procedure done on his son.<br>  -------------------------------<br>  I'd also like to add that he didn't realize that he had a choice in the matter. He knew some did not based on religious preference and such, but he just thought it was basically one of the many "new baby" procedures that are done...Like cutting the cord.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	It shouldn't be done unless it is medically necessary other wise is it just mutilation, I do find it odd how women will say "my body my decision" and then do something like that (not to say all women are like that). <br>  <br>  Some one who feels the need to have that much control over some one must have some issues, something like that should be the man's decision.|`|OWOtKZmgaa	its 2009 and i can't understand why archaic surgery from 1890 is still being carried out, its cruel removes 20.000 of the 24.000 nerves contained in the human penis does not reduce STD's its painful for the baby with almost no pain relief and removes up to 1/2 the penile skin,so whats good about it oh yes you never have to wash your penis again , but you wash the rest of your body every day so wheres the problem in washing your penis at the same time?  oh yes and the docs make money and they sell your foreskin for 50 bucks after the chop . stop the scam stop the OP ,    i am as nature intended and would never want to be any other way, if i have a boy child he will be too and if he has to be a home birth to avoid those sicko doctors  he will be.

I know my parents thought they were choosing the best for me but a part of me can never forgive them for not protecting me from this useless and cruel surgery. <br>  I realised I was missing out when I saw a mate masturbate at 12.<br>  Circumcision removes between half to two thirds of the penile skin. It seems a small thing on a baby but covers 15 square inches on an adult. The skin has a unique gliding action and slides on itself like lube. As adults all males use what loose skin they have or a lubricant to masturbate with. If you have been cut since birth you don't know what you are missing but an intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using the gliding action of the skin. He can also use a lubricant if he wants to. The gliding action of the foreskin also acts as a lubricant during intercourse and the skin acts as a dam keeping the natural lubrication inside the vagina from drying out. There are specialised structures within the foreskin such as the nerve-rich ridged band and frenulum. <br>  There are claims of protection against HIV from circumcision but this research is contested. They are based on research in Africa, where anal sex is a common form of hetrosexual contraception. Even if true, circumcision offers very marginal lessening of the risk of infection, certainly not enough to say you don't have to wear a condom. The vast majority of males wiped out by the first wave of the epidemic in the USA were circumcised and it certainly did not protect them. European countries, where circumcision rates are around 1% have lower rates of HIV infection and other STDs than the USA.<br>  Similar claims about UTIs and penile cancer are also very marginal. You would have to do about 140 circumcisions to prevent one UTI, which can be treated by antibiotics anyway. Penile cancer is so rare as to be a ridiculous reason to circumcise (about 1:100,000 men in developed countries regardless of circumcision rate. Non-circumcising Denmark has a much lower rate of penile cancer than the US. <br>  The major complication rate from circumcisions is around 2% (20 per 1000), mostly haemorrhage and serious infection. This negates the beneficial effect on these marginal claims. A small number of babies actually die from circumcision complications.<br>  In addition it should be noted that the penis forms as one structure, including the foreskin. In almost all cases the foreskin is firmly adhered to the glans at birth, rather like a fingernail is adhered to the finger. To perform an infant circumcision the surgeon firstly has to rip apart the two layers with forceps, which since infant circumcisions are generally done in the USA without anaesthetic, must be agonising even before the actual cutting. After the circumcision the baby stings the wound and the whole raw surface of the glans every time he pees. <br>  Most complications from infant circumcision do not show up until much later in life. These include skin bridges that form as the penis heals and bits of cut and raw foreskin can fuse onto the raw glans. So the real complication rate is much higher.<br>  No medical authority in the world recommends routine infant circumcision anymore. The US is the last western country still circumcising about half its newborn males. Australia and Canada have largely abandoned the practice within a generation.<br>  If the newborn penis is left intact then there is no gap between the glans and the foreskin, so there is nowhere germs can collect. Misguided attempts to retract the foreskin at this stage can damage the foreskin. These attempts are the main reason for problems with the foreskin at this stage and subsequent unnecessary circumcisions. As the baby grows he should be encouraged to stretch his foreskin and as soon as he can retract easily to wash with plain water regularly.<br>  Geoff|`|rFUqIakAaa	I am not circumcised and I've very happy that I was left intact for many reason. I've never wanted to be circumcised because the way it is now feels good so I wouldn't want to chop off my foreskin. It's really hard for me to imagine how guys who've been cut can masturbate without a foreskin. Circumcised guys (and women who don't know any better) are always saying how it's cleaner or healthier like it's so hard to clean if you are not circumcised, but I really don't think they know what they are talking about. It's actually really easy and not a problem at all! <br>  <br>  I would not have my son circumcised because I don't see the purpose behind it. I wouldn't want my kid to go through a painful procedure like that for no medical reason and I think if anything HE should make that decision himself since it is his body. The fact that everyone has so many different views on circumcision is proof enough that those kinds of decisions should be left to the individual, not the parents!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	It's mutilation.
6LxXR61Waa	You definitely need to get the UTI taken care of IMMEDIATELY, as that will only get worse with time.  When you go in, tell them that you are 4 weeks pregnant, so they'll be careful with whatever meds/antibiotics they give you.  Don't wait until Tuesday!|`|ROJans2Taa	pains and cramps in early pregnancy are common, however pain while peeing isnt, id go get checked for that and tell them your pregnant, if treated you and your baby will be fine|`|AA11724307	I would go to the urgent care for sure.  UTI's can get very bad causing more serious problems and should be treated as soon as possible.  I had a friend who left one before...travelled to her kidneys and she started peeing out blood.  Now anytime she gets a UTI it goes straight to her kidneys in less then a day.  Tell them you think you are pregnant at the urgent care and they will likely confirm it because it might effect what medications they give you to treat it.  good luck|`|Kw4zqfu0aa	Go to a urgent care or to the hospital NOW. Do not wait. You are risking you like and your baby's. UTI can be very serious if left untreated. Did you hear about the Brazilian supermodel who died from it last month? Well, I did not mean to scare you, but get medical help now, please.|`|ADjeuxIiaa	For both of my pregnancies I had severe painful cramps for the first 2-3 months. My OB said it was due to stretching of the uterus. DO ask about it when you see your OB on Tuesday. <br>  <br>  As far as the possible UTI goes... you should go to urgent care and letg them know you are pregnant. With my first pregnancy I had HG and was in and out of the ER probably 15 times in the first 7 months. They confirmed pregnancy every single time and usually did an ultrasound. If you do have a UTI it is imperitive that you get it taken care of as soon as possible since any sever infections can harm your baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!

I have done ballet since I was three and I always wore underwear so it is up to you, it is your decision. If you are still unsure contact the gymnastics studio that your little girl will be going to and ask there. I hope this helps.
dgRTkccBaa	No, two is actually worse.  it increases the chance of the condom tearing because of the friction caused between the two condoms.  Use them as the directions on the package say.|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	No, two condoms at a time is worse, just as the first answer said. Tell him that there is more of a chance that you get pregnant NOT using a condom. Condoms for men are actually for the most of the time very efficient, and they do the job. Mostly. :P|`|CWfGCYYTaa	no, the friction between them causes them to break.<br>  <br>  use condoms with spermicide for extra protection.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you wait a while longer, however, if you don't know that fact|`|AA12069058	No, two will not stay on properly.Just use one and tell your dumb boyfriend they are 99.9% effective and they do work.?|`|b0Z8c6wJaa	Wait do you mean using a male condom and a female condom? Don't do that! You have a higher chance of that not working, and that could have some bad consequences. They may break off or create friction.

It really is that simple.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Actually 2 makes it worse. The friction between the two con domeswill make it easier to break. But here is what I really want to say to you, do not let him talk you into not wearing a condom. You could end up with an std or the next girl on Maury saying he denies the baby. Please make sure to be aware of your body and let no man talk you into not protecting yourself. They do work, and so what if he does not like the feeling. <br>  Tyffannie
8yE2sYGeaa	There is no credible evidence that castor oil will induce labor any more than having sex will do this (another popular remedy)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Try natural things like walking, cleaning on your hands and knees, sex, and just relaxing.<br>  <br>  The baby will come when the baby is ready. Every extra day the baby is in there the healthier and easier it will be on the baby.<br>  <br>  Castor oil makes your bowel muscles painfully contract and since the uterus is a smooth muscle it MIGHT copy the bowels and bring on contractions... but that doesn't mean full labor will start.|`|7ktbbv2Maa	i used caster oil with my second child it did not give me the runs nor did it hurt my baby i took it the day before i had her and i was 38 weeks pregnant and misserable as hell so i took a small bottle of caster oil and chugged it down and by the next day i had my baby girl and she was a beautiful 6 lb 9 oz baby girl|`|C0GeEv7kaa	I tried everything from sex to walking to eating weird foods and nothing helped. Then I resorted to castor oil. I made a milkshake and mixed in 4oz of castor oil and downed it quick. It gave me bad diarrhea! I took it at 5pm and had my baby girl at 3:48am that night. My baby was just fine but turns out she had a complete knot in her umbilical cord so she's my miracle baby. I had her at 39.4 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  PS-castor oil is really cheap. I got mine for under $2.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	I tried castor oil and would not recommend it. It did nothing but make me go to the bathroom all day when I should have been resting up. I was naseous, it tastes HORRIBLE. I had to swallow it twice because it's so thick it didn't want to go down, and then it didn't want to stay down. It is really thick, you can't get that taste out for anything. <br>  It can cause the baby to have a BM while still inside. It is disgusting. I really wanted my daughter to come and figured I would try anything. I was convinced it would work. I would have happily dealt with the crappy irregular labor than do that to myself again.<br>  <br>  Eat spicy food, pineapple, walk, have sex, wash bathroom walls. Get your husband (if there is one) to play with your nipples. Do squats. But hold onto something so you don't fall. Even an orgasm by yourself will help get your uterus contracting better. <br>  Please, rethink the oil.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	I am def in your same situation! 38 weeks tomorrow. 2.5 cm dialated, 75% effaced (as of thurs) having contractions since last sunday but not strong enough to go back to l/d. at home coping with the pain and uncomfortableness. just itching to get the baby out already lol<br>  <br>  Anyways. I heard castor oil works for some people. However, i did not try it and i dont think i will. because it makes you poops lots, tummy aches, and most of all theres a risk for giving a baby infection because it might cross theplacenta and make the baby poop as well. the baby will end of swalling his own stuff and catch and infection. those are the risks and i dont like the idea of them.<br>  <br>  So, I have been walking, walking, walking. Squatting, sitting on a ball, having sex, having hot baths, and walking up and down stairs a lot over the past 3 days. i am exhausted but this baby has to comeout because hes hurting me.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ADjeuxIiaa	Castor oil does cause you to empty your bowels within 3 hours of taking it and the chances of it being horribly messy are high. The safest alternatives are walking and as long as you and baby are healthy, sex. The mans semen will help to start contractions.|`|77HV1jsJaa	Castor oil can be dangerous. Just go to the mall and walk for an bit, then have a huge meal. Thats what my doc told me with my first child and it worked.|`|Kw4zqfu0aa	One of the best things to induce labor is actually having sex. If you are up to it, do it. Otherwise, try walking.|`|igPBuDHkaa	i got to 4 cm not even a sweep would start me off again only thing that worked was sex hope that helps  x|`|tMeN2fm0aa	I have heard the castrol oil is effective, but also gives you AWFUL diarriah! I think I spelt that wrong... sorry.  Also that it tastes nasty... so mix it with orange juice or something if you do take it... Since you are so far along you should be going to the Dr every week at this point correct??? Ask your Dr to scrape your membranes... it takes 5 seconds and is done with their fingers... when they check your cervix they just scratch the cervix a little and this gets things going.  I had this done with my last pregnancy and I was in labor within a day.  It works!!!  Ive also heard that stimulating your nipples helps because it releases a chemical in your body that is like Pitocen... it dialates your cervix more... I have also heard that a mans semen will do it... It has a chemical in it like Pitocen that dialates and helps induce labor... Also Spicey Foods and Walking!  Walking is good because it basically causes gravity to pull the baby down... Which is why when a woman goes to the hospital because she is in labor, alot of times the Dr will have her walk if she isnt progressing enough (I had to walk with my first two)  SO good luck! I know how excited you are!!! Congrads on the birth of you angel!!!!!

mPsXwj8eaa	Yes you can. Birth control does exactly was it's meant for, to prevent you from getting pregnant ! It doesn't stop STDs, etc. though. My advice is to still use condoms unless you're with that significant other and plan to be with them long-term. Another helpful advice would to get tested, both you and your partner.|`|apUkTo3maa	YES YOU CAN IF YOU WANT. ? .? .?|`|zXvbPknZaa	yes you can, that will prevent you from getting pregnant but if you don't use other protection you could get STD's (now called STI's) So use other protection , because birth control does not prevent you from getting any STD's (STI's).|`|bVfzC8LMaa	yes, what do you think birth control is for?<br>  to prevent getting pregnant, <br>  i wouldn't recommend it, because it doesn't prevent against STD's and other diseases, <br>  but if your in a long term relationship with someone, and you KNOW they have nothing, then i guess that would be fine, <br>  but no offense i would get them tested.. you can't always believe what men say,|`|2ObqoJbKaa	If your on the pill you are protected against pregnancy, if thats what you mean, but your not protected against std's.|`|JafmNha5aa	Sure if you know your partner doesn't have any diseases.
AlxMp9l3aa	I would avoid the water slides  and rapids while you are pregnant, it will usually tell you on the sign e.g children under a certain height cant use slide pregnant women cant use etc.  If there is no sign, ask the life guards, i also suppose it depends if it is just a gentle slide or a really fast one? Swimming lightly is fine.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	13 weeks is still in the danger zone. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't risk it.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	NO its not, i went to go t wet"n"wild once, water slides and stuff there, ther was a notice saying do not ride if pregnant.... there was my money wasted, i just sat on the pool|`|6j9Lb83Caa	no i really dont think this would be the best thing to do your moving around could cause anxiety and stress to the baby and could cause a very bad miscarrage or your could really make yourself and the baby sick to the stomach i really think that all that movement wouldnt be necessary knowing that you are going to be 13 weeks pregnet on wednsday. yes so i had just confirmed with my mother who had had 3 other children beforre one who had died inside the womb at 6 months and this is a move you dont want to make, because after youre 13 week period that just symbolizes that your baby is healthy and it is unlikely for you to have a misscarrage aqfter that week but you going on these rides will and can cause stress to the baby and can probablly cause you to have a misscarrage. DONT GO ON THESE RIDES PLEASE!|`|f15fae9678a173ccb0d1f8132c549bedaa	Personally I wouldnt, because I dont think its worth the risk. I would just stick to swimming and then you wouldnt have anything to worry about.|`|4sr1Mn7yaa	I don't think you should be going  sliding down slides when pregnant .You could have a miscarriage.|`|XJQOffkZaa	they say you should avoid anything which causes an impact or jerks on your body such as roller coasters etc I would avoid water slides but maybe check with your doctor before you go.|`|R3iaCpZVaa	Are u nuckin futs....u can loose ya baby

Shortly afterwards we broke up for a silly reason and I made a stupid decision and slept with someone else-I regret THAT. By the time I was 17 I was back with myboyfriend, then enaged, married and fell pregnant, then after turning 18 I had my first child. THE MOST life changing 2 years of my whole life. <br>  <br>  The teens that i've encountered that are having sex, seem to be doing it for the following reasons-<br>  Peer pressure-Not as many teens are having sex as you may think, but they assume everyone else is and feel pressured to have sex. Some think it's "cool" or makes them more mature.<br>  Pressure from their boyfriend/girlfriend<br>  Drinking-I've had girls come into my office because they got drunk and cheated on their boyfriend, or got drunk and had sex and don't remember it, or got drunk and did something else stupid. Half the students at my school go out binge drinking every friday and saturday night. Alcohol is a huge problem.<br>  They don't understand sex-A lot of teenagers don't understand or realise they emotional and spirtiual aspect of sex. That it should be about more than just the physicality. This is something I went out of my way to talk about with my 15yo daughter.<br>  Bad sex ed-They either don't know or don't understand the physical or emotional risks because they haven't been educated and informed enough. <br>  Curiosity-they are teens, full of hormones, wanting to experiement and find out what the big deal about sex is.<br>  They are ready for sex-Let's face it, some people are ready to have sex earlier than others. Some people are truly ready at 15,  some people aren't truly ready until 25.<br>  <br>  That's just my opinion-I may be wrong. But I work with teens aged 12-17 (I teach) and have a teenage daughter myself, so this is an issue I have to deal with a lot.<br>  <br>  Hope you find the answers you are looking for :)|`|gtLqWHp3aa	what happened to parenting? parents used to be involved with their children at every age. my mom knew where i was and what was going on with me all the time. i had a job and went to school, had friends i hung out with at home, etc. where are the parents?!|`|X8OuurCSaa	Not really..<br>  <br>  Sure, teens dont have much to do, not because theres not stuff on offer for them, but because they just dont want to do that stuff.<br>  <br>  They want to do what they enjoy, and thats what they enjoy..<br>  :L|`|xOqefUvtaa	When my mother was a teenager she had my brother. She's probably older than you. I know several older people who had children young, so it definitely has nothing to do with the generations. <br>  <br>  Your parents probably raised you better than other children were raised. Thinking of the teenage girls I knew who had babies, two of them were drug addicts and didn't have jobs. One dropped out of high school before they had a kid, the other dropped out a couple months before delivering. <br>  <br>  If you're going to g ofor the generation score, turn on the goddamn tv. And don't blame circuits like MTV, VH1, commercials, etc. It's all over the NEWS, for gods sake. Sex is everywhere everyone is. Teens are just more intruiged by it perhaps because it's uncharted territory. <br>  <br>  Besides that, the teens you mention "get pregnant." SO many teenagers have sex and don't get pregnant because they're at least smart about the situation. It's just the matter between irresponsible teens and responsible teens... most of them are engaging in it.|`|oP504BtFaa	I agree to an extent - I think that could be why teens are having sex, and also why teenage pregnancy is more common with low income families, usually in either bad neighborhoods (can't go out and do things) or in very rural communities (literally can't go out and do things)<br>  <br>  But I also think it lays on the parents, as well. Obviously not all parents are at fault at all, but some are because they may not have taught their children well enough or may not TALK with their children enough.<br>  <br>  I have four fourteen year old daughters and many people literally cringe when they hear that - FOUR. TEENAGE. GIRLS?! How do we manage!? Well, we learned early on that handling ONE teenage daughter in this generation would be hard, so we just did the best we could and try not to stress too much - we educated our girls early on what's right and wrong (sex and boys included within reason) and have always had very open and honest relationships. Had we not done this early on, I can honestly say that I would be a frazzled, sickly looking woman who is extremely bitter, tired and has all gray hair.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	when i was a teen i was excited about going to prom and going on vacations with the family, getting my drivers license so i could go to the mall myself stuff like that. sex was the LAST thing on my mind. even when i did have a boyfriend i was always extremely clear that i would NEVER do anything i wasn't ready for and i sure as hell wouldn't do it without being protected. i also worked as a nurses aide and made honors in school so i had a lot more on my mind then getting with a guy (sexually). <br>  i do think that a lot of teens these days are having sex but i don't understand why they are in such a hurry to grow up. i mean even when i was a teen you know everyone wants to grow up fast and do adult things but having a baby was NEVER in my mind. i don't know what kids think about these days but it scares the hell out of me!
Rbb3rqPQaa	YES! We re not trusted enough, i'm a responsible 15 year old and i've looked everywhere for a job but i'm "too young" grrrr.|`|xtefH34Eaa	Sex is a natural thing, it's not "teens" it's humans... it's animals.  Once ones body goes through puberty we have all of these pressures to ignore it and to put our time into other things.  But to be honest it is a completely natural thing I think if you're smart about it you shouldn't have to ignore these natural urges.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I have school, a job, and I did tell billion sports, and modeling. But I just turned turned fifteen and I'm pregnant. That doesn't mean anything. I spend time with my bf still. This isn't even a question. :)
AA10953561	It sounds like you have a hemorrhoid on the side that's getting the pain. Try not to push too hard when going #2. If you're constipated on a regular basis you may want to talk to your doctor and see if a laxative or stool softener would be a good idea for you. <br>  <br>  And an ultrasound at that time should be pretty accurate it really depends on your baby and technician. If the baby won't show the world his/her private parts then you won't find out. If the technician isn't very good at what they do, you may get the wrong sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|q4gF550Caa	Unfortunately, that's just another glorious part of being pregnant! :) On top of gaining weight, feeling yucky and not being to do certain things, sometimes constipation and unpleasantness when going to do your business just comes along with it. Try drinking lots of water and eating foods higher in fiber. <br>  <br>  Also, no scan is 100%, but with my first they told me she was a girl at 19 weeks and it was right. I'm 32 weeks along now, and I think I'm having a girl, so let's see if they're correct again!|`|drDpM6opaa	hi the scan can be quite right i had my scan last week at 20 weeks 3 days and you could totally tell it was a boy 100% i also have a 2 year old girl i you could tell she was a girl as well at 20 weeks good luck.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's normal to be constipated during pregnancy, and to have hemorrhoids as well.  Make sure to get a lot of fiber in your diet and a stool softener Colace is okay to take during pregnancy as well, it will help with the pain - which sounds as if the fecal material in your colon is either pushing against a hemorrhoid on the way out or your sciatic nerve (lovely).<br>  <br>  Yes they could have determined the sex at 14 weeks even, so as long as the fetus is presenting it's genitals well as sometimes they hide them or in a poor position, the tech can tell you the sex.|`|ROJans2Taa	you could have a fissure or hemorrhoid which are both pretty common due to the strain on the area and pressure from baby, also baby could just be hitting a nerve, in my experience 20 weeks is very accurate for determine sex, with my son, clear as day - penis, no confusing that one, and with my daughter the tech said definitely a girl no questions, best luck

y4TKXkbuaa	Definately ask your GP or MW. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|CWVBfaPwaa	The antibiotics won't hurt anything. If anything it'll almost be prophylactic and you won't get an infection from the c-section.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	your doc would know hte answer to this!|`|6j9Lb83Caa	no i dont think it will have an effect on anything, you probablly just have one off those yuckie colds that comes along with an ear infection,  my guidance coucelar just had a c section done i think sometime last week or the week before that and she had the common cold and was taking medications for it so as long as it has nothing to do with anything inside your tummy you should be fine. just read the labels on the back of the medicanes and it should tell you weather you can take it or not.
pzLDXL6gaa	People can get paranoid especially if they've just started having sex. I know, it's annoying, but I'd rather that paranoia than stupidity the opposite way!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|98WKYtfwaa	I agree with you. I don't see the point in coming on here asking if they are pregnant when it's quite clear they're not, i mean if they're still so unsure or don't believe the tests they've taken why don't they get a blood test from the doctors, i'm sure that would ease their minds more than a bunch of people guessing the result.|`|ZvkX9uNraa	When younger girls have sex unprotected I think that they start to believe they could or are pregnant and make up symptoms. I agree it is annoying to read some of the questions that they ask, although at times it is also amusing.|`|TruIVxqGaa	I agree, but your mind plays tricks on you when you are TTC- everything you experience you question to be pregnancy related. and then of course you have your naive ones. I guess its best not to waste time on questions like those.|`|NCcpjBL5aa	I actually find it quite amusing at times, especially when combined with bad spelling and really dumb a*s questions!|`|TrTfowAQaa	they might be TROLLING knowing we women feel so strongly about pregnancies & babies...|`|1vhPwRRFaa	A lot of people just get really scared and paranoid that they may be pregnant after sex, especially if something happens with the contraception or there was none used. When they start to think about having a baby when they are young or not ready they just freak out and convince themselvesthat they are getting a belly or feel it after just a month.|`|ra7sU4mMaa	Depends maybe they want it so bad for some reason in their  life. So their minds trick them into believing they are. OR they just like the attention, Or they could be so scared of getting pregnant they think that theirs are coming true. Maybe some professional help someone to talk to about fears and advice would be good for them.|`|y4TKXkbuaa	Hear Hear.... If someone dont want to run the risk of falling pregnant...... Get your guy to put something on the god damn end of it, Too many babies are conceived but a quick fumble between the sheets .........|`|6nn7f41Faa	Agreed.|`|P65HdCiOaa	So I'm one of the stupid people! LOL sorry we bug you with annoying questions but it's a scary thing to go through especially when you really have no one to confide in because you don't want everyone to know...and people that have a period and still think there's a chance may be scared because it wasn't a "normal" period and maybe they've never had that experience. Not everyone knows what it's supposed to feel like when pregnant so I think they're just trying to get feedback from other women who do know. It's also people who really really want to be pregnant and are holding on to every small chance that they are actually pregnant and hoping someone else has had the same experience and still come out pregnant...
MubTZUKXaa	I had heavy bleeding two weeks ago.  I had some hospital tests which showed baby was fine.  Later when I got home I lost my mucus plug, I think it was because of the internal tests?  I've read that this can cause the mucus plug to come away.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I've heard it can be normal.  I've been fine since. <br>  At least the hospital told you everything's fine, if they done any tests they would have told you if your cervix was opening etc..  Just be careful and call your midwife if you have any other symptoms.<br>  My Mum, (who has had 8 kids) told me it's very possible to lose the mucus plug during the pregnancy and for it not to mean prem labor.... So don't worry.<br>  <br>  If anything bothers you mention it to your midwife/Dr... you would get better advice from them as they can test/check you and give you advice which would apply personally to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy x|`|F8iyUqJBaa	With my last I lost mine at 34 weeks and dilated to 3.  I stayed that way until 10 days after my "due date" when I finally went into labor|`|98WKYtfwaa	What does your doctor mean there is no such thing? Loosing your mucus plug means you're begining to dialate, it's not a real clue of when your baby is going to come because it could be now or it could be in a few weeks, you should avoid sex and stuff in the meantime as your more prone to infections in there because you've lost the plug.<br>  <br>  Some women loose their mucus plug at 20+weeks and go overdue.<br>  <br>  I would get a 2nd opinion to be 100% certain though.|`|f9495e7282304e6a39024c05d747145baa	i'm 8 months and i started losing my mucous plug too 32 wks. just like you i was having pre-menstrual cramps. going to the hospital, i was dialighted 1 cm and having contractions. because i was ONLY 32 wks, he didn't want me to deliever early, so they just monitored me and sent me home. a wk later i went back to the hospital, still contracting, and dialighting another cm, my doctor gave me a med called NIFEDIPINE to stop the contractions. now the meds work...for me. lil by lil i'm still losing the plug, no blood yet (sry) nor has my water broken, but its still happening. you can go wks before you go into actual labor. for your doc to tell you that there's no such thing as no mucous plug, she's not a REAL doc. i think you should find another one. try going to another doc, or try calling another doc and explain to him/her what's happening and take what they say and weight it with what your doc said. at 32 wks, i explained to my doc's nurse what was happening and she said that i should go to the hospital immediatly and be check out only because her lungs weren't FULLY developed. <br>  agaig, call around and explain what's going on with you and take it from there. i hope that helps! best of luck!!
obN6p3Cgaa	Painful for  a short time. but you will over come it.......|`|tZt7fUYYaa	I dont agree with the first answer, asking how much it hurts doesnt have anything to do with being emotionally ready for sex. I wanted to know too and i was 19 when i lost mine. Its did hurt me, not unbearable pain ~(i have since gone through labour recently lol ) and i did bleed afterwards. My experience wasn't great and not with someone i should of been with. I think if your ready make it as comfortable as possible, in a nice place with candles and music or whatever. Make sure you feel relaxed and not tense as that will not help your feelings. I hope your okay and whatever you do USE PROTECTION!|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	The younger you are the more its gonna hurt because your body isn't ready for it. You might think your ready for it but your body wont be physically, if your body isn't properly developed its going to hurt, its not difficult to work that out.<br>  <br>  However i was old enough and when I lost mine it didnt hurt at all, I waited and it paid off|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	When I lost mine it was uncomfortable, I am not going to lie. I did not bleed though like some girls do. Just make sure you are relaxed and not tense up. Have lots of forepay to get you moistened down there so it's not dry. You may want to use some lube if you are because that could irritate you. Please make sure he uses a condom. You don't want to get an STD or pregnant right now. Just enjoy the moment and make sure he's the right one!|`|wObmwK1uaa	it didn't hurt me at all, i didn't bleed or anything although it is different for every person, just make sure you have lots of foreplay before then your body won't be as tense.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Well if you have to ask a question like this then you are really not ready emotionally and physically for a sexual relationship.|`|OsHJ9Mcqaa	Personally, when i lost my virginity i didnt find it hurt that much. I didnt bleed or anything like that, there was some discomfort when i was walking afterwards but that went away like the next day. <br>  <br>  Of course, i cant tell what it will be like for you, it varies from person to person. My friend bled when it happened to her, whereas i didnt. <br>  Just relax, lots of foreplay, dont rush into anything because if your tense your vagina muscles will tense up too, making it tighter and more painful.<br>  <br>  Use contraception, because as much as it may hurt you know, a baby coming out will hurt a hell of a lot more.<br>  <br>  good luck xx|`|O1Xm6X7Iaa	It varies for different people. When I lost my virginity it didn't hurt too much but felt uncomfortable afterwards - it did however hurt every time I had sex after that for a while, quite badly.<br>  <br>  How old are you? If you are quite young then it may hurt more as your vaginal muscles will be less developed than an older person.<br>  <br>  Use protection!|`|oiB4KATuaa	It doesn't hurt that much, it feels kinda uncomfortable and nice at the same time, just make sure your boyfriend is gentle with you and if it does hurt that he will stop and not put pressure on you..|`|zDYphWwvaa	different for everyone<br>  on a scale of 1-10 mine was 12!
4V4m2uZ5aa	I'm around 5 weeks pg and I've noticed the same thing. In the mornings sometimes I'll stretch and feel a sharp pain. It has scared me too but honestly I think we're ok. I can understand why you're a little nervous but try not to be. (I really need to take my own advice. lol)<br>  My HGC level on the day I was going to start my period was 98 and my dr said that was fine, so your's is good too.

Your hcg seems wonderful!  Good luck and lots of prayers to you and a healthy baby!

It's one of those things that is still just up to nature.|`|VHHis05Naa	Some people believe you can sway to better the odds of having one sex or the other.

iVcaB9h7aa	The greatest scientific minds haven't been able to come to a consensus on your question, so I must base my answer on opinion.<br>  <br>  Clearly many things are determined by genes: eye color, facial features, susceptibility to disease, and on.  But research indicates the environment can influence how these genes are expressed.  They aren't operating in a vacuum.<br>  <br>  I see in myself the combination of genetics and environment.  I'm tall like everyone else in the family, I'm thin just like them, but I don't have my mother's unshakable faith, my dad's scientific brain nor my sister's competitive streak. <br>  <br>  So I'm just me: a 50/50 blend of what I was born with combined with the experiences of a lifetime.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Both are very important however Genetics (nature) trumps all else.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ex. child prodigies.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	At LEAST a 50/50 spread between nature and nuture - although since finally meeting my bio family - genetics is an amazing thing.<br>  My sister and I - look the same - read the same books growing up - took the same subjects in highschool electives - were good at the same sports - and now - we finish each others sentences.<br>  And we lived apart for 36 yrs.<br>  When you've lived apart from those that a bio related - then later you find them - only then can you see how it all really works.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	DNA wins every time. We are all born with a predetermined set of characteristics.  <br>   <br>  If we are placed with adoptive parents who are nothing like us, whether it is looks, intellectual capabilities, musical or athletic abilities, we struggle with our identity even more. Those traits are in our wiring, and if they are not nurtured or respected, it's extremely difficult. <br>   <br>  When I finally met with members of my n family, I saw just exactly how powerful genetics are. I was separated by 2000 miles and 42 years, yet we were so much alike, it really freaked me out. <br>   <br>  I tried to deny genetics, saying that I was a lot like my a family. I think that was a self protective thing for me. I do share things with my a family, but they are on superficial level. How could I NOT share things with them, they are my family and I have been with them my whole life. <br>   <br>  But again, I am more like my first family. While meeting them gave me a sense of belonging that I had been missing my whole life, it also made my loss more profound to me.

Even brothers and sisters with the same parents differ. They share many genes, but not exactly the same.<br>  <br>  Their environments are not identical, either, because the parents change and grow older.<br>  <br>  Studies at the U of Minnesota Twin and Adoption Research Center have shown strong similarities between separated identical twins.Biological family members show similarities not found in control groups. The U of Colorado Adoption Project is also showing genetic similarities, not found in adopted family members.<br>  <br>  So, my conclusion to your question would be that genetic influences are much greater, but there are many variations within genetic configurations.|`|UO1QE8phaa	Who I am?

But I also think that going through life, we are shaped by our experiences and relationships-- otherwise we would be permanently stuck at an infant level in our emotional and mental growth and development.<br>  <br>  (To give one example, to be blunt if our personalities and emotional states were totally hardwired from birth, any significant Primal Wound effect on personality or long-term emotional state would by definition not be possible. Separation from the mother is not a genetic factor, it's an experiential one, even if it happens early on. People who argue for both genetic determinism and a Primal Wound confuse me, because they logically should cancel each other out, rendering any pain from loss a minor rather than a major factor in personality formation if genes are believed to completely determine who we are.)<br>  <br>  All this to say, both, and the proportion of each varies from person to person.|`|RrgQUT5vaa	This is a hard question when I think about my 3 oldest kids (all of my kids have the same nmom but 2 different ndads).  The ndad of my older kids is a diagnosed sociopath and is very, very scary.  His dad is a sex offender.  I don't want my children to be like either of them.  I don't want my boys to grow up and hurt people the way these two men hurt them.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, their nmom was a very sweet lady and she was my friend.  Her biggest fault was that she didn't protect the kids because she was so scared of these people herself.  She did her best though and I truly believe that she loved the kids with all of her heart.  She passed away last August and I would be very proud if my children had her sweet, kind nature.|`|7aCH91ISaa	I think Both are equally important. I can raise my son by my beliefs, but he got so much from his bio parents.<br>  <br>  *his beautiful green eyes<br>  *is natural athletic ability in almost any sport <br>  *his great sense of humor<br>  *his ability to solve almost any math problem. <br>  *his stubborn streak<br>  *his great laugh<br>  I could go on an on about what he inherited from his Bio family.

I am just trying to guide him as he grows up.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	As a reunited adotpee, I believe nature trumps nurture.  Both play a role, of course, but the deep, instinctual foundation upon which everything else is built is completely DNA.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Nature|`|yEzCKWzEaa	Genetics.|`|w2NA1KuXaa	How I was raised has some effect, but once I found my first family it was evident that genetics played a huge role in who I turned out to be.  My sister and I particularily are very much alike, in looks, attitude, personality, everything.  And after meeting members of my dad's family, Ive found out a lot more about myself, and why things are the way they are.|`|BOia61xbaa	I have some very basic scientific knowledge on the subject (mainly through the discovery channel ha ha) and from what I've seen genetics determine personality traits and habits in ways we would not imagine. However, these traits can be expressed in an endless number of ways that are affected by the environment. Siblings raised in the same household and even identical twins have similar genes/identical genes and therefore have a greater chance of having things in common but they are not carbon copies of each other.This is because their life experiences and goals determine how genetic information will be used in real life (if that makes any sense). I was raised by my mother and had very sporadic contact with my father who lives in another country. My mother and I have opposite tastes and moral values so I always thought I took after the parent who did no raise me and that the genes he had given me determined my identity. However, when I met him I realized that this was not the case. My mother and I have the same temperament, drive and head strong approach to life we just happened to be raised in different times with different trends and this affected the way our genetic potential manifested.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	everyone's different. some people form opinions and ideals etc based on their own thoughts while others learn and pick them up from others. Two people living in the same environment with identical factors can still have different reactions to it to the other one. People react to life situations in different ways. They can collect stats, facts and figures, but when dealing with individual people you kind of need to ignore them and take it as an individual case and don't stereotype people. Some people barely remember their pasts and keep moving on with their past barely even touching their subconscious, while for others it's a deeply rooted part of who they are. And for these people, their reaction is still individual.|`|ZDB9Jermaa	Well I hope its more about nurture an less about nature. I live in foster care and I would not want to be anything like my birth parents. The people who raise me have college degrees, haven't had any problems with the law and keep their jobs. They are also the kind of people others like to be around, they have friends, their neighbors don't hate them, and even people who dislike them show them respect. My parents are the opposite of everything I wrote and some more. I try to control my temper and be more like my family. In a way I guess I am a lot like my parents but I consciously decided not to follow them so in the end it might be my will to be different than anything else. I am never going to drink because I read that if your parents are alcoholics the kids have more risks of being alcoholics themselves. The bad genes are there but I'm going to fight them.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Since I was raised by my parents I have to say genetics. I am compassionate, loving, caring, anti-social, shy, most of the time understanding. If it goes by how I was raised. I was called out of my name very often by my mother. I was told on a regular basis that I was an "accident" and when I turned 12 how I was a "mistake". How I was suppose to be a still born. (I didn't find out my mom actually tried to kill me while she was pregnant until I was 20. Apparently my father talked CPS out of taking my brothers..) My mom had no prenatal care while pregnant with me.And I was told daily how I was unlovable by my mother. She couldn't love me because I was a girl. This is how she listed her favorite kids: Damian, Roman, Kyle, Shady (whom has no relation to us), me-Allison, and her step daughter Kelly. And if you like you can add Tabby my cousin in front of me.<br>  I am glad every time I told on her for slapping me in my face when I was little that my dad beat her. You don't hit your children because they ask a thousand questions. Yes I know I was a bit slow at speech thanks to lead poisoning that she complained about having to bring me to the doctor. At one point in time once a week, but normally once a month. It was my fault I had lead poisoning. Go figure. Sot it before I was 6 months old and the doctors told them I was going to be brain damaged.<br>  I am a lot like my grandmother on my father's side. Nothing like my mom and her mother. They are evil people. My grandmother even slapped me in my face when I was 8. I found $20 she took it I told her I hated her she slapped me. Don't worry she died of cancer. Deserved it. My mom is slowly dying from Hepatitis C she keeps giving herself 6 months. She been dying for the past 12 years.<br>  Sorry I really dislike her. She has hurt me more than anybody could. No wonder I haven't left my husband. He is just like her.|`|in6Iw3BEaa	There was a study once done where identical twins were separated and raised by very different kinds of parents and when they reunited, they had so many things in common, mannerisms, the same kind of quirks, the same taste in many things.<br>  <br>  I also do believe that life's experiences shapes a person too.  <br>  <br>  I think nature and nurture both play a role in the development of personality.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	omg my genetics!!! i am NOTHING like my afamily. it has been a struggle all my life and just the last few years we have come to the point to 'agree to disagree' and its working out very well<br>  <br>  ask anyone that knows lori and myself-we literally finish each others sentences and even say the exact same thing at the same time. its EERIE. i often comment that we share a brain. <br>  i talk like her, ooze sarcasim like her, wave my hands around and make the oddest facial expressions like her. we also share many political and cultural and even religious views. (or lack there of) <br>  <br>  my afamily and i dont agree on any of that. <br>  <br>  nuture my have gotten my where i am....but nature makes me who i am. there is NO doubt about that.|`|sBMY7Pe8aa	As an adoptee in reunion, my personal experience is that I am 90% nature with a dash of nurture.  To follow up on a previous answer, the Primal Wound can NOT cancel out genetics.  If anything, it just further masks our *authentic* selves.  And therefore the traits that come glimmering through, despite lack of reflection in those around us?   They probably would have been dazzling in the right context and "nurturing" environment.<br>  In many, many ways, I am resentful not to have grown up with people who have turned out to have so much *in common* with me.  However, some friends have recently asked--- "What if you did grow up with your first parents?  Is it possible that you would have resented hearing how similar you are and possibly rebelled against the numerous traits that you all shared?<br>  Woulda shoulda coulda.  <br>  Bottom line?  My first parents and I share so many bizarre likes and dislikes, mannerisms, attitudes and perspectives that it's mindblowing.  <br>  Most importantly-- all the things about me that used to bug me?  They have become rather endearing, after seeing them mirrored in my parents.....  <br>  There is nothing unique or special about me.  <br>  I am merely a slave to my DNA.....|`|HtiVTA0jaa	I think it is a mix of both.  I definitely have things that came from my parents and now that I know part of my bio family, I definitely have things that come from them.  And a lot of stuff is the result of an interaction between genetics and how I was raised.|`|frpCK0utaa	i believe both are equally important. Genetics at times can outweigh things, but not always.|`|c25cb87e66958bd8797f85c0799bb7c9aa	I am some of both my morals come from who i was raised with but a lot of my personality comes from my genetics.|`|Alyvp37Maa	Nature with a pinch of nurture.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	I'm not adopted but I can see in my son that it is a mixture of genetics and how he was raised so about 50-50.|`|mFInMKSaaa	The way you were raised.  If it was Genetics then the generations would never change.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	I think it is both. Children seem to be born with personalities and talents. And some of those traits run in families, as does ADHD, musical talent, diabetes, etc. How children are raised determines what they do with their personality traits, and how much they develop those talents. Research has shown that two kids with similar genetics can turn out very differently, depending on whether they were well fed, encouraged, and educated. Lack of stress is a big factor, too. What could be a stubborn trait in one person, could develop into perseverance and never quitting in another person.<br>  We all know people whose parents are in jail, or otherwise not the best role models. Yet, these people turned out fine. They did not turn out to be like their parents. <br>  On the other hand, we have all seen people whose childhoods were rough. Some became very successful in life, and some could not overcome the bad treatment they received and developed attitudes that caused them to make bad decisions and have an unhappy life.<br>  I hope this helps answer your question. When you add to it, I'll try to help more.

Faith however, is a cute name. <br>  Jade Marie - (8/10) Cute, traditional and feminine.<br>  Hannah Jane - (8/10) Sweet and also very traditional.<br>  Ellie Rose - (10/10) I love this name. VERY Feminine, sweet and attractive. One of my favourites. (;<br>  Leah Ashley - (7/10) I don't really like the name ashley, but together with Leah, it's really cute.<br>  Lynsey Victoria - (9/10) Lynsey is very nice, it's not as common as most of the names on the list and combined with Victoria, it's a classic.<br>  Lauren Joanne - (8/10) Two sweet names combined. Adding Joanne at the end makes the name less boring. I like it.<br>  Rachel Jessica - (6/10) Both names are okayy.. but it's too common; and i know that you said your sister doesn't like unusual or wierd names - but these are just slightly too 'normal'.<br>  louisa May- (7/10) I like this name, but it sounds a little old fashioned. I like how the names flow together though. (;<br>  Erin Charlotte - (10/10) I love the name Erin. It's vibrant and quirky - but in a good way. Charlotte is more tradional and classy. So together they make an interes0ting pair. Cute, Pretty and overall, a great name.<br>  Emma Juliet - (10/10) It's timeless, modern and beautiful. I love how Emma is a cute simple name, but when put together with Juliet, it seems elegant and quaint. :)<br>  Amy Annabell - (9/10) Love how both start with the same letter.

But maybe she will like it?<br>  2/ Leah Ashley - The combination of the names doesn't sounds like one person.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should ask your sister what kind of personality she wants her daughter to be and base on those quality you might find a suitable name?

ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, I have to admit the dates don't really add up.   If you and her had sex in December.  December 18th to be exact, that means she was ovulating when you had sex with her and her period must have been like December 4th.  One month would be January 4th, she would be 4 weeks, February 4th she would have been 8 weeks.  Let me find an online pregnancy calculator.<br>  <br>  Her estimated due date should be, September 10th, and it's shown she should be 13 weeks and 3 days pregnant.  Hmmmm. . . .  I admit that doesn't add up.  That would also explain why her belly has gotten bigger.<br>  <br>  That's around the time most women start to pop.  You may need to have a liiittle chat with her and ask when her last period was, etc. . . and offer the information I just gave you.<br>  <br>  Take care!<br>  <br>  Edit:  I am 5 weeks and 4 days pregnant right now and my last period was January 28th and got pregnant "technically" in February as that's when I was ovulating.  So, hopefully that shines a light on what she's trying to claim.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Possible reasons for a large abdomen at 3 months OTHER than lying about the date the pregnancy was conceived include plain old overeating (a pregnant woman only needs 300 extra calories a day, about the equivalent of half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but many women eat far more than that because they are "eating for two" and use it as an excuse to pig out) and a multiple pregnancy (ie twins, triplets, etc).<br>  <br>  You have bigger issues with your relationship right now than whether or not her child was fathered by you though.  If you are both at all interested in making this relationship work then you both need to attend marriage counseling and get some help.  If she's not interested in continuing a relationship with you and you do not believe that the child is yours then you always have the option of demanding paternity testing before committing to child support.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	It probably is your baby, dude.. I got pregnant around that exact same time (about Dec. 22) and my baby is due Sept. 15.... I'm a little over 3 months along now and I DEFINITELY have a bit of a belly going poking out.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Bellies can grow quick, but I would get a DNA test!|`|Q8tf4B5taa	If she had a period in dec and not one in jan the she would have fallen pregnant in dec. Unless the period you are describing was an implantation bleed and not a period then she would have fallen pregnant in nov. If you defiantly had sex with her on the 18 dec that would make her now around 13 weeks pregnant, so she will be starting to show a bump and may be retaining water that could make her look bigger. Let her calm down and try and talk to her in a few weeks, perhaps ask her what is wrong and maybe ask her is she is positive this is your baby, because at the end of the day you have a right to know.|`|mxixfE3Raa	It's possible it could be either way. Some women get very big in early pregnancy becase they over eat and bloat alot. Also bumps start forming at different times.<br>  <br>  At the same time it might not be yours and the child could have been concieved earlier than she said, but i'm sorry but it would be very stupid of her to lie about when a baby was conicieved, seeing as everyone knows how long a pregnancy lasts on average. Obviously there are special cases, but I can't see it very likely that she thinks she can give birth early and have you think that the baby is premature.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you're just paranoid, she might just be a little bigger than normal. All you can do is talk to her about it and if you want, have a test done when the baby is born.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|y4TKXkbuaa	Remember your dealing with a hormonal pregnant lady and we can be lethal when we get going. Anyway, Some ladies can grow very quickly, At 3 months someone thought i was over due, and i was huge!!! I wouldnt accuse her of anything until you have solid proof. She need you now more than ever, Pregnancy/birth/early days are bloody hard, and she needs support not hassle. Just let her know your there for her right now until baby is born and a DNA test can be done.<br>  <br>  Good luck
M2XQMPNNaa	I suppose it is to late to try and resume breastfeeding? WHile I realize that you had a difficult time and it may have SEEMED like your daughter was miserable with it, now her history shows that she is miserable with ALL types of feedings, more indicative of a digestive difficulty such as acid reflux. All the switching of formula isn't going to help if she i having pain and difficulty each time she eats due to the reflux!! Therefore, the most easily digestible source would be the breastmilk. I realize that by now your milk may be irretrievably gone, I just wanted to suggest it if it was at all possible. What a shame your pediatrician didn't reccomend a formula when suggesting the soy!! I would try based on your friends experiences more than commercial appeal. I wouldn't be surprised if there is not a dramamtic improvement though, as it seems quite likely she is suffering with reflux. You can try and help her in the mean time by being sure to not lay her down after she eats. She is much better off kept as upright in your arms (preferred0 or if you need to have your hands free sitting as upright as possible in her swing or even carseat. Keeping her more upright after feeding helps to avoid the food rising to the top of her stomach and inducing spasm. Laying flat  makes this worse. I realize you must be worn out, it is very stressful having an infant who is miserable AND trying to keep up with your other chldrens needs as well as your own! take heart in the upcoming appt. helping to get a solution and in the mean time swaddle her and give her lots of love and try and remember that this is a temporary situation and WILL improve with proper treatment and care. good luck. P.S. If you feel that your Dr. is not addressing your concerns and isn't pursuing the reflux diagnosis, don't hesitate to just straight out ask for a referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist. You and your baby deserve to get to the bottom of her troubles and get to a solution so you can all finally relax and actually enjoy being a family.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I don't see how Soy would work if Nutramigen didn't.  Did you give her enough time to adjust to each of these formulas?  That's an awful lot of switching in just 8 weeks.  I did use the Similac Isomil, which seemed to do better with my daughter for about a week, only for her to develop problems with that.  I then switched her to Similac Alimentum, and she's a different baby.  I noticed a change within 24hrs, and had a completely different baby with in one week.  What ever you do switch to, give it some time.  All that switching is probably messing with her system too.<br>  <br>  I also use Dr Brown bottles, and I think they helped a ton with my daughter.|`|LbwpUA1caa	You are in a tough place.  Here is what I do.  I lay the baby on his back.  I grasp the babies feet, bend the knees and push his feet up to his chest.  I pump the baby several times like this and this helps him to get rid of the gas.  Babies develop gas because they don't have the bacteria in their gut that we have yet.  Sometimes a gentle massage of their abdomen helps also.  Make sure when you feed the baby that you feed only 2 ounces then burp the baby and feed another couple of ounces.  Try that for awhile.  If absolutely nothing will calm the baby and you are at your witts end it is ok to put the baby in a safe place and go to a part of the house where you can't hear him.  Turn on some music and relax.  Many people claim that a lot of things help.  But really by the time they have tried a ton of things the colic goes away and they think that it was the last thing that they tried that worked.  That is why I say try some techniques to help get rid of the gas since not much can be done to prevent it, then get some rest for yourself.
vJEatJFPaa	When shes hungry she'll eat. When Olivia was 3 months she took around 4 to 5 ounces every 2 1/2 to 3 hours.<br>  <br>  I would express more milk then that amount for 8 hours.|`|723QHuicaa	If thats all your getting out, I presume thats all your body is making for her because thats all she has been taking from the breast. After nursing (well, not straight after) you could pump what you can and freeze it and build up a little bank in the freezer, that way if you dont get much out, you can thaw some for the next day.|`|kyQPY0LTaa	Each child is different. I am a mom of two. My first was bottle fed and my 2nd was breastfed. <br>  <br>  Obviously you work overnight. and most babies only have one bottle in the time that you are gone. Unless she wakes up in the middle of the night for a bottle. First see if she is content with the amount that you are able to produce. I actually wasnt producing enough milk after I went back to work so I had to supplement with formula also. Just make sure that its only you know once a day that she has formula. <br>  <br>  Try and pump during the day at home also and store breastmilk in the freezer. whenever your baby isnt eating pump that should get the breast milk flowing better and that way if you cant produce enough at work there are spare bags in the freezer. <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|6nn7f41Faa	Is that for one feeding?<br>  <br>  My son is about 15 weeks old as well, and he's a little piggy. It all depends on the weight and personality of the child. My son is 15lbs and he eats every 2-3 hours (Piggy, see?). If I've pumped and he eats from a bottle, he takes anywhere from 7-8oz each feed.<br>  <br>  Does she sleep through the night yet? I've found that I tend to pump out the most first thing in the morning, because my son sleeps right through. If I try to pump through the day, I never seem to pump even a full feed, but first thing in the morning, I can pump out 2-3 meals for him. One he gets, and the other two go to the freezer.<br>  <br>  But 5-7oz will not be enough, if it's just one feed in those 8 hours. If it's 5-7oz per feed, for every 3-4 hours, then it just may be.|`|5puE2Qfpaa	Not at all. You need to mix some cereal in with it. You also might have to cut the nipple on the bottle just a little so it will come out. The doctor put my baby on it at 3 WEEKS because she was not getting enough. She was constantly hungry. A baby eats about 2-3 ounces every 2 hours. I hope this was helpful.
FOUCV6Cmaa	Defiantly show off that belly.  It's the one time in a womans life you have a huge belly and have a wonderful reason for it :) Flaunt that belly|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I'm almost 35 weeks and I show off my belly for the world to see!  Like you couldn't miss it at this point anyhow....<br>  Its also hard to sit.  Walking is fine.|`|6ITgXvBWaa	I find it kind of weird that you are asking all these questions. I dont know why, but something seems suspicious to me.<br>  <br>  I'll answer anyways. <br>  <br>  Im only 17.4 days so I havent gotten to the big belly part yet.<br>  But I will be showing off my big belly. Im not going to wear baggy clothes to hid it at all.|`|ddS7unC2aa	My past four pregnancies have been a 1, but this last one is kicking my butt so I'm going to say a 4.....it's painful to walk and to stand up from sitting.
ehvzQRkkaa	Maybe, maybe not, there is no way of knowing! <br>  Your water can break before any dilation!|`|kw80YHMLaa	ya that was your mucous plug leaving your body. u could go at any time now|`|Q8tf4B5taa	As soon as you lose your mucus plug labour can happen anytime, Not every bodies waters break though i had to have my broken both times. So if your contractions start ring the hospital to let them know don't wait for your water to break aswell.|`|etUFe6tJaa	Mine broke soon after I lost my mucous plug.  Literally it only took less than a minute after!<br>  <br>  I think it helps because soon after I lost my mucous plug I laid down on bed. Good luck!
mSEwby9waa	most sensitive test for ovulation is ultrasound <br>  other tests r cervical mucous test - wat u hav to do is just insert ur finger in to ur part and check the quality of mucous if it is good in quality i.e. fibre can be formed by it then it is time of ovulation<br>  normally ovulation occurs 14days before you bleed<br>  other method is basal body temperature body temp.increases just before ovulation - u hav to just prerpare a body temp.chart<br>  my mail is josephj40@ymail.com<br>  i m a doctor<br>  all information are true and authentic i usually perform ultrasound for ovulation at my clinic|`|ecbe0658102674f8ad91e0162ac2a91faa	Your breasts are definitely connected to your hormonal life.<br>  Normally that the hormones determine also your periods, your ovulation...<br>  <br>  I do not know quite much about the ovulating period, especially as you say you have an irregular period.<br>  <br>  What I can say you for sure, is that e.g. the Folic Acid gives also sore breasts. I'm taking Ferrous pills for anemia (with Folic Acid - which I'll change in short time), and I had to buy other bigger bras.<br>  Folic Acid may also be cancerous!!! Sometimes even the medical practitioner can be stupid, in my Country, sorry!<br>  <br>  About the ovulation in relation with your irregular periods ... it's to be discussed with your gynecologist.<br>  Any of your saying may be true ?!?<br>  <br>  Check with your gynecologist!
DiNZ0Joraa	my son is six months old and he's getting in the crawling position but falls flat on his face..lol. He does scoot foward in a sitting postion and pushes himself backwards on the floor. <br>  <br>  Ive been in the early childhood feild for 14 years and Ive seen babies crawl at all different ages... six months probably the earliest.... but by the sounds of it your child is on her way! Good luck! cause once she realizes she's moblie.... is all about tearin mommy's house apart!!! lol|`|Y9mew1mwaa	My son started crawling at about 5 1/2 months. It was very suprising one day he was rolling around and the next he just got up and went and has not stopped since. He is now 7 months.|`|vJEatJFPaa	a week before she turned 6 months Olivia was crawling. she went backwards before she went forwards.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	My son is 7 months old and he army crawls LOL he does get up on all 4's and rocks back and forth like he is going somewhere but only make's it a couple steps and than goes straight to army crawling again. All babies are different and learn at different paces I am sure your little one will be crawling soon just like mine will or maybe they will pass crawling and go straight to walking LOL.|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	My son is nearly 10 months now and he's starting to grab to pull himself up - and he hasn't crawled yet. <br>  <br>  He'll get up on all 4's and rock back and forth, but if he wants to go somewhere (and boy does he go places!) he'll roll.  Roll and roll and roll and then get up on his stomach and use his hands to turn himself in the direction he wants to go in (or just to get a look around) and then roll, roll, roll.|`|LUjCnYmoaa	Yesterday! he is almost 9 months old and he started yesterday, he was doing the army crawl for a day and the day before that he figured out how to go from his tummy to sitting. <br>  But at the same time he is always pulling himself to stand.<br>  so many milestones at once!|`|IDS64Eh8aa	My daughter kind of by-passed the crawling, she bum-shuffled from around 7 months and now she's pulling herself up and trying to take a few steps while holding onto something. She'll be 8 months next week|`|1enIWBGnaa	6-months is about the time an infant will sit and begin crawling.  At 6-months they are slowly developing some motor skills and they just experiment with everything.
H0fXySX9aa	with my second i felt her moving at 14 weeks so anything is possible hun|`|GxYtTjUbaa	It could be ur baby most women notice it sooner than others. I'm 13 weeks waiting to feel my little one I'm pregnant wit my second hopin for a baby boy|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I'm about 13 weeks and I can feel baby moving.. and I don't know why people insist that the baby is "REALLY small" at this stage because it's about 3-4 inches long by now! That's pretty long! Not to mention that it the baby fills up the uterus by now so it's not really THAT small and it's certainly not too small to feel if it's moving!|`|a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	I don't really think it's the baby bc the baby is still really small.  But if you want to believe it is and that makes you happy then I say go ahead and think it's the baby.  You'll feel him/her soon enough and a happy pregnancy means a healthy baby.  Good luck.|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	I started feeling this baby move at around 14 weeks, but it was a little more obvious to me. But this is my third time pregnancy. When my baby moved early on, that's the spot I felt the movement though, so I think it's your baby. Yay! :)|`|sRvgHISSaa	yes i think it sounds like your feeling your baby's first movements its such a nice feeling like butterflies in your lower tummy by 19 or 20 weeks you should feel your first proper kicks x good luck with it all hun xx|`|ZvkX9uNraa	I felt the exact same thing when I was at 15 weeks. Everyone kept telling me that it couldn't be the baby because it was too early. Although it continued to get stronger until I felt actual kicking at 18 weeks. Do not listen to those who tell you it is too early because its all about the person and how in tune you are to your body.|`|TrTfowAQaa	sounds like your intune with your body... I was feeling stuff at 12 weeks felt like flutters ... now that i'm almost 20 weeks and i've been feeling her punch kick & roll around for 3 + weeks now I believe what I felt that early was stretching of all the tissues making more room... but as I type this I feel her knocking around down there. i'm also rather small 5'3" and WAS 107 when I got pregnant so I can feel the girl hitting my hand and have for 3 weeks....so sounds like you start feeling some really great things around the next week...congratulations and welcome mother-to-be-hood!|`|f6391b0b92f0565b5a109f16dc70afdfaa	Im pregnant with my #2 and I started feeling bubbles and slight movements at 14 weeks. Now I am 19 weeks and I can feel flutter and gentle pokes. So it could be the baby soon u will be able to tell for sure!<br>  <br>  Good luck with ur pregnancy!<br>  <br>  xx
758cDKEFaa	i suggest see your doctor.<br>  you and your partner can get tests done to see if there is any problem.<br>  he may have a low sperm count or your ex may have done some damage your unaware of yet.<br>  the best thing to do is get checked over, they usually say to see a doctor if you havent fell pregnant after a year of trying.<br>  you may need clomid to help indcue ovulation so your more likely to get pregnant.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	Maybe the stress from trying so hard is not letting you get pregnant. Are you trying on your most fertile days....about 14 days after the first day of your period? It's been a year I would say both of you may need to get checked out from your doctors just to see what's going on.|`|7101ca25abf1e27ea43268cf9eca7944aa	Just don't try so hard, take your time it will happen when you are ready, having 3 miscarriages it could be playing on your mind.|`|d752626a8e04d590b5de05ddff20f574aa	Go and have some tests done to make sure your ok and are able to fall pregnant.|`|dkevqCtkaa	Hi there, it can be perfectly normal for getting pregnant to take some time, however if you are both otherwise healthy then maybe you should make an appointment with your gp to discuss things . otherwise if you smoke, think about cutting down or quitting (your boyfriend too) . alcohol intake can also affect things sometimes. The biggest thing is to relax and enjoy the process, as your body is more likely to respond when you are un stressed. Your doctor will be able to help you explore any other methods or maybe suggest medical assistance if appropriate. don't give up hope yet, there are many ways to achieve what you want, and holding your baby will be all the sweeter because of your struggle. good luck!|`|OsHJ9Mcqaa	Dont lose hope, it can months, even years for someone to get pregnant. It isnt an easy task to get pregnant, afterall you have to get it right on that one certain day a month.<br>  <br>  To put your mind at rest, go to the doctors and have some tests done. <br>  Also, the stress from wanting to get pregnant may be affecting your chances of doing so, stress does funny things to the body.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|DEacde81aa	Your partner might have a low sperm count?<br>  Or maybe your ex beat you so bad he might have done something to your tubes and ovaries.<br>  I suggest you make an appointment with you doctor, they can check you both out and give you suggestions.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	EDIT: Alright, never mind, I reread and found it isn't your current boyfriend who beats you.<br>  <br>  Has he been tested to see how fertile he is?
AlxMp9l3aa	HI i would ask your doctor for a blood test, these are very accurate and measure the hcg levels:<br>  Guideline to hCG levels during pregnancy:<br>  hCG levels in weeks from LMP (gestational age)* :<br>  <br>  3 weeks LMP: 5 - 50 mIU/ml <br>  4 weeks LMP: 5 - 426 mIU/ml <br>  5 weeks LMP: 18 - 7,340 mIU/ml <br>  6 weeks LMP: 1,080 - 56,500 mIU/ml <br>  7 - 8 weeks LMP: 7, 650 - 229,000 mIU/ml <br>  9 - 12 weeks LMP: 25,700 - 288,000 mIU/ml <br>  13 - 16 weeks LMP: 13,300 - 254,000 mIU/ml <br>  17 - 24 weeks LMP: 4,060 - 165,400 mIU/ml <br>  25 - 40 weeks LMP: 3,640 - 117,000 mIU/ml <br>  Non-pregnant females: <5.0 mIU/ml <br>  Postmenopausal females: <9.5 mIU/ml <br>  <br>  The results should come back from your doctor within 24-48hrs.  But you are showing signs of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  With my first i was 3 months pregnant, and had done 5 pregnancy tests over 3 weeks and all came back neg, then i went to the doctors and he did blood test and it came back positive.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|6L4fCcyGaa	When I got pregnant my signs where cramps like I was about to come on my period, then later on I felt like I was on it but I wasn't !!!|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	try takin a test 2 weeks after missed period``|`|wObmwK1uaa	it sounds like you could be pregnant as i had all of these symptoms the best time to take a pregnancy test is in the morning but use urine from the middle of your wee that's what i got told hope it helps x|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Wait a few days and test again.  Be sure to use your first morning urine.|`|peybb4Foaa	Yes i really do.<br>  And it will be a Hermaphrodite|`|djlA8Wpdaa	using my psychic skills i can definitely say yes.yes you are.|`|y4TKXkbuaa	Hi there, the answer is it could be very very possible that you are, The signs you mentioned are pregnancy signs. You say you done a test, what testing kit did you use? as sometimes the HGC levels aren't strong enough to give  positive reading.<br>  <br>  Id highly reccomened FIrst response or the Digital Clear blue one.<br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope you have a positive result x|`|l4gqo2LBaa	Its possible you tested too early for the test to detect the hormone..or like you said the urine could have been too diluted.. <br>  <br>  You could test again using your first morning urine.. try not to drink anything before bed and u should be fine for potency.. <br>  <br>  Or just wait for your doctors appt and ask for a blood test..|`|CaqdDzQZaa	it sounds like you are  wait a couple of days take the test Again it happen to my wife before the test was negtive and it turn out she was <br>  pregnant and it was twins|`|6y7IAMfHaa	Yes. Probably|`|hprR6qfHaa	Irritable bowel syndrome.<br>  <br>  No but really you might be.  Good luck at the doctor.|`|eec685f8de34940a4e941788661cddb1aa	Take an over the counter test. It's possible.|`|Ilt3hH7Taa	I can safley say yes you are|`|cea952f66591ae83de7146c0776cacb4aa	most likely you are|`|8qnAu8SEaa	yea you probably are but this is what i would do. first start by getting another test and take it will the first morning pee in the morning (i have a one year old so i just did this a year ago). i used the test with the 1 line 2 line and it was kinda if-ie cause the lines showed up but it was so hard to see that i was uncertian that i was pregnent, so i when to the digital and it worked way better(cost a little more but it was worth it). remember if you get up early to pee and then go back to bed then that when you take the test do not wait till you are "awake". i hope this works for you cause it worked for me.|`|AMUbmMk7aa	the test was negative so...i would take another. but i know when you are stressed on when your period is going to come or not come....you can actually push it back. My bestest friend was trying to conceive, thought she was prego. she had all the signs of being prego right before she was due for her period she got her self all excited. then she was 1 day late...2 days late...5days late. even more built up excitement came on. then on day 6 or 7 she got her period and was crushed! so just keep this in mind, and don't put all your eggs in one basket. It seems like you just started trying and im sure you will be fine ( = good luck

And buy him a blow up doll!<br>  <br>  Having an abortion is not the answer, if things are that bad then leave him.  people treat abortion like it's like taking a painkiller when you have a headache, if you couldn't have children maybe you wouldn't be so keen to get rid of a baby that plenty of people in the world are trying so hard to conceive, including myself.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be so hard on you honey, but your a grown married woman, and speaking out and telling your husband your not happy about your situation childish, maybe you want to go speak to women who cant have children maybe you might appreciate how precious a baby is.<br>  <br>  I suggest keeping your legs closed unless your husband grows up and starts taking responsibility for his actions.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	get spayed its cheaper and safer than all those abortions, and you wouldnt be considered a murderer of innocent children, because you cant keep your legs shut or you husband to do the right thing...

wZAeBisbaa	Why not try it sometime when one of their parents is around?  You could play with them and care for them while their mom or dad does some work or enjoys some leisure time. You'd get a good feel for what it would be like to look after 2 kids, and if it goes well, both you and the parents may feel confident about your being alone with them.|`|uP08b6K4aa	First I would be asking what times you are being asked to babysit, and also determine how mature and able you are to look after my children.<br>  <br>  There is no law that states a certain age for an individual to babysit so it won't be against the law, it will up to the parents in question to make such a decision as to whether you would be suitable and responsible to care for their children.<br>  <br>  If you feel at all uneasy about it, then I'd enlist the help of your brother for a while.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|ffxqr6wFaa	I don't think the law in the UK anyway sets a specific age for parents leaving their children with babysitters.  I think if the parent feels the babysitter is mature enough to care for the children then that's ok.<br>  <br>  However as mature and as sensible as you are it may be an idea to have your brother there as backup in case the children cry or get upset.|`|DozD8lTGaa	Well, if it is someone you have known for AGES and trust well, then no; it's fine. They clearly trust you.<br>  <br>  My neighbours asked me a few times to babysit for them when i was around your age... i have known them for about 8 + years and we are really close.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, no; it's not a problem. BUT, say for example something happened and the Police turned up at the door... They would question your age and the people you are babysitting for would get into serious trouble because, you are younger than 16... So, taking your brother is really up to you :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope i helped :) x|`|HXpR2bw0aa	If it's the first time I'd ask your brother to come just to be 100% safe. But if you know them well, and are mature for your age then why not? I'm around your age too, and I could easily look after a 5 year old whether I knew them or not, but a 1 year old is a slightly different story.

miOor5SRaa	OPK does not detect ovulation it detects LH . LH is always in our system so you shouldnt use FMU with an OPK because your urine is more concentrated & will give you a false result!<br>  <br>  ***EDIT***<br>  Sorry LH is a hormone our body produces, normally we have a surge in our LH 24-36 hours before ovulation, so if you are using clomid maybe its increasing your bodies LH

That will usually loosen them up and do the trick.  Have you been feeding her solids? Perhaps she is not ready or does not like what you have been feeding her.  Some formulas also cause issues with constipation.  Try only introducing one food at a time (wait until after she gets over this) and then wait a few days using that same food and then gradually add in more foods so her body can adjust each time and so you can see what she doesn't tolerate well.|`|4qTOzcoXaa	It depends on if your baby is exclusively breastfed or if you have introduced a new food. This is new, not a pattern? Sometimes when you introduce solid foods, their little systems take awhile to process them. If you have not yet introduced prunes/prune juice to baby's diet, now is not a good time to try it. Give baby a warm bath and try to "bicycle" his legs. If that doesn't work, I would suggest going to the doctor.|`|LbwpUA1caa	Your baby should wet 10 -16 diapers a day.  He should soil a diaper every 1 - 2 days.

Just all stay together, all try to stand up for each other and try to make more friends with a variety of people, so you can all help each other.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	You could file charges of assault if they throw BRICKS at you!

I realize you like what you wear and you have every right to wear what you like as long as it doesnt go against the school dress code but others may not like it.  They do not have the right to throw things at you though.  The throwing things is a form of assault and it should not be allowed in school.  <br>  <br>  My daughter dresses somewhat emo also, with the Happy Bunny t-shirts and eyeliner--layered hair into one eye, etc...  I think she looks cute.  The look is not extreme--no funky hair colors or anything.  She hasnt been met with any problems from other kids at school though.  If my daughter were getting things thrown at her in school, I would be going to the school and making a huge stink about it.  <br>  <br>  Tell your parents about the assaultive behavior at school and let them go to the principal with complaints.  You also have the right to call police and press charges if you are assulted in school, i.e. hit with anything thrown at you.  I guarantee that if police show up and charges are filed, nobody will be willing to throw things at you again.|`|zrO4h1hqaa	yell at those jerks. im preppy but i have a "scenic " friend (or punk) and she has the layered hair and the eyeliner but its totally ok she fits in. don't have low self esteem they are just have nothing better tio so just stand up to them and make your mark in your school. tell them off. and get like five of you guys to do it. don't it just be you two because it would really help if their are more people saying "hey your wrong shut up leave me alone and then point out all of their flaws or imperfections "|`|6aoJhFp4aa	Tell a school administrator... thats a hatecrime if there throwing eggs and stuff at you... they could get in trouble with the police for it!!|`|bS7DN85Qaa	NoName's right.

gHyu4Hqaaa	I think It could be positive. The longer you have been pregnant the positive line would get darker due as the hormone builds up in your system that us women have when pregnant. So in the very very early stage it may be a very light positive line. I found the test brand called Clear Blue to be the most reliable as if not pregnant there is definitely no positive line at all, as with the cheaper brands It is not always clear as they can sometimes show a very very faint line and its hard to tell what the result should be. Clear Blue in my experience is the best.|`|6nn7f41Faa	Can you post a picture? I have an eye for faint positives.<br>  <br>  That's okay if it's been over 10 minutes, the positive would still be there.|`|AlxMp9l3aa	even if the line is faint you are pregnant go to your doctors and ask for a blood test which is 100%.

Best of luck to you :]|`|EwK9iZj6aa	It's a positive no matter how faint it is! As long as you see the line that indicates pregnancy. The longer into pregnancy the darker the line will be.

But the blood supply directly supporting the growing pregnancy occurs once implantation occurs, when the embryo invades the endometrial lining and encourages angiogenesis (artery and vein formation) around and to the placenta.   Oh yeah, implantation occurs around 10-14 days.

obN6p3Cgaa	Yes......|`|WA9Y8QAEaa	Most definitely, get a pregnancy test and see about that!<br>  Good luck! :)|`|42vC5ztpaa	Are you having any of these other signs... <br>  10. Tender, swollen breasts<br>  9. Fatigue<br>  8. Implantation bleeding<br>  7. Nausea or vomiting<br>  6. Increased sensitivity to odors<br>  5. Abdominal bloating<br>  4. Frequent urination<br>  3. A missed period<br>  2. Your basal body temperature stays high<br>  1. The proof: A positive home pregnancy test<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Could you be pregnant? Most likely you won't notice any symptoms until about the time you've missed a period — or a week or two later.<br>  <br>  If you're not keeping track of your menstrual cycle or if it varies widely from one month to the next, you may not be sure when to expect your period. But if you start to experience some of the symptoms below — not all women get them all — and you haven't had a period for a while, you may very well be pregnant. Take a home pregnancy test to find out for sure!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  10. Tender, swollen breasts<br>  One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  9. Fatigue<br>  Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.<br>  <br>  You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep.<br>  <br>  8. Implantation bleeding<br>  Some women have a small amount of vaginal bleeding around 11 or 12 days after conception (close to the time you might notice a missed period). The bleeding may be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of your uterus — a process that starts just six days after fertilization — but no one knows for sure.<br>  <br>  The bleeding is very light (appearing as red spotting or pink or reddish-brown staining) and lasts only a day or two. (Let your practitioner know if you notice any bleeding or spotting, particularly if it's accompanied by pain, since this can be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy.)<br>  <br>  7. Nausea or vomiting<br>  If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either — pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.<br>  <br>  About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up.<br>  <br>  6. Increased sensitivity to odors<br>  If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you.<br>  <br>  5. Abdominal bloating<br>  Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small.<br>  <br>  4. Frequent urination<br>  Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.<br>  <br>  This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  3. A missed period<br>  If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period.<br>  <br>  2. Your basal body temperature stays high<br>  If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant.<br>  <br>  And finally...<br>  <br>  1. The proof: A positive home pregnancy test<br>  In spite of what you might read on the box, many home pregnancy tests are not sensitive enough to detect most pregnancies until about a week after a missed period. So if you decide to take one earlier than that and get a negative result, try again in a few days.<br>  <br>  Once you've gotten a positive result, ma
FOUCV6Cmaa	Sperm are living cells. They remain healthy within a small range of temperature, moisture, molarity (content of salt and other chemicals in the moisture) and acidity. Sperm which have become totally dry, which have become immeshed into fabric, which have been exposed to destructive forces such as the enzymes in saliva, the heat, soapiness, or lack of balanced salt content in bathwater are unlikely to survive (continue to swim) for longer than minutes.<br>  Pregnancy can occur without intercourse if sperm-rich ejaculate in deposited near the entrance to the vagina: this is a poor way to become pregnant but it has happened.  <br>  I doubt that you could be pregnant cause everything needs to be perfect.  I of course could be wrong just my opinion,|`|BJERgbM5aa	No chance.|`|ROJans2Taa	no, I think your going to be fine, sperm can only live in the air for a very limited time, your chance of getting pregnant is likely around .05%, very slim|`|EwK9iZj6aa	What are you doing having oral sex in the first place?

If they provided one for you they would surely toss 10x the value onto your bill.<br>  <br>  Think about it.

A big part of this is on the parents' shoulders, as well.

VKQzj4Pmaa	Not all babies are the same. Some will adjust well, others will have a horrible time. It's just one of those things your child will have to get use to . . . I'm sorry, but that's what it really comes down to. After a few days, possibly a week, your child will accept this separation as normal and will learn to adjust.<br>  <br>  Whoever is watching your son, just be sure to explain his full schedule and daily routine. Making sure your son wakes up at the same time, naps at the same time, goes to bed at the same time, eats at the same time, etc., could help. Even though mommy isn't with him, his life is still operating the same. That may help.|`|RLtzqQB9aa	if he know them, he should be fine
obN6p3Cgaa	Missed period, Tender breast and cramps........|`|MOsStEbqaa	I just thought i was getting my period. I had cramps and i was tired. But when i was 8 days late i knew i was pregnant.|`|42vC5ztpaa	Could you be pregnant? Most likely you won't notice any symptoms until about the time you've missed a period — or a week or two later.<br>  <br>  If you're not keeping track of your menstrual cycle or if it varies widely from one month to the next, you may not be sure when to expect your period. But if you start to experience some of the symptoms below — not all women get them all — and you haven't had a period for a while, you may very well be pregnant. Take a home pregnancy test to find out for sure!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  10. Tender, swollen breasts<br>  One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  9. Fatigue<br>  Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.<br>  <br>  You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep.<br>  <br>  8. Implantation bleeding<br>  Some women have a small amount of vaginal bleeding around 11 or 12 days after conception (close to the time you might notice a missed period). The bleeding may be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of your uterus — a process that starts just six days after fertilization — but no one knows for sure.<br>  <br>  The bleeding is very light (appearing as red spotting or pink or reddish-brown staining) and lasts only a day or two. (Let your practitioner know if you notice any bleeding or spotting, particularly if it's accompanied by pain, since this can be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy.)<br>  <br>  7. Nausea or vomiting<br>  If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either — pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.<br>  <br>  About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up.<br>  <br>  6. Increased sensitivity to odors<br>  If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you.<br>  <br>  5. Abdominal bloating<br>  Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small.<br>  <br>  4. Frequent urination<br>  Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.<br>  <br>  This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  3. A missed period<br>  If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period.<br>  <br>  2. Your basal body temperature stays high<br>  If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant.<br>  <br>  And finally...<br>  <br>  1. The proof: A positive home pregnancy test<br>  In spite of what you might read on the box, many home pregnancy tests are not sensitive enough to detect most pregnancies until about a week after a missed period. So if you decide to take one earlier than that and get a negative result, try again in a few days.<br>  <br>  Once you've gotten a positive result, make an appointment with your practitioner. Now head over to our pregnancy area|`|0SHOXqb4aa	The first symptom is usually a missed period.  About a week after the date of the expected period, you can start to feel sick, sometimes have sore breasts and have increased vaginal discharge.  Mood swings can kick in around then too.
qdPtCBJeaa	Yes,...and I think we created that in them.<br>  It starts out...come on little one...lets get washed up and get the PJs on....which of course really means Bath, brush your teeth, hair washed.<br>  Its a trick we needed to get them to do what we needed them to do.<br>  And the brats have learned how to turn it around.<br>  <br>  My 8 year old grandson wanted Star Wars Action Figures.....but we came home with the Millenium Falcon......cost me a pretty penny.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	You mean like "Dad, will you buy me a CD?" and you walk out of the store with a CD player or an iPod?  Lol...yeah, I did that to Dad some when I was younger, but I didn't usually get what I wanted.  That's okay because I now have very good money sense.  He taught me the true value of money; and I never died from not getting what everyone else had, lol...|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I don't think there is a kid that doesn't do that if they think they have a shot at it!|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	no they know the rules when we go|`|FvYqKZSMaa	My nieces and nephews try it with me all the time.But it does not fly with Auntie.They have to earn a toy  if they have a good week and only get a set amount to spend or a specific.Like a book a board game or coloring book and crayons.Or a bonce ball out of the machines if they behave in the store if they go to the store with me.|`|NSKimt1Qaa	No, I can't remember my kids ever doing that.  They knew they didn't have to do that "bait-and-switch" with me.  If they wanted something and I had the money for it, I got it for them.  Of course, I tried not to spoil them so, with some exceptions, if it was something that was on the expensive side and they didn't really need it right now, I got it for their birthday or some special occasion. My kids and I had a pretty close, open and honest relationship when they were younger. = )|`|Y8Suz0l3aa	Yes, I am the parent of two teenagers. My son is very good at coercing me to taking him to the game store for a small game, then I end up buying something more expensive. I am a single mom and I have a hard time denying my kids.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I always try to make sure that my son has allowance and when he starts the crap you speak of I suggest that he speak of after I agree to buy it I suggest he spend his own money. He downgrades super fast.|`|AA10236694	my sons 16 and try's to negotiate before we even reach the door of the store . Its like lets make a deal. Im Like how do you play lets make a deal when  one person has no money to deal with Lol|`|3WWHWsHOaa	No. But when I tell mine they can have a toy for X amount of dollars they will try to upgrade about a dozen times before we reach check out. Somehow $20 always turns into $50-100.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Like a toy or something? At five my daughter never asks me to take her to the store for anything, unless she wants a mcdonalds|`|DJMPQlFDaa	no/yes. You see we got to the dollar tree my 4 year old is suppose to get one thing but normally she ends up getting between 2 and 5 things. Depend how much extra cash I have on hand.|`|Oxl4cyCyaa	Yes, of course. Doesn't every kid try to get more than what we went to the store for? <br>  My 11 yr. old & 5 yr. old have a allowance that they cannot go over per month. My 11 y/o's is more of course, but both of them (including my 2 yr. old) tries to get whatever they can when we go to a store. "Can I get this, Can I get that" <br>  That is why I don't usually bring them with me...ha ha my 11 yr old is not as bad, but my 2 yr. old and 5 yr. old are like that. The other day, we went to the store to buy my daughter Leila(2) a new dolly because the dog messed up her other dolly's hair. When we were at the tore she found the doll she wanted to get and next t it was a whole stack of clothes that went with the doll and she started begging me to buy some new clothes for the dolly. So yes it happens, almost every time we go to buy something.|`|x1XFQ43Raa	ahaa, oh yes. my dad's a huge suck up, so i'll tell him i need something realllly bad. and we will go to the store eventually to get it, and then he'll notice something bigger and better, and he will say what about that one, and i'll say yeah, but its more expensive. and he just ends up buying the bigger/better one. that's how it always works. i'm not selfish or spoiled, but when i do go out and get something, that's what usually happens. it goes from something small to big. most of us kiddies know that's what will happen, not like we plan it though. (: hope i helped.|`|US6CnMR1aa	I'm not a parent but that is something that my brother will do all the time and it gets really annoying. Lots of my friends will do it too.<br>  Does that answer your question?<br>  :D Shelb|`|FliqRZIFaa	ima a kid and i do it all the time.<br>  and my dad would be like you came to get this so get it and lets go.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	yes, my 10 year old has figured out that dad is a softy if they get to run around together, she convinced him the other evening that she needed a pack of bubble gum, he took ehr to the store and they came back with 2 bags of stuff,, i swear, i had to confiscate half of it lol.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Yes. My oldest started that was she was younger, and let's just say she's a good teacher. <br>  <br>  Another one they try is in the store beg for something that's, we'll say, $50. Then they offer to "settle" for something for $30. <br>  <br>  Sometimes I wish they weren't so smart(:
UcgWrGaAaa	3 to 4 weeks...you just have to hang in there and soon he is going to give you some smiles and laughs that are going to send you over the moon.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	My daughter smiled socially for the first time at 4 weeks. It won't be long, and it's so amazing when they start "giving back." Good luck!
FHT6wsUpaa	No. But once born and on the outside, they *do* recognize her smell, the sound of her voice, her touch and comfort, and - eventually - can identify her by sight. But as far as being able to label her as "mother" ... that doesn't happen for many months.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UcgWrGaAaa	They can hear your voice and will respond to the mothers voice over others right after birth.  They can feel your emotions because of the hormones that create emotions and occur as a result of your emotions.  The other poster is right, I think their experience is more that you are a part of them.|`|ykP7I3caaa	They wouldn't be really thinking about it, they have no way to think about anything besides what they know. But I'm not sure if they know they're separate, they probably just know it's where they've always lived and what they're used to.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Well, when my son was born we bonded right away and he seemed to recognize my voice, so who knows? :)|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Children are taught that they come from their mother, they don't know it automatically.  So I don't see how a fetus, whose brain is not fully developed and who will not really begin to understand the world at all until months after they are born, could know that.<br>  <br>  Charisma, you seem to have missed the point of the psychologists you are citing.  Babies don't think of the mother as 'being that I am part of' - they have no concept of 'I' at all.|`|i9aVklGVaa	Babies don't "know" but they feel everything.  Your love, your worry, your exhaustion etc.  Babies are closer to the spiritual world than we grown-ups are; they know you, they know your past lives together, etc.  They know a lot that they can't communicate.  They forget as they grow up, as we did.|`|WnUZCcytaa	No|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Even after they are born, newborns don't really understand for a while that they are separate beings from their mother.  So I'd say no.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	babies actually (proven by studies) don't know that they are a seperate being from their mother for the first few months.  I don't think they understand human attatchment to the word "mother" but they do know who thier mother is as the "being that I am a part of"...
H0sPCJQPaa	Awe, <br>  Try finding something else to do with your dad.<br>  or Go with friends to the gun show.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	Listen your not a crybaby or anything like that.You got dissapointed greatly so you have a right to cry!Maybe invite a buddy to go to the show?|`|qFDcKWlbaa	aww ** BIG hug** your not a crybaby! sometimes i just want to go to the mall and look around with my mom but shes too lazy and it upsets me too :(<br>  <br>  maby talk to your dad about how much you just wanted to spend time with him and maby you can go do something for free :)|`|Mjni0Np3aa	You are not being a crybaby. Its perfectly natural to want to spend time with your father. I don't mean to offend you, but I think its selfish what your dad is doing to you. He said he would take you, and now because of $14 he won't. That's ridiculous. I suggest you tell him how you feel. It's not expensive, and it's important to you. He should care about your feelings.|`|vzHVprfDaa	Oh my gosh hunny, You are not a cry baby. Don't let yourself think like that. That is so rude for him not to want to spend 14$ to be with you. He didn't even offer to do something that didn't cost money. Its great that you stepped up and offered to pay but he refused? Yeah in this situation, You are not a cry baby|`|n3h9Byhpaa	Awh, you're not a crybaby at all.<br>  I'm really sorry /:<br>  <br>  Maybe there's another reason behind it, that he really doesn't want to go. Maybe something came up.|`|1PyTzms4aa	No, you're not a cry-baby, i'd probably be doing the same if I was you. My advice is rather extreme : Tell him the exact thing u said here about not being worth $14. And make him feel bad. Maybe he'll eventually understand. This is more extreme, but it is generally good to show him your feelings.|`|uoHkecplaa	No, you are not being a cry-baby. Your dad should spend time with you, and he's not. He claims it's because of the $14, but I think it's something else. I think that you should go sit down with him and tell him how this whole incident made you feel.|`|81hnBpOlaa	Oh god, sweetie your not a crybaby. You just looked foward to bonding with your dad. Just remember a father to son relationship is very sacred
hw85EC1Laa	if you have heavy periods it could just be the pressure of all the blood|`|jpqSnCpuaa	no it isn't your cervix has nothing to do with what happens when you ovulate or having to poop|`|485b0a537e73379bb64ed3928743579eaa	your cervix does not change positions.  when you are having your period you are not ovulating.  Ovulation happens mid-cycle.  Some people have a small amount of cramping when they ovulate, and many people have cramps when they are menstruating.  This cramping is caused by muscle contractions of your uterus, and can feel very similar to having to go poo because all those muscles are so close together in your body.

wXx8RcOvaa	Well as a man I certainly wouldn't want either of those names.  I have heard Courtney used for a man though.  He was a big guy who played basketball for the Minnesota Gophers and I don't think to many people probably teased him about it.   Keep in mind this is the same tool who clocked his girlfriend in the head with a telephone book and sent her to the hospital so maybe she gave him some crap about it and thats what happened.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	nope girls name. Courtney reminds me of corn. That was random!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Both were originally mens names. Whitney was on the Social Security Top 1000 list for men since 1880 and is still in the top 1000 today. It didn't even appear in the womens top 1000 list until 1962<br>  <br>  Courtney has also been a top 1000 mans name since the 1880s but did not appear in the womens top 1000 until 1962<br>  <br>  So both names have only been considered girls names since the 1960s.|`|8S2icURfaa	uuuuuuuuh no|`|tTksfeufaa	i would say not|`|kPl8TTzNaa	They were both male names.

i9aVklGVaa	How long did you let him cry it out?  How many days?  My son was the worst sleeper ever.  He didn'teven sleep 2 hours at a time until 20 mo.  I really suffered. Sleep training books say let him cry 45 min; my son could go more than 2 hours (I'd comfort him every 30 min).  Anyway, before having my second child I just had to sort this out.  Five days of letting him cry as long as he could.  It was agonizing and I thought I was going to go nuts, but now he's just fine, and he is a lot better during the day because he's sleeping more deeply.  GOOD LUCK; this is really hard.|`|AA10590629	Give him a paci or put him to bed with his bottle if he drinks one.|`|8rFLi29xaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  The behaviour you describe is exactly what my DD (now nearly 11 months) does when I am trying to get her to sleep. I feel like she is fighting me, and I've even developed horrible tendonitis in my wrists from holding her while she struggles. The only thing that works (sometimes) is nursing. <br>  <br>  Have you tried putting your son in his cot and staying by him until he drops off, maybe patting him or just talking to him gently and telling him that it's time to go to sleep. He might find it less distressing than being left alone (we tried CIO, didn't work for us either). This worked in the past for my DD, but I have to say, doesn't any more. She got wise and realised if she cries for long enough, we will crack and pick her up. But I thought I would mention it in case it worked for you. If it does, you could then gradually withdraw from the room night by night (eg, at first by the cot, then a little further away, then by the door, then outside the door etc....).<br>  <br>  The other poster said put your baby to bed with a bottle - I think this is a really bad idea - as they can choke on the bottle if it is left propped up for them. Also it rots their teeth...<br>  <br>  I think some babies are just more persistent and find it harder to wind down than others. It is so hard though, and I really sympathise: I am there with you every night!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	It sounds like you aren't putting him to sleep early enough, if you let a baby get too tired they have difficulty going to sleep, or if they don't get enough sleep during the day. <br>  <br>  If that's not the case and its simply a matter of the baby's inborn temperament there is nothing you can do.  He is too little to understand reason, and you do not want to "break" a baby's will even if you could.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200...</a><br>  The age at which babies settle – meaning they go to sleep easily and stay asleep varies widely among babies. Some babies go to sleep easily, but don't stay asleep. Others go to sleep with difficulty but will stay asleep. Other exhausting babies neither want to go to sleep nor stay asleep. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  NIGHTTIME PARENTING LESSON #4:<br>  An important fact for you to remember is that your baby's sleep habits are more a reflection of your baby's temperament rather than your style of nighttime parenting. And keep in mind that other parents usually exaggerate how long their baby sleeps, as if this were a badge of good parenting, which it isn't. It's not your fault baby wakes up.<br>  <br>  8. Babies still wake up. When babies mature into these adult-like sleep patterns varies among babies. Yet, even though babies achieve this sleep maturity some time during the last half of the first year, many still wake up. The reason? Painful stimuli, such as colds and teething pain, become more frequent. Major developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, and walking, drive babies to "practice" their new developmental skills in their sleep. Then between one and two years of age, when baby begins to sleep through the above-mentioned wake-up stimuli, other causes of nightwaking occur, such as separation anxiety and nightmares.<br>  <br>  Even though you understand why babies are prone to nightwaking, you realize it's still important for parents and babies to get a restful night's sleep, otherwise, baby, the parents, and their relationship won't thrive. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0071381392.php?nid=170&isbn=0071381392" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0...</a><br>  In their efforts to encourage their baby to sleep better, one approach that many parents use is to put their baby to bed later in the evening. They think, “If he's 'really tired,' he'll sleep better, right?” Wrong! This often backfires because Baby becomes overtired and chronically sleep-deprived.<br>  <br>  In the majority of cases, a baby's biological clock is preset for an early bedtime. When parents work with that time, a baby falls asleep more easily and stays asleep more peacefully. Most babies are primed to go to sleep for the night as early as 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. I often hear about how babies and toddlers have a “meltdown” period at the end of the day, when they get fussy, whiny and out of sorts. I suspect that it's simply a sign of overtired children longing for sleep.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0071381392.php?nid=386&isbn=0071381392" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0...</a><br>  There are no good reasons for you to live as a sleep-deprived martyr. There are ways to get your baby to sleep without resorting to all-night cry-a-thons.<br>  <br>  In summary, I don't believe babies should be left alone to cry themselves to sleep. Or even left to cry as you pop in every 10 minutes to murmur comforting words without reaching out to touch him. But I also know that you can — gently and lovingly — help your baby to sleep peacefully all night long. So give The No-Cry Sleep Solution a try, and plan on seeing some wonderful sleep results.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T070300.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T070300...</a><br>  Get baby used to a variety of sleep associations.  The way an infant goes to sleep at night is the way she expects to go back to sleep when she awakens. So, if your infant is always rocked or nursed to sleep, she will expect to be rocked or nursed back to sleep. Sometimes nurse her off to sleep, sometimes rock her off to sleep, sometimes sing her off to sleep, and sometimes use tape recordings; and switch off with your spouse on putting her to bed. There are two schools of thought on the best way to put babies to sleep: the parent-soothing method and the self-soothing method. Both have advantages and possible disadvantages.<br>  <br>     1. Parent-soothing method. When baby is ready to sleep, a parent or other caregiver helps baby make a comfortable transition from being awake to falling asleep, usually by nursing, rocking, singing, or whatever comforting techniques work.<br>  <br>        Advantages:<br>            * Baby learns a healthy sleep attitude – that sleep is a pleasant state to enter and a secure state to remain in.<br>            * Creates fond memories about being parented to sleep.<br>            * Builds parent-infant trust <br>  <br>        So-called "Disadvantages": Because of the concept of sleep associations, baby learns to rely on an outside prop to get to sleep, so—as the theory goes—when baby awakens he will expect help to get back to sleep. This may exhaust the parents.<br>  <br>     2. Self-soothing method: Baby is put down awake and goes to sleep by himself. Parents offer intermittent comforting, but are not there when baby drifts off to sleep.<br>  <br>        So-called "Advantages": If baby learns to go to sleep by himself, he may be better able to put himself back to sleep without parental help, because he doesn't associate going to sleep with parents comforting. May be tough on baby, but eventually less exhausting for parents.<br>  <br>        Disadvantages:<br>            * Involves a few nights of let-baby-cry-it-out<br>            * Risks baby losing trust<br>            * Seldom works for high-need babies with persistent personalities<br>            * Overlooks medical reasons for nightwaking<br>            * Risks parents becoming less sensitive to baby's cries <br>  <br>  Remember, in working out your own parenting-to-sleep techniques and rituals, be sensitive to the nighttime needs of your individual baby and remember your ultimate goal: to create a healthy sleep attitude in your baby and to get all family members a restful night's sleep. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  #<br>  RANSITIONING TECHNIQUES<br>  <br>  Many infants need help making the transition from being awake to falling asleep, which is really a prolongation of the bedtime ritual that conditions baby that sleep is expected to soon follow.<br>  <br>  # Nursing down. Nestle next to your baby and breastfeed or bottlefeed him off to sleep. The smooth continuum from warm bath, to warm arms, to warm breast, to warm bed is a recipe for sleep to soon follow.<br>  <br>  # Fathering down. Place baby in the neck nestle position (nestle baby's head against the front of your neck with your chin against the top of baby's head. The vibration of the deeper male voice lulls baby to sleep) and rock your baby to sleep. If baby doesn't drift off to sleep while rocking, lie down with your baby, still in the neck nestle position, and let baby temporarily fall asleep draped over your chest. Once baby is asleep, ease the sleeping baby into his bed and sneak away.<br>  <br>  # Rocking or walking down. Try rocking baby to sleep in a bedside rocking chair, or walk with baby, patting her back and singing or praying.<br>  <br>  # Nestling down. For some babies, the standard fall-to-sleep techniques are not enough. Baby just doesn't want to be put down to sleep alone. After rocking or feeding baby to sleep in your arms, lie down with your sleeping baby next to you and nestle close to her until she is sound asleep. We call this the "teddy- bear snuggle."<br>  <br>  # Wearing down. Some babies are so revved up during the day that they have trouble winding down at night. Place your baby in a baby sling and wear her around the house for a half-hour or so before the designated bedtime. When she is fully asleep (see limp-limb sign) in the sling, ease her out of the sling onto her bed. For babies who are used to nursing off to sleep in a mother's arms, fathers can wear their baby down to sleep and give mother a break.<br>  <br>  Wearing down is particularly useful for the reluctant napper. When baby falls asleep in the sling, snuggled with his tummy against your chest or draped over your chest once you lie down, you both can take a much-needed nap.<br>  <br>  # Swinging down. Wind-up swings for winding down babies are a boon to parents who have neither the time, energy or creativity to muster up rituals of their own. Tired parents will pay anything for a good night's sleep. Once in a while a moving plastic seat may be more sleep inducing than a familiar pair of arms. Sometimes high-need babies associate a parent's body with play and stimulation and will not drift off to sleep in a human swing. For them the mechanical one is less stimulating, if not downright boring, and therefore can be a useful part of a sleep-ritual repertoire. Yet remember, high-need babies are notoriously resistant to mechanical mother substitutes and will usually protest anything less than the real mom. Before you actually spend money on a swing, you might want to borrow one for a week or two to see if the spell of the swing will last. You may discover that you are uncomfortable with mechanical mothering and decide to get more creative. Still, swings have their moments.<br>  <br>  # Driving down. If you've tried all the above transitioning techniques and baby still resists falling asleep, place baby in a carseat and drive around until she falls asleep. When you return home and baby is in a deep sleep, carry the carseat (with the sleeping baby) into your bedroom and let baby remain in the carseat until the first nightwaking. If she is in a deep sleep (witness the limp-limb sign – hands unclenched, arms dangling loosely at her side, facial muscles still), you may be able to ease her out of the carseat into her own bed.<br>  <br>  # Mechanical mothers. Gadgets to put and keep baby asleep are becoming big business. Tired parents pay high prices for a good night's sleep. It's all right to use these as|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	Oh yes, I went through this! My son will sometimes do it, although now he's content going to sleep if someone's just lying down in the room with him (I've fallen asleep many nights, way before he did, but he was calm and content having me in his room).<br>  <br>  I tried CIO once or twice, my son cried so bad that he threw up, and then I threw in the towel. I didn't quite feel right to me anyway... I don't think CIO is a good idea before a year, but that's just my opinion. There are many CIO methods you can try, including cry until he falls asleep, the 'stretch' method where you go in after 5 minutes to comfort him, then stretch the time to 10 minutes to go in before comforting him, stretching it to 15 and so on. You can also do the thing where you don't pick him up or make eye contact, but let him know mommy's in the room with him.<br>  <br>  The only thing I know that worked for me was a routine, and even then we still had nights where he'd wake up for hours at a time, raring to go! If my son didn't have dinner, bath, story, bottle, bed though it would take much longer to get him to sleep.<br>  <br>  Also, I made sure he wasn't over-tired when I put him down for the night (the more tired they are, the less they sleep) and that he had at least one good nap during the day. <br>  <br>  To tell you the truth, I think he just grew out of it... because I don't think I did anything to make it better. He started sleeping through the night at about 16 months (and he's 18 months old now, so I think I'm in heaven - lol).<br>  <br>  Don't cut out his naps, follow his clues as to when he's getting tired, make sure he's not over-stimulated when he goes to bed (that could really cause him to fight his sleep), dim the lights and sit with him in the room until he falls asleep. <br>  <br>  I know this is really hard. I gave up on rocking, because it didn't work... some nights I'd just let him run riot until he was so tired he couldn't see straight... lol. Probably not the right way to go about it - but finds what works for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

It's due to genetics. <br>  <br>  My husband has one brother, and I have one sister. Our babies are a complete toss up!<br>  <br>  But we have friends who have not had a boy in their family in 56 years...<br>  <br>  It's just genetics!|`|kycjmZbzaa	in my family it switches off. mom mom had two girls. dads moms parents had 3 girls, 1 boy. dads mom had 3 boys. my uncle, dads brother, has 3 boys and 1 girl, and my parents had 2 boys and a girl-me. also the boys are always the oldest.|`|OTiLeig8aa	Pretty much comes down to the man.<br>  <br>  If a man has more sperm with a Y chromosome, then they will have more boys.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Statistics show that if you have multiple kids all the same gender, the chance that your next one will also be the same gender is higher than for someone who has kids of different genders already.<br>  <br>  But it's a tiny effect - 1 or 2% at most. So yes, _some_ people have more of a chance of having a girl or boy - but even those people still have a strong chance of having the other one. 30 years is one generation. It's not a long time.<br>  <br>  In my family _everyone_ has one of each. One boy, one girl. But that has to be a statistical fluke, because there's simply no way the sperm which made my son could know I already had a daughter :)|`|vOomJtbsaa	I'm not sure how it works.  My hubby has 3 sisters and I have one brother and we wound up with a little boy.  I hope next time for a girl, that way we don't wind up having like 3 boys and one girl or vise versa.
USAqDvv2aa	congratulations hun! i can understand that (quite naturally) you are abit nervous!<br>  ask the docs all your questions and let him/her put your mind at rest!<br>  enjoy your pregnancy! <br>  p.s send some baby dust my way! lol! ****|`|tbLfz5FJaa	Hi my sister had an early m/c in Dec and fell straight away again in Jan....same boat. she had been ttc for 2 and a half years and was very anxious too. but so far so good she is now 11 weeks and has had a few scans to make sure baby fine etc. puts her mind at rest too maybe ask doc for 6 week scan so u can see heartbeat etc. Good Luck and fingers crossed the same will happen to u and have a successful pregnancy x x|`|rpq0TUaeaa	Congratulations!  I had a miscarriage in Feb at 6 weeks and I asked the doctor if it puts me at risk to have another miscarriage and he said no. Just thought it might ease your mind a bit.  It is completely normal to be anxious the next time.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	In order to know the chances of having the same experience as you had in Jan. you would have to know why you had the m/c then.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor why you lost the baby in Jan. Sweetie, I think it might be good for you guys to get some counseling. You are probably still grieving for your first pregnancy and don't even realize it.<br>  <br>  Your outcome would probably have more positive statistics if you waited a little longer and gained some strength. If perchance you don't carry this one, give yourself a break. Let your body and your heart heal. You have been through a lot|`|vrImLiv0aa	Just ask him your worries ans concerns, you may even want to write a little list as i tend to forget what i really needed to ask.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well for you hun x x|`|k0QRfQ00aa	First of all congratulations!! I think what you are feeling is very normal and I see a lot of question on YA of women afraid of losing their baby. Don't worry yourself girl! That is the main thing relax. I know it is easier said than done but it is less stressful on your baby if you are less stressed. Also, you should talk to your dr about your last m/c. No real questions to really ask them because once you give he/she your medical history they will tell you what's what and then according to their medical opinion you can discuss your next step. I wish you the very best and A very healthy and happy nine months!<br>  <br>  xx|`|pIBOSkfsaa	i wouldn't worry  a chemical miscarriage really has nothing to do with you or the condition of your uterus. Miscarriages mostly occur due to chromosonal defects in the fetus. Your body miscarry's because the fetus is irregular and will not allow it to implant into the uterus lining. Taking folic acid for 3 months prior to concieving will reduce the risk of an abnormal fetus.  Being pregnant now should be fine , If you do miscarry, it has nothing to do with the previous miscarriage, it is just nature. Good luck too you,  And congratulations
42vC5ztpaa	Its possible that you could be pregnant try taking a home pregnancy test if your over a week late on your period you should have enough HGC hormone in your urine to tell if your pregnant and look for some of these early pregnancy syptoms<br>    <br>  6. Increased sensitivity to odors<br>  If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you.<br>  <br>  5. Abdominal bloating<br>  Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small.<br>  <br>  4. Frequent urination<br>  Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.<br>  <br>  This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  3. A missed period<br>  If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period.<br>  <br>  2. Your basal body temperature stays high<br>  If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant.<br>  <br>  And finally...<br>  <br>  1. The proof: A positive home pregnancy test<br>  In spite of what you might read on the box, many home pregnancy tests are not sensitive enough to detect most pregnancies until about a week after a missed period. So if you decide to take one earlier than that and get a negative result, try again in a few days.<br>  <br>  If you're not keeping track of your menstrual cycle or if it varies widely from one month to the next, you may not be sure when to expect your period. But if you start to experience some of the symptoms below — not all women get them all — and you haven't had a period for a while, you may very well be pregnant. Take a home pregnancy test to find out for sure!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  10. Tender, swollen breasts<br>  One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  9. Fatigue<br>  Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.<br>  <br>  You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep.<br>  <br>  8. Implantation bleeding<br>  Some women have a small amount of vaginal bleeding around 11 or 12 days after conception (close to the time you might notice a missed period). The bleeding may be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of your uterus — a process that starts just six days after fertilization — but no one knows for sure.<br>  <br>  The bleeding is very light (appearing as red spotting or pink or reddish-brown staining) and lasts only a day or two. (Let your practitioner know if you notice any bleeding or spotting, particularly if it's accompanied by pain, since this can be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy.)<br>  <br>  7. Nausea or vomiting<br>  If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either — pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.<br>  <br>  About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up.|`|RGYbKzp2aa	I would wait 2 weeks before you take a test... It might have been implant bleeding.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	Sounds like implantation bleeding maybe.  Wait a week to let the hormones (if there are any) travel through your body, and take a test.  Good luck!|`|HTzVyeYyaa	I would get a test to see.  and then, make an appointment with your OB/GYN regardless of the results because if you aren't pregnant, it could be a sign of something being wrong.<br>  Good luck hun!
f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	well yes its always hard. I would come up with the perfect name and my husband wouldn't like it. We finally decide on three beautiful name!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	It was not that HARD FOR ME TO MAKE A LIST OF GIRLS AND BOYS BUT IT WILL BE HARD FOR ME TO NARROW THEM DOWN.|`|svOAkfWUaa	I picked my daughters name 2 weeks before she was born.  It was supposed to be Ashley but several other women named theirs Ashley and one day I was watching a music video and a singer named Shanice came on (1989) and I liked it plus it is simular to mine, so that was what we named her.<br>  <br>  Me and my husband had our son's name picked out before I got pregnant with him.<br>  <br>  So I guess it all depends.

cmNQJjEbaa	Maltese aren't toys and they are not for children! Maltese are also very delicate b/c they have fragile, tiny bones. I have read soooo many stories where children have accidently dropped a maltese and the poor dog suffered brain injures, broken bones and even death. Even a seven pound maltese will break if accidently dropped or stepped on! It's like having a dog with bones made of glass! If you want a toy than go to Toys R Us and buy one! Maltese can be nippy and don't tolerate children. If you think your daughter will be good around a maltese, just remeber, your daghter will have FRIENDS. <br>  Most maltese owners are graduates(from college) with no children or they are retired and they have grown-up children. Maltese are like babies, not dogs. I don't know of a good breeder that will sell a puppy to a family that has children under 15 years old. <br>  <br>  If you want a maltese that will live many healthy years buy it from a reputablte breeder, and maltese cost ALOT! I hope you're prepared  Maltese are veryyy expensive. If you want a healthy, pure bred maltese, the average price for a female puppy $2500+ and the average price for a male $1500+ Please buy from a reputable breeder. I've seen PET quality MALE puppies for $5000. Any cheaper any they are probably from puppymill or a backyard breeder that don't health screen any of their dogs. So do you want a healthy dog? Or do you want one that will die in a couple of years or even months? Or do you want one that you will pay close to $1000 on medication because it is sick or poorly bred? The smaller they are, the more problems they will have and the more they cost. ALL small dogs are indoor only dogs. Maltese should NEVER be outside alone for any time periods. If they are not food for other larger animals(even larger dogs), they can be stolen, b/c maltese puppies are really expensive. Maltese are also an expensive breed to own, grooming avr. $50 a month. Maltese are very high maintanence! You can get a cute puppy cut or you can leave their hair long. You will need to trim i because it is like human hair and just keeps growing and growing. If you leave their hair long, it is pain to groom daily and they can't wear clothes b/c then their hair will get knotted up. They need baths every week.  Maltese are hard to groom by yourself, trust me, I've been learning. Maltese do need sweaters and jackets because they have no undercoat like other dogs do so they get cold easily in the winter. But every dog is an individual, some dogs like clothes and some don't. I can tell you that the Maltese breed are not very high strung! <br>  I got my first maltese puppy from some breeder in OK(i live in VA, the pup was sent to me via airplane) so I never saw where the puppy was kept and I didn't really care b/c she was all I could afford. The puppy was already sick when we got her. My puppy died less than 3 months later, due to a parasite that kills the immune system and that only rodents carry! :( My parents payed for all the vet bills which costed twice as much as the puppy.) I later found out that my puppy was from a puppy mill :( I also learned that maltese are prone to many other genetic life-threatening defects. A reputable breeder will do health screenings on all their dogs and puppies! <br>  The next month we found a great breeder and drove over five hours to the breeder's house to get the new puppy. She had been breeding and showing maltese since the 70s so she was very knowlegdable of the breed! My new maltese, Gigi, was $2500 and she hasn't had one health problem so far(knock on wood lol) and I've had her for 6 months! Gigi was worth every penny! Please buy from a good breeder b/c health should be the most important thing your new puppy should have. Till this day, Gigi is the most expensive thing in our house(besides the cars of course). <br>  Maltese don't do well home alone for many hours. And Maltese puppies, under any circumstances, can not be left home alone at all for more than an hour! Because they are so tiny as puppy, they can suffer hypoglycephemia(low blood sugar) really fast. This is also with any small dogs that will be 7 pounds or under full grown. They should not be left home alone untill they are 5 months old or at least four pounds.<br>  Don't feed your puppy any food from the grocery store! It is bad for maltese. Heck, I don't even feed my maltese food from petsmart. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do DON'T BUY FROM A PET STORE OR PUPPYFINDER OR ONLINE CLASSIFIED LIKE CRAIGSLIST! They sell puppy mill puppies and those poor things probably won't live to see their first birthday! Puppyfinder does not care if you are a breeder or a puppy mill. <br>  <br>  Here's a list of reputable breeders by state from the American Maltese Association: <a href="http://www.americanmaltese.org/2009_AMA_Breeders_List.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanmaltese.org/2009_AMA_...</a><br>  If a breeder near you does not have a female pup available, many other breeders are willing to ship a puppy via airplane.I wouldn't suggest looking at any other breeders than the breederds on that list. <br>  <br>  Here's a great website to help you out! It's all about maltese! Become a member and ask this question! You will learn so much !<br>  <a href="http://spoiledmaltese.com/" rel="nofollow">http://spoiledmaltese.com/</a><br>  <br>  Please do your research on dog breeds. There are many other small dogs that cost less, easier to take care of and, more child friendly.|`|nKSmgjylaa	NO! A dog isn't a present or a toy to dress up.<br>  Buy the kid an easter egg, she's obv. not mature enough for a pet of her own. Don't be fcuking cruel, think of the animals.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think it's cruel to buy a child an animal just so she can dress it up and carry it around.  Pets are not dolls.|`|C0GeEv7kaa	I can tell you that the Maltese breed is very high strung and very high maintenance. I have a dog that is  half maltese and half shih tzu and he is so high strung that he entertains himself everyday. They need baths every  few days and they have to have their hair cut religiously because it's like human hair and just keeps growing and growing. They also have very small bladders so they go to the bathroom a lot. I stupidly got mine a couple months before I gave birth to my first child so my puppy is puppy pad trained which is really gross because there's poop and pee in my house. I would recommend a totally different breed. A medium sized breed.|`|pvKbsrzaaa	if your daughter wants something too dress up & carry around, then get her a dolll, not a dog.<br>  she needs to get off her high horse.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	No, I think it's a terrible idea.

Pets are not dolls.|`|nidCgr73aa	A dog or any animal isn't just for a gift or to play dress-up with.<br>  <br>  Where are your brains? <br>  <br>  At twelve she shouldn't be really grown-up but you should be trying to encourage her out of her "princess stage". She'll of probably started secondary school (UK) by now and you don't want her getting teased.<br>  <br>  If you think she could handle a dog then get her a dog but do not let her dress it up etc treat it as a normal dog they aren't play things.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|XagPxe7Faa	Dogs are living things that require attention and care.  They are not play things to dress up and carry around.  Perhaps you could get her a stuffed dog, or encourage her be more like Paris and Brittany in other ways....she could flash her friends, get wasted or you could get her a rhinestone encrusted Blackberry.|`|HFA05vDuaa	i honestly think that's a bad idea. if you want a family dog then go for it. but a) getting her a dog like that would make her really think shes a princess nad she can get whatever she wants and b) a dog is a real animal not a stuffed one, i don't think animals should be dressed up and used as an accessory|`|gP0gYbBaaa	thats horrible.<br>  its an animal. it deserves love and respect.<br>  its not a barbie doll for her to carry and dress up.<br>  if you dont know what supplies you need for a puppy u should be getting one in the next month.<br>  <br>  oh yea its not that 'glamorous and princessey' to have a puppy. they need to be potty trained and will poo and pee all over ur house.

AA11724307	the test from a few days ago is likely the evaporation line you are seeing.  You didnt miss a line and you should throw them out as they are invalid to even look at 10 minutes after you use them.  As for the other test...most people will tell you any line is a positive...but I dont see it that way.  there is a natural line there made up of the antibodies that turn the test positive and sometimes it can be visible when wet.  If you are truely pregnant you will test positive tomorrow or the day after or the day after that.  I would say you need to wait and test again.  good luck|`|wFe7L1XJaa	If you had 2 lines one was dark and the other was light your pregnant it could just be that the test was not sensitive enough to read your hormone level you could be very early in pregnancy still . you should go and get a clear blue digi that reads pregnant or not pregnant very clearly Good Luck and Congratulations!!!
7DWy8mPZaa	If anyone has the answer to this, I'd be really grateful too! I know just how hard it is waiting around. . . usually my more tense time waiting is to ovulate as I've had a history of irregular, long cycles until recently. The 2-week-wait is equally stressful! Honestly, I think it will always be at the back of your mind that the time to test is drawing close...there's just so much anticipation and "Am I?/ Aren't I?" in the air to completely take your mind off things! I've been through 7 2ww's so far and each time, it gets a little easier to bear personally in terms of getting to know what is 'normal' PMS for your body and when the alarm bells need to ring if things are feeling a little different!  Of course, going by symptoms alone is never advised, but it doesn't hurt to keep an eye on things.<br>  <br>  I busy myself with work usually. My long working hours just lately have completely over-ridden TTC anticipation! Other than that, trying out new recipes for cooking family meals, long country walks or even throwing yourself into crafting or a new hobby could help. I've taken up more reading whilst TTC than ever before! It never hurts to read the occassional baby/ pregnancy/ birth related book too once in a while, even this early! Yahoo answers is also a great way to vent and even find out new things, as I'm sure you're aware.<br>  <br>  Wishing you lots of positive energy and BFP-vibes for when you can test! ***|`|010e45dc0e6346ff817fa3cf9c7d3649aa	Hi hun, I am half way through my 2ww and i think i may have managed to convince myself of having mild nausea!!<br>  I have spent alot of time on here when my 11month old is asleep reading of other peoples experiences, it stops me from going mad!!  <br>  I wish i had a way of helping you to get through the 2ww without going mad but i'm afraid i don't!

CdJtH0xdaa	I think family therapy will be the best thing for you and your daughter. The therapist will help your daughter, but will also help you with discipline.|`|bxxwhP04aa	What state do you live in ?   Here in NYS we have what they call the PINS program.  I am not sure which agency runs it, but they send workers to talk with the child, and laws of the house are laid out to the child.  If the child does not cooperate with the parent, the PINS people will put the child in a dentention home until the child becomes compliant with her parents.  I would suggest you call for information from your mental health department, or from Catholic Charities, or even call a hospital and talk to a social worker.  You need help, mother, and sometimes these kids need force to begin to make sense out of their lives.|`|HiQOAgjoaa	it seems like this baby is straigtening her out. This baby just might be what she needs. what YOU need to do is help her quit doing these bad things, she wants it deep down, even if she doesnt act like it.

If you have a room in your house that doesn't have a window, make her stay there. You need to discipline her whether you want to or not. As long as she's living under your roof she should follow your rules. And if she's smoking on the way to school, drive her to school.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	I smell a troll...<br>  <br>  Edit: Look at their other questions..|`|AA11296427	OMG.<br>  <br>  It's spelled P R E G N A N T.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|rNvXWMOMaa	put her over your knee and spank her with your hairbrush|`|81hnBpOlaa	Listen Ma'am grounding her will just make her wanna do more bad things.

And if none of thoes work you could ship her to boarding school|`|e2NKXhoOaa	I am really sorry things like that happen, you just have to be straight up with her of the consequences of her having a baby, maybe having  her have a baby is a good thing.

You can only move forward. She is 14 and pregnant. I'm sure that she is scared! What she needs right now is your love and support. You need to sit down w/ her and TALK- heart to heart. She needs to understand that she will soon be a mother, herself. If she is smoking or doing drugs, of course, she needs to stop, because she is pregnant. As her parents, you should not have to "cover up" anything for her. She needs to be responsible for her own actions. She has engaged in "adult actions", now it's time to act like an adult. Remember, she is pregnant and I guess that should be everyone's primary focus, right now. It's too late to ground her or not let her leave the house. As hard as this must be, she just needs your love and support, no criticism or judging. That will only make the situation even worse. I will pray for all of you. Good Luck!|`|UmqLkwAraa	Well first off u need to stop and be the parent and stop trying to be her friend she dont want to listen call the damn cops on her *** shes going to over run u ur the adult she the child.

XOAsjuJraa	No, he cannot!<br>  <br>  PDA is against regulation. =]|`|IHHOHsMbaa	Sorry it is PDA, you can still do it, just don't get caught.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Whats a JROTC uniform?<br>  <br>  Why does it matter what he's wearing. He likes you and you clearly like him. I don't understand this question.<br>  <br>  Oh, Then just hold hands when he's not in uniform.|`|3eCTdQ08aa	nope, it's considered pda, which is forbidden in uniform.<br>  However- at my school, not many of the people in JROTC actually follow the no pda rule.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	Nope, it's concidered PDA and yes, he will get into trouble for it.
RdV8pEesaa	you may be preganat as sometimes when the egg is fertilized some blood is passed and it is much the same as a period the best way to find out is take the test tho and i hope it goes ok for you good luck
AA12033653	Talk to your son's pediatrician about this. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|f98093c5efc4ff7a072f987cac7a9d42aa	When I first started reading your question, I was thinking heat rash, especially under the arm, but when you got to the part where it turned brown and you busted it, I decided I have no clue. I would definitely talk to his doctor about it, especially the one that is tender and red. Put some triple antibiotic cream w/pain reliever on it. I hope you have a tube of that on hand, because it's wonderful!!! It's my go-to treatment for most minor injuries.

ZHGMLPhuaa	Ok!!!! Well I know a way it goes like this. . . You give it a drink as in bottle and maybe some apple sauce or something. you could give it a leake free bottle put it to bed and give it a bear or something. But remember every now and then to let it walk and play around or elles it will cry and well your right back were you were. but if it cry's don't worry it will do that sometimes. And when you take it out of bed or blanket and let him/her walk around so it won't get mad oh and don't forget to play with it a little.Well I know it sounds like alot of work but it's not it just a lot of writing!!!! HA!!! HA!!!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	you cant give out 29 points|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	1st you cant give 29 point<br>  second<br>  lay her over your lap your arms under her and shush her. put you mouth right on her head and shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... loudly.<br>  oh yah have her belly down<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddRkI5wVIqQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddRkI5wVI...</a>|`|wTeJulT5aa	A couple things that worked for me when my baby would cry for no real reason (actually she was tired, but not hungry or dirty diaper).  Turn on the faucet.  The sound of the water is soothing.  Also, my baby also will stop crying if you put her in front of the mirror.  She starts looking at herself and it calms her down.|`|A7cZtZFyaa	My daughter would always calm down if I pick her up and walk around with her.<br>  If that doesn't work, she get's the boob.<br>  <br>  Alright! Where's my 29 points!|`|GNLYxY7kaa	the very best way is a warm bath, they will stop fussing i promise. my son had colic BADDDD and nothing calmed him down except a very warm bath. he would take like 3 a day.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	how do u wanna give me 29 points???|`|i9aVklGVaa	While you can't change temperament / past life issues / birthing trauma issues / anger absorbed from parenting, a "spirited child" needs:<br>  - consistency of routine<br>  - any of the "Five S" in great doses--swaddling, sucking, shhing, swinging, singing<br>  - she might be over-stimulated or nervous around other children<br>  - she might be absorbing lots of negative energy from people around him; babies are VERY SENSITIVE to energy & thoughts. Surround her with loving kindness and mentally ask your/her spiritual helpers to intervene. <br>  - nothing like a nice bath!<br>  <br>  Good luck; it's hard to deal with.|`|hTR9whJnaa	First, calm your own thought.  That will signal to the baby that you are there to meet her needs.<br>  <br>  What is she telling you that she needs?  Love, love, love, always!  Hold her, nurture, reassure her --- meet her needs for security.  Keep her around you - she is probably very intelligent and needs freedom from boredom.<br>  <br>  Enjoy learning from her!|`|RLtzqQB9aa	cant get 29 points
4RjM5lElaa	Been there done that.  I actually brought a diaper with the questionable poop in it to the doctor (gotta love my pediatrician!)<br>  <br>  All was fine - just digestion changes and teething.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA12033653	Yes you are safe to fly until late in your 3rd trimester.  UNLESS your doctor said otherwise or you are having a high risk pregnancy then check with your doctor first.|`|gjVeJFRtaa	my doctor said anytime you can fly but after 32 weeks dont|`|rjVALevtaa	Most doctors recommend that you do not fly during your last month of pregnancy but other than it's fine. If you can, try to limit your flying time to under 3 hours at a time. Because of the high altitude levels you are getting less oxygen and therefore your baby is too.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes, it is okay to fly.  Up to 32 weeks or so.<br>  <br>  Since you are a flight attendant and you fly a lot, talk to your doctor about it.|`|LoLwBDnIaa	yes it's ok to fly when pregnant till your about 32 weeks.<br>  <br>  My mum flew on a plane when she was about 5 weeks and she had a perfect baby girl, with no complications.<br>  <br>  hope that helped.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I heard it's ok up to 36 weeks|`|xfxlpT2Waa	yes i would think that you would be fine to fly but the best thing to do is to get a check up and ask your doctor what he or she thinks you should do. hopefully all is well with your pregnancy! congrats|`|cmK9Go1gaa	Its ok to fly but after about 30 weeks u can't|`|ZumZyPIJaa	yeah the best is to talk to ur doc about it

Ezkn5azdaa	I am trying to get one for myself and my three children. I am also a stay home mom but not doing daycare. I have a 7 year old and a 4 year old boy. And have a three month old baby girl. My baby girl needs to eat every three hours. And she naps when she wants too for now anyways. <br>  6:00 get up and feed the baby<br>  6:30 Get the boys up. The baby might be sleeping might not or haven't got the bottle yet has well.<br>  The boys breakfast then after breakfast they get dressed.<br>  8:00 My 4 year old get his coat on and his book bag. Then he ready for his bus to pick up for preschool he goes tuesday to friday.<br>  He gone by 8:15<br>  8:15 My 7 year old get coat on and book bag then his ride comes by 8:30 or so.<br>  After that it can be anything that needs to be done. baby feed and dishes and getting formula made if there hardly none for the day.<br>  11:45 my 4 year old gets drop of by the bus.<br>  12:00 lunch for both of us.<br>  After lunch he gets free time and I try to do want needs to be done and I do take breaks at times. The baby be feed and sleeping.<br>  4:20 my 7 year old gets drop off. And he gets free time and I am hoping to get supper going. <br>  5-6 it can be supper time and then put food away/<br>  6:00 baby feed or try to. Then do the dishes that been used for the day and same for the bottles.<br>  6:30 both boys start getting ready for bed. Bath Pajamas on and quiet time. <br>  7:30 pick up toys and read book.<br>  8 my 4 year old goes to bed<br>  8-9 My 7 year old do homework if he has any and he play quieting.<br>  9 he goes to bed<br>  Then if there none prepared formula then I be making formula for night feeding if I can get myself out of bed.<br>  10-11 Be bath for myself if the baby is sleeping. The baby would be gettign ready for bed and last feeding. Then both of us go to bed.<br>  It different. There times I have to go to appointments and some of them are an hour drive. This want the baby doctor wants on a feeding schedule to dot weight issue that ened up admitted to the hospital two times for<br>  2 am 5 am 8 am 11 am 2 pm 5 pm 8 pm 11 pm. But it never been that day. It been different each day. I feed her when she hungry but I don't let her go past three hours.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	To answer you question correctly I need to know a few things first because everyone needs different schedules for their specific situation.<br>  1. How old are the kids in your daycare?<br>  2. From what time to what time do you have the other kids?<br>  3. Do they all take naps and what time?<br>  4. Do all the kids come at the same time or do the parents drop them off at different times?<br>  5. What time do you and your son get up and go to bed?<br>  If you answer these questions for me I will try my best to help you.
DFaMY7Aaaa	Ooo the cheeks!<br>  What a beautiful baby;) Love the name.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Yes, yes, and yes! Too cute(:|`|f3SyOyMEaa	She's precious, and yes...I think the name fits.|`|BQXg09m9aa	Yes, it does. Especially, if she is a redhead! A redhead would fit just perfect with that name! She's adorable!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Yes.I think it is a very nice name.anyways as long as you like it then its fine.Shes so cute by the way.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I love how it looks like she is flipping you off|`|qT8yID3Taa	awww, she's adorable. yes i think it's a very cute name for her!|`|US6CnMR1aa	I think the name fits. When she get older I think she'll like it too. Aww your baby is so precious! I love it how she's so cubby, I also love that outfit you gave her. My mother's about to have a baby, boy and we're deciding to name him Alexander.<br>  :D shelb|`|gP0gYbBaaa	beautiful name for a beautiful girl|`|FliqRZIFaa	me and my friend think she is adorable. haha if you live in florida email me if you need a baby sitter:D and yeah that name fits her great!|`|g52eSE06aa	Yes she does look like an Ava Mae and she is so sweet x|`|GwiDPFygaa	I love it!!  By the way, she is SOOOO cute!!!!!!
dW9C6aswaa	Well I was induced with my son with cervidil It didn't work for me not saying it wont work for you.I was 2 centimeters and 50% effaced at my last appointment.I didn't dilate anymore and was put on Pitocin to help with my contractions. The pain on the pitocin is awful I gave birth 2 times my son was with pitocin  and my daughter with nothing all natural and I would do it all over again <br>  <br>  <br>  My labor from start to finish was  4 1/2 hours with my son
zVdVGsoJaa	I have heard that First Response is good.  Go to www.peeonastick.com - They have useful info on practically every brand you can think of.  Good luck, and ***BABY DUST***|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	I tested a couple days before I expected my period.   I used the Answer brand from Walmart and got accurate and fast results.  Do not use the Equate brand.  I used 2 different tests from 2 different boxes and got invalid results after I knew for sure I was pregnant.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Every test looks for the same thing: hcg pregnancy hormone - they're all the same but supposedly EPT can test a little earlier (first day late). <br>  <br>  Yes, I've used EPT as well as others and so have women close to me. No one has ever complained to me regarding any of them. <br>  <br>  I waited until I was close to a week late before testing just to be sure that I wasn't just late but I also didn't want to wait to long because of the need for prenatal care.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OhYE3GhKaa	my babies are 18 year old triplets. that was a long time ago that I did the pg. test. ept has been around that long, though ept stands for early pregnancy detection and it was one of the first tests.<br>  <br>  to be honest with you, i have seen tests in the dollar store and I have no idea if they are accurate or not. I think you get more false negatives, like the test saying you are not pg when you are, than false positives because they measure human chorionic gonadatropin (sic)<br>  <br>  You have to have a certain amount (HCG) to register a positive, which takes a certain number of days<br>  <br>  so you can be preg. and still have a negative result. Wait a few days at least after you miss your period. I know how hard it is to wait. YOU WANT TO KNOW<br>  <br>  Hope that you have a wonderful little boy or girl with no problems|`|vrImLiv0aa	I normally do before my period is due, an always use the first response tests. They seem great and fast results for me. Good luck hun! x
OdGHnebPaa	Heck yeah!<br>  Let her go for it!<br>  Don't encourage her to be super tough but enough to get the point across.<br>  If this was anyone other than her brother she would've done it long ago & guarenteed that guy woulda got the point.<br>  What your doing isn't currently working. He obviously isn't fazed by the loss of priviledges (as most 13yrs olds aren't) & he isn't responding to simply being told so he needs to be shown exactly how much he's hurting her.<br>  Make it clear to your daughter that this situation is a one time only kinda deal & she isn't allowed to retalliate with, & I'm using this word for lack of a better term although I don't feel it is, violence on a regular basis.<br>  It's NOT cute behavior & it needs to be stopped now.<br>  Once again, how would you want her to deal with it if it were a boy in her class? If she kicked him in school it would be considered self defense. She obviously cares about him & doesn't genuinely want to hurt him but just give him a taste of his own medicine & I say let her.|`|8dpZpH0Saa	What! No, you dont let her kick your son there. Fighting fire with fire dosent work! You tell her that she needs to ignore him and walk away and tell you immediately so you can take privileges away. He is not going to learn by her kicking him. And...if she does kick him, he might become angry and start a fight. Just punish him a different way.|`|Mjni0Np3aa	I can't believe that I'm saying this, but let her do it. This may be the only way for him to realize what it feels like to her. And you should be there so things don't get too carried away.|`|32d69300213c54018bab3031b85b4dc1aa	I would say let your daughter kick him so hard to give him a taste of his own medicine|`|RdeoVdlIaa	ok, awkward!! tell your son that it's rude and distgusting for him to do that to his sister!!  tell him its weird for him to be touching his older sister. also, ask him why he does it.|`|Z9xwKUt4aa	yeah, i think it would be okay just this once.  he needs to know that it's not okay and that there is pain involved.|`|lTsPX04jaa	oh just let them do what they want. they are children
