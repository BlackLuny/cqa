50It9DL5aa	well, when you say duck, you go to the next person, when you say goose, the person chases you. lol. hehhehehehehehe!!!|`|u8slDDkLaa	both birds belong to the family Anatidae<br>  <br>  The goose (male--gander) is a medium to large bird and makes a honking call. ("True geese" belong to the subfamily Anserinae.) Non-domesticated geese are very migratory, flying from far north to far south. Geese eat a vegetarian diet.<br>  <br>  The duck (male--drake) is smaller than the goose and the female often has a call more similar to "quack". (Contrary to popular belief, it does echo.) Ducks belong to several different subfamilies. Almost all domesticated ducks (excluding some in Central America) are descended from the Mallard, so they have very similar forms. Some duck species don't migrate, and some moult before migration, temporarily rendering them flightless. Many ducks eat fish, amphibians, and insects.|`|u6ctZCs8aa	Duck:<a href="http://sherriesjournalthoughtsofacomplexmind.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/duckling01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://sherriesjournalthoughtsofacomplex...</a><br>  <br>  Goose:<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2708883514_c2fee7e82c.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2708...</a><br>  <br>  Thats the difference. =]

F1iNEWN4aa	There are special cleaning solutions for your brushes, although there are a few other things that will clean them just as well: baby shampoo, liquid handsoap, or even your facial cleanser. I use my Neutrogena stuff to clean my brushes and it works great, my sephora brushes have last months without having any bristles fall out.|`|6a87cb1c2041684b43ca4ca52edacbd3aa	They have brush cleaner that you can use but I just wash my brushes with lukewarm water and baby shampoo.  Then I reshape them and lay them flat to dry.  That's what works best for me.|`|Eis0wGU2aa	theres a spry from colorscience thats a brush cleaner

VLO7e4tMaa	1. No    2. A little dry with occasional outbreaks on chin & forehead   3. It made it kinda scaly   4. NO!  Too expensive, and they keep sending it to you, even if you ask them to stop.  It's kind of like a 'club', and they send it on a regular basis.    <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, the thing that worked best was applying a mixture of olive oil and table salt after cleaning.  The salt acts like a scrub to clean out pores.  Leave it on at least 30 minutes.  Made my skin clear and soft.  Only every now and then I will get a spot or two, which is no big deal!  Put a dab of Milk of Magnesia on those, and let it dry.  That will dry them up!  Cheap and easy!|`|TrTfowAQaa	NO proactive did not work for me. it made my skin worse! I have sensitive oily skin... so I made my own cure for my skin break outs. tea tree oil soap with pure tea tree oil on a wet cotton ball and rubbed it all over my face... let air dry then used tea tree oil skin soothing gel by JASON's... all this stuff is natural products from the organic hippy section on really dry days I used pure vitamin e oil to ease the really dry spots...after my skin started to heal from the break outs I cut back on the treatment... I didn't break out again til I got pregnant... so I know it sounds CRAZY that oily skin became clear after an oil,oil,oil, & more oil treatment.... HOWEVER tee trea oil kills microbodies... fungus and bacteria and viruses so skin break outs are usually bacteria related and it really does work|`|Fobf8q2haa	It did work for me, it cleared my face in about a week & I did have less breakouts. I have dry skin & it didn't damage my face, although sometimes it got a tad drier than the usual. It is worth your money, IMO, but Proactiv doesn't work for everyone. My cousin used it, and her results were way less noticeable than mine.|`|aXtV5YdFaa	I have only been using it for a week. My skin is normally oily, but is less oily (in a good way) now that I have been using it. No damage. I can't say if it is useless or not 'cause it's only been a week.|`|PQzrsXsKaa	It did not work for me. I have normal skin, I guess. It stung a little, but no damage was done. I don't think it would be worth your money.|`|aCDghBOGaa	ive been wonderin  that too is nutrogena better or proactive answer ppl!!!|`|xv3opX9Maa	no it just made my skin dry and flaky <br>  it kinda helped some of the big red pimples but it didnt do anything for blackheads or whiteheads or anything else <br>  and its def not worth it <br>  ( =

NuPwR75Jaa	Babydoll dresses are lovely on everyone. And sometimes you can buy padded babydoll dresses so they make your boobs look bigger. You shouldn't let your chest annoy you, some guys prefer girls with a smaller chest believe it or not.  Good Luck. (:|`|i9ST2JBwaa	Wear a wonderbra or something.. I don't know..I don't have your problem, thankfully.|`|R94PIATQaa	Go to the JUNIOR/KIDS section of any department store and I bet they will have something that fists you :)<br>  <br>  You could also try wearing a waterbra or a padded bra-this will give the illusion that you have bigger breasts.<br>  <br>  When I was going through puberty and I was flat, I wore hoodies and/or sweaters that are not snug-fitting. This way, people won't have to see my flatness.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, this small chest problem is (excuse the pun)-a small issue. When you hit puberty, BOOM, you grow like crazy :D<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|MoUtk7cUaa	my sister was teased even more for using padding ( idon't really know if she was, but the teasing was just as bad either way), i wouldn't advise that. and when i was a kid, just as now, i couldn't care less about the size of your chest, i'd rather know that your breasts aren't gonna end up around your knees by the time you're 30. you will continue to 'grow' until around 23, it's hard but try to be patient and tolerant of fools.  as for finding a dress, you may have to learn to sew until you grow.  best wishes.|`|pYpXj7gOaa	Well how old are you?<br>  if you're below the age of 14 you really shouldent worry about that.<br>  and you can buy bras with extra padding in them, it makes your chest look bigger and its also way more comfortable.<br>  hope i helped (:|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	Padded bras,  wear any padded bra with the little padding pocket inside the cup - this way you can put extra gel pads inside|`|QkIJEG1Gaa	get some large bread rolls called pandesal, and it will fill your cup to a size d, LOL|`|cyt7oh97aa	I have the same problem.  It's just easier to wear padded bras.  It helps me fit into all my clothes.  My favorite are Victoria Secret.  If you go there they will help you find the perfect size.  I'm 21 and still wear 32 A's and I'm sure I could still wear AA's if I wanted.  <br>  The teasing goes away when you stop caring about it.  I noticed the teasing went away a lot more when I got padded bras.  <br>  The only bad thing is that guys will think you're bigger than you are, but if they're shallow enough care only about your breasts then screw them.  My boyfriend loves mine, they're always perky.  =]

AA10303022	a home remedy that is recommended to all our customers is to use equal parts of baking soda and warm water to make a paste.  then take the paste and rub all over your jewelry then rinse with water and dry off with a soft cloth.  <br>  <br>  you can go to the TCO store and ask for a polishing cloth (which is the same cloths we use to polish our jewelry).  if you have scratches on it, there is nothing you can do about it - you'll have to take it into the store and have them polish and buff it out for you - depending on if it's a necklace, bracelet or ring, the prices will vary.<br>  <br>  advice is: the more you wear your silver TCO jewelry, the less likely it will begin to tarnish - because you are not wearing it, the jewelry is being oxidized causing air to collect on it, therefore causing it to tarnish.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|0Wf3Au4kaa	Tiffany and Co. uses the same kind of silver every other jewelry brand does so I don't think it would hurt to use a regular silver jewelry cleaner from a drugstore.|`|boFJFWrNaa	well, i clean all my Tiffany & Co. jewelry with toothpaste haha. I use an old toothbrush and carefully clean it<br>  But if you dont want to do this, i think you should take it to the store to get it clean, and they can do it even better<br>  But you can also use normal silver cleaner as well, it will work the same|`|h1OCYD7Gaa	You can take it to the store and they will charge you 10.00 to clean it.  Alternatively you can purchase the offical tiffany and Co cleaning set for around 30.00.

Also use this eyeshadow on the inner corner of your eyes. Use peachey tones below the eye bone, blending to the outer corners. on/ just below the eye bone, highlight with a brown, or darker color than the previous peach for depth. Use a little of this color on your bottom lash line for a somewhat smokey eye. Add brown or hazel eyeliner for green eyes to really bring out the color!|`|f4df9712869843dd814c1e02d77242eaaa	for a natural look it's best to use neutral colors...use your eyeliner on the roots of your upper eyelashes and apply one to two coats of mascara.  pink eye shadow or a more neutral color will be good. also, you really don't need any eyeliner on the lower lid...just run a single coat on the lower lashes.  at night, you can use some more funky looking eyeshadows and eyeliners, but during the day its best to keep it looking subtle...  less is more.  also, i use a blush illuminator.  it gives you a subtle hint of color and gives your skin a soft glow.   put some on the apples of your cheeks and on the cheek bones|`|0dbASWe5aa	Shades of brown, purple, and gold will make your green eyes stand out.  If you apply them lightly over a base that is close to your skin color, it will look more natural.<br>  <br>  As for eyeliner, I LOVE Maybelline's Lineworks waterproof liquid liner.

It did work really well but it was expensive (close to $10) so I haven't bought any since.

SNCeFeY1aa	well first off i think you're really pretty so you shouldn't worry about what ppl say about "ginger" and all that. i think you could look good as a blonde, but just dont go too light of a blond. or maybe just get subtle blonde highlights, so that it changes your hair, but doens't go to dramatic. remember if you do end up dying it to a darker color it will probably never come back to your natural light red copper.just keep that in mind.<br>  also, its kinda hard to tell but i think you have blue eyes right? if so, use browns and corals to make your eyes pop. purple is pretty good too, if you want a dramatic look for a party or something. <br>  good luck:]|`|JCGckRu6aa	Fellow ginger here.<br>  I hate the terms too. I get called it multiple times a day, and it gets me down. I completely understand how you feel.<br>  But, despite all the name calling, i really like my hair colour.<br>  The thing is with ginger hair is that for every person that is immature and hates it, another one loves it and would die for that colour. <br>  Anyway, if you wanna dye it blonde, do it for you, not because you feel anyone will like you better because of it. <br>  I still think natural is the way to go though, and one day, you will meet a guy what thinks your hair colour is the best thing about your appearence. <br>  And, you are not ugly, you are pretty, and i think that ginger suits you.<br>  But, i am biased :P|`|Pgxxru3xaa	you know what i'd do, right.<br>  i'm naturally blonde, but my hairs loads of colours atm.<br>  and i was gonna dye my hair white and finish off my edgy cut,<br>  but all i wanna do now.<br>  is dye it FIRE RED<br>  like really red.<br>  like haley williams in the decode video.<br>  <br>  amazing, try that (:|`|AA11957676	i think that you should totally go blonde! it would be a fresh, new look and it will also look natural because of your blonde eyelashes, and you'd look really pretty<br>  <br>  xoxo?<br>  blair|`|w5l7De7Daa	dont be blonde!<br>  <br>  go brunette. <3|`|ufTjv25Jaa	I reckon you'd look good blonde, but don't die your hair.

3PyRN1U9aa	i would relax. no concealer or foundation, go natural. put on brown eyeshadow, mascara, lip gloss, an apple blush. smile!|`|7DJkwzKDaa	LOL xD|`|es3feuhxaa	wear brown eyeliner,mascara, a light shimmery eyeshadow and a tiny amount of blush.<br>  :)|`|3FLQCDRFaa	i have pale skin, blue eyes and freckels too. my beauty advisor says that girlse with blue eyes look good with a dark blue eyeliner on the top lid only. for the bottom a soft gray/ silver would look good. since you have pale skin bronzer would be a mistake. take a powder or liquid foundation and blend it on all over your face. for color add a blush on top. for eyeshadow have 3 shades of brown ready. a dark brown a lighter brown and a soft tan brown. smear the darkest just below the crease. then with the next darkest shade put a thin line just above the crease. then with the lightest shade apply it right under your eyebrows until it meets the 2nd darkest shade. finish it off with mascara on your top and bottom lashes. it will look fun, natural and flirty.<br>  <br>  ( if you could answer mine that would be great!)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjRtdc2ken_oWFWU3WKDjjHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090303173826AArWxyr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  thankyou!!!|`|HLzegoKNaa	I wuold recommend a neutral gold-ish shimmery eyshadow.<br>  My fave eyshadow right now would have to be...<br>  <a href="http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/default.aspx#page=top{nav|media:_blank|overlay:productdetail//objectid+Cos18q_4//|diagnostic|main:beautyfilter//category+F1_Cosmetics_Eyes_Eyeshadow//|userdata//d+d//}" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/de...</a><br>  You can use the gold all over your eyelid with the brown lightly in your crease.<br>  If you don't normally wear eyshadows you will need a base, such as loreal's De Crease<br>  <a href="http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/default.aspx#page=top{nav|media:_blank|overlay:productdetail//objectid+Cos9_1//|diagnostic|main:beautyfilter//category+F1_Cosmetics_Eyes_Eyeshadow//|userdata//d+d//}" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/de...</a><br>  You simply dab a little on your eyelid and blend it all the way up from your lashes to your brow before you apply your eyeshadow. It helps it last all day.<br>  Also, I recommend a black-brown eyeliner such as revlon's colorstay.<br>  If you decide to use a blush I would recommend that you keep it warmer toned instead of pink-y.<br>  Since I am already on the loreal website, how about a color like this?<br>  <a href="http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/default.aspx#page=top{nav|media:_blank|overlay:productdetail//objectid+Cos3c_4//|diagnostic:_blank|main:beautyfilter//category+F1_Cosmetics_Face_Blush//|userdata//d+d//}" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/de...</a><br>  Just lightly on the apples of your cheeks.<br>  You don't have to ever match your makeup to your clothes so donn't even worry about what your wearing.<br>  Just keep it neutral. I would also invest in some makeup brushes. My fave brands are ecotools and Sonia Kashuk, both can be found in sets of 5 or 6 brushes at target for like 10 bucks. They are really great and soft and fantastic!|`|UuSmemr7aa	Just wear mascara and bronzer.

mViWr60Aaa	They would all look great on your body, but I think 4 & 5 are kind of unique looking. Though, I don't know how you would swim comfortably in #4's top.|`|32c5a26e00e77bac07f6445e8dafc461aa	I really liked 1,2, and 4, I think 4 would look really cute on you.|`|cLAx2WH6aa	i liked 6 but try this first:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myhaircuts.com/longhairstyle/asian-girl-hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhaircuts.com/longhairstyle/...</a><br>  <br>  and that color|`|ygsXippfaa	I think number two because of the cut and the color. It would look really cute.|`|hw3jNGubaa	all of them are cute but the number one winner would have to be 4!|`|7h9zvBfFaa	well i like all of them and think you will look stunning in all of them, but my top choices are 4, 5, and 6... i picked these choices because of your skin tone and your boob size... you don't have huge boobs, nor little ones so you really need a bathing suit that will fit you... the style of the first two will look really good, but your boobs need to be the perfect size for them... if they are too big, it wont work and curl up.. if they are to little it wont fit and slip... (don't worry it's not just you... out of 100 about 5 people have the perfect size boobs;) i picked number four because of the elastics around the chest area... having that it will securely hold your boobs if they are too small.. and if they are too big it will stretch to fit them:) i picked number five because it is a cute sexy one piece that will look stunning with your tone of skin!! and number six i picked because not only does it has an amazing contrast to its pattern, it has  secure straps that will hold your boobs!!! <br>  <br>  thx for taking the time to read this answer i hope it helped!! good luck!|`|6jaulL6maa	I like 2 or 6.  4 look like the top may come down easily and 5 looks like a nightie.

It's absolutely adorable!!|`|b3GZB3Wyaa	I really like #1 and #6 :)<br>  <br>  I think the style of number one would be most flattering on your body shape.<br>  <br>  x
hVMQvlYAaa	Maybelline Loose powder foundation is amazing. I'm a teenager and I use it and it makes your skin look perfect. It's so gentle, too. I can sleep in it if necessary. <br>  <br>  It's avalible at Target and drugstores for about 9-13 dollars deopending on where you are, but save the reciept because getting the color right is tricky!<br>  <br>  Also, don't reapply too much throughout the day. Looks cakey if you use a lot. Get oil-blotting shhets (4$) with it.<br>  <br>  =)|`|yIRcd5X8aa	You should get a mineral powder foundation, baremineral is awesome! But if you want something inexpensive and purchasable at target, Maybelline's Minerl Lose powder foundation is wonderful! and its safe for your skin|`|R13DPv8vaa	I love bare minerals!  But it is expensive.  you can get the starter pack for $60.  But I do understand that is expensive.  If you have an Ulta around you they make mineral make-up.  It's not as good as the bare minerals, but it's pretty good.  They starter pack is $25 and it come with the minerals foundation, finishing powder, blush, and the kabuki brush.<br>  <br>  If you don't have an Ulta around you.  Check the website.<br>  Hope you find one that works for you!!!|`|nHDMhJ92aa	I'm not sure if it's available at Target or not, but I know that Walgreens carries it. The brand is Jane-it's really good. Also Maybelline, Covergirl, and Rimmel all have mineral powder foundations that aren't very expensive and they work well also. Mineral powder foundations won't cause breakouts either. They don't have all the gunk in it that liquids have and are more natural.

7Wg8QdKeaa	I've never done that, even when I had no breasts. I think it's kind of ridiculous. What's wrong with small breasts? Really, don't worry much about it. They might grow. I had a small A cup until I was 17, and then they grew to a big C/small D. That might happen to you?|`|eluLMSAraa	I've seen this done on Dr.90210: this girl who was bascalliy flat like she looked like 4th grader who just hit puberty and she was getting a breast augmentation and the plastic surgeon was baffled because he thought her boobs were small but when she met him for a consultation her boobs were a pretty adequate size. But then she explain to him that she wore an a cup bra and then a wonder bra or pushup bra 1-2 sizes larger over her a cup bra. And he even said himself that that was very clever.

For the past 2 weeks, I have been forcing myself to not wear socks (or shoes) in my room just before I get ready for bed.  I'm trying to make myself comfortable about going barefooted in my room at home when my family is here.  I hope to soon be able to go barefoot around my family.  I haven't been able to do this since I was very little, probably before kindergarten.  So yes, I would say I am forcing myself to not wear socks.  I like to say that I'm forcing myself to go barefooted.  I've been able to go barefooted up to 3 hours!

6MgjXkWvaa	I use to suffer from the same problem and it is really annoying, people use to ask me for id before they would let me in places and when they saw that I was ok for entry they use to say stupid things like "but you look so young for your age" or "it must be nice looking so young"  In the end I use to put on a bit more make up round my eyes and wear really high heels, wear my hair up instead of leaving it long and hanging down! These things actually worked and it was great to have a life without people questioning my age.<br>  Please do not start smoking to make yourself look older, as suggested in one of your replies - it would be a really stupid thing to do and would not solve your problem but cause you health issues.<br>  With regards to having less sleep this would not really make you look any older but make you feel really tired and then you would not be able to enjoy yourself because you would be feeling tired and unattractive with the bags under your eyes.<br>  Hope some of my suggestions work,<br>  good luck.|`|6dquMxgmaa	Wear lots of make-up;<br>  Black eye pencil,<br>  Blusher, <br>  Eye shadow,<br>  Mascara,<br>  Powder not too dark<br>  & a very nice;<br>  lipstick: pink-ish with gloss on the top.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped  xD  And hope you find your-self a job.|`|ce1cd1ce55b68d3025b9888a8f58c391aa	Boob job<br>  tons of makeup<br>  revealing clothes|`|bc672f6eb9191dfc00d1b8146c3ccbbfaa	get a life ..it dont matter...<br>  <br>  its what makes us diffrent..|`|VdjmrwMZaa	ya black hair would help alright...<br>  so would eyeliner|`|ljy6jKupaa	smoking's meant to age the skin... you could start smoking|`|xUCXXb73aa	be patient,the job market is in the tank,btw enjoy your youth|`|XPaLYdobaa	40 cigarettes a day and 10 pints of lager|`|s5Tg2M4paa	get less sleep like 2 hrs to 4hrs each night.|`|EByXhqRQaa	wear a lot of makeup, maybe?<br>  I don't really know, sorry >__<

JU99pAC6aa	I'm not quite pear shaped, but I am quite curvy so I can't wear skinny jeans either. <br>  <br>  Boot-cut jeans work great for me, and also for my super curvy best friend. <br>  <br>  I buy mine at the GAP, they carry Curvy, Long and Lean, and I believe one other style. The Curvy bootcuts are fantastic. I'm also 5'9 and they come long enough so even I can wear heels with them!<br>  <br>  Good luck! It's always hard to find jeans if you're not a stick-figure. :( But rejoice in your curves... real women have them.|`|29FPxp9jaa	if you're "pear-shaped"  DO NOT wear jeans that are tight at the legs 'cos it will make you look fat.Wear straight-cut or boot-cut jeans.They make your legs look shapely.<br>  <br>  : )
JN6LWA6Oaa	No, it's not bat at all, it's who you are. Just be friendly with people and they'll love you, but don't feel bad or change or anything, you are really cool and just stick with that. Oh, and I love red hair, never met a girl with it though :( lol Good luck, and we really miss your questions haha|`|8e4fc719086a20ed4db62bae7f7a4446aa	No it isn't bad, you are who you are. You should never try to change yourself just to blend in with other people, Keep being who you are and wearing what you like, if others have a problem with it then that's their issue. Good luck and don't worry about it!|`|4aGoWKtEaa	They probably think your accent is cool. Most americans like british accents. Don't worry about it's kind of a good thing.|`|V2F8YCa2aa	No! It's cool that you are different. People won't think that it's weird that you're from some where else.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	I love english accents :)<br>  <br>  No its alright :D|`|xUCXXb73aa	welcome to the US give it time you'll fit in|`|WGFtXo6Paa	I'm also an immigrant, so I see where you're coming from. Really, at first I was worried too, but have you noticed that America has every type of person? So, if you feel like you stand out, remember, really no one pays attention because they've seen about every single thing possibly worth seeing. and I think it's pretty cool. for example, at school, the girls that were the most outrageous, off-the-runway clothes and short bobs are the ones I always compliment because they are different.|`|cSrxQHIhaa	ok, first off i am totally jealous of you moving to America. I ENVY that. I love America you see and I live in Scotland .. sigh, moving during Uni !<br>  <br>  anyways swiftly moving on ..<br>  it's only a bad thing if you don't like the attention. If people are making friends with you and stuff because you seem alien to them i guess it's not that bad! it's individual and you should keep that, dont try and blend in because you have to keep your Englishnesnes alive x]<br>  but on the other hand, if you don't like it you could just try and go with the style over there and dye your hair as you will most likely soon aquire a wee tan :]<br>  xxxxxx<br>  <br>  p.s jealous.|`|M6cUq54Naa	No, you should never consider it bad to stand out. Heck, standing out is my favorite hobby. You should never change yourself to satisfy anybody else. While I know that's what everyone says, it's true. It won't feel right if you start dressing and acting differently than you normally would. <br>  <br>  Besides, English accents are friggin cool.|`|ZzRZTgmxaa	Its not bad that you stand out In fact, I think that from what you've described yourself as looking like, that you have individuality, and don't ever lose that.|`|QUIZ9Fqxaa	No, its great that you are individual. Stay true to your roots. Especially in highschool its hard for girls to be individual and stand out.|`|ABcTndrCaa	not at all, be yourself girl. You don't want to look like a cookie cutter like a bunch of girls in high school do. Welcome to America and I hope you're enjoying it here:)|`|2BL6Ow4Maa	NO! im jealous of accents in america haha its cool. and having that style will get you noticed more and people are probably jealous :)|`|plBQDf7Taa	not at all. BE PROUD OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL AND DEFINITIVE IDENTITY!!!|`|ZLWAe4gBaa	Absolutely not!  In fact, you should be flattered.<br>  Most of the teens you see walking around your typical high school have taffy colored hair with highlights that's damaged and stick straight, and a fake tan.  It may seem attractive to some, but not always.  You sound like a very pretty young lady, and you should be proud that you're different.  <br>  The boys and girls at your high school probably don't look at you because you're 'different', but because you're pretty.  <br>  Embrace who you are no matter what anyone tells you.  It's okay to be your own person!  Plus, you don't seem out of the ordinary at all to me.|`|FVPOxaeJaa	Do you feel comfortable? I'm not really sure, it depends on your personality. If you don't like the attention then you can just ask your mum to buy you some new school clothes.|`|JSaRZagEaa	No, trust me its not. I feel the same way and I don't dress like anyone else. Your just notice more because your not look like everyone. Just stay you and that's how you know what friends are best for you.|`|HbHFJ2EXaa	its good to be individual<br>  and its not bad<br>  unless of course you don't like the attention|`|7rdbPZXbaa	no i like it when people stand out .., just be yourself ;)
3JkZPMvYaa	um well im not sure about the beach wave part but i know that u should probably work on your hair to fix it . first there is a hair mask and a whole revitalizing line by pantene u could get it like anywhere . next when u wash your hair and the water is on hot , always smooth it down because hot water makes the folicles open and pushing then up will damage your hair even more than it already is . finnaly finish your hair wash by washing it with cold water to seal the open folicle it makes it smooth and shiny. then when your hair is 70% dry put the shining-frizz serum . also u should lay off the products and stick to one brand that suits you|`|UuSmemr7aa	Always condition your hair(:

She's not ugly but her lips are a little big. The second girl is also pretty because her eyes are so big and amazing, nice hair too. She's not ugly either but she should wear a little makeup just to add color to her face. They're both really pretty girls they don't need to change anything about themselves.|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	girl 1: she is pretty but the shape of her head is weird<br>  girl 2: needs a fringe and look happier she looks half asleep|`|wgm9ADfBaa	i dont think any of them are pretty. average. if i had to say girl 2's eyes and lips are nice|`|xUCXXb73aa	the 2nd girl is cute|`|AGXysOpzaa	they are both pretty. <br>  <br>  Girl 1: has really nice eyes and a good facial structure. She is wearing more makeup than girl 2 so it is hard to comment on color. Her hair appears slightly flat in the back, so she should try and tease some volume into it.<br>  <br>  Girl 2: looks a little tired and should try a small amount of light eyeshadow to open her eyes up a little bit. the natural color of her lips is close to perfection, and her hair color has a good contrast to her face.

SLeX0gGaaa	Put hair rollers in your hair before you go to bed , then in the morning use mousse to scrunch it in the morning . :)|`|uOTD3qwZaa	I do my hair like that all the time! Buy whatever kind of mouse, gel, and hairspray you like first of. Have your hair wet, but not soaked, nor damp. When its when brush your hair so it's straight, then get a nice medium handful of mousse and rub it along your hair. Then flipped your hair over, while bending over and just go crazy, shaking your hair, and moving it around in a circular motion. Then get penny/dime sized amounts of gel in your hand and focus on one section of your hair and push your hair up and down, while squeezing your hair. Do that to your whole head, when you finished flip your hair back into standard position. Do then same thing again, but don't add tons of more gel, unless you prefer. Once you've finished grab sections of your hair and hairspray them, spraying from roots to tips, putting in as much hair spray as you please. If your hair is soaked or damped blow dry it in sections like you were applying your hair spray! <br>  <br>  I hope I helped(:|`|o3P4Ldfqaa	Hey <3 i tried this ages ago and it looked great!

Style back with a headband, i usually wear a bow headband. but DO NOT BRUSH<br>  8. Let it dry naturally, and it should be still wavy when its dry<br>  9.

aeNKRVEbaa	First of all, I don't really recommend drugstore brands because most of them usually smear or smudge under your eyes if they water at all.<br>  <br>  FOR EYELINER:<br>  <br>  Try MAC engraved Powerpoint.  It's $14.50<br>  You can get that from a MAC store or maybe a booth in a Nordstrom.<br>  <br>  You could also try an Asian brand, like Kiss Me Heroine liquid eyeliner from Japan.  I've used that before and it NEVER smudged or leaked.<br>  I'm planning to order that online because it works so well.<br>  <br>  The best thing that comes close to the Japanese Kiss Me Heroine liquid eyeliner would probably be Physician's Formula Eyeliner Marker in Very Black.  The only peeve I've got with the Physician's Formula is that it doesn't apply well over my eyeshadow and dries out somewhat quickly so I have to press it down harder on my eye for the ink to come out.  It's harsh on the skin around my eyes which sucks.<br>  But, you CAN get this in a drugstore or local Target.<br>  <br>  Every other black eyeliner I've used ranging from Maybelline to Cover Girl has smudged.<br>  <br>  FOR COVERUP:<br>  <br>  I use Stila Natural Liquid Foundation from Sephora.  I remember it being $38.  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to spend that much money, you could also go with the Loreal brand from Target.  It's the pressed powder foundation and has a lot of different shades.  The Loreal pressed powder foundation is about $8.<br>  <br>  My sister has used the Revlon cover up and although it's strong, that's not much of a problem since it encourages you to use less and then you'll get more for your money.  Plus, it's not nearly as expensive as the Stila brand and you can buy it at a drugstore.<br>  <br>  * I would NOT buy Maybelline dream matte pressed powder foundation because when I bought it, it was just too powdery and only brought out dryness in my skin.  It really sucked.  The shade of color didn't even look good either and it did a poor job of covering up my skin.  Almost as poor as Cover Girl..  Oh yeah, have I mentioned Cover Girl pressed powder foundation sucks the most?<br>  <br>  FOR BLUSH:<br>  <br>  I would use NARS orgasm color because I've heard it looks good on most.  But usually I don't use blush myself since my skin just naturally blushes to the point of annoyance. <br>  <br>  FOR LIPGLOSS:<br>  <br>  I've tried Wet n' Wild Lipgloss from Cover Girl and their lipglosses are pretty good in the sense that they look nice but also don't get gummy and icky on your lips.<br>  <br>  * I also recommend that you do NOT buy lipgloss from Maybelline.  I have in the past and they are one of the most gummy kind of lipglosses out there!  Yuck.<br>  <br>  FOR MASCARA:<br>  <br>  Cover Girl mascara is probably one of the best that you can buy from a drugstore.  Mostly because they are so very waterproof.<br>  <br>  You could also go with Maybelline which are popular with their mascaras and although they do indeed lengthen and volumize, they're still not all that waterproof even if they say they are. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for waterproof, I'd go with Cover Girl mascaras.<br>  <br>  I have been doing my research lately and have found that Sephora sells a Japanese brand called Imju Fiberwig mascara and it's supposedly supposed to lengthen your lashes dramatically and is also fairly waterproof.<br>  <br>  It's expensive though, around $23 for one.<br>  But I'm getting it anyway since it's all the rave right now.  >_<<br>  <br>  It's said that it's the top selling mascara in Japan and it claims to give a false eyelash look when you apply it.|`|gDf6afBYaa	your going to hate me for this comment but no make up is the best make up some of the most beautiful girls i have ever known have caked make up on since high school and only in private will be seen with out it......don't use it natural skin is more attractive|`|s1MbGhpHaa	KOhL

Theres human hair which is obviously human hair and theres synthetic which believe it made out of some plastic. The girls on ANTM probably used human hair weaves because they are high end and more expensive and which can be treated as if it is your  real hair.

I still have been using the same shampoo for a while now.|`|0am2d0n1aa	After a while your hair gets used to your shampoo/conditioner and it doesnt have as good an effect anymore.

I too have a tongue ring. and I did have the same exact problem. All people are different. and have different reactions. some ppl take alot longer to heal than others. I tried to change mine after two weeks. and it started swelling back up and was really sore. I decided to put the normal one back in. and i wated about anohter week and a half. and I downsized the barbell once again. and it worked perfectly. and went smooth. I have had mine done for 3 years now. and i guess i just took longer to completely heal from the outside in. But I also do have problems with flexi barbells. those are just something i cant wear. it has the same swelling effect. I have to use the steel ones. But I guess all ppl are different. and I hope everything works out. I love my piercing and I never get tired of it. Just dont give up and take it out. youll regret it i promise lol

0am2d0n1aa	i don't think this is caused by damage i think its new hairs growing through. i get this too sometimes around my hairline. you just need something that smooths them down. I use Tigi BedHead Ego Boost, but its quite expensive, but i'm sure any drugstore brand will work. Something of cream consistency that says it will defrizz will definately work (even if your not looking for defrizzing). Its best to just get a styling product like this as lots of heavy conditioners will weigh your hair down. You could also try smoothing it down with hairspray, that way it will stay that way? Good luck, hope i helped x :)

I dont see why she wouldnt let you. unless shes really strict. just get semi-permanent. it grows out with your hair.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	if your under 17 don't do it .. it will just ruin your hair. <br>  That is usually done by a professional then you get exactly the results you want.  Although my daughter is a summer blonde, her hair darkens and lightens just like that naturally.|`|qkiNLmPeaa	"mom, i think my hair needs a change. i want a new look. can i please die the bottom layer of my hair black? if you say yes, you wont regret it. please?" i had past experience....kinda. i want to highlight my hair, and my mom and i made a deal. if i cut my hair (its rly long), she will let me highlight. so im waiting for my hair to grow lojnger so i can donate it, then i can highlight my hair. we both r happy. the end. but if your mom says no, then you could probably work up for it. (ex chores, lower your allowance?, help out more)<br>  :]|`|32uGH3cVaa	i wouldnt do black.<br>  it looks bad.<br>  brown looks so much better with blonde, and not as fake.<br>  just ask her saying brown. <br>  and if you want it black, just get a dark dark dark DARK brown<br>  and when she says "wth child" just say it IS brown. ;) <br>  ask nicely, do chores and offer to pay for it yourself. <br>  maybe be REALLY nice to her a week leading up to asking. <br>  not a day before because then she'd think its just bc you want your hair done... which really it is, but she doesnt need to know that ;) <br>  <br>  lmao.|`|GdjfU5Saaa	that is obviously isn't black, it is brunette, i compared it to her top. blonde with black looks really fake and unrealistic so you should go with brunette underneth.|`|jsaQDQSZaa	just have a really good attitude about it like don't be annoying and beg her on your hands and knees just politely ask her and if she says no then try to comprimise like extra chores, you will donate hair, etc.  good luck!|`|GokGEXfiaa	hands and knees. grovel and look hungry. dont wash for a week for maximun pity.|`|K5KSeqTVaa	Get a can of the spray in/wash out stuff that you use for parties and try that out on the pretext that you're going to a party.<br>  <br>  This gives you the chance to see whether the color really suits you and whether your Mom actually does go ballistic when she sees what you've done. If she takes it badly then just go wash it out, if she seems OK with it then wash it out and use a proper hair dye on it.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do make sure the hair die doesn't stain the bath, basin or shower or you really will p**s off your Mom.<br>  <br>  The alternative is to do what my daughter does; beg forgiveness instead of asking permission!|`|AII8hJu9aa	you don't want black, you want it brown... black makes you look like a skunk (seriously... i've seen it) and brown should b easier to ask for permission|`|AA10480735	Well, tell her you really want the hairstyle.

It worked for my mom and if you like it you can always keep dying it..and then if you end up not liking it you can just wait it out and let it wash right out. hope it helped (::|`|sp1TB35Kaa	Do it yourself or behind her back and then she'll have to deal with it. I'm sure she'll like it when she actually sees it on you. That's what I did, and my mom loves my hair now.|`|JSaRZagEaa	don't dye it. Until your 18 and out of the house she won't care.

But he also likes the X-string thongs and the thongs with charms dangling at the top of the back of them. You should also try T-Back thongs thay are grate for low riding jeans. Thats what I wear. unless I want to be all Sexxy for my Hubby then his very fav. is the X-backs. thay are way HOTTT!!!|`|9e14b0ed13fe8a4e9f859c9f3ae46a02aa	thomgs|`|AA11903141	which is cuter is shorts <br>  which is sexier is thongs|`|AA12058465	Boy shorts are cuter and sexier.

Hmmm...maybe I should qualify that -- any girl who wants to wear a thong and look sexy needs to have the figure for it.  Don't have to be supermodel thin, but if you're more than 10-15 pounds overweight then don't bother.|`|f9cf888653ba31f81b726d18aebfa2deaa	THONGS ARE CUTER AND SEXIER.

But working out works, plus its good for the rest of your body! ?<br>  <br>  Oh you want to know what kind ok, um like squats those are were you grab maybe a 5 pound bar and you sqaut down almost 20 times. Do that everyday! ?
AA10629527	Regis is a chain, and the quality of what you get done there depends totally on who does your hair.  You might get a great stylist, and you might not.  It may be no better than a cheap-o place like the Hair Cuttery or the salon at Wal-Mart.  Some salon chains do have really high standards about who they hire.  Others don't.  I remember that I got my prom hair done at the Regis Salon at my mall when I was in high school.  My hair looked ok, but my friend who got hers done there, too, had a really bad style.<br>  <br>  Anyway, why don't you ask someone whose hair you like where they got it done?  And, don't just ask for the name of the salon, ask for the name of the particular stylist.  Also, don't go for a walk-in unless you just want a trim.  You will usually get put with whatever stylist doesn't have any clients booked, and there may be a good reason why they don't have any!  So, ask for a recommendation, make an appointment (you may have to wait even a month for a great stylist to get an opening), and then take a picture of what you have in mind so there are no questions of what you want.  If you don't know what you like, then ask the stylist what she thinks will look best on you, but if you don't want to go too short, be VERY explicit about it (like say "Absolutely no shorter than my chin").  GOOD LUCK!|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	yes|`|gZtOn36caa	regis is a chain of salons all over..if i'm correct i believe they are linked with supercut..it isnt the price of the work that makes it better..it is the stylist itself..do some research..dont pick the first name in a yellow pages...call around..make a consultation with your stylist of choice and dont be afraid to ask for a portfolio of their work..you be the judge and decide if thery are best for you..<br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck with the new 'do<br>  xoxox<br>  zowie
Y0w2Pk5kaa	Yes, its a common name but I like it|`|5oGdBwh5aa	Mine is kristyn. So its close. I like it :)
XaYHMNusaa	Yes it's normal since you just got it done.  Be sure not to over-clean it.<br>  Oh, and I've never gotten either of my traguses pierced nor have I ever gotten an area numbed before I got it pierced.  Seems like a waste of money to me [getting numbed]...|`|uJJPFJoyaa	The tragus will be swollen for several weeks, on & off, especially if it had been rubbed/ bumped against or messed with. Don't touch it with dirty hands, you should only be touching it lightly when cleansing the area w/ sea salt soaks, also do not over clean this can get the area real dry and can cause irritation. When I got both of my tragus's pierced I did not get them numbed because of the tolerance of pain that I have, also with my rook piercing.|`|zdHsiepwaa	if u got them peirced at Claire's than yes<br>   all my friends who got them peirced there had there ears infected!!!!|`|nn8AdxnZaa	yeah its normal....<br>  one of my lip piercings swelled up like a grape and they said that if it was this certain infection they might have had to amputate my lip! lol i didnt even know they did that! but it was just a normal infection lol all you need to do is:<br>  1)clean with sea salt water<br>  2)clean with anti bacterial soap<br>  3)get vitamin e pills and poke a hole in it and take a quetip and pit the stuff of your piercing<br>  trust me this works!|`|v2blcb5vaa	I'm getting my tagus pierced soon(:<br>  but from what you're saying you should probably go back to where you got it done at and ask them. They would be the ones to know(:
7jpaOKu2aa	No .... No no no i don't recommend this at all. Really don't please if you do tho like get them on your back like small .... no i changed my mind that would be alittle cool just don't get them on ur arms thats all i have to say|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Honestly at first i didn't like the design but once you hear the meaning behind it the whole tattoo idea sound good and i think it will look great. You should really get this. Good Luck!|`|tPFHLcisaa	I don't want to put you off, I like the idea but I think they would look nicer some where else. Maybe your back. I think you should have them where you want them though. I'm getting stars on my ankles so I guess every tattoo is not to everyone's taste, that's the idea, I suppose.|`|LcAiHBsaaa	i think they're rad... i would consider a different spot tho... are you talking about the back of your biceps? (like, if i was standing behind you and you had your arms at your side, i could see them perfectly...) 'cause if so, i think that would be awesome placement.|`|2SOq2ZI2aa	nice. <br>  their flippin sweet!!!
jGqZdS2xaa	Probably, because guys arent like girls. If they dont like you then they leave you. If they didnt like you then they wouldnt give you the time of day. So my answer is yes, they probably do like hanging out with you.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3|`|pD6K1rLkaa	they seem to like hanging out with you in class, but other than that, not as much. but as you get to know them more, you'll probably become better friends =)|`|u6HndVxaaa	well i know this guy who stopped hanging out with this group of girls because they took all of jokes seriously. guys don't ;ike it when girls are spastic, so yeah, they like you!

If you trim some hair off of that point, you will have a much nicer shape to your brows. I wouldn't thin out anything else, just that one area.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise!!!<br>  <br>  But I have to remind you, it's not is on the outside that counts the most. It's your attitude and your heart that is most important, make sure you work on keeping that pretty just as much as your skin and hair are beautiful!  Ok?  =)  <br>  Someone out there is waiting to appreciate you, for who you are!  Go find em' girl ;P  lol|`|cJAf4pU0aa	I am the same as you, never been told it was ugly by anyone, maybe it's just the guys your picking, are too white, I am just guessing.

YFUOYJwgaa	the shaving it will come back thicker is a myth, i saw it on Oprah, the reason it seems that way on like legs is because it comes out wide and then goes thin, like any hair. but if you don't want to do that that is understandable, Nair would work there and you could also bleach it, but for best info on laser removal i would ask your health insurance, or look on webmd.com<br>  <br>  either way good luck|`|GiMJULi7aa	you can bleach them so u cant see them as much.|`|CVHZlKRMaa	grow them out then tuck them  behind you ear|`|Zk5PTmrfaa	bleach them so they're lighter.<br>  <br>  don't shave them because they'll grow back spiky :3|`|IuG0fgg2aa	I have the same problem.

GIV6biNtaa	First, some tips on your look: <br>  1. Wash your face twice a day and apply a lightweight oil-free formula (make sure to do this is you have oily skin or acne).<br>  2. For hair, go to a nice hairdresser. He or she will analyze your hair and talk to you about possible cuts/colours. She will also give you tips on taking care of your hair at home (shampooing, conditioning, blowdrying, styling etc.)<br>   3. For makeup, use some cover-up, and a light mineral powder foundation ( Bare Minerals works phenomenally). Use a little bit of mascara, but don't apply too much or it'll clump and look tacky (go to Sephora and try out different brands to see which makes your eyes look best). If you want, you can use a little eyeliner to get a little bit of a edgier, sexier look (if you're new to makeup and don't know how to apply it, go to Sephora and ask for a "makeup evaluation"). Last, use some lip-stain (BeneTint works great), and apply some peachy lipgloss (without sparkles; they look tacky).<br>   4. For clothing, keep up with the latest trends, but also make sure to have some basics for your wardrobe. Here are some basics I suggest you invest in: <br>  A. 3 pairs of nice jeans ( A nice boot cut that flatters your frame, and 2 skinnies). Some good brands are American Eagle, The Gap, Abercrombie, Hollister, Lucky Brand, True Religion, Joes, Paige, and Sevens. <br>  B. 5 tank tops (Get some basic colours you can use for layering, ie navy, brown, yellow, pink, white). I would suggest Abercrombie for these.<br>   C. 5 Tee-shirts, they can be logo tees, etc.<br>   D. 3 Long sleeved thermals, logo shirts etc. <br>  E. 10 blouses (meaning things other than tanks and tees). These will be the main piece of your outfit. I would suggest shopping at Urban Outfitters, Abercrombie, The Gap, or Nordstrom for these.<br>   F. 2 Sweaters/cardigans (Abercrombie and Urban Outfitters has great ones) <br>  G. 2 Sweatshirts/ jackets (Abercrombie has great ones, but they're a little pricey). <br>  H. You should get five pairs of nice shoes: A pair of nice sneakers (Coach has some cute ones), a pair of sandals ( Gladiators, Strappy, with kitten heels, etc.), a pair of flip flops (Abercrombie or American eagle has cute, comfy pairs), a pair of flats (Juicy Cotoure has some nice ones, or shop at Nordstrom), and last, a pair of nice heels (black or red is best for an all-around formal shoe.\<br>  Above are the basics of your closet. Other pieces you may want to consider are a couple dresses (you can wear flowy dresses or blouses over skinny jeans), a few skirts (a denim skirt, a miniskirt, a skirt that ends right above the knees, and a nice flowy skirt), some shorts (denim, cargo, plaid etc.), and some original separates such as a jumper, a romper, some leggings, a pair of funky boots, some belts, or even a tutu. Try to stay original and fresh-don’t fall into wearing or looking the same way every day!<br>  PS. Don’t try to look sexy for a guy, he’ll just think that you’re a ****. While you want to show of that body of yours, you don’t want to show so much skin that he confuses you for a stripper!<br>  5. Many say that the best way to get a guy to like you is to have a great personality! Here are some tips for how to act and talk around guys:<br>  A. Be polite, refrain from cursing, talking behind other people’s backs, or making fun of anyone in an unkind way when you are with him.<br>  B. Show the real you, but try to refrain from giving away weird details about your life, your friends, your prior romances, or your thoughts.<br>  C. My advice would be to become friends with him before getting romantically entangled- take it slow!<br>  D. Once it seems like you have a good start, ask him for his e-mail or IM screen-name. If he gives them to you happily and willingly, go so far to ask for his phone-number.<br>  C. When chatting on IM, emailing, or texting, be casual. Ask him about sports he does, his favorite TV shows, his friends. Tell him a little about yourself, what you like, your friends…etc.<br>  D. When talking on the phone, be layed back like you would talk with your girlfriends. Mention subtle hints about other guy-friends, or say that you’re going to a movie with a guy friend.<br>  E. At school church, the beach, the fair, whenever you are actually together, make a point of talking to him, maybe mention an earlier phone-call or chat. Make sure that you don’t chat with him like best friends, but never talk to him in real life!<br>  F. Once you’ve been hanging out for about a month, gather a group of girlfriends and join him and his friends at the lunch table, or somehow gain group interaction with your friends and his friends.<br>  G. Once you feel like you’re really friends, ask him to go to a movie with you, or wait for him to imply that you two hang out outside of a group. Movies are great because you don’t have to talk much. Consider going to a friends party “together,” going to a school dance as “just fiends,” or going mini-golfing etc.<br>  H. As long as you keep the relationship moving from there, it will most-likely bloom into|`|8dnwrn1Vaa	guys like girls that take care of themselves. So take care of yourself. Do things like wearing make up but don't over do it. Keep well manicured and well grooming. Keep good hygiene like brushing your teeth, shower, and keep your nails clean. Smell good: wear perfume, use a nice smelling shampoo that's good on your hair, and use a good soap that smells nice but gets the job done. Wear nice and neat clothes. Keep them clean and look very girly and feminine. Guys like to feel that who they're dating can't be more a girl, if that makes sense. Wear dresses and/or girly things like necklaces or rings or earrings. But don't over do it. Keep the shoes nice and clean, not sloppy. Example of sloppy: those really torn up converse that are "in" right now.|`|mmMgfhf2aa	Be confident, not needy. There's no denying that men like a pretty girl but the ones that keep their attention have a lot more personality to go with it!|`|NF0fUntZaa	talk to them and U ask them out. see how it works out. dont go to crazy though. lol|`|WOPRzF31aa	CONFIDENCE<br>  Strut whateva uv got|`|6uVcWZkqaa	A picture would help|`|mi3Udvroaa	walk around naked.|`|qYgXwYXNaa	lk at them
WYa3UY6Gaa	Well I hope you know that you will have to get your parents to come with you to sign, and show proof of who they are to get it. <br>  <br>  It could range anywhere from <br>  <br>  $125 - $175<br>  <br>  Maybe more depends on exact size, amount of detail, and where you go Everyone's prices are different.<br>  <br>  I would suggest not getting it. What if you need a touch-up <br>  <br>  You can't go to New Hampshire it's 18 as well. <br>  Cant go to Vermont it's 18<br>  Can't go to Massachusetts it's 18<br>  Can't go to Rhode Island<br>  Can't go to New York<br>  <br>  <br>  ___<br>  <br>  So the closest place that allows tattooing on someone under 18 with parental consent is Connecticut.<br>  <br>  So when you need a touch-up are you going to travel all the way back over there. It's really no worth it. <br>  <br>  If you don't believe me check the tattoo laws<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.everytattoo.com/tattoolaws.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.everytattoo.com/tattoolaws.sh...</a>|`|LcAiHBsaaa	it varies... i pay my artist 125 an hour plus 25 bucks an hour tip...<br>  <br>  ALWAYS TIP! a lot of people don't know that :) you don't have to tip 25/hr like i do, rate it on how good you think their work is (just like how good the service at a restaurant is...).|`|XaYHMNusaa	Usually, tattoo artists price by the piece.  And by the hour [if it would take a long time to do].  Just go to a shop and get a price.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Depends on where you get it done at. If you have the piece already done out, printed or drawn to exactly how you want it, take that to the shop you plan to have it done at and see what they would charge. My guess is somewhere around 200 but since I can't see it that's justa a guess I could be way off. Some places also have you put a deposit down so they can hold your appointment for you, if the artist is taking time to see you they want to make sure you will be there. If you don't show you don't get that money back and it does not go towards the tattoo cost. If you are under 18 I doubt you will even be able to get it done. Every legal studio will not work on anyone under 18 without a parents consent and you want to go to a reputable studio. Just wait it out until you are of age, maybe by then you'll have changed the design a bit more.
9mHYXrRJaa	Really i recommend you don't get them. Yes it is very painful after for about a few months and really you cant breast feed your baby, if you will have one. Just think about that. Will a man not marry you and not have children with you if you have no chest? i mean look at amanda binds.. lol she has nothing and she is just so Beautiful all on her own. If you have a baby you will never be able to have the bond you could have with her or him.. So think very carefully :)|`|c26Ae2y1aa	Not as bad as they look. Please, please don't get them.|`|5MTFXnGfaa	yeah my mom got them and she said there almost as bad as labor pains<br>  and they look really unnatural on her body and she only went up one size you shouldnt get them you will have to replace them in 10 years cause they get really saggy and then you cant tell people your all natural and people think small breasts are beautiful too, all breasts are beautiful.

GBC39wHAaa	It means it got returned because it cost more money to send than what you put on the stamp. When you put the extra $.34 on it, take off the label they put on there, add the $.34 stamp and re-mail.|`|0W0JwfAcaa	i think that it needs more stamps to get to its destination. so they are giving you a credit of 34 cent postage.|`|7XGjs8cyaa	sometimes the envelope might be to thick or whoever you sent it to didn't want it.|`|6j1H4Zl9aa	they do not want you to write to them|`|pD6K1rLkaa	you might not have the right amount of postage on, or put it on wrong somehow?

8GeNdCsIaa	first STOP washing it. u shouldnt be getting it wet at all. if its looking flaky its because ur skin is pealing. thats normal DONT pick it though or u will loose the color of ur tattoo. its healing. just apply the cream stop washing it and let it heal.|`|HOdblqIkaa	What you are using, coco butter, is probably your problem. You should be using an A&D ointment, tattoo goo, or curel on your new tattoo. Don't use anything scented and normal hand lotion isn't good for it. Go to your parlor and get an ointment for it or go to the store and get curel or another ointment. Don't use neosporin either. Don't pick it, that will pull color out, and when you wash make sure you are using an anti bacterial soap and no loofa or sponge, just clean hands. Pat it dry never rub. Peeling and scabbing is normal it should last around a week or 2 if your tattoo still isn't looking any better by then go back to the artist.|`|M7tszm4laa	Why are you washing it every 3 hours and using cocoa butter?!??!?<br>  <br>  You should only wash it a couple hours after you FIRST get it. After that, don't wash it and keep your showers to about 10 mins or less. You should have been using ointment (like Aquaphor) 2x a day for the first 3 days, then after that switch to a fragrance free lotion and apply that 3 or 4 times a day.<br>  <br>  Didn't your tattoo place give you directions? Holy crap.|`|bRIYQGKjaa	Also stop using coco butter. Use a non scented lotion.

e0c2ec01b5f406ac6dfa1a34259ce8ebaa	I think you need 5 sets of 3 min. your skin needs rest from time to time if your under the heat of the sun. Don't forget to drink lots of water you might get dehydrated.|`|6t191pnJaa	if your 14, you shouldnt stay out there for more than maybe 20 minutes..? and if you would to stay out there longer, you should try sunlotion so you dont get burned.  :)

WGFtXo6Paa	Wear a low spf sunscreen. I would say wear spf 15, and when you start getting a little red, put it on again. SPF 15 still lets you get some color. Or, you can stay outside fora short amount of time, and then leave.|`|236548a8801617d43a073b2dd4d83f35aa	Ok, if you have really fair skin then you need to be really careful!!<br>  People with really fair skin have to take tanning very slowly, and use SPF.  Definetly higher than SPF 15.  It is recommended that everyone should wear at least SPF 30 everyday to avoid damaging rays that cause skin cancer.  My skin is a little fair, so on my first day I never stay out longer than an hour and definetly wear at least SPF 15.  If you go out then wear at least an SPF 30 and don't stay long.  If your skin starts feeling hot you have had enough.  Be careful and pay attention to your body....burning causes skin cancers.  Looking good now could cost you your life in the future or possible really painful surgeries.|`|dPKLjohXaa	well u shuld start out with some medium spf sun tan oil/lotion. then make sure u flip over every so often  so that u dont burn as easily and make sure to give ur skin a rest every once in a while. maybe get up and go for a quick swim or something. good luck:D
oZPtaJPKaa	Yes, you can try lotion that will give you a natural tan look. Jergens sells one that's only like $5 or so, and they have different shades so you can match it to your tan. If you're looking for a spray, Sally Hansen makes one for your legs for about $8, but I've never used it so I don't know how well it works.|`|c26Ae2y1aa	Jergens Natural Glow Daily Moisturizer works well on me. It brings out your natural glow, especially in the sun.|`|40963de8d813844e4c10a9c20347555daa	i live in RI and here we have a tanning salon chain called "exotic tans" and they have a tanning thingy (for lack of better words) that you sit on a chair and put your lets in this thing and it just tans your legs, it works great for someone in your position. maybe you should look around your area for a tanning salon like that...<br>  also, i used aq sunless tanning lotion and it works well...its by banana boat and it has a lotion along with the actual tanning lotion and you customize the degree of tanning you'd like, so you start light and then work towards the darker tan. i like it.|`|9uAmjfgzaa	If it is sunny where you live, be in the sun with tons of privacy. Cover up all tanned areas and tan the others. Then make it even until the sunny time ends. :-) hope this helped.

I guess..<br>  Not many people wear flipflops in Canada during the winter though. ;)|`|GKQJRJAMaa	Neither. I would go with a polo and light wash loose jeans. Brown leather flip flops, converse, or nikes.  Or... A t shirt, plaid board shorts, an sneakers. Btw out of ur two options, number 1 was better.|`|4QfyirQjaa	Option 1 :)|`|vrfuO9Asaa	personally for me option 2.x|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Number one for sure! It makes guys seem kind of preppy, but cool as a cucumber at the same time.|`|5kRtTmvhaa	option 2, but with skate shoes:)|`|iNPO8q0Laa	Ooh I love guys in polos. Number 1!!|`|KfeeV5nraa	the second|`|RYiSYJvTaa	1. The tighter tee shirt makes guys look idk... weird... like kinda odd I guess. The polo shirt and cargo pants with tennis shoes looks hot ot me. That's the guy I'd have a crush on. The other dude for some reason reminds me of Nikko from spectacular and his tight shirts made him sooo not attactive.|`|InzHK1rcaa	CARGO PANTS? ha don't wear cargo pants, please. :) me and my friend were laughing about cargo pants yesterday... do jeans if your gonna do the polo. <br>  <br>  I like Option 2 but option one works if he's wearing JEANS not cargo pants.|`|kZzasq1laa	Option 1<br>  you can go with a tight tee shirt and cargo pants too though...<br>  but definitely not just option 2...sounds like a hollister wannabee model or something<br>  haha<br>  so ya<br>  certainly option 1 if i had to pick|`|vzVsP4bkaa	they sound like they would be the same guy... i really can't believe this many people are answering this question lol. but really, just wear what you want to wear. asking a bunch of random girls makes you seem like a tool.|`|PL6M6Y2raa	Well girls have different options on what they like in a guy, personally i would def choose option 2!!, i always wished more guys would dress like that rather than baggy pants and baggy shirts with skate shoes|`|SWsDa1iXaa	hm... i like both! But it depends, can you pull it off? If it doesn't look right on you then don't bother, but if it does, go for it! :D|`|NaJPIOheaa	neither...<br>  <br>  i'm the, baggy Dickie's shorts, skater shoes, and t-shirt, kinda gal ;)|`|dvjC9YEeaa	umm you seem preppy;; uhh you can try option 2, if you have agood body it'll look pretty hot.|`|ded2181b98ab4c89b217681e47f520ecaa	option 1 :)|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	The poster is a douchebag.|`|8dnwrn1Vaa	the 2nd, but try to dress how you like, not how other people like lol. Good luck (;|`|MvDu7hZmaa	Guy #2.  I love flip flops.|`|nkCvNUR5aa	1 but im sure you'd look good in either one.|`|QevBVANtaa	the first with vans.. <br>  flip flops on guys are UGLY|`|9oUl1gFcaa	opt 1|`|GBOgsAoDaa	i like 1 more but both are hott:)|`|ISRTiSnoaa	Good one. Haha. I guess i'd have to go with the first one, just because the second one can be bad if you wear the wrong shorts with the wrong shirts etc. like don't be wearing red and blue plaid (btw its called plaid) shorts with a pink shirt, get it? you can be matchy, or you could wear a white shirt with that. If you are skinny/buff, you can probibly pull of the tight t-shirt, but don't go wearing one if you are alittle on the heavy side and you got some man boobs, because thats kind of  aturn off to most girls...|`|45sFKbORaa	This all depends on your personal style.<br>  Are you the kind of guy who is chilled and give off the impression that you are laid back? If so, go for option 1.. You can never go wrong with a polo.<br>  If you want to give off the "I like to party and have a good time" kind of person go for option 2. <br>  I think I personally like option 2 :)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|FDq7fEZMaa	option 2 sounds hot. <br>  i would like a guy who wore a tight american eagle top, and get some weird random shorts that no other guy would choose ( make sure you like them.) and get some oddly colored flip flops (:|`|L726SIwVaa	i love option 1|`|lVy77BExaa	I would say Option 1, because if you look at Calvin Klein's designs the preppy-guy look is getting increasingly more popular. Its very sexy. :)|`|HbnhpnL8aa	Option one because when a guy wears shorts it looks gay on them unless he is at his house doing nothing. I have nothing against gay guys but personally, you should wear option number one. :)|`|d6W62zKaaa	Option 2|`|kBYdS2IQaa	DEFINATELY no sandals! anyone who wears sandals gets a no no from me and you are suddenly considered gay, so id go for the first one ssweetie;)|`|BFWza3SJaa	Option #1. :)|`|ABZIchDgaa	Option 2 definatlly that wat this guy at my school that evr girl likes wears|`|xMJ2r7Vcaa	option 2|`|Qcntioxiaa	Both are boring and unoriginal.... I see these guys a thousand times a day. Why not just go with what you like? <br>  <br>  But I guess if I had to choose I'd go with option 2... it's more laid back|`|ugBFeMkKaa	option 1|`|rmePp5BMaa	option 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  especially with the curly shaggy hair. ....|`|PRi3qIJEaa	option 1 but buy a hollister white collar shirt guys who wear hollister are HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|boY7017Daa	both ugly. but that is just my opinion in my opinion u should go with tight jeans and a tight concert t but that is just me.|`|swADiFLhaa	definatly dont wear flip flops most girls hate that <br>  i'd go with the polo n cargos|`|sUb69Cdzaa	i'm all for the tighter shirts and checkered shorts.|`|oahKtNA1aa	1. :) x|`|OOTYgIpHaa	option 1, flip flops on a guy are horrible|`|PIo1yT2Xaa	polo shirt!|`|JPB6fgQiaa	Depends what your legs and feet look like, no girl wants to see hobbit feet in flip flops!|`|Y5IZdvQNaa	1|`|mFX18yxTaa	tighter t's show off muscle... so im gonna go with choice 2|`|MJXPcowDaa	flip flop guy... make sure uve got a 6 pack tho under the tight top!|`|Bd4cGbEXaa	option 1 cause it is more laid back and cool|`|gdVpLMz8aa	They both sound nice babe go with what suits you best sexy!!!|`|bxKOaIISaa	def. the first one<br>  :]

tzMMFPr4aa	Nope, no padding. she's naturally that size.|`|z0tk6XSvaa	shes really that size
oDtuygT6aa	get a new bag.|`|0eIIhokiaa	splatter like an off white paint on it so it looks like really worn and cute<br>  maybe put like a handprint on it or something with the paint|`|kZYEXGZzaa	llbean will give you a new backpack  for free if your old one is damaged ;)|`|4UXJoMbKaa	Ok, so here's what you do. Gather up some old skirts and clothes that have more boho style prints. Go to JoAnn's or Micheal's and buy those types of fabrics. RAID the remnant section! At JoAnn's they have a rack of the leftover fabric from the rolls. It's in the fabric section; as someone if you need help. Find accessories that fit your style-buttons, pins, ribbons, w/e. Get some needles and thread and go at your bag. Add patches-if you want, you can cover the whole dang thing with patches. Add buttons, ribbons, tassels, pins, beads, WHATEVER. Boho is kind of being your own person-make it you. Make it your style.<br>  <br>  And most importantly, HAVE FUN.<br>  <br>  :)|`|rXInAcURaa	i think you should just get a new one, i cant really help you with out a picture?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.grownupgladrags.co.uk/USERIMAGES/17.SunBohoBag.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.grownupgladrags.co.uk/USERIMA...</a><br>  <br>  i guess you could pair it with fringe boots.<br>  <a href="http://www.shoppingthetrend.com/celebrity/images/morfeoshow/miley_cyrus_-5151/big/miley_cyrus_11_wenn2038296.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.shoppingthetrend.com/celebrit...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shoestretchers.com/fringe/3layer.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.shoestretchers.com/fringe/3la...</a>|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Well use it who cares it's only a book bag.|`|q2mTip6haa	color on it with sharpies.. or put some pins on it.. <br>  or just get over it... its a bookbag.. jeez.|`|Qce2U2LEaa	Labels are overrated. Just do whatever you want to the bag without thinking of what "style" it would fit under.|`|uKdEr8x4aa	stick some ribbons on it. get a new bag. color it or paint it. be creative. i think thats what boho people do.
jL0Y27g2aa	dye them like turquoise so that when if fades it will match<br>  i did the same and it looks great!|`|TLMqNwmMaa	i think so cuz black goes with anything...plus depending on the shade of blue im sure it will look fine...check this out and read what the people have to say below <a href="http://www.advicenators.com/qview.php?q=130522" rel="nofollow">http://www.advicenators.com/qview.php?q=...</a>|`|k5S5OIH8aa	Keep them black hun^_^<br>  Black and blue look totally good together.<br>  And it would be kind of awkward with blue eye brows!|`|jxxWZoHeaa	dont dye your hair blue, it goes green after a week.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Dye them red.. *sarcasm*|`|4UXJoMbKaa	I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure they won't stand out too much. If you really want to, you can get special dye for your eyebrows. If you're a girl, get some dark blue eye/brow liner and fill in your eyebrows with that.|`|ik7afC7Haa	Dont dye your hair blue as someone has said it will turn green thats what happened to my friends mum, and if you do carry on to do the blue hair thing then yes dye your eye brows it will look better in my opinion|`|MSzjOOOjaa	dye them blue...haha|`|jJjW9hx7aa	that would look fine if they are black. it'll look cool|`|R0OGzRAJaa	ya just keep them blak itll look good trust me :)
0H63P4jAaa	black|`|hkzGYQD4aa	Definitely not cherry red or purple. If you have fair skin, I would go with blonde. If your skin is darker, then I would go with black. <br>  <br>  =]|`|IyNxIiQYaa	i wouldn't go blonde. there's this brunette in my school who did and it looks ridiculous. but if you decide to, consider your eyebrows. they won't match haha.<br>  personally i like the black or purple|`|QvhPJAKyaa	well the red and purple are horrible. i would never get my hair died those colours. i like the black and blonde.|`|vzYJJCdqaa	Black|`|1CoVG4jNaa	black second one|`|cyt7oh97aa	The purple will only stay purple for like a week and then will go redish.  Black will never get out, and you'll have to go blonde any way to get that cherry red because your hair is brown.  so start blonde and work your way to red.  if you dye it red right now it won't be cherry, it'll be more burgandy.|`|ZtePw7Xmaa	definently the hayley red if u have fair skin or the blond but if u dont and have darkrer hair then the black or you lcaun do the top mostly black and do what ever color you want on the bottom visa versa|`|JefxLLVxaa	<a href="http://avril-source.com/gallery/albums/c..." rel="nofollow">http://avril-source.com/gallery/albums/c...</a>|`|C0pk4kgJaa	I don't like the red or purple. I like the blonde|`|1d189d211710842a2fef70f9f5dbf40baa	i like the cherry red and blonde.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	i like the red<br>  <br>  <br>  ps: ur pics of black hair are more like a dark brown..|`|XPShnPIlaa	cherry red<br>  black<br>  blonde|`|UdICTUnaaa	dark purkle|`|lTOVnotSaa	I like the red and purple ones :)|`|INwEnAENaa	the reds really pretty|`|SQQFnb3Qaa	Black|`|Eej0Ndp5aa	I'm not really a fan of the whole head just one color.. I have the same hair color & length you described as you having & it's dark brown with blonde & red chunks, & I LOVE it.<br>  <br>  But some ideas would be doing the "halo" thing I think it's called. Which is like the bottom layer one color & the top another. Make the bottom something bright like red or purple & the top black! That would be cuute! Or if you're more preppy get like blonde on top & red or purple chunks on the bottom.<br>  <br>  You're the only person who can tell which color you would look best with because you know what you like & look like. Just remember it's something you gotta keep up cause no one likes bad roots :)|`|GNa37oJXaa	well i would go with cherry red all though thats not the exact color of cherry red i have in my hair its a little different i <br>  do have cherry red blond and brown high lights in my hair and i love it <br>  and i think that you would be<br>  happy with the cherry red cause <br>  if you have brown hair the blond would look orange and you would probably fry your hair and end up having to cut it off my close friend has darkbrown really curly hair down to her but and then she colored it <br>  blond and it looks orange and she had to cut it up to her sholders so i would go for a darker color|`|qI4BvLioaa	I'm kinda partial to purple because I've dyed my own hair purple a couple of times. The only bad thing about having any "strange" hair color, especially if it's a really bright neon color, is that if fades pretty quickly so you have to keep up with it. If you're not willing to go in every couple of weeks to get it touched up, I'd go red or black. What about streaks? Pick a base color (like black or whatever) and streak sections whatever crazy color you want. Black with cherry red streaks would look pretty sweet.

It costs somewhere between $8 to $12 just for the upper lip, depending on where you go.<br>  <br>  Also, the results usually last about a month or longer, especially if you're not sporting a man style mustache, and in my experience, the hair grows back thinner and finer, making it less painful when you continue waxing.|`|QGZBlceuaa	I get mine done for $5 at this salon down the road.

AA11306011	2-4 Months Don't Worry You'll Be Ok I Got Mines Pierced March 5th,2008!<br>  Just Be Careful You Dont Wear To Tight Clothes<3|`|4hzPCxmyaa	I just got mine pierced today. My piercer said that I shouldn't swim for at least 2 months, but preferably more.. Chlorine is more likely to cause problems, it affects the healing a lot apparently. On average, they heal sometime aroun 4-6  months, but it can take up to a year or more to fully heal. It depends on your body.<br>  <br>  It really doesn't hurt. When the needle went through, I winced, and that was it. If you said "ow" it would stop hurting by the time you finished saying it. The piercing hurts more after getting it than it does getting it. Mine ached for about two hours after. Now it only hurts if I move too much. It hurts about as much as a second or third lobe piercing, possibly less.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	It  takes atleast 6-12months for a navel piercing to heal fully. It also depends on the persons body and how quick they heal to wounds, the healing process will also depend on you when it comes to taking care of it. If it gets irritated or messed with while its healing this can delay the healing time and cause it to take much longer to heal. It took exactly 14 months for my navel piercing to heal because I stupidly changed out the jewelry after the 5-6th month which caused it to get irritated for several weeks. If you get your piercing done this month, theirs no way that piercing will be healed by summer, more like next year around this time.<br>  For those who are saying 2 -4 months!!! thats outrageous, by 2-3 months your navel will possibly still be slightly sore & oozing lymph because of healing.|`|QGZBlceuaa	Belly piercing takes 4-6 months to heal. I wouldn't recommend getting it done now unless you plan to start swimming in July. (even then it's a little too soon, I believe)<br>  <br>  It hurts, but it's really not that bad. 2 seconds and it's done. It'll be sore though, but it won't be that bad either.<br>  <br>  Mine has never gotten caught on anything clothing. At night though, I tape a cotton ball over it to prevent it from getting caught on my blankets or something... because it has happened and it hurt for a while. It got better quick enough though.<br>  <br>  My belly piercing is 3 months old and I know for sure it's not healed yet. Depending on how good you take care of it, it may also be a while.|`|XaYHMNusaa	Thye can take up to a year to heal completely.  I think mine took a year or less.  If I were you, I wouldn't swim this summer [it wouldn't have healed enough].  Two big mistakes people tend to make when they get their navels done is changing the jewelry too soon and getting it contaminated by pools, hottubs, lakes, etc.<br>  Oh, and mine didn't hurt much when I got it done...just a quick pinch.  And I've never gotten it snagged on anything [I've had it for 3+ years].|`|CBi633Caaa	RETARD!!!!

Just research and find out more info about it|`|AE6Rap6vaa	HONESTLY.....Bleaching in a great route to consider....you can get really mild over the counter bleaching really cheap and its not painful. I do wax every once and a while too but....It wont always do as good of a job and you'll have to do it at night  because it will make your upper lip a little red and tender for a while and you wont want to go to school with that...lol...even doing it on the weekend would be smart "just in case" . There is nothing to be shy about when it comes to this subject as millions of woman have this same issue. Just remember, waxing and tweezing can be painful and you can bleed from it....Bleaching is easy, fast and NO PAIN!|`|8dnwrn1Vaa	I think waxing is your best bet if you don't want to bleach it. It does make your hair thinner after a while but make sure to keep it up to date. I bleach my hair and I like it a lot for the upper lip, you can barely notice it and have to look very, very close to see it. Best thing ever. However, it does come back after a while. You can try to buy an depilator that pulls your hair out like a lot of tweezers working at once and you can do it at home. Nair didn't work for me because my skins very sensible and my mom, a pharmacist, says that so many harsh chemicals may cause cancer as a long term effect. Good luck! <br>  (:|`|IpzapGwgaa	that's your only choice! you can't wax hairs that fine, and you can't tweeze them, you either HAVE to bleach them, or use nair face cream!|`|3z6lwCHuaa	Yea, it will probably make it a little darker and somwhat thicker..So you would have to tweeze, or Wax, often.|`|wxaYxH4zaa	Im not sure if this is correct, but growing up I was told that shaving will cause the hair to grow faster.  When I was about 13-14 years old, I started waxing. If you do end up waxing, your upper lip will be red for quite a while so dont plan on going somewhere right after.|`|3NkvoKtsaa	I think you should just tweeze it. It will be painful, but better than leaving it. It doesn't make it darker. Even shaving doesnt do that! The only reason the hair looks darker when you shave is because you arent used to it there! Just do what you wanna do tho. Hope this helps.|`|gw7GoKAraa	Ok calm down. It will get darker and thicker. I suggest waxing it. You will wax it almost every few months. Hope this helps.

qaiKG1Z2aa	How much is it costing you? You'd be better off getting a real tan, while enjoying yourself on holiday. Why pay someone to give you skin cancer when you can pay for a holiday and get some real fun out of it, with a good holiday story to go with the tan. You should be proud of your natural skin tone and be looking after it, not damaging it with the sunbeds.

If you are able to tan in the sun, then you will tan in a tanning bed.  I would not start out at 8 minutes.  Start with 4 minutes and see how your skin does.  Be sure to use a lotion meant for tanning beds.  It's important to keep your skin moisturized during and after the use of the bed.  You should wait a couple of days between visits in order for the tan to develop.  You might be able to go every other day.|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	First you need to realize that tanning beds are a prime cause of skin cancer even if you use lotions....later in life they can cause it too.

600tkYoYaa	that cut would look amazing on you, <br>  but your gonna have a hair time maintaining it like that,<br>  since your hair is really curly, and you need it straight.<br>  you're going to need a really good straightner tooo , but <br>  honestly, i don't recomend that .. you're going to burn and<br>  damage your hair, but if you want to, then you could, and it<br>  would totally work for you. <br>  =)|`|5dDNqwlzaa	Your hair doesn't look fine enough to be straightened to that point.  It will look frizzy and not nearly as nice as in the picture.  Since your hair IS curly, it will be HUGE if it isn't straightened, that's a very layered and choppy haircut which will make your hair very poofy.  You would have to straighten it every day if you want it to look like that and you'll probably damage your hair beyond fixing and eventually have to get it cut.<br>  <br>  The cut doesn't seem like you and I don't think your hair is even capable of it.|`|2wZcWe98aa	yes i love it! deffinatly do it!|`|RbyK5biSaa	maybe.......personally i would just get a lot of layers, i wouldnt take that risk.|`|MbFS6XFQaa	OMG NOO DON'T GET SCENE HAIR POSER!<br>  <br>  lol jk! jk!

Now, if you are happy to do that then great, but you have spent forever growing your hair and by straightening it every day, you will end up ruining it to the point that you will have to get it chopped.  I think you will have to go for something where you can embrace the natural texture of your hair.  You have lovely hair, so use it to its best advantage!|`|y2O1D8q7aa	I think that you could!<br>  But your honestly going to have to straighten your hair like CRAZY!<br>  <br>  im indian and my hair is like a HUGE poof ball i literally have to straighten my hair every day!<br>  <br>  its crazy!

There's no reason to buy new or expensive clothes JUST for camp. Save the new clothes you buy for places OUT of camp, like school, going out with your friends, or partying! I don't think anyone will really care what you are wearing, they'll probably just care about how nice you are, or if you are a good horseback rider!

To combat this use petroleum jelly on your face followed by a warm moist towel then reapply jelly. Keep a pill bottle full of jelly in your purse to refresh your skin and lips.

Ingest lots and lots of water (so your urine is close to appearing clear), avoid alcohol, caffiene, get your self a good moisturiser and take luke warm baths / showers - not hot ones! Also, try a humidifier at home.|`|2KUdefSBaa	Winter air is drier, especially in colder areas so the moisture from your skin gets sucked out.|`|rtk9flZ9aa	stronger colder winds....|`|Wmn5Bh1Zaa	Your skin needs moisture to stay hydrated and flexible.  When there is less moisture in the air, your skin's reaction is to dry up.  It's like comparing a leaf that is still attached to the branch of a tree, and a leaf that has fallen off the tree last week.  The one that is connected to the tree (hydrated) is healthy and works fine, while the one that has fallen off (dehydrated) begins to dry up.

jGqZdS2xaa	Yeah, I think her style would look really cute on you! To get your hair like hers, I would dye your hair 1 or 2 shades lighter and go to your hairdresser and ask for a layered haircut. Also, bringing in a picture of her might help your hairdresser to recreate that cut on you. As far as her makeup, she seems to go very light. Maybe a little bit of foundation and mascara. Highlight might work well too. To get clothes like her, just wear lots of skinny jeans, flowy shirts, Converse, t shirts, ect. Her style seems to be pretty casual.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3|`|EY0wnkh3aa	She's pretty when they fix her up and do her hair and makeup for her. Ya I think the style will look awesome on you because you look like her in a way. Definitely go for it. Finding her type clothing is easy cuz all she wears is jeans and tank tops and Converse. I don't know why the vanity fair pictures of the Twilight Cast were so... dirty, lol. But ya you could print out a picture of Kristen's hair and show it to your hairstylist.

f8bf26c17d2b021c337d130648b25311aa	I got mine done today, and I was TERRIFIED, I was sweating and almost in tears and felt like I was going to get sick and It was seriously the least painful thing i've ever had.  It's so easy, and if you concentrate on squeezing someone's hand you'll be fine.  It's so cute|`|rSXZOU5zaa	It makes your eyes water, but not from the pain. It doesnt really hurt at all, i dont know how to describe it, though. sorry.|`|7fbuXvilaa	Why would you get ur nose peirced?|`|AA10784867	ummm its only a little pinch|`|qe7UHQ2uaa	u see when u have ur period, that is how it hurt|`|sNr9Od89aa	Super Dog says:<br>  It felt like a sharp pain, and because they don't numb it, it hurt me a lot.

My belly button hurt way less in comparison.|`|AA11530122	Ok.  well 4 me it hurt like an 8 outta 10.lol.  and i have my industrial done and it hurt worse then that.  You'll hear like a popping sound and then feel a sharp pain from the needle...then another sharp pain when they drag the stud thro.lol.  but hey its worth it if u want it bad enough.  and it'll bleed a bit but not alot.  I recommend looking up nose piercings on youtube.  Thats what got me prepared 4 how they did mine. You'll be fine! and enjoy urself while ur getting it done.  otherwise its not worth it.lol.|`|r1Vg6djRaa	the pain is not really a factor you should be worried about, its just like piercing the cartilage on your ears, but its not as much of a pain in the a*ss..lol<br>  it will make ONE of your eyes get really red and water lol like you've been crying but only on the side of the nose you decide to pierce. lmao its kind of funny..but out of the people i have pierced they say it was quick and didnt hurt that much.<br>  just be prepared for scar tissue to form on ur nose (like a little bump) a few weeks after u get it done...it might happen but doesnt happen to everyone..<br>  most people come to me all feaked out lol but dont worry about it, it happens to a lot of people, mostly if you have really fair or dark skin. but it usually goes away after a while if you take care of your piercing.<br>  anyways best of luck to you & i hope all goes well if you decide to do it :)|`|NNzsX31oaa	it doesnt hurt. it takes literally a second for the gun to go through the nose. <br>  and its over. it doesnt hurt. maybe a little pinch for the second it goes through the nose.<br>  <br>  and then u have to wait a couple weeks if u wanna change ur nose ring. that hurts a bit. <br>  but as long as you dont touch it and dont mess it and clean it daily it wont hurt or get infected .|`|iaOfP1OTaa	From what I've heard it's like getting your ears pierced just it's your nose so it's gonna hurt a little, please don't be like the stupid people in my school and do it yourself though|`|9f3H3xSAaa	I heard it hurts for like a second then its done real fast.like a second. i got my pierced but me and my friend did that at her house and the process went slow,it HURT. but im sure it'll be just fine if you go to a piercing parlor and do it,totally worth it.
arUe7267aa	If you want to trade diamond jewelry for good price, you must make your deal with trusted stores like ebay. Provider your diamond details to the Jewellery store.|`|XrcZkt6Haa	if you want to sell your diamond jewelry for a good price, you must take more time to evaluate its real price. First, you can take them to different jeweler and ask them the diamond details first, the clarity, color... Then go to other shop and find the same piece with the same stone, see the prices and compared. The prices of diamond jewelry sold at big malls should have about 50% price off, then the real cost left.   You know the real cost and the common price, then you can sell it at good price.  Don't compare online, since some online diamond jewelry is of much low grade..|`|MuWth0wyaa	You could try an estate jeweller.  They deal in quality pre-owned and vintage jewellery.   As jewellers they should know what they are looking at and relative values.  I would think they would be a better choice than a pawn shop.<br>  <br>  It would be best to have an idea of your current jewellery's worth first.  Remember that an insurance value is replacement for a new piece at retail prices so used jewellery is not going to be worth the same sort of prices.

2ZsRAxkuaa	I use Jojoba Oil or Vitamin E oil myself.<br>  But I like Vit E more, cause it helps break down any scar tissue, and I think it smells alot nicer.<br>  <br>  I'd avoid Tea Tree though. Its very strong ad irritates skin fairly easily.<br>  You can also use Emu oil and bio oil. But they're rather expensive.<br>  <br>  I get really dry flakey skin on the outside of my lobes, and a nice vit E oil massage very other day or so works wonderfully for me.<br>  You can buy it pretty easily in health shops, and some of those weird food shops that seem to sell nothing but nuts and seeds and vitamins...|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Try Emu oil or tea tree oil :)<br>  Massage that on your ears :)<br>  <br>  I have stretched ears too.

I would say deffo go with one of the three brands you have listed as they are affordable drugstore brands.  You are 14 and really shouldn't be forking out for more expensive brands.<br>  <br>  Personally I would choose the Almay.  You get a built in sharpener which is really usful (saves you buying a seperate one!) and Almay are known for being good for sensitive skin and personally of the listed ones I would chose that.<br>  <br>  In my opinion although Avon's prices are good the quality of thier products vary from item to item.|`|ILNNfCJSaa	Almay. : )<br>  <a href="http://www.almay.com/Pg/Main/CatProdDet.aspx?catid=32&catnm=Eyes&subid=231&subnm=Eyeliner&prd=28568&osubnm=Liner" rel="nofollow">http://www.almay.com/Pg/Main/CatProdDet....</a>|`|F0sr7Tpcaa	almay with built in sharpener definitely|`|UEsUiRoiaa	Liquid eyeliner isn't good for beginners, so don't worry.<br>  <br>  I suggest Clinique, it's very easy to apply and they have tons of colors. They're usually Clinique stands located in Macy stores, and specialists there that can help you decide what colors to get. Watch out, it's a little pricy, but theey're like, top of the line.|`|GJrXwkkiaa	I would get almay, there really good with eye liner and the water proof one stays on a lot longer and kinda gives that sexy smokey look. Revlon is usually for older people and is kinda nappy and avon is kinda a cheep brand. I think best eye liner is m.a.c or lancome. Eye liners from departmant stores are usually better, but for other stuff only sometimes.  But if your looking for cheap go for almay.|`|gOfkr23gaa	well revlon colour stay eyeliner because it is great and it is quite good for youngling's like you ,i used it when i was 14 too and now iam 15 n still using it|`|TL9gEbh0aa	Revlon.<br>  My nana uses Almay!|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	i definitely would not recommend liquid... that's the WORST if you're just starting!<br>  <br>  uhh<br>  i wear revlon colorstay<br>  i like it<br>  but i would suggest getting a primer to put under it, because if your face is oily, it gets all... weird looking :/|`|q4SA3r07aa	Revlon, stays on long.
5jsMY4RIaa	Yeah, that's normal. I did that in high school.<br>  <br>  I went to HS in Colorado so in the winter it was always chilly in the school since they never seemed to turn the heat on. So it was, wear your jacket inside or shiver.|`|7DJkwzKDaa	Well we don't have lockers, so everyone has to take around there jackets and either hold them all day or wear them.<br>  I hold them lol :]<br>  Umm yeah both of my sisters have North Faces and they are EXTREMELY warm and comfy!!<br>  Maybe thats why.<br>  I don't think you should get one and blend in though :[<br>  Unless you are looking for comfort, they are much better than sweatshirts!<br>  <br>  Answer my question!! :]<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090307121350AA7mQ8K&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	yeah everyone at my school does it... they're really comfortable, but they are just.. i don't know not my style.. they seem so like "hey i don't try to look good, nor do i care!"|`|AA12298826	It's a matter of how much you're trying to fit in.  That's what you're really asking here.  Do you find this to be really important?<br>  I find wearing Hoodies to be a big thing at my college.  Back in high school, sweatshirts were popular.  It varies from place to place really.  Fashion is not 100% anywhere.<br>  Fashion is personal.  I personally don't view it as fashion, as I wear most things from a point of view of comfort (admittedly, I have my own question up about boxers/briefs for women, lol...<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307132638AAB3fN3)">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  Will you stand out for not wearing North Face?  Maybe.  The real question is whether or not that is important to you.  It's also a matter of HOW you stand out.  If you stand-out because you're bald female (no offense to those of you who are), it's rather extreme and may not be a good idea.  But, wearing a sweater instead of a north face jacket isn't giving that same effect.  I'd, personally, notice you as sticking out a little bit more, but in a GOOD way.  It seperates you from the flock.  In this instance, it' probably a good thing.<br>  Just a guy's opinnion, however, so take from it what you will.  Hope that helped.  :D|`|er1jmyhBaa	Actually at my school hardly anyone ever wears North Face jackets, maybe it is because I live in Southern California. <br>  <br>  Think about it. Do you want to wear the same jacket everyday because everyone else is doing it? It gets boring after awhile. If you want a quality jacket than get it, but feel free to wear something different the next day.

AA10370707	On some people its cute, on others not so much. Personally I think it looks cute.

You will hardly ever look good in something unless you feel good in it, and wear it confidently.

You haven't indicated that you have any obsessions with your weight such as measuring or weighing yourself daily.  If you don't diet or do anything to control your weight, then this is your natural body. I do admit I think you are thin, but I don't necessarily think you are anorexic.  Some of my friends back in high school had very fast metabolisms, and because of that, were extremely thin.  You may be the exact same way.

4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	It depends on how bad you want it.  I'd say wait a little bit longer, like maybe a few months and if you still want it really bad, then get it.  I'm 21 now and in my third year of college and I got mine pierced when I was 13 and in 7th grade and I don't regret it.  As far as how bad it hurts, they numbed me when they did it, but it just felt like a quick pinch and then it didn't really hurt at all afterwards.  And I have a labret (which oddly I was going to get a lip piercing on one side, which weren't as in fashion back in 2001 when I got it, but the woman who did the piercing did a labret mistakenly [which was cool and common back then], but I almost prefer that now since side lip piercings are way too common now), but anyway, my point is I guess snakebites are okay, but they are what's trendy now, so maybe in a couple years you might not like them the same way. But if that's what you like the most, I'd say get it.  And if you end up not liking it later, you can always take it out.  When I take my piercing out, there's a slightly noticeable hole, but it's not too bad.|`|boqwvEvUaa	it's not whether you're goth or emo, it's whether you can pull it off or not. trust me, i haven't met one person who actually looks good with a lip ring--most of them looked really trashy or desperate, imo.
AA11879371	Depends on the guy.  Some go for the legs, others go for the chest, etc.  Most of them, however, don't want to think about falling off!

Some like toned flat stomachs, but plenty of guys like a bit of fat on a girl's belly. Some guys like a lot of fat on a girl's belly. If a girl has nice legs and a soft belly, I think a lot of guys would love that. I find that really hot myself.

If u can, sleep on your back with your face in the air, and you won't get so many pimples, or wash your pillow case often. Also wash ur face when u shower in the morning, and make sure u wash your face AFTER you wash your hair. The stuff in shampoo and conditioner really makes ur face oily and causes breakouts.<br>  If u frequently get pimples u should order proactiv, u do the same thing but after u have popped them and washed them out u put on this green stuff that cleans deep in ur pores and then this white stuff that heals the skin. you can literally make all your zits dissapear over night (if they aren't to severe and u havent been over popping them) with proactiv.

Generally, for each inch in difference, the cup goes up by one size. See the conversion chart here.<br>  <br>  Example: <br>  Step 1: 34" under measurement +4" = 38" band<br>  Step 2: 40" over measurement<br>  Step 3: 40" - 38" = 2" or Cup "B"<br>  Your size would be 38B|`|xqQO81Omaa	If the bra fits on the band but the cups are too small then yes you need to try a 34C. But if the bra was too small on both the cups and the band, then you need to go up to a 36B.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	no<br>  it means your actual breasts are to big so u need to move up a cup size<br>  if your chest is bigger, rib cage...then u go up in inches|`|VQfDXVl5aa	Here's how it works. The number that comes before the letters (34, 36, 38C) represents the width starting from where your breast grows out all around the back. The bigger your back is the more band you need. The letter (A, B, C) represents the actual size of just your bust. So if you're not getting wider and it's just your bust that's growing, then you just need to change your cup size. Remember, most of your support needs to come from the band and if you end up wearing a band that's too big for your back, then it's going to constantly ride up your back and you won't get the most out of that bra since it loses elasticity the more you wear it. <br>  <br>  If you're not sure what your size is, there are places to offer bra fittings. At Victoria's Secret, there are bra specialists that offer free bra fittings and they can also take you into the bra wardrobing center to try on all the bras in your size to see what you like. Bra specialists are there to give you the ultimate fit. =) If you can't get to a Victoria Secret store, go to victoriasecret.com and there's a guideline you can use to measure your own bust. Good luck =)|`|0tr1cR3Gaa	nope thats wat i thought i went up in the # when u need to go u the letter the # i believe is the measure around ur bust (rib cage) the letter is ur cup size measure if i remember it right so ur boobs r getting bigger n rid cage is staying the same|`|rJPBF33taa	The # refers to the inches around your chest.<br>  The cup size refers to breast size.<br>  Your breast size and your inches can increase and decrease with weight loss/gain.<br>  Simply try on all the choices and choose the one that feels the best.<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|abg9qu9Saa	the number in front of the letter measures how big you are around, not how big your boobs are, so if you need a bigger bra you would go from a to b to c to d, but if you just need a larger back strap, like where it hooks, because its too tight, then you would go from 32 to 34 to 36. so you would probally need a 34c.|`|8sfrIoUCaa	the number, 34, 36, 38, is the width of your rib cage <br>  while the letter, A,B,C, is the cup size <br>  <br>  so yes if your in a growing stage then you probably need to jump up a cup size

Surface piercings have a high rejection rate. Dermal anchors look similar but have a smaller rejection rate. They are also not piercings, but surgical procedures where they insert a piece under your skin, and you can screw in jewelry.<br>  Since it is a surgical procedure, you need to be 18 to have it done, and it is more expensive than a normal piercing. Also I'd assume it hurts more than a piercing, though I've never experienced one.|`|l43ZB7o8aa	I suggest you to not do it.Its not very beautiful

I love being pale (weird I know) so tanning my legs, (although it helps conceal the dark hair) is not an  option for me. I use nair a lot, but since you can't ... I suggest the smooth away pads. They're "as seen on tv" but they reeeeeally exfoliate the skin well.|`|om5pY14Baa	Same happens to me!

This should be as close as possible to your skin colour. If in doubt, go for a little lighter, never darker.<br>  Then put foundation on. Not loads cuz it will only make the pimple more obvious.

But, some women's breasts grow HUGE when they become pregnant; I know someone who's breasts were like an A cup and grew to some ridiculous size... like an E/F cup!<br>  <br>  <br>  Learn to love your body; it's not all about boobs; it's about personality too. You have years for them to grow yet. Stop trying to rush your body to grow up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your boobs aren't too small; so, don't worry about it. Also, if you go on the Pill; some people's breats get a bit bigger. But, only choose that option if your periods are really heavy or irregular. Because, making your boobs a slight bit bigger is a dumb idea for the Pill. lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope i helped :) X|`|TrEYixLXaa	A B is not bad at all, but  you should wait until you are 18 atleast.

They are not a bit small. Also the age that your breast start and stop growing matters on who the person is. I am 14 and mine are completely grown at the size of 36C and I can tell you right now that I hate it and can only wish that I was a 34B. People are built differently and you should love yourself for who you are on the inside not what does or doesn't grow on the outside.|`|uj9GjzdOaa	I've heard they can continue up until 21.  Are you going to have kids one day?  I recommend waiting until after kids because pregnancy causes your breasts to get bigger (even if you don't plan to nurse) which ruins them--implants.  I speak from experience.  I was a 36B, went up to a 36D.  Then got pregnant and they got up to F's!!!!  Already been stretched out to a D, that was as far as my skin would stretch.  Once they got bigger, they're now full of stretch marks and sag half way to my belly button.  I had cancer, and treatments...wasn't suppose to be able to have kids, and now am happily blessed.  Wish I would have known I had an egg in there.  Now I have to have a lift and get them redone.  Just wait until you're done having kids and who knows, maybe by them you'll get bigger boobs and not need a boob job!  You also have to buy bigger shirts, etc.  I wish I had my 36b's back now.|`|BKUhGTHdaa	They keep growing into your 20s, and often get bigger after pregnancy. They can also get bigger if you start taking birth control, though I do not recommend taking that purely to make your breasts bigger. Yours sound like they're at a normal size, and they're still growing. Don't worry about it.<br>  And believe it or not, lots of men like smaller breasts.|`|WLf4ny64aa	I am a doctor and it depends really.  I cold give you better info or an idea if i knew more.

My piercer said that the other kinds of jewelry that are used are: twisters,circular barbells, and captive bead rings. Captive bead rings usually aren't used because most people can't take them off by themselves, they have to go back to the piercer.|`|x59qaJuzaa	it's called a curved barbell or a banana barbell|`|SMVsmzi4aa	its like a bar that looks like the bar that people put on their ears...uhh kinda
pxlu5Wgqaa	Ok. Personnally, i don't find it cute at all.<br>  But if you like it, you need shoes to go with it!!<br>  So i would wear it with white shoes to make a contrast with the black.<br>  So if you feel comfortable in heels, go with them, definitely.<br>  But maybe flats would look good with it you know, cream flats.<br>  I am sorry, i can't show you pics of shoes because i live in Québec, Canada and there is no store like in USA and England.<br>  But still, i hope this will help you to choose your shoes.<br>  Good luck :)|`|8QhPUxllaa	That is a really pretty dress!<br>  I think that you should wear white shoes and then a white clutch bag which would all match however if you are feeling confident why don't you wear red shoes? and the team it with a red clutch and Accessories (just don't over do it) ?<br>  I think the shoes should be high and a thin heel.  I think matt shoes would look the best not shinny :]|`|B3uvhA7kaa	That's a beautiful dress!!!!!! But you do have to wear black heels with that, if not it won't look good.<br>  Are there Macy's where you live? I couldn't help but notice the dollar sign on the website. It's different. If there are Macy's, check out that store.

DD6jZc5faa	Hi! I use to have the same problem when I was younger. I don't really know about getting rid of them fast, but what I use is a loafer, which is a body brush, and gentle rub that over my legs. It helps remove the dead, dry skin that sometimes clogs my pores. And now I hardly ever have that problem. Hope this helps!

CO1CiN6Haa	I hope you are not serious? If you are and your mom will not let you then something is just not right. As a mom myself and an adult, there are some suggests I will give you. 1. Sounds like your mom will not listen and will not change her mind, therefore go to the store a lone and buy2 bras, put one in your locker at school and put it on when you arrive. 2. Take the other bra and hide it at your house for the weekends and just get a really big purse to carry it in until you can change it. 3. Take a bra to your best friends house where you go on the weekends. 4. I would never suggest going behind your parents back, but you need to be wearing a bra. 5. I guess the best thing would be to get a good friend of you moms to talk to her, maybe she would see the light. If your mom has a friend, female, that you feel close too, go to her and tell her. She might talk to your mom, but you can ask her to go buy you some bras. Hope this helped.|`|NnwA73B2aa	Maybe your grandma, aunt, cousin, or a trusted teacher could talk to her. I know it's embarassing, but you are a young adult, and if you want something, you might just have to ask for help.<br>  <br>  If you CAN'T get her to let you buy one, they DO make padded undershirts (camis and tank tops and such) and tank tops/camis with built in bras. They don't support much, but at least you aren't bare. You can wear them under all of your clothes if you prefer, just like a bra.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|LeQiljr7aa	Hey, thats very strange that your mother won't allow you to wear a bra. You should try sitting your mother daown and not just "hinting", but out right telling her how you feel. you should tell her that you feel self conscious and imodest without one. If she still dousn't budge, then i would suggest buying one regardless, i mean you can't just not wear a bra at this age.|`|Xy7Vjctoaa	Wow I am sorry<br>  Just go to the store with a close friend and buy a bra. Hide it and whenever washin it wash your own clothes. <br>  If you aren't able to do this wear a bikini top underneath as a last result. <br>  Or at least tell her plain out that you need one. <br>  Or even tell her when you run you need!!! a sports bra then just wear it all day. <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|6VtvX56Saa	hmmm, thats very odd that your mom wont let you wear a bra...but you should sit down and talk to her. tell her how uncomforable and embarrassed you feel. also tell her, young girls NEED to wear a bra when they start, "developing". i started wear a bra when i was about 12.|`|Yq2N1a2haa	Try wearing sports bras?<br>  talk to her, maybe even your dad..!<br>  if you tell your dad he might be like "ewww, gross here's some money to go buy yourself one!!!!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  My mom didn't let me shave my legs till I was 14 and a half!<br>  imagine that too!<br>  I feel ya! a little.. kuz i started wearing training bras when i was 8 hee :P|`|muOxoDGOaa	That is really stupid! Your mom should be the one saying, "Honey, you need a bra," and she shouldn't be disagreeing to it. That is extremely rude of her. And at 14, your chest is really growing. Just ask friends if you can borrow some of their bras if your mom doesnt budge|`|0QRTXIL2aa	save some money and buy one yourself. if you cant do that without her knowing, ask one of your friends to buy one for you or even ask to have one of theirs. good luck.|`|nnRBufFoaa	that is sooo weird that your mom wont let you get one!! <br>  your 14.. go to the mall and go with a friend and buy one and just be descrete about it.|`|pxlu5Wgqaa	Buy one with a friend<br>  Tell your mom that everyone looks at you weirdly and that you are sad (ideally cry)<br>  Or ask your dad.|`|hPDQGtdJaa	let ur mom know that ur a growing young lady and u need that support, tell her ur 14 and by now  u need it and its embarrassing at school|`|aZX8ltttaa	Im not being rude when I say:<br>  <br>  Dont ASK her for one, tell her you NEED one.<br>  Its honestly no big deal. And if she refuses buy one yourself.<br>  <br>  Best of luck hun.|`|RBcPCirJaa	So, You change with no bra on?! & People see your boobs?! Eww! Well, Are you flat chested?! If so, Maybe that's why you don't need a bra!|`|AA10784867	umm maybehh try training bras|`|kbrHFsr0aa	go to the mall with a friend and get one.|`|UEsUiRoiaa	I think you should go to the mall without your mom and get your own bra.<br>  <br>  I started wearing a bra in the 6th grade before I even needed one. It was just because I didn't want to be half-naked in the locker rooms. My friend had the same problem. I suggested to her to by undershirts with built in bras. Try talking to your mom again, but don't whine; be mature. Try talking like you're writing a persuasive essay.<br>  <br>  Say, "Mom, I'm 14 and we all know that I'm growing, and it's time that I should wear a bra, not just to keep me comfortable, but for the other people around me.<br>  <br>  One, PE is very uncomfortable when we run, I'd much rather have something to support me . Also, When I'm just walking to class or standing in the lunchlines, people can tell I'm not wearing a bra and they're disgusted and it's hurting my social opportunities. (that's probably not true, but it's a good reason. She wants you to have friends) Furthermore, when we change into our PE clothes in the locker rooms, lots of the other girls are grossed out, and make me feel self consious. Not wearing a bra really takes a toll on my self esteem because people give me dirty looks all the time, and they make me feel really insecure. I just want to ask you two things, Mom, when did you start wearing a bra and why won't you let me wear one?"<br>  <br>  <br>  Tell her this when she's in a good mood too. ;D<br>  <br>  If she still says no, there are two things that come to be true<br>  1) You're mom is surely crazy and troubled<br>  2) You can tell this to a friend and ask if they have any old bras that they never wear.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Bg8HOMtraa	wow..  i started wearing bras when i was 8 even though i didn't need for about five years.  now i'm 16 and size 34 D, so you never know when you're going to hit that growth spurt.  tell your mom everyone is wearing them and you feel embarrassed that you dont have one, or if you have a grandma or aunt close to you ask them to take you.|`|jb5v7kn0aa	Talk to another adult. Maybe they can talk to your mother and/or take you shopping. If all else fails, buy one yourself. Good luck!|`|xk5XK6CPaa	Id wear one anyway... ibet its rele embarring i bee nwearing one since i was like 10! <br>  <br>  Save up like 10 bucks go to walmart and get one for you self!|`|W76Lzh3caa	talk to her about it.<br>  go buy one by yourself|`|govpgOhqaa	seriously. if you mom doesn't let you now, she won't let you no matter what you say. <br>  Buy one secretly. It's benefitting you AND everyone around you. <br>  trust me. XP<br>  Just go to the mall with your friends one day and buy one from a department store. You can usually find them pretty cheaply. <br>  I have no advice on how to talk to your mom about it, and if she finds out you've begun wearing a bra, then who cares. The worst thing she can do is throw it away. <br>  (and if she threatens to do that, just wear it all the time. Literally)<br>  <br>  i hope this helps.<br>  and good luck|`|3yacqUltaa	Tell your mother that you are 14 and that you need a bra. Tell her that you show through t-shirts and that all of the other girls have started wearing them. Explain that you have matured-you are not a little girl and you need to start covering your chest when it shows through shirts. Good luck!|`|44RpLWb7aa	that's ridiculous. i started wearing bras when i was 8. you need to get someone to talk to your mother about this if you're not able to convince her. and if not, then save up 15 dollars and buy yourself a bra. every girl should have a bra at age 14.|`|oBvFYIXJaa	just buy one yourself|`|6U4sl15uaa	All I can really tell you is if your mom gives you a couple of dollars here and there try to save it up and go buy your own. I was 14 when I got my first bra my mother kept telling me no too. My step Grandma came to live with us because my step dad was disabled and my mother was working full time so she came to take care of us when she realized I was 14 and had never worn a bra she took me out myself and bought me one. The first bra I owned was a c cup. My step grandma chewed my mother out so bad it was funny.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Wow that sounds bizarre, at 14 I was a C cup I could not imagine not having a bra at that age. If your mother is being that ignorant get one yourself talk to a friend talk to someone what is your mother going to do when you start developing into a woman...lock you in the basement. Bizarre just bizarre|`|gySggMMCaa	ask your mom if you can get a training bra, like the ones with no padding, theres no reason for her to say no to that<br>  if somehow she still says no, they ask her if you can go buy camisoles (like girl verson of unsershirts) those should help enough|`|yk3d5jsPaa	Blatantly ask your mum why you can't wear one, tell her how embarrassing it is, especially in the changing room at school! <br>  If she's still being weird about it, buy some yourself, and wash them when she's out.|`|b4v2zdHZaa	thats a really tough situation!!! im sorry but i dont know what to tell you!<br>  <br>  tell your mom that you REALLY need one!<br>  im 13 and ive been wearing bras since i was 9!|`|UJZZ4bnLaa	talk to your school nurse or guidence counsler  they  can  maybe help  talk to your mother.|`|DEkQe6Zpaa	I suggest you show her this question.|`|BGKLrcRiaa	tell her that you can end up with saggy boobs like that, and that you NEED a bra. it's true!

If you know what i mean.<br>  And for a base for eyeshadow i would use a simple moisturiser :)<br>  Oh and i just today bourght Boots expert, anti-redness serum, i dont know what its like yet but sounds good, you could try this if wanting to get rid of redness :)<br>  Boots is a U.K shop by the way so if your american, sorry but dont know if there is anything like this there.<br>  Hope your awards ceremony goes well :D|`|5AyoYsBkaa	I recommend using Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse.

Something that will enhance instead of feel all heavy. I suggest Mineral makeup. I use bare minerals, but there are other brands out there to try. It may take a while to catch on if your used to liquids. I love bare minerals. Been using it for 8 years. it just diffuses any problem areas.<br>  urban decay makes an awesome primer for the eyes.  Too faced has one as well. If you go with the urban decay primer potion, check out several videos on you tube where they get out the extra from the tube when you think the tube is empty. Amazing. Don't use concealer for the eyes.. its greasy and creases your eyeshadow. Go with a shadow primer.

oSvwWFEIaa	You usually don't get to pick,most of the time you get the bar-bell that they use , they want you to use the surgical steel that way it doesn't get infected they tell you everything you need to know ,what to use after you smoke I forgot what it's called but ,you put a few drops on your tongue around the ring with a Q-tip .make sure you clean it everyday.after a couple of weeks you can go and pick out any kind of ring but just remember that their are different sizes. Don't be scared it hurt less than your ears!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12306087	Buy lots and lots of soft foods to eat for the next week+!  Your tongue is going to hurt like hell.  And eat a big meal before you go, because it'll be the last for awhile.  Don't buy the small Listerine bottle, you really do need the large and use it often throughout the day.  It hurts bad enough when everything goes right, I can't imagine what an infection would be like!  I wouldn't smoke ANYTHING for awhile.  Like I said an infection would suck.  I got mine pierced in 8th grade (8-9 years ago) and if my parents would've let me I'd have stayed home from school I was in so much pain for a couple of those days!  They were strict though, I did it to myself.  I don't wear mine anymore because I'm a nurse and they don't look professional but I did enjoy having it for the time being.  I wasn't ever a "punk" and that's not the look I wanted, I was just fascinated with it!  Just get a plain old barbell for now with a ball on each end and look on ebay for more when you're able to change it out.  Good luck and I hope it doesn't hurt too bad!|`|j9axB0YMaa	Your going to want ice on hand and eat before you go because it's hard to eat for a few days. Plan on eating things that don't require chewing. I'm sure your not supposed to smoke but I'm sure I did, just make sure you listerine after you do. And you'll probably need a bigger bottle that a travel size.|`|QMbxBynZaa	just make sure the ring is sterling silver or something nice, like gold or something or you'll be prone to infection !!!<br>  & haa you have to wait a little bit to smoke the hookah pipe, like about a week or so :)|`|1rHmtCdLaa	i got my tongue pierced last firday and i love it and dont they choose the ring for you? and make sure you buy mouth wash WITHOUT alcohol and you have to rinse your mouth after you eat for at least a month|`|DFaVrzBGaa	i want mine done too :)<br>  but im you should buy it with out alcohol in it<br>  and i think smoking hookah would be really bad for it
mPMp8UGnaa	i'm about the same size, and i would go with the regular medium. It may be a little big, but it's better than being too small|`|1ZvveYfGaa	The Y means that it will be a shorter length|`|QzfHwGOQaa	Regular Small
bfGB49VBaa	I have 3 eyebrow piercings right next to eachother and they were never rejected. I think if your first one is completely healed, it shouldn't reject it. Goodluck!|`|TrTfowAQaa	some bodies do well with being pierced other bodies reject it... mine rejects it...where ink is fine holes are not. but that's my body. if you have not had it a year yet I would wait til its closer to the year mark for hole number one. at that point you will know if your body is cool with it or not... if your body isn't still sore or moving the jewelry out by then you should be fine with hole number two...regardless of where it goes ;) good luck!|`|kxlmcG4gaa	No, just make sure that the first one is properly healed otherwise your body might reject it as its too much to deal with as you've got like 2 open wounds to heal at the same time.|`|wzMhhJi9aa	I have my done twice....I have them both for about 2 years.... have not had a problem with either.... just make sure they do it deep enough and its not a problem|`|x6bMwoAUaa	Your body will not reject your eyebrow ring just let the first one heal. It is almost the same if you have earrings and you want to pierce another one, your body will not reject it.
ojceQQ1Paa	No.  Quit asking.  You will never be able to look like that picture.  Surgical manipulation of looks has not come that far.  You are who you are and you will never look like that picture (which is also photoshopped).  So just accept yourself.  You will be much happier as soon as you do.|`|XqzPkogaaa	I dont even see a link.<br>  O_O<br>  <br>  I looked at your questions and you scare me...

7RUqEJzLaa	Definitely use semi permanent hair dye just incase you don't like it so it's not as hard to get it out. If you are using a box dye then do a strand test first. So just incase you don't like it, it will only be a strand of hair and not your whole head. <br>  I have heard that black is very hard to get out, so if you are sure you want to do this and are sure that you won't change your mind after a couple of days then go for it and good luck. <br>  And black will definitaly stay in your hair so don't worry about it fading.|`|7nrhPCf0aa	use semi cause it will come out easier if you don't like it<br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmbyfK3PMI9l9MEz6nls3KLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307132056AAkrnUs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|zlXofrG4aa	If you dye your hair black you better be sticking with it for a year or two because trying to get black hair dye out is awful.  To go any lighter than dark brown you'll have to bleach it several times and treat your hair to rebuild it.
FT1CPcwVaa	i don't have perfect skin but honestly my skin is at its best when i'm using the acne solutions 3 step. i still have breakout and scars but now my breakouts are starting to go away quicker. i've used it for about a month now (i've used it on and off in the past) and my skin is improving little by little. the only part that has benzoyl peroxide is step 3. for my skin it's gentle but however i don't know if it''ll be that way for yours. so that's just my experience with these products so far. and of course all skin types are different. good luck!|`|gDsdbTsUaa	It didnt leave any marks or rashes on my face and it works pretty good.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AVWHK3PWaa	its not that gentle i mean its full of chemicals wich drys skin u need to use a gentle cleanser and a oil free moisterizer go  to the dermo and see what they recommend or use aveeno and make sure to hydrate your skin dry skin causes pimples

I do because I find that dandruff shampoo is thicker and conditions better. <br>  2) It shouldn't come back because dandruff is a bacteria and the shampoo should have killed it. However, many people with dry scalp think they have dandruff when they really don't and it may come back. I have very dry scalp so I use Herbal Essences Smooth and Sleek because it is very conditioning and I have no more flakes!|`|pU1fAci6aa	1) yes you can, but its best if you just use the T-Gel.<br>  <br>  2)well, use it for a couple of days after its gone, then go back to using your regular shampoo.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|AA11070360	it's been two months since i was told this (the best 2 mo for my hair ever) don't waste money on dandruff shampoos. instead, every time you wash your hair with your HE add 1 tblspoon of sugar to shampoo and wash/rinse as usual. oh and only wash hair with cold water. try it. i did. and i a SOOO THANKFULL

vamM6jOFaa	i am all for tattoos.  i say get one.  try to start off small though, to get your parents used to the idea.<br>  <br>  the design and the placement are totally up to you, you have to live with it for the rest of your life. it really isn't too wise to be taking tattoo ideas from strangers on yahoo answers.  :)<br>  <br>  as for the giving of blood, i think you have to wait 6 months to a year before you give blood again... just so you can make sure there is no trace of disease or anything.  but i'm not entirely sure since i don't give blood.  <br>  <br>  if you do decide to get one, after you find a design.. make sure you wait and think about it for a while.. don't just rush off and get the first thing!  <br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|9lT4e8Efaa	owww do get one! tattoos are awesome but don't get like a tribal one because they are way common or someones name; might regret it later! you should design one yourself then you can have something personal that no one else would ever have.

4CVIfTBlaa	just breath<br>  okay so getting your nose pierced doesn't hurt that bad<br>  i hate pain and honestly for me bumping into tables hurts more than my nose piercing<br>  ice probably won't help, i didn't ice mine, and the pain only lasts for maybe 15 seconds, its quick and easy<br>  not much to it<br>  after you get it done, clean it at least twice a day and don't take it out for the first few months<br>  be careful of yanking on it, that's what hurts the most<br>  healing takes about 3-4 months<br>  i payed 25 for mine, all together <br>  make sure you get it done at a professional place, i recommend a tattoo and piercing place, and make sure they don't re-use needles<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Ta6y5u0daa	On a scale of one to ten, my nose piercing hurt about a 7, but only for a second. The pain only lasts while their piercing it. You don't need to put ice on it, I doubt that would even help. It takes a long time for it to heal. I'd say several months. If you take it out before it heals, IT WILL close. I don't know if it will scar, because I've never let mine close. The price varies from place to place. Mine cost $50, including the jewelry. If you don't want to pay as much, buy your own jewelry.<br>  Chillax, it's not a big deal.|`|UC7K8vs9aa	Im thirteen i got my nose pierced. (It was a present for good grades) and i was in terror! I didnt want it at all i though it would hurt i was so close to passing out! (my dad was using the whole chicken reverse phycology thing though) but yeah its not bad at all i didnt hold ice and it stings like ear piercings maybe even easier it makes ur eyes water, not from pain its just like a involuntary response. But yeah its a 2 on the pain scale so easy and worth it!|`|HggrAEUJaa	well i just got my nose pierced and it didnt really hurt that bad. there was pressure and your eyes water but afterward its no big deal. you wont need any ice.<br>  oh and get it professionally done. if you or a friend does it you could hit a nerve and end up messing up your nose completely.

Where a cute white, light pink, light blkue, yellow, light green blouse that is tight at your upper waist and then flars out with a cute tie in the back. cap sleavs would be recomended. for shoes any pair of flip flops or flats would work. where your hair is relaxed curls or half up half down with light colored makup and clear lip gloss. brown eyeliner and light mascara would look nice for a spring day.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	If you want to run out and pick up some products locally, I recommend trying the following:<br>  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo<br>  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel<br>  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)<br>  <br>  These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

It work wonders ! I use this when I curl my hair and I want it to have that shiny, non frizzy look (: It's only about 3 to 5 bucks at Target . It smells great too . Use it when your hair is damp (: Put none or very very very very little on the top of your hair, you don't want it to look greasy ! If you don't have time to take a shower and use it, obviously use it when it's dry, just little less . Unless you want to get a spray bottle with cold water and spritz a little and put it all over your hair .<br>  <br>  Hope this helps .|`|au1yFfuxaa	For the dryness - mix mayo and eggs & apply it to your hair. Leave it on about 30 minutes. It will smell, I can promise you that, but it works so well. I have really thick hair that gets damaged easily also but this always works. Just make sure you shampoo it twice. And use deep conditioner. For the frizzyness, right when you get out of the shower towel dry your hair then use John Frieda frizz ease serum .

Then I found the Garnier Fructis products. Of course I use the type for curly hair, or frizzy unmanageable hair. I also use a deep conditioner every 3 weeks. My hair has gotten way more healthier, manageable, and very soft. <br>  <br>  For styling products, I use Garnier Curl Sculpting Gel, which helps control it. Also I use Catwalk for curls. I use the curl booster, and moisturizer the most. <br>  <br>  If Garnier shampoo and conditioner doesn't work for you (give it at least a month or two to see) try Catwalk shampoo and conditioner. <br>  <br>  What ever you do, never straiten your hair! It dries it out and causes more breakage. You could on the occasion, with a good quality straightener if you want to, but don't use it constantly.|`|h1OCYD7Gaa	I have very crazy frizzy wavy hair also.  I found that using an organic shampoo and conditioner has dramatically improved the texture and tamed my beast.  I started using LUSH shampoo bars and conditioners.  They are pricey (~10 per bar and 8 for conditioner) but each bar lasts about 2.5-3 months and the conditioner has lasted me about 4 months since you dont use a lot of it at a time.

Go for a walk at a fast pace for an hour 3 times a week and it should work out. If you give in once or twice its ok, start again. Its better to loose weight healthily over a long period of time than loose it too quickly over a short period of time... Good luck !|`|75mKdrMWaa	Maybe your doing the wrong exercises. some exercises helps you gain muscle, while others tone. Try doing cardio for 30 minutes and use light weights so you don't build muscle. As well, make sure you wait at least 3 hours after you work out before you eat. Make sure your on a healthy diet! No point in working out when you're eating junk all the time!|`|iLiD8MEKaa	You have to gain lean muscle. You'll still weigh more since muscle weighs more than fat, but you'll be leaner.

fGYbzEBvaa	I'm guessing you want a pencil eyeliner? I really like Urban Decay 24/7 eye pencil. It is pricey, but it is some good stuff. It lasts most of the day for me and it goes on creamy and smoothly. Some like Stila eyeliner, but I've never tried it, so I'm not sure. I also heard good things about the Makeup Forever one. I personally like the Urban Decay one better. Some MAC eyeliners are lovely too. (like the eye) If you're really good, try a liquid eyeliner. I also like gel/cream liners for the top. (MAC, Coastal Scents, L'oreal, Bobbi Brown, etc.)<br>  <br>  These are expensive for eyeliners, but they're really good quality!<br>  <br>  For cover up, I LOVE Make up Forever HD Liquid Foundation. It doesn't clog your pores and cover is great. I also like the MAC one and if your on a budget I would say Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse worked well for me.<br>  <br>  Lip Gloss- I love MAC lipglasses. Some say there sticky, but I don't think they are too sticky and they last SO long. It also has a nice vanilla scent and numerous amounts of great colors! Also, don't be afraid to try cheaper lipglosses, a lot of them are nice.<br>  <br>  Blush- NARS and MAC! I also like Benefit. Bobbi Brown is nice too. For cheaper blushes, I'd say NYX which you could find on cherryculture.com|`|1BF8UMjRaa	probably mac|`|Uid2v2SPaa	try www.thebodyshop.co.uk their make-up is amazing! They have the liquid eyeliners or the eye pencils, and there make-up is good for people with sensitive skin, plus all their products are environmentally friendly!|`|b3GZB3Wyaa	BENEFIT AND MAC.<br>  <br>  Benefit has a really nice, chunky pencil eyeliner called BAD GAL<br>  <br>  It's great!<br>  <br>  xx|`|G0ino2hjaa	Pure Minerals...<br>  And Mac!|`|s1MbGhpHaa	KOhL|`|tVK91lEwaa	I can help you here!  I'm part asian and have squinty eyes.  You can't even tell I have eyeshadow on unless I put it right below my eyebrows.  Because of this I had a difficult time with eyeliner because it would always end up rubbing off onto my eyeshadow area.  If your looking for ease of use, then a pencil is best, but it doesn't stay all day and it definately smudges!  I've tried every eyeliner out there the the best by far is Wet n' Wild H2O proof!  It's cheap, doesn't dry out like more expensive brands, (where it gets all clumpy in the bottle), and is only a buck or two!  Try it and you'll fall in love with it!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that it is a liquid liner, so use a steady hand, tighten your eyelid and keep your eye closed until it dries!  You'll need a good make up remover to take it off.  I hate to admit this, but I've worn the same eyeliner for 3 days, even though I shower daily, and it still looks perfect!<br>  <br>  I don't use liquid coverup, But I do have to say that the best foundation and cover up I've used is Bare Minerals.  You'll spend about $60-70 bucks on a starter kit that includes two shades of foundation, a tub called warmth for a blush or even an eyeshadow, and mineral veil.  Included is 3 brushes, one for detail work, another for larger areas like cheeks and forehead, and one for all over for the mineral veil or foundation.  It lasts you months and is great for your skin.  <br>  <br>  The best lip gloss is either from bath and body works, or satin lips from mary kay.  They hydrate without getting sticky and gummy and the bath and body works brand comes in a bunch of colors and flavors.  You can get a clear one that is minty and smells amazing.  It works great over your existing lipstick.
ZkrGttKaaa	$300 is a mite steep for that piece. I don't know any tattooists that couldn't knock that out in under an hour. I'd do that one for about a hundred. Color if you wanted it. Shop around some more. Tell 'em you're trying to find someone to do it for a C-note. ($100 bill) Somebody is bound to say yes.|`|AA11539936	Your tattoo isnt that big.

o4Xkp7WGaa	Truthfully I don't think you should get either. I like both of these piercings but like you I have that kind of "innocent" looking face. Although I like it b/c i can get away with more, I also hate it b/c there are some things that i really like that just don't look good on me. If I were you and were going to be getting a facial piercing i would go with a nose ring which i think would look great. If you are dead set on this though i would go with the left angelbite piercing.|`|rEWVy1Sraa	You have a lovely face and I think you should get both angel bites it would give your innocent face a naughty side.

eluLMSAraa	Not neccessarily, someone can have long thin hair. This is probably out of the question for you but i have a friend who has super thick luscious hair that grows like a weed (Shes Bolivian) and used to shave her head alot for a while and she told me that the more she shaved her head the thicker it got. But anyways, you should try mane n' tail shampoos which i have a thickening a effect. If you are just going for the thick look instead of it actually being thick you could tease your hair, braid it oveernight and take the braids out in the morning, or curl it. If worse comes to worse and you are really worried about your hair being thin consult a doctor. It may be something in your diet or lack of. Such as protein, if you are vegetarian then you are missing a lot of prottein because of the lack of meat so take protein pills or anything. Hope i helped!

The 1st mole I removed was gone in a matter of 5 days, the rest of them took no longer than 10 days to be completely removed.<br>  <br>  I recommend using Dermatend for several reasons...<br>  First of all it is all natural and contains only natural ingredients, I don't know how important that is to you, but to me it was very important. There are some products available that don't use natural ingredients, and instead use a harmful acid in their formula.<br>  <br>  Secondly it comes with a 100% guarantee, which if for some reason Dermatend doesn't work for you all you do is send back the unused portion. So you either get results and are satisfied, or you don't get results and still get your money back which is awesome.<br>  <br>  I bought Dermatend from <a href="http://www.mole-wartremoval.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mole-wartremoval.com</a> which is a web store powered by amazon.com, for me buying a great product from such a well known website just gave me more confidence about my purchase.

I would pick any shade close to green.<br>  Type/Color Shoes- Flats are my favorite. Wearing an eye popping color will make your dress really stand out.

OR.. wear a long neclace with alot of charms bunched up in the middle. (Forlove 21 or any other accesory store)<br>  Hair- Depends on the color and the occasion. I would do soft curls with bangs. But you could straighten you r hair and put a cute headband in it. Or just keep it straight.<br>  Maekup- I would use a soft tone... like gold. OR.. light blueish would look nice. Use blue eyeliner to enhance your eyes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.. Its what I would do :)|`|V6tPaXzxaa	I'd wear, either black, white or red cardigan for a touch of color.

You could have a garage sale of old toys and books and random things that are sitting in your basement. Ask your friends if you can borrow their clothes, as long as you return it clean and in the same condition. Also, you can find nice shoes for really cheap prices if you look in the right places. I always find flats and mocassins at Target for less than $5 a pair when they are on clearance. Besides that, they are always cute. Aeropostale also has great deals all the time, keep your eye out for coupons to use. If you have a birthday coming up, ask for money.

MARKETS!!!! great place to pick up relatively good pieces very cheaply.<br>  4. your outfit doesnt need to be brand new and stand out, trying jazzing things up a bit with some new accessories, accessories can breath a whole new life into an outfit.|`|boqwvEvUaa	your parents are so like mine ;) maybe your mom is afraid that if she gives you money, you'll 'waste' it. so prove to her that you know how to spend wisely 8D <br>  if you live in the states, try the juniors' clearance section in department stores like macys, dillards, jcpenney, etc. they have some really cute stuff on those racks for at least half the regular price. <br>  stores like Ross, Tjmaxx, and Marshalls have nice items and are seriously cheap. I found the cutest formal dress there for only $10!<br>  just ask your mom to take you on a shopping trip, and promise her you're not going to but ridiculously expensive stuff. plus, she owes you for taking the money you get from your grandma...<br>  btw, it's not all about brands or the price tag. trust me--i've always gotten compliments on my clothes, and none of them have ever been over $30 ;) well, except for a dress or two, but dresses are generally pricier.

The black-head actually gets its color from your skin pigment, lol... it isn't dirt. <br>  <br>  According to the pamphlet I got with the proactive stuff, it says that acne and black heads are actually do to your skin not being able to shed itself.

Do you have a Costco?|`|AA12167923	If you are prone to blackheads (due to large, open skin pores, which are usually more prominent on the nose), as I use to be, you should do a facial mask at least once a week - I did (and still do) a simple egg white facial mask. Take an egg and separate the yolk from the egg white. You use the egg white as a facial mask. It is excellent for removing blackheads. Just beat one egg white until it is frothy. Spread it all over your face. Wait until it dries and becomes hard. Rinse it off with warm water and finsih with cold water. Not only does it remove blackheads from your pores, it will tighten your pores and help prevent blackheads and other problems.<br>  <br>  If you have a particuraly bad case of blackheads, I would suggest that you get your blackheads removed regularly with the help of blackhead removal strips until you have conditioned your skin to help prevent blackheads.<br>  <br>  Also, using a face scrub on your nose daily (if that is the main problem area and it was mine) helps prevent the formation of blackheads and I use "Olay Smooth Skin Exfoliating Scrub with Gentle Microbeads". It is gentle enough to use every day for your whole face (not just the nose!) and I love the way it makes my skin feel. <br>  <br>  Using a good skin toner (and again, I recommend Olay) tighten pores temporarily, so make it a point to apply toner regularly, after cleansing until you have this problem under control. You should always wash your face with with warm water, not hot, and rinse with cold water which closes the pores.  I then apply Olay Complete Moisture Creme with UV Defense.  As you can probably tell, I am definitely an Olay fan; I have been using it for most of my life and wouldn't use any other product.<br>  <br>  I'm female by the way and I think I inherited my skin from my father and he always had terrible blackheads on his nose!  But I was in my later teens and early 20's when I had this problem and the above solution worked for me (oddly enough, I never had a lot of pimples, just blackheads on my nose and sometimes on my chin).  I no longer have large, open pores on my nose and blackheads have not been a problem for me since.|`|xUCXXb73aa	good facial maintenance every day,hot water and give them a squeeze|`|kxlmcG4gaa	Have a facial, it'll open up the pores.<br>  You could try blackhead strips as well, but they do get time.<br>  In the meantime make sure your drinking plenty of water and eating loads of fruit and veg.|`|yPKrBiIhaa	i went to get my eyebrows done and the woman there just scraped them off|`|u5nYlVMxaa	Squeeze them.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to do that, don't touch them! they'll only get worse.|`|iVferPLjaa	try Clearasil blackhead wipes  they really work for me.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.

Everyone's pain tolerance is different so there's no way to know how bad it'll feel to you.  I personally found it felt like a bee sting, and after the piercing itself it hardly hurt at all.

If you feel uncomfortable without a nose ring, then keep it! If not, do the opposite.
MMYY2cj9aa	Macy's!|`|2iAAczdyaa	My daughter had her Senior Ball in June. That is when all the prom dresses go on sale at 50-75% off. I bought her dress and was so happy I took her out to lunch at the mall where we got the dress. She has 5 dresses in her closet which she only wore once. Her younger sister can use any one of the 5. It is very common for women's groups to sell at considerable discount used  prom dresses and bridal dresses. A beautiful girl looks good in almost any dress.

rqP6zoxsaa	well when people see you, its kind of a bad impression because peircings on your lips are not supposed to be there. Maybe when you are older but i think its pretty discusting.

0vjBjkHvaa	ok. <br>  i highly suggest the first dress in blue for a few reasons. <br>  <br>  <br>  1. it is dreeier and looks better in blue <br>  2. with dark hair it would look much better with blue<br>  3. its cheaper. <br>  ;)<br>  <br>  but for a spring time dress i would suggest light to medium pastel colors. and orange ( i no its a very *wow* color) is very IN this season and would be perfect for a spring dance. so maybe look for one like that. but i deffinetly like the blue too. <br>  <br>  hope this helped! have fun at your dance! <br>  <br>  love fashion chica|`|R5TccYeAaa	Out of those pics..i like the 2nd one better.<br>  But why not look @ Deb's??<br>  I got my semi formal dress from there! <br>  <br>  The pic below is my dress..except mine is white and brown.<br>  <a href="http://www.debshops.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3426398&cp=3371585.3365393" rel="nofollow">http://www.debshops.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Heres some other cute ones<br>  <a href="http://www.debshops.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3426397&cp=3371585.3365393" rel="nofollow">http://www.debshops.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.debshops.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3426384&cp=3371585.3365393" rel="nofollow">http://www.debshops.com/product/index.js...</a>|`|Qbmv6eeYaa	i'm going to be honest, i'm not to crazy about those dresses.<br>  try this one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.americanapparel.net/rnt40.html#i" rel="nofollow">http://store.americanapparel.net/rnt40.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.americanapparel.net/rsa8348.html#i" rel="nofollow">http://store.americanapparel.net/rsa8348...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gojane.com/shop-by-category-formals.html?sorttype=1&size=0&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.gojane.com/shop-by-category-f...</a>|`|s5yZNq3iaa	<a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3020907?Category=&Search=True&SearchType=keywordsearch&keyword=dress+in+Juniors+BP.&origin=searchresults" rel="nofollow">http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3020907?Cate...</a><br>  <br>  This one is beautiful.

sZMa0s7Baa	Because it's easy to wear. There's no risk factor when pairing a t shirt that says ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH on it with a jean skirt and flip flops. Girls with absolutely no style will shop there.<br>  <br>  However, some of their flowy tank tops are really pretty, along with some of their jeans and flip flops. But I'm saying girls that shop there and Hollister relentlessly have no taste or originality.|`|B3uvhA7kaa	*Shrug* <br>  I don't know.<br>  <br>  It's super expensive.<br>  Everything shrinks when you wash it.<br>  Every piece of the clothing looks the same as the rest.<br>  They only have like five colors...

Six.<br>  I don't know, it sucks.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Unsubtle advertising telling you how 'cool' and 'popular' you will be if you wear their overpriced clothes.|`|RFCcWPliaa	No idea. I hate it.|`|gfEQbww0aa	Teenagers, especially girls, feel the need to fit in and be like everyone else. Stores like abercrombie and hollister, market to these demographics to make them seem like the only place to shop. They intentionally hire the cute, popular kids from high schools who are forced to wear their clothes to work and will also wear them to school. It's free advertising, put the most popular kids out in the public with "abercrombie" splayed across their chests, and everyone else will take notice.|`|xqljgDHmaa	It's like an epidemic. <br>  Somebody see's somebody with A&F, and they want it. Somebody else, does too. They call catch A&F fever, and buy sheer, tight, cheaply made clothing and admire each other for their unoriginality!<br>  Eureka!|`|XDH1dQmtaa	Commercials saying that if you wear this brand you'll be cool and popular. All the hott guys will like you and your life will be amazing. Thats if you can afford to buy 4 of the same $30 teeshirts because there so expensive.|`|Qbmv6eeYaa	because most people like to have brand name clothing, and seeing that most malls have and Abercrombie & Fitch, most people go there to get brand name clothing.|`|1wzSq4OJaa	They are not popular unless you are a misogynist frat boy, or some low self-esteem high school girl who is hooking up with said frat boys.|`|kW6vXLW3aa	everyone has different taste in clothes.<br>  but i guess some people think it's cool to <br>  waste money on what they see other<br>  people wearing.i guess it's called 'fashion'.|`|rs0leGv5aa	Because they have the cutest clothes ever!!|`|Vlafzl8yaa	don't know.i don't shop there.|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	its easy to match their stuff<br>  its pretty styleLESS though and cheaply made. I got a top from there for christmas and the buttons are already falling off|`|93CMl5tcaa	Not sure. But i hate it. The girls are all walking billboards.
xqljgDHmaa	Add on accessories is they key.<br>  Add a fun scarf to the jeans and tee look<br>  Find a vintage jacket at the thrift shop and layer that on.<br>  Find a cool hair pin or hat and put that on.<br>  Wear a flashy pair of shoes.<br>  <br>  Nobody is ever a poser if they enjoy the way they look. I would be profiled as the hippie-vintage girl, but I don't let judgements block my way to having fun!<br>  <br>  Buy things you LIKE, not things you think other people would, and wear them. Add in little things, bit by bit, and soon you'll notice that you don't just roll out of bed bored. You have options! You have SO many options you might even become late for school.....yikes!|`|i01egybJaa	You should add boho accessories to your outfits little by little. Like, you can still wear jeans but with a cute bohemian tunic.

I have neon orange cons and bright pink ones that I wear whenever I feel like it, basically. I only like how the high tops look under pants, but that's personal preference. If you think they look good with shorts or capris, go for it.

7RUqEJzLaa	Probably.|`|AA12285584	Definitely at Walmart. Also at Walgreen's and CVS!|`|L7f1MJjkaa	I got sun in and it SUCKED! <br>  <br>  but they have it @ Wal-Mart|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Try CVS|`|8cttUra2aa	dont do it. sun in can make your hair white or orange. use a better highlighting kit. they are super cheap at walgreens|`|4DSyEqTuaa	walgreens<br>  thts were ive seen it|`|4LCYQB4Iaa	yeah, walmart.. <br>  but also. sun in does work.. but<br>  <br>  if you put peroxide in your hair & go out side when it's hot or sunny..<br>  it'll lighten a bunch :]|`|nfQ041IHaa	Walmart has it. Or drug stores like Walgreens even|`|EaCkHmFPaa	Yeppp!<br>  Walmart!<br>  My Sis. Got Some From There!
L2izNBjoaa	I had the same problem. Its sad to say there is no healthy way to lighten it so soon after she dyed it.<br>  Wash it alot with strong shampoo, and don't use conditioner until its the shade you want it.|`|7200fae74a8ade04657651e82cebb5d2aa	If you dye it dark it might cover up the red, They sell "toners" in the store that reduce redness.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Buy a hair toner, one that will give you more cool tones.|`|giyYxbo1aa	Go back to the salon and ask them to tone it down for you as soon as possible|`|PonJcuecaa	This is crazy but the same exact thing happened to my mom today! and her hair is legit orange its sooo bright ! her friends who been a hairdresser for a reallly long time said to buy a natural based dye of either light ash brown or dark ash blonde! but dont buy anything with a green base because it will turn any blonde in your hair green! and put the color over the parts of your hair you dont like thats way to vibrant and youll be allset i had to do it for my mom!  Really hope i helped and hope your hair comes out to your likingg =]|`|75mKdrMWaa	I work at a salon. If you think your hair is too bright, go back tomorrow and tell them to put a toner on. They'll usually do this for free.|`|AB6SKMnKaa	It will probably fade any way.sorry, I can help you here. I'm not good with this stuff.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|uMxXbrDOaa	Dye it again.|`|7RUqEJzLaa	If you go to  a salon and get a blonde color and it's to bright then you can go back to the salon and tell the hair stylist that it isn't what you wanted. They will put a toner to darken the hair up. I know you can put toners in for blondes so maybe it can also go for red heads. Phone the salon and tell your hair stylist that it is to red and after you looked at it, it wasn't what you wanted at all and that you want to tone it down. It may cost money or it may be free.

LmDK1YNLaa	Ask this question at the salon. They know the strength of the bulbs in their tanning equipment and will be able to best answer this. <br>  <br>  Choose a stand up booth for the fastest tan. The beds take a long time.<br>  <br>  You need to buy eye protection-tanning goggles and tanning lotion for indoor tanning.

Yuck.<br>  I'd say just ask her. Explain to her that you've researched it and know the risks and how to take care of it. If she still won't let you because she thinks it looks bad or something like that, then you may have to wait until you're 18.
sWz9cDnyaa	just wear a bracelet or watch if you need to cover it up|`|80I1aHSGaa	You'll never know what people think every time. If you are truly concerned with what others will think, ( I personally think having a small tattoo would make that huge impression) I agree, just try to cover it with some jewelry or maybe some cosmetic cream.
27sSAeCqaa	Would you seriously actually consider wearing a wig instead of just altering your hairstyle a little? If you chose that route I could easily see how you could be come the biggest joke in high school (assuming that you are in fact in high school). Just get a different haircut. There are tons of awesome emo haircuts that would fit within the guidelines. <br>  <br>  Id say wear a hat but im guessing thats probably not allowed either. At least with a hat you could keep your pride and dignity.

V9oNKkDgaa	you can only die your hair darker with temporary color. (i.e. blondes going redhead,brunette, or black. or redheads going brunette or black).<br>  with black, you can't go darker, so to lighten it you have to lighten it permanently. however, if you give us pics of the color, we can tell you if it would look good on you so you could do it permanently.|`|XDCoZ0xvaa	use Bigen!|`|n5NfGo8haa	nope, cant do it .... theres no lifting  agent in any temporary color ,so the results on black wood be moot...

I'm in 9th grade, and I wouldn't avoid a guy I liked. If she's avoiding you, she doesn't think your good looking. If she looks away every time you're there, she doesn't like you.

Good luck!!!!|`|zO0CFFvCaa	When I like a boy, I actually do aviod him. I really don't know why. I'm pretty shy and outgoing around my friends, too.

1feDwHtBaa	The face that is narrow at the forehead and chin while being wide through the cheekbones is called diamond shaped. For this face, create fullness across the forehead and chin line and keep the hair close at the cheekbones. <br>  <br>  Hair styles for a diamond face needs to add width to the forehead and soften or disguise the cheekbones to give an illusion of the oval face. Add more fringe and volume to the forehead and the chin while smooth hair compliment the cheekbones better. A low side parting and a sweep of hair brushed across the forehead add width to the face and make it look shorter. Asymmetric haircuts look good too along with adding to the hair volume with curly or wavy styles.<br>  <br>  Hairstyles To Avoid: Try and avoid short hairstyles with height on top, particularly ones without bangs. Avoid styles that leave no hair on the neck area or the chin area. Middle parts will add length so they should also be avoided.|`|AA10480735	Don't get a face framed cut.

It actually could be that the perm your using is too harsh for your hair and that could be causing it to fall out. So you might want to try using a more gentle perm. Stress and health issues cause hair loss as well so you might want to look into that too. Whatever the case if your hair is falling out (not normal shedding that everyone hair does) then there is problem somewhere. Hair can start to break but it doesn't fall out just because you need a perm.|`|PtDQ46Tjaa	maybe depends

Sure, why not? ;]|`|NdkYyscYaa	yes you can but it wont be permanent|`|EkdNXDPjaa	don't do it. it only last for one day and looks liek **** for the rest of the week, not worth it.|`|VC5abHhsaa	I'm sure you can, but it would really hurt your hair. I wouldn't try it.|`|QPms7je0aa	yes, it lasts for about three days and depends on the color of your hair,  and oilyness... you need a light color|`|byVbvKseaa	i don't think so.
7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	It's probably the texturizer that's causing your hair to break. Do you know how to take care of your hair properly with the texturizer?  With your hair, once you put chemicals on it, you really have to be gentle with your hair. It would be a good idea to stop using the chemicals. Do you have your hair done professionally? How do you style your hair?You should use moisturizing shampoo, conditioner, and always use a leave-in conditioner. It would be a good idea to get your hair trimmed.

Dkk5HwbEaa	shave<br>  <br>  or you can buy a cream called Jolen, it will bleach it to a less noticeable blond.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, shaving does not make hair grow thicker or blacker.  It may make the hair feel thicker, since you've just chopped it off at a thick er part, rather than the thin, tapered end.<br>  <br>  There are also face creams that reduce the growth of hair, you can get these in the beauty aisle, or a good one from a dermatologist.<br>  <br>  Be sure to do a test patch with any bleaching cream, Nair or other chemicals, as you don't want a rash in place of your hair.|`|TM09z7teaa	Dont shave. thats for one. Use the nair for your face. its really easy to get a drug store.<br>  good luck :]|`|5wOyJ9DWaa	same with me , thread it at home <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F37Sl1c7BA0&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F37Sl1c7B...</a>|`|UuSmemr7aa	Waxing it helps alot.<br>  It's a good idea, and it only cost like $10 for the "kit"|`|asM2jBAjaa	ask cassie alfine

eluLMSAraa	Adriana Francesca Lima (born June 12, 1981[3]) is a Brazilian model best known as a Victoria's Secret Angel since 2000 and a spokesmodel for Maybelline cosmetics. At age 15, Lima finished first place in Ford's "Supermodel of Brazil" competition and took second place the following year in the Ford "Supermodel of the World" competition before signing with Elite Model Management in New York City.<br>  <br>  Modeling<br>  Lima never thought about being a model, although she had won many beauty pageants in elementary school.[4] However, she had a friend at school who wanted to enter a modeling contest and didn't want to enter alone, so Lima entered with her. Both sent in pictures, and the contest sponsor soon asked Lima to come out for the competition.[5] Soon after, at the age of 15, she entered and finished in first place in Ford's "Supermodel of Brazil" model search. She subsequently entered the 1996 Ford "Supermodel of the World" contest and finished in second place.[6] Three years later, Lima moved to New York City and signed with Elite Model Management. After acquiring representation, Lima's modeling portfolio quickly began to expand, and she appeared in numerous international editions of Vogue and Marie Claire. As a runway model, she has walked the catwalks for designers such as Vera Wang, Christian Lacroix, Emanuel Ungaro, Giorgio Armani, Fendi, Ralph Lauren and Valentino, among others. Lima became a GUESS? girl in 2000, appearing in that year's fall ad campaign. She also appeared in the book A Second Decade of Guess? Images.[7]<br>  <br>  Lima continued to build upon her portfolio, doing more print work for Maybelline, with whom she signed as a spokesmodel in 2003[8][9] and continues to work with, later appearing in the company's first calendar, along with Kemp Muhl, Jessica White, Julia Stegner, and Anna Wang.[10] The calendar is a limited edition release for the 2009 year.

She appeared only in shoes, diamonds and gloves for the November 2007 issue of Vanity Fair celebrating 20 years of supermodels with her fellow Angels.[15] Lima was chosen to be a part of People magazine's 100 most beautiful people in the world list, sharing that space with the Angels, with whom she also received a star on the Hollywood "Walk of Fame" prior to the 2007 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

"Sex is for after marriage," she explained. "They [men] have to respect that this is my choice. If there's no respect, that means they don't want me."[25] US GQ dubbed her as "The World's Most Voluptuous Virgin."[26] When she was younger, she studied to become a nun and often takes a Bible backstage to read.[27]<br>  <br>  She has been romantically linked to musician/singer Lenny Kravitz,[26] Prince Wenzeslaus of Liechtenstein,[17] and Denny of Timbalada.

9ybZ5kkeaa	Toothpaste usually dries them out and vapor rub makes them soft so you can pop them but since you've only got an hour, leave them alone. If you keep applying things or messing with your face it'll probably get worse. Just try to have a good attitude at the party and don't stress it. They're only pimples.|`|hcHvCGHMaa	thats happened to me. seriously, this works.<br>  <br>  ok <br>  1. take a glass of water and mix it with about 5 tablespoons of salt.<br>  2. take a cotton ball and make it damp with the salt water and then put the cotton ball on your pimples for 3-5 minutes. <br>  3. then, take the cotton ball and re-dip it in the salt water and put it on the side of your pimples.<br>  4. take a little bit of honey and put it on the pimples. <br>  <br>  seriously this works! but if you just wait until the top of the pimple dissolves, then it will come back in an hour. so hold it for the full time. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|bHdsvFqQaa	Show up and have a positive attitude anyways and people won't even notice.|`|QYW12oylaa	if you have any instant blemish control creams or lotions put them on asap if not try to dry your skin out so it goes down a bit. don't pick them whatever you do, this will cause it to redden or get worse, the concealer can also make it worse but if they still don't go away you may have to pop them :(
