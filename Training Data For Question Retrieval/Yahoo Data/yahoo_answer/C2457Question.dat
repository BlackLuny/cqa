UNITED STATES IN 1944   (JUSTIC HUGO BLACK)         ...[Detention] of those of Japanese origin was deemed necessary because of the presence of an unascertained [unknown] number of disloyal members of the group, most of whom we have no doubt were loyal to this country. It was because we could not reject the finding of the military authorities that it was impossible to bring about an immediate segregation of the disloyal from the loyal [that this was necessary]...   Compulsory [forced] exclusion of large groups of citizens from their home, except under circumstances of direct emergency...is inconsistent with our basic governmental institutions. But when...our shores are threatened by hostile forces, the power to protect must be commensurate [in balance] with the threatened danger...To cast this case [as one of]...racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which were presented...confuses the issue...                  FROM THE DISSENTING MINORITY SUPREME COURT OPINION IN KOREMATSU V.S. UNITED STATES IN 1944   (JUSTICE FRANK MURPHY)      ...We must accord great respect and consideration to the judgments of the military authorities who are on the scene and who have full knowledge of the military facts....At the same time...it is essential that there be definite limits to military discretion, especially where martial law has not been declared. Individuals must not be left impoverished of their constitutional rights on a plea of military necessity that has neither substance nor support.   In support of this blanket condemnation of all persons of Japanese descent...no reliable evidence is cited to show that [they] were generally disloyal, or had generally so conducted themselves in this area as to constitute a special menace to defense installations or war industries, or had otherwise, by their behavior, furnished reasonable ground for their exclusion....No adequate reason is given for the failure to treat these Japanese Americans on an individual basis by holding investigations and hearings to separate the loyal from the disloyal, as was done in the case of persons of German and Italian ancestry.

20090203161140AAtJpPQ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is it better to buy books or borrow them from a library?	I'm an avid reader and borrowing from the library can be a pain because I may forget the due date. At times, I don't have the time to renew my book if I haven't finished it because of school and work. Sometimes, my local library doesn't have the book I want and end up picking it up from a library across town. I put the book I want on hold on the libraries website which is also connected to other libraries.      And when I buy a book, it can be a little costly. But I always end up getting the book I want. I try ordering them online but the shipping and handling almost totals up to the price of a brand new book.       What should I do? Is it better to borrow a book from the library or buy a book?

20090203160424AAsM3UP	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Critique my monologue?	I'm auditioning for a high school production tomorrow. It's called SING! and the style is to really overact in a very broadway-esque manner. I edited a monologue I found online. My goal is to show a very wide spectrum of emotion. Can you suggest things to add in or take out?         I think I've just come up with the best theory. Teenage life sucks. That's it. I mean, once you hit 13, your life just goes (rocket). All the adults are like "Enjoy yourself. I loved being a teenager!" Ha, sure. Well, I'm sorry but this isn't "Sunshine 70's" anymore. They're just trying to make us feel better. And the little kids are like "I can't wait to be a teenager!” Haha, yes you can. You really can.    Okay, first of all, you're in Middle School when it all starts to happen. For some weird reason, it seems like when you're a teenager, all your friends start to turn on you. I mean, at first they're like "Hey, best friend!" and you know, you do the regular things like hang out and stuff. And then once you leave, they go around gossiping "Oh, my God Jessie told me that her friend Nathalie’s sister has this friend who saw Gretchen making out with Justin at movies... oh yeah, it was definitely tongue," (what expression) I don't even know a Justin! Then, there's puberty. Actually, I'm not even gonna get into that.    And then there's high school, the black-hole of all teenage life. Once you get there, everything starts to fall apart. There’s all this crazy drama. Everyone has that friend who’s just like “*Sob* Do you think he likes me? Why is he always hanging out with that dumb slut? You know what she did at the park? IS SHE PRETTIER THAN ME?!” And all through high school, it's nothing but college this or college that, and the college-councilors are not much help about it. 'You want fries with that?' (Sigh) Where was I? Oh yeah, life sucking. You know what, I'm tired of complaining. So, I just say two things to say: Adults, you're wrong, and kids, get ready.             THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH!   best answer---ten points!

20090203161429AAmkDrn	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	How to find meaning in life when there isn't any?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

I have an AP English writing assignment for homework tonight and I'm completely stuck on some of the things I must describe. Can someone give me some good examples?      I need help describing the following:      It’s All About Sex……Except Sex   “Scenes in which sex is coded rather than explicit can work at multiple levels and sometimes be more intense than literal depictions”. In other words, sex is often suggested with much more art and effort than it is described, and, if the author is doing his job, it reflects and creates theme or character. Choose a novel or movie in which sex is suggested, but not described, and discuss how the relationship is suggested and how this implication affects the theme or develops characterization.         Baptism   Explain a “baptism scene” from a significant literary work. How was the character different after the experience? Discuss         and Irony   Select an ironic literary work and explain the multivocal nature of the irony in the work.                  I'm lost with these three topics and I really need some help.

20090225064657AA5ydeJ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	REVISED: will you read a book (fiction) that changes writing style every few chapters?	okay, let's expound a little:      i was thinking maybe i could change the way the story is narrated.      for example, there would be really short chapters that have different narrators - points of view of the same events. these chapters would come at regular intervals.      then, there would be a change in the style of the general narrator (omniscient-omnipotent third person perspective), too. every few chapters, the way he tells the story would be different.      like, for example, i wrote short scenes and put them together in one chapter.      the story remains chronological but things happen at the same time, so the focus goes back and forth.      so the reader will get the full pictiure piece by piece.      then, other chapters will just tell what happens at it happens and shift focus only when it's done with the first one.      get it? ?   ======================================...   please help. :/

20090203160951AAFS5XR	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Painting	What is a hue version of a paint?	For example, if I was buying oil paints for a painting class, why would I choose or not choose for instance, Cobalt Blue over a Cobalt Blue Hue? I've noticed that at stores, usually the hues are cheaper. And wikipedia, for lack of not knowing where else to look, states that a hue is the same color, but with different ingredients (either cheaper or not toxic).       So, what's the deal with hue versions? Do they blend differently, have different drying colors, textures, etc? Can you give me an analogy if the wikipedia explanation is totally off as well please?

20090225071136AAG9KVW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How to use 'sound' and 'noise' in this kind of sentence?	I'm kinda confused to use one of both words in this sentence:      "Wait, hold on! I think I heard a sound/noise."      I know the meaning of both are different, but many references that I have read, use those two words interchangeably. I have already eliminated the use of "voice" as it usually refers to something made vocally from throats.      A friend of mine said that the use of 'noise' is much more common in horror or mystery novels to increase the thrill in it, so that way the readers won't assume that it might just be a wind crashing on the stone.
20090304181043AAvokPp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Opinion on really short story?	Hi there. It would be awesome if you could read this little snippet and tell me what you think, just please don't be too harsh as I'm not really a writer ( I'm rlly shy about sharing anything I write), I just wanted to try something new. :-)         “Leave me alone!” Sophie yelled.      “Now, now. Don’t play hard to get,” the man growled.         The two stood at the side of the road in the quiet suburb where Sophie lived. She was terrified by this strange man that she had run into just a few days ago. He stood in front of her with a crazed grin plastered on his angular face. Sophie didn’t know why she didn’t start running, maybe it was the fear that if she made a sudden move, he would pounce on her like an animal. He emitted a throaty chuckle  and moved closer to her as the chilly autumn wind blew back his messy black hair, revealing a jagged scar that ran down his left eye.    “P…Please don’t hurt me!” Sophie squeaked and stepped back. “As if saying that is really going to help,” she angrily told herself.      “I can’t promise that sweetheart,” he said with a laugh. He grabbed Sophie’s arm with a rough, dirty hand and pulled her closer to him. Sophie couldn’t let this happen without a fight, she had to get away. She yelled and sunk her teeth into his arm, causing him to loosen his grip on her just long enough for her to twist away.       “You’re a spunky one aren’t you?” he snapped.         In her haste to get away from him, Sophie stumbled into the street…right as a truck was quickly rumbling towards her. The man’s head jerked up and he saw the truck coming towards her. Sophie meanwhile turned to see the truck, but she couldn’t think could scream, couldn’t do anything. There wasn’t any more time. The man sighed before he lunged at her, grabbing her waist and pulling her away from the speeding truck. She fell back on the sidewalk hard. The last thing she saw before she passed out was a grinning face that hissed, “Stupid girl,” and as her eyes closed she could hear his maniacal laughter ringing in her ears.

I like   a drink   that brings   me cheer,   That's why   I like   to guzzle   beer.      It makes   me fun   to be   around,   Although   the burp's   an ugly   sound.   I'm mellow   when   I drink   a few,   And make   up poems,   one   or two.      I cannot   stand to   drink   light beer,   And vodka   puts   my mouth   in gear.   Gin makes   me want   to barf   my gut,   And rum   will put   me on   my butt.      Tequila   makes   my clothes    fall off,   Moonshine   wants to   make me   cough.   So many   I abstain   from fear,   I'll stick   with my   dark lager   beer.

20090304182532AAiTqKF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this sound like a good story?? JUST READ THE 1ST COUPLE OF SENTENCES?	I am writing a story (just for fun!! =]  )and i just wanted to know if this sounds good. Its about a dynamic character named Jessica. It begins with her being superficial/egotistic/fickle, Gorgeous on the outside; but VERY ugly on the inside. she uses ppl, and She is very full of herself, but it isn't until a series of horrible events that she changes and begins to become a new person. i want this to be an inspirational story. does this sound good?? would you read this??!!       U DON'T HAVE TO READ THE FOLLOWING. (ITS REALLY LONG) ITS JUST THE FIRST PART OF THE STORY!!!!!!!!         "Jessica, you will never guess who is staring over here.."   "Who?"   "Jack Trem!"   Not only is jack popular, smart, and kind, he is GORGEOUS. And he is looking our way.   "Why is he staring at us?"   "i don't know. But i think he likes you. His friends commented it to me."   I could just imagine us together. I mean so can everyone else. I was popular, and very attractive. Why wouldn't we be together? It was obvious that we were destined to be together.   "You should talk to him Jess"   "No Sharon! If he likes me then he will be the one to talk to me."   "sure. whatever you say."   Sometimes i think Sharon is jealous of me. Come to think of it a lot of people are. I have long flowing blond locks, and deep green eyes. I am tall, skinny, and tan. Well.. i am a couple of shades lighter than my current skin tone; I tan a lot. my natural hair color is dark brown, and so are my eyes. But i look so much better as a blond with green eyes and tan skin! I guess you can say i stand out from a group of girls. I can tell by the way all of the guys just look at me and ignore the others. I feel superior and above most girls. My confidence can intimidate most girls and even guys. Sharon wishes she could be me. She is pale, short, with shoulder length light brown hair. She is pretty, but she looks dull compared to me, as did a lot of other girls.    When i got to my calculus class, Mr. Bromergon called me up to his desk.   "Jessica, you know you have a D in my class?"   "Do i? Im sorry, but i have been so busy lately. I take my sister to ballet rehearsals, and then i go to the retirement homes to read to the elders. Im sorry i haven't turned in my work."   "Well thats great that you do all of that. But you really need to turn in all of your missing assignments."   Damn, my excuse wasn't working. I don't think he bought it. Oh well, time for plan B.   I was wearing a v-neck shirt that day so i stealthily pretended to "fix" my shirt. I pulled it a little lower. as i did this is said, "Well is there a due date for my missing assignments?"   "Let me check", he looked down and gave me a date.    4 days?! there was no way i could turn in everything that that short period of time.   I leaned in a little. He looked at my cleavage and blushed a little. I stayed a nice distance so he could get a good view. i peered down at the paper and  asked, "What are my missing assignments?"   He told me, "you have 8 assignments that need to be turned in."   "Ohhh. thats aayy lott of work." i pouted my lower lip just a little.   Mr. Bromergon blushed again and said, "well, i understand. I could give you an extension."   "Great!"   "I will extend it to 3 more days."   "Okay thank you so much." I said. I smiled and winked at him and turned to my seat. There were still kids coming in class. Then the bell rang and class began. Mr. Bromergon was a little flushed and stuttered as he was teaching. Samantha was sitting next to me and she gave me the notes after class was over. I had a free period next so i went to the library to copy the notes.    Agghh. this is too much work i thought. There was a geeky asian kid sitting in the table across from me doing his homework. Every now and then i caught him looking my way. He was nerdy looking with glasses and messy hair. He looked very devoted to his work, but it was aperant that i was a distraction to him.    Then i had a brilliant idea, I "broke" my pencil and walked to him to kindly ask for one. I asked him what he was working on and she shyly responded.    "Hey, you seem really smart. Do you think you can help me with my calculus!!??"    "Yeah, sure!" He looked so excited. I bet he would even do all of my work for me with a big smile on his face. and that is what he eventually ended up doing. The bell rang, and i gathered all of my things. I thanked him, smiled, and winked at him. He smiled back, and waved goodbye.    YES! 1/2 my homework was complete! This is so easy. I will just look for another nerdy kid to finish the other half. I walked to my BMW, dug the keys out of my Gucci purse and got into my car. I smelled the fresh interior and thought how much my parents loved me! I got it for my 16th birthday.    I drove home and walked into my room. my parents don't get home until 5. i had all the time in the world to myself. I got my laptop and checked my myspace. Jack Trem requested me! i couldn't believe it! I accepted and sent him a message. That was when we

20090304180248AAXhdtG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Characters from The Host?	Ok, I'm having trouble picturing some of Stephenie Meyer's characters in The Host. We all know that every person living in the caves is American, but they all have their own different backgrounds. There are a few I can't quite figure out. For example:      Lily- described as being caramel-skinned in color and athletic-looking. What is caramel-colored skin? I'm imagining it to look something like Jessica Alba's skin tone.      Wes- described as having olive-toned skin and black, bristly hair sticking up like steel wool. Several people say that he must be of Middle-Eastern descent and I agree.       Lucina is obviously African-American with her "thick lips and sleepy eyes". Her childrens' names (Isaiah and Freedom) also point in that direction.      Ian and Kyle are pale-skinned with thick, black hair. SM has already confirmed that they are Black Irish so there's no mystery there. Plus, the names Ian and Kyle O'Shea are about as Irish as you can get.      What do you think about the characters mentioned above? What do you think their descriptions say about their histories?

20090304182240AA8ZSxe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How do you like this story of mine? Do you think it's worth writing?	This story is about a 10 year old named Tiffany Dale. Past tense, fiction. This is my little sister's work. She is 10 as well.       ______________________________________...         Dear Diary,      Today I saw this totally cute guy at school. He has thick, wavy locks that are dark, dark brown. And his eyes are bluish greenish. He is also really cool. He is pretty new. He just transferred from California. Well, Gotta go! Mom made pasta. Bye!   Tiffany Jane Dale.      I closed my diary and scurried to the kitchen. The sweet smell of tomato sauce made my nostrils dance. I grinned happily as I sat down in my chair and started to chew on my pasta. "Tiffany, how was your day at school?" Tiffany's mother asked as she slid the second batch of pasta in the oven.   "Good." I replied. "Mom! How many times do I have to tell you not to put red peppers in the sauce?"   "Did you learn anything new?" Mom blabbered on, ignoring me completely.    I rolled my eyes and decided to pretend I was interested in what she had to say. "Uh, yeah actually. We learned about a few things in Fully Alive. Would you like me to put in a few details about how babies are made?" I asked, as if it were appropriate for the dinner table.   "Yes, plea- I mean, no thank you." Mom stuttered.    "Very well." I replied, pushing away my dinner. "I'm full. Maybe I won't be as full next time, when I insist you take the red peppers out." I growled.   Then I trudged up to my room. I plumped myself down onto my bed and shoved the book I was reading onto the floor, and its pages spread out like crushed wings.    I reached down to scratch my thigh. I pulled my suprisingly-wet fingers back up to see...blood!

In my mind when you died, you inherited special wings. those wings would sweep you across skies, pristine rivers. You lived to breath fresh air and flowers. I would spend my time in eternity laughing, eating the most beautiful food and clicking my fingers to welcome the magic.    When I closed my eyes I was there. Mostly, I would be dressed in white. I would share my experience with my friends and they would join me in going to that place.   It hit me suddenly when I was laying on the hospital bed. I was going to die. Excitement dwelled inside of me at the thought of it. I knew I would feel the sun's glow on my skin, I would taste the rain drops. The room turned silent as each voice moved to a distance. When I closed my eyes, I hurriedly tried to find the mountain top I had always seen, only to be greeted by walls

20090304184138AASeMlk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone else find these the best stories ever?	When I was to say my last goodbyes, I promised her so much, even the stars. Then I glanced into her eyes, I saw the stars shining. She looked back at me with a look of satisfaction. As our lips came in contact with one another, we realized that we were meant to be in this vast universe together. As I left to go to the war, she said "Wait!", I quicky looked back without hesitation as she held up a U.S Army Uniform with her name clearly written on the label. "You really thought you'd leave me without me to look out for you?". As I looked at her with astonishment, we both walked to the car and we drove off to war.   4 Months and 17 days went by, the girl I loved was gone, she was shot brutaly by the enemy. In her remains there was a gently folded letter. It read, "Dear Andrew, I want you to know even though I may die today in battle, I want you to know that I'll still be with you. I'm just visiting the star you promised to me."             NEXT STORY::::   As I was walking down the grassy pasture towards my bus, I saw a fluorescent light. The light seemed to call me, "Elizabeth, Elizabeth!", it would scream as I walked patiently towards it. When I finnaly reached my destination I looked into the gleaming light. In it I saw what seemed to be of a figure I have long forgotten of. "I miss you my sweet Elizabeth!", the voice would scream louder! I didn't know what to do! I asked the light, "What do you need?", I asked with quickly with terror in my voice. "Don't you remember me? I'm your nanny, the one who you would always cry to when the monsters under your bed would creep up slowly behind you.", the voice said. "Nanny Rose? Is that really you? Oh nanny I missed you so much! Why did you have to leave me i didn't even get to say goodbye!" I cried. "Oh sweet Elizabeth, I'm so proud of you, youv'e done so much with your life. But you have to promise me that you will make me proud even when "it" happens.", the voice said with haste. Before I could talk back the gleaming light left in the wink of an eye.    In 9 months after this experience, my mother and father were fighting with loud and angry voices. I was scared so I hid under my blankets for protection. My father ran upstairs with a belt he used to beat my brother with. I ran into my closet before he could see me. "Come out Elizabeth! I'm not going to hurt you I just need to talk to you, please believe me." As i heard my mother yelling over his shoulder, "No Elizabeth! Stay wherever you are, don't leave the spot you are in!" Could this be the "it" my nanny was telling to me? I assumed it must be! So i had a choice to make. Listen to my father or to my mother. As I sat in the closet I prayed to Jesus for the knowledge I need to know what to do at this tragic moment. I heard a voice in my ear, "Elizabeth, Listen to Jesus, he is the best friend you can ever have even better then me, your nanny." As I waited patiently Jesus told me to go tell my daddy to come to my location. I did without hesitation my daddy walked towards me with the squeeking of the floor boards beneath him. He looked at me with satisfaction as he picked me up and protected me from the last bullet my mother fired from her gun. Moments later the police arrvied taking my mother in custody. That night I looked up at the stars and wondered why Jesus took my family from me. As I waited there crying, I saw my nanny and father , "Were proud of you and we love you so dear." said my father. "You made the right choice Elizabeth, always count on Jesus to tell you whats right."

I'm reading some of Wordsworth's poetry and in, for instance, Tintern Abbey, he consistently connotes death as a positive experience.   He says, for instance, that death yields (and this is secularized, mind you) a sort-of eternal unification with nature. When he talks to his sister in Tintern Abbey, he again makes death a positive experience, this time in the form of the memories it allows.   Could you tell me how typical Romantics (earlier generation, preferably, like Wordsworth) viewed death, generally?

My sister really wants to finish reading it. It was a thick book about a dog (the dog's name is the title, but we don't know the name...) who makes a wizard angry, so the wizard shrinks him. He goes on this adventure to find the guy and reverse it, this dog goes to places like the moon and something like Atlantis (I think. I was really young then...).

20090304184243AAamd1E	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Comments and suggestions for my poetry?	The Final Breath   A poem about slavery    By, Kelsey M.      Though my past life was hard,   I never thought I could be scarred;   It all started with those men,   They said our kind wasn’t what it could’ve been.   The chief took their word,   Not listening to what was really heard.   Tantalized by new-worldly wonders,   The chief sold us while in our slumber.      Awaking to a violent pain,    Our efforts to fight were in vain.   Shackled to our nearest friends,   Most of which met their ends.   Separated from my sisters and brothers,   We never again saw our mothers.   Through that godforsaken Door,   On the deck of the ship, covered with the blood and gore,    From the many of my kind that came before.               It’s been God knows how long,   Why can’t our captors see that this is wretchedly wrong?   My neighbors have died,   Making more of a stench that cannot be described.   I’ve tried helping her, trying to create a stir,   What happened after the whip, that’s all just a blur.   They don’t care, even women and children, they do not spare.   We almost reach the land,   Unbeknownst to us, we shall become mere farmhands.      Again aroused from our only savior, dreams,   I wish the chief could only see now, nothing is as what it seems.   We aren’t even sold what’s worth our weight in gold,   Unimportant objects to satiate their greed,   No one thinks we deserve to be pitied.   I am now used, and far too much abused.      Today I have made one too many mistakes,   I can hear my body break.   He continues to beat me to the floor,    Nobody cares, they can always buy more.   Now I welcome the sweet embrace of death,   Now I can finally be free, letting go of my one…    last…    breath…         This was a Social Studies project, my teacher started crying and wanted me to publish it. Any thoughts?      Btw, I'm 13.

20090304191028AALX1vb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I am looking for a specific book.?	There is a book i read once, but it is kind of old, and I really need to know what it is. And I really don't need any answers like, "well go back to that library or whatever and find it!" because going back is impossible. Here is  a summary to the best of my memory:   There is a boy who is a slave on a place where they raise dragons. He cleans them and eventually, a mother is having a couple of eggs. He goes in and steals one. He takes it to this place with like a pond... and other things (remember this is in the middle of a desert with nothing but sand... I think it's defiantly sci-fi). He trains it and loves it and wants to battle with it so one of his friends sneaks him away on this truck with the dragon (who is I think a mustard yellow color) and goes to a battle place. On one of his other fights (not the one I just told about) his dragon gets hurt and opens his mouth as if about to scream... and they discover he is mute.                Some of the details may be wrong but I can't remember--oh and one last thing! They carry around sacks with their money on it around their neck and when they gain enough money they can buy their freedom. There is also a girl whose little bag is always empty but she says it's ok because in a way she's already free.      PLEASE! NO false answers!! if you don't know DON'T bother!!!! I am looking desperately for this book and i would REALLY appreciate the help :(
20090304201816AAJXueK	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Mental Retardation and Marriage?	Consider the hypothetical situation:  A mentally retarded person has the understanding(/reasoning/logic) similar to that of a 6 year old.  In other words, they view the world similar to how a young child would and cannot make many decisions on their own.      Should someone be allowed to marry this person?  The reason we don't allow people to marry children is because they are not yet able to understand fully what the situation is.  They may show signs of consent but do not fully understand what they are getting into.        How about very elderly people who might be in the same position?        Share your thoughts.

20090304195219AAqEBe5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How come no one ever checks the search bar before asking a question about Midnight Sun (Twilight)?	I've noticed that people will ask 2 or 3 times a day when Midnight Sun, the final book in the Twilight series, is going to be published. Or where they can find the first twelve chapters on the internet. To be brutally honest, this is getting very annoying.      So to anyone who is thinking about asking this question, a few tips:      - The search bar is a handy tool. It can direct you to resolved questions on any topic. Please use it.   - Stephenie Meyer stopped writing Midnight Sun, and says that the project is "on hold permanently" after the first twelve chapters were leaked. She knows who caused the leak but no, she has never named them publicly.   - Meyer has placed the first 12 chapters of Midnight Sun on her website, so that fans can read them. This is to compensate loyal fans of the series who were looking forward to the release of the fifth book.   - Many great books have been written that are not about Bella Swan and Edward Cullen. Consider reading something other than Twilight.      Thank you for listening.

The wind today sings a powerful song,    A classic love struck tragedy,    But this song has a twist.   There is no death, and no soul mates,    Just earth and sky, forever bonded.   They used to sing a song of joy,    Of good things sure to come,    But now disaster's struck this land,    And all that's sung is sad.   Disaster was the human race,    With blood stained hands, and dirtied souls,    We populate the land.

20090304190433AAQtMWT	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How can I hate the wonders that hurt me...?	...I have a form of autism and have been so hurt by someone so special, but, can not hate.  even though, that is what anyone would do in my place, normal.  But, is it so bad to always care and love...even though it hurts so much?  Sometimes I have to count or draw geometically, to help, but, when your heart is forsaken and thrown aside without a care when it's held so long...      how can I hate?  When that's what other's would do.  When I can't.

20090304190311AACPqWS	Arts & Humanities;History	What was the legality of the Cherokee Removal from Georgia?	Previous cases such as Worcester V Georgia and Johnson V McIntosh, gave sovereignty to the Cherokee Nation. What I am asking is how could the Cherokee be removed if it was already established law that they were an independent nation? I need to prove that the Government had the right to remove the Cherokee, it is for a Mock Trial. I need legal reasons, such as previous court cases.       Please I want someone who knows what they are talking about to give me an answer, and don't be shy about length. It is for a mock trial, and any and all information will help.

20090304195059AASB5XC	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you read this story?	I have always wondered why magic had rules so I longed to create a world where magic has no limitations. Things that happen in American history are really the works of powerful magicians. Like nuclear attacks, terrorism, miracles, etc. So my story is about a young girl that posses magical abilities but doesn't know it. Her parents are sort of the rulers of this magical unvierse and in order to protect her they've decided to keep her hidden. They created an entire world to hide her on in which everyone knows this girls real identity. And she's completely oblivious to it. The people she passes she thinks are strangers but some of them are really there to protect her and keep her in the dark. After her parents are killed by the man they were trying to protect her from the potential for her magical abilities is kindled. Her nemesis doesn't know she has any powers and thus ignores her existence. It is her responsibility to make sure that both worlds are saved from a nemesis she's sworn vengence against.

Or should I ask someone to tell me what happened in it?
20090304202353AAvpaQt	Arts & Humanities;History	How would you have handled the Vietnam War?	From my point of view, if it was in my hands, I would have bombed North Vietnam on a daily basis. I wouldn't care how much it cost, those B 52's would have been pounding the North 24/7 and the Ho Chi Minh trail. I feel like a ground campaign wouldn't have worked unless we were going to take over North Vietnam. If I was giving the order I  would have had a massive invasion from the beaches from Saigon all the way up to Hue. I would have started a massive ground campaign all the way to the western border line of vietnam than pushed up to the DMZ and the war would have been one in my opinion. But guessing the lack of experience our troops had and the terrain,climate and a new type of war fair, it was a 50-50 chance I guess. But we should have had a front line that kept pushing all the way to the DMZ.

20090304190641AAubKlS	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why are most people so consumed with discovering what is normal?	I am alarmed and amazed with how many people live their lives consumed with discovering what is normal! Don't most people know that normal is not like a hat size where "One size fits all". What is normal for me may be crazy or wicked for you.. and what is normal for you may put me to sleep. There are all types and it takes all types. When it comes to keeping up with your friends with jobs and kids. When what you do in the bedroom as a couple that works for you may be considered crazy, kinky or weird for others. So some people will not have the desire to go to college and this will seem so strange to those whose lives are all about higher learning. Some wont get jobs with responsibility. Some folks will seemingly bump along life not rely taking or leaving anything.       What is normal. Normal is being yourself. Normal is living happily. Normal is what you want it to be.

20090304194036AA5Gxeq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	One more story.........................…	There were only two more hours until I would be able to see Janet again. 2 years have passed since we have started to see each other. I loved to be with her. I loved her scent, the twinkle she had in her eyes every time I was to kiss her red velvet lips, the feeling of a fire going through me when she whispered in my ear, “I love you.” Tonight as well as seeing a movie, I was planning on proposing to her very casually, in the most unusual kind of way. I would put an engagement ring in the popcorn at the movie we would see tonight. Moments later I was to depart. As I arrived at her house I saw her open and close the door. She opened my car door saying, “Hey Drew, I missed you so much!” I told her I loved her more, and then we had that whole boyfriend - girlfriend love fight. When we finally entered the movie theatre we got popcorn and took our seats in the back row. As we sat there watching the movie I took the ring out of my pocket and placed it gently in the bag of popcorn. As she reached into the bag she grabbed the ring and said to me, “Drew, what is this?” I answered quickly, “Will you marry me?” As tears started to run down her silky white skin, she cried “Yes!”
20090304190206AAsOmEA	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Another story, is it good?	On a chilly summer night, a girl formally known as Lynda Williams was waiting patiently for her date. She would wait bye the door, constantly peeking out the window to see the shine of the boy’s headlights. As she waited, minutes flew. Lynda wondered if anything wrong had happened to her date. She thought to herself, “Maybe something is wrong, should I go look for him?” Lynda told her parents, “Mommy, Daddy. My date hasn’t arrived and he was supposed to be here 48 minutes ago. Can we go look do see if anything bad happened to him? I have a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach that something tragic has occurred.” Her father responded, “Nonsense dear, maybe he just forgot the date was tonight.” Her mother replied sharply, “Well anyway, we will go look for him Lynda, just in case.” As Lynda and her parents left there house in a hurry they heard the sounds of sirens off in the distance. “I hope that isn’t him!” Lynda remarked. Her and her mother quickly drove off into the sound. As they reached there destination, they saw a car that was as the engineer’s at the site called, “totaled”. The only words the mother and daughter heard were, “Emergency, Emergency! Calling all available cars! We have an injured man. Please send a chopper! QUICK!” As the two watched with astonishment and agony they saw the body being lifted out of the car. It was indeed Lynda’s boyfriend. Later that night, the incident was on local television. The boyfriend was obviously dead, but when he was in the hospital, the doctors would hear him say until his last breathe, “I cant be late, let me go, I need to ask her to marry me!”

20090304185657AAoQ6oF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do You Appreciate Fresh Voices in Fiction?	I have noticed that our literary world can be very repetitive, and this can grow weary to those who don't even notice it at first.     I am in the process of publishing three books, one is an adults, the second is a teens, and a childrens.  I have mixed up the genres rather well, like a science fiction/horror for example.  But, as many new authors are. I am growing more nervous as the deadlines approach for me, and I feel like I am using up too much time with worrying.  I just wanted to know if there are people out there that like weird and kooky stories, something out of the box.  Thanks for letting me hear about your opinions!   Cheers,   Sunny Adele

20090304201906AAAIVCO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story? (not a teen yet)?	Hey! I was just wondering what you thought of my story. I'm only 11 (just turned 11) and I love writing stories and wanna be an Author when I grow up. So... what do you think of this story?      “I don’t think this is a very good idea, Julia…”    My best friend and I were on the roof of my Aunt Poppy’s little brick house. I swung my legs back and forth as they dangled innocently off the brim of the roof. “Oh, come on, George! What’s the worst that could happen?” I replied, catching a glimpse of her nervous expression.    “We could fall off!” Georgia said, her voice cracked a little as she spluttered out the words.    “Aw, George! Don’t worry!” I told her, “Nothing’s gonna happen to us. Trust me, George. I’ve done this a million times!” I finished, smiling.    “I hope your right,” Georgia said, her eyes sweeping the grassy surface below us.    “Of course I am,” I muttered.    I really, truly didn’t want anything to happen to Georgia. She’d been my best friend ever since kindergarten. Oh, how I remember dreaded kindergarten… in kindergarten my arch enemy bit the heads off dolls. I thought it was pretty scary, actually. Now she’s the ‘Queen Bee’ of the popular clan. Ugh! Georgia and I had 2 friends that we hung around with at school. Eva and Hannah. Eva was very bubbly and never stopped chattering. And that was why we loved her. Hannah was extremely shy. She wouldn’t say boo to a goose! And that was why we loved her. I stayed with my Aunt Poppy every year. She was awesome! Aunt Poppy made the most softest, delicious, mouth-watering cookies ever invented! She worked at the local bakery here in Warrnambool. Aunt Poppy was 60 years old but she acted like a young adult. Well, she did to me at least.    “JULIA! WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?!”    I closed my eyes slowly and murmured, “Oh no…”    “JULIA!” Aunt Poppy yelled, she adjusted her glasses which were slipping off.    “YES, AUNT POPPY?” I yelled down to her. I certainly wasn’t allowed to plant myself on Aunt Poppy’s roof. And I just allowed my best friend to do it too.    “WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE, JULIA?” She yelled again, hoping I would hear her this time, “AND WHAT IS GEROGIA DOING UP THERE?”    “Uh… um…” I mumbled, shaking my head slowly. What was I going to tell her? I thought urgently.    Suddenly there was a creaking sound. I froze. My insides turned to jelly. I rotated my head slowly to the side where Georgia had once sat. I screamed. It was so loud that it hurt my ears. I’d never screamed this loud in my entire life. This scream couldn’t even compare to the time I’d almost slipped out of my chair on a rollercoaster.    Georgia was gone. Nowhere to be seen… she could be in outer space for all I know! I looked over the edge of the roof. I gasped in horror. Georgia was dangling off the edge of the roof, her fingers merely brushing against the brim. She looked… relaxed. I couldn’t believe my eyes! She just hung there, smiling. The smile was so calm that it looked scary. The way it was painted on her face. She looked like a porcelain doll. Georgia had always been inhumanely beautiful. The way her tanned skin blended in with her shoulder length curly brown hair. Her large blank brown eyes bored into my pale blue ones.    I shuddered. What was going on?! Apparently Aunt Poppy had been longing to know the answer to the same question because just then the magical words floated out of her lip-gloss coated lips. “WHAT’S GOING ON UP THERE, JULIA? I’D LIKE TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY, PLEASE!”    In a flash my hand was reaching out to help Georgia. And then my hand skimmed across the empty air. I looked to my right. Georgia was sitting exactly where she was before she’d been clinging onto dear life. “Huh?” Was all I could stutter out before Georgia’s ochre eyes were searching mine.    “Jules! What’s wrong?!” She gasped.    I stared into space, ignoring her. How could Georgia be dangling off a rooftop one minute completely at ease and suddenly appear mysteriously by my side the next? I shook my head, struggling to clear it.    “Jules?” Georgia’s hand was gently shaking my shoulder, “We better get down before your Aunt grounds us both for eternity,” Georgia laughed quietly, her hand sliding off my shoulder.     I snapped out of my trance and nodded weakly.    “We’re coming down now, Poppy. Don’t worry…” Georgia said loud enough for my Aunt’s hearing range.    Georgia led me to the chimney and slid down it delicately. I followed, my mind whirling. When I’d slid down Aunt Poppy’s chimney I found Georgia waiting for me. She was spotless. Not a single trace of dust covered her skin. While I stood there every centimetre of my body covered in a nice black coating. “What?” I gaped at her, “Why aren’t you dirty?”    “Why would I be dirty?” Georgia almost sang, a wide smile covered her face.    Her teeth were pure white; I’d never seen anything like it. She was surprisingly more beautiful than she was before she’d hung off the roof. Before she’d hung off the roof… I shuddered, forcing my mind to

20090304144234AAv5mwZ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Could I be a writer, story inside?	Im only 14 but i'd like to get some of my worked published, how would i go about doing this?   If your interested here is something i wrote last year, I must admit i keep improving though. Tell me what you think.      My bare feet sliding across the blistering sand. Waves crash ashore fading the bright sandy beach into mucky puddles. My graceful footwork slowly churns into heavy thriving steps. There is an incline of about 20 feet where a highway sits. I’ve passed twelve fast food places, six restaurants, 1 movie theater, several gift shops, and two hotels. One of which I head to now. All I want is to standstill, doze off into dreams that create grins and giggles. The only thing that’s pulling my body toward the hotel is the cramps folding within my stomach. With every step my chest heaves and my belly groans.       I slump up the steps that lead to the double doors. I put on an act as soon as my feet dissolve onto the polished tiles. I can feel the ladies eyes follow my figure to the elevators. They’re all wearing tight neutral colored skirts followed by panty hose that blends with their skin tones. I press the circular button that displays an up arrow in a cursive font . The light above the elevator flashes red, I slowly crawl into the doorway and press floor 24 (the biggest number of the bunch).        I fought my mind, going over week’s worth of memory. They forced me to leave I had no choice! No one believed me, well of course they didn’t I was up against an adult and in the end losing. After minutes they made up their minds so I just sort of left. Henderson’s School For Girls, worst days of my life but the worst was April 13th.       I started my routes, my head jerking back and forth as I slowly walked through the isles. I quickly came to a halt when I saw a glare. I back traced my steps to find myself at a silver tray sitting outside the room 1846. I handled the tray like gold as I drifted off to the “Exit” sign at the end of the hall. I adjusted my elbow to push down the handle, and then wedged the door open with my shoulder.      While my body was in deep pain it never failed me. I slowly walked to the grey plastic steps, the kind if you ran down a huge, loud echo would follow. Surprisingly, besides the fact I was on the top floor there lay another flight of stairs, the last set, so I walked once more. As I made my way, step by step, I just thought of that night when it happened.
