Now find your crawl space access door and rent or buy a high volume blower to set in the opening. Plug in fan and start blowing air under the crawl space.<br>  Now check your downspouts around the house and extend them out 4-5' away from your house. Look at the level of the ground around your house. Does the dirt slope away from your house, or is your house actually the lowest area in your yard?<br>  Just one or two downspouts that aren't extended out far enough can dump a lot of water up close to your foundation/crawl space.<br>  If you have standing water in your crawl space - you need to have someone come out and give you an estimate for installing a pipe trench drain system and a sump pump for your crawl space. <br>  Also make sure your clothes dryer is not vented into your crawl space.<br>  Call a Contractor and watch out for these special " Crawl space Contractors, they can be 2-3 times as much as just a good general contractor.<br>  Good Luck|`|i2soHittaa	Sure- put a vapor barrier to 'cover' up the moisture and most likely, water-period.

It worked really good. I don't remember what it was named or where I bought it.<br>   Just letting you know that it is out there|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	You have already received the correct answer.  My only caution is make sure you let the inside dry (or use a hair dryer) before you install the liner.

AA11759897	You haven't said if the cottage is a stand alone or a terrace in a Village or some other location. Part of the problem may be the very wet summer that we had but if you can reduce the ground level around the property this may well help. Over the years the land will have been on the move and as small as it may be the land will lift if it comes against an immovable object (the cottage ) take a close look at the levels inside and outside. I question the retaining wall 10 mt. (30 ft.)  that's way higher than a 2 story house inc. roof.  <br>  You could always try a plastic land drain system from the back and around the sides and then let it exit further down the hill side.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck but it should be curable. <br>  It won't have be like that since the day it was built.|`|AA12231462	I lived in Burnley for a while same problem no possibility of puttin in a dpf so you use render either mixed 1-1 s/c or with a dampproofing additive and their recommendations for the mix. do one scratch coat and be sure not to scratch right the way back to the stone - just enough scratch to give you a key . Take the render at least a foot higher than the damp rises. Then get a second coat as soon as you can get back on it - if you leave it too long - the first one will be rock hard and you r second coat will end up sliding on the floor. The additive makes it a bit like smearing melted cheese around but it works. You need also to not have the rendering touching a screed floor at the bottom end so it needs to be cut away when still soft.<br>  <br>  This worked on the stone cottages in Burnley - also make sure that if you have a screed floor that you have a dpm in place otherwise that will wick damp up your walls|`|c097c1011041fad908830a01a920f94aaa	when water hits a retaining wall it either goes`s around or under it ...as a builder in uk i see lots like this ..cannot see a natural solution to this ..the floor and the rear wall need tanking ...modern tanking methods are brilliant ..i use a firm called peter cox ...|`|J0jCZ3REaa	Lift flooring where damp problems are occurring towards possible drainage point, install drainage channels using local hard stone impervious to water similar to french drain, but allowing water to flow underneath.

8q82dLS8aa	It depends on what your buying<br>  <br>  some of it's good and some of it is kind of crappy<br>  <br>  this desk i got there once, for example, was made of a really soft wood and now every time I write anything it ingrains it in my desk >_<|`|1hciyvKdaa	I like Ikea, I buy all my stuff in their discount area, meaning someone built it, didnt like it or it got a scratch or something, I bought over 250.00s worth of kitchen table and matching end table for 80.00! They both are with leafs that you twist and turn and fold to compact or extend, I love them! They even build furtniture brand new and put in there. Building your own, is tough, instructions for any furniture you have to build yourself is torture for the most part, they do though, have a wall unit with lots of extra bolts and nuts etc, stock up on a few of each so you dont have to go twice, I do recommend checking that prebuilt area, It took me 6 months, to find the matching table and I bought the matching chairs one by one, I only needed two and live alone so it was fine for me to wait, the chairs I got for like 8 instead of the 25 each! I love shopping there when I am bored, they have the greatest picture frame selection also!! I bought my comforter there too, and some cool low voltage lighting. If you pay using your debit card instead of credit, on the bottom of the reciept they give you a coupon for your next visit as a dicount, its not much but they do add up if you shop there often enough. So I would give it a ten out of ten. *they do have referals for people who will come out and build stuff, its not cheap but. I would also do some reading online of wood furniture building and possibly use wood glue and then do the nails etc provided for a more permanent build on some items too. Prebuild furniture from other stores use both, glue and nails, or screws etc, but at IKEA its nails only on the instructions.|`|8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	I am sitting at an Ikea desk right now, with Ikea office furniture.  You must assemble it yourself, which requires some serious work, but by doing so you save a lot of money.<br>  I love my Ikea items, they are good quality and look nice.  Plus, you can buy a bag of those frozen swedish meatballs with meatball gravy sauce when you go there.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	We have several pieces of Ikea furniture. How easy it is to put together depends on the type of item it is. A dining table and chair set is easy, just screw in the legs and you are done. Anything with multiple drawers is going to be very time consuming because of all the moving parts.<br>  <br>  Of course the furniture isn't going to be as good as something from a catalog that costs ten times as much. Ikea is fine if you are moving out on your own and need some basic furniture to tide you over before you can afford to invest in quality pieces. The main concern with cheap furniture is how well it will handle moving: cheap furniture tends to fall apart during moves, not necessarily from everyday use. But you never know: my family had a cheap desk and bookshelf (much lower quality than Ikea) dating back to sometime in the 80s, that survived several moves before they both fell apart a few years ago.<br>  <br>  Ikea furniture does not come with written instructions. It only comes with pictures showing how the parts go together. Some people may find this hard to follow.<br>  <br>  Also, the furniture is designed to pack into boxes efficiently. This is fine for dressers and bookshelves, but the couches there are really bad (in my opinion).<br>  <br>  Ikea also has much more than furniture. They have some good looking and economical rugs, linens, bakeware/cookware, wall art, and more.|`|jN8duTx2aa	I've bought several pieces there and I find their quality to be much better than similarly priced places like Target and Wal-Mart.<br>  <br>  A dresser is a little tricky because there is a lot to assemble.  If it falls apart, the problem is most likely how you put it together rather than Ikea.  So take your time and don't cut any corners.|`|UhXTWNKZaa	Remember ALL of the things in ikea you must assemble your self<br>  it might fall apart if you dont put it together right|`|LF4Gwnroaa	Hiya<br>  I have bought many things over the years both in London and in Barcelona and I have never had any problem with any of the stuff.

BUT, be sure that your toilet DOES FLUSH properly, every time, with whatever amount of reduced water you choose (size of closed bottle) to set. AND be sure to locate the bottle in the tank so that it does not interfere with the proper opening and closing operation of the flush bulb.|`|hWdSTmfDaa	you can just adjust the float which regulates how much water enters tank. understand though, the less water in the tank, the less of a flush you will have.|`|AA11758665	yep lots easier then adjusting the float but if you displace to much water your toilet wont flush.
FlsrXuJOaa	I agree with the above poster that the moss should be removed and the soil thoroughly raked to stir it up. The best kind of grass for your area definitely depends on where you live. In most of the country, so-called cool weather grasses like bluegrass and fescue are the best. For a shady area, fescue would probably be your best bet, though Thermal bluegrass works well in shade and is unbeatable in it's attractiveness. <br>  <br>  If you choose fescue, seed at a rate of 1.5 lbs per 100 square feet. I would seed your area VERY heavily, considering your area will be completely bare, you want to get really good coverage so that your grass will be thick enough to choke out weeds. Fescue is a clump-type grass, so you want to get the seeds close together so the clumps will form an even, thick carpet. <br>  <br>  If you use bluegrass, you don't have to seed nearly as heavily because bluegrass seeds are way smaller than fescue seeds. Also, bluegrass has rhizomes, meaning roots that spread, so it will form a thick carpet easier than fescue. <br>  <br>  Secondly, i would put on a top dressing of a product called Turface. It is hard-baked clay chips that will keep the seed from washing away and it also holds the moisture in, which helps the grass germinate. The grass will grow right up through the turface and you won't even know it's there. Also use a starter fertilizer. Whatever your local garden center sells is probably adequate. <br>  <br>  Water water water! You need to keep the seed as moist as possible while it is germinating. Water your area twice a day for 5-10 minutes. Fescue germinates in 5-10 days depending on the night temps (50 or above it will germinate quicker). Bluegrass takes longer, up to 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that since you stirred up the soil with a rake, that is stirring up a lot of dormant weed seeds, so you might get a lot of weeds coming up while your grass is germinating. You won't be able to spray anything on the weeds until the grass is up and you have mowed it a couple of times. Then you can use any broadleaf weed killer to treat for weeds. Hope this helped!|`|fNuMoHt7aa	for that small of an area i would remove the moss and lay down sod.|`|T4uZeVXjaa	Grass, even so called "shade mix" needs at least 6 hours of direct sun daily.  Trying to grow grass in the shade is very difficult.<br>  <br>  Grass and moss like exactly the opposite growing conditions.  Grass likes deep, fertile, well drained, neutral to alkaline, soil in full sun.  Moss likes shallow, infertile, moist, poorly drained, acid soil in shade.  If moss is growing well and there is no natural grass, it means the conditions are right for moss and wrong for grass.<br>  <br>  You will need to reduce shade by removing or limbing up trees and shrubs, and improve the soil by adding compost or topsoil before attempting to grow grass.<br>  <br>  Starting a lawn from seed is tricky.  For such a small area, lay sod once you have added soil and removed shade creating trees.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	The ground has to be thoroughly prepared for growing the grass. Moss and any other weeds have to be removed. Dhoob grass is the best for the lawns. Work in some good organic manure in  it before putting down the grass. Good luck.
XKkx6Z6Uaa	I don't recommend removing the veneer. Normally a veneer covers chipboard which has a rough texture and not a good finish for painting.<br>  <br>  I suggest you rub down the area of the chest that has bubbled slightly and then prime with a suitable primer. Make sure the primer can handle varnishes, veneers etc. Your local paint shop should be able to advise you on the brand, but there are various. <br>  <br>  I would then build up with layers of acrylic paint in your chosen colour (eggshell is good as it is fairly tough). Being acrylic it will dry quicker than gloss paint which is usually oil based and takes longer to dry, meaning you will be able to apply more coats and is much easier to use.<br>  <br>  To finish off apply a coat or two of acrylic polyurethane varnish to protect the paint from scratches.<br>  <br>  Should get a top pro finish this way.Good luck.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	It's probably pretty ugly under the veneer, and may not even be paint-grade. If you're okay with the chips, just sand the whole think lightly, prime it, and paint it.|`|AA12233727	Don't bother removing the veneer unless it's about to come off any way. You don't need to strip it either. Sand the piece to smooth out the bubbles and chips then prime and paint it. Check at the paint store to get the right kind of paint , it will make all the difference. I would also consider a satin finish because it will go better with the white washed furniture, if they are all for the same room.<br>  <br>  To white wash the tables you will only have to strip them if you think the current color is too dark for the result your trying to get. White wash is latex paint thinned with water, then brushed on and wiped off with a rag. Since you are doing a table and chairs,I would seal them with non-yellowing polyurethane in a satin finish.

KHtPan4Jaa	yes, a specific tool that is designed to remove debris from threads would work here. However, wicket is right that needle nose plyers can do the same job. I have used needle nose plyers in a similar case, and it worked fine.<br>  <br>  If you can't grab the broken part of the shower pipe with the plyers, put the plyers into the centre of the hole, and open them so they're pressed against the sides of the fitting.

Basically you insert the appropriate wrench, looks like a fluted shaft with a off set wheel that cams out when turned, into the broken pipe and then put a large wrench on the shaft and turn out the pipe. The other option is a pipe easy out, you pound the appropriate size easy out into the pipe and again use the wrench.

It is a personal choice whether you wash socks everyday. You wouldn't wear your underpants twice would you.<br>  I wash all socks everyday and I buy ones that can take continual washing.  When you think about it our feet do a lot for us in the course of the day.  Everyone suffers from some sort of foot disorder over their life time corns, in-grown toenails, fungus, athlete's foot, sores, etc.  Your feet can sweat, get clammy, smelly.  We do abuse our feet by putting them in shoes that are too small or tight or high or poorly made.  Our feet never see the light of day sometimes, socks during the day bed socks at night.

If acetone won't lift it, it's probably an oil based paint, and you'll have to resort to mineral spirits, which will more than likely fade the color quite a bit.  If it's epoxy or poly amide paint, you're pretty much out of luck.

They should be marked, <br>  but often aren't.).<br>  Sorry, This is easy to do hands on, but hard to describe. <br>  I think I've given you enough to figure out what you've got.<br>  Do remember that if the wire is connected to the wrong <br>  terminal on a good three way switch it becomes <br>  a one way switch.<br>  That might be what you've got.|`|hWdSTmfDaa	<a href="http://www.leviton.com/OA_HTML/ibeCCtpSctDspRte.jsp?section=23948&minisite=10026#Occupancy_Sensors" rel="nofollow">http://www.leviton.com/OA_HTML/ibeCCtpSc...</a><br>  the wiring looks correct. make sure the two wires (travelers) are independent between the switches. hope link helps.|`|c4999086fee89f42c2ecc09a87b3405faa	This one should get you on the road running.|`|C93lTJozaa	youu tube has what your looking for It make it easy  ,|`|VUNTunxiaa	The wiring diagram you show is not correct; it has both conductors routed through switches before they reach the light.<br>  <br>  With any lighting installation, the grounded (neutral) conductor does not get switched (there are specific NEC rules dealing with when, and only when, you may "switch" the neutral.<br>  <br>  If the switches as installed were not functioning correctly, the wiring was wrong from the beginning. Somewhere a traveler got placed on the wrong terminal. The instruction diagram on any 3-way switch will show the correct wiring scheme; just follow the instructions, if both switches do not operate correctly. Then you have to use the S.W.A.G. method of trouble shooting, and start by changing the terminals, on first one switch and then the other. Use different colored phase tape to identify the conductors while you are doing this, and keep a written record of what terminal what color was on. When completed, re-identify the conductors using phase tape, but not white (or gray). Reserve that for the neutral conductor.<br>  <br>  One final thought; if the darker line on the diagram represents the neutral, it may simply be shown to be passing through the switch box (generally a lighter color, or an interruption of the line - with an "N" in place will indicate the neutral). If that is the case, the diagram is a bad one, but is correct.<br>  <br>  Last thought on the matter: are both switches 3-ways? If you are using a single pole at one end of the switching circuit, it will never work, the same applies to using a 3-way and a 4-way together without a second 3-way on the circuit.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry; I should have pulled out my Leviton Catalog first. Apparently, these occupancy sensors are designed to be used as either single-pole, or 3-way sensors.<br>  <br>  That leaves three choices. 1: The travelers are mixed up. 2: The sensors are set up so that their "field of vision" either overlaps too much, or one of them is not focused on the area required to activate it. 3: The switches were changed out for the occupancy sensors without opening the circuit breaker, and the current surged while the connections were being made and blew the internal electronics of the sensors.|`|CM3Fl3WRaa	Wiring diagram from leviton: <a href="http://www.tamtech.com/userfiles/Leviton%20Motion%20Detector%20Specs.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tamtech.com/userfiles/Leviton...</a>|`|fNuMoHt7aa	check this out.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askmehelpdesk.com/advice/t-21225.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askmehelpdesk.com/advice/t-21...</a>|`|OrG2fBbKaa	The wiring diagram is close, but I suspect switch 1 also needs a neutral reference so it can work.

The answer is yes, but it doesn't work as well.  If you have nothing else then go ahead or use dish washing liquid.  The real secret is how hot is the water you are using(never use cold water to wash your car) and you must always rinse the car first.  If you don't rinse the car before you soap it then rub the sponge or cloth into the paint work you are rubbing in dirt or tar or bird poo, etc. Bad for the paint work. You do know that hair shampoo doesn't have quite as many cutting agents as car shampoo.  Hair shampoo is gentle, car shampoo is harsh.  In a nutshell hair shampoo doesn't clean as efficiently as car shampoo and you can't damage the paint work unless it is old, cracked, flaking or rusty.

alIO8ic0aa	Jadite was manufactured by many companies from the 1930's to 1972. Jadite is occasionally referred to as "clambroth" a term also used for opaque white glass. Each company produced a slight variant either lighter or darker of jadite's basic seafoam -green color. It's made of low expansion borosilicate glass and is ideal for oven use<br>  <br>  Jadite was heavy, durable, inexpensive and, sometimes it was even free. It was often packaged as a giveaway in food and cleaning products. Restaurants served meals on jadite dishes, as they cost pennies to buy and had a high threshold for breakage. <br>  <br>  Because Jadite is functional, good looking, and easy to find and still fairly cheap to buy, it is an ideal collectible. <br>  <br>  What makes jadite especially fun to collect is the hundreds of different items available. There is everything from basic tableware and kitchenware to unusual, even quirky, things like cigarette boxes, footed bulb bowls, jucie-saver pie plates, door knobs and water dispensers to name a few.<br>  <br>  By far the largest and most well-known producer of jadite was the Anchor Hocking Glass Co. was founded by Isaac J. Collins, in 1905, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to produce pressed-glass dinnerware.<br>  <br>  After Hockings merged with the Anchor Cap Co in 1937, the new company, the Anchor Hocking Glass Corporation, started to manufacturer glass ovenware that could endure high oven temperatures. Their wildly successful line of ovenproof glass, called Fire-King, debuted in 1942 and was made for 30 years. Offered in a variety colors, Fire-King named their opaque green color Jade - ite which would become the line's most popular color.<br>  <br>  Alice: With a delicately embossed floral pattern, this is the oldest Fire King style. It came out in the early 1940's and only cups, saucers and dinner plates were made. The cup and saucers, which are much more plentiful than the plates, were given away with Quaker Oats crystal Wedding Oats, while the plates were a move goer's premium.<br>  <br>  Charm: Anchor-Hockings made this square Fire-King Pattern from 1950 to 1954. It is the hardest Jade-ite style to locate. <br>  <br>  Restaurant Ware. Produced from 1950 to 1956 is the most well-known jadite pattern, and many collectors buy only this. It is a clean simplistic pattern, once used in diners all over the country, and was advertised as :Mass Feeding Establishments". It was sold in five and dimes, it was produced in a wide variety of tableware objects, including partitioned plates and different sized cup, mugs and bowls. The thick lipped coffee cups were known as "cheater mugs" by using these cups, restarants could save about an ounce of coffee.<br>  <br>  These are just a few of the designs available for collectors, others were Jan Ray and Swirl.<br>  <br>  Except for rare items, Jadite is fairly abundant. You will be able to find it easily when searching garage sales, flea markets , online auctions etc. Before you buy , research the Jadite , notice what it looks like , and how it is marked on the bottom. There are a great deal of duplicate or new jadite being passed off for the vintage. So beware.

AA11305474	Acrylic.  Rayon has a tendency to lose its body (stiffness) over time and you have to add sizing back to it.  That is because it is made of combination fibers, synthetic and natural.  The natural fibers stretch with use and laundering and that causes the garment to lose its shape.  It is also a less dense fabric than synthetic acrylic so it wears better, longer.  All that being said, because rayon does have natural fibers as a component, it tends to breathe which makes it a more comfortable fabric to wear in the heat and not as warm as acyrlic in the cold weather.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Acrylic is more durable, but rayon is far more comfortable.|`|2053590a4063a57bf6f2e1e1d08781a7aa	Try a polyester/cotton blend.

W4BvABL6aa	Your best bet is to go to the county or city building inspections and zonning for information. They should have printed hand outs with guidlines. Possible a web site might do the same.

8apA3Rffaa	Tile is a good value and bang for the buck.  But I ll give you a money saving tip.... Go with a wood edge molding instead of a tile type trim.  These trims can be any where from 4/6 $ a pc...I ll catch flack from people who think they know, but porcelains are over rated and sold.. Don t get me wrong, they are a good tile.  But don t go looking just for porcelains..Any class 3or 4 tile w/ an ohm rating of 6/7 or higher is just as good as any porcelain.. These are equal in pricing also.  Porcelains got there "rating" because they used to be color thru the body , which when chipped,you don t see the body of the tile... No  longer are the majority of porcelains,  they are a glazed  porcelain for the most part now.  You ll get the most value and return on the investment , if you properly do it yourself. ..Any questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and check my qualifications there  GL|`|AA10097817	Porcelain tiles gives you the most quality for the dollar.

I am not a bunny hugger or anything, but a lot of people really like the concrete counter tops and they are only a little more than tile.<br>  For example if:  Granite - $ 1000<br>                          Concrete - $ 750<br>                          Tile - $ 600<br>                          Laminate - $ 400<br>                          Prefab - $ 250<br>  They are as durable as tile, good for the environment and your budget.(when it comes to resale). However, if you just love the look of tile, I would go to a tile whole sale. Or find a discontinued line from wherever (Home depot or Lowe's, ect...) just be sure to buy a few extra. I have picked up marble this way for $1 sq ft, so I know it works it just takes patients. Porcelain tile is the best for the buck. Hope this helps.

Good Luck and Enjoy your new kitchen.|`|mWkkh9L7aa	I agree with Rob S with one exception, wood trim.  Wood expands and contracts causing the grout to break loose.  It should be caulked where the tile meets wood (plus where the splash meets the counter top) and it will help.  Caulk is somewhat of a dirt catcher, so you will be aggravated; but it does save money.  When we tile countertops and the homeowner opts for wood trim, we exclude it from our warranty (in writing).  <br>  I would also suggest using 12" or 13" tile because it is a nice update and will add value to your condo.  The old 4" or 6" tiles are not used much these days.

If the furnace knows it's not working correctly, it will tell you by having a flashing light in the furnace. There is a small window you have to peak through.

Then take off the furnace cover, and there will be a legend that tells you what the issue is depending on how many times the light flashed. This will help you narrow it down. If it's something easy, you can try and fix it on your own. However, you may need to get a professional.

eZDoQPg8aa	It's a huge job but I think it's so worth it!  We're in the process of doing the same thing!<br>  <br>  You first have to rip up all the old carpet.  I would suggest using a dust mask when you do, especially if you're allergy prone.  You will have to remove the tack strips holding the carpet down and may have to scrape the old carpet pad up.  They aren't usually glued down but have a bad habit of getting stuck to the floor.  I've found a steamer and a wide bladed putty knife helps with the stuck patches.<br>  <br>  Now the really hard work; sanding the floor.  Some people prefer to have a professional take over at this point.  If you want the floors to look really new and smooth, you need a professional.  Our house is well over 100 years old and is rustic in nature so we don't want super smooth, new looking floors.  Sand, vacuum, let the dust settle overnight and wipe the floor with a damp microfiber mop or cloth to get as much of the dust up as you possibly can.  Even running an air filter in the area will help!  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of choices when it comes to finishes also.  We prefer the aged, low luster look of oil finishes but they are a bit smelly.  But an oil based finish is easier to repair should you need to than anything that is poly based.  <br>  <br>  Care after they are done is so much easier; a good sweeping on a regular basis and a damp mopping keep them looking good.  With oil based finishes, you might need to apply a new top coat every few years also.|`|esyyAHyCaa	It's a chore, but worth the effort.  It may not be glued.  Start in a corner with a pair of pliars & pull up the old carpet.  Remove the pad & the tack strips around the edge.  You may need to rent a sander to smooth the floor.  Apply a finish of your choice.
cff15c1430c57bf7fd07d037045ba112aa	Are they falling off "before" they open (swollen bud only) or "after" they open, but not yet fully?  It makes a difference as to what might be your problem.  I will however, give you 3 possible scenarios depending which one of my questions pertains to "your" question.  One possibility that could cause this is the "camellia bud mite". These critters infest the inner surface of bud petals. The flower bud edges will turn brown, then the entire bud turns brown and drops. <br>  <br>  A second possibility is called "premature bud drop" and appropriately named I might add. This disorder is caused by poor cultural practices such as ...providing the appropriate irrigation along with good soil drainage and possibly inadequate cultural care the previous summer and fall when the new buds were developing. <br>  <br>  A third possibility and this may be your culprit, is called "camellia petal blight" a fungal disease caused by rainy weather. A tall tale sign is that the petals turn brown, however if you  look closely at the petals  you will see that the veins are a much darker brown than the rest of the petal. The spores are harboring in the soil underneath the plant and when it rains they are splashed up onto the plant to infect the buds. To combat these spores, apply about 3 to 4 inches of organic mulch underneath the plant to reduce the spore survival and make sure to pick and dispose of any infected blossoms on or around the base of the plant. Thats about it I suppose. If you have anymore questions, feel free to do an update and I will try to give you more information.... Good Luck!<br>  <br>  ...Billy Ray|`|FlsrXuJOaa	I'm not positive, because camellias don't do well in my zone, but it sounds like it could be a fungus problem. Go to your garden center and get a systemic fungicide. They also might be able to answer your question, since they will be familiar with plants in your zone.|`|8b2NIrFqaa	ours does fine it maybe not enough water/sunlight/or nutriants in the soil

Might see if they sell a clear coat spray can to reseal or wait till you can afford to have it done by a pro.|`|8a78doTZaa	You need to go to a pro.  Don't go to a dealership because they will be expensive (as you found out) because they usually sublet out to a body shop.  It is important to have it fixed properly to maintain the cars value.<br>  <br>  Tim
xrgHNGj1aa	throw all your pots and pans on the lawn. or is that a garden kitchen?|`|zze8XmjLaa	get some top soil and build it on the kitchen counters. you will need some boards to enclose the garden.|`|6JHoNf3faa	seeds, dirt, water, some sunshine, tlc

You're a marine, semper fi!<br>  All you have to do is put painter's tape around the top of the wall where you want the first color to end (measure it, or you can get one of those little digital laser beam tools for under $15.)  Then paint your top color.  You can buy stencils to say whatever you want to put on the top stripe.  Voila' you're done, you saved a ton of dough, & you have the satisfaction of having done it yourself.  You can do it in half a day, seriously. Someone else won't do as good a job as you will.  Good luck.
TfdH0N47aa	why do you think they are called grow lights? If they didn't stay alive they would be called die lights...what a ridiculous question.<br>  <br>  Go to your local hardware/garden centre or hydroponics shop and they can hook you up with some "grow lights"<br>  <br>  Be warned that they are expensive, take a lot of power to run and can be annoyingly bright. They aren't typically used for keeping house plants alive.<br>  <br>  I suggest you get some different plants that can tolerate lower light.

I used to clean my suede shoes by holding them over a steaming kettle and brushing with this brush. Steam will definitely help but not sure what you could use in place of the brush.
