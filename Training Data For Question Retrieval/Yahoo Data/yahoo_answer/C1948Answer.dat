Iokj5gEiaa	I had virgin mobile until i got sprint but a pre paid phone is a service that you pay for first and then use the minutes. With virgin mobile i know that you can go onto the website and log in to your account and make changes like say your parents put twenty dollars on your phone you can go in and say that you want unlimited texts for thirty days and that cost twenty dollars but if you want to go month to month you will only spend ten dollars a month. I liked the prepaid phone because it just seemed a lot cheaper and easier to keep track of with money! hope i helped!

These small cameras (like cab drivers use) can feed a recorder in the trunk. The reason camcorders should not be used is because you cannot block the driver's view through the windshield. The small bullet security cams are WAY smaller than a camcorder and if mounted correctly, will not block any view. You can also point this small camera out the windshield - like the police use.<br>  <br>  If you have a camcorder and you want to record pointing out the windshield and over the hood like a passenger - or if you want to record yourself driving, I just mount the camcorder to a tripod and wedge the tripod in the area where the passenger legs and feet normally go. DO NOT change media or focus or do anything else with the camera when you are driving. PULL OVER, stop, put the car in park, apply the parking brake and do what you need to do. Press record and let it run - then drive. Having a LANC port on the camcorder and using a LANC can be handy... look it up.

Or you can use the micro SD card and download all the pics or other things to your computer (you will need a micro SD adapter and a SD card slot on your computer). If you cant do there things, then buy the USB cable. Which is easier than the options named above.<br>  <br>  It is hard to break. it looks like a very sturdy phone to me. and it has a plastic protective cover. it makes it look a little bulky (but you can take it off).<br>  <br>  Its basically a sidekick, except it has a touch screen.

ofpmRvHpaa	You gave a bit too much useless information about connections and hardly any information about what outputs you have on your cable box or xbox.<br>  <br>  And that receiver is only compatible with standard def video - not HD video so you really do NOT want to run video through the receiver.<br>  <br>  (sigh)<br>  <br>  You want to run HDMI cables straight to the TV from the cable box and xbox.  if your cable box does not have HDMI outputs - trade it in for a HD box. Should be the same price but gives you access to ABC, CBS, NBC, etc. channels without raising your monthly bill.<br>  <br>  That TV should have optical output. Run this to your receiver to get 5.1 sound from your xbox and HD shows.

I never recommend buying a camera that does not have an optical viewfinder. All of these cameras only have the LCD viewing screen. This means that you must hold the camera away from your face to take a picture, and that is the least stable way to hold a camera. In spite if the IS feature, it will be very difficult for you to get sharp pictures because of camera movement, particularly under low light conditions.<br>  Check out the SD1100 IS, the SD770 IS, the SD890 IS, or the SD850 IS. Your chances of getting good sharp pictures whit any of these cameras is far better because when you take pictures using an optical viewfinder, the way you have to hold the camera forces you to hold it steadier and gives you less camera movement.
jLTDqVHsaa	You use a FireWire (DV/i.Link/IEEE 1394) cable.  Same cable, different names.  You then use a video-editing program that supports this format, and almost all of them do.  It's still very commonly used, as the best-quality consumer video format in common use.<br>  <br>  If your computer does not have a 4-pin, 6-pin, or 9-pin FireWire port, you must purchase and install a card for this, and they're not all that expensive.|`|TaxYLHbMaa	they are the camera's which play digital dv cassettes , quickly getting old technology , and grabbing the video off the device requires a firewire or IEEE connection
Xxviy63Paa	Practically nothing, because like most action games it was developed on console kits. The pc version is a port or at least a modified version. Meaning it was begun in either OpenGL 2.0 or Direct X 9, depending on ps3 or xbox, or maybe both at once. When it was finished being built with those two libraries, it was a done product for console, and that's where the money is. They may have added a few effects when they made it DX10 compatible, if they did, but probably not so many... simply because there's no money in selling an action game on pc. <br>  <br>  If you have direct X 10 card, you may as well use direct x 10, it won't be any worse, that's for sure.

Xxviy63Paa	Sorry to say this but you've been had. There is no ps3 mod on the market. You can put a red LED light under the PS button on the controller if you want. Other than that, nothing. There is no way to rig it up to play free games.<br>  <br>  There is a way to make the ps3 play copied ps2 games with swap magic, but only ntsc 60gb ps3's can, it only works with ps2 games and it will work only until Sony shuts it down with a firmware upgrade. Besides, swap magicking is a workaround, not a mod, not even really a hack.<br>  <br>  The ps3 firmware will always play only games that are on original blu-ray discs, or that are downloaded legally from the playstation store.  They've got keycodes and can't be faked, the firmware can tell if they're genuine. If a way to play pirated ps3 games were developed, Sony would just upgrade the firmware again to bust anyone that did it. <br>  <br>  If your ps3 has successfully installed the firmware and you've created a PSN account with no problems, you haven't got a modded console at all. Meaning you were ripped off, but that's better than if it were modded, in which case it would be banned and bricked.|`|od51qzQtaa	you do not need a modified PS3 to play downloaded games period.

I always suggest you use the best image quality your camera is capable of producing because if you ever take a picture good enough to want an enlargement of, original image quality is very important and good quality images are fairly large. <br>  <br>  15MB is probably good for 2 high quality images (or at the most 3 depending on the type of picture you are taking).

AbRfd29Haa	I'll tell you, you're hardly the first to ask this question. And watch out... suggesting a Nikon to a hardcore Canon fan is like suggesting a Yankee's cap to a Red Sox fan -- there are bigtime fans, and they won't even consider the other guy. <br>  <br>  The good news is that they're both excellent camera lines, and cover all the ground from beginning serious amature to professional. You really can't go wrong with either choice... and I'm not just saying that because I have two Nikon film SLRs, one Canon film SLR, and a DSLR from each line. <br>  <br>  Back in the dark ages, my Dad had Konicas, so naturally, when I did the research, I bought... Olympus. I have an OM-1, OM-4, and a few of the cheaper bodies. Both companies stopped making serious cameras for awhile, so my Dad moved to Nikon, and I moved to Canon. Same deal with the digital shift. <br>  <br>  There are some general advantages to either line, so I'll tell you what I know from the other guys prespective. I always felt the lower-end Nikons were a bit more rugged, just a little more serious feeling than the lower-end Canons. Nikons can mount just about any lens made for Nikon since the early 60s, though you need modern ones to use automatic functions and autofocus, obviously. <br>  <br>  My Dad felt Canon tended to be ahead of Nikon on technology, and that they had a somewhat more complete system.. though realistically, just how many different 80-200/300 zooms do you need in a single product line? Canon's possibly stronger on the very high end.. look at a football game and you'll mostly see photographers with big white Canon teles.. many of which cost more than my first two cars did. My Dad ultimately gave me the two film Nikons, and when he died, I got his digital as well, and became a permanent fence sitter on the Nikon/Canon border (70's-80's Olympus still kicked 70's-80's Konicas, hands down). <br>  <br>  My advice is to do the research and lean what you can about the models in your price range. As others have suggested, you're going to buy a body now, but that'll get replaced in time, while the lenses are hopefully keepers, assuming you stick with your system choice. Really try out the models you're looking at before you buy, see which one fits you best. Neither is the wrong choice, but there may be some intangible that makes one more right for you, personally.<br>  <br>  Buying into a system camera line is like a marriage.... and you don't necessarily bring a ring on a first date. Get to know these cameras, take them to dinner or the movies or at least use them. Seek advice -- you're doing that, good. Check online forums, particularly what people don't like about either model... you can lean a great deal there.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	There is no best camera.<br>  <br>  That's like your dad telling you that he's going to buy you a car, and you come here asking what's the best car. What do you think people are going to say? You are going to get every answer under the sun.<br>  <br>  Nikon, Canon, Sony Alpha, Pentax, they each have pros and cons, they can each do something the other cannot.<br>  <br>  What is that? You have a lot of research ahead of you, I don't think I could fit all that here, nor would I want to.<br>  <br>  When you do buy a brand, you are buying into the lenses and everything else tied to that brand. You are also stuck with all the little things that one brand of camera can and can't do.<br>  <br>  Hit the search engines.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|i5OVORXgaa	It's all based on personal preference... Canon users will tell you to choose Canon... Nikon users will tell you to choose Nikon... BTW, I love my Canon!<br>  <br>  Is this your first DSLR? Are you planning on becoming a serious photographer? If so, buy a cheaper camera and invest the rest of your money in lenses and accesories. Camera bodies come and go (they quickly become outdated)... lenses will last forever (if well taken care of)! Look into getting the Canon Rebel XT or Nikon D40.<br>  <br>  Also, actually go into a camera store and hold the cameras in your hands! Play with them. See which one you'll be most comfortable with.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Personally I would go with Nikon for that price range I suggest Nikon D90.Picture quality are great and can take HD video<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ENOZY4?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001ENOZY4" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ENO...</a>|`|j5Apt8hWaa	You are going to have to take your time and research both systems.  you are not buying a camera like you do when you buy a P&S, but a camera system.  The body will be replaced every three to five years, so the lenses you purchase are more important the the actual camera.<br>  <br>  Which to buy?  Go into a camera store and hold both brands in your hands and see which feels the best to you and which is the easiest for you to navigate through its menu<br>  <br>  Most bang for the buck?  There is a nice D40 with both a 18-55 mm and 55-200 mm lens.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDPMEI/ref=noref?ie=UTF8&s=photo" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDP...</a>
Xxviy63Paa	If you can get a 60gb ps3 for $450, do it now. That's a good price for a 60. They are the prized model. I have one and it's worth it, even though it's used. Much better than the newer ones.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about whether the cables are included. A fine HDMI cable or HDMI to DVI cable costs $3 online. Paying more than $10 for one is agreeing to be ripped off. The sony component video cable is $20, and you can get 3rd-party ps3 component cables that work just as well for about $6. So don't worry about the price of those, just don't buy them at radio shack or video only...|`|WAOkgdj6aa	There are 2 models for the PS3 that are continued as of right now.<br>  <br>  80GB is 399. Comes with 1 controller, 80GB Harddrive built into the console, RCA Cables (NON High Definition Cables), one USB Cable, and an AC Adapter.<br>  <br>  The other is the 160GB model which is $519 (most places). Comes with 1 controller, 160GB harddrive built in, RCA Cables (non HD cables again), one USB Cable, AC Adapter, Drakes Fortune (game) and a voucher for the game PAIN<br>  <br>  Neither models come with HD cables and have a harddrive built in. Older models never came with HD cables either. You have to buy either Component or HDMI seperately.|`|73t6LfrDaa	To answer your question, the HD is an abbreviation for Hard Drive. In regards to the difference in machines and price, it comes down to whether or not you want to play PS2 games on your PS3. <br>  <br>  There are several different models of the PS3 with hard drive space ranging from 20GB to 160GB. If you are wanting to play PS2 games, you are going to need one of three different console models. The original 60GB models have full PS2 backwards compatibility as they have the "emotion" chip from the original PS2s hardwired into them. That little chip makes these machines very rare and hard to get your hands onto.<br>  <br>  The other two models that play PS2 games are the 20GB and the 80GB that was bundled with Metal Gear Solid 4. Both the 20GB and the MGS4 80GB were released with a software-based emulator that granted about 40% backwards compatibility with PS2 games. Because this compatibility is software based, and not hardware as it was in the 60GB, the PS2 games will play a bit slower and may not work at all.<br>  <br>  Shortly after the 80GB MGS4 bundle came out, Sony released a 40GB model that was much cheaper. However, they made this possible by removing all backwards compatibility and have not since included it with any of their systems.<br>  <br>  The two systems currently being produced are the 80GB without MGS4 and the 160GB model that comes bundled with Uncharted: Drakes Fortune.<br>  <br>  I hope I've been able to help answer your questions. If you have any more, I'd be happy to help.|`|AA12001042	its a lil more expensive cause it has backwards compatability

eVptHOOBaa	Two things:<br>  <br>  1. Good performance at high ISOs. It should be able to take acceptable quality pictures at ISO 1000 and higher. <br>  <br>  2. Fast lens. At least f/2.8 for zoom or f/1.8 or f/1.4 for a prime (here smaller number means faster lens, but also means more expensive one).<br>  <br>  Of course you will only find these features in dSLR cameras, and for #1 you'd be looking at more expensive high end ones....... I'm afraid short of a powerful flash or off-camera strobe (or continuous light), that's your only choice. Point and Shoot cameras are absolutely useless in dark/low light situations except in close range with flash, and even then the results are quite bad.<br>  <br>  LEM.<br>  <br>  P.S. Just to give you an idea what I mean by expensive - you'll be looking at at least $2000 for a basic kit with a prime lens (no zoom) or about $2500-3000 for a zoom lens kit...|`|j5Apt8hWaa	You will want a camera that <br>  <br>  1) has a large sensor<br>  2) can use interchangeable lenses and has "fast" ones available for the camera.<br>  3) can produce low noise images at high resolution.<br>  <br>  You will still need to learn how to hold the camera steady while taking the shots.

xTioPxaVaa	There were a lot of versions of that song.  Originally written and recorded by Buddy Miles (who drummed with Hendrix on the "Band Of Gypsies" album), it was also released as a single with Buddy and Carlos Santana besides the life recording with Hendrix.<br>  <br>  If you're referring to Jimi's take on the sound, it would have most likely been a Strat, into a Vox wah, a Dallas Aribiter Fuzz Face, and then to a couple of Marshall's.  Of course, all of Jimi's stuff was supposed tweaked by Roger Mayer, so who knows exact what was going on there.<br>  <br>  The trick with wah pedals is, that while they all pretty much same the circuit (they are, in reality a variable pass-band filter), minor differences in the filter inductor added up to very large differences in the sound.<br>  <br>  So, short of finding a 40 year old wah pedal, your best bet is one of the Dunlop reissues.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

AA11629848	Sorry but Walmart don't sell "photographers", but they sell cameras!!! Try one of those, they are cheaper to maintain (a photographer needs food, clothing, equipment, car, apartment and so on). So try buying a camera instead of a "photographer".|`|TaxYLHbMaa	you want a slr camera , although sony ax is good for the auto focus and ease , a slr in general in the right hands is what makes a camera the best , a slr camera additionally does give you the options to get professional , but it is more about what you know about the dynamics of what you are shooting at that will win you awards , any slr is good , sony and canon have the best lens and quality

Whenever we were trying to get into a phone system like the Gas Co., he had a trick of going with the "next" phone number.  Say the Gas Co. is 555-1212.  He would call 555-1213 or 555-1211.  That always got him a LIVE person!  Try that!<br>  <br>  These days, most of the LIVE folks are in India, anyway & cannot really solve my problem!

s7Muujxzaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  TV Tech is a little off with his math, not to mention energy usage is measured in kilowatt hours, not kilowatts as he writes.. If we were to assume 100 watts for a 19 inch versus 300 watts for a 52 inch, that is 200 watt difference times the hours per month run time...maybe 8 hrs day x 30 days = 48kw hours x10 cents per kw hour = $4.80 per month.|`|w4I9oj2Maa	Yes they do...but they only run about 4kW a day...that's only 120 kW a month....That's only $9.60 a month to run it.

LCD is the current winner for flat panel, while DLP seems to have won out over LCoS for rear projection and high-end projectors. <br>  <br>  They were just losing too much money in the TV business to keep at it. It's probable the lousy worldwide economy is a factor here, but realistically, LCDs pretty much managed to eliminate the advantages of plasma (high contrast, primarily), and beat them on other issues (less than half the power, much longer life, thinner panels, higher refresh speeds, blacker blacks in the very latest models, no burn-in).|`|XvL0Ly2Waa	I don't understand why they are doing this considering they have televisions on consumer reports top 10 list.

You won't be able to use a bluetooth or USB mic, but you can run sound through the regular RCA (red and white) plugs into a seperate sound system. Just go to Settings>Sound Settings>Audio Output Settings and change the output to "Audio Input Connector." Then just plug the RCA cords into a seperate sound system (you might be able to get headphones that plug into RCA, or at least an adapter for it if you'd prefer them over real speakers).

EQcI4CnVaa	If you are talking about cell phone plans, it depends on your carrier. I have AT&T/cingular, they allow you to switch plans 5 months prior to the 2 year contract ends, which usually includes a new phone.

(or also if you just need a phone handset, you can put your SIM card into someone's else's unused AT&T phone)

XqvksbhTaa	You'll need a DVD-writer to do this.<br>  <br>  Plug the counsel into the DVD writer, and then go out of that into your TV.<br>  <br>  If you're planning on taking this video and putting it on your computer for editing or uploading to a site such a youtube, you may want to look into a Capture Card that plugs directly into your computer. Video captured this way will be MUCH higher quality because you're taking digital information (the Wii), converting it to analog (the DVD), and then converting it back to digital (your computer). Every conversion results in a loss of quality, and a DVD writer will only write standard low-definition video. With a capture card, the source is never converted and therefor the quality of the resulting video will only be limited by the Wii itself.<br>  <br>  All of the above is true for the audio as well.
iUB7I2z3aa	I'm pretty sure it is.  I heard it and that's what I thought too! I love that song!!
vN4v4fR2aa	Zach X is correct.  DirecTV can get you the regional sports networks with the Sports Pack ($12.99 or less per month as of march 4th, until then $12 or less -- less only if you have other premium packages like the movie channels).<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, though, due to licensing and whatnot, you are not able to view any live, professional sporting events outside of your local area on those channels. It's actually against federal law for DirecTV to give you that programming based off of territorial rights and whatnot.<br>  <br>  If you do want a professional team you can get the sports subscriptions (nba league pass, nhl center ice, nfl sunday ticket, etc.) and get them so long as they are not blacked out in your area (playing your home team, available on a regional sports network that CAN provide it to you, or on a local station are the common causes for a blackout.<br>  <br>  Getting the Sports Pack is easy. You can change your programming selections online (directv.com) or you can call and speak with a representative or use the automated system to make the change.|`|A2jyJ89iaa	The only way you can get FSN Ohio is if you subscribe to the sports package. Also, if you want to watch pro sports, you will need to subscribe to the specific sports package.

And the towel trick doesn't work often|`|4AQPx75qaa	If it's under warranty, obviously send it in to Microsoft.  If it's not under warranty and you have the RRoD (Red Ring of Death aka 3 red lights), the best fix is the "X-Clamp Replacement".  The towel trick is worthless.  At most you will get a week or two out of it and repeating it many times just makes your console worse.  X-clamp replacement prevents it from getting worse.<br>  <br>  Also, it shuts off because it has overheating shutdown detection.  When you do the X-Clamp fix, you take out the spring clamps (called "X-clamps" by the modding community) and replace them with machine screws (available at hardware stores).  With screws you can tighten the heatsinks down on the chips tighter and without putting stress on the back of the board (which the X clamps do).  It involves opening up your Xbox 360 (I have a YouTube video on this if you need a guide) and then some simple mechanical work (you'll need a screwdriver and possibly a drill, that's about it).  The parts are 8 5mm machine screws, 5mm nylon washers, and 5mm steel washers.  There are plenty of guides out there that can help you with this fix.<br>  <br>  You also have to put new thermal paste on the chips, though all of this is explained in the guides.  After installing the heatsinks with the screws, you overheat the graphics chip (GPU) by putting the fan on just the CPU (the overheating sensor is in the CPU) and letting the GPU get really hot.  After that, the 360 should work.<br>  <br>  I recommend tightening the screws (at least the ones on the GPU) as tightly as you can without it messing up (at a certain point it will instantly RRoD, find this point and then loosen just slightly until it works).  That's how it is on my 360, though every case is different.|`|54y0GDJqaa	Huh maybe you have it to were the power button is pushed.Its supposed to turn off but with flashing lights.The towel trick only worked for a little while for me so I would send to xbox.Thats what it always comes down too.Hoped I helped.Maybe the towel trick wont work for your problem also.

EpvHhbByaa	Get the Xbox 360 version, it isn't gimped like the Wii version. The 360 version also has all of the Downloadable Songs (a few are missing on the wii version (seriously why do even the people who try to make good games on the wii think the wii can't do anything)) and unlike the wii version, it supports voice chat. It also has a tattoo creator that you can put on your characters I believe, and the wii doesn't have it.|`|SMCa68oTaa	well on one of the feature for the wii, you can use the remote and nunchuck for drums which is pretty decent. but really there isnt much of a difference. Also i know you can buy songs. But on 360, i know you could party and such. So if you want better online play i would get the 360.

The Xbox 360 is very old and doesn't have many features. Ever since the Wii appeared, it got so famous. Who could beat that? So get the game on the Wii. Oh yeah, I reconmend you to get "Guitar Hero 3 Old Lengends of Rock". I did it and it's my favorate guitar hero game.|`|pMdnxIhNaa	ff you have 3 controllers buy the wii one but if you dont buy the xbox one. If you dont have all remotes you cant play with everyone at the same time but on xbox it uses wireless usb so you dont need more than 1 controller for the mic. ethier way buy it great for parties

You can then use a photo editor - any photo editor - to convert the image to black and white or sepia. You actually get a better range of greyscale detail this way. You will also able to apply filter effects, just as if, for example you had used a red filter when you were shooting. Plus, if the picture looked better in color you'll be glad you've got the color image.
JxKAVCtkaa	i have a little experience with onkyos...<br>  first, if you're using ps3, make sure it is set to digital audio output through the optical port in the ps3 menu. it won't happen automatically<br>  then make sure the optical port on the onkyo is set to the right input in the setup menu. it should say the default setting next to the port on the back. use that input preferably<br>  then check if it has an audio input selection button. it will cycle through analog, digital or auto. you want digital or auto.<br>  if you're using it in zone 2 you need analog|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Well first you must assing the input.  Then you must select it.  For example, I have both HD cable and a PS3 running through my receiver.  To play the PS3 I push the "DVD" button on the remote.  To watch cable TV I push the "Cable" button on the remote.  HDMI 1 is assigned to the DVD input and HDMI 2 is assigned to the Cable source.

YbzNb3R6aa	The PS3 remembers the settings you last used; in your case, it remembered the TV at your house, and the component cables you used to hook it up. To get it to accept the new composite cables at your friends house, hold the power button until the Playstation gives 2 audible beeps. This has to be done on it's first power up, not while it's already on. <br>  <br>  When this is done, it will boot into the XMB and allow you to change the video and audio settings.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|RyvKws7Laa	Sounds like you might need to go into the PS3 settings and change it from component out (which is what you're using at home) to Composite out (which is what you're trying to use at the friends house).<br>  <br>  Also are you sure you're on the right input on the friend's TV?  You didn't give a TV model and I've seen a few that allow video/audio lines selected separately.

They only real difference between them is that some have live view and others do not. I would look at the Canon Rebels or the Nikon D40 or D60. You can also look at Pentax and Sony. As I said they are all pretty much the same but it really comes down to which one feels best in your hands and has the features you want. Check out the various models at Dpreview and then go to a camera store and play around with the ones your interested in. I would suggest buying a cheaper camera and investing any extra money in lenses. Lenses will make a much bigger difference than a camera body.|`|mjv2pVEBaa	It depend on to plan on photography. If you need take photography as your site income i preferred you buy the middle range SLR camera. Take a look on the spec for the camera. I recommend taking SLR with lens motor on the body.

It's due to a simple method of setting the ISO. There's a way around it that can be easily mastered on using the camera.<br>  Viewfinder is set to around -1 Diopter (useful in slight myopes to people with normal eye-sight) and so for people with other power corrections (glasses), it's difficult to use.<br>  The kit lens (35-70) is not optically very good.<br>  <br>  <br>  There's nothing automatic in it apart from the mechanical timer that can be used as a mirror up and timer to release the shutter on its own (if you consider this automatic).<br>  <br>  Compared to Canon AE-1P this is a very basic model but it's compatible with almost every Nikon lens (except some very old Nikkors and new Nikkor DX lenses) made.<br>  <br>  A slightly better model than FM-10 is Nikon FM-2 which has been discontinued but you might find it used and in good condition.|`|AA12323486	Besides the quality, it's more comperable to the Nikon FM2.

Y3dFm6uGaa	Here's the thing...Companies have specialized in their services for years.  The phone company gives good phone service.  The cable companies give good cable service.  Internet providers give good internet service.  Now everybody wants to do everything!  They don't do it all GOOD!<br>  <br>  My son bundled with Comcast (the cable provider in his area) and found that his cable TV & internet was just fine, but his phone service was 'out' more than it was 'on.'  (Out 27 days of 30/31 each month!)<br>  <br>  I bundled with ATT.  My phone service was great; the internet was okay most of the time; but the cable service was mostly 'out.'  Most days I was looking at 'snow' on the TV screen!<br>  <br>  At this point in time, I would say go with the company that provides the service.  You might have to pay a little more, but at least you get the service.  Eventually, it will all even out and everyone will be providing good service.  But for now, bundle at your own risk!

BBOR7Vwmaa	Ipod Touch<br>  <br>  Touch is at least 10 times better than any other iPod from apple.<br>  <br>  It looks great.<br>  <br>  Its great for listening to music, and is laid out perfectly<br>  <br>  Watching a movie is actually good. I do it often, unlike I would on a crappy little screen made for text like on the other iPods.<br>  <br>  It can view photos in awesome quality and make them your background. It can even take a screen shot of your iPod and keep it as a photo.<br>  <br>  It has a handy home button and a lock button which is clicker instead of switch.<br>  <br>  You can access the internet on it using Wi-Fi, which is really easy and quite fast (or maybe just because my internet's really fast), you can use it as a good calculator, time, navigator in the city hot spots, weather, video watcher, keeping your contacts, mail the lot.<br>  <br>  You can get third party applications (which I use MORE than music videos and photos put together) which do things for me like night clock, thousands of games, torch, drawing art program, facebook and myspace, the train, tram and bus timetables, language translator, it even has a cool application which connects to your computer so you can control its iTunes. The apps are free or paid (from a dollar up). If you can afford to pay for apps, I find the paid ones are the most fun<br>  <br>  Its slim, and has in built speakers (but mine doesnt because I have the first gen) and fits great in your pocket<br>  <br>  If your not worried about size or money or whatever the touch is the best iPod<br>  <br>  I payed $500 for my 16gb and its worth every cent even though it's first gen.<br>  <br>  Sorry to make it long<br>  Alex|`|lapMAm0Aaa	YES YES AND YES!!!

1HtTxOOQaa	I played Fallout 3 on my PC and I really loved the game. I choose the PC version over the 360 or PS3, cause the game had better graphics on PC. I played GTA4 on my PS3 but was a little disappointed as I liked GTA:SA more. I loved the GTA4 story and graphics, but GTA:SA had better missions and some of the concepts like making gangs and raging war on other gangs was so cool that they should have been incorporated in GTA4.<br>  <br>  Fallout 3 was probably one of the best games of 2008. I still feel that MGS4 was the Game of the Year (I have been a huge MGS fan and the last one was awesome).  As for which I enjoyed more GTA4 or Fallout 3 then the answer would be Fallout 3. The customizable option is crazy. I found it hard at first, but as one levels up, it's great fun. <br>  Oh.. and I choose evil :-<>|`|1WgOj89kaa	I agree, Fallout 3 is incredible, huge environment, amazing storyline, destroys GTAIV|`|785440e73a90380b1cea867ceab71780aa	No. <br>  <br>  Poll: Depends.

The storyline is good but kinda short. So I agree with you GTA IV isn't GOTY (even though the storyline is good and it's fun to torture people). But I didn't like Fallout 3 that much either. My other friend has that it's ok.<br>  <br>  POLL: <br>  in real life: good<br>  in games: EVIL HAHAHA!!!|`|1aqrRzqLaa	No, I have both Fallout 3 and Grand Theft Auto IV GTA IV's storyline kicks the **** out of Fallout 3's by far!|`|aROiy2Gnaa	some high ranked guy said that grand theft autos storyline was better than any movie he saw and i would rather go with gta 4 becuase it is like awesome and way better than any other game out there buy far|`|jxpV13rTaa	fallout 3 is much better and evil because stealing is a must in that game.

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	My husband has the S3 IS and it's not a bad little camera (great 12x optical zoom). I wouldn't recommend the S5 IS because it actually has worse ISO performance than the S3 IS and it's not really much of an upgrade, anyway.<br>  <br>  Your best option in super-zoom Canon cameras, are either the SX10 IS or the new SX1 IS (which is now going to be available in the US, after initially not planning to be released in the US).<br>  <br>  Both cameras are almost identical, however the SX1 IS has much better features, and so costs more.<br>  <br>  The key differences between these two cameras are...<br>  <br>  The SX1 IS has a CMOS sensor, which allows continuous shooting at 4fps. The SX10 IS uses a CCD sensor and has fairly slow continuous frame rates commonly found in point & shoot type cameras.<br>  <br>  The SX1 IS also allows FULL HD movie recording of 1920x1080 @ 30fps. The SX10 IS has a top movie resolution of only 640x480 @ 30fps.<br>  <br>  And, the best thing about the SX1 IS is that it has the ability to now shoot in RAW (with a firmware upgrade available from Canon in March).<br>  <br>  However, having said all that...nothing beats the image quality and performance of a dSLR, so if you're really wanting better image quality than what these point & shoot super zooms can provide...you should have a look at a dSLR. <br>  <br>  I have the XSi (450D) and hubby has the little S3 IS and I can tell you that my dSLR is the superior camera, especially in regards to performance and ISO capability. I can shoot images at ISO 800-1600, where the S3 IS (and similar models) have very poor ISO capability. <br>  <br>  So, when considering your next camera don't discount a dSLR. If you can use the full manual controls on the S3 IS, you will have no trouble learning how to use a dSLR. <br>  <br>  But, if you're not particularly concerned about recording Full HD movies (and you don't want a dSLR), then the SX10 IS with it's 20x optical zoom...would make a very good choice (just don't expect great image quality when shooting in lower light).<br>  <br>  good luck...|`|AA10722993	Here are the two side by side----<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?method=sidebyside&cameras=canon_s5is%2Ccanon_sx10is&show=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a><br>  <br>  I would get the SX10.   Much better zoom.|`|Y1HJkHdqaa	The SX10 IS is a currant model camera, has a 20x optical zoom range, and 10-megapixel resolution. I consider it to be probably the best and most flexible point and shoot camera on the market right now.<br>  <br>  The S5 IS is an older model camera and I am not sure you can still buy a new one, but a Google search shows me that several are available used or refurbished at very good prices. The S5 IS has less zoom range (12x) and less megapixel resolution (8.0) but is also very good and flexible. <br>  <br>  If price is no object, go for the SX10 IS (more megapixels = bigger prints and more image cropping capabilities if needed), but if you use either camera carefully and proprely, they are both excellent amd flexible picture takers.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	SX5 IS is awesome camera but SX10 IS is newer model and come with better features,high mega pixel,better zoom.If I were you I would go with X10IS|`|uJBnZWtcaa	The SX10 IS (like just about every other Super Zoom) is known for the noisy photos it produces at ISO's of 400 and above. Since I'm often taking photos in sun/shade conditions and I want RAW for wide-angle shots, I've given up my dream of owning one.  The S5 IS is still for sale.  The big news from Canon is that they are (finally) selling the SX1 IS in the U.S.  Everyone's been talking about this camera.  It's the SX10 with a few upgrades.  4fps burst mode, hot shoe, RAW (with firmware upgrade), lens thread for filters, HD video......  It'll cost more than the SX10 and it goes on sale in March.  I'm sticking with my SX3 a while longer.

lWxUn0Xraa	actually it depends on when the phone was launched. if its an older smartphone like the moto q or palm treo 700wx, then yes, its possible to activate them without getting a data plan. <br>  HOWEVER if you want to use a phone that was launched past i think november 14 2008.... something like that, then no, you cannot activate it without a data plan. <br>  <br>  what you can do is, call verizon and file a claim. say you want to just let corprorate know that you're very unhappy with the fact that they are taking this choice away from you. it won't do much if you're the only one complaining but eventually when more people do it, it may change their policies.|`|boh5rCNlaa	cant be done.. sry

Xxviy63Paa	If you mean gamepad, the ps3 sixaxis is brilliantly effective on pc's. Its charge cable doubles as a usb input so it's ready made for use on a pc. You can't use the motion sensors, but you still have the two sticks and at least 14 pressure-sensitive buttons. Two of the buttons are leveraged for use as either triggers, or as gas-pedal/brake; they can be set up as joystick axes too.<br>  <br>  Not all the buttons always work, that's why I said at least 14. The ones that might not are L3 and R3, and select. Everything else works perfect.

AbRfd29Haa	An advanced electronics device, like a PSP or a PS3 or iPhone or whatever, is really a small computer (well, the PS3 is actually a fairly serious conmputer). While it's not as obvious as in a PC, such devices have a set of programs, kept in flash memory (in the case of cellphones and PSPs, at least) which includes an operating system and a bunch of applications. <br>  <br>  When you download an update, you usually replace the whole thing at once: all applications, all of the operating system. So you are changing the programming, and often, adding totally new features. Obviously, they are features enabled by the new software -- no hardware changes were made. But really, the new features did not exist before, they're new, they were added by the firmware update. <br>  <br>  Just like adding a new program to your PC or a new game to the PSP... previously, it couldn't do that new thing, but with the new code, it can. <br>  <br>  I designed the hardware for a Radio Control system (handheld controller and in-car transceiver) that could be updated via the web, much as you do a PSP or iPhone. Any time our software developers had a great new feature,  we had good suggestions from users, or saw a cool new feature in another company's RC units,our software guys would chung away for awhile, and before you knew it, we'd have our unit doing the same thing.. and a new update would go out. Hook up your "Sensor" or "React", update, and you now have the new feature.

The PS3s architecture is too different for an emulator on the PC.<br>  <br>  LBP is also a community based game, and any emulation or hacking would deny you access to those features. If you actually have the disk then your computer can't read it anywhay because I highly doubt you have a bluray disc player in your PC, let alone one that can play copy protected PS3 discs.<br>  <br>  Basically you need a PS3 to play LBP.|`|59Rd381caa	No. The PS3 is too powerful for an emulator. Your PC probably can't even play PS3 blu rays. It would destroy your PC if you tried sorry. If you really want to play LBP you need a PS3 and let me tell you getting a PS3 is alot cheaper then buying a PC that could run a PS3 emulator (if there was even one). And there is such thing as a PS2 emulator.|`|WAOkgdj6aa	No, there is no such thing.

nQ7G1nBVaa	You can play recordings any time after the old DVR is canceled.<br>  <br>  To transfer them to your computer, you would copy them to the computer as if the computer were any other video recorder. To do that, you need a tuner/capture card and recording software.
1HtTxOOQaa	Well, there are 3 basic models currently which are 40GB(in some countries, this model is discontinued), 80GB and 160GB (none are backward compatible cause sony stopped it). The basic thing you will have to remember, is that all these models are same in every aspect except the capacity. Also, PS3 uses the same drives as a laptop uses, so you can replace the internal drive with a larger one (like I have replaced my 60 GB one for a 500GB). This swapping is very simple and even the PS3 comes with a manual to do it(or you can see a video at youtube to see how to do it). <br>  <br>  If you don't want to replace the drive or something, then go for the 160GB one cause it has ample storage (as you have mentioned money is no criteria). But before buying it, the main question is: will you ever use it? I am a movie buff and I have stored nearly 150 movies and thousands of songs, then too my PS3 is not even half full (note I have a 500GB drive). If your son is going to use it to store movies,songs...  then get one with a larger drive or else go for the 80GB one cause it strikes the perfect balance.<br>  <br>  In terms of accessories, if you have a HDTV at home, then you will need to buy HDMI cables separately. Also, make sure you buy a PS3 which come with a Dualshock 3 controller(DS3) and not a six-axis one (the DS3 also has six-axis features+vibration). All new PS3 come with a DS3 controller, so check on the box if it's DS3 and then only buy it. <br>  Thats it. Thats all you will have to buy (you can buy a separate remote if you wanna play co-op) for normal use. You can also buy a keypad and bluetooth headset (for online play), if you want.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	first of all they dont make the 60GB ones anymore and it is either the 160GB and the 80GB and neither than them have backwards compadibily .  i would go with the 80GB one and i would by all four conrtrollers and the playstaion eye. it is a microphone and camera thing in one.|`|pl2SocVKaa	you need to get the 60gb and you have to get the sony official bluetooth headset a blu ray remote and if your getting the games that support it a playstation eye and if you have a hdtv a hdmi cable|`|xwEPYEqSaa	Get the 160GB it comes with the Game Uncharted: Drake's Fortune which is one of the best PS3 games in my opinion. Then you should buy the game SOCOM: Confrontation not only because it is one of the best PS3 games but it comes with a free Blue-Tooth headset if you buy the bundle for 59.99. The last thing is the game Killzone 2 (it's rated M (17+) if that's a problem) this game is the most highly anticipated PS3 game from what reviews have said and my experience playing the demo this is the best looking PS3 game on the market. It is going to be released in the USA on Friday. It's going to be selling out for a couple of weeks so if it is not there when you buy your PS3 get the game Metal Gear Solid 4 it's so much fun to play it has the best graphics of any game on a console ever.<br>  <br>  So if you get what I suggest:<br>  160GB PS3 w/ Uncharted: 500$<br>  SOCOM Confrontationw/ headset 60$<br>  Killzone 2: 60$<br>  <br>  610$ thats a lot of money if that is too much then instead of getting Killzone 2 or Metal Gear Solid get the game Assassin's Creed it's about 30$ now and it is so much fun to play. It has a sequel coming out soon so beat the original before the 2nd one.|`|vs3vz6lIaa	the 80 gig because then you have more memory and you won't have to buy i cord to plug in and then have to buy a memory card and it will make you feel better and i really don't think that you should get the 160 because it comes with a game and that adds to the price and you may not like uncharted and also my opinion is that 160 gig's is a lot of memory and you don't need it|`|VcNHahtgaa	Right now, Best Buy is selling PS3's for $399, with a FREE $50 Gift Card meaning they are giving you free $50 AND your choice of a FREE Guitar Hero 3 or Guitar Hero Aerosmith. Also Guitar Hero 3 is about $69.99 and they are giving you that for free.<br>  <br>  Basically your going to get a PS3 for $399.99 with:<br>  $50 Gift Card [Save $50, $349.99]<br>  Guitar Hero 3 or Aerosmith [Save $70, $279.99]<br>  <br>  The deal is only this week, check your local Best Buy if they are doing this also.|`|pSHPYW9baa	OK, here's what you need to know. If you need backwards compatibility, get the 20 or 60 GB. But if you're all about the space, get the 80 or 160 GB. But, these ones with more GB, have some disadvantages. The recent 80 GB and 160 GB have only 2 USB ports, so that could cause trouble with games like Rock Band, and Guitar Hero: World Tour. So, if you don't want backwards compatibility, just space, then get the 80 GB or 160 GB. But if you want that backwards compatibility, the older models with backwards compatibility should probably be online on sites like eBay, GameStop, Amazon.com, and others. Hope I could help. :D|`|v4E8nylXaa	well there are only 2 that are made anymore. the 80 gb and 160 gb. they both are the same thing but one has double the hard drive of the other. i would say go online and but one of the old 80 ge ps3 if u want a memory card reader and extra usb ports. <br>  as 4 accessories, get a laptop cooling fan. the ps3 can get a little hot so the fans help cool it down. mine is a fan and usb hub, 2in1. some kind of headset, wireless or not is up to u. if u plan on installing linux on it than get a usb keyboard and mouse. and if you need more hard drive space buy an new laptop hard drive and install it on your ps3.|`|0b03e2fdb4768b40ff4ab8b109b1ab6faa	80 gb is enough for most gamers.  You need accessories also to start and add on from there. There is a one-stop shop I have been to that has just about anything you will need. www.productswii.com.  Have found lots of things there to be helpful. <br>  Good Luck and Good Gaming.|`|1aqrRzqLaa	Just by the standard 80gb model.

Accessories I would buy are: HDMI cord, Wireless texting pad, and the official sony bluetooth headset for online communication.|`|pMdnxIhNaa	well if you still want to play ps2 games i would buy the 80 gig because it is the only one that plays the games.<br>  but other than that it really doesnt matter i have the 40 and i have no problem with it its great and i play it every day|`|QoWi0hzWaa	umm yeh if u wanted backwards conpatability ud need 160G song made it now, get a mic and get a longer usb cable to charge your controler and your all good!|`|AA12001042	80GB|`|QxtdyNvgaa	get 160gb becuase more space and free playstation store purchases and vouchers
kL6amV8gaa	This is a great phone, above and beyond every phone I've ever owned.  I  had the LG Voyager(dont make fun..lol) to the Iphone and I wasn't real happy with the iphone, no copy and paste feature, no expandable memory slot, Edge suxs, and text messaging was a nightmare.  So i turned it in and went back to VZW.  I got the omnia and I've been very happy.  Amazing camera, fast internet, good battery life(lasts all day even though I'm constantly talking or online).  There's more features than there are stars in the sky...lol.  5mp camera, the screen allows you to rotate the phone and transition from portrait to landscape ANYTIME not like most other phones that only allow u to do this when running certain applications, TV Out...yes u can actually run a line to your TV and output your video to your TV, optical mouse...this phone has an optical mouse incase u don't want to use the stylus, Windows Mobile, Mobile Office, Wifi...there is so much more!  I would definitely recommend it.  I have nothing but good things to say about it.<br>  <br>  Possible cons, sometimes don't get service in big buildings(a common problem with most phones) but Wifi allows you to still use the internet in large buildings.  Sometimes laggy when transitions from vertical to horizontal when running a lot of programs at once.(another common problem with multitasking phones)  That's about it....

Plug the reader into any USB port on your computer and BINGO!, problem solved! This accessory is very inexpensive (probably less that a replacement cable for your camera), easily and quickly available, and faster, easier, and with less camera battery drain than connecting your camera directly to your computer.<br>  If you are not sure exactly which card reader to buy, bring your camera with you when you buy it. The sales clerk will sell you the correct item.
7Zw1cEmPaa	All details are on their home page.
Xxviy63Paa	Just about anything released on pc can be controlled with a keyboard and a mouse. Besides that, any commercial game worth its salt will have configurable controls because there is no standard control system and if they don't, they will only make 10 percent of the people happy and the other 90 percent will hate the game.<br>  <br>  Even if you can't configure it to shooter controls, it should still work with a keyboard. It would go to the arrow keys, probably.<br>  <br>  If they sold action games with no keyboard controls on pc, they would sell even fewer copies than they do now.  You could do better with a gamepad though.
uDDQjLCKaa	It won't be able to read the microSDHC card. It's not possible.<br>  Unless of course, you have some external adapter that would somehow fit into the SD card slot, which probably doesn't exist.
RpCwfcRzaa	It stinks, but they're right. You 360 is not under warranty anymore and since it's not the RRoD, they won't fix it for free. You'll have to pay the money or try to fix it yourself.|`|VQlYhX6laa	DUDE MINE TOO!!! 100 dollars that crazy. i took mine 2 bestbuy and they told me it was defective . i bought a new one|`|nHyXr7Gcaa	fight
phuiDk0Baa	best way to do it without downloading any p2p file sharing software is with Google. you do this by using <br>  <br>  intitle:"index.of" (MP3) not my time<br>  <br>  where you the song "not my time" replace it with the name of the mp3 you wish to find. I've provided a link for you just in case you need more help doing it.|`|kIpDDVc9aa	You could try researching the title of that song and looking it up on LimeWire. If you aren't sure what LimeWire is, it's a little file-sharing program that allows you to download any kind of media file. Here's a link to LimeWire if you need it:<br>  <a href="http://www.limewire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.limewire.com/</a><br>  Just click "Download LimeWire" on the right side.|`|EKj4PH76aa	use <a href="http://www.File2HD.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.File2HD.com</a><br>  look up on youtube how it works.<br>  it's really easy to use, trust me.

3CJAUyqPaa	If you have the video in an iMovie project already and want it in a format that upload sites will take, under "File" slect "Share" or "Export" (it depends on the version of iMovie you are using). Typically, there is an "easy" way... pick the QuickTime selection and whether you want to do a large (better quality) or small (worse quality) file... As you learn to use this, you can expand to the Expert settings and get into MP4 for standard definition or if you recorded high definition video, you can use the h.264 compression. Vimeo.com has alot of good infomration on exprting file types - you can use the same video files you upload there to upload to YouTube and MySpace. I don't know about PhotoBucket - I am sure they have a list of acceptable file formats... follow their instructions. Read the FAQs.|`|TaxYLHbMaa	it should be drag and drop to imovie , this tutorial will assist you

MpQW0DNZaa	Something might be wrong with the av cable. try hooking up the dvd player to the tv in the same outlet the wii was in, then see if it's black and white. if not, call wii customer service. If you just bought the wii then you should have a warranty on it that the nintendo company will fix for free. If the dvd player or vcr or what ever is in black and white as well,  then something must be wrong with your tv's av outlet. If it's just the wii that's black and white try replacing the av cord by buying one from the store. Again, if none of this works, call nintendo customer service.|`|jKc7aDCwaa	She might also just have the TV set to the wrong input.

Let them know when the calls are coming in and that your girlfriend is being harassed.  Since it is her account, she will have to call.  She should also get a notebook and log when the calls happen and then contact the telephone company with her log.  They will track the information on their end and that will help her with filing a police report to stop the harassment and possible criminal prosecution.

Their service area is small to non existent, and they're still a start up company. <br>  <br>  The people behind the counters aren't going to do anything but have a good story about the prick that came in and yelled at them over something they couldn't do anything about. (That being the signal you're getting.)<br>  <br>  The people at the counter are doing a job to get a check. (They above anyone probably know how crappy their service is.) THEIR bosses are the ones you need to complain to. The higher ups. <br>   <br>  As far as the stuff with your payments, I can't speak to that.

Just because you can do everything, it doesn't mean it will be cheaper. Instead, in the long run, ti will cost you an arm and a leg as you will be forced in filling your GoPhone card all the time, also because there is NO option for internet/email/messaging available for the GoPhone (the only two available are Data 1MB and Data 100MB (think it this way, by the time you browse for 10 minutes, send a few emails with attachments, use some applications that require internet connection, you will be well over the 100MB limit and will have to pay the extra MBs)<br>  <br>  As you can see, there is no advantage in going with your GoPhone card instead of a Month To Month contract.

j5Apt8hWaa	The reason you are getting dark photos is because you are under exposing the sensor .. you need to use the meter if you want to shoot in the manual mode.<br>  <br>  Until you can take the time to learn how to use the meter, use aperture priority with the lens wide open and then you be able to shoot at the highest possible shutter speed, but it will not be 1/4000th of a second unless you have the ISO set high and you are shooting in bright sun<br>  <br>  Using the sunny 16 rule the base exposure in bright sun is 1/ISO at f/16.  With your ISO set at 400 ISO you can shoot your camera in bright sun at 1/4000th at between f/5.6 and f/4|`|i5OVORXgaa	There isn't enough light coming into the camera... you need to learn how to meter!|`|tHjBr4L4aa	OMG!  A shutterspeed of 1/4000 is only used in extremely brightly light situations.  Why are you choosing that speed?<br>  <br>  For starters, take a couple of shots in P (programmed) and review the images to see what shutterspeeds & apertures the camera has chosen.  From there, vary the settings in either A (aperture priority) or S (shutterspeed priority) and see how that affects your pictures.<br>  <br>  Only then, would I recommend using M (manual), as that's the realm of experience.<br>  <br>  It's like taking a manual transmission car and driving in 1st gear, then wondering why the car's so slow.  Learn when and how to adjust your camera, but use the camera's metering to guide your initial efforts.
AbRfd29Haa	Pro.. no, you're going to spend over $3000 for anything remotely "pro" and HD, unless you find a good deal on a used unit. <br>  <br>  Good consumer HD camcorders -- real camcorders -- can be had for as low as $400-ish. Here are a couple... cheap 'cause they're older models. I can absolutely recommend the Canon HV20... I have the HV10, which has the same sensor chip, and it's damn near the quality of my pro-market Sony HDV camcorder, particularly in bright light. <br>  <a href="http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camcorder/Canon/HV20+REF/41151729.aspx?navid=155438146" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camcorder/Ca...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camcorder/JVC/GZHD10US+REF/43353121.aspx?navid=155438146" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camcorder/JV...</a><br>  <br>  There are a bunch of cheap, Chinese-made "camcorders"... these are really all the same basic idea as the Flip.. fixed, tiny plastic lens, etc. They typically use a digital still camera chip and sensor, rather than real camcorder parts, because they're cheaper. This is just about anything made by Aiptek, DXG, Mustek, Insignia, VuPoint, Cobra, Jazz, iSonic, or any odd brand no one's heard of before. Some claim "HD"... they nearly always mean 1280x720/30p... "baby HD", not full 1440x1080/60i-24p (or better), as you'd have on the Canon. They compress too much, they don't have good lenses or a real zoom, etc. I can't recommend any of these, but you can certainly buy one in the $100 range, if not one of the "HD" models for under $100. <br>  <br>  Far as real camcorders new goes, the cheapest I've seen in awhile is this one: <a href="http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camcorder/JVC/GZMS100RUS+REF/43353130.aspx?navid=155441514" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camcorder/JV...</a><br>  For $149, this is nothing special, but it's MUCH better than either of those -- it's got a real lens with actual optical zoom, and yet, just as easy if you're targeting YouTube. me no one heard of before last weekend. A good clue... look for the lens. If you see glass where you think the lens ought to be, that's a good sign... better still if you see at least 1/2" of glass there. If you see something that looks like a pinhole surrounded by plastic, you might wonder how the light gets in. <br>  <br>  Oh, here's another low-cost "real" camcorder, a Samsung, with 34x zoom, flash-based recording, and of course, standard def sensor: <br>  <a href="http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camcorder/Samsung/SCMX10C+SLV+REF/43272073.aspx?navid=155438146" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camcorder/Sa...</a><br>  <br>  Another option, if you're not too picky, is buying a digital still camera with a good video mode. These will more or less resemble the Chinese-style "camcorder" models in recording issues, but offer far better lenses. Audio is often not-so-good, so you have to keep in mind how important audio is. My company has done short videos using a Canon camera with MJPEG recording, and it definitely rivalled standard def consumer camcorders in quality. I have a Panasonic DMC-TZ5, which is out of your price range, but does a passing shot at 720p (1280x720), though it's a bit noisy and low-rez compared to a real camcorder, but at least I have a good lens with zoom on that (and two HDV camcorders... sometimes I use this as a "C" camcorder, and only use the audio for synchronization purposes). Some examples of those with decent video (but read below):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camera/Kodak/V1003B+REF+SLVR/39330701.aspx?navid=155441514" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camera/Kodak...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camera/Kodak/1585462/40504983.aspx?navid=155441514" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camera/Kodak...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camera/Samsung/L200+BLACK+REF/43335652.aspx?navid=155441514" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecost.com/Detail/Camera/Samsu...</a><br>  <br>  Check into a digital still camera carefully.. not all of them can zoom or autofocus when used in video mode, though it's fairly common among newer models.|`|0NVypgGSaa	jazz elite HDV178 HI- definition video camera less than $100. 3 months ago at walmart.video & picture ok.as a camera not good on moving subject.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	The cheapest HD cam that I found is Aiptek A-HD 720P 5MP CMOS High Definition Camcorder for $110 but I'm not sure about quality.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UO796Y?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000UO796Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UO7...</a><br>  The cheapest for well known brand like Canon is $599<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D172421%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fn%255F2%26bbn%3D110770011%26qid%3D1235191987%26rnid%3D172421%26rh%3Dn%253A502394%252Cn%253A172421%252Cn%253A110770011&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|sX3paKxBaa	haha
3pMVVZ3Taa	If you are wanting a dongle to attach to the phone to give it bluetooth capabilities, no. As far as I have heard there is no connector made to give phones bluetooth functions. You can buy bluetooth transmitters to enable stereo bluetooth. These plug into a standard size headphone jack, or ipod and transmit to a separate headset, which is sometimes packaged with the transmitter, as far as I have seen these do not include mic connections, to transmit and receive. Many newer phones have built in bluetooth, and are commonly  including A2DP stereo capabilities

qvl3PjdEaa	It is either the GPU. But then if that were the case you would get the RROD because that would register as a hardware failure. So my only idea is that either the AV or HDMI port is broken, whatever it is you have, or the cable is damaged.    Either way you will have to ring Xbox Customer Support local to your area - it is free - and tell them what is wrong with your Xbox. The chances are they will ask if you would like it repaired and then they will ask how you want your shipping labels. Posted or e-mailed. Best to pick e-mailed. Print the labels off and get a plain box and put your Xbox in it. Seal it up nice an tight and put the Shipping labels on well. Clear tape is suggested and a lot of it, to prevent them from being torn off.    Sorry to hear your Xbox is playing up. My 2nd Xbox messed up for the 4th and final time the other day and I have had to buy an Xbox Elite.    My suggestion to all is that if you get a new Xbox, if you wait a month or so nearly all stock (hopefully) will consist of the Jasper Motherboard Xbox 360's. Both GPU and CPU of that Motherboard are 65nm. The ampage and voltage of the PSU (Power Supply Unit) is less as well and obviously less power = less heat. The chance of RROD with these consoles are obviously massively lowered.    Good Luck with your Xbox.

WAOkgdj6aa	Both people whom answered this question are wrong.<br>  <br>  Do NOT buy an intercooler for your Xbox 360. For many reasons. First of all I'd like to say that it does NOT void your warranty even if you did buy it. The only thing that voids your warranty is opening your console(that does not include taking off your faceplate) Anyway.. The intercoolers are a waste of money. What they do to work is take power directly from your 360 to cool itself. So how would that work at all? Well it doesn't, to be blunt. It makes your Xbox 360 work harder, use more power, and in turn, make it more hot. There are SOME coolers that run on an AC Adapter (where you plug it into the wall) however... these fans are not very powerful to begin with you'd be better off using your hand to fan down your Xbox 360. Second of all... Xbox 360's are not as bad as they used to be. Microsoft just released a new chip set, called Jasper, into all their Xbox 360 Pro's that pretty much 100% fixed all the overheating and red-ringing problems for the consoles. So I wouldn't worry about your console breaking. Just make sure you buy your console from a place that hasn't had them sitting there for awhile and havent had a chance to bring the new ones in with the chipset in them. You want to get it at a place that has a high turn around rate for consoles and gets them shipped quite frequently to make sure the Jasper chip is in them.... like a Wal-mart or a Gamestop. Anyway, so when you do get your console and you play for a few hours, you will notice that it will start to get a little warm.. however... if you notice.. being on your computer for a few hours, or charging a cell phone for an hour or so.. it gets warm as well. It's nothing to be worried about, it's normal.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|SUg8XyeEaa	Nah don't get it. For one thing it uses the 360's own power supply and therefore heats it up even more. Some cases reported of their intercooler melting onto the 360 because both became too hot. My advise: improvise, use a regular fan and aim it at your 360. Or sit it next to one of those vents on the floor if you have one of those (with A/C on of course). Or something like that.<br>  And some types of intercoolers do void the 360's warranty because of the way they had to be attached, along with the melting problems.|`|bDtwiBpZaa	Dont, Its Exspensive, Hard to Install, Is Loud And Actually.. Makes youre Xbox 360 Worse!<br>  <br>  They Dont Help At all. Just Take Care of Youre Xbox 360 And It Should be Fine.<br>  <br>  Hope i Helped.|`|q6uyloYdaa	You don't NEED to, but it can be helpful. To warn, intercoolers are very loud, and the 360 is already loud by itself. I would suggest getting a play & charge kit because it keeps the system's fan running even while it's turned off. Intercoolers turn off when the system does, and when the system turns off the internal temperature jumps because the fan stops.|`|py25T599aa	no it voids warranty

AbRfd29Haa	There are lots of possibilities. For example, the bomb could have a sufficient charge stored in a second battery or capacitor to detonate, and it could monitor the battery connection, and go off as soon as the battery is removed (or dies, for that matter). <br>  <br>  I always wonder why they don't just disconnect the explosives... but of course, you might use sensing to tell when that first block of C4 is disconnected, and set off the rest soon as that happens. <br>  <br>  Of course, the big difference between Hollywood bombs and real ones is simple: Hollywood bombs have to look good on camera. They have to be difficult to defuse... I'll bet plenty of real ones are not at all complicated --- they're built by lunatics, not electronics wizards, and they go off because no one finds them. But for a movie, you need the dramatic tension set up by finding the bomb and watching McGuyver or McGruber or whoever disarm it. <br>  <br>  And of course, they have to be something you can disarm (well, 'cept in the McGruber case)... so any real clever trigger can't be used either, or it would be set off as soon as the got near, opened the box, shook it, whatever.|`|GciEf2uWaa	No the modern bomb maker of today cannot defuse by simply removing the power in fact it triggers the detonation,the bomb squad that difuses it have many things to consider they have a list of makers profile by the type of mechanism that the bombmaker uses and they start from this idea to know what procedure to follow in diffusing it.|`|swzWHBzxaa	Good question but I don't really know.

Xxviy63Paa	Don't count on Sony to put any worthwhile ps1 games in the store. So far they offer you mostly turds like Jet Moto 1, Jet Moto 2, Cool Boarders, wipeout, about as many of the dumbest and oldest ps1 games there ever were with the worst graphics too. Jet Moto is awful (I bought it sight unseen, terrible game)<br>  <br>  There's a few good ones, the original warhawk, and I guess a few people like that castlevania title and crash bandicoot. But the good games like, say, oddworld, tomb raider, medal of honor, army men 3d, they don't put them there. Since resident evil 2 and 3 are very popular titles, they won't sell them there either.<br>  <br>  The Euro store gets better ps1 games than us. They have the entire Command and Conquer series! Lots of other cool stuff too. Not resident evil though. If you don't  have a euro account, you should check it out.

jKc7aDCwaa	No, the only thing that works in the Wii's USB ports are the Wii USB LAN Adapter, keyboards, and stuff that solely uses power, like charging stations. You need something that'll provide a Wifi connection to the Wii, such as the Nintendo Wi-fi Adapter (plugged into a Windows machine, but it's been discontinued) or a wireless router, or a wired connection to the Wii USB LAN Adapter. You may also be able to get a wireless router that'll accept a USB Adapter like the ones at your link, but your best bet is to ask Sprint about those, as routers are pretty finicky when it comes to accepting/supporting them.

8Q62Aia0aa	you can use the pa system to record with its just not as good as a full mixer most pa's only have a line out instead of all channel outputs like a mixer so u can record everyone at once into 1 track but then its hard to edit or u can record each person separately onto separate tracks and edit them however u want and still use ur pa for practice Krystal audio works great for me and its free i just wish i had a mixer to record multiple tracks at a time and edit them all

AbRfd29Haa	Have you tried TiVo's highest quality for your recordings? SD TiVos take in analog video and compress it in MPEG-2, on the fly. That's why you have a quality setting. At the lowest quality.. yeah, it's not going to look good, particularly on a nice HDTV. <br>  <br>  Ensure you do what you can to get a good recording.. use the higher quality modes for things that matter. Make sure you run an S-Video signal to the input, that'll look better than Composite. Any noisy channel is going to look BAD on TiVo... that's MPEG, it's just not designed to compress a poor quality signal. <br>  <br>  Do you have other standard-def sources? How do they look? All HDTVs have video upscalers, which convert SD to HD, de-interlace (at least on many types), etc. Not all upscalers work great, particularly if you have an older or lower cost model, it may just not do a good job on standard def video. Compare your TiVo to some other analog SD input... that'll tell you if it's the TV or the TiVo at fault. <br>  <br>  Realize also that, over time, your brain will adjust. Analog video, over the air NTSC, VHS, etc. is pretty miserable stuff... but most of us have watched it long enough for our brains to be pretty good at ignoring the ugly stuff -- that's how we manage to enjoy the good stuff. The same is true of digital noise.. anything with compression will have the potential for digital compression artifacts, which looks like noise in the analog sense, only a different kind. If your TiVo is new, you're not used to that kind of noise yet, so it's bothing you. In a few months, you'll still see it, but you'll be less bothered by it. <br>  <br>  Of course, SD-TiVo is doing well if it looks as good as the SD input you feed it... you're never getting an HD or even DVD quality output from it.|`|VYywucN8aa	I moved my sd tivo to my bedroom tv and got a tivo hd.<br>  <br>  also dont keep tivo in 4x3 on your 16x9 tv it would course uneven wear on your tv.
73t6LfrDaa	You have a couple of options for getting into the Guitar Hero world. You can pick up the whole Guitar Hero: World Tour package for $169.99 (PS3, PS2, XBox 360) or $189.99 (WII) at your local Game Crazy. If the higher price tag is a bit intimidating, you can buy into GH:WT at the much more friendly price of $99.99 (All Systems) for the Game and Guitar.<br>  <br>  If you choose to pick up the GH3: Legends of Rock bundle with the guitar and game, you can rest assured that the GH3 Kramer guitar will work with GH:WT. You can pick up a copy of GH:WT for around $59.99.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions, let me know. I work for Game Crazy, so I can throw together a price quote for you if you are interested in picking up any of these items used from your local store.|`|WAOkgdj6aa	Get Rock band.<br>  <br>  Guitar Hero World Tour is garbage, the songs are dated and extremely terrible. Also, the drums are 100% broken right out of the box and 70% of the time the guitar is broken as well. <br>  <br>  Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock is pretty fun.. but it's also old.. It's a nice fun game to get started but if you want all around entertainment and better songs.. Rock Band is definitely the way to go. The guitar isn't very good on Rock Band to be honest... but if you are playing it on a PS3 or Xbox 360 you can use the GH Guitar. The songs are much better on Rock Band and you will seriously notice. Also, you can download songs off your PSN store or XboxLive Marketplace for Rock Band that are actually pretty decent. What I would suggest you do is buy Rock Band (just the game) and buy the Guitar Hero Guitar seperately (first party one, not a crappy third party garbage company one). Then if you want to play the drums, purchase the drum set for RB later on when the price goes down (89.99 for the drums seperately).<br>  <br>  Hope all that makes sense.|`|w4XbSuB5aa	Alright if u do have enough money by the legends of rock bundle and the world tour disc, legends of rock is a really great and challenging game and u'd get good at guitar hero if u stuck with number 3.

2wLZSeozaa	The Wii is fun if you have a family you want to become close to and get active.<br>  <br>  In the same sense, it's a great party machine.<br>  <br>  However.. you mentioned that you will not be using it in a social context and for that I tell you that you will not enjoy the Wii at all. I know I'm in a similar situation and honestly NEVER touch my Wii unless I have people over. There are some very fun, single player titles that are worth getting it for like Super Mario Galaxy, Twilight Princess and Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles.. but that's it.<br>  Most games that are popular on the Wii are very repetitive. They are fun for about an hour and then you start to realize that it would be better to play with friends or it becomes very boring, very fast.<br>  <br>  The games you mentioned.. I'll explain why it's not worth it.<br>  <br>  Wii Sports: Wii Sports is a nice friendly game that gets you used to the console. It's neat to play around with the motion controls. However.. after you play the **** out of all the games after maybe an hour or 2 hours.. you will notice it's -extremely- repetitive and boring. The only real fun in Wii Sports after that is in a party scene... but like you said, you would be playing in single player mostly.<br>  <br>  Wii Fit: My god, I can't stand Wii Fit. The Peripheral (the balance board) is the only thing worth getting the Wii Fit for because it is used for other games.. however.. the game itself "wii fit" is TERRIBLE! The title is completely misleading as it does not even help you get "fit". Wii Fit is based on working on your balance with simple little mini games that are fun for about 10 minutes at a time. All the -good- games are all locked at the beginning anyway and you have to go through all the garbage ones a million times till you get enough points to unlock the good ones. Don't get me wrong, there are some really good yoga poses/strength training exercises that are very efficient.. but you never know which ones you should do! The game doesn't tell you! It gives you absolutely NO structured work out plan and leaves you hanging as to what you should do. instead, you are sitting there picking your nose as to what you should do.... and because it doesn't chose what you should do, you end up completely skipping the poses and going to the mini games that don't help you exercise at all. Also, loading into the exercises takes at least 2 minutes as you have to step off the board, and recalibrate it every single time... which is quite a hassle when you want a solid 30 minute work out. The Wii Fit is not something you are going to turn on every day and say "I want exercise today, time for my work out!" because it's not like that at all. You're better off buying a yoga/exercise DVD where they actually show you what to do to burn your fat off because it would work a lot better.<br>  <br>  Big Brain Academy: If you've ever heard of Brain Age for the DS... it's very similar to that. However.. I never really understood why these games are so popular because all they do is give you a bunch of crappy math problems and simple puzzles that you can do in flash games on the internet for free. If you want to help exercise your brain.. try picking up a crossword puzzle book or try an online IQ test to make you think.. It is very useless to be doing this on the Wii when it is limited and does not work that well anyway in comparison to doing it online for free.<br>  <br>  Like I said, Wii games are very repetitive and become very boring, very fast and if you are not going to be social with it, it will literally collect dust in your living room.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions feel free to post additional information and I can help with any other questions you may have.|`|wStPZeEEaa	if your playing the PS3 then im going to guess you play games like:<br>  Call of Duty,Metal Gear Solid 4 and Grand Theft Auto....as much as i love playing on the Wii its more of a family game then those kind...|`|C90bta8Saa	funnest game ever!! especially if you have a company over|`|EpvHhbByaa	I'd say based on your love for conventional gaming, there's no reason to say yes, there aren't many games on the wii for you. <br>  Wait a few months when Madworld and The Conduit come out.

The only real fun in Wii Sports after that is in a party scene... but like you said, you would be playing in single player mostly.<br>  <br>  Wii Fit: My god, I can't stand Wii Fit. The Peripheral (the balance board) is the only thing worth getting the Wii Fit for because it is used for other games.. however.. the game itself "wii fit" is TERRIBLE! The title is completely misleading as it does not even help you get "fit". Wii Fit is based on working on your balance with simple little mini games that are fun for about 10 minutes at a time. All the -good- games are all locked at the beginning anyway and you have to go through all the garbage ones a million times till you get enough points to unlock the good ones. Don't get me wrong, there are some really good yoga poses/strength training exercises that are very efficient.. but you never know which ones you should do! The game doesn't tell you! It gives you absolutely NO structured work out plan and leaves you hanging as to what you should do. instead, you are sitting there picking your nose as to what you should do.... and because it doesn't chose what you should do, you end up completely skipping the poses and going to the mini games that don't help you exercise at all. Also, loading into the exercises takes at least 2 minutes as you have to step off the board, and recalibrate it every single time... which is quite a hassle when you want a solid 30 minute work out. The Wii Fit is not something you are going to turn on every day and say "I want exercise today, time for my work out!" because it's not like that at all. You're better off buying a yoga/exercise DVD where they actually show you what to do to burn your fat off because it would work a lot better.<br>  <br>  Big Brain Academy: If you've ever heard of Brain Age for the DS... it's very similar to that. However.. I never really understood why these games are so popular because all they do is give you a bunch of crappy math problems and simple puzzles that you can do in flash games on the internet for free. If you want to help exercise your brain.. try picking up a crossword puzzle book or try an online IQ test to make you think.. It is very useless to be doing this on the Wii when it is limited and does not work that well anyway in comparison to doing it online for free.<br>  <br>  Like I said, Wii games are very repetitive and become very boring, very fast and if you are not going to be social with it, it will literally collect dust in your living room.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions feel free to post additional information and I can help with any other questions you may have.|`|y2yh4AUpaa	I got a Wii, i played it for like 2 weeks non-stop and i finally got bored of it, my Wii is now located in the top of my closet and hasn't been played in um.... a month now and I'm  13 years old and it only entertained me for 2-3 weeks i don't really know about a grown up though|`|W9xYnDMCaa	r u running tight on money?,,,,if so naw shawty. if you aren't and u like playing vidoe games and stuff then ye. :)
73t6LfrDaa	I am not sure what would be causing this to happen with your PS3, but there are a few things you can try to do to fix the issue. If you remove the game from your PS3 and then power it down completely by switching the power switch in the back to off and then back on, you can follow these steps to have your PS3 auto-detect your video output.<br>  <br>  With your PS3 in stand-by (power switch on in the back and the power light red in the front), press and hold your finger on the power button of the PS3. You will hear an initial beep with the system powering on. You will want to keep your finger held down until you hear a second beep. Once you do, you can take your finger off the touch panel and turn on one of your controllers to reconfigure your system.<br>  <br>  What this does is instructs your PS3 to reset to initial display configuration and allows you to reconfigure your system to play on your television. This is really useful if you go from using the HDMI port on a Hi-Def TV to the composite/component on a Standard-Def TV. If that doesn't work, I would try giving Sony's support line a call as your system may still be under warranty through them, however, you will need a copy of your receipt for them to service your console if it is under warranty.
HBNx77BBaa	All you can do is leave it somewhere to dry for a couple of days. Take out the batteries and the memory card and leave any flaps open that can be opened. Don't put it near a direct source of heat. It would have been best not to have turned it on when it got wet, but it may still dry out and start to work again.

j5Apt8hWaa	You cannot do that with but a very few DSLR's  The D40 is not one of them.  No a $450 camera is the least expensive DSLR available.  The D3, D3x, D90, D300 and D700 are the only Nikon's that have live view available.  The least expensive DSLR with live view is the Nikon D90, $1000 without lens.<br>  <br>  That said, why would you want to hold a two pound camera at arm's length?  It can only introduce blur caused by camera movement.<br>  <br>  You have a fine camera, but to use it, you will have to use it the same way the pros do.  The camera held to your eye, looking through the eye piece, using the focus screen and view finder to control the composition and light meter.<br>  <br>  Live view is only valuable when it is attached to a telescope or microscope or when using it in a studio to shoot table tops of products ... while attached to a tripod.  The LCD on DSLR's was never intended to be used as a P&S camera.<br>  <br>  The next time you see some pros shooting an event or game, look how they hold their cameras ... they hold their camera up to their face with the left hand holding the lens to control the zoom and with the right hand on the right side of the camera with their finger on the shutter release.  This is the most stable way to hold a DSLR when shooting any subject, especially moving ones, if using a monopod or tripod is not necessary or helpful|`|i5OVORXgaa	It's not defective... the feature that you're looking for is called "Live View" which the older DSLR's do not have.<br>  <br>  I'm actually a little surprised when people go out and buy DSLR's and discover that they don't have live view when they get home... did you try out the camera at the store before you bought it? Always a good idea!|`|tHjBr4L4aa	Neither the D40 nor the D80 has the Liveview feature you're asking for.  <br>  <br>  Trust me, the only current Nikons that have that are the D90, D300, D700, D3, and D3x.  The other models are not designed to use the lcd screen as a focusing and composing tool, and only allow you to review the images captured, and see the settings you've chosen.<br>  <br>  This is another reason every consumer should try out cameras and other equipment before purchase.  That way, you know exactly what to expect and won't be disappointed by features that your device doesn't have.
VSiMrZkOaa	I had a Blackberry Pearl before I upgraded to my IPhone, and the only time you need the data plan is if you want to use the internet (which basically the point of getting the phone) the girl that worked at the at&t store said you need the data plan to text, but I recently gave my dad the phone and he didn't get the data plan for it and there was no price change or extrachargess on our bill(he doesn't use the internet, he just texts). But as far as the service goes, I have been with them for 4 years, and I have nothing bad to say about the service, I love them and I don't think I would switch to a different network!
PoRpYU5caa	All you have to do is download the song.<br>  Drag the finished file to what ever program you use ex: windows media player real player etc. <br>  <br>  the file should copy into your library. edit the title <br>  and sync it just like any other song you would sync<br>  <br>  that's it!!<br>  <br>  that same exact thing can be done with iPod's too<br>  <br>  (:|`|DtS7Al6Maa	Start using <a href="http://deggz.com/" rel="nofollow">http://deggz.com/</a>|`|07bX5jGsaa	What I do is click on the song I want to put on, then click it again and hold 3 seconds after the first time you clicked it, and drag it over to whatever music player you use for the mp3 player, then sync the mp3 player and it shouyld be on there. You'll have to decrease the width of the Frostwire menu and make sure whatever music player you use is to the left of the frostwire window so you can drag it over to it. You have to drag it into the library, and it doesn't always go through, so check every now and then.|`|L8iI0Ocraa	it depends on your type of mp3 player. what you have to do is <br>  (1) look at one of the songs in your frostwire library<br>  (2) where it says "path" on the guideline tab. (you know how it says name;size;type and so...)<br>  (3)follow what it says. so like if it says /local_disk c./ programs/ frostwire/ and so on.... That means open "my computer" and click on what it says. follow each folder it says. and you'll find the music files.<br>  (4)then open your mp3 file and click on the song you want, hold it down and drag it over to the folder of your mp3.<br>  <br>  That should do it. I hope it helps.

j5Apt8hWaa	P&S cameras are primarily still cameras with a primitive video feature .. which was never designed to shoot high quality video's  For that you will need a real camcorder ... plan on spending around $300 for a base mini-DV camcorder.<br>  <br>  To use your fine L4 to video tape your games, you will just have to experiment using the camera on a tripod and using the various video options ... once you have used them all, you will know which will provide you the best quality for YouTube<br>  <br>  Here are you options, try both.  640 x 480, 320 x 240, 15 fps.  The best will be at 640 x 480 @ 15 fps.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The best resolution and frame rate your L4 records movies in, is 640x480 @ only 15fps, so you may find your movies are a little jumpy.<br>  <br>  You're not really going to be able to improve on that quality other than upgrading to a camera which records better quality video.<br>  <br>  Your options for better quality are to either buy a video camera (camcorder/handycam) or a new digital camera. For a digital camera, look for one which records in at least 640x480 @ 30fps. Some brands are better than others. Also, some newer models are now able to record movies in a higher resolution such as HD or Full HD @ 30fps...and You Tube now allows HD quality movies, which really do look better.

557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	First lets clear up one thing.  There are no AA rechargeable lithium batteries for consumer use.  Yes there are lithium ion rechargeable battery packs but they come in odd sizes and not standard AA size batteries.  That is because lithium ion batteries need specific chargers and can self destruct in the wrong charger.      So what you are probably looking for is NiMH or nickel metal hydride batteries.  Both Energizer and Duracell make excellent rechageable batteries.  I have noticed Duracell has also started marketing a rechargeable that is Pre-Charged.  Why is that a good thing?  Those pre-charged batteries hold their charge much longer than the standard NiMH battery.  I used to use standard NiMH batteries but found that I needed to keep charging them up even though I wasn't using them because they self discharged too fast.  These pre-charged batteries ( and Duracell isn't the only manufacturer - Sanyo makes Eneloop batteries that are the same type) mean I charge up the batteries and don't worry about them.  Although the capacity isn't as high, if you aren't using batteries as soon as they are charged you loose capacity anyways.|`|9AL1xFhlaa	through my usage of AA batteries (And i use a lot) i always found Energizer to last longer on normal batteries however i personally would go get a Energizer recharge stand that holds like 8 Batteries at one time.

rJ8kLGgkaa	FIrst, "Legal" Sounds is not legal, either in Russia or in the US.  The most risky thing is that you are giving your credit card number, address, email address, etc. to a Russian company, located in Russia.  They could keep this information, or sell it to scam artists. <br>  <br>  They also want you to download special software onto your computer.  Any time you download and execute software from a risky source, you risk infections with viruses or key loggers.  Not saying this company will do this, but a key logger could take everything you type and send it back to Russia.   (Scammers are looking for bank account numbers and passwords).<br>  <br>  Whatever they do with your infomation, you have no legal recourse.  Also, remember also that you have to give them a $25 minimum to open an account.  To get the song price down to 9c each, you will need to download 270 songs from their website.  <br>  <br>  Definitely do not take this risk with somebody else's (a parent's!) credit card.<br>  <br>  The money you pay will go directly into the pockets of the Russian owners.  Nothing will go to support your favorite artists or their record companies.  See the link below, scroll down a bit to the communication with the RIAA.<br>  <br>  If you feel songs are too expensive thru I-tunes, Amazon, etc, you might as well learn about torrent sites, download the songs for free, and not risk giving away your personal information and credit card number.  I'm not suggesting you do either, just pointing out that downloading from legalsounds or from torrent sites is equally illegal, but one is less risky.<br>  <br>  Here's who you are dealing with (note the server location):<br>  legalsounds.com Owner: LegalMedia, Russian Federation, Chajanova 14/10 str 2, Moscow, Moscow | Server location: Russian Federation|`|HPPVtn8Maa	My whole answer is going off what the site actually says.<br>  <br>  But in terms of being able to use it on your Ipod, it says its legal as long as you use it only in a private Sense. Like listening to it on the iPod.<br>  <br>  The program is always being monitored by the admins to ensure safe files for transfer. Thus meaning no viruses for malicious programs.<br>  <br>  You WILL be able to transfer your purchased songs into iTunes. Once you have downloaded your song, open your iTunes program and then go up to (select file) then click add folder to iTunes Library. Select the location of your downloaded music files and click Ok button.<br>  <br>  Your downloaded music will be under your "My Music" folder by default.<br>  <br>  As far as the album art goes, it don't say if it transfers with the song or not. It does say however that if you want a high quality album art to use amazon and save the album art image then same to the MP3 file.

Zd0yuyGlaa	Your best bet is to play with a wired connection. You will still get lag, periodically, but your chances of getting lag will be significantly decreased.<br>  <br>  On a side note, different games will lag differently. The main cause of lag is the connection between your console and the host's. If you are playing with a wired connection, you will either not get lag at all or very lightly. If the other person  you are playing with is on the other side of the world from where you are, then lag is pretty much guarunteed and it is a question of how bad. <br>  <br>  In short, an Ethernet cable is the best way to go unless you're console is one or more rooms away from your router in which case a wireless adapter is advisable. Otherwise....stick with the Ethernet cable. <br>  <br>  But no, I would suggest playing with an Ethernet cable.|`|y1D0N34Saa	Wired is ALWAYS more reliable but technology with routers has come pretty far if you buy a good router you really won't notice..But wired will always be better.|`|PUDwOYjTaa	i would say wired connection because there are less issues when you're on xbox live.|`|VlmN3TLeaa	Its better to play with wired ethernet cable bcuz u wont lag alot..|`|3b5AOCZFaa	Wired is definitely better in terms of connection and its probably even cheaper, but i gotta say that i use wireless and i haven't had any troubles with it at all. You can try using it from your computer, i'm not sure if that will work or not but if it doesn't i would use wireless. The Wireless-G adapter is only $50 on Amazon with free shipping. It is incredibly reliable and easy to setup, you'll be playing live in no time. Ethernet, like i said, has a better connection most likely since its direct, but choose the option better suited for your situation, which sounds like it to me, wireless.
pTqD7qsAaa	I know Olympus has 2 models for shockproof and waterproof.  <br>  <br>  1) Stylus 1030.  It has very tough body and good picture.  Shockproof up 6.6 feet and waterproof up to 33 feet and also freeze proof.<br>  <br>  2)Stylus 1050.  This one replace the Stylus 1030 and this cost a little bit more.  1050 doesn't have tough looking body but still do the same job.  Shockproof only to 5 feet and waterproof up to 10 feet.  <br>  <br>  Amazon has it for really cheap<br>  Here is the link to the Stylus 1030s<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235203117/ref=sr_kk_1?ie=UTF8&search-alias=aps&field-keywords=stylus%201030" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235203117/r...</a><br>  <br>  Here is the link to Stylus 1050s<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235203256/ref=sr_kk_1?ie=UTF8&search-alias=aps&field-keywords=stylus%201050" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235203256/r...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Yes,olympus is a good brand.For more reviews <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D502394%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fn%255F1%26keywords%3Dolympus%26bbn%3D281052%26qid%3D1235195394%26rnid%3D502394%26rh%3Dn%253A502394%252Ck%253Aolympus%252Cn%253A281052&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|j5Apt8hWaa	They are very good, but expensive.  Not as expensive as replacing a camera every few months because you drop it from time to time on the ground or into fluids.|`|6nmdvdEraa	Yes they are excellent cameras, but take heed of the water depth limit advised by the manufacturer. Mine was borrowed by some *^#@* who decide to snorkle to the bottom of the deep blue sea with it. Have a new one now & keep it hidden|`|TaxYLHbMaa	olympus is a good brand , and the shock factor is always a plus. good buy I think
Ngjpf1uJaa	when you have your refill card and you put in the code and get the money on your account, it automatically subtracts a dollar a day from you account.|`|lJAaBmlyaa	You do have to be 18 to have a cell phone with T-Mobile even if it's prepaid. As far as the dollar a day plan it unlimited mobile to mobile and nights after 7 for a dollar for the days you use it. Other than that it's .20 a min.|`|QZSLlAaDaa	What you can do is just go to a t-mobile store and buy a prepaid SIM card. They're like 30 bucks I think, then look around online like on ebay or something (or a used phone store) and you can probably find a used sidekick pretty cheap.<br>  You can buy the "minutes" cards at Walmart anywhere from $25 for 250 minutes, $50 for 500 min. and $100 for 1000 min. (at least somewhere close to that)<br>  I don't think there's an age requirement.
