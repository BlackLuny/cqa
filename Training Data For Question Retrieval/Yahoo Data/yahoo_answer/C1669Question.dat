20090128152659AARP4R8	Travel;Italy;Other - Italy	Travel Itinerary for North-ish Italy - Milan, Bologna, Verona, Venice?	I'm going inter railing and was going to spend a lot of time in Italy, because I just have this fascination for the country. But because euro=pound, It's costing me a fortune so I have to cut back. I'm trying to fit these cities in in about 6-7 days if possible. For a first timer, any suggestions how many days I should spend in these cities and what all I should do. I really want to get a feel of each city you know and not just do all the tourist things by the book (i.e. visiting certain museums and gardens etc). I want to see the real city if possible, try the cheap local street food, which in my eyes is always the best. (maybe you can tell me a good place to eat?) Considering that in mind - could you help me out ? :)    I've heard there isn't MUCH to see in Milan.. It's just expensive! Venice is expensive but beautiful at the same time.   Also any idea what my budget should be - breaking it into accommodation, food and entertainment if possible.   I've worked so hard this year saving up money and I really want to just go and enjoy.. :) those of you in my place and feel you need a break too after the rough year that's gone by, feel free to join me or even organise a little trip for yourself over a weekend      Thank You

Also, I can only speak English, though I will try to learn some Dutch before getting there. Would this be a problem while I'm in Utrecht and Gouda?       Thanks in advance!

In Canada, you don't need turnpikes and expressways and tons of highways, you just have Transcanada Highway, Highway 2, Highway 3, 401, Autoroute 20,  and a few small roads.      Should the USA eliminate its interstate highways and build fewer roads down South so it's like the mirror image of Canada???  So like if you want to go down to New Orleans or Houston, you have to take a small airplane from a gateway city in the north???      So then if you want to go to Florida or Texas or Southern California, it will be harder to get there by road, just like it's not easy to drive into Arctic Canada from Toronto, same thing????       Do Canadians think this would be a good idea for USA to save money and eliminate manmade structures and pavement? If Canada were in charge of USA for a day, would they propose this plan???

20090128162623AAlCcaS	Travel;Mexico;Other - Mexico	Back again....Mexico trip need some help narrowing down location and setting up trip. ?	I posted a similar question last year but didn't get to go through it with the trip. I'm back at it again. This time I am starting the planning and $ saving early! What I need to know is DETAILED info. 1.) Location-unsure which area I want to go to..not automatically Cancun perhaps other places such as Puerto Vallarta, Los Cabos or where ever. 2) Pricing- I am not trying to spend an arm and a leg but I do know it will cost a bit I am trying to stay below 850$ total for airline hotel transportation food shopping all that! I know they have a good deal somewhere 3.) Date of trip--not sure. Perhaps spring break (Apr 10-17) or during summer time when no school is taking place..I want a time when weather is nice and there is a good bit of tourist but not too much also when the pricing is better 4.) Travel agent? Website? I don't know where to start..I been browsing travelzoo and cheapcaribbean.com  so I am not sure what is the better option or options to go through...       I plan on going with a group of female friends ages 21-25. Activities not so much into scuba diving(can't swim) or snorkeling although will TRY so places that offer that can be included. Clubs, Shopping is the major thing---especially for myself. I want to find inexpensive replica items and other bargains...Beach is a plus. Preferably pretty close walking distance to all these amenities..beach club shopping centers.       Inclusive or not inclusive? which is better      Take a taxi or bus or walk?       What to bring? MOney? Debit / Credit Cards?      Do I have to worry about being cheated out of money or theft?      Help! Thanks a lot in providing detailed info and also websites or guides for me to research

Hi all,      Will be in Washington DC for a few days at the end of March and while I'm there, the Washington Wizards are playing the Charlotte Bobcats on Wednesday 25th at the Verizon Center.      Should I get a ticket in advance and have it mailed to me(the mail delivery charge is almost twice that of the ticket itself!) or should I be able to pick up a ticket on the night?      Seems to be a reasonable amount still available right now but don't want to have it sell out if a big crowd is expected.      Thanks,   Brian.

Once there was a duck,   This duck could talk,   She said more than just quack, quack,   But they gave this Duck a badge,   People began to sigh,   That is how this Duck enevitabiliy died,   She just made a comment about J.B,   This stands for Jiffy Bags,   Not for a band,   Would hate for you -   To misunderstand,   So I think a troll killed her,   And ate her whole,   That duck was clever,   Witty and smart,   But Trolls are fugly,   They have no lives,   Cold and empty,   Friends they never find,      So do Trolls eat Ducks?

We are thinking of actually moving to the US in about 4 or 5 years time, we are keeping our options open though, we haven't really decided on what state we want to live in but Michigan is on the list.   At the moment our child will be 3 yr old when we travel in august and there will probably be another child by the time we are thinking of moving there, job wise we will be working in the medical/nursing so hospitals near by would be handy due to work.   So as the Q's says - where about in Michigan is good to live/work??   and also in Detroit??    Thanks in advance
