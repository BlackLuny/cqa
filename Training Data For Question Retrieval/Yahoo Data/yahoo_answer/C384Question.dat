We tried it day before yesterday and used the whole 27oz bottle on them!  They have been out side airing since then, but still REEK!  The mattresses are about 12 years old, but have never been slept on.  They look brand new, but they smell wretched.  Does anyone think professional upholstery cleaning might help?  Can any one help us think of something??? ANYTHING?!?!?!      We got them from a family friend and they were supposed to be my two year old son's new big boy bed!

20090220144419AA0CeJj	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How do I rotate a central home heater?	I bought a house that has a little bit of a code violation with the central heater. First the closet where it is located is stored in the master bedroom, and second the distance from the front of the heater to the door is less than the 7'' required by NM safety code.the dimensions of the heating closet are longer than they are wide. As i'm in the process of the remodel two separate plumbers have recommended that I either rotate the device and make the service door open into the hall, or purchase a newer central heater with smaller dimensions. I believe there are several possible issues with this - duct work, gas line, etc... A small bit of history on this problem is that the heater was retrofit into the house after an older style floor heater. Any ideas where i can get a better picture of how to accomplish this? What sort of heater I should look to replace my current model with? and possibly some good general reading so that I better understand the whole project?

20090220155818AAgciTe	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Fridge not cooling too well..?	So I have a Gorenje Pacific fridge/freezer and it is around 10 years old.  About 4 months ago it started to cool less effectively than usual.  The freezer worked fine but the fridge section definitely struggled to keep things cool.  I realized that the seal was losing contact in a couple of places and so had a guy replace them for me.  The fridge definitely benefited from the new seal but was still not operating at its usual full efficiency.  I bought a fridge thermometer and checked the temperature at various settings on the fridge thermostat (which ranges from 1 to 7).  No matter what number I turned the thermostat to, the temperature remained at a constant 10 degrees Celsius (50 Fahrenheit).  From what I can gather the ideal temperature should be around 4 degrees Cecilius (39 Fahrenheit).      Is it possible that the thermostat is stuck and if so is that something I can tinker with myself?        Perhaps there is there another explanation I am not thinking of?      Thanks for your help.      Pete.
