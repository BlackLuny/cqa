Can you check the logs on your router and see if it's disconnecting the 360 or if the 360 is taking itself out.  Also try the wired connection and see if the same happens.  Lastly try reserving an IP address for the 360 and then reconnect it so it obtains the new IP and see if that helps.|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm<br>  <a href="http://computer-network-problems.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://computer-network-problems.blogspo...</a>

I recommend going to this page: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.as...</a> . It teaches you HTML. Also, it's a good idea to practice your skills on a Freewebs.com site. Make sure you don't use their templates. When you think you know all you need to know about HTML and can code a webpage OK, next you could think about getting a sub-domain or buying a domain. One.com have some good offers at the moment. Then you can learn PHP! It may seem like a lot but it is really easy to learn!|`|xetVyGOdaa	Sensible question, those sites are rubbish. To make a website you need to buy a domain name (www.whatever.com - couple of quid a year), then some web hosting (couple of quid a month), build some web pages (free) and upload them (free). You can build web pages using a free text editor such as Microsoft notepad (start>all programs>accessories) and would need to learn html & css, which are easy enough. Alternatively you could buy some wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) software to build the pages, such as Dreamweaver (but the first option is better and will help your site).<br>  <br>  See <a href="http://www.freewebtutorial.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebtutorial.co.uk</a> for more help.|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	I had a website for three years using Freewebs.com the basic you get for free isn't that great but if you pay the lowest rate you can make a great website without having any real knowledge. <br>  I would highly recommend it|`|cWA40Medaa	by real , i assume you mean a first level domain and an independent web space.<br>  In most cases you can't get a domain for free except there are some promotions to give free domains sometimes. so you have to buy a domain from an ISP like name.com or godaddy.com.<br>  a free space is always available on the internet though it takes time to find one, you can try athost.net or you can just buy a cheap one from godaddy,lunarpages or hostmonster,ususally it costs no more than $5 a month to have a big enough space.After the purchasing,you will be given the nameservers of  your space and you can change your domain's NS to them in your domain control panel which means after several ours you can get to youy space by using your domain.<br>  making a website is not so easy if you want to really "make" one as sophisticated as blogspot,but you can use some free blog scripts written by others .In the control panel of your space, you can find what is called Fantastico ,just follow the wizard you can install say, a wordpress blog which is very popular and here is one example:<a href="http://www.hostgust.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hostgust.com/</a>|`|jeMNcPPYaa	I think it is a good idea for each family to have their own domain, this gives you unlimited email addresses (because you own the name), it means that no person in the family is tied to the ISP (the people you connect to the internet through. You do not have to live in the same house, I gave my family in UK and America email addresses, means they can chop and change ISP to get the best prices and service, without losing their email address.<br>  <br>  So here is the list in a decent order.<br>  <br>  1. Get a domain name. A UK domain costs about ￡9 for two years. You then renew it after that every two years to keep it.  In emails the domain is everything after the '@', so if you chose mydomain.org.uk<br>  Then your website is www.mydomain.org.uk and your emails are 'anything@mydomain.org.uk'<br>  <br>  Think avout the name carefull, here are some pointers,<br>    You are wanting a name that can last a lifetime.<br>    Do not give you're real name away in the domain, it is too big a clue for hackers.<br>    Also, think of a name that all ages and tastes in the family can use.<br>  <br>  Remember, that though I will be talking of hosting in a moment, the domain name belongs to You. You can keep it and move it as you see fit (usually there is a year agreement with each host).<br>  <br>  2. A host. This is where you host your domain, it is the place where access to web pages is given to you and your visitors. It is also where your email server is. There are two host types, UNIX/Linux or Windows. The majority of the Internet (including Microsoft's own) are on UNIX/Linux servers. These have a great stability record and pretty much unhackable (so long as the host has not been stupid with settings). You will also find UNIX/Linux is a great deal cheaper than a Windows host.<br>  <br>  3. Selecting a host. Hosts all offer a list for each product set that they offer. The list tells you things like how much space you can use on their server, how much bandwidth (every visit uses some of your allocated bandwidth).<br>  For a business these would be huge, also if your own website suddenly became the next Yahoo, with millions of visitors per day. But for home users it can be very small.<br>  So go for the cheapest, if you do create a new Yahoo, you can always upgrade as and when you need it.<br>  <br>  Most hosts offer a lot of software creation spplications, absolutely free. You may have seen joomla social sites or php-nuke, this is all free site creation software.<br>  <br>  Some links below, first is an example Domain regidtration site. But all hosts that I know of let you apply for your domain at the same time as you register.<br>  <br>  Then two hosts (to show I am not on their payroll) that I know are good because I have used them for myself and companies I have worked for.|`|8fdd380db386a532b840902de0f86756aa	The link below will help and it will not cost you anything to design, maintain etc a website.<br>  <a href="http://www.designvitality.com/blog/2007/10/25-open-source-web-design-programs-and-tools-you-should-already-know-about/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designvitality.com/blog/2007/...</a>|`|mT5JVBFAaa	Hope this helps = <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=how+to+make+a+real+website&btnG=Google+Search&meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=h...</a>|`|p5ItsTEsaa	you can get dream weaver this is software to make your own web site if you know anyone who has it then upload to INTERNET you can get free space and costs nothing great package for learning|`|3oanK9hkaa	I use Yahoo!

FEQMb7wIaa	Torrent files have a .torrent extension. .7z are zipped files. I would highly recommend getting rid of that file immediately. You don't know what's in it, simply because all you can read in your LimeWire browser is "xxx.7z." There could be a hundred viruses attached to that zip file. Stick to getting .torrent files instead, or at least a site where you can see what you're going to download.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	The dangers of Limewire and what has happened to my family   ______________________________________...  Not sure how many of you are aware of Limewire that kids are using to download free music on their computers. I knew very little and still don't know all that much but it is a terrible thing to have on your computer and I want to get the word out as to what happened to us. First off, Limewire is a computer program you can download for free. This program allows you to download free songs that are illegal. It is a file sharing program which means if you have limewire and someone else has limewire, those two people can share their songs (or whatever else they download) from one computer to the next. With this being said, I knew my DD had limewire on her computer but had no idea what else you can do with this program. Come to find out, you can download ANYTHING from this Limewire, as in X-rated photos, child porn, videos ...etc.    A week ago we were woke up with 10 FBI men, 1 FBI woman and 1 sherriff banging on our door at 6 am. They had their FBI vests on, wore guns, etc. I answered the door and they asked me who was in the house, etc. They woke my DH and 2 teenagers up and we were told they had a search warrant. They had reason to believe we had someone in our house who had downloaded "something" illegal on one of our computers. We were all in shock, it felt like something out of a bad movie. They searched our house for 2 hours and they took all of our computers to investigate. I pray they don't find anything. DH and both kids have said they have done nothing wrong, I have not either. We have consulted an attorney and now we wait.    I tell you all this to educate others to get limewire off your computers. Its not worth all this for free songs ...|`|QhxWu4F4aa	.7z is the extension for a file compressed by 7-Zip, an open source compression program.    You can download it here (http://www.7-zip.org/ ). Install it and use it to unzip the file. It's completely free.    Torrent files, by the way, have the extension ".torrent", and can be opened with programs such as Torrent. Torrent files are just small bits of information that tell a compatible program what to download.    As I side note, I strongly recommend that you discontinue use of Limewire, especially if you use it to get music, movies, programs, and the like "for free". It is, in fact, not free; it is illegal, and the chances that you'll get caught are slowly growing.    Worse, many files obtained through Limewire contain malware, and Limewire itself opens many network ports, which can let malware run haywire and slow your computer down if it gets the chance.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i just want to say one thing...jimobasa2 is full of BS, there is no FBI in UK lmao (i know u live in UK, i saw ur previous question, idiot)|`|aXC7elejaa	You should use uTorrent for torrents.

Use:  www.piratebay.com    for torrents. And use  www.utorrent.com   for a torrent downloader.      But @ the guy above me.  Thats such BS. The companies have no way of tracking a torrent, especially on limewire. Even if they did, they might have ONE person call you. 10 FBI agents is bull, they only send out that many if there is an armed suspect or something dangerous. Even if they really were there, theres no way that they would let you use your computer or phone.  Stop making up fake stories just to scare people, it's pathetic.|`|HKtUMVoqaa	.7z it`s a compressed file, you just have to decompress it, download 7zip, and done.

It prints the same as when I use originals as I have found ink that matches almost exactly the original in colour.  All I do is take the plug out of the hole that I drilled and fill the syringe with ink and place the plug back on then re-chip and replace.  Can be messy I'll agree but as long as you wear latex gloves and cover the area you are working in there should be no problem. Lexmark beware of refilling as they don't usually work with refills.  Epson also beware off unless you have a chip re-setter as they want work with anything other than either originals or re-chipped compatibles or re-set chips on the originals.  I have been refilling for 5 years and I have to say there is a lot of nonsense talked about it ruining the printer. Print head block with originals so where is the evidence that refills only cause this?  I would say try it and make sure that the ink you buy is specifically designed for the make and model of printer.  If its only black they that should not be too bad, its colour ink that you have to be a bit more selective about.

xtnzs27daa	OK, you mentioned that you'd just reinstalled XP due to some sort of failure. After reinstalling XP it is common not to have the correct or any drivers for some pieces of hardware.    So first, check to see if you have a driver installed for your sound device, do this by going:    Start > Right Click on My Computer > Properties > Hardware Tab > Device Manager.    Once there find the sound device that is not functioning correctly. It will mostly likely be under sound, video and gaming controllers. If there is a problem with it, it will have an ! mark by it.    Right Click on it and click 'update driver'. Navigate the menus to select the location of the updated driver.  ______________________________________...    Depending on your hardware you may be able to find a driver:    A. On the manufacturers website  B. On a install disc that came with your hardware  C. Google sound drivers - A company like Realtek might have a driver that is compatible with your hardware.

d57260040ef184f107856d79c51106c6aa	Good question.<br>  This answer will be over-simplified, but it should answer your question.<br>  A "file name" consists of 2 parts, the file name and the extension.<br>  The part before the period, or dot, is called the file name and the part after the dot is called the extension. The file name part can be almost anything, but the extension is the part that tells your PC which program to use to open the file. For example: "MyCar.jpeg" would be a picture file. The .jpeg tells your PC to use your picture viewer application associated with .jpeg files to open the file. If you change the extension part of the whole name, your PC won't know which application to use to open the file. You can change any or all of the part that comes before the dot.<br>  If you can't see the extension part of the file name, you can do this...<br>  Open Windows Explorer (NOT Internet Explorer) and on the tool bar click on "Tools -> Folder Options -> View" and un-check the box that says "Hide extensions for known file types". (You can also get to this option by double clicking "My Computer")<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Troy Downing|`|4ce43bef9c856dde99d8f08242595b99aa	Are you renaming the file extension:<br>  <br>  Example:  OriginalFile.mp3     Renamed to OriginalFile.txt<br>  <br>  If you rename the extension, the file will become disasociated with it's program.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you may want to check the permissions on the drive.  You may be logged in as Admin but Admin may not have permissions to the drive.<br>  <br>  Also, I've had issues like this where the ACL gets hosed ( most often when dealing with MACs storing files on my windows servers ).

5XavPJJ1aa	The Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 will be your best bet for running games as there is no game out there (so far) that utilizes all four cores of the processor. so i suggest you get the core 2 duo instead of the quad core...  Also the graphics card has a a part in making the game run better. Be sure to get the best graphics card out there!|`|QhxWu4F4aa	I like AMD's 64-bit CPUs. :-)    Keep strongly in mind that even the best CPU can't make up for a poor graphics card, slow RAM, and the like.|`|LsIMKcHcaa	E8400 is better for gaming|`|cLzxtmpCaa	the second one|`|dTVMq4VPaa	The E8400 is the best plus it's only 65Watts.

If you have a laptop, sometimes there is a built-in mic, but it doesn't sound like you have one, so you might want to look into computer headsets.  You can get good ones @ Wal-Mart for cheap, but you have to look around.  Then, there should be a microphone jack somewhere on your computer.  Hook your headset or microphone up to that, and you should be ready to go.  You may have to go into "Advanced Settings" in AIM and look around a little bit to change to your mic, but it isn't that hard to figure out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

WVAd2l7Xaa	Honestly I don't think the RAM matters. It's probably just a selling point that some manufacturers often use. I would suggest doing further research into it.<br>  <br>  You will unlikely see a performance difference going from 4GB to 8GB of RAM. If anything, I would guess you could see a 10% increase in performance, but assuming your machine is already a monster, you won't notice the difference.|`|XsIuoM6daa	The Certified SLI-Ready Memory label is one that Nvidia gives to memory that has been tested to be stable in an SLI-enabled system. Further, the memory will be stable in certain overclocking scenarios.<br>  <br>  On all SDRAMs, there is a small chip called the Serial Presence Detect or SPD. That chip lets the BIOS query the memory at boot time for a profile that includes things such as size, chip organization, voltage ranges and bus speed. That's how the BIOS knows a particular SDRAM is a 2GB part intended to be (effectively) run at 800 MHz on the memory bus with 4-4-4-8-T1 timings at 1.8 Volts for example. Generally, you can override many of those settings manually in the BIOS, but when set to AUTO, whatever the SPD returns is what will be used. (There are many articles on what the timings mean. Try <a href="http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=873" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?a...</a> for one.)<br>  <br>  With Certified SLI-Ready Memory, the SPD may contain "enhanced performance" profiles (EPPs). A Certified SLI-Ready motherboard's BIOS is free to read and use the enhanced profiles that may have more aggressive timings (say 4-3-3-6-T1 timings with a 960 MHz on the memory bus and at 2.1 volts to continue the example above). You could always do this same thing using the manual settings on most motherboards, but the EPP removes some of the guesswork. The manufacturer has tested the memory to work at the enhanced settings. Think of it as overclocking for dummies. Chances are good, however, that you could do even better manually. It depends on how much you want to learn and how much you like to tweak.<br>  <br>  That said, if you look at <a href="http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone_build_mem.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone_bu...</a> (a great starting for point SLI systems, btw), it lists memory modules that have passed certification. Note that in all cases, the number of memory modules is two (in dual-channel mode as a single bank of memory). I assume there is some issue in maintaining the bandwidth when switching between the two banks, but I've never really come across any support for why two memory modules in one bank is the only configuration certified. That doesn't mean you can't use two banks of two (i.e., four [or more] SDRAMs), but there may be a performance penalty paid.<br>  <br>  Assuming you are thinking of going from 4 GB to 8 GB for improving games, you will only see a difference if you were running out of physical RAM with only 4 GB. That's unlikely, but if you like having Word, Outlook, Internet Explorer, and Media Player all running while you are playing a game, you might see an improvement. Or, you could just close the open apps so that the total memory requirements when the game is running stays under the 4 GB physical memory limit. What you want to avoid is hitting the physical limit and causing some portions of memory to be temporarily swapped to disk to make room for other portions. With 4GB, you really shouldn't be having an issue. (All bets are off in a couple years. Remember, having 2GB of RAM was overkill a couple years ago.)

If it is plug ed in and still not showing up then look at step 2  2. the drivers are not loaded. check by  right click on my computer  click properties   hardware tab  device manager button and if you see any that have a yellow question mark then the driver is not there otherwise you can click on the network adapters and try to reinstall the driver if not thing shows up for the item ither yellow or there correctly then go to step 3  3. this could be a setting that has gotten changed in the systems bios  reboot and hit ither f2 or Del key varies on different machines could also be f10 in rare cases look under the tabs until you find built in Lan or on board Lan and see if it is enabled. if it is if that is working then you  might have a bad NIC which in most cases would mean a motherboard would need to be replaced or a usb nic or PCIE card would be needed.|`|AA11690976	Goto ur motherboards vendor website     and download the correct drivers for the wlan !!!    in device manager, u can see what drvers ur missing   as each device without drivers will have a yellow " !

The best you can do is to limit his access to the Internet.  If he uses computers away from the house, ground him.  If he has a computer in his room, take it away.  Set it up in a public area in your house (in a family room, give him no privacy)|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	You could try to send an email to the hotmail people explaining the problem or just try to find out!|`|aEmdURPTaa	I don't think there is anything you can do about this, apart from restraining his access to the Internet at home.

Firefox is an internet browser, just like Internet Explorer is an internet browser. The reason why Firefox was suggested is because it has add ons that can help protect you from hackers, spy ware, ad ware and other malicious programs by blocking them.     A firewall and Firefox are to completely different things that aren't even related. But both can help protect your computer.|`|QhxWu4F4aa	Firefox is a web browser; it serves the same main purpose as Internet Explorer.

Don't however make the mistake a lot of people do of thinking because Firefox is safer you can do without an Anti Virus. Always have an anti virus installed no matter how safe the browser is. (AVG or AVAST are good ones and are free)|`|b8tgCAQJaa	No!    A firewall is a piece of security software designed to prevent unauthorised traffic passing to, or from, the Internet. It can protect against hack attempts, and can also help to prevent rogue pieces of software (such as viruses or spyware) from accessing the Internet.    Firefox is a web browser, similar to Internet Explorer but it's much better - it's more secure, has more features, and protects your online privacy better.    What a firewall and Firefox have in common is that together they'll make your Internet browsing experience much safer.

meqrA9ZZaa	I'm not shure that I understand completely. You have changed to OpenDNS and now you want to go back to using your ISP's DNS?    Well, you have entered the OpenDNS IPs as part of a configuration somewhere, just clear those fields and you will be back to your providers DNS as soon as you disconnect and reconnect.    By the way, to my best knowledge OpenDNS should let you visit any website. Are you shure OpenDNS is the problem?|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You need a DNS server - openDNS is probably one of the best.  But if you don't want that one, use the one your provider provides - just call tech support and ask them to talk you through setting it up.  (I don't think there's a website that can be gotten to that you can't get to by using openDNS.)|`|kfGzOdReaa	Short of being a network geek, you probably havent ever considered toying with the DNS settings in yout Network Preference Pane. But OpenDNS has given everyone a reason to take another look.    DNS stands for Domain Name System, and its employed all over our beloved Internets. As a quickie explanation for those who dont already know, it goes something like this:  Each website you visit is - at its most basic level - identified by an IP address. DNS servers make it possible to link that IP address to a more easily remembered address such as theappleblog.com.    Ok, so thats basically it. There are default DNS servers that our computers and the wireless routers that we may be using in our homes use. But if you go into the TCP/IP tab of your Network Preferences Pane, you may see that you can optionally add different DNS servers that your system may default to. This is where OpenDNS comes into play.    Sign yourself up for a free account and run through their extremely simple (OS X specific) setup procedure and youre ready to rock. Ok, so youre probably asking why youd switch to this optional OpenDNS for your settings when the defaults has clearly worked without any issue. Fair enough. From their website:    OpenDNS is safer    OpenDNS is faster    OpenDNS is smarter    OpenDNS is more reliable    Ummmm, so what?  Well by safer they mean that they provide an extra layer of Phishing protection, which prevents the bad guys from fooling you into thinking theyre ebay, when theyre really not.  By faster theyre referring to their larger than normal internet caches running on their own, high speed network. They use MySpace as an example of loading much faster once you move to their dns servers  By smarter they mean that you can add keywords (and then some) to domain names you visit frequently.  And by more reliable, well, I think thats just market-speak personally.    But the most interesting part is the way you can add keywords to domains you visit on a regular basis. You may be thinking that you can already do that in your browsers bookmarking system. True enough, but doing it through OpenDNS allows you to set it once and then use those keywords in whichever browser youre using this week - you wont have to go and re-setup those keywords in each place. Better yet, you can add the OpenDNS settings to your wireless router and have those keywords available in any browser on any computer within your network. Sweeeet.    And then how about one step further with keywords? You can even add parameters to your keywords. So the most obvious might be Google. If you create a keyword for Google.com, of say, g, you can then assign it to accept parameters so that g theappleblog will bring up this page.    Ive only just started playing with OpenDNS, but its clearly got some interesting things to offer. Its free, and the instructions are very simple to follow. If this stuff sounds interesting, I suggest you give it a try for yourself.
g4Dxlklxaa	Actually i haad a similar problem last night. <br>  <br>  One thing you MIGHT be able to do is use the Recovery disks and boot up from another source, such as a USB drive. <br>  <br>  When the computer is booting, hit the Setup menu key... It's either F2 or F3... It will display a simple menu and select the item that refers to Boot up source.  If you have access to a working external disk drive, you might be able to put the Recovery disks in there and have the computer boot up from the USB. Good luck!!!|`|3LHsCLVFaa	The recovery will not run correctly from the external position. But this would be a good time to run chkdsk /? while it is in the external enclosure.

Then put the drive back and see what happens.|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	it sounds like you ton virus's? I think you can restore it but the main problem wont go away??

If not you might have to fork out a couple of bucks
SkpRC2Nmaa	Where does that happens exactly
B9W5v7zhaa	I would assume that you don't have enough memory. Also laptops usually have shared memory for video graphics. When you edit a video you use a lot of physical and video memory. Your laptop probably can't handle it|`|dILqe7nBaa	it may be getting hot> clean fan and vents with canned air and use on hard flat surface with good air flow|`|H5iVq0fwaa	sounds like either a virus or a an overheating problem.<br>  <br>  virus - clean it, or do reformat/ reinstall windows.<br>  <br>  overheating - have it cleaned from a service center. accumulated dusts can cause it.|`|NAznDakQaa	It sounds like your laptop is overheating from the load of editing videos. When you edit videos in increases the load on the computer to a high level, that causes it to get hot. <br>  <br>  Next time you are editing video, put the laptop on a desk, and raise it up using four decks of card, or similar items. This is increase airflow to the computer and help prevent it from overheating.
JcqB8VfLaa	Don't use that CRAP! lol, there is better stuff for free which take much less in resources. Go to cnet.com and download avast for free. It's beautiful, you can use it while you are working and it's much better. Norton is so 7 years ago, it's crap now.<br>  <br>  Also get yourself some spybot search and destroy there too for free. It is great and taking out spyware and protecting your computer in real time, as does the avast anti virus. They are 2 different types of programs which compliment each other very well.<br>  <br>  Ohh, can't access internet. <br>  <br>  Go in on safe mode and clean out your temp files. Then do a search for internet explorer and get one without add ons which will probably be able to get on the net.<br>  <br>  Malware bytes is the best to take out what you probably have, which may be vendo virus which only malware bytes gets to in my experience. <br>  <br>  Norton probably won't even help what you have. You can get spybot I think on a disk and it's cheap because on line it's free.<br>  <br>  After you get on line and get some room to work, put on firefox browser, it's free and they don't have as much to target it yet. Explorer is a nightmare and hackers target it more because they hate it.<br>  <br>  A trick I use to clean out temp files is to unplug the internet, restart, then get to the control panel and internet options and delete temp files.<br>  <br>  You can also do a search and find your prefetch folder. Empty that before you shut down every time when you are having real issues and the programs which are getting you will be removed and can't jump right on at start up.|`|bH1OnSoNaa	hey dude...u purchased that....

ZCrIKWlQaa	I think you need to plug your bluetooth adapter into the laptop (i.e. a bluetooth dongle).  If the adapter is built in, then you need to turn it on, and then pair your phone to it.  Bluetooth is a wireless connection, so you don't need to plug your phone into the laptop.<br>  <br>  Your cell phone has a built-in bluetooth device.  If your computer does not also have this, you need a dongle.  I got mine on amazon.com for less than $1.  There are many different types, but the link below shows the one I got, and it works well.  All you do is install the software included with the dongle, then you can connect anything with a bluetooth connection.  I also got a pair of bluetooth headphones that can connect to my PC or my cell phone to listen to music wirelessly.

3tuwWidiaa	I've had this happen to me and I'm a professional techie.<br>  <br>  If it won't turn on, it is quite likely that it's fried.  However, before we pronounce it dead, here's some things to do.<br>  <br>  (1) Unplug it.  Immediately.<br>  <br>  (2) Open it so that you can place it upside down, which will let any excess liquid drip out.  Be careful when doing this, as you don't want to place too much pressure on the hinge.<br>  <br>  (3) Let it sit (put a towel under it) for 3 or 4 days.<br>  <br>  (4) Plug it in and try to turn it on.<br>  <br>  If nothing happens, no even the power light, then it's toast and you'll need a professional repair.<br>  <br>  If you get a power light, but other things aren't working, then it might still be recoverable.<br>  <br>  If it works, you will need to have your BF or a pro open it up to clean the keyboard, since it'll be rather sticky.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but getting liquid into the computer (how do you know the motherboard didn't get wet?) can destroy it.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Spilling liquid over a keyboard usually means the end of your computer because delicate parts inside that should be kept dry have been unexpectedly made damp or even wet.

An install that was produced in one month will not work under a key for another, an install that was distributed as OEM will not work with a key from a retail disk.<br>  <br>  So, just borrow your friends disk and see if it takes the key. If it does, you can try copying it (it may or may not work...) to have it on hand, but you shouldn't need it.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work, call microsoft.

l9aXZ3poaa	I would suggest trying Dell.  Every machine is custom-built, which means that you can avoid spending money on stuff you don't need and instead spend it on things you DO want.<br>  <br>  For example, it seems like you don't exactly need top-of-the-range graphics - so you wouldn't want to be buying the highest spec graphics chipset.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would play around with the configurator on the Dell website and then call them when you have an idea of what you want.  I have always found the telesales guys there pretty good.<br>  <br>  The one downside is that given your graduation timeline you probably want to buy this pretty much immediately, and Dell might take ten days or so to send it to you.<br>  <br>  Whatever you buy, make sure that the warranty conditions don't require you to send the thing away for days on end if there is a problem.

You don't have a snowman.  You have a cookie cutter that can make one.<br>  The snowman is a class, and the cookie  dough is memory.<br>  <br>  Now, as soon as you take the cookie cutter and press it to the dough, you have a snow man.  That is instantiation.  The snowman cookie, is an instance of the class of snowman, and each snowman you create with the cookie cutter is a different instance.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Creating one.

It has it's own state information.<br>  <br>  Make sense?|`|AA11480348	You don't instantiate an object. An object is the result of instantiating a class i.e. allocating the space in memory for the object to exist, using the definition of the class.|`|75nbESJUaa	An Object is from a blueprint we call a class.

The class "apples" is an abstract notion of an object; it is not an object itself. So, to say "I like Apples" is a reference to no object in particular, but rather the abstract notion of what an apple is.<br>  <br>  To say "I like this apple", you are referring to an object. The object is of the class apple, but it has it's own properties as defined by that class (size, color, tartness...all that).<br>  <br>  When you instantiate an object in programming, you are creating an object from the class. You are then defining specific properties in it, for that object. You can instantiate many apples:<br>  <br>  "I like this apple, I hate that apple". Now you have two objects, of the same class, with different definitions for their specific properties.<br>  <br>  In an object oriented language, it'd look like this:<br>  <br>  Apple a = new Apple();<br>  Apple b = new Apple();<br>  <br>  a and b are both of the same class, but are separate instances if the class.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Basically you are giving birth to an "instance" of that object within your runtime application space.<br>  <br>  Although you may have written a class - you can't actually use it until you declare it's existence to your program at runtime.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	Instructing the operating system (through code) to allocate memory for the object in question.<br>  <br>  A C# example would be:<br>  <br>  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();<br>  <br>  The 'new' keyword is the instruction...allocating memory.

If this is what you mean and you are going to do a leaflet type publication of however many pages, fold physical sheets first and number the pages because the order in which you place text etc onto the computer will not be in the same order!  Anyhow if this is what you mean, up to Arrange, Layout, set your margins to say, 1cm all round then click on grid and set columns to 2 with spacing of 2cm and 2 rows and place tick in box alongside centre guides.  This just gives you guides as to the divisions. You can then draw text frame to fit the first blue column and the third. The middle is purely for the fold.

Restart Windows XP in Safe Mode.<br>  4. Delete WgaTray.exe from c:\Windows\System32.<br>  5. Delete WgaTray.exe from c:\Windows\System32\dllcache.<br>  6. Lauch RegEdit.<br>  7. Browse to the following location:<br>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\<br>  Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify<br>  8. Delete the folder ‘WgaLogon’ and all its contents<br>  9. Reboot Windows XP.<br>  <br>  Note: With this method, you may be prompted to install WGA Notifications again which can still be unselected.<br>  <br>  Second Method<br>  <br>  Another alternative suggested by dman is by using System Restore to restore the PC to a previous restore point that WGA Notifications hasn’t kicked in, and then carefully stop KB905474 from been applied to the system. To use System Restore, go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> System Tools -> System Restore.<br>  <br>  Note: Again, you may be prompted again to install WGA Notification, so it must be bypassed.<br>  <br>  Third Method updated<br>  <br>  This method involves using a cracked version of LegitCheckControl.dll to replace the original copy of LegitCheckControl.dll, and thus bypass the WGA validation and make Microsoft believes that your copy of Windows is genuine. To get rid of WGA Notifications warning messages, the patched version of WgaLogon.dll and WgaTray.exe to replace the existing files.<br>  <br>  To apply the patch by replacing the files manually, try to end the respective processes in the Task Manager before deleting the existing files. Most likely is you will have to restart your PC in Safe Mode in order to replacing the original copy of LegitCheckControl.dll and related files. However, there has been automatic updater and even cracked WGA installer that automatically apply the patched version of WGA files.<br>  <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Re..." rel="nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Re...</a><br>  <br>  remove it with this program.|`|3tuwWidiaa	The tip off here is that she's being told to contact Microsoft to buy "the new one."<br>  <br>  What's happened, I think, is that this update including a program from Microsoft that checks to see if you have a legal copy of Windows.

wxOO8A8eaa	Reading the whole story I'd recommend you don't write anything and send a private message to him saying you're sorry
Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  1) Sharing<br>  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)<br>  <br>  2) Preview before you play<br>  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well. <br>  <br>  3) Virus Risks<br>  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for. <br>  <br>  4) Settings<br>  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:<br>  - Install<br>  - Select the folder<br>  - Select the quality<br>  - Download your songs<br>  <br>  5) Wider Variety of Music<br>  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.<br>  <br>  2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading<br>  <br>  3) No viruses.<br>  <br>  4) Preview before you play<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  n/a<br>  <br>  <br>  Limewire:<br>  Pros:<br>  - You can download free music<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - Everything else<br>  <br>  Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	You should support artists and online media by purchasing music from Amazon, Rhapsody - Itunes..<br>  <br>  And if you are going to steal it - at least try not to be so candid about your disregard for their media.|`|DaYqNCsNaa	I have a macbook pro too.

suu2KORBaa	Do you intend to host the sites yourself? Then see "virtual hosting"...|`|AA10401385	The short answer is 'yes'.  They can even share a machine.  Apache has a setting (configuration file) where the server responds based on what domain was asked for, rather than just sending a page.  Look up rewrite rules to find something like this:<br>  <br>  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} myfirstdomain.com<br>  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/folder1<br>  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ ga/$1 [L]<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  The deal with rewrites is that you're only matching the domain and they you send the request instead to a different location, so anytime someone sends a request for a page it's transformed behind the scenes (unless they're EXTREMELY nosey and inspect HTTP headers).  So it will work the same as if they were on two separate machines.|`|1dace0dd693841a58cc0d34b8403d7b8aa	This is very simply solved by the DNS records.<br>  <br>  Both fbpcs.org and fabbs.org can point to the same IP address (the same server).<br>  <br>  Then you have a single reception page that checks the incoming url (fbpcs.org or fabbs.org) and redirects to an appropriate virtual directory or do any other processing to differentiate between the sites.<br>  <br>  The original domain name will be retained on the address bar.<br>  <br>  Here's an example - dolph.w3.org and w3.org have the same IP address (128.30.52.45) so you will get to the same server with either address but notice you get a different result depending on the URL.<br>  <br>  [Additional: don't worry, both sites could even share the same pages but each page could render different content because it can tell what URL activated the page and act accordingly.  If you want to dynamically rewrite the URL then the server can issue a code 302 or you can do it via JavaScript.]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _

d57260040ef184f107856d79c51106c6aa	Now, that sounds like a homework question!<br>  What grade are you in?<br>  O-K, sorry. Good Question.<br>  Here you go...<br>  Let's say that your local grocery store receives a shipment of 1000 cans of "Chunky" soup. The clerk will scan the bar code on the soup can. The scanner is connected to a computer, which is connected to a network. Once the clerk has scanned the bar code, he will enter into the computer "1000 cans". So now the computer knows to add 1000 cans of Chunky soup to the store's inventory. The clerk might then type in the price that the store paid for each can of Chunky soup, maybe $1.98. He may also enter the price at which the store will sell each can of Chunky soup, say $2.15. So now the cans of Chunky soup are placed on the store's shelves for people to see and buy. Someone comes along and puts a can of Chunky soup in their shopping cart and takes it to the cash register to buy it. The Cashier will scan the bar code on the soup can which will add the selling price of the soup, $2.15,  to the customer's total. The scanner at the cashier's station is also conected to a computer, which is connected to the same network that the receiving clerk used to add the soup to the store's inventory. So once the sale is final and the customer pays for the soup, the cashier's computer removes one can of Chunky soup from the store's inventory. Another computer on the same network will make a record of the sale and will note the price that the store paid and the price at which it was sold to the customer, so a profit of 17 cents will be recorded. When most of the Chunky soup has been sold, the store manager can look at his or her computer, again connected to the same network, and the store manager can see that the store's inventory is down to 75 cans of Chunky soup, and that way she or he will know that it is time to order more Chunky soup for the store.<br>  <br>  See?<br>  Now put that in you own words and go do your homework!<br>  (Sorry, Just kidding.)<br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Troy Downing|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	as database LOL|`|eRWVOozHaa	Point of sale, Inventory, Display for advertising, Overhead paging, Voice over IP applications, Internet access for research, and of course for employee's to goof off and play solitaire since in this economy no one is buying anything.

This program basically will open hashes in the computer before booting the os to show the user name passwords. It (as far as i'm aware) cannot harm the computer. Be aware though that this is illegal and if a teacher finds out about it you'll probably get banned from the internet in school or worse. (And be aware that im not to be held responsible in any way if you get caught using it, once you download it it's your responsibility and if you screw up that's your fault) But here is the addy of the website. <a href="http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/download.php?type=livecd" rel="nofollow">http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/download...</a> Basically burn the thing you download to a disc and then insert it into the computer before booting the os from the HDD.

The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.<br>  <br>  There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.<br>  <br>  Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

G6VKUqZxaa	Windows hate's it when you turn it off while any programs are running. Its always best to properly turn it off. Easiest thing to do would be to unistall and than reinstall the audio drivers. They should be on a cd that came with your computer. Just pop in the cd and install the audio drivers than restart your computer.|`|jLL7sDILaa	Check to make sure nothing got muted. For some reason my old computer used to mute the speakers by itself. Try different places (like YouTube, iTunes, etc.) as sometimes only one program/site won't work. If it still has no sound, try attaching the speakers to a friend's computer. If it still doesn't work, they're most likely broken.

It's not much different than running an .exe file on your compuer or one that you receive in your email. <br>  <br>  If it is from a site that you trust fully, you can run them, if it's a shadey site, I would not install the ActiveX control. The problem with them is, it could be a virus that you're installing, or a buttload of spyware.|`|d52c423cc4bc1b4e6ee97ebd6e8f837eaa	Yes, because ActiveX controls can potentially install spyware and other bad stuff on your computer.  This could cause your computer to slow down, or do worse things that you might get blamed for.|`|eb52b82f91e2d3099d9b1814f55431d2aa	Yes you should, however the administrator will have likely blocked you from installing any unapproved controls using Group Policy.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't run unapproved controls because they might have an adverse effect on your system and may contain spyware/malware. One will likely not need an ActiveX control.|`|AA10592685	Some programs won't work if you don't download the active X components.  Know the programs you are downloading!|`|AA10010235	usually ... yes

AA11707728	The best protection isn't an antivirus program.  It's running your high risk applications (like your web browser) in a sandboxed environment.  This is a special emulator that intercepts everything the program does and, rather than allow it to actually make any changes to your system, those changes happen only in special files maintained by the sandbox program.  Delete the sandbox and it's like it never happened.<br>  <br>  This is an EXTREMELY effective method of preventing infiltration of your computer through websites programmed to infect your system.  Always run your web browser in the sandbox.  Always delete the sandbox afterward.  And it becomes nearly impossible for your computer to become infected.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandboxie.com</a><br>  <br>  Program is free for most uses.|`|2FAXWV6faa	Avira AntiVir<br>  - <a href="http://www.free-av.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-av.com</a><br>  ==or==<br>  Avast Home<br>  - <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a>|`|2OzNu8spaa	i'm using free trial of norton2009 now, its quite good only.. no infection to my pc since i started using it,bcoz it automatically blocks the suspicious sites and programs..|`|Fkcq73ioaa	Definetly Norton Antivirus<br>  <br>  I was on the McAfee but it was a load of poo.

Also to see if they have hidden embedded trojans,adware or malware.  <br>  <br>  Avast free for home use is I use an  excellent state of the art technology that is far superior then any other free or purchase program.   <a href="http://www.avast.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com</a>  (They are out of Prague).   <br>  <br>  They will ask you for your email address so they can send you a free key that is good for one year.  After one year you must request another free key.   Their corporte avast is the same, they just make corporate pay. <br>  <br>  I  have used this program for nine plus years an I never had one virus in my system.  It has an excellent realtime scanner in the background that is light years ahead of any one else with a background scanner.  If you open a webpage and there is a hidden virus of any kind the background scanner will come on and destroy the virus.  (Plus if you keep your speakers on you wil hear a male voice saying, "virus has just been destroyed".   Likewise for the daily updates that come in on an automatic basis twice or three times per day.  Scans all 180,000 objects in my system.  And when it removes a virus from a registry key you can be assured that it is no longer in your system.  <br>  <br>  If you want to spend money I use what the Government of China uses for antivirus program.  <a href="http://www.filseclab" rel="nofollow">http://www.filseclab</a>  (They are out of Beijing, China).  Both program are equal in my opinion on state of the art technology  This program is "Twister", you pay a one time fee for life. Includes all automatic updates, excellent support an all new versions.  (You will be hard pressed to find any one else who will give you this for a one time fee).  Avast I use in my backup pc.  <br>  <br>  Please note that you can only use one antivirus program, or you will have serious conflict with your system.  You can use three or four antispyware programs without conflict.  <br>  <br>  All of these programs that I am giving you are very low on resources.  They are nothing like Nortons or Mcafee junk an one big resource hogs.  <br>  <br>  For spyware,adware,malware and rogue dialers, (I use ADSL, but like the added protection for rogue dialers).,  Download from <a href="http://www.emsisoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.emsisoft.com</a>   This is an excellent company out of Austria.  They also will ask you for your email so they can send you the key for the free version.  I prefer the paid version, because it comes with an excellent backgroud scanner like "avast", and never will miss anyting.   The free A2Squared v2 for personal home use, does not come with the background scanner.   <br>  <br>  Another good free one I use is from Sweden.  <a href="http://www.lavasoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavasoft.com</a>   Download their free home personal versions Ad-Adware Se Personal.  This company has been around long before any one ever thought of antispyware.   <br>  <br>  Last of all there is a good program out of Prague that I also use, "Ewido Spyware". This is a purchased only version that becomes free after thirty days if you decide not to purchase they will remove the background guard and the automatic updates. You will have to update on a manual basis.  Also scans 175,000 objects in my system. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cyberhawk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberhawk.com</a>  is an excellent free program for “zero day attacks”. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sophos.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sophos.com</a>  Download their free rootkit protection.<br>  <br>  Clinical Psychiatrist, France|`|AA10592685	I like avast for now.|`|4661d36e7644df820ce5ee6b0e6046bfaa	although I don't have this program, I've heard of,  AVG,, and a program called AVAST anti spyware supposedly free! so try typing in, <a href="http://www.avgantivirus.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.avgantivirus.com</a> or http www so on so on avast.com then you should see 1 or more pages of sites,l look for the words free down load in the brief discrip. before you click on to the site...     good luck dude.|`|a0cc387d66029aad85ae2d8c4ee0d62baa	The best 2 I ever found was anti-vir and avast.

9e69114f630fc3a4f016dd297b420d47aa	According to my research, Firefox, and all of the Gecko-based browsers, need server privileges in order to communicate properly with their password manager module. The actual connection they need is with localhost -- the computer they are running on, in other words.<br>  <br>  I assume the messages you are getting are from your firewall, yes? WIthout knowing exactly which firewall you have, here's some general information:<br>  <br>  FIrefox, being a Web browser, of course needs to be able to access the Internet, and the "trusted zone" part refers to your computer (yes, you can use your browser to open local files ... I get lazy and use Fx as a quickie jpeg viewer!). The server part I just explained.<br>  <br>  I have no idea WHAT the person above me is talking about! I'm not too sure that he does either.|`|AA10592685	When you load fire fox or any others that want to act as servers or browsers and it asks if you want to make it your homepage just keep clicking no. and make sure the box that says they must ask permission remains checked.

You can recover from this.<br>  <br>  First off, stop using the Internet Explorer - download FireFox and never have these problems ever again.<br>  <br>  Secondly, download a whole mess of virus and security scanning products and sweep your system clean of all the viruses and trojans roaming around your system:<br>  <br>  Comodo Antivirus<br>  Comodo Firewall<br>  AVG Antivirus<br>  XoftSpy<br>  CounterSpy<br>  Outpost Firewall Pro<br>  Zone Alarm Firewall and Anti-Virus/Anti-Trojan<br>  AdAware<br>  <br>  Most of these programs are either available for free or have free trials available.

6bb237236a462bbed7c047b9afbc7f18aa	Depending on your router (if it's a linksys or dlink) the procedure will change, however, login to your router and you should be able to configure static DHCP addresses.  This means that your PC will still dynamically get its address and DNS information from the router, however, it will make sure you get the same thing everytime.<br>  <br>  Another option is to just static the PC.  So do an 'ipconfig /all' if this is windows and jot down the DNS information and default router.  Configure that info into your computer and turn off DHCP.  <br>  <br>  If you do this, you should choose something lower than .100 since most home routers tend to use .100+ for DHCP - or go in and change the range.<br>  <br>  As for why it changed, your lease probably timed out and something else snagged the .100 address.  If there are not multiple computers on your network, then you may want to make sure your wireless is secure since something was able to grab that .100.  You might want to try and ping it and see if it's around.|`|1518400d679185b02f0a404d7a26c784aa	Your DHCP lease expired on one computer (the one using .100) and another one grabbed it.<br>  <br>  The only way to be certain a computer is using a particular IP address is to assign a fixed IP addresses to  each computer by setting the desired address on each  computer.|`|7c09a12b9db9e2860ac0c8fa120be786aa	IP's are provided to you from your ISP provider, many companies regularly change them for you for security issues.

This will open your browser and tell you whether the port being used by soulseek is open or closed;<br>  if open you are done.<br>  if closed then click on the link below that closed message provided by soulseek to a webpage called portforward.com.

13b723f270d65c013797b5d13e3884adaa	like the first post says...for a build that will last the average user several years, it will generally be cheaper to build one from scratch.  You might have noticed on a dell or hp site where they offer low-end systems for about $399?

G0m2kONTaa	Instead of downgrading, I would look instead into getting additional memory for your PC.<br>  <br>  I bought a Dell PC over a year ago with Vista already on it, and yet the machine only had HALF the memory a PC needs to run Vista. As a result, it was rather slow (especially with loading up and closing down). I literally doubled my machine's memory and those slowness issues went away completely.<br>  <br>  But if you ultimately do downgrade, though, a clean format wipe and installation of XP is probably the easiest way to do it...|`|85dnSnVAaa	i am suggesting you to do format totally don't downgrade it because it may be cause problem in later time so make sure you start from stretch or if you got two partition you can install xp on other partition and it would run as normal when you start your computer you need to select either of operating system to run.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|l0i3W5f7aa	From what I've read in tech forums, its very difficult and not worth downgrading.

However, there's nothing stopping you from formatting the drive, and then doing a clean install of XP.<br>  <br>  Be sure to backup any data (documents, photos, etc.) from your drive first.<br>  <br>  Boot from XP, and have it format your hard drive.

J3t129deaa	You shouldn't be scared as the other user suggests. Upgrading laptop memory used to require removing the keyboard and taking the laptop apart to access the slots for the memory. Newer laptops, within the last few years now provide access to the RAM slots on the bottom of the laptop usually by unscrewing a plate. <br>  <br>  As the user suggests, ESD or electrostatic <br>  <br>  discharge<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostat...</a><br>  <br>  Can occur when you are working with electronics, and even small shocks can damage components. I would suggest touching the side of the case or something metal to release all of the static electricity that you might have. If you are really worried you can buy a static wrist strap and ground yourself to something. I have been fixing PCs for many years and I never wear one, so if you are careful you should be fine.<br>  <br>  To install the SODIMM memory please look at this guide:<br>  <a href="http://www.memorystock.com/how_to_install_laptop_memory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.memorystock.com/how_to_instal...</a>|`|YvtFiWT5aa	Yes you can. This module will fit your notebook:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820144183" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Swapping memory is pretty easy, and can be done by anyone with a screwdriver in 5-10 minutes. Most notebooks either have a little panel underneath with some sort of marking, or, less often, it will be under the keyboard or trim surrounding the keyboard. In this case you would just carefully pop off the trim (it snaps in), unscrew the keyboard (if necessary) and pop in the new ram. Once you've put the new ram in, start the machine and you're done!<br>  <br>  And don't listen to the paranoid people who say you'll kill your laptop with static. As long as you're not walking around with wool socks on shag carpet you'll be fine, just touch something metal before you start and there will be no worries. At the very worst, a static shock COULD kill the memory, but not the whole computer. Tons of people upgrade their memory without any precautions at all and never have a problem.|`|9Oydrexhaa	you can..if you know how to take of your keyboard and install it yourself. and also if you have a static charge in your hand and touch your computer and you get a shock, then you have just killed your computer.<br>  <br>  I do not recommend it|`|Pn5w08Q8aa	According to Crucial.com you can upgrade to 2 GB if you wish. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Aspire%205310" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.a...</a><br>  <br>  As far as ESD( Electrostatic discharge). It's good to be on the cautious side but don't be frightened. Just touch a bare metal part of the case or go touch a doorknob to release static and you should be fine. I've done it many times without a problem.|`|58BYcQDaaa	there is probably a pannel in the back of the laptop, to access ram, harddrive, and stuff like that<br>  thought you can always take it to the store, and have them put it in for you >.>

0Iyqf6Glaa	The first thing to consider when looking to upgrade from integrated to stand-alone video is what type of expansion bus your motherboard has.  If your motherboard has an appropriate expansion bus, then you can likely upgrade your graphics.<br>  <br>  Two common expansion buses which modern computers can present with for video upgrades are the AGP and PCI Express buses.<br>  <br>  Which free expansion slot(s) you have will dictate which type of card you can use.  There are also important distinctions within the families of expansion buses.<br>  <br>  The key thing to understand is that you need to research what card will work with your computer.  Ideas to get started include:<br>  <br>  1. open your case and check for free "expansion slots" then look for markings on the slots indicating what type they are (e.g. AGP, PCI, PCI-E).<br>  <br>  2. open your case and check for manufacturer/model identification on the motherboard; research the motherboard online to determine what type of expandability it offers and even which cards work with or are recommended for it.<br>  <br>  3. if you have a major-maker PC, you can likely get video upgrade options just by searching for video/graphics upgrade using your PC's model number.<br>  <br>  4. call the tech support line for the company who made the computer, they will be happy to recommend and try to sell you a graphics upgrade directly.  You don't need to buy directly from them (since their solution might be overpriced) but during the pitch you should be able to ascertain what options they know about.<br>  <br>  Hopefully some combination of the above can get you a good result.<br>  <br>  After you obtain your card, you would install it.  In your BIOS, you'd need to disable the onboard graphics in order to use the add-on card.<br>  <br>  The safest way to upgrade your graphics is to take the machine to a small independent computer shop.  Again you might pay but the risk of having a part turn out to be incompatible and the difficulty of getting switched over from onboard to add-on falls on them.<br>  <br>  Then again if you're feeling a bit ambitious, would like to learn some more about your machine, and especially if you see some success stories online from those who have the same machine as you, you might consider a self-upgrade.|`|1cdsJ3lpaa	In the price range your best bets would either be the HD 4850 or the 9800GTX+.|`|g2epuW92aa	First we would need to know what motherboard you have and what types of slots you have available -> AGP?

RjwyRrxtaa	Clean windows registry means faster PC performance. The registry is one of the most valuable sections of your PC. This is where important information and directories relating to installed software, hardware, temporary files downloaded from the Internet, created documents and folders, and other minor and minor applications are stored.<br>  <br>  Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system. This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the windows registry however is quite risky so these reminders might be a great help before you begin.<br>  <br>  1. Before you clean the registry, be sure you really now how and what you are doing. If you are in doubt and just plain curious, you better consult a professional IT. This is for you and your computer's security.<br>  <br>  2. It is very important to create a back up of all you files before cleaning the windows registry so if the worse thing happens, your files are safe.<br>  <br>  3.

A good registry cleaning software is one that includes multiple features - defragmenter, PC scan, junk file remover, uninstaller, and RAM optimizer.<br>  <br>  Now that you know what it takes to clean windows registry doesn't mean you can do this all by yourself, unless you are an IT professional.<br>  <br>  For more information on free Windows registry repair visit the site.<br>  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|hCT3ou5daa	make sure you have security updated.<br>  Anti Virus (try Avast for free)<br>  Malware protection (try Malwarebytes Anti Malware and Spybot search and destroy)<br>  Firewall u have between zone alarm and comodo firewall<br>  also upgrade on RAM increase performance|`|FoUOqSh5aa	addition to what everyone else is saying...<br>  <br>  delete all the files that u dont need...<br>  and pix... ya know?|`|myhTgsdMaa	download ccleaner from ccleaner.com and run the cleaner, registry cleaner, and then go to tools and then startup and uncheck all that you don't need running all the time (most things can be unchecked except virus protection that you need to run all the time).

2SSA9e9Naa	They have done a lot to streamline their inventory and order process. A lot of cost comes from having a lot of in stock inventory of parts (disk drives, motherboards, etc.) waiting for an order to come in.<br>  <br>  Dell was one of the leaders to streamline all of that. When you order a system from them and the order is confirmed then the request for the parts goes to their suppliers who then ship. Given the volume of systems Dell sells the suppliers can ship a box of parts on demand and not lose money.<br>  <br>  Turn around time is really quick. Dell doesn't have to pay anyone for the parts until they are needed. Shortly after they pay for the parts the system is shipped and the customer is billed which means Dell is reimbursed quick.<br>  <br>  Does that help?|`|YvtFiWT5aa	That's a poorly phrased question.

For example, in C5 put the following.<br>  <br>  =vlookup(b5, A$2:A$404, 1, false)<br>  <br>  what this would do is if it finds a matching value it will return that value into C5, if it doesn't it'll return an error (I think #value).<br>  <br>  The false means do an exact match. The 1 is return the value from the 1st column of the range. Typically you use VLOOKUP for a range encompassing 2 or more columns.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|2Dlo82f5aa	Have u tried VLOOKUP?

4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	I happen to know quite a bit about text matching - <a href="http://brisray.com/qbasic/qmatch.htm" rel="nofollow">http://brisray.com/qbasic/qmatch.htm</a> - but I don't see how you can do this without looking each string up in a dictionary program and extracting the matches.<br>  <br>  The problem you've got are that the words are not all the same length and there is no pattern in the strings or words you ae using.<br>  <br>  There are loads of text dictionary files around - <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=text+dictionary+file" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=text+dict...</a> - but depending on your file of text strings it could take a while to process.<br>  <br>  Here's a couple of ways I can think of to match one against the other. For all of them it's quicker if the dictionary file is sorted alphabetically - which most are.<br>  <br>  How complex the progam is going to get depends on your input strings. Are the words simply contanenated or are there words inside of words (wantedwords gives want, ant, ante, ted, wanted, words etc)<br>  <br>  1) Split the string one letter at a time and check against the dictionay file.<br>  <br>  For example, using the fist one "mp3one"<br>  <br>  1st and 2nd characters - "mp" - look up in dictionary<br>  1st, 2nd 3rd characters - mp3 - look up in dictionary<br>  <br>  first word found, so start again<br>  <br>  4th and 5th characters - "on" - do you need this?<br>  4th, 5th, and 6th charactes - one<br>  <br>  2) Go through each of the dictionary words and look through each of the strings using the equivilent of the instring keyword. This looks for one string inside of another and usually give a true / false result or returns the position of the word inside the string, -1, 0 or NUL depending on the language you are using, if not found.<br>  <br>  Both methods may take a time to complete, may not find all the words you want (like mp3 - is that a dictionary word?) and may give false positives (on, one etc.)|`|75nbESJUaa	RegEx will help a little bit, but really, what u ask is more in the direction of cryptography.

The overall throughput from your router to your ISP will remain same, but that may not be the case when the router splits your home network. <br>  Say for example your connection is a 6mbps line and  you have 2 computer connected, ideally router will try to halve the connection speed to the pc's but if one pc is idle and the other is doing a lot of activites then the bandwidth will not be shared equally.<br>  If you want a dedicated bandwidth at ur home then i would suggest that you go get on cisco 2800 or 3600 series router. That will make sure that other PC doesnot interfere with your bandwidth|`|AA11224458	yes it will have an impact. the more people on the network doing stuff the more bandwidth being consumed.|`|f2cfbae64be87e08060a8936a13ab4e5aa	yup dats true!!

It also has a smaller footprint than most other A/V software and has run successfully on all of the Winboxes I've installed to date.<br>  <br>  However, I always encourage people to try the software for themselves and make their best judgement based on their experience. Most if not all A/V software includes a free version or a trial version, so download it and give it a try. Good luck!|`|AA11109433	Avast is the best, free and always up do date, catches everything.|`|b7a12f9cf3fcc9d8e0dabfffca548164aa	AVG is the best because... it free and it streng is beyong compare!|`|e3007c5eb016b4cf853c372f1c2dc53caa	Of the three you named I have used two of these softwares.

However if your server is Shaw Cable ( in Canada) they have an even better solution " Shaw Secure" which includes pop blocker, Spam blocker, Spyware Blocker and a Firewall. They also update Virus definitions more frequently than any other Anti-virus program I know of and .. if you are a Shaw subscriber, it is free|`|5b06fa44002e4e28fe63d320931df7bcaa	I use AVG, have had no problems, very good.|`|AA10592685	I keep hearing avg is good and am thinking of switching, the one I use is good  (avast) but slows my computer tremendously!

You're not specifying the model of phillips cam, so can't point you to a specific driver, however, if you do a search for that model, you'll probably have some results. Alternatively, there are generic drivers that will work just fine. For example, on a SmileCam, the driver that comes with it is not that great. However, the default driver that comes with XP (dual mode usb camera plus) gave perfect clarity video.<br>  <br>  Another thing that will affect some camera video quality is low-light conditions. If you get the same poor quality on normal (bright daylight) conditions, then that's not the issue. <br>  <br>  Finally, depending what kind of resolution you're trying to view your video at might not be optimal for the camera you're using. Look at the specs for the camera and see what kind of resolution it works best under.|`|5d2ca279139390066a1caa9d1baefe2baa	buy  a good Graphics card for $300 and a webcam for $200 then it will be fine|`|2a9454023b64bc9479cf0844fe595877aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  you could try StickerCam <a href="http://www.stickercam.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stickercam.com</a>  hit the broadcast tab.. select your webcam..  in the application (E.g.

6451b948ab6c1a99b46f4b78ee562c23aa	With the Windows operating system, there are many possible issues. Dirty or bad ethernet connector is a top possibility, as even a short drop in connection will trigger the "off-line" mode selection.<br>  <br>  I ALWAYS troubleshoot by booting one of those Live CD Linux disks. Get and burn yours at <a href="http://pclinuxos.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pclinuxos.com/</a> and boot from it. What happens is Linux starts, configures itself, and waits for you to start the browser. When you do (try Firefox from the BigDaddy ISO), see if Firefox also goes off line. That confirms a bad connector, as you have ruled out EVERYTHING else, such as virus and driver problems.<br>  <br>  By the way, Linux will even report hardware problems, such as a defective ethernet card, during the boot process.<br>  <br>  This isn't what you describe, but for completeness, here it is. If you use a dialup modem, be sure you have call waiting turned off.  Do this by dialing *73, - or whatever it is where you are - before the call to your ISP. You prevent the beeping of an incoming call from bumping you off line, yet call waiting will turn back on when you finish.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|667b467d62cc5df2ffb7175916ddc5b6aa	your computer will automatically go to offline mode when your internet connection is lost.<br>  <br>  you should verify the instructions on how to connect to your internet provider.  it seems your pc is not configured correctly.|`|68b05052c5d2532b5d69227f971ad2d8aa	Isolate the problem, if you want a good diagnosis. What I mean is, is the problem your connection, your software, or your hardware. The software part is easy. Try different web-related programs like Skype and Yahoo Messenger, not just your browser (Internet Explorer of Firefox). If you get the internet connection icon in the taskbar, with two computers, and it disappears shortly afterward, you have an extremely unstable connection. If it does that, or doesn't start at all, use control panel to run a diagnostic on your connection hardware (modem or other device), and if it checks out, call your ISP. The problem is not with you.

bb320241a47006a3fbbf862d4d8b56f1aa	OK.  Lonnnnnnnnnnnng post.  Many Steps.  Worth 50 points at least :)<br>  <br>  First off, windows 2000 pro cannot run active directory.  I am sure you meant windows 2000 server or advanced server.<br>  <br>  1. Load your server with windows 2000 server and apply all of the security updates and service packs.<br>  1a. Right click on my computer and select properties.  Click on network identification.  Click on properties.  Change the server name to something meaningful and reboot.  Its up to you but i hate seeing a server named "Server", "Server01", "Computer" or "be63hdnwwy2752"  try ping that last one and you will see what i mean.<br>  <br>  2.  Install DNS.  Click start, control panel, add/remove programs.  The click on the add/remove windows components button.  Select networking services, then click details.  Click Domain Name Services.  Click apply and OK, feed the server the CD if needed.  Ok your way out of the add/remove programs windows and close the control panel.  Fire up the DNS console, click start, control panel, administrative tools, DNS.  In the left hand pane, right click and select new zone.  Select reverse lookup zone, click next, type in 192.168.1 in the fields provided, and basically accept the defaults until done.<br>  <br>  ***NOTE, Windows 2000 will actually prompt you to install dns during the active directory installation wizard if it doesn't detect it.  You can do it there, but i just add this step above out of habit.***<br>  <br>  3.  Point the server's DNS at itself.  Right click on My network places and select properties.  Double click on your network connection and then click the properties button.  On the subsequent window scroll down in the white box and highlight TCP/IP Protocol.  Click on properties.  **VERY IMPORTANT**  Assign your server a static IP address.  The ip address you assign will depend on what your current subnet it.  For example i will say you are using a subnet of 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.  Your router IP address is 192.168.1.1.<br>  <br>  Click on use static IP address.  type in 192.168.1.254 for the ip address and 255.255.255.0 for the subnet mask.  Type in 192.168.1.1 for the gateway ip address.  Click use the following dns server addresse(s).  Type in 192.168.1.254 **DO NOT TYPE IN YOUR ISP DNS SERVERS HERE** and then click apply and then OK your way out of the menus.  Click on start, run, type cmd in the run box and hit enter.  In the dos window type:  ipconfig /all and hit enter.  The results should show your ip address, subnet mask, gateway and dns servers.  They should reflect what you punched in earlier.<br>  <br>  4.  Install Active directory.  Click start, run, type dcpromo in the run box and hit enter.  The AD installation wizard will start up. Tell it you are createing a new domain controller for a new domain and click next.  Really the only important screen is the domain naming screen. Click next until you reach the screen where it asks you for what you want the dns domain name to be.  If you work for spacey sprockets I would name the domain spaceysprockets.local.  Not .com, not .net, not .org, .local.  Keep clicking next and the system will install AD and prompt you to reboot.<br>  <br>  ***NOTE, click start, run type cmd in the box and <br>  <br>  5.  Log into the server and check that DNS registrations are OK.  Click on start, control panel, administrative tools, DNS.  You should 2 sets of zones in the left hand pane, forward lookup and reverse lookup.  Expand the tree beside forward lookup, you should see alot of things in there.  Expand the tree beside spaceysprockets.local,  You should see _msdcs, _sites, _tcp, etc.  Right click on spaceysprockets.local and select proerties.  On the resulting screen where it says Type: Standard Primary, click change and select Active Directory Integrated.  Ok and all that.  On the part where it says allow dynamic updates select only secure updates.  ***Repeat these steps for the reverse lookup zone 192.168.1.x subnet***  You should not see any folders under 192.168.1.x subnet so don't freak out.  Right click on the server name and select properties.  Click on the forwwarders tab and click on enables forwarders.  ***Punch in you ISP dns servers here***  click apply and ok.  Check that your internet works.<br>  <br>  ***OK, before we go any further, if you are using DHCP to dish out your IP addresses, you need to make double sure your DHCP server is giving out YOUR WINDOWS 2000 SERVER'S IP address as the DNS server.  You ISP servers will not work here!  I can not tell you how many times i have cleaned up a crap AD setup where some damn bench tech has set up the ISP dns servers in dhcp.  Your workstations WILL take 15 minutes plus to log in if you set it up wrong****<br>  <br>  6.  On the server click start, settings, control panel, administrative tools, Active directory users and computers.  In the lect hand pane, click on the "Users" Folder.  In the right hand pane scroll to the bottom and right click, select new -- user.  The new user dialog will open.  Punch in their name and username, then click next.  type in their password keep clicking next until done.  Repeat for each user.<br>  <br>  7.  On each workstation click start, run, type cmd and hit enter.  type ipconfig /all.  After you are convinced that your dhcp server is giving out the correct info you can skip this step on the remainder of the computers.<br>  <br>  8.  Right click on my computer, select properties.  Select the network Identification Tab.  In the domain block type spaceysprockets.local and hit enter.  It will prompt you for a username and password.  This is the domain admin username and password.  The default is administrator and the password was defined in the AD setup.  Punch in the info and click ok.  It will sit there for a bit and the say welcome to the spaceysprockets  domain.  It will prompt you to reboot.  Reboot.  Repeat on each workstation.<br>  <br>  9.  Click control alt delete, click more options, and make sure you select the spaceysprockets domain from the list.  Log in as the domain administrator.  Right click on my computer and select manage.  In the left hand pane, exchane local users and groups, and groups.  In the rught hand pane, double click on administrators and click add.  Type Domain users in the box and click apply or ok.  Repeat on each workstation.<br>  <br>  10.  Log on as each user.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11634194	You can do this only on the server.<br>  <br>  Configure Active Directory<br>  Add the usernames on the AD<br>  <br>  Configure the client to connect to the domain created by the Win2000 advanced server<br>  <br>  Any user in the active directory will be able to login to any of the clients with their username and passwords

AA10146251	My suggestion to you is to get rid of your :"online protection", because I would need alot more indepth info., to help you to resolve the problem.  <br>  <br>  Here is a list of program that I use in both of my computers.<br>  <br>  In my spare time I test antivirus/spyware programs to see if they perform as claimed.  Also to see if they have hidden embedded trojans,adware or malware.  <br>  <br>  Avast free for home use is I use an  excellent state of the art technology that is far superior then any other free or purchase program.   <a href="http://www.avast.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com</a>  (They are out of Prague).   <br>  <br>  They will ask you for your email address so they can send you a free key that is good for one year.  After one year you must request another free key.   Their corporte avast is the same, they just make corporate pay. <br>  <br>  I  have used this program for nine plus years an I never had one virus in my system.  It has an excellent realtime scanner in the background that is light years ahead of any one else with a background scanner.  If you open a webpage and there is a hidden virus of any kind the background scanner will come on and destroy the virus.  (Plus if you keep your speakers on you wil hear a male voice saying, "virus has just been destroyed".   Likewise for the daily updates that come in on an automatic basis twice or three times per day.  Scans all 180,000 objects in my system.  And when it removes a virus from a registry key you can be assured that it is no longer in your system.  <br>  <br>  If you want to spend money I use what the Government of China uses for antivirus program.  <a href="http://www.filseclab" rel="nofollow">http://www.filseclab</a>  (They are out of Beijing, China).  Both program are equal in my opinion on state of the art technology  This program is "Twister", you pay a one time fee for life. Includes all automatic updates, excellent support an all new versions.  (You will be hard pressed to find any one else who will give you this for a one time fee $29.99).  Avast I use in my backup pc.  <br>  <br>  Please note that you can only use one antivirus program, or you will have serious conflict with your system.  You can use three or four antispyware programs without conflict.  <br>  <br>  All of these programs that I am giving you are very low on resources.  They are nothing like Nortons or Mcafee junk an one big resource hogs.  <br>  <br>  For spyware,adware,malware and rogue dialers, (I use ADSL, but like the added protection for rogue dialers).,  Download from <a href="http://www.emsisoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.emsisoft.com</a>   This is an excellent company out of Austria.  They also will ask you for your email so they can send you the key for the free version.  I prefer the paid version, because it comes with an excellent backgroud scanner like "avast", and never will miss anyting.   The free A2Squared v2 for personal home use, does not come with the background scanner.   <br>  <br>  Another good free one I use is from Sweden.  <a href="http://www.lavasoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavasoft.com</a>   Download their free home personal versions Ad-Adware Se Personal.  This company has been around long before any one ever thought of antispyware.   <br>  <br>  Last of all there is a good program out of Prague that I also use, "Ewido Spyware". This is a purchased only version that becomes free after thirty days if you decide not to purchase they will remove the background guard and the automatic updates. You will have to update on a manual basis.  Also scans 175,000 objects in my system. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cyberhawk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberhawk.com</a>  is an excellent free program for “zero day attacks”. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sophos.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sophos.com</a>  You can download their free rootkit protection. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zonealarm.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.zonealarm.com</a>  Excellent free firewall with updates and all new version are free. Download thier free home for personal use.  <br>  <br>  USE THE ONES THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE MOST SECURITY FOR YOUR PC.  ONLY USE ONE FIREWALL AN ONLY ONE ANTIVIRUS OR ELSE YOU WILL HAVE SERIOUS CONFLICT WITH YOUR SYSTEM.  USE AS MANY ANTISPYWARE THAT YOU WANT AND NO CONFLICT.<br>  <br>  Clinical Psychiatrist, France<br>  <br>  Excuse my english.|`|AA10592685	I'm not sure I understand the question, could you be a bit more specific!

AA10146251	In my spare time I test antivirus an antispyware program, to see if they perform as claimed. An also to see if there are embedded trojans, in thier program or the wizard installer they use to guide you through the program.<br>  <br>  I use this antivirus program for over nine years an I have never had one virus in my system.   This program will remove your trojan for you.  Please know that you can only use one antivirus program or you will have serious conflict with your system.  You can use two or three antispyware without conflict.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com</a> Download their free home for personal use.

You will get twice or three times per day automatic updates.  This program has the very best realtime guard running in the background.  If you had this program, installed, the trojan would have never been able to enter your system As the realtime guard in Avast will catch it in realtime and destroy the trojan..  Plus it will advise you with a pop-up in the tray.

If you see a boot menu with all three OSs on it, you can remove 2k and XP, but if you did the installed right on top of the previous, I'm afraid the registry is too heavily modified to be used by 98, not to mention all of the system files changed.

If you can afford a separate graphics processing machine, buy one. If you can't afford it, it will be slow but it will be possible (unless you are doing really hard stuff).

667b467d62cc5df2ffb7175916ddc5b6aa	FAT16<br>  The FAT16 file system was introduced way back with MS–DOS in 1981, and it's showing its age. It was designed originally to handle files on a floppy drive, and has had minor modifications over the years so it can handle hard disks, and even file names longer than the original limitation of 8.3 characters, but it's still the lowest common denominator. The biggest advantage of FAT16 is that it is compatible across a wide variety of operating systems, including Windows 95/98/Me, OS/2, Linux, and some versions of UNIX. The biggest problem of FAT16 is that it has a fixed maximum number of clusters per partition, so as hard disks get bigger and bigger, the size of each cluster has to get larger. In a 2–GB partition, each cluster is 32 kilobytes, meaning that even the smallest file on the partition will take up 32 KB of space. FAT16 also doesn't support compression, encryption, or advanced security using access control lists.<br>  <br>  <br>  FAT32<br>  The FAT32 file system, originally introduced in Windows 95 Service Pack 2, is really just an extension of the original FAT16 file system that provides for a much larger number of clusters per partition. As such, it greatly improves the overall disk utilization when compared to a FAT16 file system. However, FAT32 shares all of the other limitations of FAT16, and adds an important additional limitation—many operating systems that can recognize FAT16 will not work with FAT32—most notably Windows NT, but also Linux and UNIX as well. Now this isn't a problem if you're running FAT32 on a Windows XP computer and sharing your drive out to other computers on your network—they don't need to know (and generally don't really care) what your underlying file system is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Advantages of NTFS<br>  The NTFS file system, introduced with first version of Windows NT, is a completely different file system from FAT. It provides for greatly increased security, file–by–file compression, quotas, and even encryption. It is the default file system for new installations of Windows XP, and if you're doing an upgrade from a previous version of Windows, you'll be asked if you want to convert your existing file systems to NTFS. Don't worry. If you've already upgraded to Windows XP and didn't do the conversion then, it's not a problem. You can convert FAT16 or FAT32 volumes to NTFS at any point. Just remember that you can't easily go back to FAT or FAT32 (without reformatting the drive or partition), not that I think you'll want to.<br>  <br>  The NTFS file system is generally not compatible with other operating systems installed on the same computer, nor is it available when you've booted a computer from a floppy disk. For this reason, many system administrators, myself included, used to recommend that users format at least a small partition at the beginning of their main hard disk as FAT. This partition provided a place to store emergency recovery tools or special drivers needed for reinstallation, and was a mechanism for digging yourself out of the hole you'd just dug into. But with the enhanced recovery abilities built into Windows XP (more on that in a future column), I don't think it's necessary or desirable to create that initial FAT partition.|`|AA11398567	File Allocation Table (FAT) is a partially patented file system developed by Microsoft for MS-DOS and is the primary file system for consumer versions of Microsoft Windows up to and including Windows Me.<br>  <br>  NTFS or New Technology File System is the standard file system of Windows NT and its descendants: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista.|`|AA10546893	all compression methods

The onboard Radeon is always in use by the computer and the built in display. You really can't say you never use it, you use it every time you turn on your computer. It uses a shared memory technology and the less RAM you make available to it in the BIOS the lower the resolution and color depth you will have available to you when you restart, hence the big icons and lack of colors. You need to give it between 16MB and 32MB minimum to be able to run modern office and productivity applications. This type of Video memory sharing is a slower technology than having dedicated high speed video memory that is separate. Computers designed this way generally aren't that great for high end graphics processing such as gaming, video editing, animation creation and rendering, High Speed Simulations, etc. The only way to not have this problem is to get a notebook comptuer that has dedicated video memory for the onboard graphics card/chipset. These notebooks are usually more expensive and marketed towards high end users or gamers. Check the specifications before you buy.

The list I am giving below starts from the easiest to do/apply to the hardest and these consists of:<br>  <br>  Low Disk Space: Windows XP performs well if you have plenty of hard disk space. If you have less that 10 MB better free up space by backing-up and deleting old files and unwanted programs. Defrag your H/D<br>  <br>  Paging File: OS also works faster if you have a paging file set-up<br>  <br>  Programs Loaded In Memory(RAM): Some programs are loaded into memory when you start-up your computer. These are the ones seen on the right of your task bar. Limit these to just the ones that you really need.<br>  <br>  Viruses/Malware/Adware etc: these things might be doing/processing something in the background which is eating up your resources(memory, cpu etc). Run an updated anti-virus/spyware software if you have? If you don't have try this free on-line scanner -> <a href="http://housecall.trendmicro.com/" rel="nofollow">http://housecall.trendmicro.com/</a><br>  <br>  Anti-virus programs: these may also cause your computer to process files slowly because it always check files before running it. It even checks all files on a scheduled basis. Check these setting and see if you can adjust it but not to weak because it might allow viruses to enter your system. Be careful here.<br>  <br>  Corrupt programs: if your have been using your computer for quite sometime now, you may want to consider reformatting it and installing a fresh OS and programs. This normally is the best   way to solve your problem because it really takes care of the above items (H/D has a lot of free space, no viruses because its newly formatted, etc.). But this should be your last resort because this is the hardest to do.<br>  <br>  If all the above has been done and it still is slow. You may now consider upgrading your computer. Processor, memory and HD are the only upgradable peripherals that have significant effect on computer speed. Check the cost of the upgrade, maybe it will be better if you get a totally new one to solve your problem.<br>  <br>  NOTE:I am assuming that you are using Windows XP, If you are using a different OS, the above recommendation may or may not work.

Load the latest drivers first before installing the second card, they allow different manufacturers and different BIOS version to be SLi'd together.<br>  if possible though, even if only for aesthetics, i'd try to get two of the same cards; different cards wouldn't look as pretty in a nice case lol.

I buy all of my stuff from them, and everything is Vista ready.<br>  <br>  Microsoft is about to release its latest operating system, Vista, in January.  It’s going to make all of these “bargain” computers nothing but JUNK as soon as it’s released.  The reason that you are seeing so many cheap systems on the market right now is because a lot of them CAN’T RUN Vista and the merchants are trying to dump them as hard and fast as they can before Vista shows up and everyone learns what a piece of crap they were sold for $500 (or whatever).<br>  <br>  Anyway, I bought a complete, new system from stupidcheapcomputers.net with a warranty for LESS than it would cost me to build it myself or order a custom one from the manufacturer.  You can use my frequent buyer code: ATX926.  That will get an additional 10% discount at checkout.<br>  <br>  I have NEVER had any problems with anything that they have sold me and their customer service is outstanding.

You can reach them at: support@cobrahosts.com<br>  <br>   A domain is a name that you register to be used as your websites online "address" so users are able to find your website. These names make it a lot easier for people to find websites. Before domain names we had to type in IP addresses to go to websites such as: 62.132.185.48 for example.<br>  <br>   A good place to register domain names is: <a href="http://www.godaddy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.godaddy.com</a> they are very dependable.|`|0d1ab34e7d8e6be1528a2d3ee4038e39aa	You need to make sure that when you have a website, people will be able to find your website.  This means doing careful research about what words (related to your site) are most often entered by people at search engines.  If a word is extremely competitive, (meaning that there are lots of websites already supplying sites for those words), you will have a difficult time competing as  a brand new site. <br>  <br>   Try to choose words that relate to your site that are not already in great supply.  Some companies that will host your site will also help with this research.  It's very easy to build a website (even for people who do not know html), but it is not so easy to create a site that attracts the visitors you need to make your site a successful business.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

This can't be accomplished on paper without stapling a copy of every other document to the primary one, and even then is less effective to flip through pages rather than clicking the reference.<br>  <br>  2. Office applications exist to enhance productivity - a spreadsheet done on paper requires manual calculations and formatting, while the computer does all that for you. Composing a letter on paper requires a dictionary, white-out or an eraser, etc. These things are faster and easier to do in a word processor. So more time is spent on the content of the spreadsheet or the letter and less on tedious, repetitive and ultimately unnecessary tasks. Productivity is enhanced.<br>  <br>  3. Do your own damn homework. These questions are simple and thinking about them for more than 3 seconds will yield an answer.

If you want to get better search results out of Lime wire, you have to share files.

You can plug your computer into a hub, router or switch that's connected to another computer or connect them directly using a USB cable or a Ethernet cable. If you running Windows XP it should be very straightforward. If you have wireless connectivity you don't even need a cord you can connect to another PC on the network. <br>  <br>  If you want to share files on your computer with another computer on the network you will need to share the folders. Right click on the folder or drive to be shared. Click on Sharing and Security. Check the box to share the folder and enter a name. You will then be able to see the shared folder on the other computer (you may need to reboot the other computer). You can then copy the files in question to the new computer. This would solve your backup issue as well. It may take quite some time depending on the speed of the connection you have.

Pues es lo más inofensivo del mundo. No se trata de un virus sino de un archivo que se genera automáticamente cuando en cualquier carpeta pasamos a la vista en miniatura (y si tenemos activada la opción mostrar archivos y carpetas ocultos).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Este archivo almacena los datos de esas miniaturas de las imágenes para que la próxima vez que abramos la carpeta de ese modo, las imágenes carguen más rápido. En consecuencia cuantas más imágenes tengamos en una carpeta, más grande será este archivo.<br>  <br>  ?Te molesta? Puedes borrarlo sin problemas aunque lo más probable es que el revoltoso vuelva a aparecer en un futuro. La única forma de borrar permanentemente los archivos thumbs.db es sencillamente no creándolos.<br>  <br>  Para ello abre Mi PC y en el menú superior acude a Herramientas/Opciones de carpeta/Ver y en configuración avanzada selecciona No alojar en caché las vistas en miniatura. Aunque sea un poco, algo de espacio ahorrarás.

AA11935119	To be sure, use more that one anti-spyware solution.

It is advisable to have at least three AS programs that provide active protection. If you have the free version of SuperAntispyware it is an "on demand" scanner only. I use Windows Defender(free), Spybot Search & Destroy (Tea Timer activated)(free), SpywareBlaster(free) and AVG Antispyware(free for 30 days with full active and then a free on demand scanner after that) programs to provide active protections. I also have three programs that are "on demand" scanners. <br>  <br>  Along with the 3 antispyware programs you need to have a Firewall (XP SP2 is good), 1 antivirus program.|`|2df3a63a76a9826d01f9a95d422c9b9aaa	Yes. It should be. This will be known from  smooth running of your PC.  I an also suggest that you safeguard your PC against spams. Many hours are wasted due to spam email. However, by taking simple precautions while giving out your email and installing updated free software, you can prevent spam.

No. Until you stop using Internet Explorer, Outlook and other microsoft products, you aren't ever free from Malware Threats.<br>  <br>  Also, not every anti-spyware program out there can get anything. The problem is, they can only look for what they know exists. My suggestion is to use Adaware from Lavasoft, its free, and will get rid of 99.9% of all malware out there.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavasoftusa.com/</a><br>  <br>  Its free for personal use. (Products->SE edition)<br>  <br>  So here are my suggestions to make your life ALOT easier.<br>  Firstly, stop using Internet explorer. No matter how much people say its getting better, its not.<br>  Firefox is safer, and better looking too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.firefox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.firefox.com</a><br>  <br>  Firefox is a Free web browser that already had all those new innovations the newest IE has. Stop using IE, and a good chunk of malware problems will go away.<br>  <br>  The second major threat is from Outlook. (express or otherwise). Switch to another email client. Thunderbird is good.<br>  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird...</a><br>  Thunderbird is also free to use. Has an awsome anti-spam feature, my only complaint is you cant use multiple identities with it, but you learn to work around it, if you ever used them ;)<br>  Eudora is decent as well, but not free..<br>  <a href="http://www.eudora.com/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eudora.com/download/</a><br>  Its good, good anti-spyware, quick and simple.<br>  <br>  Dont forget to scan your computer at least once a week with Adaware to keep it healthy. Think of Running adaware like getting the oil changed on your car. Every 3000 miles, or 500 downloads. Well, just once a week will do it =)

If you see new toolbars in your Internet Explorer that you haven't intentionally installed, if your browser crashes inexplicably, or if your home page has been "hijacked" (or changed without your knowledge), your computer is most probably infected with spyware.

I believe you want Theme to change the way your desktop looks. It will be within this part, likely as a separate section within it. You may have to play around with it all a bit, but you can always undo anything that might not be what you want. If you are running WinXP you can access this in the Control Panel, too, under Appearance. Hope this helps. Good luck.

f96955840ec1263ed450c028d4f63938aa	I agree with Japhee, but if you are talking about landline phone, you may need another equipment which is used for phone recording. The equipment will cost you under 10 bucks. You need to connect that equipment to your phone line directly and there is an audio out cable. You may plug that cable into your CPU's mic or line-in socket. <br>  <br>  Once you are able to put audio into mic or line-in socket, either through your cell or landline phone, you can use any software which allows recording. I suggest you can go with Jetaudio, it is fee and you can record in wav or mp3 format according to your requirement. <br>  <br>  Dont forget to select line-in or mic as a recording source. You can also use sound recorder utility which comes in accessory of Windows.|`|a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	YES.

Then users use Workstations, which connect to network ethernet switches, then the network Servers are conected to their switch to service the workstations,  then they all connect from the switch to the router to get internet access, or to break up network's into segments. First the ISP/TELCO will install your WAN link which is called your<br>   Point Of Presence (POP), then it goes to your Gateway router, then your firewall, then other network routers, then your switch.  Your firewall should be in between your  Gateway router because it is filtering every TCP packet incoming to the network, then your first main switch, then extra routers to break up your network are just RouterA, RouterB, , SwitchA SwitchB etc. Then Servers usally have their own Switches, which should have Gigybite switch ports, then they are connected to workgroup switches which will most likely be 10/100 switch ports with maby one or two 1GB port to uplink to the main switches in the wiring closet.  All devices will use the TCP/IP internet protocol sweet.

All incoming communication from Internet to any LANs PC is sent to same public IP of Gateway and than redistributed by it to endpoint PCs (with help of other LAN devices - if LAN is of bigger size). All outgoing communication from LAN’s PCs to Internet is sent via LAN communication to Gateway, which then sends it to public IP of destination using Internet.

What’s perhaps is also worth of mentioning is - NEVER trust massages added by some mail provides (including Yahoo) which claims: ” Scanned – virus free”, “scanned by Norton AntyVirus” etc. There is nothing easier than add fake identically looking massage to a footer of letter which contains Trojan. Picture of fake infected letter which I personally received lately (note that address appears to be of Yahoo Customer Service and fake massage at the bottom claims it has been scanned and is virus free).

So when you enter a room, you need to ignore the entire room. As you get to know people you can take them off of your ignore list. Yahoo tunnel is a good client to use. Very unlikely you will be booted with YAHOO TUNNEL. Google it...There is a small fee for that. I have it!<br>  PS. It's funny how people take an answer like mine, realize that it is the best, and repeat it over again! They like to add nonsense to it, to seem like they are further helping you...lol See answer  below mine! Use your brain people. Try to be original! "maybe if I repeat what he said, and ad some blither, they will give me the 10 points instead!!"<br>  pss.

After Yahoo liquidated Java and CHAT-2 protocols any robust method which would offer you any substantial protection SIMPLY DOESN’T EXIST. You could try using YTunnel:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ytunnelpro.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ytunnelpro.com/</a> <br>  <br>  or try ignoring few names of bots which attackers use to boot you (using chat client could help intercept bot’s names):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.customcodes.com/deep/yahelite/" rel="nofollow">http://www.customcodes.com/deep/yahelite...</a> <br>  <br>  Some lighter booters are very sensitive and require all bots to work. When few are ignored (server side – as with Messenger ignore) booting becomes ineffective. Still if your oppressors would try harder booter they will be able to boot you no matter what you use. <br>  <br>  Only good method – make more names and use ones which your attackers don’t know it’s you. Using client as YahElite could be helpful considering that YahElite allows to log few names simultaneously at the same time,…<br>  <br>  Referring to answer immediately above: - besides flooding booter use few other methods: for instance sends error packets which confuse servers. Problem with booters is that attacks are server side – another words it is Yahoo which disconnects attacked user and not user’s computer which can’t handle flood. Considering this it really isn’t critically crucial what program are used by victims, but rather vulnerability of protocols play crucial role. Only existing now Yahoo protocol (YMSG) and its subversions referring to subsequently released by Yahoo versions of Messenger (YMSG15, YMSG14 etc) unfortunately were the most sensitive for attacks - from always.<br>  <br>  In regard to “how do I obtain boot program” – I would strongly not recommend this. Booters (despise their author claims to contrary) are at least to say very, very fishy, often comes with Trojans. In most cases you are asked to place some files in Windows System 32 folder (by far top preferred place by Trojans) and their services are almost always located in difficult to prosecute jurisdictions (Netherlands, third world countries) – quite a coincidence doesn’t it? (especially considering that distributing malicious programs “for research purposes” is not illegal and they should have nothing to fear in US, UK and many other countries). From my experience defense by retaliation really doesn’t provide anything at all. You most likely become infected and exploited by some Trojan. <br>  <br>  Better tactic: make new name, open voice conference, invite only friends you know are not booter bullies and let booter kiddies enjoy conversation in room with porn bots alone.

667b467d62cc5df2ffb7175916ddc5b6aa	It is called The Google File System .<br>  <br>  Google File System (GFS) is a proprietary distributed file system based on Linux and developed by Google for their applications' use. It does not appear to be publicly available.<br>  <br>  Design<br>  GFS is optimized for Google's core data storage needs, web searching, which can generate enormous amounts of data that needs to be retained[2]; Google File System grew out of an earlier Google effort, "BigFiles", developed by Larry Page and Sergei Brin in the early days of Google, whilst it was still located in Stanford[2]. The data is stored persistently, in very large, even multiple gigabyte-sized files which are only extremely rarely deleted, overwritten, or shrunk; files are usually appended to or read. It is also designed and optimized to run on Google's computing clusters, the nodes of which are comprised of cheap, "commodity" computers, which means precautions must be taken against the high failure rate of individual nodes and the subsequent data loss. Other design decisions select for high data throughputs, even when that makes latency worse.<br>  <br>  The nodes are divided into two types: Master nodes and Chunkservers. Chunkservers store the data files, with each individual file broken up into fixed size chunks (hence the name) of about 64 megabytes[3], similar to clusters or sectors in regular file systems. Each chunk is assigned a unique 64-bit label, and logical mappings of files to constituent chunks are maintained. Each chunk is replicated a fixed number of times throughout the network, the default being three, but even more for high demand files like executables.<br>  <br>  The Master server doesn't usually store the actual chunks, but rather all the metadata associated with the chunks, such as the tables mapping the 64-bit labels to chunk locations and the files they make up, the locations of the copies of the chunks, what processes are reading or writing to a particular chunk, or taking a "snapshot" of the chunk pursuant to replicating it (usually at the instigation of the Master server, when, due to node failures, the number of copies of a chunk has fallen beneath the set number). All this metadata is kept current by the Master server periodically receiving updates from each chunk server ("Heart-beat messages").<br>  <br>  Permissions for operations are handled by a system of time-limited, expiring "leases", where the Master server grants permission to a process for a finite period of time during which no other process will be granted permission by the Master server to access the chunk. The modified chunkserver, which is always the primary chunk holder, then propagates the changes to the chunkservers with the backup copies. The changes are not saved until all chunkservers acknowledge, thus guaranteeing the completion and atomicity of the operation.<br>  <br>  Programs access the chunks by first querying the Master server for the locations of the desired chunks; if the chunks are not being operated on (if there are no outstanding leases), the Master replies with the locations, and the program then contacts and receives the data from the chunkserver directly (similar to Kazaa and its Supernodes).<br>  <br>  <br>  for more info download pdf version <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/gfs-sosp2003.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://labs.google.com/papers/gfs-sosp20...</a>|`|AA12341420	Well it's hard to say, but chances are it's not just a single technology.

AA11579853	The person on top talks about a feed aggragator or RSS-reader.  Don't bother downloading one -- the newest version of Internet Explorer and Mozillia Firefox (getfirefox.com) act as aggragators.  Just upgrade your webbrowser.<br>  <br>  Once you've done that, here's how to use the RSS-reading feature:<br>  <br>  1) When you go to a site with an RSS feed (for example, my site <a href="http://www.lucastds.com/webcomic/)," rel="nofollow">http://www.lucastds.com/webcomic/),</a> an orange box will appear.  In firefox, it appears up next to the site address and in the new Internet Explorer it appears on the top line.  The box looks like this: <br>  <br>  (a link to a picture of the rss feed icon)<br>  <a href="http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h218/pointingandgiggling/rss-feed-icon.png" rel="nofollow">http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h218/p...</a><br>  <br>  2) When you click on the feed icon it will do one of two things:<br>  IN FIREFOX:<br>  It will ask you to add the feed to your "live bookmarks".  You click "Add to bookmarks" and once you've done that the feed is there for you to find in your bookmarks. folder<br>  <br>  IN INTERNET EXPLORER<br>  You click the feed icon and it will take you to a page showing you what content is in the feed.  You click "Subscribe to this feed"... then, you click "view my feeds" and you'll be able to find your feeds in your favourites centre.<br>  <br>  In general, I find Firefox a bit better for viewing feeds than the new Internet Explorer, but explorer gets the job done.<br>  <br>  Once you get used to it, this process is quite easy.  RSS feeds usually show you a list of the latest articles or news stories (or, in the case of my website, comics), published by a site.  When you click on the feed that you've bookmarked/favourited, it will show you the latest content available from that site.|`|4f2071ce0b3deda8b527470042c9a809aa	Copy the URL at the top first.

116ed7431575eb1d31a4f1cf889dc190aa	FTC Consumer Alert <br>  Federal Trade Commission ■ Bureau of Consumer Protection ■ Office of Consumer and Business Education <br>  Who’s Spamming Who? Could it be You? <br>  Spammers may be using your computer to send unsolicited — and possibly offensive — email <br>  offers for products and services. Spammers are using home computers to send bulk emails by the <br>  millions. Indeed, computer security experts estimate that as much as 30 percent of all spam is relayed <br>  by compromised computers located in home offices and living rooms, but controlled from afar. <br>  According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation’s consumer protection agency, <br>  spammers can compromise your computer in several ways, depending on what kind of Internet connection <br>  you have. All computers connected to the Internet are potential targets, but those with broadband <br>  connections are especially attractive to spammers because they are “always on.” Spammers scan the <br>  Internet, searching for points of entry and then install hidden software that allows remote access to <br>  your data and programs. That, in turn, allows the spammer to send messages from your computer. <br>  Remote access software also can be installed by a virus: A spammer sends email with a virus in the <br>  attachment. If you open the infected attachment, a virus is released that installs the hidden software. <br>  The person who sent the virus now can access the data and programs on your computer, or take over <br>  many computers and use them to send spam. <br>  It can be very difficult to tell if a spammer has installed hidden software on your computer, but <br>  there are some warning signs. For example, you may receive emails accusing you of sending spam; <br>  you may find email messages in your “outbox” that you didn’t send; or your computer is using more <br>  power than it has in the past to run the programs you use. <br>  If your computer has been taken over by a spammer, you could face serious problems. Your <br>  Internet Service Provider (ISP) may prevent you from sending any email at all until the virus is treated, <br>  and treatment could be a complicated, time-consuming process. <br>  To avoid becoming an unwitting culprit, the FTC encourages you to: <br>  ● Use anti-virus software and keep it up to date. You can download anti-virus software from the <br>  Web sites of software companies or buy it in retail stores. Look for anti-virus software that recognizes <br>  current viruses, as well as older ones; that can effectively reverse the damage; and that updates <br>  automatically. <br>  ● Be cautious about opening any attachment or downloading any files from emails you receive. <br>  Don’t open an email attachment — even if it looks like it’s from a friend or coworker — unless you <br>  are expecting it or know what it contains. If you send an email with an attached file, include a text <br>  message explaining what it is. <br>  ● Use a firewall to protect your computer from hacking attacks while it is connected to the Internet. A <br>  firewall is software or hardware designed to block hackers from accessing your computer. A properly <br>  configured firewall makes it tougher for hackers to locate your computer and get into your <br>  programs and files. A firewall is different from anti-virus protection: Anti-virus software scans <br>  incoming communications and files for troublesome files; a firewall helps make you invisible on the <br>  Internet and blocks all communications from unauthorized sources. It’s especially important to run a <br>  firewall if you have a broadband connection. <br>  Some recently released operating system software (including Windows XP) comes with a built-in <br>  firewall. Because it may be shipped in the “off” mode, check your online “Help” feature for specifics <br>  on turning it on and setting it up properly. If your operating system doesn’t include a firewall, <br>  you can install separate firewall software that runs in the background while you use your computer <br>  and surf the Internet. Several free firewall software programs are available on the Internet. (You can <br>  find one by typing “free firewall” into your favorite search engine.) Or you can buy a hardware <br>  firewall — an external device that includes firewall software. Like anti-virus software, a firewall <br>  needs to be updated regularly to stay effective. <br>  ● Check your “sent items” file or “outgoing” mailbox to see if there are messages that you did not <br>  intend to send. Many spammers have learned to hide their unauthorized access, so even if there are <br>  no illegitimate messages in your outbox, you can’t be sure that your computer hasn’t been used to <br>  send spam. <br>  ● If your computer is infected, take action immediately. If your computer has been hacked or <br>  infected by a virus, disconnect from the Internet right away. Then scan your entire computer with <br>  fully updated anti-virus software. Report unauthorized accesses to your ISP. Also, if you suspect that <br>  any of your passwords have been compromised, call that site’s company immediately and change <br>  your password. <br>  ● Learn more about securing your computer at www.ftc.gov/infosecurity. <br>  The FTC works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in <br>  the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a <br>  complaint or to get free information on consumer issues, visit www.ftc.gov or call toll-free, 1-877- <br>  FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357); TTY: 1-866-653-4261. The FTC enters Internet, telemarketing, identity <br>  theft, and other fraud-related complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online database available to <br>  hundreds of civil and criminal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad. <br>  FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION FOR THE CONSUMER <br>  1-877-FTC-HELP www.ftc.gov <br>  January 2004|`|fc77a866e635617e01c610e44fc41f33aa	I'll keep my answer simple.<br>  <br>  There are 2 things you mainly have to be aware of:<br>  <br>  1) Don't let anyone access your computer remotely (physically or virtually);<br>  <br>  2) Don't install untrusted software (knowingly, through email attachments, through web sites, etc.)<br>  <br>  In the first point, you need to make sure you computer is secure, even when you're not using it. I believe that the physical option is easy, unless you're sharing your computer with other people. For the virtual protection, a) activate your Windows Firewall (or another one) and b) try to use your computer behind a firewall/gateway at home.<br>  <br>  For the second point, that's where you have to be careful. Some rules of thumb (some are obvious):<br>  - never run programs from untrusted sources, expecially files that pretend to be zipped as .EXE files;<br>  - never use peer-2-peer apps to get .EXE files. They're full of trojans and viruses;<br>  - install Firefox and use it instead of IE. Avoid installing untrusted ActiveX from web sites as they are programs and can mess up your PC;<br>  - once in a while (every year), reinstall Windows. Keep your personnal data on another partition (D: drive) so that it will be easier to reinstall Windows on your C: drive. You'll see a huge improvement in performance and you'll get rid of any spyware/viruses you can have. Make sure that you don't reinstall over your version of Windows, but that you actually format the C: drive and start from scratch;<br>  - install an anti-virus;<br>  - install an anti-spyware.<br>  <br>  If you follow these simple rules, you'll greatly reduce the risks of your problems happening again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|70503cfcfc1323e870ead31c66f98600aa	this is a good question but can anybody make and answer a litte short|`|a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Computers which generate SPAM or are used to DoS attacks are often referred as “zombies”.

Double-click that, and click on Update Driver. Before that, you can go to pcdrivers.com and search for the right driver for your sound card (you'll have to know the make/model of your sound card).

It is a proxy. In order to surf anonymously you must use a proxy. Proxies prevent literally everything on the web from aquiring your actual IP address, thus you are anonymous.<br>  <br>  I believe Secure Tunnel's website is secure-tunnel.com. They are a trusted Proxy server. You can choose from several different layers of protection all at varying prices. I purchased the Gold Edition for about $79.95 a year. It gave me a downloadable client which is preferred and a reliable dedicated connection that actually made my internet FASTER because it had a precache of the internet on thier web server. Definetly a good thing if you want security.<br>  <br>  Had too many problems with my video games such as BF2 etc and connecting so I scrapped the idea. But remember the opposite of functionality is security. If you want to be secure you have to pay a price and give up some luxury in most cases. If you need security as a priority I highly recommend Secure Tunnel.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Here's a link to a page you might find useful if you don't have the help files or MSDN files:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=211774" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=21177...</a><br>  <br>  Just in case, here's a small list from that page:<br>  <br>     vbBack - A backspace character [Chr(8)]<br>     vbCr - A carriage return [Chr(13)]<br>     vbCrLf - A carriage return and line feed [Chr(13) + Chr(10)]<br>     vbLf - A linefeed [Chr(10)]<br>     vbNewLine - A platform-specific new line character<br>     vbNullChar - A null character of value 0 [Chr(0)]<br>     vbNullString - A string of value 0 [no Chr code]<br>     vbTab - A tab character [Chr(9)]<br>  <br>  Also check online for an ASCII table, so you can use the CHR function (for example, using chr(32) for space, etc -  you can even use these character codes for action keys like escape (chr 27) and so on). Just in case again, here's a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asciitable.com/</a><br>  <br>  Finally, don't forget to concatenate your strings (add characters to strings) using the "&" operator, for example:<br>  <br>  dim mystring = "hello," & chr(32) & "world!"<br>  <br>  making the string "Hello, world" (without quotes)<br>  <br>  Hopefully that helps you.

8057f32da872bc5d70da44ebb18def46aa	Well, there's numerous ways to do it, but the one that first came to my mind would be Content Advisor.  This is a program that is offered to you with any computer that runs Windows.  In order to use this program, go into your Internet Browser and click on the Tools link.  Once you have the Tools menu open, click on Internet Options, and when that window pops up click on the Content tab at the top.  This will bring you directly to a window that allows you to Enable the Content Advisor.  You will have to select a password, which will be your supervisor password (unless you've already used Content Advisor before), and then type enter that in order to View/Enable it.  What the Content Advisor does is allow you to select levels of language, nudity, sex, and violence that users can see on your computer when they view any website.  You can also add Approved or Disapproved websites (click on the Approved Sites tab) by adding them to a list, so this is a way to block that website because you can add Disapproved sites to this list.  I guess it just depends on the type of website you want to block--just put a Content Advisor block on that website and no one (except those who know the supervisor password) can view that website.  The Content Advisor can also be turned off at anytime, but it is something to look into, especially if you have kids.  Hope this helps you!!|`|a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Doing this will prevent your PC from EVER connecting to it again (even if you would go on different site which would attempt to redirect you there or download some features like pics from instance from blocked domain):<br>  <a href="http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.ht...</a> <br>  In host file define to be blocked address as 127.0.0.1|`|7fd19fee5eeba60e9a6a13b837bf7b6aaa	You can go to your firewall, and add the site to the blocked list/|`|db68d9486857d3a57fba6b59110c343aaa	what You Do Is Go To your Internet Browser And Click on tools and Options then to the content tab click allowed sites or blocked sites. type in the site and blocked for good|`|fd0293c512b746a0b9927488cc27f0feaa	in IE, go to Tools, Internet Options, Security, Restricted Sites, click the Sites button, type in the address of the site you want to block and click Add, then OK out.

If Wireless icon doesn’t show at all there you can make one from same place. <br>  <br>  Generally in order to wireless connection to work (as well all above steps to work), it is necessary to have wireless adapter installed on PC. To see if you have it go to: right click “My Computer” >> Properties >> Hardware (tab) >> Device Manager (button) >> click plus sign next to “Network Adapters” to extend tree and see do you have any adapter which have “Wireless” in parts of its name. If you don’t you will need to purchase and install additional hardware (network card or external adapter).

You would need home wireless router which supports WPA encryption (and most new days routers have support for WPA – which is ONLY safe encryption by the way) and PCs equipped with wireless cards or adapters. Taking advantage of the fact that in most routers same WPA connection can be set to use many different keys (which could be used as passwords), you could set connection to use few different ones giving different key to each user (which would allow them connecting to your network). Ability of controlling when each user logged in and off would be also simply available in most router’s logs accessible from it’s interface (access to which you could secure with password) - accessible from every and any PC of your network as well remotely from Internet. Never really thought of using router this way so don’t have any good suitable for your need example off hand, anyway because most routers documentation is accessible both online, as well manufacturer’s phone sell lines would be able to help, you could do some googline checking major names (Motorolla, Linksys, Westell, Belkin, etc) and do some reading or calling.|`|d260e4ff144e45f45acd395db7bf8e45aa	If you have just 1 computer sitting on a desk at home you have a LAN.  A Local Area Network is no more than having 1 standalone computer or having many networked together with the use of switches, hubs, or routers.  To accomplish what you want to do you have 2 choices.  A Workgroup, which is almost always choice for home or small office networks, or a Domain.  In a Workgroup each computer has its own Accounts and Passwords.  And in order for another User and Computer to access those files they would have to know the corret credentials on the computer hosting the files they want access to.  You can see this would become overwhelming from an Administrative point of view with more than 10 or so computers because every person would have to have a user account and password on each machine.  The more manageable solution is a Domain where one computer, a Server, is used to authenticate users and computers and to grant permissions to Users or Computers for access to shared files or resources.

It is slower, if you know how to measure it... The only reason it is supposedly "safer" is because there aren't as many people who try to hack it or make viruses for it... It doesn't have more features, if you keep up with windows update and all of the patches, internet explorer 7 is just as safe and has just as many features.<br>  <br>  I guess it all depends on what you like, download it and check it out, but to me, it is just a waste of space.

If using Linksys router, Internet floods with similar reports and sometimes quite unorthodox solutions to problem (as changing private IP of router for instance). This is also very typical symptom of weak signal. Most network adapters comes with utilities (usually visible in system tray on taskbar) which allows measuring signal strength and noise in real time. Reposting question providing those data, as well attaching information of your network architecture (routers brand and model) could help narrowing cause.

AA11255292	You have an adware program on your computer. If the system restore files are infected then doing a System Restore is useless. <br>  <br>  System Restore was never designed or intended to be a method for Malware removal. It is a way to get your computer functioning properly when you have something becomes corrupted.<br>  <br>  The programs listed in the steps below should remove this adware. Since most adware is installed by Trojans you should use both programs. Do the setup for the AdAware SE for best adware removal. <br>  <br>  This procedure works for all Malware. Use any AntiVirus or AntiSpy program you choose.<br>  <br>  Download and Update Ewido (now called the AVG Antispyware). Do not run:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ewido.net/en/download/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ewido.net/en/download/...</a><br>  <br>  Download AdAware SE and update. Do the setup. Do not run:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_ad-aware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_ad-awa...</a><br>  <br>  AdAware SE Setup:<br>  <br>  1. Select "use custom scanning options" then select "customize". Make sure the following options are enabled: "scan within archives," "scan active processes," "scan registry," "deep scan registry," "scan my IE favorites for banned URLs," "scan my Hosts file."<br>  <br>  2. Select the "tweak" option. Under "scanning engine," make sure "unload recognized processes and modules during scan" is enabled. Enable "scan registry for all users instead of current users."<br>  <br>  3. Under "cleaning engine" turn on "always try to unload modulesa€|," "during removal unload explorer and IE if necessary," "let windows remove files in use at next restart," and "delete quarantined items after restoring."<br>  <br>  4. Use the "select drives and folders to scan" option to ensure that your entire hard drive is scanned (if you have more than one hard drive, scan all of them (of course, do not include floppy and CD/DVD).<br>  <br>  <br>  TEMPORARILY SHOW HIDDEN FILES AND FOLDERS.<br>  <br>  1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. <br>  <br>  2. Click Appearance and Themes, and then click Folder Options.<br>  <br>  3. On the View tab, under Hidden files and folders, click "Show hidden files and folders", and clear(uncheck) the "Hide protected operating system files" check box.<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: Files are hidden by Windows for a very good reason. It is not wise to experiment with these files. Unfortunately, to successfully remove modern spyware we must turn this protection off temporarily. Please turn the protection back on when you have finished cleaning your system.<br>  <br>  <br>  EMPTY INTERNET EXPLORER BROWSER CACHE:<br>  <br>  1. On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options. <br>  <br>  2. On the General tab, in the Temporary Internet Files section, click the Delete Files button. Select the Delete all offline content check box in the confirmation dialogue box that appears, click OK. Click OK again.<br>  <br>  RESTART IN SAFE MODE:<br>  <br>  To do this you need to hold down or repeatedly tap the F8 key while the computer is booting (when the computer is displaying a black screen with white text). When the boot menu appears, use your keyboard arrows to select "Safe Mode."<br>  <br>  Safe Mode can look quite ugly. The color may look bad, and all of your desktop icons will be very large. This is normal.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  START THE SCAN WITH YOUR ANTI-VIRUS OR ANTI-SPYWARE PROGRAM.<br>  <br>  <br>  When the scan and removal are completed REBOOT COMPUTER. This will restart you in normal mode. DON'T FORGET TO RESET HIDDEN FILES AND FOLDERS.<br>  <br>  <br>  NEW RESTORE POINT.<br>  <br>  The RESTORE POINTS may be infected with the Malware and cannot be used.<br>  <br>  HERE'S HOW:<br>  <br>  1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. <br>  <br>  2. Click Performance and Maintenance, click System, and then click on the System Restore tab.<br>  <br>  3. Select the Turn Off System Restore check box, click Apply, then restart your computer.<br>  <br>  4. Return to the System Restore Tab and turn System Restore back on.<br>  <br>  <br>  TO SET A NEW RESTORE POINT:<br>  <br>  1. Click the Start button.<br>  <br>  2. Point to Programs, then navigate to Accessories, then System Tools, then click System Restore.<br>  <br>  3. Choose Create a restore point, and then click Next.<br>  <br>  4. In the Restore point description box, type a name for your restore point, and then click Next.<br>  <br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  NOTE: If you are using Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and are unable to access the Internet after removing Malware, there is a command that may fix the problem. It works by resetting the winsock catalogue. Click on Start, then Run and type CMD in the box. Click OK. Type "netsh winsock reset" (no quotes)into the DOS window that appears.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDITION INFORMATION ABOUT TROJANS:<br>  <br>  There are Trojans that fall into the Smitfraud family.

You need to restore your computer back to a time when internet explorer worked. To do this, click start, then run. In the dialog box enter msconfig. When the configuation window comes up click the button that says launch system restore. Click "Restore my computer to an earlier time". Pick a date that your computer was working fine(i.e. able to print, download attachments, etc...) then click next. Click next again to verify the date, then the restoration process will begin. This process will put your computer back to the state that it was in on the date that you selected. You will not loose any data such as documents, pictures, music, etc. The main thing that it restores are system and program settings(This will also fix the problem with the internet options window not comming up). The date that you chose may be a time when the computer was on Internet Explorer 6, which is OK, since your IE7 was messed up(If it is not, then restore it again to a date that was before the date that you previously selected). To get back to 7 go to Microsoft's web site and download a fresh copy to get a fresh clean installation. As far a firewall inconcerned you really don't need to install one if you have Windows XP, since it is built in to the operating system. To turn it on click start, then click control panel, then click, then click windows firewall. Click the on checkbox to turn it on.

8fca156e3aa3b4ab0d7393821fb374b6aa	Most programs run properly on Windows XP. The exceptions are some older games and other programs that were written specifically for an earlier version of Windows. To run your program on Windows XP, try the following:<br>  <br>  Run the Program Compatibility Wizard. As an alternative, you can set the compatibility properties manually. <br>  Update your program, drivers, or hardware. <br>  These options are covered in detail below.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Program Compatibility Wizard<br>  This wizard prompts you to test your program in different modes (environments) and with various settings. For example, if the program was originally designed to run on Windows 95, set the compatibility mode to Windows 95 and try running your program again. If successful, the program will start in that mode each time. The wizard also allows you to try different settings, such as switching the display to 256 colors and the screen resolution to 640 x 480 pixels.<br>  <br>  If compatibility problems prevent you from installing a program on Windows XP, run the Program Compatibility Wizard on the setup file for the program. The file might be called Setup.exe or something similar, and is probably located on the Installation disc for the program.<br>  <br>  To run the Program Compatibility Wizard<br>  Start the Program Compatibility Wizard. <br>  Follow the instructions in the wizard. <br>   Note<br>  <br>  To start the Program Compatibility Wizard, click Start, click Help and Support, click Find compatible hardware and software for Windows XP, and then, under See Also in the navigation pane, click Program Compatibility Wizard. <br>  Set the compatibility properties manually<br>  As an alternative to running the Program Compatibility Wizard, you can set the compatibility properties for a program manually. The settings are the same as the options in the Program Compatibility Wizard.<br>  <br>  To set the compatibility properties for a program manually<br>  Right-click the program icon on your desktop or the shortcut on the Start menu for the program you want to run, and then click Properties. <br>  Click the Compatibility tab, and change the compatibility settings for your program. <br>   Notes<br>  <br>  The Compatibility tab is only available for programs installed on your hard drive. Although you can run the Program Compatibility Wizard on programs or setup files on a CD-ROM or floppy disk, your changes will not remain in effect after you close the program. <br>  For more information about an option on the Compatibility tab, right-click the option and then click What's This. <br>  Update your program or drivers<br>  If your program does not run correctly after testing it with the Program Compatibility Wizard, check the Web for updates or other fixes, as follows:<br>  <br>  Check the Web site of the program's manufacturer to see if an update is available. <br>  Check Windows Update to see if a fix is available for the program. Click Home on the menu bar of Help and Support Center, then click Windows Update in the right pane. <br>  If the program is a game that uses DirectX, ensure that you are using the latest version of DirectX. In addition, check the Web site of the manufacturer of your video card or sound card to see if newer drivers are available for either of them.|`|AA12054896	Which video game and what is the problem?

The problem is that many programs, adware, back doors, cookies, dialers, hijackers, key loggers, spyware, thiefware, trojan horses, viruses, worms, and zombie pcs set themselves to start automatically when Windows starts. As more and more programs are started automatically, your computer's valuable resources are drained, thus making your computer start to operate slow. This database will allow you to search for programs that you find starting automatically on your computer and determine if they are considered to be malware (harmful), unnecessary to run, or necessary to run. To examine your computer for programs that are automatically started by Windows, you can download and install Autoruns by Sysinternals. You can then search for entries found in the programs output using this database to determine if the program should be running.

Mp3 is a much safer file when it comes to things like virii. Besides, its much easier to convert a mp3 to a track on an audio cd while maintaining cd quality. Hope this helps!

If they want is another question.  <br>  <br>  If what you have is that important then you can't allow others to have access to it.  <br>  <br>  Just ask Mrcrosoft,  they have been trying for years ti figure out how to keep people from copying their OS.  Here I can buy XP Pro or home for less than a ten dolar bill.  They do work.  Most people here do use them.  <br>  <br>  Either let people use it and not worry about what they do or keep it away from others.

Such a software actually "keeps track" of every button or mouse movements so you know what was being done to the files or whether they were copied, etc.<br>  <br>  2.  Install a software that locks your selected  files and folders.  However by doing so, this doesn't give your users access to those files you want them to work with.<br>  <br>  3.  Remove all Nero or buring or ISO-makng software from your computer.  This may reduce the risk of any copying.<br>  <br>  4. "Protect" your exe  or reduce chances of your .exe of being decompiled by tunring your exe application into "shareware" (good for only a limited time).  So the chances of them being (wanting) to be copied to elsewhere is reduced.<br>  <br>  5.  Get a hardware expert to limit copying (eg. no copying by using right-click of the mouse, for example).  This isn't a foolproof way if they know the "long-cut" buttons to use for copying.<br>  <br>  6.  This may be the best solution but requires $$$.  You may want to ask a programming expert that can help in encrypting certain files that would render the whole exe useless if it's copied into another environment.  Pliagirisers may find copied material useless after being copied elsewhere.<br>  <br>  You can find such programmers at elance.com and rentacoder.com  <br>  <br>  Sorry - I don't have any much more info to help you prevent users of your computer from copying your files.

8e16a9af575834dcd917a9dbcf55b1dfaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  This is a windows XP thing.  It has something called a "System Restore" feature.  <br>  <br>  This is a hidden area on your hard drive that, everytime you do something to the computer, a delta backup is kept.  So that, if you do something really stupid, you will be able to recover from it.<br>  <br>  If you "Right Click" on "My Computer" and goto "Properties" you will see a tab called "System Restore"  I am sure it is turned on and by default, your system is set to use 12% of your hard drive space for this function.<br>  <br>  Now, your issue.  It seems that you got a virus, and the only way to get rid of this virus is to either/and start your system in safe mode and turn off system restore during a virus scan.<br>  <br>  What happens is that this virus comes back most of the time, because you can not really do anything in the system restore area.  Deleting system restore frees up this space, effectively destroying the virus and everything else.<br>  <br>  Now, if you do this, you lose all of your system restore features from this point back.  No biggie.  I do not know many people who even know it is there anyway.<br>  <br>  Also, you may want to contact your antivirus vendor for a fix for your particular virus.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep me informed.

Nor can it stop an infected download from say a P2P program such as Limewire or Kaaza that the user may download.<br>  <br>  A firewall is useful to stop only one kind of infection vector (or entry point). That is to stop  people trying to remotely compromise your computer without the user clicking on anything or visiting a website. <br>  <br>  Think of a firewall as locking all your doors and windows while you are sleeping. It will keep the thieves, the bugs and the insects out,  but eventually those doors and windows will have to be opened, and these pests may get in. This is the point where real-time protection steps-in and works to kill the "pests". <br>  <br>  There are many other infection vectors for virus spyware, worms etc. that the firewall can not stop.

First, check to make sure that the PC is still responsive to the keyboard when the mouse stops working.  It is possible that there is a process running in the background that is using up your resources and eventually brings your system to a crawl.  That would leave your mouse moving, but not useful because Windows can't keep up with you due to heavy processing, or lack or memory to work with.  It's a long shot,  but I'd check it out if I were you.<br>  Since you switched to a different mouse, I doubt that the mouse is the actual source of the problem.  Windows probably went out to lunch and forgot to come back.

So if you purchased an ATA 133 or ATA 100 it will be able to connect and replace the existing hard drive....<br>  <br>  The BIOS last revision dates to 2002.... Could not find out what storage capacity it could handle.... So my guess is max of 160 GB... So most hard drives come with a floppy which has a cool application to partition, format, and manage the hard drive... I would see if 1) the bios sees the drive at all..., then 2) partition the drive into say 120GB partitions... This may help....<br>  <br>  It is always good to see what your system can handle before buying the hardware.. <br>  <br>  Now another option no one discussed it that you install the old hard drive and run the OS from the old hard drive and get an external USB hard drive case and USB connect the new drive to the PC....

6d5315204c020e3ba0d3a36df0ed2bb5aa	Well, there have been a great many answers, some good and some bad.  I like the answer where someone said "you don't need an antivirus and you might need a firewall", but that's not the whole story, either.<br>  <br>  As with any computer running any OS (Operating System), you really need to be careful about what you download or run from the Internet.  This is not just limited to executables, either; websites with Flash content or Javascript are also dangerous depending on the nature of the site.  So, yes, you don't need an antivirus program in Linux if you're responsible about what you download / run.  To the person that said that viruses "don't exist in Linux", you're completely wrong; viruses exist in all OS's, but they are MORE of a problem on Windows-based PCs.  If you're looking to use Linux for an extended period of time, then I would either install an AV program or I would be especially careful about what I do on this PC to avoid AV problems.<br>  <br>  Really, the firewall is much, MUCH more important than the AV, but the question should be "why" you need a firewall, not if.  Ubuntu is good about not starting up with too many unnecessary or vulnerable services running; other Linux OS's like Gentoo start with sshd (Secure Shell service), for instance, that could be vulnerable.  So, check and see what services are running and disable any that you don't need.  Then, to increase the security on your ports with stateful packet filtering, you would have a couple options.  <br>  <br>  There are a number of firewall products for Linux, one of which was Firestarter, if I remember right.  It has a graphical interface, so it's pleasant to the average user, and should be sufficient for your needs.  If you're looking to delve deeper into Linux and learn how powerful command line can be, then you'll want to read up on iptables; I configure our Linux firewalls at work with iptables and it has a great number of options.  Since it does have a reasonable learning curve, though, I'd give Firestarter a try.<br>  <br>  Really, the only question you should ask yourself when wondering how secure your PC needs to be is "what kind of communication will occur to / from my system, and do I need any of those?".  It takes a lot of reading and understanding about an OS to do security the right way... for the average person, a decent graphical firewall and some common sense should suffice, though.|`|8fca156e3aa3b4ab0d7393821fb374b6aa	you really shoud have that before you even come online yes download them|`|b235622e608e184dcb231ac247fd7ba5aa	NOT necessary, unless you make a hard drive partition for DLs.<br>  <br>  There is no virus in GNU/Linux, and the Anti-Virus programs in MAC OS, BSD, and Linux are there to protect Microsoft users on a network!<br>  <br>  I find virus, download them,  look at them, but, delete them, but, I can see where a windoze unit could possibly get it on the network.<br>  <br>  I only have one XP Pro box on this network, of 12 Linux and 5 Macs systems.  more in the wings... but, it dims the lights to turn on too many...<br>  <br>  You should really try out <a href="http://pclinuxos.com" rel="nofollow">http://pclinuxos.com</a> which is a LiveCD.

[Depending on how you use it, little or no consequence.]<br>  <br>  Comment back and post how you plan to use the livecd- short jaunts or long term 24/7 use, etc.|`|AA11634194	I would say it is not necessary at all if you are running from a Live CD as the local file systems are mounted read only by default. Moreover, there is a default firewall, iptables, on most Linux systems that comes along. So, both AV and Firewall are unnecessary.|`|bafa820adaaa4cf861c7e5853a049cd4aa	My answer is a conditional yes. <br>  <br>  Even if the Linux is booted temporarily, a connection to the internet which is open is an invitation  to corruption. If you use a Linux browser, you can still pickup viruses and trojans and you can still affect your disk or your local network by exposing it to the internet. <br>  <br>  As an analogy, I would ask you if there is ever a time that you will leave your front door of the house wide open and unlocked in a questionable neighborhood? You may say no, except when I am entering and leaving and when I am moving something into the house...then I will prop the door open and leave it while I move in and out. ....OK, but would you walk away from the door and leave it unattended in that case? What if you used the bathroom or were moving into the basement? Ahhh, in that case someone could sneak in and out without your knowledge...and likely would given that the door is open. <br>  <br>  Such is the nature of the internet. For me, I opt to keep my doors locked and secured and have someone inspect the security periodically. "Your mileage may vary"

Download the Google Toolbar. It comes with a free pop-up blocker. Works EVERY time. If not Google, then download the Yahoo Toolbar with the free pop-up blocker. Google gets it first though. I ran a test to find out which is better. I downloaded both and used the Yahoo test page which opens it's own pop up, and Google got it before Yahoo did.<br>  And Mozilla Firefox web browser is an alternative too. It has a pop up blocker, and if you can't veiw a page with explorer, use Firefox. It's free, and it's only the second most targeted for viruses.

You want to format and delete an NTFS partition, but you don't need to format an NTFS partition (or any other, for that matter) to delete it.  Also, you say that the NTFS partition has "no any" files on it... really, it doesn't matter if the NTFS partition has files on it or not if you're just wanting to delete it.  The easiest ways to delete an NTFS partition would be to either use a Windows 98 startup disk or a Windows XP install CD.  From a Windows 98 startup disk, you'd use the fdisk command to remove any partitions you don't want; with NTFS partitions, I know Windows 98 won't see them as NTFS, but I think the fact that they see them as unknown will still let you delete them.  The clearer way would be to use a Windows XP install CD... when you boot off of that, it will go through its process and let you modify the partition table before it actually installs.<br>  <br>  If the NTFS partition is not the only partition on the drive, then your operating system will have built-in capabilities to add/delete partitions.  Windows allows this type of activity through its DIsk Management console in the Administrative Tools (also reached by clicking Start, right-click My Computer, click Manage, and click Disk Management, under Storage).  Linux or Unix allow this type of activity through the fdisk command.<br>  <br>  There's no need to format a partition before you delete it because removing the partition will render the data on the partition useless, anyways.  Of course, if any of this doesn't answer your question, then you need to phrase your question better.|`|7c82344dccd8cdc0a900bef0ae4eeef6aa	You can do one of 3 things.<br>  <br>  1. Put you windows xp disk in at start up and use the installer format utility to modify your partitions.<br>  <br>  2. Download Partition Magic and use that to modify your partitions.<br>  <br>  3. Download and burn Gparted which is linux's partition manager and modify partitions this supports a great array of partition types from ext3 (linux's file system) to NTFS and FAT32.<br>  <br>  The safest to my experience since I havent used partition magic and I believe you have to pay for it, I would suggest number three over all and one second.|`|cd04f4728e4c4606b1e860f02dd3e3afaa	You can use the Disk Management tool to do this.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your exact needs are, but typically you delete (remove) one or many partitions, create new partition(s), and then format any new partition.<br>  <br>  Right click 'My Computer' and select 'Manage'<br>  Expand the 'Storage' part of the tree<br>  Click on 'Disk Management'<br>  Find the partition you want to delete, right click and select 'Delete Partition' or 'Format'<br>  <br>  Then you can use this same utility to create a partition from the free space (this process will allow you to format the new area)
743170c0031bdef9d8c1ac03a7c66f04aa	Floppy disks, also known as floppies or diskettes (a name chosen in order to be similar to the word "cassette"), were ubiquitous in the 1980s and 1990s, being used on home and personal computer ("PC") platforms such as the Apple II, Macintosh, Commodore 64, Amiga, and IBM PC to distribute software, transfer data between computers, and create small backups. Before the popularization of the hard drive for PCs, floppy disks were typically used to store a computer's operating system (OS), application software, and other data. Many home computers had their primary OS kernels stored permanently in on-board ROM chips, but stored the disk operating system on a floppy, whether it be a proprietary system, CP/M, or, later, DOS. Since the floppy drive was the primary means of storing programs, it was typically designated as the 'A:' drive.|`|68987bf06c72365658d1b5e20bc9b5e8aa	compaq is now owned by hp|`|f4e14450d07448a4a048a7386ae80066aa	Yes.....?|`|1fb7499e188c243d1400b18907682593aa	sorry i dont know if you have a compaq or not with out looking at it...|`|4bb30c732da772897f58af547a94f6b5aa	?|`|7e0a841635b02490a0706e99fa3f89b9aa	what about it ...<br>  what do u want to know about it its a useless|`|863b947aa8fb9ad534dc3dbda3829946aa	compaq = useless prefab and prefabs suck build your own.

The power to your old-style wired phone comes FROM the central office (CO) through the phone line.  Things like dial-tone and ring voltage both are generated from the CO and don't require local 120V power.  This works out well, cause sometimes when the power goes out...you need to be able to dial 911.<br>  <br>  Another good reason to keep a non-wireless phone around just in case.  : )|`|9b16f43da95bb96ad136f348969e24b4aa	Because the telephone company has auxiliary power just as hospitals do.

AA12054896	Scaling talks about the reduction(down-scaling) or enlargement (up-scaling)of a picture.(this can be by size, dpi, or by pixels)  if you have a 5x7 picture and you want to scale it to a 8x10 this is possible, but the resolution will be affected as well and will drop as you continue to enlarge, for a printed file it is a good idea to keep your DPI above 300. For an Internet file a 72 DPI is acceptable. The same happens when you reduce your file or picture the picture will become smaller but the resolution will increase. <br>  <br>  When you reduce you do not have to worry much about the way the picture will look but when you enlarge you have to be careful not to enlarge to far which will create gaps in the pixels which the computer will then fill in with what it thinks is the best color creating a blurry image, pixelated image, and a poor quality print.|`|c0bb7db47873f4c10aec48db6f7c98a4aa	Look up "scaling" in the dictionary... all will become clear...

a94cf32cbccc9ec332bcc25492b34847aa	Entre no site baixaki e fa?a o download do GOM Media Player<br>  <br>  Na Coréia do Sul este player multimídia chega a ser mais popular que o Windows Media Player. Isto porque ele é totalmente gratuito e tem suporte para formatos como AVI, DAT, MPEG, DivX, XviD, WMV, ASF e outros. E mesmo no caso do programa n?o encontrar o codec adequado para algum arquivo, ele identifica qual falta e baixa-o de acordo com as suas necessidades.<br>  <br>  Outra vantagem do GOM Player é que nele você pode assistir a vídeos antes mesmo deles terem seu conteúdo totalizado, isto é, mesmo enquanto o download estiver em processo.<br>  <br>  GOM ainda é totalmente personalizável. Escolha, ou até crie, uma skin própria, troque a fonte e a cor das legendas, controle o contraste, brilho e satura??o das imagens dos vídeos, selecione codecs a serem utilizados, atalhos no teclado para todas as fun??es do programa, redu??o de ruídos de vídeos, ajustes de áudio e muito mais.<br>  Une accolade|`|NSGdnxQZaa	Possivelmente o arquivo esta corrompido, se for o caso nao tem jeito, a nao ser deletar e baixar de novo.<br>  <br>  Para saber se é esse ou n?o o problema, sugiro testar o k-lite mega codec pack, eh um pacote que vem com varios codecs e um player bem pequeno, que costuma rodar os videos que possivelmente o windows media nao rode, mesmo com o codec certo.<br>  <br>  Depois de baixar e instalar, tente rodar no windows media player, caso n?o rode, tente o player que veio no codec, caso ainda assim n?o funcione, é bem provável que o arquivo esteja corrompido.

If your computer is showing  drives C and D both as local disks then your operating system is on the D drive.  You can also find out when you boot up your computer, it will have a message at the bottom of your screen about system restore or repair.<br>  One other thing you can try is to boot up in safe mode and see if you can do a system restore to before you ran the registry cleaner.<br>  If neither of these suggestions work then you will need to get a copy of XP and install it which means formatting the hard drive and all information will be lost.  You can try to copy the following files from another XP disk or computer hard drive that is running XP onto a floppy disk and see if they will copy onto your hard drive, it is worth a try before you have to purchase a copy of XP and reformat your hard drive.<br>  The files you need to copy are<br>  i386\ntldr c:\<br>   \i386\ntdetect.com c:\<br>  <br>  If they copy over once they are done reboot the computer.

vOQ5UaO9aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  If you want to know the person's identity based solely on IP address, then let me tell you frankly that the answer is YES - but with certain limitations or short-falls.  <br>  <br>  Had you asked "can I find out the specific location of the originating computer based on IP address" - the answer is YES - but not based on IP address information alone, there has got to be:<br>  1. Exact Date (calendar date) when it happened<br>  2. Exact Time (GMT) when it happened<br>  3. If there was actual e-mail involved - we need the:<br>      * Domain Key Signature<br>      * Received Date & Time<br>      * Received From<br>      * Originating IP<br>  <br>  Let me give you an example:<br>  If the IP address is a static IP address, for example - the IP address of a web server within a corporate office... then this location is very easy to find - simply because all static IP addresses are similar to a rented property wherein the landlord keeps relevant records of all his renters.  Many private homes of private individuals (using private computers) nowadays also subscribe (or "rent") static IP addresses.  Hence, if a person (or company) has a static IP address "rented" from Earthlink - then Earthlink knows all your vital information.  Therefore if you pursue a lawsuit against somebody who's IP address was "rented" from Earthlink - then all your lawyer needs to do is obtain a Subphoena from a Judge - to Subphoena all of Earthlink's customers who subscribed (or "rented") a particular IP address.<br>  <br>  But, in most cases... cyber crimes are committed using public computers... for example - in a public library or internet cafe or a starbucks coffee shop.  If this is the case - then pursuing a lawsuit against the cyber criminal will be very hard to do.  The IP addresses in public computers are DYNAMIC - which means - they change from time to time.  The IP address at this very second may not be the same IP address the following second (or any future fraction of time).  This is why you have to know the exact time stamp and exact dates when the suppesed cyber crime was committed.<br>  <br>  So, granting that you have the exact IP address on the exact time on the exact date - then you can get the exact ISP (provider).   Be careful, though, because - for dynamic IP's - who are sub-leased by many sub-providers, the information you may get is not the actual provider... but the sub-provider.  For example: AT&T will sub-lease an IP address to SBC/Yahoo!, and in turn SBC/Yahoo! will sub-lease the same IP address to DSL-Extreme, and in turn DSL-Extreme will sub-lease the same IP address to a small ISP company... then the information you may get is of the small ISP company.  Therefore, you start pursuing your case against the small ISP company instead of filing a lawsuit against AT&T.<br>  <br>  Ok, so you've got all the information as to IP address and ISP (provider)... can you get the actual street address?  YES - but it is not easy.  You have to file a complaint and in your case - since it involves Computer Intrusion (i.e. hacking) file an official complaint to:<br>  1. FBI Local Office <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/contact/fo/fo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/contact/fo/fo.htm</a><br>  2. U.S. Secret Service <a href="http://www.treas.gov/usss/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.treas.gov/usss/index.shtml</a><br>  3. Internet Crime Complaint Center <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ic3.gov/</a><br>  <br>  If you want to pursue or get the street address on your own, then be very careful - because you might step over or violate some privacy laws and end up getting arrested yourself.  Like I said, filing a formal complaint is the best way to go... although it takes time, effort and a lot of money to do.<br>  <br>  Given all the facts, I think pursuing the criminal or perpetrator who hacked into your e-mail is almost futile (almost impossible to accomplish)... so you better do this:<br>  1. Change your e-mail address or create a new one<br>  2. Using your new e-mail address, send a notification to everyone in your mailing list - telling them that you are using this new e-mail address... and to please dis-regard any e-mails they receive from the old e-mail address.<br>  3. If you can still access the old e-mail - please make sure to change the password immediately, then save all relevant e-mails, then dis-able or delete the account.  If it is a corporate e-mail address - then contact your e-mail administrator and have him disable your account.  If it is a Yahoo! or G-mail or any free mail service - then contact them and make them dis-able or delete your account.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps... cheers!|`|VHM0OxFyaa	Yes, an ip address is as good as a home address, even better b/c you can see which computer it came from.

Make sure you get a power supply that has enough connectors and is powerful enough to support your future hardware and a case tht has room for it.  400 watts is a good minimum but you may want more than that .Once again go to Newegg or some similar site and compare the different power supplies and cases.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can save money on the processor since even extremely low end CPUs give quite good performance for current programs and you can always upgrade the processor later (as long as the motherboard supports it). You can also get a cheap graphics card and upgrade that later.<br>  <br>  I think you are better off choosing your hardware yourself and having the store put it together rather than buying a prebuilt computer. If you do want to buy a prebuilt computer make sure you know the brand names and model numbers of ALL the different parts in it and check to see that they will support your future hardware [watch out for "good deals" have low quality motherboards/power supplies/other parts..

r094sOoBaa	1) Click the note on the floor to get the background to the game.<br>  2) Click down by the side of the yellow filing cabinet to get a little silver key.<br>  3) Click on the filing cabinet proper and collect blue screwdriver in the top drawer.<br>  4) Click on the calendar and flick through it until December and note the guy's birthday. <br>  5) Click the calendar again to reveal a secret panel on the wall.<br>  6) Unscrew the screws with the red screwdriver and then open the wall safe with the silver key. Collect the zippo lighter.<br>  7) Focus in on the clock and lift it up to reveal a gold key.<br>  8) Open the locked drawer on the filing cabinet and get the ripped up note.<br>  9) Focus in on the desk and using the guys birthday as the code open the padlock and get the snips. (remember to use the American format of the date)<br>  10) Collect the other ripped up note from the bin and then solve both puzzles by moving the pieces around.<br>  11) Focus in on the computer, the passwords are in the two ripped up notes. You need to put them side by side and then just read the three passwords off in a line (it's C3692, 6510 & QT4420)<br>  12) In the computer menu you need to read the details of the safe mode which allows you to cut the wire to the Sensor. I think it's safe mode 2.<br>  13) Start the safe mode and then you can cut the yellow wire without any ill effects.<br>  14) Hold the zippo lighter to the smoke alarm on the ceiling. After a moment or two the fire alarm will go off.<br>  15) You can now amuse youself by doing some of the pointless things.<br>  16) After a couple of minutes you'll hear the approaching sirens of the fire service.<br>  17) The firemen will then come and bang the door down (luckily the sensor is disarmed so the bomb will not go off) and rescue you.<br>  <br>  Some of the pointless things you can do are:<br>  <br>  1) Put the cross on the table by the candles, light the candle and pray.<br>  2) Take the poison table and watch youself die!<br>  3) Make some ice in the fridge.<br>  4) Fill the cup with water.<br>  5) Scratch your head about that leaking panel on the wall.<br>  6) Turn the tap on the water pipes.|`|051bc43ed8b4a646de8e11191302302aaa	1)Go over to the dresser and get all the items.Green screw driver,cup,cross,and the red screwdriver at the very bottom view.At the first person view click that tiny little crack on the left side of the dresser to get the gray key.Go over to the clock, click on the right side of it and get the battery and the key.Go over to the calender, click on the bottom right side of it until it shows a secret panel.(Look at the december page to discover a code.)Use the gray key to unlock the panel, get the lighter. Go to the small trash can and click on the pieces of paper inside of it.(Move the pieces around to discover another code.)Go to the laptop and type in this code,C36926510QT4420, do safe mode 2. Go back to the lock and the code is 1225.(Like the birthday date on the calender.)Get the scissors.Cut the yellow wire and there will be no effect because you did safe mode 2. Use the lighter on the fire alarm on the ceiling.(Note:the fire alarm looks like a circular panel.)The alarm will go off, and in about 3 minutes the fire men will come and rescue you. There, you beat the game.Congrats!    (You could've used the green screwdriver to open up the bomb to see how much time you have left.And there were useless things also like the cup,ice tray,cross. Enjoy!

It is true that building your own computer is the best way to get what you want but it is also more expensive. Just the Operating system alone  is close to $200 for XP or 2000, that dose not include any apps like word or excel, that will cost you another couple of hundred. A nice Processor will cost you $200-$300, you will probably want at least 512 of ram 1G would be better which will cost 512 DDR- $70, 1GB-$100. Monitor will be another $200. Gaming video card will be another $200. You have now overshot your budget and you still do not have the case, mouse, keyboards, power supply, ect...
