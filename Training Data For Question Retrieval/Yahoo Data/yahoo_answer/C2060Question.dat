20090205045936AARAr4l	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Has anyone had success in getting their email back on a suspended account?	Back before a year ago, if you got your account suspended, yahoo in all their wisdom decided to delete your entire email account as well - effectively "banning" you from all their services, not "suspended." They have fixed that more recently, where if your answers account got "suspended", yahoo wouldn't touch your email.      Has anyone had success in getting their email back on an old "suspended" account? I read on the Consumerist that one person in the comments was able to do so - but all 800 of his previous emails in his account got terminated. So yeah.

20090205060336AAWf8ol	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Advice sought on what can be done about a provocateur?	I have noticed a certain user recently posting in the LGBT area, where virtually every response includes the same biblical quotations from Leviticus and Romans on why homosexuality is an "abomination".  The LGBT section of Yahoo! Answers has been the site of the last twenty-something posts from this person. It seems obvious to me this person is trying to stir up trouble, offend people, pick a fight, or something like that.  Does this fit the description of 'trolling'?  What are the options for trying to get this person either banned from the LGBT section or from Yahoo! Answers altogether?  Or am I just over-reacted to something I find offensive?      Any advice you can offer would be appreciated.  =)

20090205072147AAx8AVQ	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Don't you hate it when answering a question....?	You read a question which you know the answer to but somebody has answered before you who has gotten it incorrect and obviously has no idea.      So when you submit your answer the person above you has blatantly edited his answer and copied yours to make out he answered it correctly first, then that person gets best answer and you are left feeling defeated and cheated.         Isn't this annoying or am i the only one? Am i overreacting?      It's really annoyed me, it's happened a couple times.

20090205081843AA3mXAe	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	What's the best category for the following question?	"I live with my parents and I don't drive. I'm 24. We live on a crop farm and we have our own gasoline that we pay 200 something a month for the local gas station to come out and fill the gas tanks.      A couple of friends take me to bible study and horseback riding and my parents specifically said to them that they can fill up for gas at my house for free.      They REFUSE! One of them was so low on gas she even refused to fill up at my house instead waited until she filled up in town when she was just passing the gas tank at my house.      Why is that? It's not diesel."
