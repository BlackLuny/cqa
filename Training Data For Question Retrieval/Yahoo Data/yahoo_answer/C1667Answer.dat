AA11937736	Someone was wrong.|`|KS2OHXCRaa	That is not true. Did someone try to compare prices at high end shops in France to the low end shops in UK?     Otherwise, even in Paris, I manage to buy 2 kgs of clementines for only 4euro. I don't think it's common to find the same being sold in UK for 2-3 GBP.

AA11496012	I doubt there is a cheapest day to fly out.  The airport is less crowded on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays compared to the weekends but the ticket price depends on where you are flying, how far in advance you are purchasing your tickets and if there is a Saturday night stay.    Since Tuesday - Thursday are less busy days for the airport, maybe you can get cheaper tickets on those days but don't be surprised if you don't.|`|J7HTo1psaa	Thursday.|`|NZlRe3Wpaa	tuesday|`|J3tv9OeVaa	Statistically speaking Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday are the cheapest, because that is normally when demand is lowest. Its a simple supply/demand issue. Holidays can change that though. As for flying  WITHIN town, I'm not sure :-)|`|a6eLmLxvaa	I am going to give you the only piece of advice that was given to me for finding cheap flights, and it works to this day... Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out BookMe dot com. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck!

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	You have to be in your college and yours sets the rules.  Some schools gave credit for completing the internship.  Some only give credit for the classes you can take (assuming you can get the time off).  I couldn't so I didn't get any credit for the internship.  Nearly half our group quit and went home so they didn't get any credit either.    College classes are offered on Fridays which is usually your only day off.  After working 70 hrs, many weren't able to wake up at 6 on Friday.  Though I've heard the hours have been cut a lot recently.    Ark has probably been there more recently than me.  When I was there the pay was $6 an hour and the rent was close to $70-75 a week to share an apartment with 6 girls.  Your apartment rent depended on how many you shared with but you don't get to pick.    The college program doesn't have anything to do with being a character.  That's a completely separate audition, and getting it is based on height weight and looks.    You apply for the Disney college long before you get there.    IMHO, avoid it like the plague.  I hated my experience.  Most of my group quit due to the hours.  Most of the Food interns broke bones and were wearing casts b/c of the OSHA violations.  Write me with any questions you have but I think the true point of the Disney "internship" (a word I use loosely) is so that you can go back to school inspired to finish so you never have to be that poor again.  I lose 10 lbs which I didn't have to lose.  With rent, I had several friends get paychecks for -15.  And the stupid mandatory roommate meetings that you have to take a day off work for.  BTW if something happens use your cell phone.  911 is blocked.  It sends you to the Front Desk which never shows up.  You think you are talking to 911 and are actually going to get medical help.  I recommend people run very very fast from this program.  You'll never be allowed to talk to anyone in your field.  I was in advertising.  My roommate wanted to be a vet and she worked at Animal Kingdom but wasn't allowed to talk to the vets.    For my group, this classified as the worst experience ever.  However that changes year to year.  The year before us had a great time.  The management changed and ruined it for us.|`|413b409fd96101be076b46f8aee41bf0aa	In the Disney College Program, earning college credit is optional, but if you want to earn college credit, your school has to approve it. If they don't, you can contact other schools about earning college credit.    And yes, you will have to work. Depending on whether or not you're taking classes for college credit, you might work as much as 50 hours a week for at least $7.21/hour. If you like working at Disney, you can always look at professional internships or part-time and full-time positions.
f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	The daily rate is much cheaper if you rent at the airport than if you rent for one day from your hotel.  Plus, you won't have to pay for a cab to and from the airport.    I put in a span of five random days in February on Dollar's site, and got a rate of $215 for a mid-size (which is actually their weekly rate).  You can also Google various rental companies along with the phrase "promo code" to find lots of discount codes that will give you an even cheaper rate.  We did a daily rental from the Flamingo years ago, and it cost over $80 just for the day!    So I would definitely recommend renting for the whole five days.  This would also allow you to do more site seeing around the Las Vegas Valley (not just on the Strip).    Have a great trip!|`|xif22nwoaa	Personally, I would just rent it for the trip to the Canyon.  I think having a car on the strip would be a major hassle, and it's easy to get around the strip using the bus, cabs, or the monorail.  And you can walk a good bit of it pretty easily, depending on where you're going.  Traffic on the strip can be rough, and I wouldn't want to be driving in it if I could avoid it.|`|ILZY7BD0aa	no|`|F1d4i4WSaa	I would rent for a day....if you get a chance go to Oatman, Az. This is just over the bridge at Laughlin,Nevada. Ask someone for directions....it is well worth the trip. It's like being on the Gunsmoke Set..back in the day. It's a small town with live burros that walk through the town and stores. They sell carrots there for you to feed them with or you may take your own. They have a couple of resturants. One is in the hotel at the bar. Clark Gable and his wife spent their honeymoon in this hotel and supposedly it is haunted. You can walk through the stores and look around. We ate at the resturant and had some guy singing to us. At the hotel they have ice cream cones for you to buy along with knick knacks and there is a public bathroom and you get to go upstairs and see the room where Clark and his wife spent the nite. If your planning on just taking one day trip then by all means just rent a car for a day. You can take the tram or bus or taxi's to Fremont Street. Which is a must while your there. We went on a Tuesday and the slots were VERY loose...went back on Thursday and they were very tight. But we enjoyed it very much. Make sure you go over to the Hard Rock and drive those simulator cars. You actually feel like your a nascar driver. We did it twice and it made me sick the last time. But the guys loved it. Have fun and while your at it I give you permission to bring back some of my money with you that we left out there. LOLOLOL  We rented a car on the internet...found it was the easiest way and we got a really good price too. Like Kathryn said...I would put in for a wk, a day, and 5 days and see what is the cheapest.|`|23dec2d4efc124bc20e7aed48ed80991aa	Rent it for the whole week, use thrifty, they are the cheapest.  Also if you rent a car, you don't have to stay on the strip, you can stay at a nice hotel off the strip if you like.  The best part about Vegas is that parking is free and you can get to most casinos from the back roads without going up and down the strip in traffic.  The last time I was there though in December, it was ghost town anyways, so it may not be so bad going up and down the strip.  With the car you can go to AZ, Hoover dam, etc etc.  It beats waiting in lines for a cab which can be quite lengthy some times.|`|0a77fc4ea3cd11663c40afe098d312f9aa	I would rent a car if I were you, the busses that go up and down the strip are crowded and take forever, and it's much easier to take a car, get onto the freeway and zip around to wherever you are going. It's great if you plan on going shopping as well since you then have somewhere you can store your items! There are plenty of parking lots, and each hotel has a free lot to park, or you can valet the car for free (you should tip though!). We've always rented a car when we go to Vegas and it's just much easier on the mind too!|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Renting a car would be convenient, but it can be pricey, but if you want, you can rent a car if you think it is needed.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Yeah .. go for it.    Rental cars are dirt cheap in Vegas. You will actually spend almost as much on a few cab rides,  then you will on a rental car for a few days.    My last trip to Vegas I spent 80$ on 4 cabs rides. A 3 day rental car is ussualy about 60-80$.|`|p8UAIAisaa	Your better off just renting it for the day, as trying to drive around the strip area can get pretty bad. I would take the bus or tram and even use a cab with 4 people its pretty inexpensive even to go downtown.    As far as renting cars, Hertz has locations at some of the strip hotels such as Ceasars, Bally's and the Flamingo. You can see if the hotel you are staying at also has a rental counter and try and reserve your car a little in advance to get a decent rate and make sure its available for when you want to use it.

4INE794zaa	There are mountains on the West Coast.....the Rocky Mountains. As a Canadian who lives in the North, I really don't get this whole "Its extremely cold" mentality. Where do you people get that from? Sure, its cold.....in the WINTER! Summers here are damn hot. Too hot for me. It hovered around 30 allll summer here. Spring is a regular spring, rainy, muddy, cool in the morning and evening, warm in the afternoons. Fall, same thing. The land does not turn into Tundra once you cross the US border.   Canadians tend to live in the Southern parts of the provinces, as that is where the major cities are, and people like to be close to other people, as well as the job market, the shopping, the entertainment......  We also have quite a strict immigration process, so not very many people get in per year, which accounts for our lower population.     Not to mention we are one of the world's best kept secrets.|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Ok... I'll help you out.    No.. most of Canada is not mountain... Just look at a topographic map of Canada... I'm sure you can find it online.  There's lots of shield country.. but not mountains.  Most of the mountains are in the West and go from the 49th parallel to the Arctic Ocean.    It's also not extremely cold.  It's very regional.  Some areas, yes, are extremely cold.  Other areas are warmer than most of the US NE.  Most Canadians live in areas that are extremely similar geographically and temperature wise to the Nothern United States.    So compare where most Canaidans live,... and compare that temperature to Michigan, NY, etc... you'll find there's not much of a temperature difference.      The reason Canada has a low population density... as a country... has to do with economic factors and sheer size.    Economically and geographically speaking... the Southern areas of the country are the most attractive.  The Northern areas are difficult terrain to construct on, and there's typically not an economic incentive to do so... unless you're talking about the diamond mines in NWT or the oil sands in Alberta..    Actually.. a good exercise... try and estimate the total area that 90% of Canadians live in.  Then calculate the population density of that area.  You'll find it's actually higher than most of the US West, and more on par with the US Mid-west.    Take the area of Southern Ontario and calculate the popluation density... you'll find it's very similar to Michigan, NY, etc.    So... given the size of Canada... you can then begin to understand why we have a low population density.|`|tq6fCjy1aa	Canada (the parts where people live and drive) are not much colder than the northern part of the USA, and British Columbia down near Vancouver is not all that cooler in winter than summer, with temperatures just a few degrees below freezing in the middle of winter.    The population is low because the living space of most Canadians is mainly within 120 miles of the USA border (and this area is not all that cold). North of that, you have colder climate where very few people live except the aboriginal first nation people who have their own culture independent of what happens down in Ottawa, Ontario.|`|unbaqWxKaa	Well, the distribution of Canada's population is not due to extreme cold.  Most northern American and southern Canadian cities share similar temperatures and weather throughout the year (for example, Seattle and Vancouver, Detroit and Windsor, and so on).    You should focus your research on the historical patterns of immigration to and settlement of Canada, starting in approximately the 17th century.
EJpiaCMQaa	No you can't bring alcohol onto the ship.  I've cruised with NCL before and it isn't allowed.  No, you don't need a formal dress for dinner.  NCL offers an optional dress up or not night on its seven day cruises, but not on its weekend trips.    Cruising is alot of fun.  There's always something to see and do.

5gm4u5qVaa	16 is the minimum age requirement for a driver's license.      However, at the age of 14 is when you can start learning to drive with a permit.  This requires an adult in the vehicle with you.      However, the exact laws that govern what you are able to do with your license depends from state to state.      Here are the laws for Iowa:     Once you have taken your driver's education class, which is pretty much required at this young of an age, you can request a school license, where you are then allowed to drive to and from school.  However, it is a restricted license and you can only drive to and from school as well as no driving at night, which is generally set at the hours of midnight to 5 am.  Also, in order to qualify, the six months prior to applying must be a clean record with no accidents or traffic violations.  I got my school license at age 15.    At the age of sixteen, you then qualify for an intermediate license.  Here you can drive between 5 am and 12:30 am without restriction. However, during the night hours: 12:30 to 5 am, an adult over the age of 25 or a family member over the age of 21 must be present.  A special waiver can be applied for due to work and school related circumstances.  The term "under eighteen" will appear on the license.    At the age of seventeen is when you can apply for a full license with no restrictions.  However, the card will state that you are under 21 in order to make it clear that you cannot buy alcohol.  Otherwise, you are now officially a driver and do not need supervision.    At the age of 21, you can update your license so that it no longer has that typescript "under 21" on it.      Most states have similar laws, but you'd have to look up the state in question to see if they have a slightly different take than Iowa.|`|1PGmB4JNaa	if you go to driving school you can get your permit by 15 and then liscence by 16 and we can drive to school with parking stickers but if you dont go to driving school you can get a liscence by 18|`|69ebdfa872907c9eb5cba61e41e731b8aa	yes they can... my nephew has his own car he is 16|`|lDHNGNHvaa	16 is when we get our drivers license.  when we are 15 and a half we get our driver's permits which we have to drive with a licensed adult in the car for 6 months.    so all in all, yes, high school students can drive cars in america.|`|zVjjI49Naa	yes high school students drive cars in america =]|`|vcVZ0IBKaa	It depends on what state you are in.

Here in California, it's 16 (I get mine in 13 days, I can't wait!!!). My friend in Idaho, who I'm older than, already has her license, the age is either 15 or 15 1/2 there. My cousin's in NY said it's 17.
2025693ba8ff49edc3b6bb9d3e3c3f62aa	Hi Alfred, I live in a place called Il Vallo di Diano.    It's off the tourist track on the basilicata-campania border about 2hours drive down the A3 autostrada south east of napoli.    There are many attractions near to my house.    The greek temples at Paestum  The angel's caves at pertosa  An old monastry at padula  The house where joe petrosino was born also at Padula.  The Vallo di Diano national park  Mountain top villages.  Sagre and feste gallore in the summer.  fantastic beaches from pollicastro down to maratea.    Italy is full of gems.

You can visit this church and descend a stairway to another church underground, the new church was built on top of the old, you can then climb down another set of stairs from the underground church and descend to a roman temple.... sounds pretty cool to me.

UQLNP6iyaa	As a UK citizen, presumably flying on a major scheduled or charter airline, you are eligible to participate in the US Visa Waiver program. This means that you fill out a green immigration form (I-94W) on the plane on the way over. When you hand it in at immigration, as long as all your paperwork is in order, they will stamp your passport to allow you to stay up to 90 days in the US. They'll also give you half the form back to hand in when you leave. Don't lose it and be sure to hand it in when you check in for your flight home as they try to marry up the inbound and outbound portion of the forms and the date they were received in their systems. If they cannot do so, it can cause delays when you come back to the US.    When traveling to the US it's also a good idea (and possibly a requirement) to make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from the date of arrival.    You do not need a visa unless you are planning on working. If you do plan on working, contact the US Embassy Consular Section in London.    EDIT: The ESTA program was due to be initiated on January 12th, 2009. It has been suspended indefinitely for 2 reasons: 1. it doesn't work yet. 2. the current administration is reviewing the entire program and may scrap it.    Keep your eye on the US Department of Homeland Security website to see if you need to do it by the time your travel. Even if you do, it won't be required until 72 hours prior to departure.|`|d0ff48441cb372a53ded2d0fa9ac55bfaa	Being a citizen of western Europe, you will get your 6 month tourist visa when you check in at American immigration.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	You can visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without a visa under the visa waiver program.  You must, however register for the visa waiver program pre-screening system called ESTA.  See site below for the info you need.

1Vih78dZaa	The site which Venice now occupies was originally a few low, marshy islands in a shallow, salt water lagoon. It was difficult to build houses there, but the place was chosen because it was easy to defend and easy to see hostile forces approaching from a long distance away.    In these conditions, it was difficult enough before modern times to construct buildings above the water, never mind build tunnels underneath it. In fact, all the old buildings and bridges in Venice have foundations which consist of thousands of wooden pilings driven into the sand at the bottom of the lagoon.     There are many underwater tunnels in the world, so it would theoretically be possible for there to be tunnels under Venice. However, all underwater tunnels are difficult to construct and the conditions in Venice with the seabed being mud and sand rather than rock would make doing so there particularly challenging. Also, if you wanted to build a tunnel below Venice you would have to make sure that none of those millions of wooden posts were disturbed by the work underneath.    Many buildings in Venice are already in a fairly fragile state and have suffered the effects of the ground settling underneath them over the centuries. Building a tunnel below them could well bring them crashing down.|`|eulMjLtPaa	No. It's a salt marsh.
1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	Go to any Brooklyn beach (Brighton Beach is the best) and make fun of Russian men in speedos.  It's even better if you actually speak Russian.  I'm kidding (it is actually fun, but I think you need to break yourself into the city before truly learning to appreciate it).  How old is your son - it sort of depends on his age.  Go to Greenwich Village, if you like the arts - there are all sorts of fun, trendy gallas and galleries there that you can just walk into.  Another great thing about the Village is that there are always fliers advertising arts shows, music shows, comedy clubs, so you can literally walk the neighborhood and find something.  The Met is another obvious - it's a little touristy, yes, but I've lived in Brooklyn my whole life and still spend an occasional Saturday there.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	steal hubcaps, mug old ladies, stab cashiers at convenience stores, rob single moms, etc|`|dGLuEFyKaa	Usually they stuck in traffic...|`|019e9ad03907f75846fcc35e167f393faa	Here are some top tips   1.Take the Staten island ferry ,It's free, yes free and it goes right past the Statue of Liberty .  2. Go to Century 21 it's a department store near Ground zero,Designer gear and fantastic prices ,there are some times street hawkers outside selling copies for the same price as you can get the real thing inside .  3.Go to the Natural History Museum ,They give you a sugested entry price and then you pay what you want to pay ($1 each is OK)  4.Use the subway $2 per journey each if you miss your stop you can get on another train and go back with out paying any extra,the map seems complicated at first but it's not that bad.  5.Don't buy your suvenirs from the actual places get them from the shops in Little China or from the Hells Kitchen area where they are more reasonably priced.  6 If you are going to see a Broadway show ,go to the ticket booth under the Marriot on Times square when it opens (see number 9) for 50% discount tickets ( these are proper tickets for decent seats ) I got front row for half the price of those at the back.  7.Go to Joe's dinner in Brooklyn for a good meal and fantastic cheesecake.  8.On the subject of food ,eat where the locals eat .A good breakfast will set you up for the day so you don't have to stop half way through the day to find food.  9. Grayline buses run a great sevice you can choose from 48 hours all loops witch means you can hop on and off any where on there circuit for 48 hours ijncluding the nighttime tour or you can go for the three day all inclusive tour which we thought would have been a bit to much .There operatives gave us some realy good local hint and tips

The link below will take you to the Mileage Run section of the FlyerTalk forum, where tricks and tips to adding extra segments on trips (for the exact reason you describe) are discussed.|`|J3tv9OeVaa	Used to, but because of the falling value of the mile and the unwillingness of airlines to think in terms of customer service I pay extra to fly direct. I just want out of that flying tube of customer neglect as soon as possible.    Flying became too cheap too fast. Looking forward to a few of the "majors" (insert derogatory term here) to go out of business, so price and quality both increase.

f2b9bac6ba2f1b4719753cb0987d5d4faa	In the US the laws are rather weird re: flight attendants.     Heck they get offended if u call them an Air Hostess!    In other parts of the world, they put the laws aside and use sexism all the way to lure you into their airline!|`|J3tv9OeVaa	I would add that on Lufthansa they seem to take a unique approach. They don't care about looks, but are careful to choose snarly personnel who have no idea what customer service is.     Like almost anyone else, I could care less about appearance; its competence that matters.|`|6rCbzw6oaa	AMAZING PERSONALITIES!?!?!?, AA HAS THE WORST MANNERED ATTENDANTS EVER!|`|SLFt8eHEaa	I think it's because American airlines (as in all of them generally, not the airline American Airlines) have a policy of seniority by which you have to work your way up to being a flight attendant on international flights.  Therefore by the time they get to fly internationally (and thus be compared to flight attendants from other countries) they are a bit older than those from other airlines (most other airlines don't have these policies) and have maybe 'lost their looks' a little.  It also explains why you may have found their service better - they have plenty of years worth of experience by that stage.|`|vzqWUq2Waa	I'm not sure, but I'd rather have a rather plain-looking flight attendant who is helpful and funny than a hot one who is always bitchy.|`|2KjBXjLKaa	It has a lot to do with too many lawyers and too many laws in the USA. That and the need for management to be politically correct (PC) is the reason the USA does not have as attractive attendants.|`|VlhmbHGGaa	This isn't just American flights.    I've experienced "old" staff at British Airways, Scandinavian Airlines and Lufthansa. Most countries have laws against age discrimination. They can't fire people just because they get old.    And I really appreciate experienced crew, they know their stuff.
aRC5NqTjaa	Telluride is absolutely gorgeous, especially when it's snowing. It's a small town; one main street with a few satellite streets coming off it. You can walk anywhere in town. The skiing is wonderful, and there's a great restaraunt in one of the hotels that looks down on the runs. It's pricey, but delicious! We have family friends who live there, and try to come up every time we can. The town is situated in a little valley, surrounded by mountains, so even if you're not big into snow sports, the scenery will make the whole trip worthwhile. Have fun!

TRTed54Maa	Most Countries in the World thrive on Tourism, as it brings vital money into the economy and improves the average standard of living. This is why Asian countries like India, China and Indonesia have been promoting tourism in recent years. The Balkans are also proving popular choices for the Brits, Germans and Swedes, instead of Spain and Italy.    However, tourism can bring down effects. But not by overcrowding, water shortage, leakage???? WTF? Do you mean like sewage pipes bursting LOL? And social; doubt it.|`|CscImglyaa	I would agree that tourism is vital to the healthy economy of many resort areas.  The problems often occur for the working class in these areas, higher prices with the influx of wealthy tourists and second home owners ( especially real estate prices).  Supply and demand.      Over crowding and water shortage, I have seen this happen when people start flocking to an area, developers start to build more homes while the towns do not have the infrastructure to support the growth.  This seems to have happened in many places in this country, resort areas or not ...

AA11937736	The Prfecture de Police museum at 4 rue de la Montagne Sainte-Genevive in the 5th arr. police station is interesting and someplace that almost nobody ever goes to. (I've never seen anyone else in it). It has a webpage in English here: http://www.prefecture-police-paris.inter...    The Musee Carnavalet at 23 rue de Sevigne is somewhat better known but still largely overlooked. It is devoted to the history of Paris.    The Muse d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris at 11 avenue du Prsident Wilson has an interesting collection that often gets overlooked by fans of modern art who think that the Centre Pompidou is THE modern art museum in Paris.    The Muse de l'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris at 47 quai de la Tournelle is another strange little place which has the  history of Paris hospitals since the Middle Ages.    The Muse de l'Homme in the Palais de Chaillot at 17 place du Trocadro is anthropology, ethnology, and prehistory.    The Muse du Vin at Rue des Eaux - 5 square Dickens presents the history of, that's right, wine.    Not a museum but still something very cool to do is to go to one of Jim Haynes sunday dinners. Jim is a fascinating person and has been doing these sunday dinners for years. Read all about it here: http://www.jim-haynes.com/index.htm    Also on the list of cool things to do is the Friday night skate thru Paris.

If the roads are going to continue to get more and more hazardous as time goes on then by all means get home safely when you can.     Staying would depend on if you'll be able to get home safely, what you'll earn today, how much you'd enjoy staying and the potential consequences for not staying. (Which if NO ONE is there i doubt they'll be severe... but you should know better than a stranger would.)

AA11044780	Well, Mary's experience sounds outdated as far as the room goes, and a bit off in terms of the restaurant.  The pricing looks about right though.  The hotel is old- its Ohio's oldest inn, and has hosted a number of presidents, as well as Mark Twain and Charles Dickens.  So the rooms arent super modern, but at the same time, they just finished a multi-million dollar renovation late this summer, which has the place looking better than ever.  The restaurant is very good, and has a great reputation throughout the Cincinnati area.  I have always enjoyed the meals there, although I have to admit, its certainly more popular with the older crowd (and yes, I do mean crowd, they pack the place full).|`|uCqxkEhUaa	http://www.goldenlamb.com/index.php?page...    They range from $100 - 200 per night!|`|JxCXqKaVaa	Go to the hotels website, you can check prices, unavailability etc on there.|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	It cost my husband and I $113 for the Charles Dickens room, but I don't recommend it.  We had a great time shopping in charming downtown Lebanon but the room was awful.  It faces the street and was bathed in light from the streetlights and there was no way to close the drapes!  Also, the shower went out and they had to give us a key to use the shower in another room the next morning because they couldn't get it fixed until the next day.  The Dickens room in particular is terrible because it is right next to a stairwell, so between the bright light and people tromping up and down we didn't get more than 2 hours of sleep, and they were full up so we couldn't switch. Be sure you ask about the location of the room; don't get one facing the street or at the stairwell end of a hallway.  Also, the restaurant is very hit and miss with the regular menu being very limited.  I paid $25 for a steak dinner, a third of which was inedible.  As far as the prices, it depends on the room, call them or get on their web site. Hope you have better luck than we did!

(Northumberland has lots of castles within a small area in fact, it's probably the castliest part of England!)<br>  <br>  Churches: Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's cathedral in London, and I would also recommend York Minster and especially Durham Cathedral in northern England. Bill Bryson, in his capacity as ambassador for English Heritage, considers Durham Cathedral to be the finest church in the land, and I think he's right.<br>  <br>  I think the Northumberland national park, the Lake District, and North Yorkshire (the Yorkshire Dales especially) are the most beautiful parts of the UK.<br>  <br>  I recommend you don't get a tour guide and simply research and plan your own trip, you'll have a better time and are more likely to discover places "off the beaten path" as it were. I would only recommend a guide to a non-English speaking visitor who would seriously struggle without one.<br>  <br>  May I just stick up for Marks and Spencer - though it's a large chain of shops (every medium-sized British town has one, and London has many), it is probably the quintessential British middle-class shop and offers a shopping experience I don't think you'll find in any other country.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in the history of this company, and you're ever in Newcastle upon Tyne, I suggest you visit Marks and Spencer's Penny Bazaar in the Grainger Market, which dates back to Victorian times and is one of the original market stalls from the very earliest days of the business.<br>  <br>  Anyway, enjoy your stay, I hope you have a wonderful time!

jLTDqVHsaa	I am surprised that nobody mentioned my all-time favorite car ride activity:    Look out the window!!    Really, I have such vivid mental images of this country, gained by simply looking out the window and seeing what's out there over the years.    However, I'm realistic, I know that can get boring.  Some things to do:    -Take photos/videos  -Play games  -Listen to music (while looking out the window)  -Talk with other people in the car  -Eat  -Sleep  -Read  -Write  -Work on some sort of art or craft activity that you can do in a confined, moving space like a moving car.    Those are your options, really.  Of course, you'll be making rest stops, gas stops, and food stops, so it's not really 14 hours interrupted.  Not as bad as it sounds.    Get creative, you'll come up with some ideas.  I've always found ways to stay occupied in multi-week road trips that almost always involved 12 to 14-hour days.

xif22nwoaa	1. Many of the hotels I've researched look fabulous! Which are the best ones (nice, but not too expensive)?  It really depends on what you want.  Right now you can get great rates at many of the nice hotels.  Some nice places that aren't generally too high include Mandalay Bay, Luxor, MGM, Paris, and Mirage.  You'll want to consider location as well - the first 3 are at the end of the strip, while Mirage and Paris are more central.  But I also highly recommend Caesars and Venetian, and you can sometimes happen upon great deals at those places.      2. Can you visit other hotels you're not staying in for their shows and amenities?  Absolutely!  Checking out the other hotels is one of my favorite things to do.   You can't always use all of the amenities at the other hotels - many restrict pool use to guests only, for instance - but you can certainly eat in their restaurants, see their shows, gamble, shop, and sightsee at any hotel, whether you're staying there or not.      3. What are the best shows?  Some of my favorites have been Cirque du Soleil, Penn & Teller, Wayne Brady, and Elton John (his run may have ended).  Blue Man Group is also very cool.    4. What are some of the free attractions? Bellagio fountains can't be missed!  Some other free attractions include the Lion Exhibit at MGM, the volcanoes at Mirage, and the pirate show at Treasure Island.  For a moderate fee you can check out the Shark Reef at Mandalay, the Dolphin Habitat and Secret Garden at Mirage, and the top of the Stratosphere.  All are worth it!    5. Are the buffets good?  Some are better than others.  I love the buffets at Paris and at Rio.      6. Best pools? Mandalay Bay has a great pool - wave pool, regular pool, lazy river.  Very neat!  MGM, Caesars, Bellagio, and Flamingo also have pretty nice pools.  The pool scene at Hard Rock can be lots of fun too.    7. How much money should we take for 5 days?  That's so hard to judge because it really depends on what kinds of meals you'll be eating, what types of attractions you plan to see, how much you gamble, how much you drink, etc.  I would guess maybe $750-1000??  But it's really hard for me to say.  You should plan how you expect to eat (we usually do fast food or food court breakfast & lunch, then a nicer dinner), what shows you expect to see, and a gambling budget and go from there.  There's great shopping in Vegas too, so account for that if that's something that interests you!|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Pretty much there are many choices on what you can do in Las Vegas besides gambling. Las Vegas has good nightlife and good dining. There are many free attractions as well. I would recommend to have good discount coupons. the regular prices can be pricey, but its good to have discount prices on the foods, shows, etc!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I've been to Las Vegas several times and there's way more to Las Vegas than gambling.  First, to answer your questions:  1.  The Stratosphere is nice but not too expensive.    2.  You can go to any show in any hotel.  You can gamble, shop, visit attractions, and do anything else you want in any other hotel.  3.  Some of the best shows are Lance Burton, Legends in Concert, and Cirque du Soleil.  4.  The Bellagio Conservatory, The Fountains at Bellagio, the volcano eruption at The Mirage, Wildlife Habitat at the Flamingo Hilton, show in the sky at The Rio, Fremont Street Experience are some of my favorite free attractions.  5.  The Bellagio, Wynn Las Vegas, The Mirage, and The Rio have the best buffets.  6.  Flamingo Hotel, Mandalay Bay, Monte Carlo, and The Venetian.  7.  That is up to you.  I always take a little more money than what I need to be on the safe side.    I enjoy visiting Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire State Park when I'm in Las Vegas.  I also enjoyed the view from the top of the Stratosphere Hotel's Observation Deck.    Check out http://www.vegas.com|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	get married|`|j7vfbwVUaa	You will never be bored in Las Vegas. Not only is it affordable, and very luxurious but full of activities. You don't have to gamble or have a lot of money to have a great time.  Here is a list of free attractions  http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/free-attr...  Remember to see the Bellagio fountains and Fremont street at night.     Here is another list of more attractions  http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/lasvegas-...    1) Nice but not too expensive: Luxor, MGM Grand, Flamingo, Monte Carlo, Excalibur. However you need promo codes to get great rates there. Here are a few codes. http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/special.p...  2) The answer is YES  3) O @ the Bellagio, Le Reve @ Wynn, Blue Man Group @ Venetian, KA @ MGM Grand  4) Listed above with link  5) Most are good depends on your taste. Rio, Mirage, Wynn, Bellagio are great buffets  6) Mandalay Bay  7) $1,500|`|0a77fc4ea3cd11663c40afe098d312f9aa	I went to Vegas 4 times before I became legal in the US and I just can't stop heading back. Why would you go anywhere else when it's all in one spot, that's my thinking, haha!    1) Most of the hotels now are offering great deals because of the economic crisis, and since Vegas purely runs off tourism, you can probably find something. A great hotel to stay at for 1st time goers, in my opinion, is New York New York because you get a great hotel layout/design and it is on the end of the strip so it's very easy to get to from the airport and right across the street is the MGM Grand where you can catch the tram.    2) Absolutely! With the exception of maybe the pool areas, each hotels casinos, restaurants/buffets, shops, and attractions are open to the public.    3) The Cirque shows are by far the best shows, but they are the most expensive.    4) Each hotel has their own "theme", for instance, Treasure Island has a pirate fight outside its hotel every hour or so, the Bellagio has it's dancing fountains and walking garden, etc.    5) The buffets are amazing. My personal favourite was at the Wynn hotel, it seemed to have the freshest ingredients. Another good one is at Paris, because it is French themed, so it has a lot of good, rich food and bread.    6) Not too familiar with the pools myself, but each hotel has something to offer.    7) Depends on how much you plan on shopping. Vegas has 2 great outlet stores, so you could easily spend a few hundred $ in one go. the buffets are about $20 for lunch, $30 for dinner, if you're seeing shows buy the tickets ahead of time because they sell out quickly. if you do gamble, its amazing how fast $100 disappears!    I hope at least one part of this helps you out in your trip!|`|NMPQo1oAaa	are you kidding . !? Las Vegas its not only gambling . ! thare are other TONS  of things to doo . !     the thing that you really cant miss . is CRISS ANGEL'S MINDFREAK SHOW!   it is absolutley unbelievable . !    hope u have fun in there . !|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Wow, you are seeking a lot of information.  Quickly, you need to understand that getting around in Las Vegas can be a chore if you do not know what you are doing.  For the novice I strongly recommend staying right smack in the middle of the Strip.  For the best bang for the buck I strongly recommend the Venetian.  They have only suites and they are off the hook!  It is also in the middle of things.      Yes, you can visit every hotel and partake of their amenities (except the pool).  The Venetian has over five acres of pool area.  It is not the best but it is very nice.      Purchase your show tickets for the top shows before you go.  They are nearly impossible to get once you arrive.  For the regular shows, there is a ticket place on the lower end of the Strip right next to the giant Coke Bottle called tickets2nite.  After 10am they sell same day, half price tickets.      The best shows are any of the Circque du Solier shows, the Blue Man Group, any famous headliners or Broadway shows.  The best Buffets are at  Bellagio, Paris and Planet Hollywood.      Free attractions are literally everywhere.  The most popular appear in the evening.  They are the Dancing Fountains in front of Bellagio, The Sirens of TI Pirate battle in front of Treasure Island and the Volcano erruption in front of Mirage.    Contact me for more information.    *

xif22nwoaa	Bellagio is very fancy and up-scale, as is Encore.  Caesars is nice, but not nearly as fancy as the others.  It has a great location though.  Mandalay is pretty fun, but all the way at the end of the strip.    The only way to get comps is to gamble.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Dude you pick the best of the best!!! They are all awesome hotels, i picked CP and Bellagio due to being center strip. Hey i would be happy staying at either one of these places.    I) Ceasers  2) Bellagio  3) Encore  4) Mandalay Bay|`|mAV5MJQnaa	I would say Ceasers and Bellagio are pretty cool and nice to stay. Since its more high life. Encore and Mandalay Bay are nice too.|`|vwZvxNevaa	Definitely Bellagio|`|yvPA8FSsaa	I do not know what you mean by "coolest" or "nicest".  You see, it all depends on what you are looking for in a hotel.  Bellagio is top shelf but is older, the Encore is top shelf and brand new.  Caesars is in the best location of the ones you mention but the Venetian is in a better location and has only suites.  The same is true of Palazzo.      On the other hand all of the Hotels have premium level suites that are far superior to the regular rooms.      That all being said, the most expensive and exclusive of all the Hotels in Las Vegas is the Four Seasons.  You will not find it on any Strip Map.  It is on the top floors of Mandalay Bay.      *|`|VlrlOz9Faa	I've stayed at all of them and for things to do, I'd say Mandalay Bay or THE Hotel on top of Mandalay Bay.  For nicest, I'd say the Bellagio.|`|JorA6muvaa	Bellagio or Cesears are bot nice

KmTyREP9aa	G'day mate,  According to the latest Agricultural Production statistics, released by Statistics New Zealand's Agricultural Production team, there were 40.1 million estimated resident sheep at 30 June 2006, which means that the sheep-person ratio has halved in the last 20 years, and now stands at 10 sheep per person.

B5Y46XBoaa	The advantage would be that they could terrorize the Israeli's more easily if they lived among them and in doing so they could possibly gain total control of the Jewish Holy Land and rule over the Jews as they once did; which is what they really want. <br>  <br>  Please note there is no talk of the "right of return" for the 1,025,000 Jews that have been expelled from the newly created Arab countries since 1948, nor is there any talk of paying those people or their offspring any compensation for the homes, land, businesses and possessions that they were forced to leave behind.|`|iCMrsV9daa	Palestine, what palestine? palestine what palestine?

They would expect the usual safeguards against racial,ethnic and religious discrimination. It is time for Palestine-Israel to join the 21st century. Under whatever name,so long as it is a modern rather than a tribal state.|`|1b47d266c534a22e56fed1ec2c0bf117aa	It will be good if Palestinians in exile would return, kick out Hamas and erect a stable government devoid of terrorism and worthy of compromise.|`|QgE85Qynaa	You've hit the nail on the head, though "awkward" perhaps is too mild a term.<br>  <br>  While this does present a problem (especially as much of the land exiled Palestinians once lived on is now occupied by Israelis), Al-Awda (Right to Return) Leaders claim that despite the obvious obstacles, they have a right to return to their homeland.<br>  <br>  As has been evidenced by the recent Gaza-Israel war or even the first and second Intifadas, the Palestinians do indeed consider their Israeli neighbors to be enemies and invaders. Nonetheless, Palestinians believe they have a right to live in Palestine and will, until they die, continue to attempt to return. The Arabs, like most Eastern and African peoples, adhere to a belief in honor. Comfort has little to do with it. Palestinians would probably be more comfortable living as semi-refugees in neighboring Arab countries than citizens in their own land, however, it is more HONORABLE for Palestinians to be citizens rather than refugees and so, regardless of the comfort or discomfort, Palestinians attempt to return their homes.<br>  <br>  As far as the advantages of this move, the benefits are nearly countless. First and foremost, Palestinians will have gained honor by returning to their homes (and as I've mentioned, honor is everything). Secondly, Palestinians outnumber Israelis by a nearly six to one ratio. By returning, Palestinians would simply be able to topple Israel through weight of population (Israel would be forced to redraw its borders according to population, and those borders would be almost too small for Israel to function as an independent state- one of the reasons the current state of Israel has been eager to create outposts and settlements).|`|0StmErZBaa	Believe me, they couldn't even find these people.

6qsTmMQaaa	Wow! I could go on and on and on and on about things you could do in the big city, but I won't, due to a limit of how much I can write. I guarantee you that no matter where you go, you will have a blast, because New York City is one of the best places to visit! I will list for you some fun things that you can do, and I will give you some websites and/or street addresses to some good restaurants, clubs and other fun activities.    While in New York, I STRONGLY suggest you go to see a fun show called Fuerzabruta in downtown New York. It is very fun! It's almost like a club, but there's no age limit! In the main lobby, there is a bar for refreshments, and there are souvenirs of the show, like little key chains and t-shirts. Here is the official website >>> http://fuerzabrutanyc.com/    Listed below are some excellent restaurants you should definitely try out.

I don't even do half of my shopping in New York; I do it in either Paramus, New Jersey or online. However, I did find a website where you can find some different places to shop, and you can narrow it down with what you want to shop for: http://www.ny.com/shopping/  Remember that these shops can be anywhere in the city, so be willing to go to Queens if need be.    As far as attractions, there are a lot of things you should go to see. You should definitely try to go see the Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. The website Im giving you is for directions to the ferry station, where you can go see Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. Unfortunately, the interior of the Statue Of Liberty is closed, but the wonderful statue is beautiful. The website is here >>>> http://www.ny.com/transportation/ellis.h...

Also, for transportation, there are maps in subway cars and on subway trains, and there are also maps in buses. The maps at bus stops are usually just for the bus route.    I hope this guide has helped you, and I hope you enjoy the many wonders you will find in New York City!|`|WUBZrmXzaa	Here's a pretty good list to get you started -- you should be able to do all this and more in 3 days if you make the most of your time.

Museum of Natural History  Wax Museum in Time Square  Manhattan mall - for some shopping.  Empire State Building  Statue of Liberty  Take the sight seeing bus - you can find those in time square.  If you're going to see a show, go to the TKTS booth in Times Square, but get there early in the morning or you'll have to wait in line all day.  Brooklyn bridge    Shopping:  Century 21 - by ground zero  Manhattan mall - broadway and 34th street  5th ave - desiner stores - between 50st to 59th st  Time Sqauare  China town  Time warner center has a mall - by columbus circle    Nightlight: Check out this site for all type of clubs.  http://www.ny.com/nightlife/      Hope this was helpful.

Macy's have a huge shoe department.|`|c528fbd7ec89bcc92edbebcb5d4638a4aa	If you only have a couple of days here, take one of the double-decker bus tours. Even though it sounds touristy, you can see many neighborhoods and get off to roam around the ones you like, then hope back on. Times Square is great, esp. at night, but most of the restaurants are tacky chains you'd find anywhere.  For both cities, I'd go on citysearch.com and check your own interests. It's important to lay out the places your going to visit in advance so you don't waste time backtracking and being stuck in lines. Below is a good map you can plan with. The subways are safe and fast for getting around. Grand Central is a hub and a beautiful station. Central Park is huge, but there's the Strawberry Fields Memorial across the street from John Lennon's apt. bldg. There's museum mile on 5th Avenue from 79th St up right on Central Park's east side. The Natural History Museum is on the other side of the park. with such a small window of time, you'll just get a taste, but have a great time!

vl6OtBfWaa	I live in Montreal and have for most of my life.    I would say the advantages are many stuff like having all the cool things a large city brings like museums and live music theatre and a range of cultures and cuisines and languages also having four distinct seasons is an advantage to some and a drag to others (I hate winter )    There is always something to do like cultural events and stuff like the jazz festival comedy festival film festival beer festival this year we had the Grey Cup (canadian football championship) the NHL all star game and the Montreal F1 race also a nascar race.    The disadvantages are also numerous there is a debate over language here french versus english there is a lot of snow (I hate winter)     You are farther from the country here to walk in the forest or on the land is difficult you are far from fishing or hunting (if you like that stuff)  there is higher crime and visible poverty.   The city can be dirty and hard to navigate at times there is noise pollution and air pollution and traffic and stress and predjudice.  Higher taxes less services because of inefficient government .    The list goes on and on.  But overall I am a city guy and love it here    Hope it helps.|`|7GH4vEjIaa	advantages:   -Mtl is the perfect size "Not too big and not to small..."

Go to the Air Canada website and enter some flight dates and you'll get itineraries that show the flight times as well as lay overs.  Expect something on the 7-10 hour range.
NK3VJgiRaa	Actually Puerto ricans Do pay federal taxes. They pay taxes like medicare, SSI, etc. So if there are any tax cuts from those taxes, it will be reflected on your paycheck. Puerto ricans do Not pay federal Income tax. So whatever is cut on those taxes, you will not see (unless you work for the US govt in PR). So you might see some extra money in your pocket, but not $65 it will be less.|`|sZGzUmLDaa	yes puertoricans are included because they are part of USA|`|vQ90SLfOaa	Puerto Rico are not in the Federal Tax system.  Therefore Puerto Ricans do not pay Federal Tax.  Since there is no Federal Tax paid, there is obviously no Federal Tax CUT.  So they answer is NO, Puerto Rican's will not benefit from the Federal Tax Cut.  <br>  <br>  Puerto Rico does benefit from the increases in social spending of the plan (Medicare, Social Security, Food Stamps, etc..) signed by President Obama, and the money targeted for improvements to the infrastructure.  But Puerto Ricans per se will not see a cut in their payroll taxes, unless the Commonwealth government (the local IRS, called Hacienda) decides to lower the tax rate in response to Federal dollars coming in.<br>  <br>  -- LouCar<br>     <a href="http://prwest.com" rel="nofollow">http://prwest.com</a>|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Yes we are included.

A5ZQmmW1aa	I don't live in Chepstow but go there quite often.  It has very good transport and road links, so it's easy to get out and about.

c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	They should outlaw lap sitting entirely.  Even a short flight can encounter turbulence, ands then your baby becomes a ballistic object.  There is no way for a human to hold on to a child if the plane makes a sudden dip because of an air pocket, and the child is now on the ceiling.|`|eulMjLtPaa	I'm not aware of any airline that allows "lap baby" status to an infant over two years old.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	No, the cut off is when they reach 2 years old. I have traveled with a 2 year old and there is no flight short enough where I would even consider letting them sit on my lap the whole time. It is very unsafe in case of emergency and they are too active to sit quietly and not bother other passengers. Buy a seat, bring toys and snacks and you and the other passengers will enjoy their flight,|`|YV0hGLh0aa	no because that wouldn't be safe|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Definitely not in the U.S. (not legal.) I can't say for sure about elsewhere, but I would not bet on it.|`|xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I fly a lot with my three children.     If you're in the U.S., the FAA is absolutely clear that once a child reaches his or her 2nd birthday, they must have their own seat (that question was on the final ;)    Some foreign airlines fudge with this. If the child turns two during the trip, they'll allow them to return on the parents' laps, for example with some airlines. If your child is already 2, then this wouldn't be an option.     I've heard, through coworkers, that in some developing countries, the airlines never check and school aged children sit on adults' laps. I'm not sure if I would be thrilled to fly an airline with safety standards this lax!     Children under age 2 are allowed on laps because of commercial reasons and because air travel is so safe, but this isn't in itself that safe. If anything does go wrong, these children have no protection. As a Flight Attendant, it bothered me, especially since the U.S. gov't employees always had a seat for each member of their family.     Once I stopped flying, I started paying for seats. My one big tip is to not get "caught up" in the issue of children's discounts. I found that often, when all the tickets were cheaper, we did better all paying the same (lower) fare. Children's discounts tended to be on more expensive tickets and were only a shade less than the adults'. Do the math before purchasing!    Bring her seat along, especially if you need it at your destination. Don't risk damaging and/or losing this important piece of safety equipment in the hold of the aircraft. Have it onboard with you for a safer and more comfortable journey for all of you!    For more information, I wrote an article on flying with children. It's based on both my personal and professional experience. I go more into detail on the whole car seat issue, as well as other topics related to flying. It's totally non-commercial and other parents have contributed;  http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com    An edited version appeared on the Expat Women website last month;  http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying...     Good luck finding a good deal and making that trip with her!

kH4Lb0ztaa	There are several possible answers to this question;  1) she may have been found but not identified, many mummies have been found in caches, made we think by priests when they realised that they could no longer protect the pharonic tombs, so they cached the remaing mummies and artifacts in a few hidden tombs. Some of which have been found, the most famous probably being that found by the Abdou El-Rasoul family. when a tomb containing many pharonic mummies was found high in the cliffs on the West bank, these mummies include ramses 2. It is possible Nefertitt's mummy is amongst one of these caches. Not all the mummies were identified and there are several female mummies.  2) Her mummy was destroyed by thoese who belived she had offended the gods of the day by her herasies, i.e. her insistance on one god.  3) her mummy has not yet been found.  There are other possible reasons she has been found but has been incorrectly ifdentified.It is highly likely that her mummy if originally buried in akhetaten was moved to thebes.  some of the queens of egypt mummy's have not been found and several Pharohs have not been found either.|`|ravzJTVOaa	her body is hidden from her enemies somewhere .  one day it will be found .  she was a great queen , cant keep being hidden for long .|`|YZpHkztAaa	Eventually Egyptian Pharaohs found that if they were buried with lots of gold with a nice big pyramid to show where said gold was buried, there were grave robbers. They then started to bury themselves in tombs. There are lots in the valley of the kings, and Tutankhamen is a good example.|`|AA11152480	may be it was stolen like many of the mummies, or hidden in somewhere to be protected from thieves
cdcc5bd1e7cd458a1cc4a95f146da288aa	probably not...there is not a lot of snow anywhere and it is warming up slightly this weekend.  but as a general rule of thumb, I always carry chains no matter what when I go to snow country.  If you don't have them the CHP can make you stop and turn back if it does get bad.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	There isn't much snow in Big Bear right now.  It's in the 50s and they got rain this week instead of snow.|`|MbdNt6vGaa	no, and there's no rain in the forecast! have fun :)|`|heFbG2FRaa	We went to Dodge Ridge on Sunday and the road signs said that we had to carry chains about 10 miles out, but we actually had to use them the last mile or so (after turning off the 108 Sonora Pass Hwy). When we left at about 4pm we saw three cars that had skidded off the road, one of which was a jacked-up 4WD truck with huge tires (but no chains) in the DR parking lot!
3ybiNfnFaa	Lakewood, 100%. it has that city feel but is a seperate city, which means you will pass 5 cop cars in a 1/2 mile stretch of Madison Ave (that's what you get when you have a huge rental city with 60,000 people in about 6 square miles). plenty of bars, restaurants, small shops, and things to do - and you're literally minutes from downtown. it's a very diverse neighborhood with a young feel, and there are gorgeous rentals that are reasonably priced. it's much better than living in Cleveland proper, and if anyone tells you it's too expensive they've never been to Rocky River (which is total suburban hell).  if you move there, look for places either to the north or to the west. when i moved to Pennsylvania from Lakewood a few years ago, the south and east were a bit shady.|`|DLxh9CANaa	You could try Shaker Heights on the east side- it's only a short distance from downtown, and even less so if you take the rapid, the way my brother in law does when he goes to work downtown. My sister and her family live in Shaker- and it's a WONDERFUL place to raise a family, with great neighborhoods and plenty of places to walk, even at night. I lived with my sister for a while, and I loved the town. It's got its own municipal government, police department, and school system- and the latter is first rate and is in no way connected to the Cleveland public schools, which are atrocious. Both my nephews attend the Shaker schools, and their father is a graduate of the high school there- he's native to Shaker and grew up in a house which is a few blocks from where he now lives.     If you lived in Shaker or one of its neighbors ( like Beechwood or University Heights, for example) then you could visit your fiance whenever you wanted to- it's just a short ride on the Rapid to Ohio City. Highland Heights is another possibility- it's close to Shaker ( it's between Shaker and Beechwood, in fact) and it also has Rapid lines running through it. Lakewood is okay on the west side, but it's a WORKING CLASS town, not a super rich neighborhood, as one of the other writers implied. I know- I lived THERE, too, for a while. Lakewood has more crime than Shaker or the communities on the east side, because it's closer to downtown and the poor parts of Cleveland. A couple of weeks before I left Ohio to move to the east coast, a woman was MURDERED at a house which was a block away from my apartment building. Her former fiance not only killed her, he tried to kidnap their 2 year old son that same afternoon- and this was in the middle of the day, on a hot afternoon in August. I know that when I was living in Lakewood, I never felt entirely safe, even when I was inside with the doors locked and the shades drawn. This happened about two years ago now, but I still remember it. I don't recommend Lakewood because of this, although I suppose there are parts of it that are all right.     Ohio City is not the world's best place to be if you want to raise a family. Kids need room to run and play, and there is not much of that down in that area. I'd check out the places on the east side first. Good luck.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Well I was told by a couple of people who live in that area, that Ohio City is pretty safe, and that there are mostly men in that area, but most of them are gay so its pretty woman safe. But that was like 5 years ago the neighborhood may have changed. Lakewood is pretty safe and not far from Ohio City.|`|1zYC6snlaa	I lived in Parma right by the Cleveland border, don't recommend it. Ohio City, I was recently told by a co-worker that it's nice, but it's not safe enough to let your kids play outside, or to be walking around at night.  I hear good things about Lakewood. Pretty richy neighborhood, so nice. But short distance from Downtown. I live 45 minutes away, and work in Downtown Cleveland, but you probably don't want that far away.  Maybe Brecksville? Brecksville is SUPER nice and safe. So is Independence. They are both probably 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes with traffic, from downtown. And Brecksville is a really nice school. Independence and Brecksville (and where I am from and other places, too!) share a Career Center (CVCC) and I went there. It is AMAZING! It helped me A LOT and was like going to college while still in high school. So that is a great place for kids.|`|H7p2nixQaa	Ohio City is not a place I would wak alone.    As far as raise a family it not the place by far.  If you still want to be close to Downtown, you mentioned train or bus, I would check out Lakewood.  Ten min. from Downtown.  Good Schools.  A lot of rentals too.  Rocky River is even nicer just little farther west. (Just not sure about the bus or train for this city)|`|TkVkNmB9aa	Ohio City is not bad, but i wouldn't recommend it though.  Downtown has really nice apartments and lofts, if you dont want to go that route, Tremont, which is about 5-7 minutes is close to downtown, reasonable prices, and is a really nice area, kid friendly, and safe.  Also have access to the highways or the option of taking the streets.
AA10601927	,,probably in the late 70's or early 80's , though it was still rough going in the early 90's  this is a question for "mohave dan" Waite for his response for accuracy...|`|c01eb38fba09582c78fbc7a2a19baeb0aa	Late '70's!!??!!

7PMpJqiiaa	There is a wonderful coral lagoon in a submerged volcanic crater with tropical fish called Hanauma Bay, about 30 minutes from Waikiki by city bus (called "The Bus") or 15 min by car if you are renting a car.  Besides tropical fish, I have also seen moray eels and sea turtles the last few times I've been there.  When you get to the beach, go to the LEFT where there is less beach but deeper water, you will be happier.  It is a national park, you will be required to view a video before going out into the water to understand how to protect the reef.  Get there VERY early to avoid cloudy water from the tourists kicking up the sand, and also if you drive, getting a parking space can be very difficult.  http://www.honolulu.gov/parks/facility/h...    There is a big snorkel/dive equipment rental operator in the islands called Snorkel Bob's, about $10-$20/week for fins/snorkel/mask depending on the quality you want.  They have a shop in different parts of all the islands.  http://www.snorkelbob.com/cgi-local/Soft...    It costs a little, but I strongly recommend you to rent a car, only $185/week including all fees right now, maybe even less.  This will allow you to stop on isolated beaches or that pretty jungle or water scene.  The quality of your trip will be immeasurably better.  Driving to the windward (jungle) side is itself a fantastic experience, and you can stop at Kailua or Lanikai Beach, both considered to be the most beautiful beaches on the island without a lot of people.    On the other side of the island is a spectacular Japanese temple if you have never been to Japan.  It is in an amazing location, under the Koolau mountains.  Called the Byodo-in Temple, there is also a lake with huge koi that your daughter can feed, and a huge bell you can ring for good luck.  (Don't be put off from the entry which is in back of a cemetary!)  http://gohawaii.about.com/od/oahusights/...    The kids all like going to the Nuuanu Pali Overlook.  It is historical as this is where King Kamehameha won his final battle, but more importantly it has one of the most spectacular panoramic views in all the islands.  But what the kids like is the WIND, which usually funnels through the valley to fierce velocity here.    If you want to watch professional surfers, winter is the time to see them practice on the North Shore (Sunset Beach, Banzai Pipeline, etc.).  Stop and have a burger at Kua'Aina Sandwich Shop in the funky surfing town of Haleiwa, and then get the traditional Hawaiian Shave Ice with 3 flavors at Matsumoto's or Aoki's (with vanilla ice cream or sweet beans) down the street.  Sit on the beach anywhere, but for people watching and sun-bathing go to Waimea Beach.    The humback whales should still be around Hawaii.  They have their babies while in Hawaii, are so cute. Bring binoculars and look for them right off the coast (sometimes VERY close to shore) near the Blowhole overlook, past Hanauma Bay.  Look for a large spray of water (looks like steam from a kettle) to locate them when they surface.  http://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/invo...    If you like to hike, Oahu has great jungle and vista trails:  *  Diamond Head - Diamond head is actually a round volcano crater with one side of the rim higher than the other.  You can drive to the inside of the crater and hike to the top of the rim for views of Waikiki and Honolulu beyond.  Because it is the tropics and the rim blocks the wind, can be VERY hot and dry so bring water and munchies.  There will be a lot of people, but to me, this borders on being a "moderate" hike and not merely "easy" but I am not in condition.    *  Manoa Falls - Right in the back of Honolulu in the deepest canyon is a beautiful hike to a 150Ft tropical waterfall with lagoon/pool.  All jungle trails are muddy and slippery so watch the kids!  Don't go in the water although you may see a lot of people in it.. you can be infected with leptospirosis, a parasite.  The web site below lists a lot of hikes, but this is really the most spectacular one..you go through bamboo forests, giant ferns, etc.  http://www.hawaiiweb.com/html/hiking/man...    On the jungle trails, I see a lot of broken flip-flops and abandoned shoes (how do people hike without shoes in the jungle..???).   So, either bring Tevas or buy durable rubber flip-flops and not the $10/pair kind from the drug store.  Also wear repellent!!    Honolulu's chinatown is like no other that you have seen, even including San Francisco or LA.  Make sure to go down Mauna Kea street where the ladies string the flower leis and amazing works of flower art..you can even buy a fresh dendrobium orchid lei for as little as $4.00.  Walk into the inside mall of Maunakea Marketplace and you will think you are in Singapore or Thailand.    The locals in Hawaii do not have a lot of money, only the tourists do.  Therefore, if you eat in tourist restaurants (except for a few exceptions) you will pay more.  Here are a few places you can try:  *  For a cheap breakfast in Waikiki, try Wailana Coffee Shop across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village ($5.75 for eggs, pancakes, bacon).   *  Duke's on Waikiki has great atmosphere on the beach for a good price, problem is everyone knows it so it is always packed.  *  The strong Asian influence has made an art of take-out food that you can buy and take to the beach.  You will see "okazu-ya" shops all over. I like the Island Manapua in the Manoa shoppi|`|3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	My best advice?  Try reading the local newspapers.  You can find plenty of activities, that are free, yet culturally enlightening.  When I was in Oahu? I read the newspaper, and found a local Japanese Culture Fair, that was free, and was totally entertaining.  In Hawaii, almost every hotel, has free music perfomences, in their lounge, and the Musicians, there are always top notch, people friendly, and have a very coy sense of humor.    When we visited Maui? The same thing. we went to the Maui County Fair, and were astonished at all of the things that go on agriculturally in Maui.  The visit to the sunken Ship Arizona, is free, and it is quite somber, but, historically important stop, for anyone visiting Oahu.  Try looking at the website of Oahu news papers, for ideas, and you can cettainly have a great time in Oahu, without breaking your bank.  Good luck to you, and may you and your daughter, have a great time in Hawaii.    Oh?  Almost forgot?  Each and every evening in Hawaii, make sure to go to the coast in front of allk the Hotels, and take part in the evening observation of the sunset.  Men will go from troch to torch, lighting the tiki torches, and when the sun sets, will blow the conch shells, as horns, to ackowledge the sunset.  Also in Waikiki? Is the International Market place, which often has free shows,  AND?  Sunrise at Diamondhead?  Free.|`|39V4qOAaaa	With a little research, you could find a great hike with beautiful views (around Diamond Head) that are FREE.

Some resorts give more than others and it depends on what resorts are pushing. You can always take the cash and put it towards the flex ticket.

When you get tired of the big city life in Bangkok you can head north to go trekking in the jungle...or head south to find some nice beaches. There are many places to choose from such as Phuket, Samui, Krabi, Phi Phi etc. But in general I think Thailand is great as they can offer great service, good hotels at affordable prices, excellent food, great weather etc. If you get a chance to go, don't hesitate :-)|`|euZRbiA2aa	My opinion its the most beautiful,friendly country i have been to.|`|d1MN9G31aa	Very warm and friendly.Nice food and lots of things to do and see.But seedy in the tourist places.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Come with an open mind and you'll find an exotic vacation place that you'll never forget and want to return to ASAP.

There are cracked sidewalks, and ultra luxurious hotels. Good highways and tiny, sois running behind Chinatown.  A strange mixture of shacks next to mansions.

Now, there's no guarantee you will get first class. That's a tough one to get free. But, even if you don't get upgraded, you can stop by the US Airways baggage counter before you depart and see if there are any bulkheads available. I do this often, and I get one sometimes. Good luck!

Dd14BZncaa	The short answer is no, unless you plan on taking a sightseeing bus tour of the two cities and not stepping off much.<br>  <br>  Montreal is a huge city with lots to see. Quebec City is a little smaller but has a whole lot more history to show. Since Quebec City is a three-hour drive away from Montreal, getting there and back just lopped six hours out of your schedule.|`|IUifxDUJaa	I would have to say no. Especially if there is a big group. I went on a class trip to Montreal and Quebec city and there were only 12 but we still had some issues with time and our trip was even 5 days. It depends on the age too. Like im in highschool so people often wanted to go off and see things that interested them instead of being forced to go to like a war museum or something. <br>  <br>  Overall I guess im saying go with the five days but try to avoid a monotonous, museam filled itenerary|`|qpqZybQ1aa	I would definitely go for the day 5-day itinerary as well. <br>  <br>  I would say about 3 days for Montreal and 2 days for Quebec City. You'd then be sure to see everything there is to see. And as someone else said, the 3-hour to drive to Quebec + getting to the hotel + getting everyone organized, etc. will take almost half a day out of your trip. One whole day in Quebec City is feasible if you just stay on the bus with a tour guide and you're not planning on giving any free time to your students. Bottomline is both cities have so much to offer and are very different, 5 days would be best.

uKWcgLLoaa	The Pike Place Market is fine for pure people energy and weirdness (!), but my choices would be things like the Space Needle, Experience Music Project and Pacific Science Center (all located at the Seattle Center--a 90 second ride on the Monorail from Westlake Mall in downtown Seattle). The view from the Needle is incredible and the other two have awesome displays of all sorts of music and science-related things.    I'd also make a ferry ride a high priority. From downtown to Winslow (on Bainbridge Island) only takes 30 minutes, and from downtown to Bremerton takes one hour. Walk-on fares are inexpensive, and you can either turn right around and come back (you have to exit the ferry and get back on) or else spend some time exploring on the other side of Puget Sound before you make your return trip.    If the weather is nice and you can figure out how to get to Green Lake (just a few miles north of downtown; buses go there, or it's about a 10-15 minute drive), there is an easy 3-mile walking/biking path around the Lake. Or go to the University District and walk through the University of Washington campus, as it is the most beautiful one in the entire country.    Th Woodland Park Zoo near Green Lake) is a very good one where animals are mostly allowed to roam in environments similar to those in nature. The Seattle Aquarium (downtown on the waterfront) is not so great but is decent and entertaining.     If you're into trendy shops, get yourself up to Broadway on Capital Hill and just stroll around until you find a shop or restaurant that appeals to you. It's just about a mile and a half above the Seattle Center.|`|EroXBvDNaa	there is the underground tour.

Me & my group were unjustly arrested and released only after paying a bribe of $200/person. The murder & kidnapping rates are ridiculous. I'd be very concerned if 2 of my female friends were going there. If you do go, try to stay in a nicer resort city & a nicer hotel.    An excerpt from the US State Departments website:  "While the largest increase in violence has occurred near the U.S. border, U.S. citizens traveling elsewhere in Mexico should also exercise caution in unfamiliar areas and be aware of their surroundings at all times.  Mexican and foreign bystanders have been injured or killed in some violent attacks, demonstrating the heightened risk in public places.  In recent years, dozens of U.S. citizens have been kidnapped across Mexico and many cases remain unresolved.  U.S. citizens who believe they are being targeted for kidnapping or other crimes should notify Mexican officials and the nearest American consulate or the Embassy as soon as possible.  U.S. citizens should make every attempt to travel on main roads during daylight hours, particularly the toll (cuota) roads, which are generally more secure.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to stay in well-known tourist destinations and tourist areas of the cities with more adequate security, and provide an itinerary to a friend or family member not traveling with them.  U.S. citizens should avoid traveling alone, and should carry a GSM-enabled cell phone that functions internationally.  Refrain from displaying expensive-looking jewelry, large amounts of money, or other valuable items."  Read through the whole page if you get a chance.  http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw...    There's quite a bit more to do in Vegas, imo. I've been to Mexico several times (Cancun, Mazatlan, Cozumel, Cabo, as well as many border cities). There's really only 2 things Mexico has on Vegas. 1) Warm ocean water. 2) Cheaper drinks. There are generally very few sites to see. It's mostly laying around the resort, going in the ocean, going in the pool, doing some shopping and drinking.|`|kIbZ7YzZaa	well given the current economic state it would be best to travel to vegas to help stimulate the american economy.      ive been to both several times, and lived in vegas for a stint.   you would have a great time whichever you choose.  1200 $ a person would get you some pretty classy accommodations in vegas, with money leftover to see some great shows. in Mexico it would be much more meager accommodations.    but if you do choose Mexico, Cancun is the place to go!  it is very safe,  there are tons of clubs, and tons of sights too see, there are several Mayan ruins nearby, lots of Eco-parks to visit, and tons of sun and relaxation.  don't let people scare you, Cancun is very tourist-minded, and Americans are treated like royalty when they are there.

But think of it from a mans perspective.  It is in our societies culture and history that the man be the bread winner and caretaker of the family.  If he fails, that is no easy burden to admit.    Budgeting is a crucial aspect to any marriage or relationship and takes much maturity.  Not only would I say that a bad family budget speed divorce, I would even go as far to say that it causes it in some cases.    Anyone can have budget problems even making over 1 million dollars a year.  The key is budgeting what you buy.  Pre-plan and lead a happier life.  If you are happy where you are, especially if in a marriage, then why would you want to leave.  Money is the rude of all evils and a necessary evil to survive.

It could go either way depending on who is more stable. things like having a good job, paying bills and other things like that on time, choosing needs over wants. so basically, the partner who is on track even through tough times is the partner who would most likely not suffer. oh and 1 more thing, its best if both partners know their surroundings and keep contacts because you never know when you might need someone.|`|KijGRGXuaa	not all the time , specially , if wisdom exist|`|xKcphGWIaa	I'm sure the wife suffocates more..

D?browa is a common name of towns and villages in Poland (just to mention D?browa Grnicza or D?browa Bia?ostocka) and the name also means an oak forest. While birch forests (the tree has got characteristic white bark) are often depicted in Polish paintings and often mentioned in poems.  As for beech trees, only the European Beech (aka Common Beech) grows in Poland in its natural environment while other species are grown for example for their ornamental features. The European Beech (Buk Zwyczajny) grows in the south of the country and in Pomerania (Pomorze).  As for other tree types ...

8Y7LQ6TGaa	Krakw is a great place to visit.     Costs are about 1/2 what they are in places like France and Spain on the Euro.    Most things are a short walk from the old market square, so stay near there if you can. As such, the old town it is full of old churches, gorgeous buildings, and a very large and vibrant town square lined with cafes. There are lots of classical music concerts. Visit St. Marys Cathedral and the other great churches in the old town. Walk up to Wawel hill and visit the Royal Cathedral and Palace. Take day trips to O?wi?cim (Auschwitz) and to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, and perhaps to the Eagle-nest Castles in the mountains. Visit the Museums.     The most striking thing I remember from Krakw is the Krakw Hourly Trumpet Signal    Every hour a golden trumpet shows above Krakw's central Grand Square in the west window just below the spire of the higher, municipal tower of the St. Mary's Basilica. Then a characteristic trumpet signal, known and dear to every Pole, played by a live trumpet player, resounds all over the city's Old Town historical district. All of a sudden the melody comes to an abrupt end. The Krakw signal, or Hejnal Mariacki, dates back to the Middle Ages when it announced the opening and the closing of the city gates. The bugler also played it to alarm his fellow citizens whenever he saw a fire or enemy forces. And the melody's abrupt ending is said to commemorate a bugler shot through his throat by a Tatar archer in 1241.    My advice would be to rent a condo near the market square, inside the Planty. I had one last June, it was great, just a stone's throw from St. Mary's. The market square has several dozen outdoor cafe's, and there are hundreds of restaurants/bars within a block or two.    Drink lots of Zywiec.    Warsaw is worth a few days, for all of the WWII monuments, memorials, and  memories, Getto museums and memories, plus the old town. It's a 4 hour train  from Krakw/    Get the Rick Steves DVD on Eastern Europe, which covers these cities, plus others.        Prague is great, you can easily spend a week there.    Prague has the market square, charles bridge, and the castle hill with  St Vitus Cathedral and the palace a short tram ride away, or a longish  walk.    If you get a condo in the right place, you can walk to the major attractions in each city.

reHRXlZCaa	I think it's a bit naive to turn around & say to someone that they should forget the past.  I don't think we should forget the past, the events of our past shape who & what we are.  It is possible to come to terms with the events that have happened without allowing them to scar us indefinitely but it takes time & energy.|`|AA11451795	They're right in that you shouldn't hate them (the British, not individuals) for it, but the Irish don't forget.  The problem is the British try to rewrite history, and some ppl believe it so therefore (I think) the majority of the English or British don't know the truth exactly of the more distant past.    You should remember, learn from, and build upon it.  Tell them that, but it's still part of who we are as it's so recent, whether we were there or not.  The way for us to live in peace lies with convincing ppl that there's nothing to hate or fear, meaning that you shouldn't hate or promote fear (not you personally).  I know that's understandably harder for some ppl than others, but we don't want to wind up in a vicious circle.    I feel strongly about the past too and I want unity but hate just pushes ppl away from it.|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	i know exactly how u feel..!  its SO ANNOYING isnt it you dont know what to say because you feel so strongly about it.im the same my bf is english,!!but i cant leave the past behind because it is still a problem today but i just learn to understand where he is coming from and dont really talk about it to him because if i did i would explode with rage lol.|`|62RKtkOhaa	It's easy for English people to say that. They don't happen to live with the reality day after day. I drive past the pub where the Trick or Treat Killings were, the pub that was blown up in Ballykelly with 13 killed. My uncle was blown up. My best friend was shot. I have no ill feelings against anyone - Catholic or protestant, unionist or republican or nationalist. But living with the memories of so much isn't about putting it back into the bag of history. That's too simple.|`|BNHeJm8Maa	Irish people need to get over the 600 years of oppression thing, its childish and immature for this generation to still hold a grudge.|`|AA10971249	as someone who has a passion for Irish history and  well academically qualified in it I would say this.    Do not forget your history as we must learn from it.

It's part of our shared heritage and we cannot forget the sacrifices our ancestors made. They died for us so we owe them respect and reverence.    English people have to learn too, all wars, not just world wars. Take the Black and Tans, for example. They were ex-soldiers sent to Ireland. They did what they were told but they were terrible things to do. Not saying that all Irish people were guilt-free either, Micheal Collins ordered the killing of 13 spies and that only led to Bloody Sunday. So it's your duty to remember our forefathers so that they didn't die in vain.|`|dAn9koABaa	its our history, and cant be forgotten , ask them to forget the last war, they want you to forget because it makes them feel bad|`|q9PVawNyaa	I'd say that your question is highly misleading.

First of all, you are not responsible for crimes committed by fellow countrymen in the past. The flip side of that is that you can now let go or any bad feeling that you have had regarding that bad time in the history of Northern Ireland - well, when I say 'can', I'm merely suggesting that it is allowed ....    I'm Irish, and I also think you should let it go, and not let your life be dictated by such a dark time in history, nor should you let it define you. If you hold onto it, you'll be that person who could not let go of the past. Do you really want to be that person?|`|bGuVAltxaa	Yes we should try and get on with our lives but it will impossible to forget the past, I have lived in Belfast all my life and have seen a lot of friends and one member of my family murdered. IMO we must get on with our lives because the other option would be terrible for everybody, I don't consider myself a bitter person and I have friends from both communities but I could never forgive the person/people who murdered my cousin. Time is a great healer they say.|`|sOi98doYaa	The english girls said right. Let the past be consigned to the history books.     No matter what has happened, peace has now taken over.. Lets build on it, and prosper..|`|gQEtEtLQaa	Your country's history is part of your heritage and it shouldn't be forgotten but nor should it affect your life today.  What's the point in continuing past generations' hatreds?  It doesn't achieve anything except bitterness.  I'm part Irish part English and I make a point of not discussing politics or religion because in the end it just causes arguments that I would never have become involved with otherwise. So if the girls in your year bring up the subject again, I would probably just say everyone's entitled to their own opinion and then talk about something else.

If you can live with a off brand one, then it will be less expensive to buy it in Thailand.       Granted I visit only MBK Centre in Siam Square area and there is a sports shop in the Fortune Mall on Ratchadapisek Road and Rama IX. There maybe sport shops in Central Lad Prao.  And you might see shops that carry back packs along Khao San Road.      Just make sure the back pack is well made.  Double stitching etc.    Good luck.|`|QPf6Z5eQaa	You really don't need a large back pack for Thailand. A small one will do...and since I can, I will disagree with a couple of answers here.    Buy your Backpack in Thailand....at least you have something to do! But of course everyone is different.    I used to come to Thailand with passport, visa, money and flight ticket only, well of course I was wearing proper clothing.    Forget Back Packing in Thailand. Sometimes I see Back Packers with these super huge Backpacks and believe me they are sweating.    They either haven't done their homework and read up on Thailand, ask questions like you, or they were travelling in a colder climate before they got here.

KS2OHXCRaa	16 and have a green card? This is very weird because my understanding is, green card is available only to someone within specific job categories and of particular salary scale (http://www.citizensinformation.ie/catego... ). Unless you're currently under a green card scheme as a dependant of your parents?    If so, the green card is technically not yours and you do not have the rights to work without the required dependant work permit (http://www.citizensinformation.ie/catego... ). Rather, it gives you a greater ease to access employment and exemption to application fees of the relevant work permit. (http://www.entemp.ie/publications/labour... )    In any case, you're not considered an Irish citizen unless your parents apply for Irish citizenship by naturalisation and you're put through the application as well, as their dependant. (http://www.citizensinformation.ie/catego... ) Or until you apply for the citizenship by naturalisation yourself when you reach the age of 18 years. Until then, you'll always just be a migrated person from another country.|`|dkkdt1FEaa	Are your parents citizens?? if you've lived in ireland since you were a child and your parents become citizens it is up to them to apply for citizenship on your behalf, because you are still their dependant child, in that case you will become a citizen by naturalization|`|m8Er68pSaa	Green card does not mean you are a citizen, just means you can work there.  You would have to go through the normal processes of becoming a citizen, just like if you had immigrated to the US.  Also, if you are American, remember the US doesn't recognize dual citizenship.|`|sOi98doYaa	To be an Irish citizen, you must have at least one parent, or one grandparent born in Ireland. Thats the deal buddy.|`|0xXW4Lozaa	Actually the U.S. DOES recognize duel citizenship. They just frown upon it.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	The US does recognize dual citizenship. There are lots of Americans with ties to France, Greece, Italy and Ireland amongst other countries. It is common. US citizenship does supersede it in their eyes though.    You should look into the rules for naturalization - you need to apply if you are not eligible through descent. Same as any other country really.

In July 2007, the Aurora Police Department and the FBI conducted "Operation First Degree Burn," a sweep that resulted in the successful arrest of 31 alleged gang members suspected of 22 murders dating back to the mid-1990s. Aurora has also adopted programs such as CeaseFire to reduce gang violence and prevent youths from joining gangs.

Jm3vMKx3aa	A Schengen visa is a certification in your passport that your desire to travel to a Schengen country for tourist/business purposes for up to 90 days in a 6 months period, for transit purposes for up to 5 days, or for Airport transit for citizens for certain countries has been pre-screened and the general requirements for entering the Schengen zone are met. It does not constitute an authorization to travel and enter a country; the final decision is made by the Immigration Police or Border Protection Officer.    There are also long term visa issued to visit an individual country for other purposes than tourist travel and business or hybrid visa or vanderElst visa.    At present 25 countries adhere to the procedures of the Schengen Agreement. Those are: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.    Holding a Schengen visa you may also visit the European micro-states Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City which are not officially party of the Schengen agreement but did not perform immigration controls before the agreement went into affect based on agreements with the locked-in countries. Although Andorra is not a member of the Schengen agreement it has abolished regular border controls; you must however hold a double (02) or multiple entry visa to transit trough Andorra.    Citizens of the following countries may travel visa-free for up to 90 days in a 6 months period: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Macao (SAR), Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, San Marino, Singapore, South Korea, USA, Uruguay, Vatican City, and Venezuela.

Maya Linda is not in the best area, but lived there for two years with no problems. The management keeps it very nice and clean and it's VERY reasonable. Rosewood is actually on the edge of Glendale, nice apartments but a little on the expensive side. Phoenix is a little tricky as some areas can go from good to bad depending on which street your on! I have lived here all my life.

MbtCFJbAaa	My daughter did it for one semester.  She described it as slave work for college students and "LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT"  her exact words.  She said she has never worked so hard but it was well worth it because you got a chance to see Disney in a way that no one else would.  You have to take a certain amount of classes, they provided her with an apartment and roommate (they take the money for it out of your paycheck).  You meet people from all over the world, her roommate was from Russia and she is still in touch with a lot of her friends, they meet once a year in Disney.  You have to work a certain amount of hours and take a certain amount of classes.  She didn't pay for the classes but the pay was not amazing either so it panned out.  She stayed for just one semester and was invited back, many stay on until they complete their degree.  One of the classes she took, was not accepted in her college but she didn't mind.  I think with her working there (she was Daisy Duck) she got attention on her resume.  People look at that experience as one to brag about.  She said that one person thought that was better than her 13 years in Girl Scouts and pledging in sorority.  It has great advantages as well.  If you have the opportunity, do it.  Try to choose 3 great areas sometimes you will have to work in the city below in the laundry but it is still an amazing experience.|`|413b409fd96101be076b46f8aee41bf0aa	The Disney College Program varies in length.  2009 Fall - approximately August through early January  2009 Fall Advantage - approximately May/June through early January  2009 Fall Advantage Quarter - approximately June through early January (only available to students attending schools on the Quarter/Trimester Academic Calendar)    Spring programs usually last between January and May; Spring Advantage between January and August; Spring Advantage Quarter between March and August.    The pay isn't spectacular - you're paid anywhere between $7.21 and $8.56/hr. and deduct living expenses so you don't have to worry about rent, utilities, etc.    College Program courses can be taken for college credit, but you'd need to discuss that with your career advisors since the school decides whether or not to award credit. If your school does indeed award credit for the courses, you might need to pay your school the appropriate tuition costs. The program itself doesn't charge tuition, but supplies can range between $15 - $120 per course. If your school doesn't award credit, you can apply for credit through other schools, although some fees will apply for those schools.    For opportunities afterward, look into Disney Professional Internships or look at full-time positions at either the parks, the corporate level, or Disney Cruise Line.    Edit: Wow, thumbs down for actually giving some reputable information from a reputable source. If anyone hasn't noticed, I indicated that I DO have experience in the program. Also, if you don't have an answer relevant to the question, you're better off not answering at all.|`|P4yJ0Cmvaa	Wow, it is so easy to go on the internet and look up the answer to give to him, can you just tell him from experience so that he will know for sure.

You can go to the Pools, but you probably cant swim in it, unless if your staying at the hotel.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	The realistic answer is...Alot more then you think. And right now hotels are really struggling to get capacity. This should continue though most of the year. They actually want people at their pools because they are likely to buy drinks, food and maybe gamble on their way out.    Techincally, nearly all require you to be a guest. However not all will check rooms keys upon entrance.    I know for a fact that the luxor never once checked my room key when I walked to the pool. Neither did the Monte Carlo, Orleans, or even Flamingo as i recall.    Dont even bother with Mandalay Bay. Getting into their pool is like bording an airplane. Mirage was also though, as was MGM from what I recall.

AA10766729	Welcome to our fair city!    It cracks me up that YA blanked out Dick's Last Resort!  LOL  It is a great restaurant though.  A nice high-end one in the same area is the Gaslamp Strip Club; some of the BEST food in the city, but be prepared to grill your own meat (but they have killer martinis!).  Best British pub, hands down, is Shakespeare's on India St.    There are a TON of things to do here, and a lot of them pretty darned cheap.  Check out Balboa Park's Free Tuesdays ( http://www.balboapark.org/calendar/detai... ), as well as the zoo, wild animal park, sea world, Birch aquarium.

OvJpK2Zsaa	if your occupation isn't on the skilled occupation list you are not eligible to immigrate to australia    if your from a participating country you may get a 12 month working holiday visa but you have to leave when your visa expires    http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	If your occupation isn't on the Skilled Occupations List (SOL), no amount of sponsorship of any kind will help. No SOL = no visa under any circumstances.  http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/1121... (the SOL)    If you're between 18 and 30 and from a country with working holiday arrangements with Australia, you could get a12 month  Working Holiday visa. If your occupation is on the SOL, you could look for employer sponsorship while you're here. Otherwise, you will have to have the sponsorship before you apply for your work visa. The bottom line though is still the SOL.    A possible alternative to employer sponsorship is to apply for state government sponsorship and then get a state sponsored visa - again before you arrive. That avenue is only available to people with specific SOL occupations as nominated by each state.
mAV5MJQnaa	Well I am not reckon on who that is, if he is someone famous that it would be cool to get an autograph, which you did. I don't know who he is though.
UQLNP6iyaa	For hotel, I suggest avoiding the brand name places and finding one of the really nice small B&B's. You'll save money and usually they are just beautiful. My wife and I always used to stay at the Nassau House on Fleming Street. Really easy walking distance to Duval, Mallory Square, shops and restaurants, but far enough off the beaten track to make it quiet when you need it to be. There are loads of these places down there, try googling "Key West Bed and Breakfast".    For entertainment you have to go see the Sunset Festival every night in Mallory Square. The street entertainers, food and drink are all a spectacle and the sunset is always nice to see. It's better on nights when there are no cruise ships as they can get in the way.    Take the Conch Train to get the layout of the island and the primo things to see. We always rent scooters to get around now we know the place and if you don't fancy that you can rent bikes, 3 wheel mini-cars or golf cart type vehicles. It's worthwhile to have some way of getting around during the day.    There are dozens of watersports places all over the island and you can do parasailing, sailing, powerboats, jet skis, fishing trips, either with lots of other people or by private charter (which we prefer), trips to the Dry Tortugas and pretty much any water related activity. We've done the jet ski safari a couple of times which is a guided tour of locations around Key West where you ride your own jet ski and follow a guide. I really like that.    There are a couple of interesting museums on the Island. Mel Fisher's Treasure museum is fascinating and, when it's open, the Little White House is cool too. There are great art galleries too as Key West attracts a lot of artists.    There are dozens and dozens of places to eat, but I recommend avoiding the tourist traps on Duval for dinner. The food is variable and they are all about turning tables fast and making the most cash. You'll do better to get off the beaten track for your evening meal, better food and better value. Our favorite place where we go every time is Michael's on Margaret Street just a couple of blocks from the Nassau House. Michael was one of the founding executive chefs at Morton's the Chicago Steakhouse chain. They do great beef, the world's best Chicken Cordon Bleu and some really really interesting fondue dishes. Everything on the menu we've tried has been astonishing. We prefer to sit at the outside bar which is in a really relaxing tropical courtyard. They've had the same bartender for over 11 years and he is a wealth of information about what to do and see on the island. He's also a world traveler during the offseason so just a really interesting guy to talk to. On the opposite side of Duval there are some really interesting island places to eat including Kelly's which is owned by Kelly McGillis. Terrific food. During the day you also must go to the little cuban cafe on the corner of Simonton and either United or South Street (sorry, can't remember which). It's basically a window next to a convenience store which serves the most incredible roast pork sandwiches anywhere. You sit on the proch of the convenience store and eat them while watching the world go by. Fantastic.    Go to Key West and Enjoy it. It's a great little place.|`|ACIp8lZqaa	Mikey thought this guy answered a Key west question rather well.  Juanitod that is...........    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|paerqxfMaa	It all depends on what you like to do.  We are famous for our drinking and partying.  We have various types of bars that have various types of entertainment music wise.  We have strip clubs, clothing optional bar.  We have great sunsets, watersports, family activities.  There are many nice bed and breakfasts around town.  We, of course, have Sloppy Joe's, Margaritaville, Hog's Breath Saloon - all the tourist spots.  We have shopping.  As a local, we enjoy eating at Caroline's on Duval Street, it's open air, you can sit and do some great people watching and their food is great (best jambalaya on the island) and they are reasonably priced.  We have art galleries - great live music - we pretty much have anything anybody wants to do - there is a great variety of things to do here.
eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	There are 3 ways to get there:  Taxi: There is a taxi rank at the airport, cost about 15 each way.    Bus: Get the Airport bus into city centre, cost 5 one way then get taxi to campus, cost 8 or get bus from city centre to campus.    Buses which pass the campus:    Bus No. 4 http://www.lothianbuses.com/r4.php  every 20 mins from St Andrew Square, Princes Street, Haymarket and Dalry get off outside campus on Colinton Road    Bus No.10 http://www.lothianbuses.com/r10.php  every 10 mins via Princes Street, Lothian Road, Tollcross and Polwarth get off outside campus on Colinton Road    Bus No. 23 http://www.lothianbuses.com/r23.php  every 20 mins via Trinity, Canonmills, Hanover Street, The Mound, Tollcross, Brunstfield, Morningside and Craighouse campus and then directly into Craiglockhart campus. Be careful - only every second 23 bus goes to Craiglockhart Campus - you need to get one with "Glenlockhart" on the front.    Bus No. 27 http://www.lothianbuses.com/r23.php  every 10 mins via Hanover Street, The Mound, Tollcross and Polwarth get off outside campus on Colinton Road    Bus No. 45 http://www.lothianbuses.com/r45.php   (Monday to Friday only; no service on Sat-Sun) every 30 mins via St Andrew Square, the Mound, Tollcross, Bruntsfield get off outside campus on Colinton Road    You can buy an all day ticket for the bus which allows you to get on any bus. Cost 3    You could use this ticket to get to the Campus from the Airport on the No: 35 bus which starts there.    Bus No. 35 http://www.lothianbuses.com/r35.php  Airport to Slateford Road (the stop after Chesser Asda, when the bus has turned into Slateford Road)  Cross Slateford Road to bus stop and get Bus No.44 http://www.lothianbuses.com/r44.php to the campus.|`|zgTsCicNaa	Take the Main A8 - Glasgow road into Edinburgh. At  Drumbrae Roundabout turn right into Meadowplace Road. Go to end of road then turn left into Lanark Road. At traffic signals turn right onto Chesser Avenue.

Turn left onto Craiglockhart Avenue.|`|jHVd9l1naa	Use this:    http://www.streetmap.co.uk/|`|tT6psCPSaa	I used to live down the road from the campus, so this is what I would do.    From the airport take the Blue number 100 airlink bus to the West End (3 single) about 30 mins peak traffic.    At the West End walk 5meters up the road in the same direction that the bus was going and you'll see the House of Fraisers department Store on Princes Street.    At house of Fraisers, turn right at the traffic lights and onto Lothain Road (you'll see a big red hotel on your left hand side the Caledonian).    From here you want to walk about 10 meters up the road and catch the number 10 or 27 Lothain Bus. If your unsure of what side of teh street to catch the bus from, the House of Fraisers Department and Princes street will be behind you.     The bus costs (1.30 single) and ask the driver to inform you of the  Craiglockhart campus (its should be about a 20 minute journey max).

Maybe Western influence shunned the practice and encouraged standard burial.

If you're talking about Singapore, Malaysia or countries in the southern part of Asia, then expect the winter months to be warm (warmer than summer-time in most US/Canadian cities).    So a winter coat from Asia would be perfect for fall in North America.|`|rcRoF7WNaa	I'm in the north near Beijing.  It was SO cold last week - it got down to 15 below zero (celsius).

mXCDJ9jYaa	I've always felt that was the real issue,as much as the TAP in Afghanistan and the oilfields in Iraq. The problem is people simply don't want to accept the idea that almost all wars are economically motivated. Splintering the P.A. as the izzies have done leaves British Gas will no other bargaining partner. But it's always like this. In movies wars are fought because of bad guys who have to be fought by good guys. Most people seriously prefer to look at it that way,and the media has to pander to that. Very few people are interested in the economics of war. When Obama goes into his massive buildup of U.S. troops in Afghanistan there will be little talk of natural gas; the media will tell people what they want to hear: it's all a crusade to save the world from terrorism. It's no different with the graduated destruction of the P.A. since 2000. No one is interested in the economic motives involved. They just want to hear about noble causes and crusades and bad guys in black hats and good guys in white. It's very easy to google up all the info you want on this subject - just put in natural gas/gaza as you suggest. Throw that on google and read the stuff. But no one wants to do that. They want a John Wayne western. It will be the same in Afghanistan.|`|AA10690306	Almost nothing.  Read your history.  Or if you find history too boring read "The Haj" and "The Exodus" by Leon Uris    And Zeno you need to read your history.  This has nothing to do with a relatively small natural gas find.  That is just a "red herring" being thrown up to try to hide the real motives of those who want the fight to go on and on, Hamas.    I worked in oil and gas and this supposedly major find worth "Billions" is nothing, a drop in the bucket and hardly worth developing.  You Hamas backers need to face the facts, Hamas won't be satisfied till either the Palestinians in Gaza are dead or Israel is destroyed and the Palestinians and Israel are wiped off the face of the earth.  Hamas is NOT a group that cares about the Palestinians.|`|AlbJmy7aaa	By my estimate, absolutely nothing.  They don't pose a threat to anyone so therefor do not factor into the need for someone to defend themselves from a hostile entity.|`|wVsjgj35aa	Yes; it's been kept out of the mainstream press but the articles available online refrence major new organs. It is not a coincidence that Sharon began his provocations immediately after BG signed the original deal with the P.A.     I don't think any of your other respondents know anything at all about the subject. Perhaps they should inform themselves before answering so they can look a little more intelligent.|`|74RNHyxHaa	I found this article, really interesting:  http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?c...  It's odd, how Israel tries to keep the real reason of it's wars a secret. Kind of like what America did in Iraq, except instead of "nuclear weapons", Israel blamed it on Hamas's rockets.|`|mE4SbWIuaa	I have to say that's about as good as anything else Israel has been falsely accused of.    But, in case you've forgotten, there was this little get-together at a place called Camp David in 2000 where Arafat was offered a great deal of concessions including but not limited to:     * Israeli redeployment from 95% of the West Bank and 100% of the Gaza Strip  * The creation of a Palestinian state in the areas of Israeli withdrawal  * The removal of isolated settlements and transfer of the land to Palestinian control  * Other Israeli land exchanged for West Bank settlements remaining under Israeli control  * Palestinian control over East Jerusalem, including most of the Old City  * "Religious Sovereignty" over the Temple Mount, replacing Israeli sovereignty in effect since 1967    All he had to do was to declare the "end of conflict" and agree that no further claims on Israel could be made in the future. So, the Palestinians could have had everything they claim they want.  But Arafat walked out on that meeting and launched his intafida and it's been fighting off and on ever since.     Even still, in case you've forgotten Israel had control of the Gaza Strip until 3 years ago. If they wanted that natural gas they could have taken it then, but they didn't. In fact, they pulled all their people and troops out.      So, all these claims of Israel trying to steal something else from them is just pure anti-Israel propaganda intended to cause more hate and stir up more violence.     Propagandists are as evil as suicide bombers, if not more so, because they inspire them.|`|8ZLPguF5aa	Golly gee whiz. You have a point here.  Israel must only be after natural gasohol!!!     I bet that is the reason they gave oil rich Sinai back to Egypt in the 80's. They just wanted to give away what you claim they now start wars over.    This has nothing to do with protecting their people from attempted murder.    Sure thing!|`|YilXDO4Zaa	Apparently Gaza is not as interested in the natural gas as it is in bombing Israel.  So, I don't think there is much connection.    If Gaza wanted to get into the natural gas business, which could be really be lucrative, it would have to have a stable government, stop the fighting between Fatah and Hamas, get organized.    But no, bombing Israel is more important.  So, Gaza has defaulted out of the natural gas business.

YM5yVvi1aa	It's not a stupid question at all. If somebody said they were from Carolina in the US we would wonder North or South.    If somebody is talking about Korea then they would generally mean that they are from the South or have been to the South.   The north and south parts are strictly divided and under completely different government rules. The north is closed and secretive while the south is progressive and open.  People visit South Korea a lot and many people from there go to other countries as exchange students or on visas to work or travel. People from North Korea don't have that opportunity. Also, individual visitors to North Korea are not allowed; people can only go as part of a really expensive and closely guarded and watched group trip. This isn't a common thing for a regular citizen to do.    Therefore, the people that visit Korea or say they are from Korea, are almost always talking about the South.|`|h6wBx8HPaa	that would be south...north koreans aren't allowed to leave the country,.|`|0894be71d36fb087dd4d64f6446344d8aa	south korea....   99.99% ppl mostly came from south korea  maybe .01% might came from north korea...

Actually there is no difference between the two koreas since they are the same people but if you want to know since this is a typical american question then you answer would be south korea.|`|pihAW3t4aa	they mostly mean South Korea|`|E5bDKyNyaa	If you're talking to some Korean-American in LA, probably South Korea. If you're talking to an emaciated man walking through the streets of Yanbian, China in the middle of the night, probably North Korea.    Very few North Koreans are allowed to travel outside the country, and it's relatively difficult to visit North Korea. So generally people who say "Korea" mean the southern half.    However, I once told a US border guard "Korea" when he asked where I'd traveled, and that included North Korea (Geumgangsan, before the tour was shut down). I just didn't feel like going into detail with him.    Both governments (North and South Korea) consider Korea to be one country that has been divided by ideological differences and war. They both wish to reunify.

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, take the downtown (southbound)  2 train (Red Line) to 125th Street. Once there, exit the subway and walk a block east along 125th Street (towards the East River) from Lenox to 5th Avenue.    Turn left at 5th Avenue and 125th Street and walk a half block north on 5th Avenue. The National Black Theater is on the east side of 5th Avenue.    I hope this information is very helpful.    Good luck   Native New Yorker|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	If you go to this link, it'll give you a map of how to get where you're going - http://www.timeout.com/newyork/venues/ea...

SbLeCOjZaa	I looked it up on njtransit.com because NJ trains go to Middletown, NY. It looks like you will have to take a train from Middletown to Secaucus Junction and switch there for a train to NY Penn. From New York Penn, you would have to take the subway to Brooklyn. Do you know where in Brooklyn you are going to?|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	I dont know if there is a train going through Middletown, New York. I do know that there is a bus going from Middletown to Port Authority in New York City. From the Port Authority Bus Terminal, ask a Police Officer which subway to take to Brooklyn. Make sure you have the complete address you are going to in Brooklyn, because there are a number of subway lines in the city.|`|jLTDqVHsaa	At the Middletown Station, you can buy a ticket to New York Penn Station.  There is no staffed ticket booth there, so you must use the machine.  Trains from that station will run on NJ Transit's Main/Bergen Line through New Jersey.  On the train, the conductor will ask for the ticket, punch the ticket, and give it back to you.    Get off at Secaucus Junction.  Find the trains to New York.  You will have to swipe your ticket at a machine in the station to access the New York trains.  They come every few minutes, so don't worry if you miss one.  If you need some help, ask an employee in the station.    Penn Station will be the first, only, and last stop on that train.  Very easy.  Get off there, and you should be able to start your subway journey to Brooklyn with one of the A/C/E/1/2/3 subways, depending on exactly where you're heading.  Buy a MetroCard at a MetroCard vending machine.  It's $2 per ride, so you'll probably need at least a $4 MetroCard.  You might need to transfer along the way depending on exactly where you're going, which is free; just follow the signs.

Once you find that out, you can continue your search from there. Unfortunately, I don't know where Middletown, NY is. I'm assuming it's upstate but I could be wrong. Check this site to see if there are any trains that arrive to Grand Central Terminal (midtown Manhattan) from there - http://www.grandcentralterminal.com/    Good luck!
bRLCxmP6aa	The weather depends, in part, on what part of the country you'll be in - if you're in the mountains, the weather will be different than it would be in Kathmandu or in the south. Generally, autumn is cool while winter is nice during the day and cold at night. Mornings can get a little foggy. The valleys and lower elevations are warmer and milder than the mountains.   It doesn't rain much outside the summer monsoon season - maybe a few days here and there, with occasional snow in the hills. If you're going to the mountains, expect occasional snow, especially at higher elevations, but because the mountains create a lot of localized weather, be prepared for a lot of variation.|`|TpQdg9jfaa	from your name i suppose you are a chinese ..... so nepal must be just moderately cold for you ..|`|yf0L2fAwaa	It depends on where you will be staying. Nepal is a very diverse place. And december will be a month of winter. The northern side which is mountainous, will be very very cold and gusty. The central belt, which includes many valleys including Kathmandu and Pokhara, the temperature will be moderate ranging from 5celsius to under 20celsius. The south belt which contains the Terai Plains, it will be very very cold with winter fog most of the morning and evening. So prepare where you intend to visit? Stay indoors during the morning and evening and probably wear just 2 layers (and no more) of warm clothes above your normal clothes.    Enjoy your visit to Nepal|`|Am92ln7kaa	simply i would tell u..  moderate cold winter in december!  so its cold in december  as u r chinese u will not feel that cold in deccember!    i m not that sure!|`|QBClN1dJaa	Nepals weather is generally predictable and pleasant. There are four climatic seasons: March to May (spring), June to August (summer), September to November (autumn) and December to February (winter). The monsoon is approximately from the end of June to the middle of September. About 80 per cent of the rain falls during that period, so the remainder of the year is dry. Spring and autumn are the most pleasant seasons; winter temperatures drop to freezing with a high level of snowfall in the mountains. Summer and late spring temperatures range from 28oC (83oF) in the hill regions to more than 40oC (104oF) in the Terai. In winter, average maximum and minimum temperatures in the Terai range from a brisk 7oC (45oF) to a mild 23oC (74oF). The central valleys experience a minimum temperature often falling bellow freezing point and a chilly 12oC (54oF) maximum. Much colder temperatures prevail at higher elevations. The Kathmandu Valley, at an altitude of 1310m (4297ft), has a mild climate, ranging from 19-27oC (67-81oF) in summer, and 2-20oC (36-68oF) in winter.    Required Clothing  Lightweight and tropical clothes with umbrella are advised for June to August. Between October and March, lightweight clothes are worn in Kathmandu, with a coat for evenings and warm clothing for the mountains.
aIyvWIJlaa	Cugador says you should stow away. You don't have to, because many cargo ships carry up to 12 legitimate passengers! Several agencies exist who will help you find a ship going to eastern US. Google "Cargo ship voyages" or try the site below.|`|AA11349530	just do a google search for transatlantic cruises ... mostly they're offering cruise/fly deals but if you only wanted one-way I'm sure you could do it|`|lQg2Ccbjaa	Well, you could try stowing away in a cargo ship container or something.    The only transatlantic passenger ship that still runs, that I've seen is the Queen Mary 2.  It goes from Southampton to New York, where you can take a train down to NC.    Check it out at http://www.cunard.com/    It's really expensive and will take a while.  Why is flying not an option?

rSq790ksaa	No, when you use your ticket to get into each park you have to slip the ticket into the turnstile and then they scan your finger using a biometric scanner. So if your husband used the ticket and then your mother used the ticket after he already had another day, it wouldn't go through.|`|54tW840Oaa	No I dont think so, Now they have this new technology where you have to put your finger in and it has your finger print u should just get him a ticket for less days and  another ticket for your mom|`|BhxycGViaa	how much do you want for it ?|`|k5iTTH2Iaa	I wouldn't be so quick to give it to someone.

If it doesn't match, you don't get through.|`|5AI4xIB3aa	If you are with them, they can probably change the name on it.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Yes others can use your pass on days you do not use it. I have never seen them check i.d.s .|`|eD7qRBKHaa	They use a biometric ID (you put your fingers on the ID scanner -it's not a fingerprint, but it looks like it).  So whoever uses the ticket first will have their biometrics attached to it.  No one else can then use that ticket.  This is the exact reason they do this - to prevent people from sharing tickets.  It is not allowed.|`|Gq0t3ERIaa	If the ticket has been activated already, then no. Disney doesn't have to check ID's, they check finger prints...  However, if the ticket has never been activated, then yes, but then only that person that used it may use the rest of the days...|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	not anymore, the first time you use the ticket you put your finger on the biometric reader and it records your fingerprint.  then everytime you go to use it again, it reads your fingerprint.

It's going to be hard to find any of the "Oceanfront Resorts" to allow anyone under 25 to check in. However, I did find a nice hotel thats only 5 minutes away from all the hustle and bustle of Myrtle Beach, as well as only 5-10 minutes away from the ocean. We stayed in the Comfort Suites at 710 Frontage Road in Myrtle Beach. It was a very nice room. King Size bed with 2 person Jacuzzi in room. Anyhow, their policies could have changed by now, but you should check them out as I know they did allow people under 25 to check in there.     Comfort Suites direct phone    1 843 448 4884
5f37c1ca843baed941347175d05ad20eaa	Usually May through August or September is pretty bad.  It might start washing up in late April too.  It washes up on currents every year.  It's not preventable, and it doesn't make the beaches "gross" as some people think it does.  Most of the beach parks clean it up.  But, the stretches of beach that aren't near a pavillion usually aren't cleared by the park board--at least in Galveston anyway.|`|AA10500250	sargasum breaks off and washes up in the winter months|`|LCun3uwTaa	they are not disgusting, i always use seaweed in my soup. they are very healthy. i've even tasted them on the beach. i didn't see too much last time i was there.|`|fe5a4af928ae62bdbc687f2290889024aa	We went in august and it was terrible
