DJLeObm4aa	Now Littlewi.... you have to remember I am in Scotland and you know we like to be different.  When I saw your question public wash-house meant something different to me. Yes! as others have recalled in the early 1950's I knew people could go to the local swimming baths and have an actual bath to cleanse themselves. However, public wash house to me was a place you washed your clothes and this too was in the local swimming baths. It was either called the Wash House or The Steamie and people would put their rather huge bundles of washing in what was called a go-chair or push chair or baby buggy as known now. When you went in to The Steamie you got what was called a stall to wash the clothes in and many a good conversation was held between various ladies in the different stalls. Have you never saw a Scottish play at Hogmanay called The Steamie? I thought it had been broadcast throughout UK but I may be wrong. You then progressed to the wringer and so it went on. Nearly everyone in Glasgow where I was brought up went to The Steamie every week to do their washing after the days of old wash houses in the back yard and it really was a social occassion for these women.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	Yes, the public wash houses were alive and well in the 50's where I grew up in Plymouth. They were attached to the swimming pool - this I might add was an amazing place, very glamorous ! The pool was on two levels, and had big fountains splashing water all over the place. For a kid from the little village of Hooe, across the Sound, it was like something out of a movie. <br>  The public washing facilitates were there too, you paid and got a towel and some soap, and the baths were very deep - you'd be submerged up to your shoulders. There were slatted wooden things to walk on afterwards, so the water would flow through onto the floor and would take the "athlete's foot germs" with it. <br>  I know that a lot of people had no bathrooms at home in those days (apparently we'd learned nothing from the Romans, 2000 years previously !). We did have a bathroom at home, but a lot of peple didn't. I remember my aunties coming to our place for a bath.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	I'm pretty sure the last wash house in Bolton closed in the 70's,maybe later. My local baths had a wash house attached. In the swimming baths itself,there was two pools,one for girls and a larger one for mixed bathing. The 'slipper 'baths was there of course.<br>  TERMINATOR.<br>  Maybe a UK thing.<br>  I think it was late 1800's they were established along with public swimming baths to help the hygiene issue of the poor|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	in the cellar quite a lot of people used them.<br>  happy days|`|O3nARYyMaa	Yes, I can remember using the public bath house, Cheltenham, in the early 60s.  I didn't know they existed before (they weren't anywhere near the local swimming baths) but we went there a few times until the house my parents had bought had a new bathroom fitted.<br>  <br>  I was 19 at the time and I felt extremely embarrassed.  Ho hum, thanks for the memory.|`|1OBXqGi8aa	Garden City, Kansas used to boast the world's largest outdoor free swimming pool. To enter you passed through the dressing room with lockers and then somewhat of a doorway with water spraying at you from each side from head to toe. It has been many years since I have been to any pool but I very well remember that from my childhood there.|`|EgXOeDP2aa	I think you know what my answer is  - Of course I do.<br>  The place was Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire.<br>  We kids had our weekly bath there.  Not in the facilities<br>  they cost money but in the swimming pool showers.  We<br>  took our big green block of Fairy soap with us and used it to wash our hair etc. when we got out of the pool.<br>  My childhood was very poverty stricken, but when I look back<br>  I had so much freedom and fun,  I think the kids of today have lost out big time. We didn't have toys but boy did we make our own entertainment.  We went hungry and we were cold but everyone<br>  else was in the same boat so it never occured to us to complain.<br>  I suppose that is the reason we are such tough old codgers and biddys<br>  now.|`|RYqybLq1aa	Yes, our local Swimming Baths were like that up till about 20 years ago when it became a Leisure Centre.

I have not been in a public swimming pool in many years. There were never any  showers provided for bathing.

VKXNWcbGaa	According to the Yousifali translation it says Quran 17:[104] And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, "Dwell securely in the land? (of promise)": but when the second of the warnings came to pass, We gathered you together in a mingled crowd.<br>  This means that The chilldron of Israel were  secure and had menny favors from Allah, untill they started killing the prophets. The second warning refers to the three warnings given to the chilldron of Israel (I think it was in the book of Isaiah). So, the first and second warnings came to pass, but the third warning was still to come.|`|mOWyzwubaa	17:104 We said after him to the Children of Israel: "Dwell in the land, then, when the time of the second promise comes, We will bring you all together as a mixed crowd.<br>  <br>  Compared to their small population, the Jewish influence is immense in its global platform, financially, politically and culturally. Disproportional to their population, Jews have exhibited astonishing examples in both good and bad, in both success and blunder, and they have enjoyed a vivid presence in world politics for millennia. This explains why the Quran mentions them so frequently both in negative (3:71; 4:46; 5:78-82; 5:60-65; 7:166) and positive terms (2:47,62; 3:33; 5:20). After being subjected to genocide and atrocious tortures by European fascist forces, Jews were scattered around the world as immigrants. Yet, they did not disappear from the global scene or take centuries to recover, as many other nations would do. A prophecy of the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 30:4-20 was fulfilled. Not surprisingly, with the help of the major powers of the time, they were able to establish their own independent state in 1948, soon after their almost utter annihilation; a state not in Germany, but in their historical land, which has once again become the focal point of a global conflict, stirring the world by showcasing human aggression, greed, hatred, cruelty, racism, and terror. As it seems, some are determined to use any means possible to get the promised lands of their ancestors (Genesis 12:1-3; Deuteronomy 1:6-8; 30:4-5; Joshua 1:1-5), while disregarding the warnings and conditions related to the promise (Joshua 1:6-7; Deuteronomy 16:18-20; 30:15-20; 31:16-17). A question regarding the promised land: since Arabs too are the children of Abraham, why aren't they considered to be the subject of this Biblical promise? If the Bible discriminated against the children of Ishmael, then what was their crime?|`|IxoBFCpTaa	It does not say land of "promise:"<br>  <br>  ((And We said to the Israelites after him: Dwell in the land: and when the promise of the next life shall come to pass, we will bring you both together in judgment.))<br>  <br>  It says "We said" in the past tense.

bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Good service is not outdated. Good service just cost more and is offered in fewer places. The changes that take place in the market place are both interesting and often frustrating. Don't order a hamburger at McDonald'ss.  At McDonald's you must order a Big Mac.  At Whopper Burger you must order a Whopper Burger if you expect to get a hamburger there. In order to get fried potatoes anywhere you must speak their language.  Your language is antiquated and therefore if you are going to spend your money in a business you must adapt and speak their lingo. Welcome to the world of today that commercial business has arranged for you to live in.  My own contribution to this world of today is my version of the gratuity.  They don't like the changes that I have made and I don't like the changes that they have made.   We are even now.  If they like it that way, I can live with it. I also still have the choice of where to spend my money.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I agree that the young people of today do not know good food and the names of food we used to eat all the time.

t7hFh8STaa	If you are not friends, there is nothing to worry about.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I'm 47 amd my opinion probably doesn't count since I'm probably a dinosaur for you LOL  However, some things never change and it did happen to me.  I was sixteen, my friends had a party and for some reasons didn't invite me.  It was a lot of people, not only my friends so there might be someone who didn't like me and my friends went thinking I wouldn't know.  As it always happens, I found out .  The ocean is almost in my backyard, just a little trail away from where I live(I inherited the house when my parents died so I'm still living at the same place).  I had a special place where I used to go when I needed to be alone.  It was under a tree on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean.  When I arrived at the end of the trail, which was still a few feet from that tree, I saw my neighbour, a man who must have been no more than 40 if that.  He was looking at the ocean and was so far away in his thoughts, he didn't see me.  My self pity stopped at that exact point because I remembered that he had been diagnosed with cancer that week and he had four young children.  It goes to show that our problems seem very little when you see something like that.  He did live until he was in his 60's but it wasn't an easy life.  All that to say that you have to take all that in perspective.  As for the party, there will always be another one and the next time it will be somebody else who will be forgotten.  Enjoy the next party!|`|LBVme6Ucaa	If you let this girl know that it bothers you ...then she won.So just act like no big deal and she will do a slow burn.People like that are not worth your time.Rise above it.You are cool and she most likely knows it.|`|d7ec3591d989416ca5206c4fa4afbaa3aa	personally no...i have never had that happen to me..but i do have a few friends where the exact thing has been  happened to them....<br>  <br>  they were extremely upset..but the only reason they got over it was cause they told themselves...well if they weren't invited..the party wouldn't be a fun without them and too bad for them...<br>  <br>  just think of it like that...|`|VgayqgcNaa	Yes,this is the reason to be sad.it sometimes happens and u should forget it and her

tYqUutidaa	Halloween has origins in the ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain (Irish pronunciation: [?s?aun?]; from the Old Irish samain, apparently derived from Gaulish samonios).[5] The festival of Samhain is a celebration of the end of the harvest season in Gaelic culture, and is sometimes[6] regarded as the "Celtic New Year".[7] Traditionally, the festival was a time used by the ancient Celtic pagans to take stock of supplies and slaughter livestock for winter stores. The ancient Celts believed that on October 31, now known as Halloween, the boundary between the living and the deceased dissolved, and the dead become dangerous for the living by causing problems such as sickness or damaged crops. The festivals would frequently involve bonfires, into which the bones of slaughtered livestock were thrown. Costumes and masks were also worn at the festivals in an attempt to copy the evil spirits or placate them.[8][9]|`|hl4kkvXhaa	It was first celebrated in festival form by the Celts over 2000 years ago, though I don't think anyone has ever agreed on an exact date.  I just double checked my facts...I knew it was Celtic, but wanted to be sure I remembered correctly.<br>  <br>  It was basically a harvest festival (Samhain) and people would dress up to scare away evil spirits and they would dance around huge bonfires that had been built by the druids, burning crops as sacrifices.  I also believe that I read somewhere that the tradition of carving jack-o-lanterns started in this time as a way of scaring evil spirits that may have been lurking around their homes, but I am not entirely sure.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-ha010400a&article_id=114&chapter_id=2&chapter_title=Birthdays_&_Holidays&article_title=Halloween" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-...</a><br>  <br>  It's a site for kids, but still very informative, so you might find something new.  :)|`|uji29VvRaa	All Hallows Eve, according to many experts, is said to have first been observed by the druids as far back as 700 bc.

For an acurate history lesson from my past.  /  Reared in small town of Georgia I heard N-word in 3 different pronunciations.<br>  ***** = A person w/ dark skin<br>  Nigra = A ***** that you spoke of affectionately (b/c you didn't have to bother w/ correct pronunciation & could speak in your southern drawl).<br>  <br>  On an Oprah show, there had been a debate that "******," by Webster definition, meant a "lazy person."  Oprah conceded this but rolled her eyes & said, "But can you say seriously, that when you hear this word, the image of a black person does not come to mind?"<br>  <br>  I mention that b/c as a young girl hearing this word w/ disdain, I asked my Grandmother what it meant.  She said that it is a very bad word.  It means someone of "no account."  And eveyone has something inside them that they can count to the glory of God's gifts.  So when someone has "no account" it just means that they are wasting the talent that God gave them to glorify Him.  /  I asked her if she can show me what one looked like.  She said they were hard to find b/c most everyone will have some gift they share. / So we keep walking & go into a Mercantile & Feed store.  She nudged me & whispered, "If you want to see a real ******, there's one."  And she pointed to a 20-ish white male laying on a stack of hay.  She told me that his father works so hard to provide for his family.  "That boy's grown enough to help his daddy out but he just lays there all day waiting for the store to close to get money from his daddy to spend on his moonshine.'<br>  <br>  So that was my 1st impression of the N-word.  That's the mental image I see when I hear the word. <br>  <br>  For you to change your vocabulary, it might help to think as I did, that it's very serious to call someone of "no account" b/c only God knows their heart.  So in essence you are judging a person's worth on this earth without knowing their inner heart.  And you would not want to be judged by the worst moment of your life & labeled a derogatory name b/c of that for your whole life.<br>  <br>  So when tempted, think that you are calling yourself into judgement.  Then STOP yourself & say, "I choose not to be someone else's judge b/c I don't want to be judged."<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.  If not, find your own mental image or emotion that works for you.<br>  <br>  And by all means, apologize to the family telling them that you learned something wrong & you are trying to reframe things to make it right.|`|ZW0JHvdraa	You're certainly not setting a very good example for your kids!

dc410a18f3925f018ef295987b0b2fcdaa	This shows that Jesus can't be God. He's jus only a human and a phrophet.. Human has weaknesses and desires and is not perfect..|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Well, wasn't that the devil's problem in the first place....he wanted to be higher than God?<br>  <br>  And Jesus never did deny being the Son of God.<br>  <br>  God the Father was never tempted, nor was the Holy Spirit.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	That's a great question... and Christ did not make the claims that his followers make. He even called his apostles his "brothers."<br>  <br>  And another interesting aspect of that section of the gospel story is that the devil was the first in the Gospels to quote scripture!<br>  <br>  Now, does that make it the word of God or the Word of the Devil?|`|VRl1jENHaa	Nina is correct.  You must look at it this way:  we are told that Yeshua is the "second Adam."  Whereas the FIRST Adam rebelled against God, the second Adam did not.  Whereas the FIRST Adam brought sin and death into the world, the second Adam brought the means for these to be taken away.  Whereas the FIRST Adam walked with God until he sinned, the second Adam walked with God continuously and always did His will.<br>  <br>  Also, remember that Yeshua was born with a HUMAN body; that means that He inherited the rebellious nature of Adam and Eve -- YET He refused to give in to it.<br>  <br>  In summary, this was God showing humanity that, with God ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Odds are, Satan was blinded by the very same pride that he originally employed to swindle Adam & Eve. <br>  <br>  Satan is not omniscient, and a thorough reading of the scriptures shows that while some demons might have recognized Jesus as God, Satan never did.<br>  <br>  In fact, if Satan had ever figured out that Jesus was indeed the only begotten Son of God, Satan would never have permitted the Jews and the Romans to put Jesus to death.|`|AA11707311	The devil was trying to get Jesus to go along with HIS plan, and not God's plan.<br>  The kingdoms may have been the devil's to give, he was in posesssion of them, but the plan of God to reclaim us was more important to Christ.<br>  Christ had to die and defeat death and sin to reclaim them.|`|oVHFz52Laa	No. Jesus was fully God and fully human while on earth. Human Jesus was tempted by Satan but Satan does not have any power over Him.<br>  <br>  Now Jesus is in His full glory, meaning at the right hand of God. He is on His throne, exalted<br>  <br>  Read John 1:1 to 14 from the good Bible translation. The Word is God and the Word became flesh. Both Jesus and Jehovah are called the Alpha and the Omega, how many Alphas and Omegas yu believe in?|`|ubsq8O8Baa	in Job god says the earthly kingdom is given to the satan - he has all the power on it except in taking life.<br>  this is quite interesting incidence to show that jesus was fully human born who was tempted by satan to eat food when he was fasting and asking him to worship him so that he can come out of the agony of undergoing Crucifixion|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	Was Satan Really Offering the Creator things he had in essence Created?<br>  No Satan was appealing to the physical body jesus lived in.<br>  <br>  Hunger and greed and to put the body in a unsafe test of abuse.|`|GlCrG0wPaa	Jesus has Divine nature but that doesn't mean that he is the God.<br>  <br>  In the Catholic doctrine, we believe that there are THREE persons in ONE God- Father, Son and Holy Spirit. They are ONE in their DIVINITY.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Jesus in human form, stripped His Shakina Glory and became a humble servant, with total dependancy on The Father for our example!|`|5NSfFGqxaa	Jesus said to the Devil you shall not temp the Lord thy God. The devil was tempting Jesus so why did Jesus say God? because He is God|`|HbCWNCQzaa	yes....because Jesus was a human he had human logic......meaning he could be tempted|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Yes, essentially.Pride got him in trouble in the first place!|`|1fyZTtnVaa	You are missing the all important 10th verse here.<br>  <br>  Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.' "<br>  <br>  This verse clearly shows that Jesus was not even remotely considering accepting Satan's promise.<br>  <br>  And to say that He was tempted does not mean that He considered doing these things, which you seem to imply in your question.<br>  <br>  Merriam-Webster defines it as-<br>  <br>  To entice to do wrong by promise of pleasure or gain.<br>  <br>  This shows that the the word tempted is applying to the actions of Satan in the verse, not to the actions of Jesus.|`|jrCzR8NFaa	Jesus can answer hey I made all of this things around even you how come you offer this things to me when I actually own this...I remember last time we Study the Bible with a Baptist. She  viewing a Movie about Jesus together with her niece in their church. When the time Jesus about to die and called at his Father... She ask her Aunt "Aunt Whom Jesus called, another Jesus...  Even A 3 year old Girl ask that confusing question... Whom actually jesus called? The answer is his father Jehovah God...
AA11232725	The Bible refers to the sky where birds fly as one of the "heavens", outer space where the sun, moon, and stars are as one of the "heavens" and the spiritual realm where God resides as Heaven.<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:14  Then God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:20  Then God said, "Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens."<br>  <br>  Lamentations 3:41  Let us lift our hearts and hands To God in heaven.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 6:1  In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple.  2  Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  3  And one cried to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory!"<br>  <br>  Revelation 4:1  After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this."  <br>  <br>  2  Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne.  3  And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.  <br>  <br>  4  Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads.  5  And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.  <br>  <br>  6  Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.  7  The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.  8  The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" <br>  <br>   9  Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,  10  the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:  11  "You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created."|`|VRl1jENHaa	The Scriptures speak of three "heavens":<br>  <br>  1)  the place where God resides;<br>  2)  outer space; and<br>  3)  the earth's atmosphere.<br>  <br>  So when God created the heavenS and the earth, He created all three at once.  This tells us that, prior to the creation story, God simply existed within Himself -- and did not reside in a specific place.|`|2P5WRadhaa	It literally means, "God CREATED everything. Imagine God, who has always existed, even when there was "nothing" Imagine Him speaking to that vast nothing, and it obeyed Him  and became something . the universe, everything; stars, planets moons asteroids, earth galaxies. on & on & on. He simply said, "Let there be..." and there was...! Wow! It's beyond my scope of logical understanding. But God's ways are so much above our ways, and His Infinite ability so far above our limited, finite minds, that I cant question it, I simply accept it by faith. That way I have no trouble wasting my time by trying to analyze it.|`|Ii0Kd6hdaa	It means that the people who lived during the time of the writing of the bible didn't have the foggiest idea of how the world worked so they made up a fairytale to explain what they did not know.|`|F32uPjAraa	It means that aliens terraformed this planet, watch all fourteen videos.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiZc9ernK28&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiZc9ernK...</a>|`|ae42c685a1c84f56bdffcb7bf2dc5965aa	KJV <br>  "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Gen 1:1<br>  <br>  "Thus the heavenS and the earth were finished, and all the host....." Gen 2:1<br>  <br>  The word heavens is with the Hebrew particle eth, which is always plural in the Hebrew, just the language.|`|2MtDp74raa	Heavens: probably referring to all the solar systems, etc. that make up the universe.<br>  <br>  God didn't create Heaven and Hell same time he created Earth and the Solar system.<br>  <br>  God is Heaven [with God, as you described it]. Got has been and always will be. Therefore Heaven with God has been and always will be.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thats my thoughts.|`|qQUuVhFBaa	im lutheran and was always taught "the heavens" means the universe and everything beyond|`|DDwecKakaa	only heaven knows what the hell Genesis meant.|`|sohnrZDcaa	In the primitive culture of the Bible writers there were up to seven Heavens!|`|qXFACB58aa	My perception is kind of like Joel H|`|bzsnAC7Iaa	My Bible is singular heaven.|`|izXIAxXGaa	When I was in classes with my Rabbi, he turned out all the lights and said can you tell me how many students are in the room. And then we read something similar to this from the Torah. If you cannot see it, it does not meant that it isn't there. Men of science forget that they are limited to the scope of their measurements. Beyond that, theories without scientific proof are, in fact, a religion in itself. <br>  Atheists say that Christians, Jews, and others are always bothering people to convert to their religions and always advocate their religion of a belief that God does not exist. They preach this in the classrooms to kids. They preach this on TV and in the movies. And it is as asinine as clearing a drug to be used by consumers without being passed through tests by the FDA. <br>  We accept that we believe that there is a God but do not have the tools to prove that beyond a belief.<br>  Scientists insist that everyone accepts a false truth that there is no God and refuse to accept that is merely an untested belief in and of itself.<br>  The heavens could be in the next galaxy or they could be right about you in another dimension. Because we can not see them does not mean that they are not there.<br>  The rabbi that taught me passed away about five years ago. He said before he died that when you turn the lights out, he is still there even though you cannot see him.<br>  Shalom.|`|doLepY4daa	You shouldn't have stopped at Genesis, you should have kept reading and you would have learned about the "first" heaven, the "second" heaven, and the "third" heaven, each clearly defined by the bible itself. Your conclusion is non-biblical nonsense.|`|QtoDx4Vtaa	The most I ever thought about it was that God created the Heavens as in... think of it as like an ocean. Some people call it the "high seas" (plural). But there's only one enormous body of water. You certainly have an interesting take on the Scripture. I would ask a priest just to be sure.|`|tg7K9mPOaa	That's a pretty good answer right there, the Heaven and Hell one. But I think the heavens include the skies. All the clouds. Because I heard somewhere that sometimes you can see angels in the clouds... or maybe i was just told that 'cause whoever thought so. I'm not entirely sure on the angel part.|`|L8VW3P2caa	It's obvious that the authors of the bible were not scientifically correct thus that is why the bible is a work of fiction.|`|Vw1REpBKaa	Genesis is a work of science-fiction. Heaven and Hell are both fictional worlds much like Middle Earth or Tattooine and don't exist in reality.|`|c7f69b1a6447dc385e4a6eef027db5e6aa	I am Christian.  I believe it means that he made everything.  Let's not try to over analize.  It is what it is.|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	There is one Heaven and one hell.  Where did you get that there was two?  Spirits and human souls?  That means the same thing.  Hell perfect?  Where?  Plural Heavens?  Not in any Bible I have read.  And, we have a lot of different Bibles!<br>  <br>  Well, first of all according to my beliefes there is ONE HEAVEN and ONE HELL. I do not follow a specific religion. I have a relationship with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. I go to a Born Again Christian Church and I read the Word of God. That is my "religion". <br>  <br>  The only "perfect" place for souls (I don't believe in spirits other than the Holy Spirit or human souls.) when you die is Heaven with God. Hell is eternal punishment with the Devil. God created both, I'm assuming He created Hell, but I wouldn't call Hell a second heaven. There is only ONE HEAVEN.  God created the universe.  I <br>  my Bible does call the "heavens" the universe.  That is what that means.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|vUiUoamVaa	write me and i will try to explain this
38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	The problem with Revelation is that no one knows John's intent. There are several schools of thought on that: 1) the events are to take place in the future 2) the events already took place, making the Roman state religion the Whore of Babylon, and 3) the events were purely symbolic and intended to strengthen the persecuted Church of the time.<br>  <br>  Irregardless of which position is correct, the Catholic Church is not and cannot be the Whore of Babylon. Catholicism is staunchly Christian, and those of us who belong to that Faith love our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ very much. We believe that the only means of salvation is through the Precious Blood of Jesus shed on the Cross as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. And finally, we worship God and Him Alone.<br>  <br>  Anyone who tries to tell you anything else is either not telling the truth for their own purposes (our resident "false gospel of works" cut-and-paste artist comes to mind) or simply doesn't know what we really believe. We Catholics are now and always will be Christians.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, if you didn't see the comment I added to the Best Answer question, I'll take this opportunity to say that I'm sorry. Your previous questions led me to the conclusion that I came to, and since you said that I'm wrong, I'll apologize.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Christ promised us that the gates of hell would never overcome us. He never made that promise to the schizmatic protestant sects and cults. If there is to be a harlot or harlots, it is pretty safe to believe that those responsible for damage to the body of Christ, the heirs to the reformation will be the ones. Pax Christi|`|NWnOTkwCaa	That teaching was wrong.|`|AA10034051	That is a lie. Jesus Christ's Catholic Church is not the harlot|`|AA11403192	God has a time plan for everything and the minute that still has to come to allow for the hour to allow for the years to fulfill are knock knock knocking at you front door. We are entering into the space that is set fourth in scriptures that is called the begging of sorrows and the 10 years of tribulation that all this world will go through as judgment is set an all those that are holy will be holy still and all those filthy will be filthy still. So you see that if you had read for yourself the word of God you would have understanding of this.<br>  And if you would read the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act you would see that they have set things up to kill mankind as those that they choose in the name of humanity and the final say is none other than they all answer to they all bow down to none other than the God of this earth and they will worship him as a god or die because he believes himself to be higher than God and the whole world wonders after him the Pope. Read it for yourself. Protect your self in Christ.<br>  Study the final Jubilee and you will see that we are in the 70th and last 50 year jubilee and then all things written will be fulfilled.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	There's lots of better candidates for "harlotry" in this world ... and the protestant denominations are certainly not excluded ... since being unfaithful to the only Church that Jesus ever personally founded (the Catholic Church) isn't much different than being unfaithful to Christ himself.<br>  <br>  And there's your harlotry!|`|5shqstYraa	No one knows the hour or the day that the Messiah will return.<br>  <br>  Matthew 25:13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.<br>  That would be Yehowshuwa the Messiah|`|VRl1jENHaa	Read the Book of Revelation.

Check Revelation.|`|doLepY4daa	The Roman Catholic Church is "a" harlot, and only a small part of "the" harlot.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	The great throng of saints and great heroes of Christian living in, through and for the Catholic Church ,founded by Jesus, that the Holy Spirit produced in the One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church from the beginning of the Apostles' ministry is great evidence that we are not the Harlot of Revelation, thank you very much<br>  <br>  God bless<br>  Come.Lord Jesus!|`|HOQp0gA7aa	Because the minority of Christians (the Protestants) are not beyond using a smear campaign against the majority of Christians (the Catholics).

AA12048147	Nice cover up there with the little one liner about atheists also being closed minded..... And yes, it goes both ways... We are closed minded by your prospective of life and you are closed minded by our faith in God..... This is a never ending circle of argument that will not end until the time comes for it to.... and you can take that however ya want..... I can not and dare not speak for any one else but myself.... I KNOW for a FACT , there is NO doubt to ME that God  *IS*.... there is nothing in a science or history or any other book that will change that..... there are NO words that can be said by you or anyone else that will change that FACT for ME !!!! I accept the possibility that God did things HIS way, however that way may be... Evolution or not.... I am one that does not worry about that...... Why worry about something that can not be changed... makes NOT a difference to our lives today.... has no bearing on the out come of humanity ..... and so it goes...... go in peace..... God bless|`|7dad943aeb0eea9ef53ff4446976257baa	Why can you not see that we have considered the ideas you have put forward and rejected them? Just because you have difficulty accepting that because it can be difficult doesn't make it untrue. I personally am not bogged down by your disbelief so have a very open mind to reality. However I would love to know what the non religious subjects that I have made disappear into my "Blind faith" are.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	your definition of close minded is wrong<br>  <br>  close minded means you think you have to believe in every thing and every religion and if you do not you are close minded.<br>  <br>  <br>  denying other religions is not being closed minded.<br>  <br>  God declared what the truth is and that salvation comes through him only and no other.<br>  <br>  My beliefs are what keeps me open minded to know that what God says is true, and what goes against what God says is wrong. To say other wise is to deny the truth and be close minded and ignore god's word.|`|2MtDp74raa	yes. one has to realize that they cannot take the Bible literally.<br>  <br>  <br>  I believe that God created the world, but thet evolution took place. I think He molded the Earth and its creatures through means we can sort-of understand (such as evolution). I do not think humans have been on earth since the beginning. I do not think everything just came into existance when some giant said "Let there be light".<br>  <br>  God wants us to explore all possibilities so that we may or may not see the light and truth in Catholicism.|`|zkrVc020aa	All things are open for discussion, but if you have no convictions, you have no identity, no purpose, no ambition, no ..anything. It is better to have a conviction, be wrong and change than to to be so open minded as to be nothing but dull.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	If you are 100% sure about your beliefs in God, you are deluding yourself.  Plain and simple.<br>  <br>  There is no way to be sure about God.<br>  <br>  So, yes, if you close your mind to the most eternally open question, you are blinding your own sight.|`|0puMsQJgaa	Good Question...!<br>  <br>  I use BLIND FAITH... when I turn on my Computers [2] and when I connect to Yahoo... and when I post here...!<br>  <br>  How about YOU?<br>  <br>  Here are some sites for those that have Problems with Creation!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.icr.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icr.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fishdontwalk.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishdontwalk.com/</a><br>  <br>  Thanks for Asking!

Or what about the fact that there is no god. can I believe there is a god and there is no god. I think it is commendable that you are thinking about the subject but this post doesn't make a lot of sense to me|`|vUiUoamVaa	no and yes|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Not at all.  Believing in God does not deter me in the least from seeking truth.  I would never reject science if it conflicted with religion.  I think they are simply 2 separate entities that travel on parallel paths.  Scientific acheivement, while great, is not the be all -end all of life simply because many things are beyond it's scope, and many things are beyond it's measurement since they cannot be clearly defined|`|6ypnDnvLaa	Someone "close minded" (unreceptive to new ideas or information) would seem very intolerant of other ideas, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  What if someone told you: "1+ 1 = 10"?  <br>  It would not be closed minded to say: "That's wrong." or "I disagree"<br>  But, if you say: "You are a moron" <br>  that would questioning that person's reasoning all together.  <br>  He might have a very good reason for saying :"1+1=10" :( <br>  Sometimes, it may be beyond you to find his "rationale".  <br>  But eventually might figure out: "He's thinking in Binary!"|`|8cuPVvYnaa	Narrow-minded is a better word than close minded for Christians. But there is a reason why we are "narrow-minded." We believe that every person is born with a deadly "disease" (or sin nature). Because of this "disease" we are all going to die. But our Creator loved us enough that he sent a "remedy" (Jesus to die for our sins, taking the punishment for us). Now do you understand why we are "narrow-minded"? If we believe that God provided ONE remedy for our world's problem, would we not hold firmly to our belief in that "remedy"?|`|ORFXYTj6aa	Hi buddy,Im as opened minded as anyone and agree anythings possible.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	In the 15th century everybody thought the world was round. How could it be otherwise? they said.Up until the 19th century everybody thought it was impossible to talk to someone on the other side of the city much less the world. Up until the early 20th century everyone was sure that our galaxy was the whole universe. Up until the late 20th century everyone was sure the atom  or at least neutrons and protons were the smallest possible particle.<br>  Blind faith in science can be misguided too.<br>  Your faith in God has to come from within you where intellect and logic don't enter into the equation.It is a part of you unfettered by space , time or place. Once you have an awakening of your spirituality there is no further need of proof. It's as if the blind could suddenly see what was there all the time.<br>  You can liken it to Sir Issac Newton, Galileo, Einstein, Hippocrates, Archimedes. After their contributions you could never see something the same way again.<br>  Each one's path is different. I found my path and have accepted that there is a God, but it's religions that get in the way of peoples belief.

g4lLX3iaaa	The Queen only confers knighthoods (apart from the Order of the Night of the Garter) on the recommendation from the government in power.Gordon Brown has told the Queen that he wants this adulterer and coward to be given an honorary knighthood.Gordon Brown has an exceptionally convenient memory.He forgets his role in the the economic crisis that the country is in today.He forgets  that it was his decision to sell off our gold reserves when the price was at it's lowest ever price,today,it is I believe at it's highest price ever.He forgets that it was the IRA that murdered Lord Louis Mountbatten and that the IRA was/is funded by NORAID and didn't the adulterer Ted Kennedy have something to do with that organization?You bet the lying S.O.B did.I remember watching a documentary on T.V about the New York police going around the bars in N.Y city collecting money for the IRA but as soon as the 9/11 incident happened,they cried foul and outlawed terrorist organizations.It is just a terrible shame that the Queen cannot refuse to give Kennedy the honour but,it would be nice if,when she dubbed him that the sword would slip a little and sever the jugular.<br>  <br>  Edit........To the person above,everything that you have said,is what Kennedy did for america,it has NOTHING to do with Britain.If he is such an hourable man,let the americans give him the congressional medal of honour.We in Britain have nothing to honour him for.A very minor offence?The young woman that he left there to die may not have thought it was so very minor or do you think that Mary Jo kopeckny (spelling?) was someone that the all powerful Kennedy clan could dismiss as easily as they did?|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Senator Edward Kennedy is someone who has supported the Republican cause in Northern Ireland for decades. He is not a friend of Britain. Far from it, he is someone who helped Noraid raise funds for the IRA, the same terrorist organisation that murdered Lord Mountbatten, the beloved great uncle of the Prince of Wales. Quite what the Royal Family are thinking now is probably unprintable. No doubt some of the money Kennedy helped to raise was used to blow up the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984, leaving many dead, crippling Norman Tebbit's wife and almost killing Margaret Thatcher.<br>  <br>  How on earth Gordon Brown can think Kennedy is suitable for a honorary knighthood is beyond the comprehension of many.|`|addec7857a715f2e28715837812ec5fbaa	such an Knighting contaminates the Kennedys and is impertinent to consider that any royal bauble enhances anybody|`|30R7gIXtaa	I am sure she does, why would it be relevant. a very minor offense of leaving the scene of an accident in a long and distinguished life. he was only given a suspended sentence<br>  <br>  you may think he deserved more , that is irrelevant as he wasn't charged or sentenced with more, so he is an innocent man of anything else<br>  <br>  In April 2006, Kennedy was selected by Time as one of "America's 10 Best Senators"; the magazine noted that he had "amassed a titanic record of legislation affecting the lives of virtually every man, woman and child in the country" and that "by the late 1990s, the liberal icon had become such a prodigious cross-aisle dealer that Republican leaders began pressuring party colleagues not to sponsor bills with him".<br>  <br>  additionally you do know that list is submitted by the PM it isn her idea<br>  <br>  <br>  but during the dark days of republican misrule he brought the battle to the forces of evil|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	The Senator is far from a perfect man,but even inperfect beings are capable of performing great service to their country.Senator Kennedy deserves the honor for his tireless work on behalf of the working people,the poor people,the people who have no voice in politics.|`|c8lBbWtQaa	Not bloody likely!!

A a matter of fact, I can make no sense of a LOT of commercials I skip over with my thumb on the fast scan button on my VCR. I rarely watch ANY TV in real time. I elect to watch from tape so I can watch a full hour of prime time TV in as little as 40 minutes of MY time. The ones which bother me most are the car commercials with a barely under control car skidding to a stop with a "professional driver on a closed course". WHAT exactly is this commercial telling me? If any car is so hard to control WHY would I consider buying it? WHY they consider that a spinning, skidding car is a selling point is BEYOND my comprehension. Commercials in a lot of cases make NO logical sense to me. Then again, some actually DO make sense. Taco Bell has a beef and cheese burrito for under a buck. As far as nutrition goes, meat, beans, rice and cheese covers the majority of food groups in a healthier manner than most other fast foods.|`|YJpFJvcwaa	its the money you could have saved if you switched to geico.... lol duh

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Ever feel like your chasing your tail? Many people ask me how I can be so organized. This is what I do. I work full time, I do interior decorating consulting, I make and sell soy candles, I write when time permits, and in all this I have a fiance, three daughters (between us),five grandchildren and two cats. If I can do it, you can too! <br>  <br>  One thing I do is make lists. Every day I write down what needs done and I check it off. Including if I have to go to the store. Let's say Sunday I know I have a busy week ahead, I will list everything for the week, and I check it off when completed. This has two rewards to it, One is you don't usually forget anything and two is the sense of accomplishment! <br>  <br>  Save time! When you are doing errands, set the day for that, Do a circle and try not to back track. This saves on gas and time. Groceries, gas, lottery, bills etc. Some p[eople say they don't need lists, they have a great memory, (the same people that is that tell me I am organized.) Lists keep things in order and help you have more free time to do what you like to do, not so much what you have to do. Try it, and you'll see what I mean. <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	There are many self-help books which you can avail yourself of to help organize yourself and end your "scatterbrained-ness."  They can be found in your local library, on the internet (search, please!) and in bookstores.<br>  <br>  There is also a great website which can help you become more organize, where you can start...

Builds character!<br>  <br>  You don't mention HOW these kids are annoying... what do they DO that annoys you?  Is there some way of dealing with that behavior? You have babysat for these kids before, and they ANNOY you?  How do you deal with their behavior while you babysit for them?<br>  <br>  You know, when (and IF) you ever become a parent, YOU are going to have to learn HOW to deal with ANNOYING kids... of your OWN!

BevylvVSaa	The only real working from home jobs involve you finding a place that hires people and allows them to work primarily from home. There is a place where most people go into an office to work - and you may have to periodically go into the office for some things, but mostly you work from home. I have two such jobs - one is working for an arts organization where I am in charge of communications, ordering office supplies, and setting up conferences and workshops. The other is working as ADA coordinator for a city where I answer questions regarding ADA compliance for the city employees and the community, write grants, manage ADA projects, and support the volunteer disability commission.<br>  <br>  My lover lives in Boston, but works in Silicon Valley. He commutes there for a few days each month - most months - but almost entirely works from home.<br>  <br>  So look for jobs you would be good at - assess whether they could be done from home, and then apply for them. As an ADA accommodation you can ask to work from home if you can complete the work equally from home as in an office.<br>  <br>  Outside of that - there is going into business for yourself, which others have described.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Thinking you are disabled and actually being disabled are two different things.

But then, nor is being Italian.  When you see any characteristic turning up frequently in a particular group, it usually indicates simply that that group has intermarried over many generations, concentrating particular genes.  My Jewish father had very curly hair (and I WISH I'd inherited it!) and I know a few other Jews who have the same densely thick curls.  I haven't seen it among Italians, but then I probably just don't know a big enough sample.  But it really is as simple as marrying within the group over generations.|`|9b3537c30933da7786dc8b95599adf7daa	small amounts of east and north african dna.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Genetics?|`|LRezhwfVaa	Jews and Italians tend to have more darker features, hair, skin, etc...<br>  The darker and coarser the hair the more prone for it to naturally curl.

4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	Depends.<br>  <br>  I believe in pretty much everything... faeries, vampires and werewolves included. Does that mean I believe in all the myths and legends about them? No. I think there's something to it, but I think it's all been greatly distorted and exaggerated throughout history.<br>  <br>  There's also the possibility that such things do exist, just not /here/. There are other dimensions and worlds out there, supposedly, so maybe it's just something that humanity intuited from elsewhere. Could be possible.<br>  <br>  Though personally... I identify with the vampire concept myself. However, I think it's just a person who has a messed up energy system and relies on an outside energy source to be healthy. Nothing really mystical about that, is there? Most people will agree there are people they feel 'drained' around, so is it a stretch to think that some people might be able to consciously control such an ability for whatever reason?<br>  <br>  As for the other two... I do believe in them, as I said above. I'm just skeptical about what people have made them out to be. Butterfly-winged balls of cuteness and people who turn into huge, blood-thirsty wolves? No. Elemental spirits and people who can mentally shift their consciousness to that of a non-human animal? Sure.<br>  <br>  But that's my own opinion.|`|Ot8huEkGaa	Yep cause im five and have nothing better to do than believe in something that is obviously not true.|`|dFBccLExaa	I believe in vampires- but not the form that the media portrays (there is an illness/disease that can cause similar behaviorisms to that of a vamp). <br>  I don't know about werewolves. Probably on the non-physical planes. <br>  Fae- oh yes. I work with the regularly. I think they are like spirits and deities, and that they reside on a different plane than we do. To me, they appear as little balls of light- usually purple.|`|CSysSbnlaa	You just listed 2 out of the 3 creatures I am. I'm a Vamp Witch Fairy. How's that? Oh, answer my question.

DvZdB66maa	No, I would never be a Playmate. I have the body to be one, but I would rather not show my nude body to a world full of strangers. That is for my husband's eyes only.

I think my dad would be extremely upset with me, and would feel uncomfortable talking to me anymore.|`|S4zNEAFJaa	No. I'm not "ample" enough and I really don't want to get surgery.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	Yes, they are different to "avoir"<br>  The French perfect tense formed with "être" requires the second part of the verb to match the subject in gender and number. Therefore if the subject is feminine the past participle will end with "e".<br>  Marie est arrivée.<br>  Elle est partie en ville.<br>  <br>  If the subect is plural  then an "s" is necessary at the end.<br>  Pierre et Henri sont montés dans le train.<br>  Marie et Josée sont descendues.<br>  <br>  It is the gender/number of the subject (person or pronoun) that regulates the ending of the verb, not the other way round.|`|JO8FKDRhaa	its true. but let me fix your english grammar: <br>  <br>  In the present perfect tense ( passé composé ), être verbs are different from avoir verbs as être verbs  indicate whether the subject is masculine, feminine and singular or plural.

Maybe if you're in the 4th grade trapped in 1992 but otherwise "kool" shouldn't be in your vocabulary. <br>  <br>  I think if you're both open to it watch them whenever, however you shouldn't force your partner to do anything they aren't comfortable with, period.

However, if you really want to go to Europe, French is spoken in more places.  On the other hand, unless you really, really want to learn the language, it really wouldn't matter.|`|JO8FKDRhaa	spanish and french are very similar. spanish is easier to learn, but french is not really all that much harder. still i recommend that you do what i did. i learned spanish starting in middle school then picked up french when i was in 10th grade. it was easier to leran french after having a foundation in spanish. theyre both useful for europe... france and spain afterall.|`|0LtkfhIgaa	spanish is easy and doesn't take much time to learn? if that's true, tell me why most american don't speak spanish even though 30 millions or so spanish speakers live in the U.S. and even though most americans at one time of their lives have taken a spanish class?<br>  spanish an easy language to learn? give me a break.|`|ufTjv25Jaa	French !<br>  <br>  I'm taking French and it's great!

It's 'Comment ca va?'  not 'Como Sava"<br>  <br>  hahaa.|`|YGz6ojgraa	Whoever told you spanish was easy their a lie! Spanish is hard  work and I beat french is too. I speak fluent spanish and write in spanish and it toke me 4 years and Im still in spanish in college so that I don't forget anything. But you have to decide if your going to europe then french and if not then spanish oh and if you plan to speak spanish just think,  about half of americans ( ok so a little less than half) speak spanish. But whatever the choice you have to decide. I hope I helped!|`|PTWnWkPRaa	spanish is not an easy language. I have taken both spanish and french. I took french when i was in 7th and 8th grade and then switched to spanish because i thought it would be easier. After 8th grade i went to europe and spain. I would suggest you to take french, its a beautiful language. Although a lot of people know spanish. If you aren't going to get a job someday that has to do with a language take french. Its suppppppppper fun<br>  Good luck!!!!|`|4mNlz3a6aa	Both languages are cool. But there are more jobs requiring spanish than french. I took french in high school but my first language was spanish and english my second. Whatever language you take in high school you never forget it.|`|XiiPmHELaa	I don't know how hard French is but I'm in Spanish three right now and Spanish is very, very easy to pick up on. So I say Spanish.|`|nK4j9s7paa	French, it's beautiful|`|atcEtDQSaa	definitely french....it's way more exotic :)|`|p2HHFTufaa	Its a fairly easy language, but I don't really know Spanish. But if you intend to go to Europe you should take French.|`|mdV0oXATaa	french, its the language of love|`|rcEq136naa	If you're up for a challenge, take French. But, if you have trouble learning other languages quickly, I'd take Spanish. I think that French has completely different words for feminines and masculens, but I know that Spanish only changes the last few letters. Good luck!|`|nAmUOnkLaa	Spanish is definitely easier to take and faster to learn, but it's also a lot more common than french. You're more likely to use spanish in your life and in business than french!|`|2VtDIQrvaa	spanish is very easy to learn but it will be more useful if you take french, since you plan on going to europe. i'm taking french now and it isn't that hard either.|`|YLda7wVHaa	to speak spanish ir really easy! so learn it! if you learn spanish, learning french will be even easier, because they're similar<br>  buena suerte!|`|eoIzzw6oaa	colleges like french better but you can find more use in the united states with spanish.|`|82MZX0MLaa	ok well i am Hispanic n i guess it betta 2 take Spanish it easy  well when you being it wont be but on by one u will get it *gud luck* :)|`|AaPyuC5faa	FRENCH FRENCH FRENCH!!!

M1u6fdZCaa	You shouldn't be interested in a specific race...it should be a specific guy.|`|SEzMrFrbaa	sure.im white(u see it in my avatar)and i find black girls sexy|`|cIPziIdnaa	It seems to me with bi-racial couples, it is much more common for the man to be black with a white girlfriend, than the other way around.  I think most.many/some ? white guys are intimidated by black girls or black culture even and therefore do not pursue those kind of relationships - but I could be totally wrong.  If you are attracted to white guys, I'm sure there will be one out there for you.  Good luck!!|`|phcw1KhGaa	yeah white guys are in to black girls and white guys are in to shy girls, but you won't find a guy of any color if you can't come outta your shell a little bit... it's easier than you think.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Yes, there are many black women who are very attractive and sexy in my view.|`|AA12380098	I love them You can be my African Queen any day!!!!|`|Jip9xEkBaa	yeah! some of my white guy friends are always saying how they want to bang rihanna and beyonce haha.

Technical skill has nothing to do with the genre though. <br>  <br>  I don't like any of the choices. I'm more of an electronic/jazz/ambient type.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	The genre has nothing to do with the musician,its the musicians themselves..|`|YOt6uTSzaa	Orchestras....|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Classic Rock.|`|Yi24ELaQaa	Oh wow. I listen to all those, and what most people think of when they hear them in word association is"CRAP!". The crap they think it is is only the corporate **** with no talent, who got famous.<br>  Hmm, rap and hiphop (REAL rap and hip hop) takes some skill and rhythm, and there are some gems in rappers out there who can control their voice with sick patterns on command, and others with speed to boot. If you count in freestyle where rhyymes are out of the top of their head, and the dj has to know wtf he's doing at all times(not to mention keep track of audience reaction.)<br>  <br>  Pop, like say Mariah Carey, Kelly Clarson, etc, takes singing talent, but little else. Most pop is dominated by corporate trash, with singers that suck but have millions due to people buying their crap. The music behind it does not take much creativity or musicianship, unless you count in techno as pop.<br>  <br>  Heavy metal. I love metal, and even from the most simple earliest forms of metal on, the musicians need to keep all the instruments in sync, keeping up with tempos and time signuatures. All musicians in metal have to have talent: the bassist, the guitarist, the vocalist and the drummer. <br>  <br>  Metal definatley takes the most musicianship to play and create, especially if you consider live sessions of most heavy metal artists. (and yes jazz dude, the most technically skilled bassists, guitarists and drummers are jazz trained.)|`|xelkbdbdaa	Though I can't bear listening to it, I would say country. It actually challenges the singer/songwriter to provide a harmonious collaboration using live instruments, a melodic range and a very distinct lack of electronica.<br>  <br>  I prefer electronica.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	Rap: Push a button and talk.<br>  Country: Play 4 chords ad nauseum and whine.<br>  Pop: Rip off last year's hit and make the words dirtier.<br>  <br>  SOME metal requires great speed and technicality. So, of the four, reluctantly, metal wins.|`|tYqUutidaa	One who composes, conducts, or performs music, especially instrumental music <br>  heavy metal then  rap|`|zkrVc020aa	The "style" does not determine the difficulty. The nature of the composition does.|`|hlnNZ9N4aa	Metal seems to have better musicians who play at incredible speeds.|`|AA10504443	I have found them equally challenging.|`|vnQiDxOaaa	Definitely Heavy Metal. Stuff like Dream Theater, Black  Sabbath, Megadeth, Slayer, Celtic Frost.
4sh2oRR7aa	Yes, whites are 80%.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	well if you count the all the minorities as one, then no, white would not be the majority. but if you count everyone separately then yes white is majority.|`|DgsHQ47yaa	Yes, but barley. When are no longer the majority things in America will get bad. That is if Obama doesn't destroy us within 4 years.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	In the United States overall maybe, but in California, probably not. Just my view.|`|p4u4i1JVaa	Yep white people will probally always be the majority.|`|fusc1cykaa	Not for long.|`|BSt7ji9Xaa	ya to be honest it IS hard to believe especially in some places like where I live that we are still considered the "majority" where I live the majority of people here are indians and hispanics.. then blacks then whites.. but odly enough according to the "statistics" we are still the majority where I live even though visibly i dont see it. I personaly dont care though Im fine with being a minority or whatever u call it, its just a number anways.. Id be pretty erked out if i lived in an all white town with no other cultures.. that would be so boring lol.. no offense.. i mean i love my culture but mann i find other cultures far more intresting to be honest..|`|nTvPLJ8Baa	Yes.

VzCygD6taa	Yes I’ve thought about it often – <br>  The Apostle Paul was addressing the Athenians at the time of his visit to Athens and the same thoughts may be addressed to Christian and many other people in this day and age.  <br>  <br>  Paul had found a dedication that read to the Unknown God.  Like the Athenians this is the position, those that do not understand God love and care for his creation, find themselves in today.  <br>  This includes those that venerate man made images and pray to saints appointed by mankind..<br>  <br>  Acts 17:23-31 NIV  <br>  23  For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.  <br>  24  "The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.  <br>  25  And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.  <br>  26  From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.  <br>  27  God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.  <br>  28  "For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.'  <br>  29  "Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by man's design and skill.  <br>  30  In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.  <br>  31  For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead."|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	In the past God overlooked some of their actions because they were ignorant to some of what God had not told them.<br>  <br>  At this present time he commands all men every where to repent.<br>  <br>  Because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world by his righteousness by a man who he has ordained, to present moral conviction to all, caused to stand up him from death or the dead.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the one who will judge and was raised from the dead.|`|VRl1jENHaa	Yes, I've thought about these verses many times.  I believe they go hand-in-hand with the many verses that tell us a person must HEAR the Gospel in order to no longer be considered "ignorant."|`|zcJ0I0ovaa	romans 1.20 and on.<br>  now there's no excuse|`|OhYE3GhKaa	(Acts 14:16) 16?In the past generations he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways.?.?.<br>  <br>  *** Bible Citations ***<br>  <br>  (Acts 17:30) True, God has overlooked the times of such ignorance, yet now he is telling mankind that they should all everywhere repent.<br>  <br>  (Luke 24:47) 47?and on the basis of his name repentance for forgiveness of sins would be preached in all the nations.?.?.|`|bzsnAC7Iaa	Go back and start at verse 23.

But sometimes, the truth is best kept unsaid. We never know how someone reacts to a certain truth, which isn't always the best thing. People who ask for the truth, need to know that it could be something they didn't want to hear and that it can hurt them in turn for wanting to know.|`|XRFlcSX3aa	if you can anticipate their reaction or know somehow that they're just not at all going to be cool with what you have to say... then maybe you should keep that feeling in until you think it's mutual. <br>  <br>  otherwise you're kind of being selfish a little by risking whatever current relationship you have with this person. just one perspective. the hopeless romantic would say never waste time when it comes to revealing your feelings or intentions... by the time you get around to it... might be too late (i've had this happen to me and there's nothing worse).<br>  <br>  gotta use your own judgement and put yourself in the other person's booties..|`|ssV4NDUVaa	The truth should always be revealed, because the moment you did that...

AEZ75dJ7aa	I think it's a fantastic idea.  I am a very strong Christian and adore Jesus.  I credit part of that to learning about other denominations and other believes.  I teach my daughter about other religions and other beliefs because I think that will protect her from being manipulated by doctrines.  It has made her a strong Christian because she's not afraid to research and find the truth and we know the truth ALWAYS leads to Jesus.<br>  <br>  Edit: Wow I read the other answers and am kinda surprised.  How can a person witness to others if they don't know how to approach them "where they are"?  How do you show someone the truth if you don't know how to show them the error of their belief?  I show my daughter why I believe what I believe and can show her in scripture where other "religions" differ.  I know that she is protected from "cults" and dangerous manipulative religions like Mormanism and Islam because she has researched and compared their belief systems.  She's also protected from doctrine that is misguided and distorted because of this.

HimBbU6caa	Any person with sense would know that Egypt has been known to have diverse ethnic representations throughout history. Cleopatra was a descendant of General Ptolemy. One of the four Greek generals who inherited Alexander the Great's Empire, so she was not a black woman as some people have been taught. There were also Nubian rulers and a Nubian Pharaoh in Egypt at one time.<br>  <br>  Black people don't have to go far from Egypt to find great civilizations that rivaled those of Egypt. Just a little further down south. However, Egypt had the advantage of not being landlocked, so they were always dealing with other civilizations outside of Africa: Phonecians, Greeks, and later the Romans. This gave them a huge advantage. Even when they were vassals to greater nations.|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	The people who created the egyptian kingdom or any of its bases were proto-egyptians (closely related to proto-berber and proto-semites people) who settled in the Nil valley , the proto-semites created babylone , assyria , phoenicia , jerusalem while proto-berbers created numidia,andalusia , and carthage (carthage was a mix berbers/phoenicians) and nowadays all these peoples are together in the Arab world!|`|6JcodrClaa	I think your analysis is accurate...And the information you collected seems to be quite reliable...<br>  <br>  I don't understand why a lot of people in the US, for the sake of "afrocentrism", are arguing that the Ancient Egyptians were Black...<br>  Even if some Pharaos of South Egypt were Black, that was only a short time in the whole Ancient Egypt Era and that doesn't give the right to some people to claim that they are "the descendants of the Kings and the Pyramids Civilization"...|`|AA11059890	well i like to go with what i know and since it's not often you'd see someone my shade creepin' around the desert thousands of years ago, i would think it's safe to say white folks are outta that little debate, i'll let black folks and the brown folks hammer that puppy out|`|R3TzcZu8aa	You did a very good job compiling all that info.

Africans where enslaved. the world could and would not believe the great Egyptians came from the ones who are enslaving. <br>  <br>  Just like almost every country today, the ancient people who lived there at that time are not the one's that live there today. <br>  <br>  Most Arabs know their history and it didn't take place in Egypt.

The 7 Woes in<br>  Matthew 23 is directed at religions<br>  and to its priests (no religionist<br>  will want to read this).<br>  <br>  <br>  We grew up with the Bible, ergo, we will refer to it<br>  to enlighten us somewhat (but not fully because<br>  THE GOD Had Closed it to our understanding).<br>  <br>  <br>  The Old Testament (just an excerpt from<br>  The Hebrew Manuscripts [since it was corrupted<br>  by the Jews and Roman Catholic Church]) speaks of<br>  a Chosen People, the Israelites, who lost that distinction<br>  when THE JEALOUS GOD Relinquished HIS Favor, so that<br>  technically and Biblically, there no longer is a Chosen People.<br>  <br>  <br>  And whatever the Adventists, Mormons and Christians declare<br>  (that is Scripturally out of context to begin with) has no basis<br>  (seeming that these religions Blaspheme THE CREATOR).<br>  Never mind the Hindus (with 30,000,000 gods)<br>  and the Korean Inification Church.<br>  <br>  <br>  Which leaves us with the Moslems (who accordingly<br>  and supposedly are descendants of Ishmael).

They are members of a deceptive Christian cult.    <br>  <br>  Rather than following the tenants of Judaism, “messianic Jews” (1) worship Jesus, (2) believe in virgin birth, (3) believe that sins are atoned by human sacrifice, (4) believe in the divinity of Jesus, (5) believe that Jesus was the son of God, (6) read, study, and follow the New Testament, etc., etc., etc--all these things and much more that they do and believe in are Christian and NONE of these things are Jewish. Therefore, calling themselves Jews as they do is nothing but FRAUDULENT, DECEPTIVE, and DESPICABLE. It is sickening and pathetic how they insert THEIR worship of Jesus, who is irrelevant to us, into all of OUR holidays and holy days and claim the result is Judaism. What they are doing as far as Judaism is concerned is nothing less than blasphemy.<br>  <br>  No Jew on earth accepts them as being any part of our religion in any way. They should be denounced by everyone who stands up for righteousness and honor and truthfulness.  People who feel the need to take up what they think is a Jewish lifestyle without letting go of their Christian beliefs really need to come up with another name for themselves rather than misappropriate ours.

There are 52 1/7 weeks in every year, yes; but we do not redistribute the extra fraction of a week like we do with the extra fraction of a day.

They DO deserve the right to be treated, housed, fed, and killed in a kind and humane way.  Factory farming is whats immoral, not eating meat, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Unfortunatly, the world is over populated.  Its true that American culture is wasteful, but even without that waste, with the current world population, it is impossible to feed everyone without some sort of factory farming.  Even if the entire world went vegan, our crops would have to be genetically altered to produce far more food than what they do by nature. Genetically enginered crops is also a hot and controversial topic.

I think I would feel basically comfortable if I had been born into any religion.  Hopefully the religion would encourage me to maximize whatever truth I had, and to be apt to learn.  I assume I would still have my basic personality traits in some degree.<br>  <br>  I am a Latter-day Saint.  If not, then... not necessarily in order of preference...<br>  <br>  For doctrinal consistency, I would choose Catholicism of either kind, although I think as a Catholic I may prefer to become some form of Gnostic.  Judaism?  Certainly, but I would rather hope to be orthodox, again for consistency.<br>  <br>  For lifestyle similarity, I would choose evangelicalism or some kind of Christian fundamentalism.  Otherwise, Presbyterian.  I would be fine as a Southern Baptist.<br>  <br>  I look fondly on Zoroastrianism, dwindling though it may be, because of what I see as Abrahamic influences.<br>  <br>  For structural integrity, I would perhaps be a Sunni Muslim, but I would personally rather be a Sufi Muslim, or especially Druze, as I am drawn to reformism.  I could get along well as a Baha'i.<br>  <br>  For oriental... If I had been Buddhist, I would want to be a shamanistic, Confucianist Tibetan Buddhist such as were had in Mongolia because of their great respect.  I'm not sure how much I would like straight Buddhism, the major schools -- I would enjoy the encircling logic, but I suspect it might drive me crazy eventually, since I would want to take it all as seriously as I could.  If I were Hindu, I think I would be happy, but at the same time, depending on my family, I might be strongly tempted to convert out of it -- I'm sure at least I would be a student of neighbouring faiths.  Loving seclusion and introspection, I think I would be at relative peace as a Shintoist or, for that matter, one of our pagan naturists; and I class Daoism with Shintoism.<br>  <br>  Back on home soil, for sheer independence as well as strong conservatism, I would be a Jehovah's Witness.  Also for reasons of mental independence, I would be fine with being born atheist; but first, I would hope for the old deism.  I doubt I would be wholly atheist; I would find some cause or some science to associate religiously with.<br>  <br>  I don't know how long I would last as a Wiccan -- I think I would not get along terribly well with my fellows...  Likewise, I would not especially hope to be a Unitarian or a Lutheran, owing to personality differences with those I have met.  And least of all would I like to adhere to old Greek philosophies.  Well, I guess the worst would be post-renaissance humanism.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm still a stranger to many religions, and could probably better judge those I do know with more experience.

Many atheists tend toward secular philosophies such as humanism[5] and naturalism,[6], but, as for theists, there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere.[7] Some religions, such as Jainism and Buddhism, do not require belief in a personal god.<br>  <br>  The term atheism originated as a pejorative epithet applied to any person or belief in conflict with established religion.[8][9] With the spread of freethought, scientific skepticism, and criticism of religion, the term began to gather a more specific meaning and has been increasingly used for self-description by atheists.|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	I am roman catholic<br>  <br>  If I were to step away from the roman catholic church, I would first go to an eastern denomination of Catholicism.<br>  <br>  If I were to abandon christianity all together, I would probably become something of a mystic, not attached to any religion.|`|VRl1jENHaa	I could never follow another religion "besides" my current one, which is Christianity.  But if you meant to ask, what religion would I be if my religion didn't exist, then that's easy for me to answer:  I would be a Karaite Jew, because I am convinced of three things:<br>  <br>  1)  the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is the only true God;<br>  2)  Judaism in its pure form (NOT in the messed up form practiced today) is true; and<br>  3)  the Rabbinic "traditions" as recorded in places such as the Talmud are made up by men who did not love God in their hearts, they only loved the adoration they received from people.  These "traditions" have turned the Jewish people away from God, not toward Him.  Because the Karaites reject the "traditions," this is the sect within Judaism to which I would belong.|`|d7rOO1Zwaa	None.<br>  <br>  I don't follow belief systems, period.

5N3odm3Qaa	I value intelligence above all else. Closely following intellectual capacity are success, accomplishment, and potential. Respect is important and expected. I do not specifically value it because I expect it as a human courtesy. I value responsibility and doing what's most logical, rather than what is most emotionally satisfying. In other words, I respect a teenager who has an abortion because she elected not to ruin her future.<br>  <br>  I do not value the concept of a family, though I tremendously value my relationship with my significant other. And I value honoring my parents.<br>  <br>  I also value my health. I will not tan just for the sake of tanning because I am very aware that skin cancer is a real threat. I do not smoke. I drink very minimally.
AA11440601	Ask God for help and practice, practice, practice.<br>  <br>  English is a weak language for talking about different kinds of love. The Greek of the New Testament is much better:<br>  ? Eros: Romantic love<br>  ? Philia: Brotherly (or sisterly) love<br>  ? Storge: Parental love<br>  ? Agape: Godly love<br>  <br>  Eros and philia are based on emotions and storge is almost an instinct.<br>  <br>  But Agape is a decision to wish for the best for someone.<br>  <br>  Christians are commanded to love (agape) their neighbors and enemies. This does not mean we have to like them or approve of their actions. <br>  <br>  This love (agape) is almost impossible to do without God's help.<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|4Vmlf902aa	If you put some effort into it i'm sure they'll forgive you.|`|Icwz678Qaa	"If you love only those who love you, what good is that?

I know.  I grew up in that same type of situation.  What I learned to do was to surround myself with positive and kind people as often as possible.  Also, when you think about the people that you have to be around who act negatively; try to separate the people from their behavior.  You can love the person, even if you hate their behavior.<br>  <br>  Also, try focusing on the positive things about people.  People can do 9 wonderful things and 1 bad thing; and, most people will focus forever on that 1 bad thing.  <br>  <br>  You can have many people look at one action or behavior and every single one can come up with different reactions.  This shows that what is happening is not exactly negative or positive.  It is only the perception of the person observing the situtation.<br>  <br>  You might check out this book.

BSt7ji9Xaa	people who were "outcasted or shunned" in highschool are usually weak and very passive people.. Ive met a number of people in highschool who thought they were the S!hitt and tried to control people but usually the ones they ended up controlling were passive and didnt talk back.. If they had more aggressivness to there personality they wouldnt of been outcasted or "shunned" in highschool.. people wouldnt walk all over them.. again its usually the "nice" people it happens to.. and ive seen it time and time again.. now the parents of these kids usually are strickt and the kids are taught to "speak when spoken too" and "ignore" people who are rude to you--- that never works you stand up for yourself and beat the c!rap out of them.. never failed me at all ..<br>  <br>  <br>  My current girlfriend is really nice and sweet and when we were in highschool she got walked all over cause of that.. I was one of the "popular kids" and i didnt really give to rats about her in highschool but decpite the fact that people pushed her around she still gave me a chance and has nothing negative to say about the people who pushed her around.. shes a rare one a definite keeper in my book.. i think it takes a real nice person to let that slide by them if that were me i would of taken revenege to the NEXT level if you know what i mean.. i still feel horible for not beating the crap out of ppl for walking all over her.. I was one of them but definitly if we were still in highschool would of beat the crap out of them.. im friends with none of them now.|`|wh3BAc4taa	I have been an outcast for a few years.

She has a moment of glory in battle, but Achilles kills her. The Greek warrior Thersites later taunts Achilles, claiming that he had been in love with her, and Achilles kills him too. Achilles is ritually purified for the murder of Thersites.<br>  <br>  Next another Trojan ally arrives, Memnon, son of Eos and Tithonus, leading an Ethiopian contingent and wearing armour made by the god Hephaestus. In battle Memnon kills Antilochus, a Greek warrior who was the son of Nestor and a great favourite of Achilles. Achilles then kills Memnon, and Zeus makes Memnon immortal at Eos' request. But in his rage Achilles pursues the Trojans into the very gates of Troy, and in the Scaean Gates he is killed by an arrow shot by Paris, assisted by the god Apollo. Achilles' body is rescued by Ajax and Odysseus.

But I do think there are actually two sides many times, and not always the same side saying two things. The holocaust actually aided in Americans opening their eyes to realize their own cruelty and racism. You're right, it was hypocritical--but it did change greatly. But I also agree with the others, for the most part--I think people don't realize they are prejudice---they are tolerant, but not actually accepting. Sometimes their views are mixed---like one is all for multi-ethnicities being together, but fear them procreating out of the thought that it will cause one side to die out, or change the religion and values. I think people can be prejudice without meaning or wanting to be, if they are religious--fearing that their children or friends will not find peace because they opened their minds to something other than what they were raised to follow. They also fear that they will be punished, or just feel gried if they did not do doing anything about it. I bring up religion because its a war that I don't think will ever go away. I think they are just stuck, and not knowing what to do about their conflicting values.<br>  As for racism out of dumb things---like stereotypes, or hating another culture just because...It will always take a long time for most to stop because they just simple can't stand the other side---they sometimes think the other side hates them first. Racism, war, and hate will probably never go away.

This, indeed, is the biggest favor from Allah to this Ummah, for He has completed their religion for them, and they, thus, do not need any other religion or any other Prophet except Muhammad . This is why Allah made Muhammad the Final Prophet and sent him to all humans and Jinn. Therefore, the permissible is what he allows, the impermissible is what he prohibits, the Law is what he legislates and everything that he conveys is true and authentic and does not contain lies or contradictions. Allah said;<br>  <br>  <br>  [????????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ?????????]<br>  <br>  <br>  (And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice,) meaning, it is true in what it conveys and just in what it commands and forbids.

The ones that people wrote down during his life time were burned because he forbade people in the same collection of ahadith to write anything down from him other than the Qur'an. <br>  <br>  See the references here:<br>  <br>  Ahadith books have enough material to direct the sincere believer to stick ONLY to the Qur'an as Allah ordered us. We do not need the proof herein from the ahadith books, but we include it here to show the how Allah plans to expose the disbelievers and the hypocrites <br>  <br>  (1) Ibn Saeed Al-Khudry reported that the messenger of Allah had said, <br>  <br>  "Do not write anything from me EXCEPT QUR'AN. Anyone who wrote anything other than the Qur'an shall erase it." <br>  <br>  The following historical incident happened about 30 years after the death of the Prophet Muhammed and shows that the Prophet never canceled his order not to write but the Qur'an. The ahadith books however contained some fabricated ahadith that are considered by the SAME ahadith scholars as VERY WEAK, trying to indicate that Muhammed changed his view about writing the ahadith. The readers of the hadith to follow, that happened about 30 years after the death of the Prophet, will conclude by themselves that the Prophet Muhammed never authorized the writing of the ahadith since the time he told his followers not to write but the Qur'an..... <br>  <br>  (2) From Ibn Hanbal; <br>  <br>  Zayd Ibn Thabit (The Prophet's closest revelation writer) visited the Khalifa Mu'aawiyah (more than 30 years after the Prophet's death), and told him a story about the Prophet. Mu'aawiyah liked the story and ordered someone to write it down. But Zayd said. " the messenger of Allah ordered us NEVER to write anything of his hadith," <br>  <br>  (3) The famous book, "Ulum Al-Hadith" by Ibn Al-Salah, reports a hadith by Abu Hurayra in which Abu Hurayra said the messenger of Allah came out to us while we were writing his ahadith and said; "What are you writing?" We said, "Hadiths that we hear from you, messenger of Allah." He said, "A book other than the book of Allah ?!" We said, "Should we talk about you?" He said, Talk about me, that would be fine, but those who will lie will go to Hell. Abu Hurayra said, we collected what we wrote of ahadith and burned them in fire. "<br>  <br>  (4) In the famous book, "Taq-yeed Al-Ilm", Abu Hurayra said, the messenger of Allah was informed that some people are writing his ahadith. He took to the pulpit of the mosque and said, "What are these books that I heard you wrote? I am just a human being. Anyone who has any of these writings should bring it here. Abu Hurayra said we collected all these and burned them in fire." <br>  <br>  (5) Ibn Hanbal in his Musnad book, narrates a hadith in which Abdullah Ibn Omar said, "the messenger of Allah one day came out to us as if he was going to depart us soon and said, "When I depart you (die), hold to the book of Allah, prohibit what it prohibits and accept as halal what it makes halal." <br>  <br>  He never mentioned the Sunna in this Ahadith. <br>  <br>  (6) Again, in the book "Taq-yeed Al-Ilm", Abu Saeed Al-Khudry said, " I asked the messenger of Allah a permission to write his ahadith, but he refused to give me a permission." <br>  <br>  (7) The farewell Pilgrimage of the Prophet Muhammed is a corner stone in the Muslim history. The Final Sermon given by the Prophet during this pilgrimage was witnessed by thousands of Muslims. There are however THREE versions of this sermon in the ahadith books. This by itself reflects the degree of corruption of the ahadith books as this is the most witnessed speech of the prophet Muhammed. <br>  <br>  1- First version, " I left for you what if you hold up to, you will never be misguided, the book of Allah and my Family. Muslim 44/4, Nu2408; Ibn Hanbal 4/366; <br>  darimi 23/1, nu 3319. <br>  This is the version made up by the Shiite Muslims. <br>  <br>  2-Second version, "I left for you what if you hold up to, you will never be misguided, the book of Allah and my Sunnah" . Muwatta, 46/3 <br>  This is the version made up by the Sunni Muslims. <br>  <br>  3- Third version, "I left for you what if you hold up to, you will never be misguided, the BOOK OF ALLAH." <br>  Muslim 15/19, nu 1218; Ibn Majah 25/84, Abu dawud 11/56. <br>  And ONLY the book of ALLAH.<br>  <br>  This is the version hated by the Sunni and Shiite Muslims alike. This is the ONLY version that agrees with the repeated assertion in the Qur'an that Muhammed's message is ONLY the QUR'AN. Many Sunni Muslims and Shiite Muslims do not even know that this version of the sermon exists. In reality, they do not want to know.<br>  <br>  Enough said! <br>  <br>  Peace,<br>  <br>  Tiffy"|`|qrQVW772aa	Wa alaykumsalaam Sister<br>  <br>  Jazak'Allah Khairan <br>  <br>  Subhan Allah Alhamdulillah Wa Allah Akbar<br>  <br>  Thank you so much for sharing, May Allah Give you sucess, protect, Imaan, Sabr, Taqwa,  Noor, And  i the the best reward...May Allah grant you Jannah and protect you against the fire of Jahanum<br>  <br>  Incha'Allah Ameen Ameen Ameen|`|hcwu9mOhaa	Did they tape recorded that ?|`|JNr86XAVaa	Nice.Well done|`|dtXwnjYUaa	may Allah bless u<br>  Prophet muhammad (pbuh) ordered his campanions 2 only write the quran in his life time and not the hadith so that they won't be mixed.<br>  they collected the hadith from his campanions after his (pbuh) death.
pnZssBg9aa	I personally think the media is too overrated on White Caucasian models and Eurasian models as ideals of beauty.<br>  Even more so Eurasian and Mulatto (mixed black and white) models because mixed race people are apparently more attractive due to genetic mixing  compared to being just monoracial.<br>  But because of European Colonialism and perceived Western influence of society worldwide, anything looking remotely Caucasian, even mixed race, is celebrated compared to black or Asian models. It is sad but true as many people still think White/Western Culture = Supreme and the same goes for models. It is objectification at its worst.|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	Most of the people who run the media are white, and most of the public is white.

Cosmetic companies have finally started to realize that the minority dollar spends just like the Caucasian one and we have just as much of a desire to look good. However, other aspects of the media certainly can catch up, specifically the entertainment industry. From articles that I have read, good television and film roles for women are few and far between. And the majority of those roles as we all know do not go to the women in question. So, from my standpoint it would be nice to see more Asian and Black women in prominent roles in entertainment.|`|jezmhaV0aa	That depends on the market these companies are catering to. Also the location...its all relative to the demographic. For instance, I contacted the popular design mag SURFACE about its lack of having models of color in its advertisements. But what i failed to realize that as a fashion/interior design publication, they were just focusing on the market with the most readership. (Consensus shows that 72% of the ppl in the fashion/design industry are predominately white women ages 19-35) <br>  So, its hard to take lack of diversity too personally for most companies...its a matter of exposure.|`|b2276382725a0bce8479b4c02cdb38b3aa	they do already im sorry. Lines like Revlon's, covergirl, maybeline, pantene, etc have products available to all women. In there commercials they have all women represented.

There are some (not  a lot i agree) that are dark, but they aren't household names. I saw a dark girl on the Ambi skin care line commercials. In hte victoria secret catalogs there are dark girls.

Less in terms of beauty and more in terms of desensitizing the U.S.  That sounds so bad, however it's a reality, for me especially.  To this day, and I'm 30, I have yet to see enough commercials with a WOMAN of my complexion so that I can stop counting them on one hand.  It's an issue for many reasons that I don't have time to get into.<br>  <br>  I do understand that there are reasons why we aren't "celebrated" more.  Financially, it isn't advantageous and secondly, I think it has something to do with only showing a percentage of the majority/minority on television.  Just enough so we aren't completely ignored.<br>  <br>  **Chai I do understand and mostly agree, however, Queen Latifah and Halle Berry aren't half as dark as I am.|`|SUMV525Aaa	Yeah they definitely should.

Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity)." Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle got angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of Allah's Apostle. <br>  <br>  *Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 53, Number 325<br>  <a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/053.sbt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NOW TELL ME !<br>  <br>  Was Fatima (S.A) angry on Abu Bakr or not?

I personally do not have any problem with that if Ali RA really has written Nahjal blaghah.<br>  <br>  But, what is guanrantee that this book is not a taqiya tactic?<br>  according to your own source Ali RA did taqiya when his wife who was daughter of Prophet got attacked. SubhanAllah!!<br>  <br>  edit: you explantion still does not solve the problem. what did Ali do after that?<br>  <br>  Edit: Sunni source?? What do you mean by sunni source? Is not this another taqiya tactic. If any Ahlus Sunnah writes a book, it does not become sunni source. For such sensitive topic we need AUTHENTIC source and anything said or transfered by sunni does not become authentic. Many Ahlus Sunnah scholars has written history without taking any responsibilty of what they write. They just tell us what they heard from others and it is upon us to confirm the integrity of those who communicated.<br>  <br>  Edit: To know what is authentic source, you need to know science of Asma ul Rijaal. If you do not know search on the net. Muhadditheen have categorise all the ahadith into weak, fabricated, hasan and saheeh. Just the presence of a tradition does not make it "sunni stance" it need to be "saheeh" perticularly in critical issues.|`|h6NUE6VTaa	btw pedram the story about Omar hitting Fatima not all shia believe in it,only those we follow Khomeini.<br>  here in Lebanon they r divided and those who follow Hussein fadlallah doesn't believe in this story and i tell u why:<br>  cz back when i used to be shia i was always taught that Ali (ra) is the smartest,the strongest....<br>  so if he was the  strongest how he allowed Omar to attack his wife?and as a man of dignity how he can allowed to any men enter his house with force and attack his family?<br>  why didn't he protect his family?<br>  is Ali(ra) weak,doesn't have any courage....the shia who follows Khomeini and believe in this story r degrading the statue of imam Ali(ra),u reduce the man to a coward one!!!!!<br>  <br>  i never heard about this sunni reference that u have post.<br>  <br>  now i know that u want to say tha Ali(ra) was the most knowledgeable person on the time of prophet,maybe he was i don't mind,what's the big deal nway if he was but by book u mean nahjul balagha,well most of shia doesn't have it complete my bro has it whole and he got  it from here in Lebanon(its an allowed version of the book by the iranian embassy in damascus),this book was not written by imam Ali(ra) it was collect by others from his khoutba........<br>  <br>  so for me it isn't a very authentic book,but to answer ur Q in my opinion during the time of the prophet(pbuh),he (pbuh) was the most knowledgeable
423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	I had read this story already. If you read the history you will find more interesting and knowledgeable stories in which Imam Ali (A.S) helped. <br>  <br>  Imam was once asked by an Arab that what is the distance between the sun and the earth? Imam Said that if you start travelling on your horse, you will reach the sun in 500 years. <br>  <br>  Explaination:<br>  The speed of an average Arab horse is app. 22mph. i.e<br>  <br>  22*500*24*354= 93456000 miles (an avg. islamic calender contains 354 days in a year). This is the app. distance acc. to today science too.

AA11923447	In my personal opinion (and many will disagree with me), the commandment against killing is more important. Then again, I'm a Christian pacifist. However, I am not a "defenseless" pacifist; I will defend myself if attacked. I am not against the right to bear arms, but I feel that in terms of moral priorities, refraining from murdering one's fellow human beings trumps the right to bear arms. Still, owning weaponry does not necessarily mean that one is going to kill (such as practicing marksmanship), and it doesn't mean that one is procuring arms for the sake of killing humans (as in the killing of animals for food). Whether or not the commandment against killing includes animals is a whole different debate.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	The 6th commandment.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	I like the 2/6 combined approach: Speak softly and carry a big stick.<br>  <br>  Pretty much the WMD policy, isn't it?|`|i48kxrbaaa	I can live without a weapon.<br>  I can live a whole lot better without murders/killings.|`|cKuppxUQaa	We have the right to bear arms to protect our homes but that doesn't mean we want that right so we can commit murder.|`|luwBPdE8aa	Do you ever kill an insect?<br>  God gave man dominion over the animals.|`|cYwmT9xPaa	Redo<br>  <br>  What is right to bear arms vs the commandments of God?<br>  <br>  6th Commandment<br>  <br>  "Thou shalt not kill." Exodus 20:13<br>  <br>  When God writes something with His own finger that means they are all important.  Anybody who thinks its okay to break one commandment is guilty of breaking them all<br>  <br>  "For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all" (James 2:10)<br>  <br>  You are comparing the amendments with the commandments and I tell you that the law of God is much more important and should be honored over the law of man. <br>  <br>  it is very clear the the Ten Commandments, written by Gods own finger, is important al,l ten, the firsst four are in reference to love for God, last 6 is for the Love of your neighbor.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|89UOqaVNaa	Why should one have to pick one or the other?<br>  <br>  Of course God said, "Thou shalt not kill" but if someone else is about to break that commandment and wants to kill you or someone else, it's your right and duty to defend yourself or your family or your neighbour.<br>  <br>  The right to bear arms was also a way to protect society if the government goes bad. One person with a gun can control masses without one.<br>  <br>  If only we could learn from history. Look at what the Nazis did to the Jews. Just one example of a government going bad. One thing that was outlawed was for people to have guns. Gun control is the first step towards tyranny and total government control.<br>  <br>  “Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.” --Cesare Beccaria, quoted by Thomas Jefferson|`|hVVALFAPaa	The sixth commandment is more important, not just because of the importance of human life, but because it was given to us by God.<br>  <br>  BTW: The second amendment gives us the right to protect ourselves and also to use the arms for hunting or to feed our families. My family owns several guns that have never been fired at another human, but have been used to provide nourishment to us.<br>  <br>  <br>  The amendment was given to us by humans, and is therefore less important than laws given to us by God.|`|6a1ce2ab43657c5b8abeb67e6a9dacf7aa	They are both equal.<br>  <br>  The law says we are not to kill.<br>  But, if our lives are in danger, that is when we would need the right to bear arms, to protect us and our families.|`|AA11743216	The bible is final<br>  Government should never replace it<br>  <br>  Jesus said the princes will rule over the gentiles<br>  BUT so shall it NOT be amoung you|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Which do most people agree to regardless of religion? 6th commandment....because that's just common sense, not so much because it was written in the bible.|`|Wo1BkKTBaa	The 2nd.

If you are looking for an explination you should read the Genesis. You know, not all that Jesus did had an explination, like how he cured the sick and revived, etc. He did it because he can... because he is God. So, Jesus came and died for us and you want to know what happened to his clothes? You should start giving more importance for what he did for you than for what happened to his clothes. Just have in mind that even if you don't believe in Him, God still believes in you.

Otherwise were stuck with no explanation at all. <br>  <br>  Jesus did not become a god.  Where did you get that idea?  Jesus is God.  He took on a human nature through the incarnation (being born).  He still has a human body.  It's as much a part of him now as ours is of us.  The bit about clothing would take pages even to begin explaining.<br>  <br>  Now for you main question:  the natural and supernatural worlds are connected through us.  This is exactly why God created humankind in His image.  We are to stand for God in the world as a bridge between a Spirit God and His physical creation.  <br>  <br>  peace<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I don't mean to sound dogmatic.  I'm working from the assumptions you make in your question.  But I realize you don't really hold these assumptions yourself.

It would be all around this world as we see it just as this world is all around what you call the 'supernatural' world.

tx4bRDrXaa	(2 Timothy 3:1-5) But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. 2?For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, 3?having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, 4?betrayers, headstrong, puffed up [with pride], lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, 5?having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.6-7) For from these arise those men who slyly work their way into households and lead as their captives weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires, 7?always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is speaking of the attitudes of people in the last days and we certainly can see that this is the case.It is speaking of counterfiet Christians who say they know and love God but their faith has no power over them to make them do what is right.So they would say one thing but in the meantime mislead others in the paths of unrighteousness thus never coming to a knowledge of the truth and from these turn away.Or do not be like them.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, <br>  2 Tim 3:7<br>   7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <br>  <br>  Signs of the apostasy were evident even in Paul's day, so that false teachers found it easy to lead away the unwary and the unstable.   <br>  <br>  Load captive silly women laden with sins] Sin-laden souls are easily led from the truth. For instance: In their carnal state they find it easier to believe their sins are removed simply by confessing the Lord Jesus with their lips, or through the performance of some act of penitence, rather than by following the hard and rugged course of seeking repentance in tears and anguish.   <br>  <br>  Paul speaks here of the direful spiritual darkness that covers the earth in the dispensation of the fulness of times, the seeds of which were even then sprouting among the meridian Christians. This apostasy, spawned by Satan and nurtured in lust, has increased and abounded for two millenniums-until it is universal and all pervading; until God himself has quoted Paul's very words in describing it; until the perilous times following the restoration of the gospel; until this final period of the earth's temporal continuance in which we now live; and it shall continue until the cup of iniquity overflows; until the Lord shall return to take vengeance on the wicked; until he shall come to destroy and burn and consume every ungodly thing and to usher in his own era of millennial righteousness.|`|v0BCIQpnaa	You're in 2 Timothy, but it relates to what he said in 1 Timothy.<br>  <br>  Lets put it into context.  This verse talks about men who who are always learning, but never coming to the knoweledge of the truth.  <br>  These men "worm" (slimy buggers they are) their way into the homes of "weak-willed women".  These would be women have difficulty saying "no", or "get out of my house".  Women are not supposed to be doormats.  <br>  <br>  I know lots of people who have learned a lot and continue to learn, but the knowledge of the truth is clarified in 1 Timothy 2:4 ....(God) who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. (now here it is....) 5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself as a ransom for all men-<br>  <br>  So, here is the Pauls message in it's context.<br>  <br>  2TI 3:1 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God-- 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.<br>  <br>      2TI 3:6 They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, 7 always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth. <br>  <br>  Bri ; )|`|de109ccf1349bcb7dcc5e78fb10fcbe6aa	The bible is full of put downs toward women.

The "Lucky 7" dice roll is found on quite a lot of hoodoo curio packaging, including 7-day candles; the character called Lady Luck, in her Irish-Amewrican World War Two incarnation, wears dice for earrings and they always show 7. These "Lucky 7" images all derive from the dice game of craps, where rolling 7 wins, and thus the dice that roll 7 are a symbol of gambler's luck|`|fcLKENTiaa	Because people are ******* morons.|`|gac0mn8uaa	Religion, it comes up in christianity for example alot.|`|jBYxEX8taa	Never heard of that.

AA12203324	There were a few saints that were so acclaimed while they were alive. (Francis of Assisi was one I think.)  But live humans are unpredictable, so the Church usually prefers to wait until they are safely dead.  It's a quality control, seal-of-approval type of deal.  By canonizing a saint, the Church declares that the saint is bone fide, without insisting that there aren't other, unrecognized saints.  The saint's life can safely be studied for inspiration, and the saint's proven virtue guarantees that his/her prayers, when asked, will be heard by God.  And some of them are specialists, patrons of certain causes.  It's kind of like finding a librarian who specializes in medieval romance when you're trying to locate a rare classic, or getting hold of the right nurse or orderly when you want attention from the head of surgery,<br>  <br>  The advice they might offer would be indirect, of course. (e.g. their petition motivates God to send someone or something that can help.)  But there are still those living, unrecognized saints you can go to.  They tend to stand out even without ecclesiastical approval.|`|Z6TNsJluaa	Born Again and Holy Spirit filled Christians are the Saints of God..The Saints who have died in the Lord are now awaiting the Rapture of the Church to receive their glorified Body, as the living saints will all in a twinkling of an eye..|`|qxteTM9Kaa	People don't need to be declared a saint,the saints were and are the followers of Jesus|`|i6QfwNTJaa	fear is the reason.|`|n7uzcdRbaa	Is is a money spinner for the Holy Romans.

qPSkkPqwaa	Walekum Assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu...<br>  <br>  1) I can not resist shaitan very well. It just flows you know, irritation after irritation, frustation after frustation, by Allah's will and Mercy shaitan stops after sometime but wont give up, will try to decieve me every now and then.<br>  <br>  Your question:<br>  <br>  2) After every stress or problem, peace follows it. So the thoughts u mentioned ur getting is just a waswasa (misgiving). Waswasa is unvoluntary thoughts shaitan puts. If we want to get rid of it we say the tawwuz = Auzu Billahi Minash Shaitanir rajeem and u can say Auzubillahi minash Shaitani Amantu Billahi wa Rasoolehi. And then you have to ignore them.  We are not accountable for these waswasa's unless we act upon it (i.e believe it to be true ). Waswasa are usually irritating and frustating. Waswasa also are bad thoughts abt ur deen. Once two sahabi's or 2 people or so came to Rasulullah (saws) and complained about these. They said they hated the thoughts so much that they better not tell abt it. IMagine they not telling the thoughts to Muhammad (saws)! THis shows how severe the thoughts were. Because that time Nabi (saws) helped the people, but THESE TWO PEOPLE DINT MENTION THE THOUGHTS!!!!! So Rasulullah (saws) said that If you really experience those thoughts (and hate them alot) then indeed this is clear Imaan (faith)...<br>  <br>  Ignore them dear. <br>  <br>  It is very pleasing that you want to be good Muslim.

As for increasing your imaan, do what I do and watch Islamic videos on youtube. Look up videos of new Muslims, they all have beautiful stories as to why they became Muslim.

Please help me.<br>  <br>  <br>  ANSWER:<br>  <br>  Praise be to Allaah. <br>  <br>  On this site there is an essay entitled “Weakness of Faith, which gives a detailed description of the weakness of faith that many people suffer, and explains the causes and the remedy. We advise you to read it. Here is the link: <br>  <br>  [<a href="http://63.175.194.25/books/dofuleeman/en..." rel="nofollow">http://63.175.194.25/books/dofuleeman/en...</a> <br>  <br>  There follow two pieces of advice from major scholars, in addition to the above, summing up what is required on your part: <br>  <br>  1 – We advise you to read Qur’aan a great deal, listen to its recitation and ponder the meanings of what you read and listen to, as much as you can. If you find anything difficult to understand then ask the scholars in your country or write to other Sunni scholars for advice. <br>  <br>  We also advise you to remember Allaah a great deal (dhikr) with the dhikrs narrated in the saheeh ahaadeeth, such as “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (there is no god except Allaah)”, “Subhaan-Allaah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wa Allaahu akbar (Glory be to Allaah, praise be to Allaah, there is no god except Allaah and Allaah is Most Great)”, and so on. For more information on this see al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Ibn Taymiyah; al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim; Riyaadh al-Saaliheen [available in English]; al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah by Imaam al-Nawawi, and so on. <br>  <br>  Remembering Allaah (dhikr) increases faith and brings peace of mind. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “verily, in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find rest”<br>  <br>  [al-Ra’d 13:28] <br>  <br>  Regularly perform acts of worship such as prayer, fasting and the other pillars of Islam, whilst hoping for the mercy of Allaah and putting your trust in Him in all your affairs. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “The believers are only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Qur’aan) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone);<br>  <br>  Who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat?as? Salaah) and spend out of that We have provided them.<br>  <br>  It is they who are the believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness and a generous provision (Paradise).” [al-Anfaal 8:2] <br>  <br>  Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, 3/185, 186 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2 – Faith is also increased by obeying Allaah, and it decreases when one disobeys Him. So adhere to doing that which Allaah has enjoined such as performing the prayers on time in congregation in the mosque, praying zakaah willingly to purify yourself of sin and show compassion towards the poor and needy, sitting with good and righteous people so that they will help you to apply sharee’ah and guide you to that which will bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.<br>  <br>  Avoid the followers of bid’ah and sinners, lest they tempt you and weaken your resolve to do good.<br>  <br>  Do a lot of voluntary good actions, turn to Allaah, and ask Him for strength.<br>  <br>  If you do that, Allaah will increase you in faith and you will make up for lost time, and Allaah will increase you in goodness and steadfastness in adhering to Islam.<br>  <br>  Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, 3/187.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid<br>  <br>  i ask ALLAH(swt) to guide us all and protect our faith.amiiin.<br>  <br>  salam sister...if u need anything email me and i ask ALLAH(swt) to give me the knowledge to help u.amin. and la hawla wa la kowata illa b LLAH.|`|4aveC2aaaa	you read Quran when waking up and before sleeping. which include:<br>  - Al Fatiha<br>  - Al Ikhlas<br>  - Al Nas<br>  - Al Falaq<br>  - Ayat al Kursee<br>  <br>  keep saying "Authu billah min al shaytan al rajeem"<br>  <br>  listen to Quran as much as possible<br>  <br>  make wudu before sleeping, and sleep on your right side, as Muhammad (asws)<br>  <br>  >wake up early and pray Fajr<br>  >pray all your prayers on time<br>  >you can fast Mondays and Thursdays for extra ajr. <br>  >there are also "ayam beedth" (white days) of each Islamic month that you can also fast.<br>  >obey your parents and please them after pleasing Allah, for your parents are a gateway to Jannah<br>  >pray some prayers in the Masjid (mosque)<br>  <br>  best of luck sis ^_^
4aveC2aaaa	my grandfather was possessed with a jinn a couple of months before he died. it was terrible, the things the jinn said and did through my grandfather. eventually, after keeping the Quran on and up all day for everyday, the Jinn kind of left on its own. and sometimes, my grandfather would not know what had happened. It was really sad the things my grandfather was going through. <br>  <br>  Yes, we believe in Jinn and they are not all bad ones. There are some good jinn out there|`|qPSkkPqwaa	1) No i have not had any encounters, Alhamdulilah.<br>  <br>  2) Yes, only Muslims believe in Jinn. Non-muslims show on television that they seen ghosts (paranormal state show etc..)|`|NlQhkgFCaa	Not really but once I was driving late past a mosque in Ramadhaan close to Fajr time and I think I saw one reading Salaah, it was very whiteish and strange looking but not scary, must've been a Pak Jinn|`|iUL0GU3paa	nope...but muslims believe in jinns...there is some good ones and bad ones =)|`|24GV16gVaa	i haven't met a jinn but i dont think i want to <br>  no i dont think that muslims are the only ppl who believe in them cause lots of people believe in them <br>  ever heard of things called "demons"?<br>  <br>  <br>  people can be verrrrrrrrrry superstitious :)|`|yDBkQG8maa	Yes, we, as Muslims, believe in Jinns.<br>  <br>  Many of them have "seen" them or "experience" them.<br>  <br>  I have had many stories about them, but I will refrain from telling you.|`|FhXzlnDOaa	No one can have an encounter with a jinn because they don't exist.  Yes, only Muslims believe in Jinn and Muhammad was the only "prophet" who ever mentioned them.  Jinn were part of folklore.<br>  <br>  lol @ Cannicus<br>  <br>  Demons and jinn are not the same.  Never heard of a "good" demon before but Muslims believe in good and bad jinn.|`|zgL6vMCiaa	This indicates that the jinn may attack humans, and that they may harm them, as is known from real-life events. There are numerous reports which indicate that a man may come to a deserted area, and a stone may be thrown at him, but he does not see anybody, or he may hear voices or a rustling sound like the rustling of trees, and other things that may make him feel distressed and scared. A jinn may also enter the body of a human, either because of love or with the intention of harming him, or for some other reason. This is indicated in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):  <br>  <br>  ‘Those who eat Ribaa will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan (Satan) leading him to insanity’[al-Baqarah 2:275] <br>  <br>    In such cases, the jinn may speak from inside of that person and address the one who is reading verses from the Qur’aan over him; the reciter may take a promise from the jinn never to come back, and other things concerning which there are very many reports which are widespread among the people.  <br>  <br>  So the protection which will prevent the evil of the jinn is for a person to recite that which is narrated in the Sunnah as being effective in providing protection, such as Aayat al-Kurisy, for if a person recites Aayat al-Kursiy at night, he will continue to have protection from Allaah, and no shaytaan will come near him until morning. And Allaah is the Protector.’” <br>  <br>  (Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 1/287-288)  <br>  <br>  The Sunnah mentions adhkhaar (dhikr) by means of which one may gain protection from the shayaateen (devils). These include:  <br>  <br>  Seeking refuge with Allaah from the jinn:  <br>  <br>  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  <br>  <br>  “And if an evil whisper from Shaytaan (Satan) tries to turn you away (O Muhammad) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allaah. Verily, He is the All Hearer, the All Knower”[Fussilat 41:36]<br>  <br>   “And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytaan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allaah. Verily, He is All-Hearer, All-Knower”<br>  <br>  [al-A’raaf 7:200]  <br>  <br>  It was narrated from Sulaymaan ibn Sard that two men were trading insults in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them), until the face of one of them turned red. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I know a word which, if he were to say it, what he is suffering from would go away: ‘A’oodhu Billaahi min al-Shaytaan il-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan).’” <br>  <br>  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3108; Muslim, 2610)  <br>  <br>  2 – Reciting al-Mi’wadhatayn (the last two Soorahs of the Qur’aan, al-Falaq and al-Naas).  <br>  <br>  It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allaah from the jinn and from the evil eye until the Mi’wadhatayn were revealed, and when they were revealed he started to recite them and not anything else.” <br>  <br>  (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2058; he said it is hasan ghareeb. Also narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 5494; Ibn Maajah, 3511. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4905).  <br>  <br>  3 – Reciting Aayat al-Kursiy <br>  <br>   It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) put me in charge of guarding the zakaah of Ramadaan. Someone came to me and started grabbing handfuls of the food. I took hold of him and said, ‘I will take you to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ He said, ‘I will teach you some words by means of which Allaah will benefit you.’ I said, ‘What are they?’ He said, ‘When you go to your bed, recite this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah! Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyoom (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)…” [al-Baqarah 2:255] – until he completed the aayah. Then Allaah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no shaytaan (devil) will come near you until morning.’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked me, ‘What did your prisoner do last night?’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, he taught me something, and claimed that Allaah would benefit me by it.’ He said, ‘What was it?’ I said, ‘He taught me to recite Aayat al-Kursiy when I go to bed, and said that no shaytaan would come near me until morning, and that Allaah would appoint a guard for me who would stay with me.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘He told you the truth, although he is an inveterate liar. That was the Shaytaan.’” <br>  <br>  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3101) <br>  <br>    4 – Reciting Soorat al-Baqarah <br>  <br>   It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not make your houses like graves, for the Shaytaan runs away from a house in which Soorat al-Baqarah is recited.”(Narrated by Muslim, 780) <br>  <br>   5 – The last verses of Soorat al-Baqarah <br>  <br>   It was narrated that Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever recites the last two verses of Soorat al-Baqarah at night, that will suffice him.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4723; Muslim, 807) <br>  <br>   It was narrated from al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah inscribed a book two thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, from which the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah were revealed. If they are recited for three nights, no shaytaan (devil)will remain in the house). <br>  <br>  (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2882. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1799). <br>  <br>   6 – Reciting “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer (There is no god except Allaah Alone with no partner or associate; His is the Sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things)” one hundred times.  <br>  <br>  It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)  said: “Whoever says “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer” one hundred times in the day, will have a reward equivalent to that of freeing ten slaves, one hundred hasanahs (good deeds) will be recorded for him, and one hundred sayi’ahs (bad deeds) will be erased from his record, and it will be protection for him from the Shaytaan for that day, until evening comes. No one could achieve any better than him except the one who does more than he did.” <br>  <br>  (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 31119; Muslim, 2691)  <br>  <br>  7 – Remembering Allaah often (dhikr)  <br>  <br>  It was narrated from al-Haarith al-Ash’ari that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah commanded Yahyaa ibn Zakariyah (peace be upon him) five things to follow and to enjoin upon the Children of Israel… and he commanded them to remember Allaah, and the likeness of that is a man who was being pursued by the enemy, until he reached a strong fortress in which he found protection; similarly a man cannot find protection from the Shaytaan except by remembering Allaah…” <br>  <br>  (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2863; he said it is hasan saheeh. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1724)  <br>  <br>  8 – The adhaan  <br>  <br>  It was narrated that Suhayl ibn Abi Saalih said: “My father sent me to Bani Haarithah, and there was with me a slave of ours, or a companion of ours. Someone called out his name from a garden, and the one who was with me looked into the garden and did not see anything. I mentioned that to my father, and he said, ‘If I had known that this was going to happen to you, I would not have sent you. But if you hear a voice then make the call for prayer, for I heard Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrating that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the Shaytaan hears the call to prayer, he runs away fast.”’”(Narrated by Muslim, 389).  <br>  <br>  The word translated here as “runs away fast” may also mean “farting.”  <br>  <br>  9 – Reciting Qur’aan offers protection against the Shaytaan  <br>  <br>  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  <br>  <br>  “And when you (Muhammad) recite the Qur’aan, We put between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter, an invisible veil (or screen their hearts, so they hear or understand it not)[al-Israa’ 17:45]  <br>  <br>  And Allaah knows best.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid<br>  <br>  salam.
N73oZyY8aa	You got eyes, you can see, of course it's normal to look, just don't touch.|`|TPZZESeeaa	i don't think it's wrong to look, but it is wrong to touch. just because you aren't hungry doesn't mean you can't look at the menu|`|36b213c16926132fde2d00722cbf60d3aa	I think that it is normal to want to look at attractive people. If you feel bad about it do what I use to do. When you're with your gf say "man, that chick is hot" and then ask what she thinks. She will be involved and you still get to do it. As long as you are not cheating on her, there is absolutely nothing wrong.|`|1fb81d84c2bb2c6b8a0d28409f3c4b80aa	I think its perfectly normal. Dont druel over her, but ya, its normal. WIth your "history" it could get a little tricky....but thats were trust comes in, and as long as you got that....look all you want|`|hacd7Yz6aa	Once a cheater always a cheater...|`|MWIKAz9Oaa	Nothing wrong with it :)|`|61wMfK9Uaa	Given the option, with no consequences, would you prefer a night with your current girlfriend ('the one') or one of these random hot chicks you see?<br>  <br>  As a side note, when a male is with a female he loves, his natural reaction is to avoid looking at other females so the female remains secure. This is the conclusion of a fairly recent study, no URL though. I may add it later.<br>  <br>  I will echo the "once a cheater always a cheater" comment though. If I found out a prospective girlfriend had cheated on any parter in the past, she would no longer be prospective. It is top of the list black mark.|`|8wHaLJzQaa	you sound a lot like my girlfriend, she used to be  HARDCORE player. I dont think i have ever seen someone that bad, time changed that and now were together monogamously.. (sp?) anyway she occasionally has a wandering eye, she has gotten better about it because she knows it makes me mad. IF Im so perfect for her why does she have to look is the main discussion of the wandering eye. to answer your question its normal but it will more than likely bother your girlfriend. As long as you have self control and you know you love your girlfriend it should not be dangerous JUSt becase of your past.|`|ZaIzN1Alaa	well you have the power to control your self so get it strait stop looking around and focus on your true love

dqZrq7Zeaa	Give him time. If someone else has raised him as their son, you have to realize that to your son all the emotion of "father" has been earned by another man.<br>  You sound hurt. And you have every right to be. If your son is old enough to say you're not his Dad, it sounds like you've been missing (no judgment intended). <br>  You have to give him time. Often in adoption re-unions it can be a few years from first contact until the first meeting.<br>  Stay with it. And best wishes.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If the child wants no contact you don't have the right to force it. The more respect you show your son now.. the more likely he will be to want to know you someday.|`|TzY9vkinaa	There's two kinds of dads.-- Someone who donated his sperm to create a child --Someone who raises the child and and is a father to them.|`|tRcO5uyiaa	It is just another reason that I decided never to be a parent. For some reason, I knew (at a very young age) that there would be far more negatives than positives about raising a kid. Turns out I was right.|`|7w9zXLGMaa	this isnt a laughing matter. a child will be left emotionally scarred without a parent.. you and the sons mom should work things out for the kid. at least TRY :D|`|GchuqcCaaa	I will never torture my kid or throw him into a place of torture, but that is just me.
kSSOniW2aa	race is not an issue with me.people are people|`|IkWRXHGXaa	I thank it is because people get some type of enjoyment out of coursing drama and problems in others lives and race is one of many topics they can use to do that.<br>  <br>  As long as they are people will to fighting, arguing & get up-set over race (fueling the posters enjoyment) then they will be people willing post about race.|`|i2FRvkEpaa	You're right. It's mostly an American thing, meaning the melting pot still has some very unresolved isues to work on.|`|fjsczTsMaa	In America, perhaps.

YT1vOwq6aa	ask your friends to see if he is even looking at you in the first place.<br>  If he is, he might like you, but is shy.<br>  If he is NOT looking at you, maybe he's not interested in you or doesn't want to talk to you.|`|hOC1Wrbhaa	he's doing this because he likes you...flash him|`|5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	Just move on.

AA11307468	I see three valid reasons to hit another person (not just a woman, but a man too):<br>  <br>  1.  Self-defense/defending a person unable to defend themself<br>  2.  Sports like boxing or martial arts<br>  3.  In the context of a BDSM-like relationship, where the hitting is consensual.|`|AA11312653	I believe the law says that if you have an option of running away, hiding, calling for help, or otherwise keeping yourself from being injured by some means other than mounting a counter assault, then you are required to use these less aggressive means. "She was after me with a knife" does not excuse hitting the attacker unless there are no other means of avoiding her attack. My guess would be that same principle applies to protecting others from attack.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Actually, the thing to do is to take the sharp weapon away from her.<br>  If hitting her is the only way to do it, then so be it, its in "self defense."|`|VMY7No0eaa	protect yourself<br>  protect your children / elderly|`|AA10782769	In a situation such as you've described you are justified to hit a woman provided that is the amount of force needed to stop her.  Further more you're justified to use deadly force if necessary to stop the attacker and or prevent her from completing the act.  In other words what sex she is has nothing to do with it.  However you better make sure you have all your ducks in a row and are able to prove that the amount of force used   ( particularly if you've had to use deadly force ) was necessary.  But then again that's the case whether it's a woman or a man.|`|1MUJBiYRaa	I believe so yes. If she is going to harm someone you know / love. It is immoral not to do something about it. I feel that if you didn't have time to call the police; then yes. But if it was predetermined or you have time to call them; no. If she attacks you - then it is legal to protect yourself.|`|afsAAunIaa	As a human being it is your responsibility to defend yourself and your family from any threats. At that point she isnt a "woman" but a viable threat to your safety and you have to act accordingly!!|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Self defense is self defense no matter what gender you are. <br>  <br>  However there is a difference in stopping someone from hurting you and continue beating them when they are down.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Yes, it's self defence or protecting another.|`|PuQyYMM8aa	yes... that is called defense|`|MHzNI9Yvaa	i would think so.<br>  oh geez, sounds scarry.|`|f0a32e61345899913bee88cf33014f9daa	ha, of course.|`|GpR5MI5raa	yes. he should punch her in the face......really hard.|`|HTCwqbqXaa	Self defense is always okay. I would encourage you to defend yourself. Try not to injure the other person, as laws will bite you on that. So many people talk and stories get mixed up. Be careful as to not make it look you are guilty, and make sure you are okay. If it is defending another person, it is heroic to help them. Do everything you can. <br>  <br>  I am anti-violence, but when it comes to self defense, everyone, regardless of gender should have that right. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck with your situation, or whoever's situation this is.|`|7daf4704b08ca820cff1d5030d2880b6aa	all you have to do is ask if its ok to hit a man in that or any situation. if your answer yes then equality dictates that it should be ok to hit a woman then too. If not it creates an unfair double standard|`|cW7xfPqUaa	he should preobably not hit her but hold her bak in some way. a guy should never hit a woman!|`|wXx0tMxnaa	omg yessssssssfor any other reason then what you just sed than nooo...|`|hLohtlPEaa	I'm not sure hitting is the only alternative. Trying to remove the sharp weapon from her grasp and guarding the elderly/disabled while you call 911 sounds more reasonable.

xWi4ua0Iaa	All I can say to your "Additional Details" is it's your account...you need to think about what stops a person from persecuting you, and if those rules apply here in R&S (they don't, I assure you that the anonymity provided trumps all bets)...your friends will still be able to read your questions - your enemies will be reduced to trying to delete your account one question at a time, which - since you are not violating rules any way - will be fairly easy to protect through the Appeals Process.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question - many Christians do not have a fundamentalists approach to the Bible - R&S seems to be overgrown with a lot that do, mostly because they cannot stand to be ridiculed and laughed at in the world away from their avatar, so they come here and continue their deluded "goddidit" nonsense from the security of a computer chair.  The silent majority of Christians understand these to be interesting stories with (hopefully) a decent moral they can apply to their lives.  The reason they are so silent is because there are too many (and 1 is "too many") of their fellow Christians willing and anxious to prove how much "better" a Christian they are by embracing this claptrap in a literal way, as if "God" would somehow demand that a person pretend to believe something that they find ridiculous.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	It doesnt.

They can still develop behavioral issues due to extreme emotions same as humans. Watch the dog whisperer, a lot of those dogs end up that way from losing another pet.

Society tends to shrug it off like they weren't a real family member.<br>  <br>  Anyone who says animals don't have emotions is a moron who has never met one.<br>  <br>  So sorry.  My heart goes out to you and yours.|`|AA11690436	Anyone who has spent anytime around pets or other animals knows they have emotions.  As well as looking to our own domesticated animals, read accounts of whales that have been saved or dolphin rescues (dolphins rescuing humans).  However, assuming that these emotions are exact analogs to human emotions can be a mistake that, in rare instances, lead to tragedies.  The account of the chimpanzee whose human had given anti-depressants springs to mind.<br>  <br>  With dogs, in particular, we've shared a partnership that spans back tens of thousands of years.  I rather think they domesticated us as much as we domesticated them.  And they learn many words in our language, while we seldom bother to learn the differences in their various vocalizations.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry for your loss.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	They have emotions, they just aren't the same as ours. My cat always gets excited to see me, but I realize that she can't love me like a person does.

It was so sad to see, she would perk up at anything she heard and then put her head down looking sad when her friend wasn't there.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss.|`|mSFjbetxaa	People who do not love animals have something wrong with them.  I would never trust a person who would not want to share their home with a pet.<br>  <br>  I had a cat for 17 years.

I suppose its a humanly thing to have too much pride. But Im glad people are in more of an understanding. I love animals.|`|ZUL3drNgaa	I don't understand people like that. Of course they do. People can just be too snobby to believe that any other species has intelligent qualities. It's like saying that another particular race doesn't have emotions! God put animals on this earth for the very same reason he put us here - to live and enjoy life and to make a positive difference. It's arrogant to think that they don't. When my kitten died, her sisters were sniffing around where she would sleep all the time, and they were just so sad for a while. It was heartbreaking.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	My dog got really depressed when my husband moved in with me....He gets happy when he sees me.....and I am sure it goes for most animals....I don't know who would make a comment like that...prob. somebody that doesn't own a pet.

xWi4ua0Iaa	When you hear the voice of God, then I would say you have a reason not to question it.  Until then, you may want to consider what you would accept as evidence as the voice of God, and realize that a 2000 year old book suspiciously used over the millenium to silence dissention doesn't meet the criteria for everybody.<br>  <br>  What Jesus "said" is lost to history - what we are TOLD Jesus "said" is going to carry the party line.  How would you like it if 30 years after you're dead people put words in your mouth?<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  --Yes, you are correct, as it is stated firmly on my profile, too.  I assume you are, but you certainly seem to spend a lot of time attacking other versions of the faith, so I guess I could be wrong.<br>  <br>  Having "faith" in Jesus is precluded by having "faith" that what you are told BY MEN is true in the first place.  A lot of folks skip that bit of logic in their rush to meet the rapture boat, don't they?  Fear is a great motivator.  Yell "fire" in a crowded theater and see how many run for the door without looking for evidence.  Then see how many are crushed in the responding panic.  That is what I think of your "religion".  Convince me otherwise.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	Jesus questioned God.  "Why have you forsaken me?"<br>  <br>  I see in the OT that the Psalms is full of questions to God, but also backed by trust and faith to God.   Sara even laughed at God.  <br>  <br>  I believe God invites us into conversation with him; to get to know him more intimately.  We should question, wrestle and haggle until we understand and find the answers we seek.  But we should do so in a respectful and open hearted way.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	I'd agree with you a little though, Abraham DID question God on a few occasions. namely about sodom and gemorrah. And it didnt kill him. Yes, he knew God COULD get mad, but guess what God didn't. So when paul says don't do it, he's ALMOST right. paul had alot of flaws in his teachings. You shouldn't question God, but if you do, nothing horribly bad will happen. God opts not to damn you to hell for it. Jesus I assume will say the same|`|LQsh261waa	You ask questions like his Apostles did but ones from an unbelieving heart are rejected."Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things?or who is he who gave ye this authority?" And he answered and said unto them," I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: The baptism of John, was it from Heaven, or from men"?And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.And Jesus said unto them, "Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things". Luke 20:2,7 kjv|`|MeFeazFiaa	Jesus never said anything because Jesus simply never existed.  He is the creation of humans in the same way humans created other gods like Zeus, Allah and  Jupiter.<br>  <br>  So don't waste your precious time on earth bothering about a bronze age work of fiction.  There is no heaven and no hell.  Just life as we know it now.  Make the best of it.
lTx8Hoheaa	This is one thing I think the Catholics might have wrong. It's pretty clear that Jesus had brothers, but it doesn't really affect my faith at all, so I don't really worry about it too much|`|lNtwpzpOaa	There are many reasons throughout the Bible that points out that Jesus was an only child and that Joseph had already passed on, leaving Mary alone. <br>  <br>  A couple are:<br>  <br>  --Jesus gave Mary to John. This would've been unacceptable and against the law according to the Jewish faith as her other children would've taken her in. <br>  <br>  --Mary followed Jesus throughout his ministry. If there were other children, this would've been unacceptable. She would've had to stay home with, at least, the daughters.<br>  <br>  Next, for the Jews, there is no word for cousin, close friend or anything like that. Any close kin were considered brothers and sisters. There was no word for uncle, cousin, niece, nephew and so on. <br>  <br>  Yes, in the Greek there was a word for cousin, but this is a Jew and he uses Jewish terms, even if he is writing in another language. <br>  <br>  A good example of this is snow. For most people, there's only one word for snow and that's snow. It describes the stuff falling from the sky, but in Alaska, there are numerous words for snow and they have different meanings even though they are the same substance.<br>  <br>  For the Jews, there was only the words "brother" and "sister" for close kin, but the Greeks had many other words to describe family. <br>  <br>  Another example: In Africa, any man older than you that is not your brother is your uncle. Even if it's a brother-in-law, he's your uncle. That's the culture. There was a man who came to America from this place in Africa and even though he learned English and didn't even remember his native tongue anymore, he still referred to the elder men in his family as uncle because that is what he knew.<br>  <br>  Even as the Jews began speaking Greek, they still referred to each other in words they knew: Brother, sister. <br>  <br>  Josephus was a Historian during the time preceeding after Christ and he remained a Jew, thus he used Jewish terminology.|`|ybFg4umCaa	It was a forgery produced by a medieval monk trying to provide some evidence of jesus. He obviously recognised that there was a lack of credible evidence and decided to produce some of his own|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Because 'brother" was a word used for any close relation, kin or even friends. It doesn't mean blood sibling.|`|OLiH8pSvaa	You're asking catholics a question and hoping for a knowledgeable answer? lol.|`|uK3tkaOJaa	Do you know that Catholic monks were in charge of translating Josephus for a few hundred years?  Have you ever looked into anybody, even Christians, real scholarly work on Josephus?  Huge portions are insertions by Catholic monks.<br>  <br>  Gawd, I'm trying to help you but it's frustrating to answer your quasi-intellectual questions when you are so clueless.  You don't know anything about history where this is concerned.  Or the fact the Jews don't have monks.  You don't know how history was handed down, who controlled knowledge for 1000 years.  You don't know about the council of Nicea.  Yesterday you quoted something from the Apostles Creed and asked "then why is this in the bible?"  It's NOT!  It's in the Apostles Creed, which was made up by the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  And it gets old trying to constantly fill you in on how uninformed you are. It's why I answer about 1/10 of your questions.  I think I'm going to answer less than that now.  It's too sad and frustrating.|`|OywIJxobaa	I don't know what you Christians believe, but isn't it a shame that when Jesus was dying on the cross, he asked John to take care of his mother? why didn't he ask his brothers to do that instead?<br>  <br>  and by the way, good luck with your obsession with this Paul character.|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	Do some research into the heretic "helvidius" and find out exactly how old your heresy is. I also find it interesting that a Sola Scripturist would pull from Josephus to support his error.

9Ur1VL9Paa	It's the complete opposite actually; maybe your friend should try and back up what she is saying. Anyone who has unprotected sex can get aids. There is too much awareness on the dangers of unprotected sex for most people regardless of their gender to allow themselves to get aids.|`|spbqfjvbaa	Myth.<br>  <br>  In the 80s, that may have been true.  Nowadays, the population with the highest AIDS rates are heterosexuals, especially women of color.  Blame the men for that one-unprotected sex kills.|`|RvddYKqjaa	I was working with a group that supported homosexuals, and at that time we were losing at least one man each week. I know at least ten personally who died during that period of time. No one took the time to see that some heterosexuals had to too, and many were from other countries. Since that time, the gay community is really serious about getting rid of those stereotypes. They use every precaution available to them, and the statistics are getting much better. So, at one time, it was not a myth at all. Awareness has changed all of that.|`|hyYWX82Eaa	Initially this was sort of true because anal sex was seen as risk free, and frankly the gay culture of the time encouraged unprotected hookups. Nowadays we're all older and wiser, but this stereotype is still floating around doing damage.

IMENWksEaa	The fulfillment of Bible prophecies that we have been seeing during our lifetime.They are all accurate. The past fulfillment of prophecies also. The positive and beneficial ways that the Bible has had in my life personally. I remember how I was and how I felt before gaining Bible knowledge. If I would have rejected that valuable knowledge, I would have lost instead of gained so much. I could've decided that I didn't want to learn, and now I would have been worried about the future, my family probably would not have been together, I could have made many problems for everyone, myself mostly, and been not a very contented individual. But since I made the best choice, to learn about Jehovah, and love him, and his Son Christ Jesus, apply the Bible in my life, even though I'm imperfect and make mistakes, I'm happy and a much better person to live with. Jehovah has been my helper, friend, and life saver.|`|sVyH0jTiaa	I don't know if I read it right but I will go ahead answer it.<br>  There have been few evidenced about the Bible.<br>  What I don't understand people don't believe it if they knew they have proved that there is something under the red sea.<br>  I don't have enough room to explain to all this.<br>  But really, To me I have my own strongest evidence is that people can't created what Jehovah God has made.<br>  For an example: Men can build the houses, cars, bike, and oh boy it going take forever for me to tell all this. So my point is Can men make trees, grass , air , water? NO!<br>  There is one more thing I would like to answer it.<br>  Let go back in 6,000 years ago and tell me what do you see? Do they have school like we do now? Were all people very educated? So, now my point is we are much more intelligent than they are. So tell me how in the world can someone write Bible like this? NO, it was from Jehovah's words and those men listen to Jehovah and write it down.<br>  Also , Jehovah tells those men to write it down but they don't even know each others and different era also some of them are not written in same languages.<br>  Does that rang your bell?|`|BzrUWCsDaa	The bible itself?<br>  <br>  The most convincing for me is bible prophecy. Coming true in accurate detail. The prophecy about the fall of Babylon is one such example. Also, bible prophecy about the times we live in now.<br>  <br>  The next most convincing is that everything in the bible is for our benefit. When people disregard what God says it always ends up detrimental for them but if its followed they have a fulfilled happier life. Wouldn't we expect that from a guidebook from a loving God?|`|HItbioaMaa	The fact that 36 years ago I could read it and finally understand it.

Of course, also Job 26:7 and Isaiah 40:22, about the earth being sphere and hanging upon nothing.|`|lR6Ocjm1aa	Porcelan Vessel Is right.. Fulfillment of Prophecy...What Jehovah foretells comes to be.<br>  <br>  The Bible is also a book of prophecy. (2?Peter 1:20, 21) The word “prophecy” may immediately bring to your mind unfulfilled words of self-proclaimed prophets. But leave any preconceptions behind, and open your Bible to Daniel chapter 8. Here Daniel describes a vision of a struggle between a ram with two horns and a hairy he-goat with “a conspicuous horn.” The he-goat prevails, but its great horn is broken. In its place four horns come up. What does the vision mean? Daniel’s account continues: “The ram that you saw possessing the two horns stands for the kings of Media and Persia. And the hairy he-goat stands for the king of Greece; and as for the great horn that was between its eyes, it stands for the first king. And that one having been broken, so that there were four that finally stood up instead of it, there are four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up, but not with his power.”—Daniel 8:3-22.<br>  <br>   Was this prophecy fulfilled? The writing of the book of Daniel was completed in about 536?B.C.E. Macedonian King Alexander the Great, who was born 180 years later, in 356?B.C.E., conquered the Persian Empire. He was “the great horn” between the eyes of “the hairy he-goat.” According to the Jewish historian Josephus, upon entering Jerusalem before his victory over Persia, Alexander was shown the book of Daniel. He concluded that the words of Daniel’s prophecy that were pointed out to him referred to his own military campaign involving Persia. What is more, in textbooks on world history, you can read of the course that Alexander’s empire took after his death in 323?B.C.E. Four generals eventually took over his empire, and by 301?B.C.E., the ‘four horns’ that stood up instead of “the great horn” divided the domain into four sections. Once again, we have every reason to wonder, ‘How could a book so vividly and accurately foretell what would take place some 200 years later?’|`|JbCAxMVjaa	Oh, fulfilled prophecy for sure. The prophecies about Jesus alone are so detailed and accurate. I mean, the 70 weeks of years? The statue, beasts, and ram and he-goat? There's an abundance of proof to be found simply by examining history and comparing it to Bible prophecy! Not to mention the fulfillment of the prophecies about the last days.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	It remains to this day even through natural disasters and many world powers that tried to obliterate it from the face of the earth.<br>  <br>  God is more powerful than Satan and the bible is our textbook on how to live and worship the Almighty God.

When they keep the commandments written in the bible, they are good people. Better however are people keeping the commandments of the Bible without knowing the Bible than people knowing the Bible but not keeping the commandments of the Bible. When they are led by their conscience, that is more than many people do.

Does this mean we will not continue to sin? No, however we need to be "falling forward" intent on pursuing righteousness(selflessness), and God is patient with us and quick to forgive as long as we repent.  I can not save you online, only God can save you, and He must choose you first, and then you Him, and if you accept your fate lies in Christ's hands and invite the Holy Spirit into your life and person, you will begin your walk to eternity.  God Willing this finds you open to the "Gospel" which you have just been exposed to.  Remember Pray(Matt.6), Listen, Act on what is told to you, find a church(one that feels right), resist temptation to the best of your ability, and when that doesn't work give your burden to God, he will take it away over a time(have patience) .  Start helping others in any way you can without accepting the praise they will attempt to give you, instead do it in the name of Christ, and send all of their praise to Him.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	In my eyes, you are a more intelligent person for not believing in a "God".|`|FG9fIQL3aa	Stupid isn't it!

If He does not answer yours it must be because you show such hate towards Him.|`|4M6RSigmaa	I do not class myself as religous but when something is going wrong i pray, it gives me hope and i believe that this is what christians believe, they believe that by asking God for help and praying in general maybe their situation will get better. I don't think it is right for you to say praying is pointless it means a lot to a lot of people. No matter what religion you belong to you pray in some form, you dont do it for instant help you do it for guidance and to make your self feel better.Also, it is part of religion, traditions and culture. I am not speaking on behalf of Christians or on behalf of any other religions but as a 19 year old who has friends of different faiths this is the conclusion i have come to.|`|4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa	To insist that God must conform to your childish views of Him reflects not on Him but you.<br>  <br>  Even in human affairs for example, husbands and wives share secrets and an intimacy that others are not privy to and which is simply beyond the knowledge of those outside.<br>  <br>  That you loudly testify that you are outside, makes you a laughing stock when you insist you know that such intimacies are pointless.<br>  <br>  <br>  O Atheist font of all Bible knowledge perhaps you might explain why the Bible is metaphorical and doesn't talk to someone?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. <br>  And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: <br>  For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.|`|f7JIqk5Raa	So...there was actually a test to track every single person's prayers, reflections, and outcomes in their life and the correlation with that prayer? I didn't see that study in the news.lol :) A number of tests...is rather vague, and honestly can hold no ground. Secondly, how do we know that God DOESN'T respond? Or perhaps we simply dismiss his response bc it happened to not be the one we wanted (but in the longrun was the one we needed.) Thirdly praying is never pointless. And I find it curious how such a devout athiest voicing the importance of freedom of belief (or should I say disbelief) is so eager to attempt to "shake" the faith of believers..kind of going against that purpose. Look, it's your decision to believe or not and as a Christian, I respect that and will not try to force my belief on you.

Give me a frickin' break!  Perhaps by placing electrodes on certain parts of the brain, we can "snap" believers into reality!  There is no supernatural and only death is "after life".  We only have one life, so make it worthwhile and meaningful.  Help pave the way for the future of our species!  Free your mind and let your brain evolve!=)|`|Vw1REpBKaa	Science will only ever discover more science. If a higher power/being is discovered, then that will become science not religion.

TzY9vkinaa	"Wearing the Temple Garment<br>  <br>  Once people are endowed, they have the blessing of wearing the temple garment throughout their lives. They are obligated to wear it according to the instructions given in the endowment. Those who have been endowed in the temple must remember that the blessings that are related to this sacred privilege depend on their worthiness and their faithfulness in keeping temple covenants.<br>  <br>  The garment provides a constant reminder of the covenants made in the temple. The garment should be treated with respect at all times. It should not be exposed to the view of those who do not understand its significance, and it should not be adjusted to accommodate different styles of clothing. When worn properly, the garment provides protection against temptation and evil. Wearing the garment is an outward expression of an inward commitment to follow the Savior."<br>  <br>  So basically it's a religious piece of clothing. Many religious have some sort of religious clothing.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	The point is to make the members feel above other Christian faiths.

I felt sorrow for his family, who ended up losing him to suicide.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	No. In reality most people who wear christianity on their sleeve are pro-death penalty and seek revenge.

I would be outraged, and I would certainly not feel sorry for Schmidt. Recall that Jesus did not feel sorry for the Temple businessmen who were turning God's house into a market; he ran them out with a whip. The crime of murder is orders of magnitude worse.  I would be praising God for creating a larger world in which there is justice for those who murder young girls, either in this world or the next.<br>  <br>  It is not the case that there is something "missing in Schmidt’s life that allegedly led him to commit such a horrible act."  The decision to murder is a free moral act, not mitigated by anything missing except a relationship with God that Schmidt clearly rejected.<br>  <br>  As a Catholic, I believe God created justice, and that one way or another, justice will be done. If Schmidt committed the crime, he should be put to death, thus saving the lives of 15-18 potential murder victims whose deaths will be deterred by the application of the death penalty (see link below). Too, execution might help Schmidt rethink his rebellion against God.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|D9lMg7A2aa	It is lovely and beautiful that he doesn't want to torture the bastard, yes, I agree. <br>  <br>  The guy ruined a whole bunch of people.

My prayers go with him, his family, his daughter, the man who killed her, and his family.<br>  Pax Christi
ZYCRkgawaa	Yes try the whistle. If that does not work you HAVE to talk to them. You could record the dog and let them have the tape so they will know you are not making it up. <br>  <br>  I have a neighbor whose dog was probably 500 feet from my house and I could hear it bark through closed windows and doors through my chimney. I timed its barking and it barked nearly every second for 5 hours. It may have barked longer but I finally fell asleep exhausted. 5 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds/minute equals 18,000 barks. I don't know how the dog was able to do it. <br>  <br>  I put an anonymous note on their door. They were away for the weekend. I haven't had a problem since, but I was close to letting the dog out of the yard in hope it would run away. <br>  <br>  You do not deserve to live this way and neither do your other neighbors.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I had a dog whistle, that worked on the dog downstairs. That dog would bark for an hour every time they went to to work in the morning (at 5:30AM). <br>  <br>  When I blew the whistle, the dog would stop barking, and every time it started again, I blew the whistle again. A human couldn't hear the whistle, and it actually irritated the dogs ear and he stopped barking whenever they hear it.<br>  <br>  But, if you want to keep your friends, you gotta walk on eggs when it comes to dogs and kids.|`|f0a32e61345899913bee88cf33014f9daa	maybe put an annonymous letter on their door when they're not home?  i dunno. if you are too scared to say something then it won't get resolved.|`|79632f5cafa59cc02272fe8777999b37aa	hahaha! My neighbours have a little black poodle. One time it barked for a straight hour while i was trying to nap before my second job.<br>  They were home too. Just letting it bark. sometimes it would bark at three in the morning.<br>  So me and my partner rang noise control (the animal branch) every single time it barked. Its confidential. I put the number by the phone and even if it was three in the morning we rang.<br>  Its inconsiderate to let your dog bark. Sure if someone comes over but thats it. Other people don't have dogs so they should not have to listen to yours.<br>  Over time they learnt to control their dog. For us it was kinda like training a dog too, teaching our neighbours how to live amoungst other people. <br>  You should do the same :]|`|cRdeb0T1aa	my sister found a thing for dogs, it's a small device that emits a very high pitched whine when dogs bark.  Humans can't hear it, (unless it's by your ear), and dogs hate it.  <br>  <br>  This got her dogs to stop barking.  I would put one by the fence, so whenever they are out there barking, it will go off, and irritate them, but she won't know what you are doing.  <br>  <br>  It's set off by barking, and sound, so it'll just sit there quietly when the dogs are behaving.<br>  <br>  She found it at walmart

P544Sbmqaa	You are living in a fantasy land.  Beauty has ALWAYS been judged by physcial appearance, for all of humanity.  The criterion has changed over time and always will change.  However, that doesnt mean that they didnt judge beauty by physical appearance.<br>  <br>  You could move to rural areas to get a slower pace of life.  They DO exist.  However, once again you are living in a fantasy land.  The issues may have been different ones during those times, but they still had their own issues.<br>  <br>  On top of that, the time periods you are talking about hosted a depression and war, at least in America.  There was a lot of political unrest and fighting over liberal rights and racism issues.  <br>  <br>  And you can always buy oldies music if you wanted.

If you love her and she loves you, nothing should stop you girls form marrying. I believe that you shouldn't be with her. She is practical saying that she is just wasting your time.

olzaIIs3aa	I think it should be legalized for various reasons.<br>  <br>  1. it would help our economy.<br>  i have read articles stating that marijuana would bring in an estimated $2billion per year in taxes - which could be applied to that national debt mr. bush accumulated for us.<br>  not only that but how many stoners get stoned and then stumble out to the stores to buy munchies?  how many of you delivered food to these people?  WE ARE KEEPING THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN BUSINESS.  You really think all of those people loitering around taco bell at midnight are sober?  guess again.<br>  <br>  2. it would clean out our jails<br>  think about the number of people we're paying for in taxes to be housed by our jail systems simply because of ... marijuana?<br>  <br>  3. it has been SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN that it is NOT HARMFUL.<br>  Yes, as stated below, people are sometimes allergic to it, but then there are also people allergic to nuts yet you find those suckers EVERYWHERE.  (why does my gum say it may contain nut products? seriously people, i know those things aren't chewy!)<br>  <br>  4. people who smoke ... are chill.<br>  we don't fight - because we're high! who wants to fight when you're high?  we're happy - because we're high!  we don't steal - because it's not addictive! i'm not going to take your toaster so i can go buy a dime bag.  I'll just wait for my paycheck - or flip through my couch.<br>  we're awesome workers - we can just zone out and get things done.<br>  oh and by the way WE ARE HAPPY.<br>  <br>  Now here are some reasons why people think it should not be legal:<br>  <br>  1. marijuana is bad for you<br>  Here's is what i've found on this issue:<br>  "Smoking of cannabis is the most harmful method of consumption, since the combination of inhalation of smoke from organic materials such as tobacco, wood, gasoline and cannabis can cause various health problems." - wikipedia<br>  is that it?  yea - that's pretty much it.<br>  now what's funny is that wikipedia also posted a chart showing <br>  how different substances are harmful to you.<br>  What substances do you think rate as more harmful than weed?<br>  tobacco and alcohol.<br>  (side note: E and LSD also rate as having a lower dependence and physical harm rate than tobacco and alcohol).<br>  And you think smoking should be illegal? whatever dude.  people do **** that's bad for them all the time, are we going to go around shutting down mcdonalds? no? why? those disgusting burgers are TERRIBLE for you.  there's even a documentary about that. so shut up)<br>  <br>  let's take a look at what dr. lester grinspoon says about this:<br>  <br>  "I began my study of marijuana in 1967 because I was concerned that young people were harming themselves by ignoring authorities’ warnings about a dangerous drug. I had hoped to write a paper that would definitively establish a scientific basis for this concern, and publish it in a widely read medium.<br>  <br>  It was not long before I realized that despite my training in science and medicine, I had, like almost every other citizen of this country, been brainwashed by the United States government into believing that cannabis is a terribly dangerous drug. By 1971, the year Harvard University Press published Marihuana Reconsidered, I knew that, far more harmful than any inherent psychopharmacological property of this substance, was the way we as a society were dealing with its use. While marijuana is, in fact, remarkably free of toxicity, the consequences of annually arresting 300,000 mostly young people were not. Once I grasped the absurdity of this prohibition, I became devoted to the cause of changing these laws. "<br>  <br>  i think that sums things up pretty well right there,<br>  but i also want to add this:<br>  <br>  "why would someone want to do something that's bad for them?"<br>  <br>  well ...<br>  <br>  why am i 26 years old and still having to hide the fact that i like to smoke weed?  seriously people.  I'm 26!  i think i've earned the right to decide what i do and do not want in my body.  <br>  <br>  now ...<br>  <br>  let's take a look at some LEGAL drugs:<br>  <br>  . caffeine (coffee, energy drinks energy shots - you name it)<br>   yea, because that's GREAT for your body.<br>  let's go down some nuclear waste (which is by the way - just as addictive as pot, even more so in my opinion as you become PHYSICALLY ADDICTED to energy drinks.  Yes kids, that's right!  <br>  Why else do you think your headache goes away when you drink your favorite caffeinated beverage?)<br>  <br>  . Kratom - a medical leaf harvested from a tree in south asia. "Very good first choice for anyone interested in ingesting legal substances for psychoactive purposes. It can produce euphoria as well as reduce anxiety, depression, and pain. Should not be consumed daily because it may be habit forming." <br>  <br>  . Kava - a crop from the west pacific. used as a tranquilizer.<br>  Wikipedia states: "Safety concerns have been raised over liver toxicity".<br>  <br>  . Betel Nut - reduces appetite and calms nerves.  <br>  Certain studies have sought to prove that regular chewers of betel quid have a higher risk of damaging their gums and acquiring cancer of the mouth, pharynx, o|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	I don't think any form of drug should be legalised (unless it is used for medical reasons). And when I say for medical reasons; only doctors should be permitted to to distribute the medication.<br>  <br>  I don't even thing tobacco should be legal. Why legalise something that will kill your brain cells; doesn't make sense I'm afraid!|`|cSaVqUDdaa	Hell yeah in a heart beat! lol<br>  <br>  im all for legalizing marijuana<br>  its harmless better than the rest of<br>  that bullshit they have on the streets|`|Uv6A5eNHaa	i dont think they will. but they sould.|`|FpMS47sXaa	I look at the facts.<br>  <br>  1. No one has EVER died from pot.<br>  2. Pot does have negative health aspects, but no more than smoking.<br>  3. Pot does not makes people commit crimes.<br>  4. Pot is all natural.<br>  5. Pot CAN be and IS beneficial to those with medical conditions.<br>  <br>  With that being said, I would vote YES.<br>  <br>  The Gov is finally looking at it the way in which they should. It is a potential cash crop for the gov. Regulate it. Sell it ONLY in certain places - ie drug stores. Use a national listing of users, like they do with sinus medication. And, most importantly, tax the hell out of it.

YyEEAJBkaa	Yes, they would probaly pee their pants if it did though.|`|pakIAYWoaa	Im a Christian who sees the condition of the world as society including much of the church has rejected the love and holiness of God for humanist and materialist principals.  The end times describes the times of the end as terrible but on the other side is the glorious kingdom age of Christ.  I do not wish anyone to go throught the tribulation but it is knocking at the door.  This April the G 20 summit is preparing the platform for world government.  The economic crisis is th tool that will usher in this new age.  Christians wont be tolerated in this society.  I share the love of Christ with all but this world sucks right now because Gods influence has been rejected.  The day of the Lord will be terrible bt i think many don;t want to endure the hardships that are coming as the prelude to all end times events transpiring.  In a sense like a dentist appointment nobody really looks forward to it, we would already rather be done with it..|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Not all Christians say that.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	You thought wrong.

That book is interpreted by most people wrong. It is about Nero Caesar. The book of revelations is not about the world ending and a devil baby and so on. Try a book on preterist. Another thing that most christians have wrong is this.<br>  <br>  In the NT Paul said that he has preached to the whole world yet he did not ever actually preach to the whole world. To Paul the whole world was the Roman Empire and surrounding area.<br>  <br>  So in the OT in Genesis when Noah says the whole earth was flooded he meant just the area they lived in. And the earth is not 10 thousand something years old. They are again misreading the genealogy as individually expressed instead of  heritage compressed.|`|DBg0yFSYaa	I used to hear that amoung the JWs when I was a kid. I was raised in that religion.

Some people find joy anyway, but some don't.|`|tOWqXCdtaa	The reason we want the end to come is because we know that when Jesus returns (and Jesus IS love) there will be paradise for us. You have no hope so it doesn't make sense to you. But you don't realize that Jesus IS the hope you need. If you lived in a third world country, but were still managing to survive ok, would you want that country destroyed, not believing there was anything better out there? If you didn't believe there was anything better out there, you would be happy with what you had. But if you knew that what you had was crap compared to what you COULD have, but that crap had to first be destroyed, would you be ok with that then?|`|9btru19waa	When it ends there will be no more chances for the lost.

U8Fwh38jaa	Being a witch means being part fairy?  AND you're part vamp and now want to be a were-bird?  And I'm sure you mean in the literal sense, not in the astral sense as others have suggested.   While I believe in magic and all that goes with it, you're simply unrealistic.  Your ideas are all over the place and don't seem to have any real basis on any belief system or any realistic viewpoint whatsoever.  There is no combo of witch and fairy.  The two are not interchangeable and you cannot be "part" fairy or "part witch."  You either are or you're not.  As for being vamp, give me a break.  How exactly were you born a vamp??    Just because you say you're a thing doesn't make it true.   Your aunt may be Wiccan, but I sure hope it's not her that's teaching you all this nonsense, because that's not what Wicca is all about.<br>  <br>  People like you with such ridiculous ideas are what prejudices others against Wicca and other pagan beliefs including witchcraft.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	Since physical shape shifting is impossible, come on, there's not way someones physical body would survive something like that.<br>  It is however possible to shift the shape of your Astral self into an animal, or even shifting the "feel" of your Aura into something else.

Of course you don't literally change your physical being into that of a cat but you change your consciousness to the point where you take on the attributes you perceive are cat-like. If your powers are great, as far as you're concerned (and anyone else that meets you whilst you are shape-shifted) you are more catlike than human.<br>  <br>  This spell will help you 'shape shift' into the different roles you need to play in school. Notice I said 'different roles'! As drama is your favourite subject and your desire is to be an actress, you are now going to 'act' in all your classes.<br>  <br>  For this spell you will need:<br>  <br>  1 white feather (transformation)<br>  peppermint oil (transformation)<br>  green candle (new energies)<br>  <br>  Every morning before you go to school rub a few drops of the peppermint oil into the candle and light. Gaze at the flame holding the white feather in your hands as you say:<br>  <br>  "I transform, I adapt<br>  The power's mine<br>  I can act<br>  Brilliantly in every role<br>  That is required to be whole"<br>  <br>  Say this three times really focusing on the power of the words fuelled further by the element of fire and the intensity of the transformative essence of the oil.<br>  <br>  You now need to strongly visualise 'acting' in every class. When you are in Maths class you are researching for the role of a mathematician that you need to be able to play convincingly for an upcoming movie role.<br>  <br>  In science when you need to report on an experiment, picture cameras on you recording your brilliant performance as a budding scientist.<br>  <br>  Embrace every role you need to play in school with the same passion you embrace your actual drama classes. The greatest preparation for a successful actress is to live every experience in life to the fullest, so that you have a rich background to draw on when making your characters convincing.<br>  <br>  After visualising your day at school for a few minutes, snuff the candle and say "So Mote It Be". <br>  <br>  Place the feather next to the candle (maybe anchor it with a clear quartz crystal so that it doesn't blow away). <br>  <br>  Repeat the spell every morning for a minimum of 21 days. If you desire, continue with the spell indefinitely, replacing the candle after each group of 21 days.|`|SV6imBp3aa	okay this is how you turn into a were-cat<br>  you get cat pee from a ginger cat (i dont know why and what but something because of their colour amkes there pee unique. ooh they can't be dyed ginger either)<br>  then you drink the cat pee<br>  then you climb up a tree with your nails<br>  then when you jump down you should transform<br>  just dont go too high in the tree<br>  good luck|`|izXIAxXGaa	You can check folk lore under Wicca, witch craft or lycanthropy.

This refers to Satan. He doesn't want people to worship the true God. Centuries ago, false bible doctrines began to infiltrate the churches and religions, and these untruths continue down to this day. For example, the bible doesn't say "all good people go to heaven, or bad people go to hell." This is a false teaching. The bible says that homosexuality is wrong. Yet, many religions today teach that it's okay. The bible doesn't say Jesus died on a cross (he died on a stake), but many religions teach this. And unfortunately, people are so blinded that they can't see the truth.|`|N0Pplfsjaa	Have you seen Rush Hour? Where Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are fighting with the guns?

When we don't know our Bible, what it says, and its intended use Satan can flip it, toss it , do whatever to confuse us.<br>  <br>  In Matt Ch 4, Jesus is tempted by the Devil. Jesus uses scripture to ward the Devil off. In one instance the Devil challenges Jesus in "If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say, `He orders his angels to protect you. And they will hold you with their hands to keep you from striking your foot on a stone" <br>  <br>  Satan used the bible to try to get Jesus to jump from a cliff saying God's angels would protect him and Jesus counters saying ''The Scriptures also say, `Do not test the Lord your God'"<br>  <br>  You can have the most powerful drill in the world but if you don't know how it works you'll never get a hole ...<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped <br>  Take Care|`|xsCvFkKQaa	It just means that Satan has read the Bible and can try and twist it around.

But when I learned the truth, I realized I had broken the law and was a sinner, doomed to die.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:10 So the good law, which was supposed to show me the way of life, instead gave me the death penalty.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:11 Sin took advantage of the law and fooled me; it took the good law and used it to make me guilty of death.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:12 But still, the law itself is holy and right and good.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:13 But how can that be? Did the law, which is good, cause my doom? Of course not! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation. So we can see how terrible sin really is. It uses God's good commandment for its own evil purposes.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:14 The law is good, then. The trouble is not with the law but with me, because I am sold into slavery, with sin as my master.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:15 I don't understand myself at all, for I really want to do what is right, but I don't do it. Instead, I do the very thing I hate.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:16 I know perfectly well that what I am doing is wrong, and my bad conscience shows that I agree that the law is good.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:17 But I can't help myself, because it is sin inside me that makes me do these evil things.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:18 I know I am rotten through and through so far as my old sinful nature is concerned. No matter which way I turn, I can't make myself do right. I want to, but I can't.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:19 When I want to do good, I don't. And when I try not to do wrong, I do it anyway.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:20 But if I am doing what I don't want to do, I am not really the one doing it; the sin within me is doing it.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:21 It seems to be a fact of life that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:22 I love God's law with all my heart.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:23 But there is another law at work within me that is at war with my mind. This law wins the fight and makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:24 Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin? [fn]  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 7:25 Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God's law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin.<br>  <br>  Rom 8:1 So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 8:2 For the power [fn] of the life-giving Spirit has freed you [fn] through Christ Jesus from the power of sin that leads to death.|`|DI2VcAruaa	The fact that you feel guilty for hurting the Lord's  temple (your body), shows that His Spirit lives in you. You claim a love for God , and I believe you do. These are good signs. That something that tells you "If I really loved him, I would quit smoking. " is your conscience and or the spirit of God speaking to your heart. This is the truth , Do you love smoking more than God ? If so you need to examine your faith. If not you will quit, because smoking is a sin for you.  No you are trying as hard as you can you say. Are you really? You know and God knows . If you are this is also a good sign. Sister, I will pray for you. <br>  <br>  O Lord God of Israel , who keeps covenant and shows mercy to them that seek you with all their hearts , bow down thy ear and hear my prayer. Thy Servant Alisa says that she loves you, and that she wants to quit smoking. Lord please take away the desire for her to smoke. She is crying out to you O Lord for your help. Lord you said that if we ask anything in your name , that is in your will , that you will do it. Lord we know that quitting smoking is your will. We know that you can provide help for Alisa to quit. Please do so. Provide her with strength to not buy another cigarette and to destroy the ones she now has. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ . Amen.<br>  <br>  Now I have a few tips from an ex smoker,(me) . Get a jar put half a dozen or more smoked cig butts in the jar and cough up and  spit a few lungers into it , throw a little water or  beer in there  and let it get ripe. Everytime you feel the urge to smaoke take a whiff of it. Soon just looking at it will turn your stomach. The next time you see a friend who smokes ask him/her for a cigarette. When he/she gives it to you break it in half and throw it on the ground and stomp on it . They wont give you another. Get a photo of some smoker's black lung with  cancer, put it next to the jar of butts. Pray Pray Pray, Dont buy any more cigs .  Think Positive! you CAN do it. Yes you can!

Stop asking God to forgive you, because you are just in a rut.  Put it all in God's hands, recognize that you have an addiction and deal with it that way.  I quit smoking three months ago.  I knew it was terrible for me and set a bad example to others, but I really enjoyed it.  My workplace sponsored a Smoke-Out last November and I decided to make that date mine.  I knew I couldn't do it without help, so I asked my doctor for advice.  I got a Rx for Chantix, and it really worked.  It was still tough, but I had friends I had pledged to and I didn't want to fail.  I often had to ask God for help, but I stopped asking forgiveness.  <br>  <br>  You see, you are only torturing yourself.  God forgives when we ask and if we still are eaten up with guilt, we have a problem.  Praying a 1,000s of times a day?  Isn't that an obsession?  Is that how God wants you to live?

MnewrjTAaa	(1) Ask yourself what's really going on.  Is your child (a) generally mean to other children, or (b) is this an isolated instance, or (c) a case where your child is bullying a child that other kids also pick on (=follow-the-leader)?  <br>  <br>  (2) Re (a) above:  this is the worst situation.  Researchers say that bullies fall into two classes:<br>  (a) bullies who pick on other kids and have high self-esteem<br>  (b) children who have themselves been bullied and now pick on weaker children.  These kids have low self-esteem.<br>  <br>  (3) Now address the situation.  Ask other people for advice, but I'd suggest:  If it's (1a) you might have a real problem and you need to address it now, very strongly.  Tell your child that his behavior is mean and intolerable, that you're ashamed of him, and that if it happens again the punishment will be X.  (Whatever your punishment is.)  Then follow through, very strongly.<br>  <br>  Also:  ask yourself where your child learned this behavior.  Is he exposed to verbal abuse or other dehumanizing behavior in the home or other environment?  Does he watch movies that are too old for him?  Etc.  If there's something in his environment that needs to be changed, then work on it.<br>  <br>  If your child falls into (1a) and has emotional problems because he's been bullied, then he might need counseling to help him get things straight.<br>  <br>  If your child falls into (1b) then you probably just need to have a very serious talk with him.<br>  <br>  If it's (1c), you need to talk to your child and then step forward and do something about the problem.  Help the child who's being picked on.<br>  <br>  I'm a little concerned that you write "your children" are mean to others.  I don't know if this is just the way you're phrasing the question, or if you actually have several children who are bullies.  If that's the case, you might need outside help.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  From what I've seen, a good focussed grownup can do wonders with any problem a child has.<br>  ***<br>  Okay, just saw the edit.  It must be hard to be the gp and watch this go on.  Good luck.

Let them know it's a role-play and then YOU be the mean child to them over a pretend issue.  Afterwards, talk about how it made them feel.

Some people confuse this with punishment, but there are distinct differences.  Punishment enforces the concept that harsh conditions are imposed for being caught in doing poor behavior.  This may or may not improve the overall performance of the child in question.  <br>  <br>  Discipline on the other had teaches youth that proper use of self control and appropriate levels of restraint on poor impulses can yield rewards.  A common form of discipline that works with older children is the use of privileges.  The trick is starting children out with an understanding of what is a right, and what is a privilege in your family.<br>  <br>  For example by my thinking basic food, shelter, and essential clothing are rights.  However, things like TV, video games, desserts, phone use, internet access, and time with friends are privileges.  Privileges are earned through acceptable behavior, and lost through unacceptable behavior.  <br>  <br>  Since this is pretty much how it works in the adult world, it can be a good lesson to teach your children early.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	It's pretty natural for kids to be mean to each other.

What those consequences would be would depend on the circumstances and the age of my kids. Teasing another child about being poor for example, an appropriate consequence for an older kid might be having them work in a soup kitchen that weekend. A younger kid, I'd maybe have them select a couple of their nicer toys to donate to a shelter, and then we'd bring the toys down together so they could see first hand what being really poor is like. Of course I would also require that they apologise to the kid who was being picked on. <br>  <br>  I try to use natural consequences whenever possible, so that the connection is made between their behavior and the resulting disciplinary action.|`|de109ccf1349bcb7dcc5e78fb10fcbe6aa	find out why they are being mean. There has to be a root cause to their anger. Try to work with your child on sharing and showing affection instead of anger toward people - perhaps it is just a need to teach them to use their words to show emotion rather than physical actions. There are many books out there that can help you. If you cannot do it yourself, tell your pediatrician about the problem and perhaps seek professional help.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	I would recommend praying the rosary for them.  It is God's preferred means for obtaining the conversion of sinners.<br>  <br>  The rosary is explained here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles. She selected this title at Fatima: "I am the Lady of the Rosary."<br>  <br>  St. Francis de Sales said the greatest method of praying IS- Pray the Rosary.<br>  <br>  St. Thomas Aquinas preached 40 straight days in Rome, Italy on just the Hail Mary.<br>  <br>  St. John Vianney, patron of priests, was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand.<br>  <br>  "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI<br>  <br>  "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V<br>  <br>  Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The Rosary is THE WEAPON"<br>  <br>  Pope Leo XIII wrote 9 encyclicals on the rosary.<br>  <br>  Pope John XXIII spoke 38 times about Our Lady and the Rosary.

FOzN3xwzaa	Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's PERFECT salvation.  We are not under the law (Romans, Galatians, and Ephesians)|`|gOwakeM1aa	There is nothing you can do to get yourself saved. The Bible tells us that only God can save you. God performs the mighty miracle of salvation  through Jesus who died for the chosen and creates in them a new soul that now  loves God and can truly know he is saved.  The effect of this miracle of salvation on the saved person's life is that now he has an ongoing desire to do the will of God . He now is happiest when he is obeying God's law book, the Bible. Thus if you truly desire to become saved, you should spend much time carefully reading or listening to the Bible. "So then faith(Jesus) cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" Romans 10:17.|`|zXnyQx0iaa	What u do to be saved is ask the lord into your heart and ask him to take back your sins|`|AA11232725	Here's a link that gives a good answer to your question.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://contenderministries.org/romanroad.php" rel="nofollow">http://contenderministries.org/romanroad...</a><br>  <br>  The ROMANS ROAD....is a pathway you can walk.<br>  <br>   It is a group of Bible verses from the book of Romans in the New Testament.

Then you get baptized and you live your life as a new creation of God.|`|HZqi9XyJaa	The steps to salvation are:<br>  _________________<br>  <br>  1.

God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved.<br>  _________________<br>  <br>  2. CONFESS AND REPENT OF YOUR SINS. <br>  <br>  I John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>  _________________<br>  <br>  3. BE BORN AGAIN<br>  <br>  John 3:3,5 - Unless you are born again, you cannot enter the kingdom of God, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water.<br>  <br>  Mark 16:16 "He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not will be condemned".<br>  <br>  Romans 6:4 - For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead, now we may live new lives.<br>  __________________<br>  <br>  All of these steps are in Acts 2:38 "Each of you must repent, turn to God, and be baptized for the forgiveness of sin."

5N3odm3Qaa	That all Asians are smart. There are few words to comprehensively describe how much I disagree with this statement. I haven't met (m)any Asian students OR professionals who evoke feelings of envy from me.<br>  <br>  I think the stereotype that all Indians (and Middle-Easterners in general) are going to be doctors is absolutely ludicrous. The huge majority of Indians that I met were FAR from intelligent enough to handle the demands of medical school. The cheating that I see is outrageous. Especially in this day and age of PDAs, BlackBerrys, and Treos, cheating is so much more prevalent. It disgusts me to see people succeed with less effort than those of us who work our asses off to study and learn.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I get heated about this stuff.<br>  <br>  I also dislike the stereotype that black people are wildly unhinged and incapable of decorum.

KBBonf97aa	Most girls who claim to be bisexual are actually straight and either "dabbling" in same-sex relationships because it's currently fashionable or because they don't know that same-sex attractions during adolescence are normal, but temporary, and have nothing to do with their sexual orientation.  And most teenage boys who claim to be bisexual wind up realizing they're gay later.  That's why there are so many teenagers who identify as bisexual, but so few adults who don't identify as either straight or gay.<br>  <br>  Even if a girl has had sex with other girls, that doesn't make her bisexual.  Any person can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, male or female.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he has sex with a woman any more than a lesbian turns bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them.  But sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  Nobody gets to "decide" what it is.  That's why it's so silly when kids label themselves bisexual because it's fashionable.  In many cases, sexual orientation doesn't make itself clear until late adolescence or early adulthood, when hormones drop to normal levels.  When people "choose" an orientation before that happens, they're just speculating about something they can't possibly know.  And if bisexuality weren't considered cool, most kids wouldn't even consider sticking themselves with that label.<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are some true bisexuals, but there are far fewer of them than there are people claiming to be bisexual.  The vast majority of people are either straight or gay, and nobody can "become" a different sexual orientation.  If a straight girl decides to date another girl, she's still straight and if a gay man decides to date a woman, he's still gay.  Sexual orientation has nothing to do with sex acts.|`|msVBFJpwaa	No, I think you don't "become" anything.  You're born the way you are.

"Meditations" were cognitively active forms of prayer -- like reflecting on Scripture passages, analyzing the faculties of our mind/ heart/ soul, and visualizing scenes from the Bible. "Contemplation," on the other hand, is a form of prayer in which words, thoughts, and images are left behind, and the practitioner allows him or herself to come into a "naked, blind, feeling of being" and offers themselves up in that silence to the Source and Foundation of being -- very, very simple; very, very beautiful; very, very profound.<br>  .|`|5shqstYraa	Prayer would be to the Almighty, meditation would be within.

yrJQHOOeaa	I believe if you read my earlier response to this tragedy you will see that not ALL have different views than you. For people who are catholic, their opinions will mirror their religious beliefs. For those who are Atheists, they will see the church as useless and unnecessary... so they may just care that the girl got raped. The excommunication is important to some, less important to others. This is a story that received national attention. The real tragedy lies in all the children who are being raped and molested as you read this and THEIR stories are unknown. I cannot understand a pedophile because I lack their desires. I am fortunate in this way... but unfortunate that I cannot find compassion and forgiveness for someone who harms innocent children.<br>  I mirror your feelings of outrage, but would rather send out compassionate thoughts to the children who suffer in silence than fill our universe with hate for a molester I cannot understand and forgive. I can only hope one day to have achieved the highest state of mind, the highest level of unconditional compassion, and the purest form of bliss. <br>  Then I may be able to find the children who suffer and help them.|`|E9chZY74aa	How are two wrongs right?

Maybe she's a dim bulb. Or maybe he had them all living in fear. That's a very common thing with abusive so-called men.|`|g7wuTmA0aa	Excommunication is the most a church can do. The rest is left to the system. In the Old Testament, rapist and kidnappers were also lumped in with murderers. All of them got the death penalty. It's well deserved in most peoples opinion.<br>  <br>  Since though, the Church is not all powerful in this corrupt world of injustice, you can tell by the fact that the molestations went on for three years without notice, the Church can do little to exact proper justice against the evils of this world. Thank God it was caught in the first place, a lot of molestations are never caught.<br>  <br>  Excommunication is about the height of punishment that the church can give. Perhaps the Church has something MORE in store for the twisted father. Even so, he does deserve excommunication as well.<br>  <br>  What of the mother? Yes, the sin of indifference is equal to, or that much worse, then the crime she chose to ignore for 3 years. Punishment should also fall on her head with equil force, if she in fact, did know about the molestations. Hey, in some cases, the other parent really did not know or could not tell do to some reason or another. That though should be left for another time and posted question. Ask for the next time, How is it that some parents don't know the other is molesting their children? I would like to know more on that myself.<br>  <br>  The doctors, well, in some cases, yes, abortion is necessary, like the endangerment of the mothers life. Who should be the one who lives, the child or mother? In this brutal situation, the choice that is best is that the mother lives. More then likely if the mother's life is in danger then so is the child's, therefore both could die instead of one living. Should the doctors be excommunicated? Maybe, perhaps the Church looked into their records and found out they did more then just that abortion as well. Abortions that did not threation any life, it was just the discusting and worthless parent who did not want to take any responsibity or be tied down that chose to take her unborn childs life. Then you get the others who simply didn't want to have what ever sex that child was going to be so they just kill it before it was born so they can have the other. Perhaps the doctors got exposed for also doing these types of abortions as well, and this last one was the window that the church looked through and said, yeah, we might have tolorated the one, but not the rest. <br>  <br>  If its their first one? Well, what can I say, abortion is always a sad thing. Excamunication though, might be a little too far. Can you blame a man for haveing to choose between either saveing his wife or child from a burning building wile the other dies? It's a very heavy topic of debate.<br>  <br>  Who knows, I do believe some things should be givin to a second evaluation in the choices they, the Church, make.|`|gOF1wJLFaa	Of course the father did not get excommunicated for raping a child. Why would he?<br>  <br>  That's Standard Operating Procedure for Catholics.

RR|`|eDYXQxA9aa	I think for many people one issue is that the church is making loud noises about its concern for the sanctity of the lives of the aborted twins, while failing to understand that a 9 year old girl attempting to carry and deliver them was likely to result in all 3 dying. <br>  <br>  The 9 year old was alive and reasonably healthy. The "twins" were simply bundles of cells likely to bring her life to an end. By all means the church is welcome to criticise abortion, but in this case excommunicating the doctors rather than simply opposing it seems to go too far, particularly given the circumstances of the case, and the churchs particular history with child abuse. <br>  <br>  "compassion" it seems has gone out of vogue with the catholic church. Following the letter of the law does not excuse you from the need to demonstrate simple decency to all people, not just those you have self-appointed yourself to represent. What it looks like is simply grandstanding from the church to make their presence felt and remind everyone that "gods law is above human law"... which seems to apply no matter what god chooses to do to you in their eyes.<br>  <br>  In this case, god and the church can go shove it wherever they like. The mother and the doctors first priorty should have been the safety and life of the girl, and the decision they made was in that regard.

If someone here named their kid fat **** there might would be an issue yeah because social services would see that as child abuse and teachers would refuse to use it at schools but a name that's just different or made up is perfectly fine. There are lots of names here for instance that are changing gender connotations, Jordan, Spencer, Taylor, Charlie-they're becoming feminised and that's okay because language evolves and changes (it's supposed to) part of the evolving nature of language is making up new words and names for things. You can't bubble wrap kids from being taunted; it's just silly to try.

The one you're referring to is in Chapter 2, where God first  made Adam, then all the animals, and when no animal was a fit partner ("help-meet" in the King James version), God put Adam to sleep, took 'bone from his bone and flesh from his flesh' and made Eve.  One from dust, the other from rib, and both made alive by God's breath.<br>  <br>  In Chapter 1, on the other hand, God first makes all of the animals, then mankind ("ha'adom" in the original Hebrew), male and female at the same time, and both made in God's own Image.<br>  <br>  The writers who were inspired by the Holy Spirit to write the Book of Genesis were not trying to write a biology textbook.  Their purpose was to teach us that it was God who created us, whether out of nothingness, as in Chapter 1, or dust and a rib, in Chapter 2-- or by evolution for that matter (the order of creation in the first chapter of Genesis pretty much matches the order of creation in your biology text-- think the scientists stole the idea from the Bible?).<br>  <br>  Science can only teach us about "how".  Only faith can teach us "why", and "by Whom".

These 73 Books withstood 1100 years of scrutiny until the Reformation and the rise of Protestantism. This new movement saw a need to distance itself from Catholicism and what better way to do so, than to “amend” God’s Holy Word - which at the time, was considered to be a pillar of the Catholic faith. As a result, 7 Books were dropped from the Canon of Scripture. In addition, some parts of the Book of Daniel, were also omitted.<br>  <br>  Apocrypha means "hidden", not "wrong". If these books were blasphemous, the Israelites would have burned the books, not just hidden them away.<br>  <br>  And as for many answers above me, they have obviously never read these seven books, because these books do fit in with scripture.<br>  .|`|uK3tkaOJaa	There are 5 missing books.

It's true that they are not part of the Jewish Torah.  Early Jews (by early I mean the time of Christ and before) did not have a set list of scriptures.  They had many holy writings some of which made it into their final writings and some of which didn't.  There are various reasons why some books made it into the  bible and others didn't.  <br>  For those who claim that they contradict the rest of the bible, I'd like to state the original Protestants who made that decision saw these books as unnecessary because in addition to not being found in the original  hebrew, their important information could be found in the other books which the Protestants left in the bible.  Also, the Apocrypha says nothing about salvation through giving alms.  One book, Sirach, which scholars predict was written by a teacher of wealthy young men as a means of instruction, talks a great deal about giving alms, but doesn't say anything about that being a key to salvation.  Catholics believe salvation is achieved through a combination of belief and works.|`|laVGEEeraa	Years ago the people who compiled the Bible had all these scriptures and decided among other things to "canonize" the book.  What this meant is they had to determine what books to include and what books to leave out and then "seal" it with laws that prevent anyone from ever adding to it or removing books from it.  <br>  <br>  In the New Testament, they excluded any books that did not give reference to Jesus as a deity (in addition to being a man) or claimed that he was only a man.  They wanted to believe that he was God incarnate and did not want any books included that eluded to anything else. <br>  <br>  The Catholics however were not content with only worshiping Jesus and felt that the virgin Mary also was a force to be reckoned with.  Martin Luther disagreed and protested (protestant = someone who is protesting).<br>  <br>  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints are considered to be protestants but have inserted their book of Mormon into the Bible, so there are "some" protestant Bibles that have books that Catholic Bibles are "missing."|`|wxBFZ41Taa	In first century Jerusalem there were at least four OT Canons in use by different Jewish Groups. There was the Canon of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Ethiopian Jews and the Diaspora/Essene Jews. Jesus and the disciples used the Septuagint which was the Canon of the Diaspora/Essenes. We know this because it is quoted in the New Testament. This Canon continued to be the Canon of Christians until after the Reformation and, in fact until about 200 years ago when the Protestants adopted a condensed version of the Canon eliminating the Deuterocanonicals from their Bibles. Even the AKJ originally contained the complete Christian Canon. It has been said by critics of Christ’s Church that the Deuterocanonicals were never believed to be inspired and just the opposite is true. The decision by Christians as to which books are inspired and useful for teaching was decided at the African Synods in the late fourth and early fifth century. There was never a question about their inspiration. <br>  <br>  The OT Canon chosen by the Protestants is actually a Jewish Canon not chosen by the Jews until after the establishment of Christianity as a result of the spread of Christianity to slow the growth of the new group in Jerusalem after the fall of the Temple in 70AD. Until then as I said previously there were many Canons in use. The adoption of the Canon missing the Deuterocanonicals united the Jews against the Christians was decided in the Jewish Council of Jamnia because the Deuterocanonicals referred too strongly to the Messiah fulfilled in Christ. <br>  <br>  Some Protestants will claim that only the Jews have the authority to choose Canon but the Church deferred that decision to Christ and the disciples and it is clear through biblical research, that the Septuagint is the Bible used by the first century Church and quoted in the NT Scriptures. The fact that Protestants choose to adopt the Canon that was approved by the same Jews that accused our Lord that resulted in His crucifixion suggests the source of this confusion as from the father of lies who led the Pharisees to accuse Christ and petition for His punishment. It is another way that Satan divides the body of Christ and separates the faithful denying Christ’s prayer that we all be one in Christ through His Church. The Christian Church has always used the Septuagint as Canon and never the truncated version of modernist Protestants.<br>  <br>  Some Protestants erroneously believe that Catholics added to the Bible with the Deuterocanonicals but this shows an ignorance of their own history and the history of Christianity as witnessed by Christ’s Church. The facts are that the Protestants removed the Deuterocanonicals and even considered strongly to remove some of the NT books currently in use by Protestants and Catholics. Fr. Martin Luther was in favor of removing the book of James because it conflicted with His heretical man made doctrines of the “Solas”, Sola Scriptura and Sola Fide. The heretic Ulrich Zwingli wanted to remove the Gospel of John because of its teaching of the commandment to Eat Christ’s Body and drink His Blood which contradicted his view of a real absence of Christ instead of a real presence in the Eucharist. Even Fr. Martin Luther could not endorse such a departure from Scriptures and deny that Christ is truly and really present in the Eucharist in Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity.
czf6uhIraa	Thank you!<br>  Free will cannot logically exist alongside an omniscient and omnipotent god!  "God" himself cannot even have free will if he is truly omniscient, because he already knows every single thing that that he will ever do.  He would have no choice but to do what he already sees himself doing.<br>  I've asked this kind of question a few times before, but they usually respond with answers that are either irrelevant or illogical.|`|lMmhkeZ0aa	It depends on your idea of god.  I don't believe in an anthropomorphic god making a gazillion decisions regarding individual live and circumstances.  I believe that all there is, is god; consciousness.  Everything that is, is an expression of the one consciousness, within consciousness.  If everything is an expression of god, within god, then how's that for omnipresence and omniscience.  If all there is, is god, then hows that for omnipotence?  If there is only one power, then there is no power left over for anything else.  One power = no power as power is applied force.  If there is nothing to apply force to, then....<br>  <br>  To me, god is ising.  In this eternal now.  There is no past or future.  God is ising.  God is not wasing.  The past is merely a collection of thoughts and ideas in the now.  The future is merely those concepts of the past, projected into the non-existent future.  Time and space reside within consciousness.  They are physical concerns as matter needs time to exist and space to exist in.  All within what is. NOW.  How's that for eternal?  Eternal is not a length of time.  It is outside of time.  Eternally now.  Creation is NOW.<br>  <br>  Free will, to me, is the decision we make in the now to follow our ego or our expression of consciousness.  Ego is our concepts of how things ought to be.  A collection of judgments.  Ego is fear based and our basic fear is that we do not measure up to our ego.  The nature of consciousness (god) is love.  When we are not in fear (controlled by ego), then our natural state of being is that of love.  We operate on one of these two primary feelings at all times.  All other feelings are secondary to one of these two.  Feelings are compounded and amplified by our ego.  Our head has an opinion (baggage) tied to the feeling that amplifies it to something greater than the moment.  Amplified feelings are what I consider emotions.  They are feeling with a story attached.  A story formed from the past brought into the now.  Out of proportion to the now.<br>  <br>  Our individual expression of the one consciousness (god), is who we are when our head isn't running it's stories.  That's why meditation is a good way to experience who we really are.  Once the head stops running it's stories, we can feel the Presence.  We can be aware of our expression of what is. Of being.  What is the awareness behind all of your thoughts?  Who is the observer?  It is the awareness of what is.  And you are that.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Everything God said will happen, will happen.|`|iMeh9lMbaa	well it is impossible don't u think?|`|sJZXhPxyaa	I think they found a loophole in the movie Dogma.

However wearing the Hijab at first is very tough, especially if your living in a Western Society. <br>  I went to a school where me and my siblings were the only Muslims, and it was hard at first, but everyone was really nice about it. Most people (including the teachers lol) were just curious and had alot of questions for us to answer.<br>  There was always admiration for me and my sisters from the teachers, they were amazed at us for some reason.|`|24GV16gVaa	idk i wear it and i dont get any stares i dont know why ppl dont wear it sooner cus u will b asked about it on the day of judgement <br>  i know some friends who are like 18 and r saying that they'll start b4 they go to collage but y wait|`|dW9pFT9Daa	In reality (excluding religion that is) You have one life to live...why do you want to spend the rest of it hiding behind a piece of cloth that degrades you?

If you had wisdom you wouldn't conform to the ideas of others. You would follow what you think is right.<br>  <br>  Muslim people can be very close minded.<br>  <br>  Why would you need to be so modest in society. God created us to be equal, not to be judged by some ridiculous rule.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to offend you, but you did ask what the other reasons for not wearing a Hijab are.<br>  <br>  Take it from someone who knows muslims - and who also comes from a country that is suppressed by them = Iraq<br>  <br>  You didn't want to understand what I was saying - which shows how close minded you are and very naive. Stop worrying about your religion so much and start thinking about others and what else goes on in their lives.<br>  <br>  ROFL - naive doesn't mean your self centered darling<br>  Just let it go.  Let's just agree to disagree  ;P|`|tP40FRz5aa	I haven't yet because I feel unsafe to do so because I live in a predominantly Western society.  I also feel contradicting to wear it because I listen to music, don't pray often, and have friends which are guys.  Though that doesn't mean that I'm not religious, I love Allah and I think that wearing the Hijab is a wonderful thing, though I'm not sure if I start wearing it that I can automatically stop all the things I just listed above.  I know that I will wear it eventually, but being 17 I feel a bit confused and need to be 100% sure before I start wearing it.<br>  <br>  Also its about attraction - if i want a husband im scared that after we marry and i take off my hijab what if he doesnt find me physically attractive and doesnt want to have sex with me.  Its not pius but its human nature and its a thing to worry about!|`|LfgGtjCdaa	I wear it :)<br>  <br>  But I guess the most famous reason is : "I'm not ready for it" and the person is usually quite old lmso.|`|Ca29B3eiaa	i wear hijab alhamdullilah. may allah strengthen all those that dont have the courage/strength to wear it. <br>  <br>  p.s. asker: you still have that pic. up?!

The guidance of a higher power is what religion and spirituality is all about. If you don't believe in it, why are you here in this section?<br>  <br>  It is kind of like the guy who was hanging out in the Pregancy section the other day, giving advice to women who had serious questions about their pregnancies. His 'advice' and input was not believable nor was it wanted. He should not have been there since his input really could not have helped anyone. The best he could do was, 'when my neighbor was pregnant....' or 'I once saw this lady who was pregnant...'<br>  <br>  I don't hang out in the Cars section or the computer section or the politics section because I KNOW I cannot give an educated, original, useful answer on those topics. <br>  <br>  Can an atheist really help someone who is truly seeking answers/guidance in R&S if the atheist has no experience there?|`|MiAOnwN6aa	There are some Christians who would prefer not to preach to atheists since theologians teach that the existence of God can be determined by natural reason. But since original sin clouds reason, some atheists are either incapable or unwilling to use their reason in that manner. My own personal experience has indicated that the real reasons for unbelief are based upon moral or/and emotional reasons (feelings)  rather than upon any intellectual conviction. There probably are some rare exceptions, but I have not found any. However, we (I) cannot judge. Only God can really judge.|`|373KJjiOaa	Because instead of asking questions politely you attack us with polemic. A large number of the posts that atheists make on this site follow the following pattern "Christian are stupid, atheists are more intelligent, Christians are delusional" etc. Another pattern that you guys use is deliberately using profane concepts to attack Christianity, I cannot count the number of sexually explicit jokes that have been made at the sake of Christianity. <br>  <br>  We do not want rude people on a site dedicated for the discussion of religion. This place should be for those of us who want to exchange information and have polite discussions, not a place where we are insulted on a regular basis because of our religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  To "If It's Too Loud...", I agree atheists are not the only rude people on this site.

It is no wonder life is bad for atheists...they spend there every breathe denying and blaspheming our creator...GOD which will one day have to be answered for.  Atheists constantly attack Christians verbally calling us stupid, brainwashed, etc...when in fact atheists are stupid because they would rather spend eternity in torment and hell than to accept and believe in God and live in peace and happiness.  I would rather believe in something good and something beyond this life than belief in nothing and go through life miserable with no hope of nothing.  To each is own in their beliefs but I prefer to make heaven my home...not hell.  Everyone will have to give an account for the life they led while on this earth before God one day whether you believe in him or not.|`|dtq0YJIPaa	They only want to hear their opinions and nobody else's.

Many will expect or "seek" that they will be part of the chosen people to go to heaven or be on a Paradise earth. But not many will make it at all. Some people live a double life, or see what they want to see in the bible. Others take it as a joke. People even say that all religions will eventually lead to the same place. But that can't be true because most are not practicing what the bible really teaches. That's why Jesus made the statement to ?“Exert yourselves vigorously" Luke13:24<br>  The word vigorously can be understood as being steady and persevering activity; painstaking effort; diligence; zealous. As people following Christ wouldn't we want to vigorously be trying to make it in the new world order? That means abstaining from such practices as fornication, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, criminal acts weather financially or domestic, being greedy persons, drunkards, or revilers.(1Corinthians 6:9,10) And not just thinking that if you pray that your sin will just go away. <br>  We must really take this really seriously and do a self examination.|`|b62aa03435c366476a024d6636bd1414aa	Matthew 7:21?“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. 22?Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ 23?And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew YOU! Get away from me, YOU workers of lawlessness.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of people are going to be very surprised they were not saved.

In other words, many people who claim to be Christians will NOT be saved. Being a true worshipper of God involves living every aspect of our lives according to God's will, and we demonstrate our faith by our works. Many churches don't teach this, and many people are being misled. Jesus also said, "his true disciples would be hated among the world - Matthew 24:9,11" Ask yourselves - does the world hate me? If not, you're likely not with the right religion.|`|Wo1BkKTBaa	I feel the same about every quote in the bible. Pure madness.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

hzMpdFFBaa	I was born into a monotheistic religion (Catholicism) and in fact was very involved with it when I was a teenager. I had an interest in other religions, though. I tried to integrate what I thought was meaningful from religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism into Catholicism but my Catholic friends kept telling me that I was a misguided idolator so I stopped practicing Catholicism and ultimately became interested in Universalism, which then led me to become an adherent of Advaita  Vedanta--a form of Hinduism. I believe I  in monism not monotheism. That is, I do not believe that "God" is a "creator" or a spiritual entity ; I believe that God is Reality itself and everything is a manifestation of God and is not real or lasting otherwise. This has given me the freedom to study many different spiritual philosophies and disciplies: Tantric Hinduism and yoga, forms of Buddhism, and recently Hermeticism and Western Occultism, all while still maintaining my core beliefs related to Vedanta.|`|oVHFz52Laa	I was born into Christian family.

AA12350023	well I am a moderate person (I do wear hijab, but my thoughts is this)<br>  there are all sorts of people who interpret their own faith differently..<br>  Liquor is a sin, correct? but many muslims drink<br>  Smoking cigarettes or taking of any tobacco is a sin, but many muslims (oh, you cant imagine how many) smoke..<br>  some muslims dont do their regular 5 daily prayers.<br>  some muslims like to eat pork..<br>  some muslim men like to go west and (sew their wild oats) as they say in the movies... <br>  there are sins we all bear, <br>  would you say if you chose to not cover your hair, but do try to live a good moral life.. is that a worse sin than drinking alcohol? its only up to Allah to be the final judge.. Im not condoning taking off the scarf, but its up to you...|`|OJWApbmbaa	No and ie there is no mention in the Holy book of punishment for not wearing hijab.|`|iUL0GU3paa	i dunno if it would be called a "sin" but it is definitely Haram not to wear hijab.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	I'm sure it is but ask aalim to make sure <a href="http://www.islamqa.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamqa.com</a>|`|8gYee3UPaa	assalamu alaykom<br>  <br>  in islam, it is asked of a woman to cover herself and to be modest and pure. you are only displeasing Allah and satisfying yourself. we warned you enough times. if you feel it is unnecessary for you to wear it, by all means do not and you tell Allah when He asks you that you did not wear the Hijab because you did not want to, and because you wanted to show your hair. <br>  <br>  it is not necessarily a "sin" but you are ASKED by Allah to cover, why would you not cover?<br>  <br>  assalamu alaykom|`|h6vqu7mjaa	Are you struggling with it? want to find a way to get around the whole hijab thingy? not saying that's what you are doing but I have seen it before.

Their heads would be like the humps of the bukht camel inclined to one side. They will not enter Paradise and they would not smell its odour whereas it odour would be smelt from such and such distance."|`|qpcYYWlIaa	Allah just wants Muslims (men and women) to be modest. There are no requirements for hijabs. You can be all clothed and still not be modest. If you feel, you must cover your hair, a scarf is more than sufficient. <br>  <br>  Do not heed those who tell you it is a sin. Quran does not say that. Only the mullah type do, the kind you may find in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.
2Ss64ScQaa	It is an undefinable connection of two people.|`|wig9WKPwaa	Hmm, in my view it is when you deeply care about the other person's happiness and well-being. So, love can occur between anyone, men or women. People too often blend love and physical attraction together, which is not true at all.

bb06GQ5Paa	If we expect other people to own up to their mistakes, then we should be more than willing to own up to our own.  We get mad at white people for claiming to be saints and then we sit back and claim to be saints ourselves.  Bill Cosby told nothing but the truth a few years ago.  More of that please!|`|AA10873763	I'm curious why you define those as black issues.<br>  Aren't they human issues?  Isn't the goal to stop defining and dividing by race?|`|AA10866651	Mental illness, dietary issues, parenting, and sexual abuse are not exclusively black issues and should not be treated as such.  <br>  <br>  And back in the day, airing ANY of these personal issues out in public by ANY racial or ethnic group was thought to be common, low-class, and in bad taste.  It's not about not addressing the issues; it's about having any need to address these issues IN PUBLIC.  There are reasons why we all laugh at the freaks on Jerry Springer.  <br>  <br>  If you have these issues, then that's YOUR personal and private business.  If you have these issues in your family, then that is your family's business.  It is NOT a racial thing.  If you need to seek help and/or need a support group and you would prefer to find all-black prorfessional help or support, these resources do exist.  <br>  <br>  Dealing with personal and family issues privately has absolutely nothing to do with being "self-hating blacks".  These are NOT problems of the black community -  they are personal problems.  Problems of the black community that we need to discuss AS a community are things like poverty, crime, drugs, teen pregnancy, education, HIV/AIDS, healthcare, and unemployment.|`|ncdTxID9aa	I've watched shows where people were black talking about their lives and some of them have been molested or some did drugs, some lost their homes.  It's not different from other people with hard lives.  Even in church I've heard black people give their testimonies on how hard their lives were. I think when some black people know about these struggles they choose to deny it and turn it into a racial thing, where they'll say well white people molest or murder their kids, blah blah.  When every thing based on society is not a racial thing.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Ebony O it seems as if you have some issues of your own....how about you solve your problem first before you decide to take on an entire community.<br>  <br>  I understand what you are saying and I do agree with you to an extent but the way you are going about it makes people want to keep "our" issues more behind closed doors then yelling it from the mountain tops|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	"It seems that we don't talk enough about the issues in our race (mental illness, dietary issues, parenting, sexual abuse)"<br>  <br>  Those are not issues exclusive to our race.<br>  <br>  "when we do...we're seen as self hating blacks."<br>  <br>  Not necessarily. But again, see my answer above.<br>  <br>  "Large or small issues should be addresses don't you agree?"<br>  <br>  Absolutely.<br>  <br>  "whats the danger of publicly discussing problems in the black community."<br>  <br>  The only danger is in giving excuses to racist(conscious and unconscious) to come down on us, and justify their stereotypes by equating negative things with being black.<br>  <br>  "what are the dangers on NOT discussing them?"<br>  <br>  People are less aware of them, or make less of an effort to do things to change them.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think it's unnecessary to focus on these things as issues of race, because they certainly don't effect all black people. And much of this depends on where certain black people fall on the social strata. Oprah certainly has no personal issue with black crime except as it reflects on her as a black person. But she doesn't live it. She is not impoverished or underprivileged. It doesn't help to assume that things like sexual abuse and mental illness as you mentioned are problems all black share and need to address. We are much less of a united community now than we were 40 years ago when segregation and Jim Crow was still in play. The world is a bit different and it is important to take that into account. Class divides people more than race does.|`|g8JGLnk6aa	It's easier to shove problems under the door than to talk about them. Talking about them means we recognize that they exist. Recognizing that problems exist means that  we will have to take some responsibility for ourselves and solve them. Taking responsibility for problems and solving them means putting forth a lot of effort which takes time, energy, pain and the unlodging of familiar ingrained habits and lifestyles.<br>  <br>  And I speak generally. This is true for any problem for any person, regardless of race, gender, nationality, sexual orientation or what have you.|`|Onzxe6ysaa	The dangers of addressing these problems is that you perpetuate the idea that black people only care about their own race. When these problems are human, why do you limit the discussion to black people?  In fact, these issues are discussed regularly, and it is not focused on a particluar race of people.|`|aHlpWFVhaa	I feel that these issues can not been prevented or helped <br>  <br>  in any way by discussing them amongst random strangers<br>  <br>  on YA!, so what is the point exactly? <br>  <br>  P.s.

Your brain is full of unanswered questions and doubt. I went through the same thing, actually. <br>  I'm a Christian, and I believe we came from God. He created us in his image! HE actually took the time to form us and make us all unique. If you read Genesis carefully, you will see that whenever he created the rest of the universe he just spoke "let there be......" and there it was."And it was so". He is so powerful that all he has to do is say something! How crazy! BUT when it came to us, it's a different story...Genesis 1:26-27 "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.'<br>  But we, as humans, have to have a "logical" answer to everything. we can't fathom forever. we can't fathom the thought of absolutely nothing, because when we think of nothing it's something (if that makes sense)! We are SO ignorant compared to God! Isaiah 55:8-9 "'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,' declares the LORD. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.'"<br>  And I know why you feel so uneasy and scared. I went through a period of my life without God and it freaked the crap out of me! I tried my best to forget about it and I made myself insanely busy, hoping i wouldn't have time to be freaked out. I was miserable and I remember being SO sad all the time! I mean it was a wonderful day if I had 5 minutes of happiness! But God woke me up and gave me a little slap to the face, and now I am one of the happiest people around! It's amazing what God can do :) :) :) Remember he loves you no matter what! You and I are his children whether we like it or not, and even when he punishes us he does it because he loves us and calls us his children. Hebrews 12:5-6 "And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons: 'My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.'"<br>  As for the feelings that aren't at ease....Matthew 11:28 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." Psalm 34:8 "Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him, and he delivers them." Psalm 34:4-5 "I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears.  Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame." Psalm 4: 6-8 "Many are asking, 'Who can show us any good?' Let the light of your face shine upon us, O Lord.  You have filled my heart with greater joy then when their grain and new win abound. I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety." Philippians 4:7 "And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." Colossians 3:15 "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful."....Just a few :) Hope this helped!|`|N9VWMIFxaa	The Paledians.

Supposedly NASA is developing ways of destroying it before it strikes. <br>  <br>  All I know is the year 2012 will be chaotic nonetheless just like when July 6th 2006 happened 06/06/06. [aka year 666]<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I too watched a show about this and the prophet Nostradamus predicted the world would end in 2012 but said that we have the power to change it. Basically they told us that if we keep going the rate we're going with global warming, and such we're going to destroy ourselves. Also they said that every race has a beginning and an end, like the dinosaurs dying so the mammals began to thrive. Humans will be extinct and a new species will be the dominance.|`|HcVkUVOTaa	I don't think so. Everyone thought the world was going to end in 2000 and we are still here.

wB3AbJyLaa	The whole reincarnation idea is just really difficult to believe because more people are being born all the time and the world's population is growing. But if souls just die and come back, where are all the extra souls coming from? New ones? And are no souls being enlightened and going to Nirvana? It just doesn't make sense. It also ignores what's essential to people, what makes them who they are. For instance, if you say, "Bob is no the other room, and he has lost five pounds," people might say, "Good for him." What if you said, "Bob is in the other room and guess what? He's a grasshopper." Most people would say, "That can't be Bob, because if there's one thing I know about him, it's that he's human. He's not a grasshopper." Well, reincarnation says that I could come back as a grasshopper. But if that's true, I wouldn't be Bob anymore. I would be a grasshopper. My humanness is an essential part of who I am. Another reason I don't believe in reincarnation is that the evidence for it, things like memories of past lives, can be explained by other means: Psychological explanations, or lucky guesses, or even demonic influence. Lastly, if I become a reincarnated snail, how do I retrieve a human form? By being a good snail?|`|QsVMeaPXaa	For a minuscule period of time I gave it some credence. How can you learn and grow enough in one lifetime? What is the point of just one life and dying or going to Heaven? Is one life a person's 'trial period" or what?<br>  <br>  I did some reading and purportedly there are more people alive today than ever lived in the history of humankind. So if you believe people only reincarnate as humans, the theory doesn't hold water. If you believe we can come back as other species, well at least it makes a tad more sense.<br>  I'd hate to think of life after life and having to be born, be a helpless baby at the mercy of who knows what kind of people, have to go to school and learn all the basics again.....arrgh!|`|mSFjbetxaa	Like Jesus, I do believe in reincarnation.

ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	Firstly... what does the story about the puppy have to do with any of this?<br>  <br>  Secondly. I would say for a good money spell you can do for your parents without telling them, you can offer to help clean their house -- this will improve the feng shui among other things. But mainly, either use a floorwash like Money Drawing formula, or else just boil a bunch of water with basil or thyme or cinnamon before mixing in the soap. These are all prosperity herbs. Wash their house with this herbal mixture, and be sure to think favorable thoughts for them as you do so.|`|dFBccLExaa	I would almost say it's karmic debt, and to let it be, they shouldn't have a puppy if they can't take care of it. So I personally wouldn't worry about it... <br>  But as for spells, there are many ways you could go about it. You could go from a Chinese/Feng Shui standpoint, or you could go with spells. For Feng Shui, you could try hanging bells on your doorknob, or coins above the door. in your bed room, the corner that is on the wall furthest from you, and to the left- that corner, make sure there are no candles there, and add yang items, or items that represent money. For bagua styled FS, this corner is used to attract wealth. <br>  For a Japanese hint, you could use a furin charm- where you write down what you want on a slip of paper, and then hang it from a windchime. <br>  You could also make a paper charm to keep in your wallet to attract money to it. <br>  Lots and lots of ways lol. If you want, you can email me, and I can give you a more step by step approach if you need it.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	I'm confused.  What does this whole story with the puppy have to do with your rent? being raised $50/month?<br>  <br>  Your additional details do not include anything about your level of knowledge of or experience with working magic.  <br>  <br>  Some say you should not cast a spell on another without their permission.  If you believe this, then you could cast the spell on yourself to draw in the needed extra money that you could give to your folks - call it room & board as you want to help out with the living expenses or something.<br>  <br>  But, sorry, I create my own spells for my personal needs, or that of my friends and family who ask for my help - my spells would not likely be very helpful to you as they are personalized to me.  And as a general rule, I do not give spells to strangers.|`|de109ccf1349bcb7dcc5e78fb10fcbe6aa	I think it is wonderful that you helped the puppy and want to help your parents.

O26WPM7iaa	I am applying to a fashion-focused boarding school in NY and I have spoken to lots of people who go there and this is the deal:<br>  <br>  boarding school kids have classes every day, core classes (math, english, science, and history) and also their chosen classes (at this school it's like fashion design, knitting, etc.) Teachers are not so strict about tardiness, absences, etc., however it is not like college where you can just skip classes!!!<br>  <br>  LOTS OF HOLIDAYS! it is so stupid how public school kids never get a break. BS kids work much harder and make the most of each day so they get longer holidays (2 weeks).<br>  <br>  I have seen the dorms and they have nice big windows, and three plain little beds, plus a shelf above each bed and a walk-in closet that all 3 girls will share. You can bring in a little desk if you like, but everyone just sits on their bed. there is also a tall mirror (but this is fashion school so maybe that is why)<br>  <br>  You can leave the campus pretty rarely because they do not want everyone running away. However you can sign up for special usually educational trips (at fashion school they get group shopping trips in the city!) but lots of museum trips you take with your class, etc.<br>  <br>  The teachers are usually very kind and caring and really hope you're well at all times. If they see you are stressed or sad they will talk to you. classes are fairly small. <br>  <br>  that's about all I can think of! good luck with whatever you are writing pepper. =D

I look around me and see nice people doing nice things. <br>  There have always been problems in society - read your history books ! I suspect that we are better off, healthier,and happier than at any time in history. Its one thing to compare our childhood lives to today....try comparing the life of someone in the 1600's to now.

The problem today is that those lower classes comprise a much larger segment of our society in the United States.There vote changes our homeland. As a people we lowered our standards and demanded less and less from the coming generations. People seem to maintain better standards when they are struggling to stay afloat. During good times we seem to make the mistake of relaxing our standards and our conduct becomes void of pride and decency. Liberal social acceptance of " To each his own"  and ' anything goes " destroys pride and respect for self and others. Politically Correct  is  the excuse we accept to describe liberalism that destroys the moral fabric of this once proud nation. Disagree with me if you like. Your grandchildren will live with the results of your errors. There children will suffer from your errors in judgment.  Their children will despise you and hold you in contempt.

People don't read things like Satan is coming in the name of Jesus, so they fall victim to these doctrines of devils. You can lead a blind man anywhere.<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 11:3-4,13-15<br>  3But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. <br>  4For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. <br>  13For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. <br>  14And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.<br>   5Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. <br>  <br>  Isaiah 14:12-14 <br>  12How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! <br>  13For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: <br>  14I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. <br>  15Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.<br>  <br>  The being that every one thinks is God the Holy Ghost is non other than Gabriel his comforter, that comes in the name of Jesus also.<br>  <br>  John 14:15-18,26<br>  15If ye love me, keep my commandments. <br>  16And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; <br>  17Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. <br>  18I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<br>  26But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. <br>  <br>  According to the scripture that you see here before you, one must keep the commandments in order for the Spirit of truth which is the Holy Ghost to visit you.The world cannot receive this spirit because they refuse to keep the commandments. What we must do now is define the terms with scripture in order to get the truth.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 1:5-7,14<br>  5For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? <br>  6And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. <br>  7And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. <br>  14Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?<br>  <br>  So all Holy Angels are ministering SPIRITS that are Holy thus being Holy Spirits.This is the so called mystery of the Trinity of God. The Father gives the word to the Son and the Son gives it to the Spirit of Truth which is a Holy Angel/Spirit/Ghost.<br>  <br>  John 16:7,13-15<br>  7Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. <br>  13Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <br>  14He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. <br>  15All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<br>  <br>  This is Jesus telling you that after he leaves to go back to heaven, he will communicate with you through his Holy Spirit(Angel).<br>  <br>  Revelation 1:1-2<br>  1The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: <br>  2Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. <br>  <br>  Revelation 22:13-21<br>  13I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. <br>  14Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. <br>  15For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie. <br>  16I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. <br>  17And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. <br>  18For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: <br>  19And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. <br>  20He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. <br>  21The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

That religion continued well after the time of the NT. Montanus began to teach a triune godhead in Christianity in the mid-second century. It was simply a modified form of the Babylonian trinity.

Greece and Asia Minor were mostly Arian and Gnostic, and Judea and north Africa were mostly teaching the Apostle's doctrine.<br>  <br>  At the council of Nicea, Bishops from all three groups gathered. The purpose of the council was supposed to be to settle the differences. Instead, the trinitarian bishops presented a doctrinal statement that was unacceptable to the others. The others refused to accept it, and the trinitarians excommunicated them. From 325 AD, trinitarianism became the official teaching of the Roman Church.|`|332vXA6oaa	The scriptures not only show that Jesus is not God. But that he is the Son of God an angel.

It was not in existence prior to that.<br>  <br>  The Council of Nicea<br>  When Constantine defeated Emperor Licinius in 323 AD he ended the persecutions against the Christian church. Shortly afterwards Christians faced a trouble from within: the Arian controversy began and threatened to divide the church. The problem began in Alexandria, it started as a debate between the bishop Alexander and the presbyter (pastor, or priest) Arius. Arius proposed that if the Father begat the Son, the latter must have had a beginning, that there was a time when he was not, and that his substance was from nothing like the rest of creation. The Council of Nicea, a gathering similar to the one described in Acts 15:4-22, condemned the beliefs of Arius and wrote the first version of the now famous creed proclaiming that the Son was "one in being with the Father" by use of the Greek word "homoousius." <br>  <br>  You who claim the trinity was established in Genesis don't know your scriptures or history very well.  Not only was the trinity NOT in existence prior to the Council of Nicea but Constantine, who brought the Council together, threatened them with death, (one man a day) if they DIDN'T come to agreement. <br>  <br>  Do your research.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	His "Identity" is One Holy Compound Unit!  <')))><|`|kO7xsy6xaa	It only seems to bother people having no mind.|`|VRl1jENHaa	We still have many manuscripts written by disciples of the Apostles -- and they ALL stated, in one way or another, that God is Triune in nature.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question:  the Trinity teaching was taught from the beginning; the "diabolical" ones are those who deny it.

I think it was the Council at Nicea during which there was a leveraged vote to begin teaching the Trinity doctrine.  Before that time, such a thing was never taught or believed by any Christians, and it certainly wasn't believed by Jesus while he walked the earth.  I would look up the recorded information on the Council at Nicea and I think you'll find an eye-opener.  The biggest shame was how when protestants broke away from the Catholic Church, nearly all of them (all but the Unitarians) took with them that ridiculous recursive doctrine.  I forget the exact process that lead them to such a false teaching, but it had something to do with the desire to elevate Jesus to a godlike status, and it ended up with a bit of opposition when they tried to include the Holy Spirit (not even a person of any sort according to Bible teachings).  However, under coersion and various leveraging tactics they managed to call the vote unanimous.|`|mwdtZUPkaa	LOL, why do so many suggest that Genesis (1:26) teaches the Trinity?  Whenever I read this it seems to imply that God was speaking to someone else.  This scripture lends more support to Non-Trinitarianism than it does to Trinitarianism, yet so many Trinitarians seem to love it.<br>  <br>  I understand that if you believe God is "plural" (in the sense that he is three gods in one), it might make sense that God would speak to himself as a plural being  ("Let us make man...").<br>  <br>  However, if that was the case, why wouldn't God always refer to himself as a plural being?  For example, he frequently says, "I am the Lord your God" instead of "We are the Lord your God".  Also, he regularly refers to himself as "me" instead of "us" (e.g., Gen. 9:12, 17:1, etc.).<br>  <br>  What's up with the inconsistency?|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	<a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/article_04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/article_0...</a>|`|b0d1be009491a87c770b3458819fb122aa	DONALD K.

Um...no. Dan Brown has nothing whatsoever to do with the evidence that the trinity is a false teaching. <br>  <br>  RESEARCH shows that historically the diabolical Trinity teaching was rehashed by Constantine and his political buddies out of good old greed for power.  It really was based on old Babylonian trinities. This is historical fact. It was then forced on the so-called Christians of the day.  Anyone who doubts this has not done THEIR research. <br>  <br>  The trinity is not a Biblical doctrine. Trinitarians try to bend themselves into a pretzel to try to make obtuse reasons why it is "implied".<br>  <br>  Quite simply it is not there - implied or otherwise. It is a Satanic teaching designed to obscure Bible truth and divert worship from the only true God Jehovah. The God that Jesus himself worshiped. Fact. Simple, plain, incredibly obvious fact.
RMsHTePVaa	Sounds like my moms suburbia neighborhood where everybody tries to out do each other  but I don't think anyone spent $1000 on a microwave. Maybe a washing machine though lol. If they are still living this lifestyle in 5 years then yea I would say they are banking but it sounds to me they probably inherited a large amount of money.  People with new money spends like that. Most rich people especially the ones who earned their money the hard way and not celebrities or lottery winners  don't spend friviolousy. The way they are spending they will be broke sooner then later..lol.  How do you know how much they are actually spending?  Perhaps they live in a luxuirous neighborhood but maybe their spending habits are just fairy tale and stretched.. By the way Mercedes don't cost that much my mom bought mine for under $45 and they start at 29k. It doesn't symbolize rich. Toyota is typical suburban car lol but I don't find many rich ppl driving one. All that can be done on a $150 - $200,000 salary. That is not rich.

sfuIoLjvaa	Muslim men blame a woman when the man gets a hard on. So they force all women to cover up. They feel shameful about their hard on. That′s why Muslim men believe a woman asks to get raped.<br>  <br>  This is the kind of sick thinking that comes from religion. <br>  <br>  Funny thing is in genesis they were kicked out of the garden of eden for covering themselves up.|`|lNIlO3Wkaa	send your wife naked picture to me<br>  <br>  moh.2050@yahoo.com|`|gHUHcPFwaa	Despite contrary belief Women in Islam are held very highly. <br>  It is not wrong to look at a women but looking at her due to you being attracted to her in this case looks is honestly wrong. I am a women and as all women of course we like attention however I would rather be respected for what I say and do then how I look. Its called lowering your gaze and in fact women are ordered to do the same in Islam. This is a respect and a protection for both. <br>  <br>  As for the comment about "Would you want someone staring at your sister!!!!!" This type of staring he/she is talking about is the person would think your sis is hot. And would most likely want to do her or something in that manner. So in respect for his sister that she should not be thought of in such a way.|`|zI946Wbdaa	maybe we just want to be modest like God commanded us to be? ok some muslims don't like it, they don't think its decent, so whats the problem? you yourself said that you kind of disapprove of it (i know not the way we do) but can't you atleast see where we're coming from? its not like whenever we see men looking at women, we start beheading them and start riots lol... but yes, some muslims will find it very wrong while others would be cool about it. its wrong in our religion to be looking at women like that since women should be respected. like other users said here, its not like just 'looking' at her is a sin, but when you look at her... in 'that' way lol. and when other people were telling you about how you'd feel if your sister was being stared at like that, all they meant was that you'd be protective of her and not want her to be harmed... and if you have a sister i hope thats the case ^_^ ... but yeah thats what they meant.<br>  <br>  this is just how we muslims are, we are suppose to be modest for God. if you want to go looking at women, fine. but theres no reason why, if a man wants to make sure his sister or mother are not being disrespected that way, that its a bad thing. ok i'm not saying that you were criticizing, though you dont seem to like us muslims much but never mind, but this is our way of life. in our religion, we should be modest. there are some muslims who aren't all like that and do look at women and of course there are those that dont.   <br>  <br>  salam x|`|mVSC9aKoaa	It is very easy to win a debate if you talk from both sides.|`|AA10481071	I think it's great that they stay covered up and want to prevent lust.<br>  <br>  But I'm glad I don't live there, because women are beautiful,  I don't like to see them covered up,  but I don't put them down for that.<br>  <br>  They are doing the right thing.

A woman must hide any part of her body as not to tempt any mans desires or thoughts. And a man shows no interest in any woman but only the sincere verbal interest in finding a mate for life.<br>  <br>  Staring at a woman is offensive and may exposes sexual thoughts, a brief casual look is accepted.<br>  <br>  There is no "dating" there, when a man has an interest in a woman is must be STRICTLY for marriage. He approaches her parents FIRST to ask to be able to see her, if they accept, then the parents ask the daughter if she has an interest. Then the man ONLY visits the home of the family and is never alone with the woman, IF he is allowed to go to dinner, movie or function, they MUST be chaperoned by another family member. After 4-6 months the man proposes if accepted by the woman, and must provide a few thousand dollar gift to the parents.<br>  <br>  How impressed i was about this culture, being born in america,  with the gowing population becoming out of control with public sexuality<br>  <br>  Would you rather bring up children there knowing they are 95% more safe in public??? and as you value this being a parent, your were glad to partisipate when you were single.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Well, I am not Muslim, but my significant other is.  It's a sin for Muslims to look at women with the thought of lust or sexual ideas about them.  And I do believe that is out of respect.  As a woman who is often "hit on" and "checked out" I absolutely feel disgusted by it.  I wish I could smack every man that does it to me.  I don't wear form fitting clothes for this reason.  I prefer to cover up with a long jacket when I am out, say, at the mall shopping or something.  I still get the looks but at least when I am a bit more covered I do not feel so violated.  At least I know they can't imagine my body by looking at my face.  I do appreciate the extra care and attention Muslim men give to women.  I am absolutely a queen to my future hubby.  He has not changed at all in 4 years.  People warned me about Muslim men, I took my chances and I am so happy and blessed that I did.  It's not easy for an American woman to find acceptance with the family of a Muslim husband but it is possible with sacrafice and understanding from both sides.  I love the way they honor and cherish family and especially think its important to take good care of the women in their family and lives.  So you might ask yourself, who do you think is REALLY getting offended when you stare? I do think its the women, and the men are only doing their absolute best to protect the women they love.  Of course this is not always the case, but in mine, thats definitely it.  If I tell my man to give you a good old fashioned Islamic *** kicking for staring at me with eyes of lust, he will surely do it.  And in return they expect their cherished women not to shine a spotlight on themselves and parade around in skimpy clothes and show a lack of respect for themselves.  Pretty fair if that's what you want as a woman, isn't it?!  I love it. And I am not even Muslim.

BTW He does reveal himself, but it doesn't have to be in a physical way, he can reveal himself through a person, movie, the Bible, etc. Maybe you are too focused trying to see him as you want and you can't ,but maybe he is revealing through so many people and things around you, and you are just taking them as nothing. Try to look for Him not only in church, prayers, or Bible, look for him in your life because he can use a friend, a message, ANYTHING to try to reveal to you. Hope this helps...

UV7zs9Wzaa	I personally think that it means that if you truly get saved and live for Jesus, give into temptation and fall away from Him, that it is unlikely you will return to Him.|`|deQ4bSlPaa	There seems to be two main interpretations of these verses. One is that the writer seems to be saying that you can lose your salvation by falling away from faith in Christ, and that you cant even return in repentance once you've fallen away. Another view is that it describes someone who has fully tasted all that salvation of Christ is, and then, fully aware of all that hes turning his back on, just goes his own way, away from Christ & salvation. Apparently, if such a point is reached, it becomes "impossible to renew them again to repentance". <br>  <br>  You might want to reference Heb. 10:28-29 with the other verses: "Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"<br>  <br>  It would seem to be referring to someone who was once at least thoroughly knowledgeable about the message of salvation and quite familiar with the Christian life in the Spirit of God. Does it refer to someone who was once actually sealed unto eternity by the Holy Spirit? As much as that seems difficult to believe, I think the most natural reading of the verses in Hebrews 6 and 10 would suggest that. Falling away from the faith - in whole or in part - carries with it serious consequences (read the warnings to the churches in Rev. 3:5). It would seem that the verses in Hebrews are addressing the total renunciation of the Christian faith while having full knowledge of what he or she is doing in the process.|`|CmLDcfMfaa	Hebrews 6:4-6  This much-debated passage has been understood in several ways.  (1) Arminians hold that the people described in these verses are Christians who actually lose their salvation.  If this be so, notice that the passage also teaches that it is impossible to be saved a second time.  (2) Some hold that the passage refers not to genuine believers but to those who only profess to be believers.  Thus the phrases in verses 4-5 are understood to refer to experiences short of salvation (cf. V. 9).  The “falling away” is from the knowledge of the truth, not personal possession of it.  (3) Others understand the passage to be a warning to genuine believers to urge them on in Christian growth and maturity.  To “fall away” is impossible (since, according to this view, true believers are eternally secure), but the phrase is placed in the sentence to strengthen the warning.  It is similar to saying something like this to a class of students: “It is impossible for a student, once enrolled in this course, if he turns the clock back (which cannot be done,) to start the course over.  Therefore, let all students go on to deeper knowledge.”  In this view the phrases in verses 4-5 are understood to refer to the conversion experience.  Notice how the words “enlightened” (10:32); “taste” (2:9), and “partakers” (“share, “ 12:10) are used elsewhere in Hebrews of genuine experiences. <br>  <br>  Hebrews:7-8  Not to go on to fruitful maturity will result in loss of reward (1 Cor. 3:15)|`|PEVkrOVVaa	Hebrews 6:4-6 states, “For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.” This is one of the Bible’s most difficult passages to interpret, but one thing is clear—it does not teach that we can lose our salvation. There are two valid ways of looking at these verses:<br>  <br>  One interpretation holds that this passage is written not about Christians but about unbelievers who are convinced of the basic truths of the gospel but who have not placed their faith in Jesus Christ as Savior. They are intellectually persuaded but spiritually uncommitted.<br>  <br>  According to this interpretation, the phrase “once enlightened” (verse 4) refers to some level of instruction in biblical truth. However, understanding the words of scripture is not the same as being regenerated by the Holy Spirit. For example, John 1:9 describes Jesus, the “true Light,” giving light “to every man”; but this cannot mean the light of salvation, because not every man is saved. Through God’s sovereign power, every man has enough light to be held responsible. This light either leads to the complete acceptance of Jesus Christ or produces condemnation in those who reject such light. The people described in Hebrews 6:4-6 are of the latter group—unbelievers who have been exposed to God’s redemptive truth and perhaps have made a profession of faith, but have not exercised genuine saving faith.|`|7KeGDQyXaa	as i understand it...<br>  The people were turning away from the grace (unmerited gift of God) received by faith and beginning once again to follow rules. and regulations such as circumcision in order to be saved. The writer said if after experiencing God you reject his gift and return to your dead rules and regulation. there is no longer any help for you.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It is talking about believers that go into false gospels of works.  Notice that the entire theme of the Book of Hebrews up until these verses, and for some time after them, is trying to convince the listeners to fully abandon trying to be saved by keeping the law.  <br>  <br>  Hebrews 6 is saying to move into maturity.  That is, faith alone in Jesus, without works.  But some still push works.  The warning in verses 4-6 is, that if a person keeps thinking that they need works for salvation, then eventually they'll go so far into falsehoods that no man can bring them to a changed mind (repentance), only God is able to do that.  <br>  <br>  Such people that are believers but end up with false gospels of works, end up having their works burned up in heaven, where they have loss of rewards in  heaven (verse 8), but they are still in heaven because they had believed in Jesus alone without works at one time, and it is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13).|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Hebrews 6:4-6  play chapter / study / save / email / memorize  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  You need to upgrade your Flash PlayerYou must be signed in <br>  <br>  Don't have an eBible.com account?

You need milk, not solid food!13Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.14But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.<br>  <br>  <br>  Chapter 6<br>  1Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death,[1] and of faith in God,2instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.3And God permitting, we will do so.<br>  <br>  4It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,5who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age,6if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because[2] to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.<br>  <br>  7Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.8But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.<br>  <br>  9Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are confident of better things in your case–things that accompany salvation.10God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.11We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure.12We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised. <br>  <br>  There is much debate about precisely what this means.  There are Bible scholars far smarter than me who are truly DEBATING the meaning of this.  Research it for yourself and pray about it.  But my two cents is this:<br>  <br>  ALL Christians stumble before, during, and after their conversion.  This passage is NOT talking about stumbling, which is a disturbing pattern of occassional albeit rather consistent sinning.  As Christians, HOPEFULLY such sinning is very low-profile, and it causes us shame, and we feel rebuked for it, etc.  That's NOT falling away!  This is temporary weakness that shows itself in sin!<br>  <br>  I see "falling away" as a total turning your back on God.  Think of it as going back to the same sort of mind, body, and spirit that you had BEFORE your conversion.  The author is saying: If you could come out of that way of thinking and behaving and you've come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior and you've thought and behaved as a Christian then ... then ... inexplicably you've gone BACK to your old ways--COMPLETELY BACK?!--then that's the ultimate slap in God's face.  You can't recover from that!<br>  <br>  I hope you see that temporarily slipping into your old sinful ways is nothing like completely turning your back on the Lord for a prolonged period of time.  I ask you: HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?  Would you TRULY expect God to overlook that?<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|TMMjzaR0aa	can you post it, most people cant be bothered finding it|`|ccef80051a7e6b489b8e53068b490e70aa	While sitting in church recently, a friend leaned over to me and shared that she was troubled with a particular Scripture and wanted to know if I could explain it.

The NIV translation reads, <br>  “(4) It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, (5) who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age, (6) if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.  (7) Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.  (8) But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed.  In the end it will be burned.”  <br>  <br>  My friend informed me that a friend of hers had given her the verses with her own reasoning that she was “unsaveable.”  It seems she has committed some sins that she feels have doomed her to hell without hope of salvation.  That goes against everything I know as a Christian and so I determined to understand fully what this Scripture means.  As it so often happens, this Scripture by itself renders a completely wrong response when we read it by itself.  This Scripture tells us that “backsliders” are doomed.  It even hits on some detail – “once enlightened,” “tasted the heavenly gift,” “shared in the Holy Spirit.”  This is one of the most common mistakes we experience as Christians – misreading and misinterpreting God’s Word.  Doing that we can make the Bible say whatever we want it to say.  Romans 7:9 reads, <br>  “I felt fine when I did not understand what the law demanded.  But when I learned the truth, I realized I had broken the law and was a sinner, doomed to die.”  <br>  <br>  The way I read this Scripture – by itself – tells me that since I now know that I have sinned and broken God’s laws, I am doomed to die.  You know what?  I AM doomed to die.  But I am also blessed to live forever, thanks to the blood – the Saving Grace – of Jesus Christ.  <br>  <br>  Let’s go back to our original Scripture, Hebrews 6:4-8, but this time let’s read the first twelve verses of the chapter to better understand the message that the author is trying to convey.  The ninth verse alone undoes the conviction we receive from the fourth verse.  We see a gentle, loving person giving a very tender and calming statement – “Dear friends, even though we are talking like this, we really don't believe that it applies to you.”  If the author was not saying these things about his readers, who was he talking about?  I believe it was the Pharisees and Sadducees of those early Christian days.  These were the religious leaders and scholars who rejected the Lordship of Jesus.  Those were the people to whom it should have been obvious that Jesus was the Messiah.  They were learned in all the prophecies concerning the coming of the Lord.  But what did they do?  They held a mock trial and crucified their own Messiah!  Remember the reference to “re-crucifying” Christ?  No, our author is saying in the ninth verse that he had “salvation things” in mind for his readers.  By “re-crucifying” we should discover that to re-crucify the Lord, we have to first crucify Him.  To crucify Him, we have to hold Him up to public scrutiny and derision, participating fully in the public sacrilege.  To re-crucify Him, we have to do it again!<br>  <br>  We’re talking about hardened hearts here.  So what is a hardened heart?  I think the simplest definition would be the absence of a conscience.  No feelings of guilt.  No remorse.  Possibly, recognizing our sins for what they are but not caring about the consequences of them.  In my mind, I get a picture of a death row inmate “flipping off” the gallery at his execution, showing no concern regarding his sins or their repercussions.<br>  <br>  So my message is twofold.  First, so long as our consciences are troubled and we strive to overcome our sinful natures, we have hope.  Secondly, never doubt God’s love for us.  So long as we are alive, we have hope.  Don’t let the enemy persuade you that you are without hope.  So long as we breathe and strive to live God’s will, so long as we continue to repent of our sins, we have the hope of eternal life with Jesus.  Even that death-row inmate has salvation available to him – right up to the point of death.  Sadly, there IS an urgency in God’s message that so many people miss – if we keep putting off our salvation until tomorrow, God may decide – without our permission – not to let us have any more tomorrows.  That makes TODAY the day of choice to accept Jesus as your Risen Savior.|`|e1Ecc6pxaa	It is referring to those that are already saved and willfully turn away from the Lord...<br>  <br>  To those that believe in once saved always saved, think about this verse very carefully.<br>  <br>  "If you conquer until the end, I will not blot your name out of the Book of Life" (Revelation 3- Jesus)<br>  <br>  Notice the word IF...

It not only gives us something to look at concerning these verses, but we can check which translation you are looking at.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 4<br>  4 For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work." 5 And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest."<br>  <br>   6 It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience. 7 Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before:<br>     "Today, if you hear his voice,<br>        do not harden your hearts." 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.<br>  <br>  It goes back to the old message; God is to be our focus. People are caught in disobeying this. They begin to focus on other things. Christ is our rest. Jesus is our Sabbath, and we are "Sabbathing" when our trust is in Him.<br>  <br>  Joshua did not get that rest. Christ wasn't there yet. So that other day came when Christ came to earth and did what he did concerning providing for those who trust in him.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	That would be referring to the unpardonable sin of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hebrews 6:4-6<br>  4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, 5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, 6 if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.|`|622ea772914089a4e5db758f396fbb8eaa	The apostle Paul, as you can see from his wording, was trained by Gamaliel, a lawyer.  Verses 7 & 8 give you an illustration of what he's saying in verses 4-6.  In other words (I'll try to keep this short) if you receive God's holy spirit, then reject it by negative actions--producing thorns and thistles (or briers)--then you're of no use to Him, and He will reject you.  It's basically an encouragement to keep doing good, knowing God will not overlook or be forgetful of such acts.--verse 10|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Once you are saved you are "Sealed" with His Pardon!

History and several branches of science prove that no such thing has ever happened.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	Yes, it was real, and those that do not believe it because it sounds to "fanatastic" or "unscientific", I understand.  But after I investigated some of the theories (everything is a theory that can't be recreated in the laboratory) I realized that their is some interesting data out there to support a world wide flood.  When I add that with other data, meaning that I have investigated the bible in other areas, it confirmed to me again the bibles accuracy.  As a side note, Jesus spoke of the flood of Noah as well, and it is mentioned again regarding the last days and the indifference of people just before the flood, and the indifference of people before the return of Christ to the earth.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes it was|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Supposedly fossil records show a massive flood but that is all I have read about it.<br>  <br>  In many cultures and religions there seems to be some story of a great flood.

It is a book that conveys religious truth. When reading the Bible, we need to take into account that it's collection of books are like a library - we cannot read each and every book in the same manner. For example, we would not read "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" with the same attitude that we would read "A History of WWII". Same goes for the Bible. The majority of people's questions about the Bible would be resolved if people would take this thought into account upon their theological study.<br>  <br>  The Bible did not just fall down from heaven already printed. It IS God's word, but God did not simply tell the authors what to write, who in turn copied it down on paper. God left the authors the free will to write His Word with elements pertaining to their own time period. So, of course, things that make sense to someone living in 3000 B.C. would not be logical when read by someone living in 2000 A.D. It is still God's Word, however. People just need to take into account that the Bible's scientific and historical elements were based on the knowledge from THAT time period - not ours! Therefore, we cannot assume the scientific and historical elements to be necessarily true!<br>  <br>  For example, let's take the ages of some of the famous Old Testament figures. The Bible states that some of these people lived to be several hundred years old! However, we know that this is not possible. This misunderstanding most likely came from a gap in the calendar system between our times and theirs. We follow the Gregorian Calendar, which is a revised version of the Julian Calendar. The inventors of both of these calendars lived long after the Old Testament was written. Therefore, we KNOW that the calendar system used during the Old Testament wasn't the same as today. Thus, with the application of a little logic and reason, we know that the age of Old Testament figures was not actually several hundred years old on the scale of today's calendar system!<br>  <br>  The Bible conveys religious truth. Not historical and/or scientific fact. If the Bible was meant for science and history, we'd use it in school classrooms!|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	yeah there is ton's of evidence, archaeologists have found, armor, chariot wheels, horses hooves, weapons, and skeletons of soldiers.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Of course not....I aways ask questions about that to see how the blind believers react by telling them that there no way a man could put 300000 animals on a boat in a week as it says.

The purpose of the flood was to eliminate violence or possibly something worse (the people may have had a disease God wanted wiped out) Noah and his family was on the boat with all their farm animals and those in the nearby forests. At that time people had not spread thru out the entire world so there was no need to flood the entire world. As far as Noah could see it was the enite world because he was on the ship 377 days and never saw land. (although he didn't have a window for it) Several of the ancient writings of Kings refer to the time before the great flood...|`|6pkNeswAaa	No! we would be inbred!|`|xhHxhai5aa	Short Answer: No<br>  <br>  Long Answer: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>  <br>  There's not enough water on this planet to flood it completely.

It wouldn't be structurally sound and would collapse under its own mass.  Oh, and finding EVERY animal on the planet and keeping them fed and clean for weeks?  Hell, they'd have to work around hte clock just to keep them fed, or to sweep up all the poop.<br>  <br>  Noah's ark never happened, dude.  Plain and simple.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	I know some true believers who THINK it is literally true. Personally, I see no sense in any god selecting so few and then effectively orchestrating a "do-over". I thought god was not in the business of making mistakes. So, what is the point of killing SO MANY and saving SO FEW? I do not want any part of a god who would be so spiteful, vindictive and petulant as to kill off so many innocents. Or were ALL of the living things that DIED from 40 days and nights of rain flooding the world BAD and deserved to die? Were there NO innocents other than the few on the ark?  If you believe the story, ALL of the plants, animals and people were BAD, and god only saved the few GOOD. My true believer friends could NEVER explain the rationale of why a god would organize a do-over... AND on top of that, if god is so all knowing, so all powerful, WHY rely on Noah to do anything? For that matter, why does god need a middleman, a priest or shaman to speak FOR god? Why doesn't god simply use a little of the all knowing, all powerfullness to just tell me himself? Why rely on a clueless 3rd party to spread the word? Are all of us common people all so stupid we have to have god explained TO us? And if so, does that not also say that god has failed to spread his own word himself?  Each and every religion CLAIMS to be the one true faith and have the word of god. OK, so explain to me exactly HOW can that be the truth? If one religion really DOES have the one true god, then what do all the others have? Isn't believing in the wrong god just as bad as no god at all? Isn't it truth that your scripture says that only believers in YOUR faith are saved and all others are doomed to eternal torment? Why does any god need to force belief through FEAR of retribution? ALL of this, with no tangible proof of any kind? YMMV...|`|0L1hXyKoaa	Kinda<br>  <br>  There was a great flood, but it didn't cover the whole world.|`|Z7kZdBkXaa	There have been searches for it and some physical evidence supporting the story has been reportedly found.<br>  Here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searches_for_Noah%27s_Ark" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searches_fo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=40060" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTI...</a>|`|wukXoRCMaa	the author's of the bible just took an even that might have occurred and put their own twist on it<br>  <br>  it's kind of like a lot of these movies that are based on true stories but their events greatly stray from the "true" story|`|peDJSnQPaa	nah cause the ark couldn't have been big enough for the animals to fit (they didn't have the materials needed), and there is no evidence of a flood all over the world|`|a8IslxsQaa	There is absolutely no evidence that anything in the bible is true.

The original message, coming in response to a question of whether it was lawful for Jews to pay taxes to Caesar, gives rise to multiple possible interpretations about whether it is desirable for the Christian to submit to earthly authority.

There's nothing Godly about that.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	RUBBISH yet again....I can see you have never been to Saudi what a load...And yes I would be more than happy to live under Sharia Law because I DO have a clue what it is and know its nothing to be feared like you want to represent.

You seem to be confusing him being able to go to Saudi Arabia with him not being able to visit Mecca big difference. Why do people insist on talking about things they have no knowledge off? Honestly your only embarrassing yourselves...<br>  <br>  Sorry but when in any country you have to follow the laws of the country.

Not me that's for sure, could care less. Solution dont ever visit a country with Sharia law then! Who is asking you too? Stay where you are and let us who are happy with Sharia and feel "FREE" living with Sharia to do as we like and live there, got it?<br>  <br>  Sorry think you just dropped your ball... Game over? You didnt even make it to the court mate!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Saudi Legal System"<br>  5. Laws are based on the Muslim Holy Book, the Quran.  The system is often known as “sharia”.  Punishments for some offences are harsh by British standards.  But the Saudis understand that the ways of non-Muslims are different from their own and they will not generally interfere with what foreigners do quietly, privately and discretely.  But foreigners who take advantage of this to break the law are running serious risks. The Saudis are jealous of their reputation of having a well-ordered society. They will not allow foreigners to put it at risk."<br>  <a href="http://ukinsaudiarabia.fco.gov.uk/en/help-for-british-nationals/living-in-saudi-arabia/" rel="nofollow">http://ukinsaudiarabia.fco.gov.uk/en/hel...</a><br>  Get some perspective would you?|`|qpcYYWlIaa	Extremists anywhere give their culture or religion a bad name. Saudi Arabia has moved a few inches towards progress, but they have many miles to go. Aside from their living standards the Saudis are not much different than the Talibans. Look what they have done to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the name of Islam. <br>  <br>  They misconstrue Islam. It is depriving half of their Muslim population of their God given rights. I do not consider what the Saudis or the Talibans are doing Islamic at all. It is a culture that time forgot.<br>  <br>  A woman in Saudi Arabia cannot even get a ride in a car unless she is with an adult male relative or her husband. What if she has neither? Those people are sick and this is why they are so backward.

Does the knee feel hot to touch or appear swollen?  Don't rule out a trip to your local Immediate Care in the morning if this keeps up.  Take care and keep us posted.|`|acaJSqW6aa	It does sound like the nerves but then you may want to elevate the leg and get all pressure off it and if you are wearing anything tight on your leg remove that. Also you may want to use an analgesic cream topically and see if that helps. I'm not sure if heat would help or just compound the problem. Could try that for a short period but take great care with any heat.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	It almost sounds like something involving a nerve.  I wish I could be more help.

bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	It happens.  It's difficult for any heterosexual (or homosexual) to understand bisexuality.  So if you're mom is straight, she probably just doesn't understand.<br>  <br>  Just let her know where you stand, and leave it alone.  It doesn't matter what she thinks.  If you happen to fall in love with a woman and bring her home to meet your mom, simply tell your mother that she can't be shocked because you have been honest with her.|`|1b4ea77c10a26133d0a52fc258a6bbcfaa	Don't listen to her.

Her mother still thinks that our relationship and her recent crush on another woman is 'just a phase' and she 'hasn't met the right guy yet'.  However men do not appeal to her at all.  I on the other hand have been on both sides of the fence.  I personally don't look at the gender of the person I'm with.  I'm more into who they are in general.  It doesn't matter if they are man or woman.<br>  <br>  You may have been traumatized by your ex-bf but if you were traumatized by your ex-gf... would that make you straight?  What matters is what you want out of your life.  Your mother may not think that you are 'bi' but it's a choice that most people don't seem to understand how it is possible to be attracted to both sexes.<br>  <br>  You will find that right someone for you someday...  And it seems like regardless you have your mind open to who they are... regardless of their gender.  Good luck|`|qFnlFHshaa	i'm a lesbian and sometimes i feel the same way towards straight people/bi people/etc but its only because i really cannot comprehend men/woman relationships or that sort of attraction. we're only human, what we don't understand we try to ignore or pass off as a farce. its only natural. i've been on both sides of the argument i just try to keep in  mind how i feel when my sexuality comes into question and attempt to apply how i feel when that happens to the situations-tolerance is always key|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	My sister who is a year older than me constantly tells me im not a lesbian. That im confused. But I think she only says that for one because in her eyes it's wrong  and she couldnt imagine being a lesbian or bi for that matter. And for two because she's a minister. I told her she cant tell me what im not. I know who I am and what I am no matter what or how she thinks. Ima always be me. Ima always be a LESBIAN!!!|`|R45yHlYjaa	Ok this may sound horrible but your mum might be trying to deny the fact that your bi. Sorry.

It's your life to live.<br>  *hugs*|`|SLAEzvnMaa	It's not up to your mother to decide your sexuality for you.  It sounds to me like you've pretty much got your stuff together. Maybe your mom's just in her own denial about who you really are.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	You're Mom might be right.<br>  Or you might truly be bisexual.<br>  <br>  Only you can answer that though.<br>  <br>  It goes like this:<br>  <br>  If you truly feel a sexual attraction to woman and men than you are bi.<br>  If you don't really feel attracted to woman but feel only 'safe' with them, you are hiding behind the label and in that case your Mom is correct.<br>  <br>  Just be aware of your feelings and make note of how you feel before you act on your impulses.  Ask yourself is this authentic or not.<br>  <br>  Sorry your first bf was such a jerk.<br>  I believe in karma- he'll get his.|`|z0kSza6Eaa	How on earth would your mother have any real idea of whom you are attracted to sexually?  I can't think of anything more personal.
gOF1wJLFaa	Yes. And he/she should. They should take a stand. That person should let people know that they are offended by it. <br>  <br>  We should be able to make a pledge to our country without having to act as if we think it's blessed by a fictional being.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Technically they can't be forced to say the pledge.  You might as well force them, though, because a kid who sits out is going to get pounded at recces.  Then the other kids will tell their parents about the weird kid who doesn't say the pledge, the parents will say horrible things about people other religions/non-religions, making sure to pass the hatred on to the next generation, the teacher will be biased against that student, etc.<br>  <br>  Until we take religion out of schools, non-Christian kids are going to be treated like $hit.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Sure can.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Yes.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Sure.

It all depends on how much flack the kid wants to put up with for the sake of constitutional freedoms.  Personally, I consider pledging allegiance to an emblem to be the definiton of fascism.  I'd prefer pledging to the Constitution or the People.|`|4ea33fec9bff6a9fd9c0e86d64167d2daa	God gave everyone free will|`|3GAiVmEAaa	That depends on the teacher. You should at least stand with everyone else out of respect.  You could also just not say "under God" which people would likely not notice anyways. <br>  <br>  I had one teacher in high school that would let people sit it out if they wrote a short essay to show that you had a real reason for it. If you really want to protest it by not standing just talk to them and possibly offer to do something similar.|`|Wmxpi9Amaa	Sure. You don't even have to say the pledge if you DO believe in god. No one HAS to. I usually say "under god" if I'm not really thinking about it, but if I fee like it, I just omit those words. I don't really think it's a big deal to say it, but to be expected to say it, and for it to assume all Americans are inherently theists is inappropriate. So I think it should be tken out, but that there are far more pressing needs.<br>  <br>  I still wonder why it's such a big deal if an American flag touches the ground, but not if a homeless American sleeps on the ground...<br>  <br>  I'm a question deviant!|`|p18BmlIxaa	I remember when I was in first or second grade, there were a couple of kids in my class who refused to say the pledge of allegiance, for whatever reason.  Nobody had a problem with it.<br>  <br>  When I say it, I just omit "under God".|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Anyone can refuse to say the pledge for any reason. I don't say it because, to me, pledging allegiance to an inanimate object (a flag) is idolatry.|`|1GZ8nrjyaa	A person can refuse to say the Pledge of Allegiance for any reason he or she chooses--any reason at all.<br>  <br>  Some reasons for that choice may be better or worse than others, but it is an Inalienable Human Right not to be forced to give one's allegiance to anybody or anything.<br>  <br>  Personally, I take very seriously the religious obligation to give absolute allegiance to no one and no thing except God.  So I will stand quietly while the Pledge of Allegiance is said.  I will not put my hand on my heart, either.  My heart belongs to God, not the State.<br>  <br>  Although I understand God to be a real personality, and some people do not believe in God at all, there are still others who view God as a non-existent idea that is still useful--sort of like the imaginary number "i," which is defined as the square root of negative 1 (and thus an impossibility) but is still essential for performing some mathematical equations.<br>  <br>  That will sound lame to some, I know--but when the State historically has been one of the most frequent enslavers of people, there needs to be something greater than the State, but also greater than oneself, to which a person can give his or her loyalty.|`|xelkbdbdaa	The pledge of allegiance is just that. It's an act of patriotism. It is not a blanket confession of belief in God. There are people who are working to take God's name from this pledge. This is a tradition based on American heritage. It doesn't specify what god is being prayed to, in particular. Most Americans say this pledge from many different religions and cultures. Therefore, the pledge itself is ambiguous. I don't see how it makes a difference, one way or the other. It is clearly your choice to make that pledge.|`|E07VAMNMaa	yes|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	They could, but if  you don't believe in God, what's the big deal ? I grew up with many atheist who didn't believe in God, but they weren't like the militant atheist today who make a stink out of everything religious, they said the pledge, never complained about it, and it didn't seem to hurt them . God bless.|`|Tx2Uk0KVaa	Yes.  No law states that the Pledge of Alligience is mandatory.  <br>  <br>  I won't say it because it was written by a radical Socialist and the original salute for it was the Nazi-like right arm extended.  The Christians got a hold of it and forced "Under God" on us, adding their own little spin on things.<br>  <br>  The Pledge has a very questionable history.|`|AA12226718	Original version, "One nation, indivisible"<br>  <br>  Atheists are not militant, nor do we want attention. We only want the same freedoms that every other person in this country has. To believe (or not believe) in whatever god they choose. By requiring a child to recite the pledge with the word "god" in it, you are doing the old back door brainwash technique - get 'em to say it enough and they'll believe in it! I believe in my country. I do not believe in god.|`|a8IslxsQaa	Yes, that kid has a right to. Unfortunately the United States is full of religious nut-jobs that will treat like garbage any person who does not wish to recite the pledge of allegiance.<br>  <br>  When I was a child I used to recite the pledge of allegiance, but not speak the "under god" part.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  For one, President Adams (if I recall correctly) said outright that America was not founded on Christianity... so saying they HAVE to because this is a "Christian nation" is false. Secondly, the words "under God" weren't originally in the Pledge, so it'd be perfectly accurate to drop the words altogether.<br>  <br>  Of course, I myself am a Satanist and I had no issue with the pledge... for the most part, anyhow. I'd either stand and just not say anything, or just drop out the words "under god". :P But to each their own.|`|yQDxgLBPaa	The district I went to school in if a child doesn't believe in saying the pledge because of there religion or not believing in god. Every morning when everyone else said it. They just request that student stand up when everyone else is saying the pledge but that certain doesn't have to put he/she hand on there heart or say it.|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	Absolutely.  It's called freedom of Speech and Freedom of Religion.  It applies to ALL American citizens no matter what their age.<br>  <br>  Also the refusal to say the pledge doesn't have to be because the word G-d is in it but because it could be viewed by some faiths as a pledge to a false god and not our heavenly father.<br>  <br>  And for those that won't say the pledge because it contains the word/references to G-d I suggest that you do not use our nations money either as it contains the words 'In G-d we trust'.|`|jkW2b55Qaa	I never understood why you would pledge to a flag anyway.  It's the principles upon which the country was founded, and for which the country stands that are important.<br>  <br>  I'm not loyal to the flag or any other symbol.  I am loyal to the principles.|`|dR9UyP6naa	If he/she wishes to, they can.  There's no law stating they have to say it.  For that matter, I'd like to see the pledge back to its original form before 1954 when the words "under god" were added because of McCarthyism.|`|AA11336384	I omit the God part, and replace it with Obama. Did the same with Bush. Technically, not everyone is governed by God, but the president is, whether or not we like it.|`|5KZZtGnpaa	That's stupid, the pledge doesn't tell you what god their talking about it could be a tree for all anybody cares. God is up to your interpretation of what god is. To me it's energy. So who cares.|`|jBIotay5aa	Most definitely. If  you feel that you being made to do something you don't believe in you're being oppressed.|`|QppGjrfhaa	Well what I would do if I were you (I assume you're asking this regarding yourself) than just omit the parts mentioning god,that's what I do,besides that whether or not you believe in god "under god" SHOULD NOT be in the pledge of allegiance it just isn't right.<br>  <br>  A little history for you. Did you know the "Under god" portion of the pledge was added in 1954 when congress passed a bill to put it in there? the original pledge read "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands; one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." And was as you can see much more friendly version and in my honest opinion it should STILL be that way.|`|wt42KeeXaa	Im Australian, so I dont have to put up the the retarded religious stuff you have in America<br>  <br>  .....You yanks are weird|`|7MtjF084aa	yea and some kid at my high school got in trouble for it.... i think his parents sues the school..|`|AFObCLvZaa	Of Course I Think Everyone Has The Right To Not Say The Pledge Of Allegiance If They Don't Believe In God

This is a fundamental foundational moral teaching of the Church.<br>  <br>  The step-father being accused of rape and being probably guilty of rape is a separate issue. He has committed a sin as well as those murdering these two precious children. God is the final judge of all and he will be punished by God's justice if not by man.

4sUek7ugaa	Yes, I do.  I know several Quakers.  <br>  <br>  Was there more to that question?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The Quaker sect started in England, around the time North America was being colonized.  The main belief is that humans can have direct experience of the divine and don't require the mediation of clergy.   At a Quaker meeting, everyone sits quietly and reads the Bible or some other inspirational text until someone feels moved by the spirit to get up and speak.  All members are equal.<br>  <br>  Quakers are, as a rule, pacifists.  Early in the 20th century there was a split within the church between those whose pacifism was absolute and those who believed that there were times when taking up arms was justified.  My friends happen to be part of the absolute pacifist group and regularly participate in antiwar demonstrations.<br>  <br>  The Puritans, who moved to America to escape religious persecution, lost no time in persecuting Quakers once some of that group took up residence in Massachusetts Bay.

Ron Hubbard. The organization, by means of Hubbard’s self created psychotherapy technique called “Dianetics”, claims to be able to help rid members of any & all mental constraints including but not limited to emotional scarring (from this & "past" lives) due to "engrams" (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind), psychological disorders & chemical imbalances (the solution is to convince members that these things don't actually exist) & drug dependence (including legally prescribed psychopharmaceuticals which counteract the effects of psychological disorders Scientologists believe to be nonexistent). Their “treatment” of substance abuse includes little more than massive, often dangerous doses of vitamins and unhealthy extended sessions in a sauna. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics#Scientific_evaluation_and_criticisms" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics#S...</a> <br>  Dianetics review: <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2005/06/28/dianetics/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812852,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/detox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/deto...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&columns/feature.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&column...</a> <br>  <br>  Scientology is most certainly NOT a religion. In fact, one of the only reasons they enjoy "tax exempt status" on religious ground in the United States is because they bullied the IRS into a "deal" through extremely aggressive barratry (which is the offense of persistently instigating groundless lawsuits) against said government agency & its officials, & arranged to drop all 2,500 frivolous lawsuits only when an "agreement" was reached. In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. It was an all-out WAR that Scientology had waged against the IRS, & was even described as such by Scientology's "CEO", David Miscavige, in his 1993 speech to the International Association of Scientologists. <br>  <a href="http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fedtax-l/msg00445.html" rel="nofollow">http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/nytimes/nyt-irs-030997.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-away.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/irs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...</a> <br>  <br>  The official Scientology organization is composed of a number of “levels”. One begins as a “preclear” & works their way up. One must purchase virtually every service crucial to advancement directly from the "church" & at staggering prices. "Auditing", for example, is purchased in 12? hour blocks, costing anywhere from $200-$750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions. Basically, Scientology claims to possess exclusive knowledge of the path to religious redemption & then charges obscene amounts of money for every tiny incremental step towards this end.

Scientologists believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are "Body Thetans") were captured, brainwashed & released; they then attached themselves to our ancestors (and according to Scientology’s belief in Thetan immortality, they also attached to us during “past lives”) & cause many of our mental & physical ills to this day.

It doesn’t recognize legitimate conditions like autism, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ANY neurological disorder / chemical imbalance at all, & the “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from members (often with harmful & deadly results). The “Church” blames psychiatry for the Holocaust, as well as school shootings & even September 11th. It’s been suggested that Hubbard’s vehement opposition was born of the psychiatric community’s rejection of his “tech” as a valid treatment method, but it’s also possible that Hubbard chose psychiatry as a scapegoat. Organizations like Scientology are notorious for villainizing a specific out-group because their “stand against the enemy” fosters cohesion within said organization, & psychiatry was an effective rallying point considering many people already distrust & oppose the mental health profession. <br>  <a href="http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/usa-scientology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/usa-scie...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=3137&IssueNum=136" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id...</a> <br>  <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://perkinstragedy.org" rel="nofollow">http://perkinstragedy.org</a> <br>  <br>  L.

Several books & articles present facts which flatly contradict these church-published accounts (links to free online copies of these books & articles are provided below), showing conclusively that he was NOT the brilliant, accomplished figure revered by Scientologists. During his autopsy, the sedative Vistaril? was present in his body, which several of his assistants would later attest was only one of many psychiatric & pain medications Hubbard ingested over the years.

It bullies all known critics, opponents, “enemies”, etc, often through malicious litigation & character assassination.

Ron Hubbard declared:<br>  <br>  "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion"<br>  <br>  The principles of the group that are told to outsiders and new recruits ARE good. We have the power to better ourselves, we need to do good in the world. We need to tap into our higher creativity, etc. They have to draw people in with good stuff.<br>  <br>  The website below has a lot of great information. You will never get the information FROM Scientology sites, because they have layers of things that are allowed to be known. You have to pay them LOTS of money before they let you in on the big "secrets." Xenu, for example, is not supposed to be known by anyone under level... 10 or something, which is thousands of dollars.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to know is the "Fair Game" policy. Here's the quote from the manual:<br>  <br>  Hubbard defined the "penalties" for an individual deemed to be in a "Condition of Enemy":<br>  <br>  ENEMY — SP Order. Fair game. May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.[7]<br>  <br>  During Operation Freakout, they bombed buildings and framed a woman who was writing a book critical of the Church.

(It calls itself as 'applied religious technology'.)<br>  <br>  This is what actually goes on in Scientology: the Scientologist goes through all the traumatic events in their life while holding the terminals of a meter. Another Scientologist - the 'auditor' - watches the meter while this is going on. When the Scientologist has 'handled' the events in their life, the treatment then goes on to pre-birth life. Then past lives. Only 3% of them get that far. 'Dianetics' was originally a secular therapy, but after it was denounced, its founder (L Ron Hubbard) relaunched it as a religion, with sermons, services and weddings. Hubbard had designs on the world itself so Scientology was designed to fit side by side with existing religions, although it doesn't really.<br>  <br>  Scientology has been accused of being a cult. It certainly uses cult-like tactics, such as having levels that you have to pay to advance through, as much as several hundred thousand to reach the higher ones. Also, the church has a deserved reputation for breaking up families, especially if some fanily members do not approve of Scientology. Remember in the last paragraph I mentioned 'pre-birth traumas'? I mean the creation of false memories, of child abuse, even false memories of abuse as a foetus or an embryo. The book 'Dianetics', which is the first book you read in Scientology, has a long description of a woman recalling being squashed in the womb while her parents were having sex. Need I say more!<br>  <br>  If you still think Scientology is for you I would also add that the people who are most anti-Scientology are former Scientologists, which must tell you something.|`|AA10985325	Here’s a factual description for you (From a Scientologist):<br>  <br>  Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By “applied” is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.<br>  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.<br>  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .<br>  The dictionary definition that applies:<br>  <br>  Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.<br>  <br>  The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.<br>  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless “made” good.<br>  <br>  The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individual’s understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.<br>  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .<br>  <br>  How this result is achieved is the “technology” of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.<br>  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .<br>  Scientology’s closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.<br>  <br>  L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this. <br>  He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientology’s Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.<br>  <br>  The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.<br>  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:<br>  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.<br>  2. People find it interesting.<br>  3. People find it works.<br>  4. People pass it along to others.<br>  5. It grows.<br>  <br>  This is just an overview.<br>  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures.

Whatever it is, it isn't cheap. An hour of Scientology counseling can cost hundreds of dollars. Some former members say they were required to spend more that $250,000 on a never-ending series of classes and counseling lessons. In 1991 Time magazine published a cover story on the group . "Scientology: The Cult of Greed," shouted the cover headline. Inside, investigative reporter Richard Behar called the organization a depraved yet thriving enterprise and showed how the growing Dianetics empire squeezed millions from believers worldwide. As Behar wrote, "The Church of Scientology. . . portrays itself as a religion. In reality, the church is a hugely profitable global racket that survives by intimidating members and critics in a Mafia-like manner." Until his death in 1986, reclusive founder L. Ron Hubbard oversaw all Scientology activities with guru-like control from an offshore fleet of ships. Before Hubbard founded Scientology he was a struggling science fiction writer. People who knew him in the 1950s claim they once heard him say that if a person really wanted to make money, he would start religion. In 1950 he published "Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health." It was an instant success. The book was Hubbard's psycho-therapeutic alternative to the techniques of modern mainstream psychiatry. But when the medical community responded with alarm, Hubbard transformed his theories into a religion, with Dianetics as the scripture of his new movement. The Church of Scientology was founded in Washington, D.C., in 1955. Hubbard sought tax-exempt status and freedom from governmental interference for his organization. Scientology was eventually granted tax-exempt status in the United States, but it is still denied such benefits in Germany and other European countries. Its recognition as a church saves the organization millions of dollars in taxes. In his 1952 book entitled "Scientology: A History of Man" Hubbard even adapted the words of Jesus as found in Matthew 11:5 to describe his new teaching: "This is useful knowledge. With it the blind again see, the lame walk, the ill recover, the insane become sane and the sane become saner. By its use the thousand abilities Man has sought to recover become his once more." Since then, Scientology has blossomed. The organization claims millions of members in dozens of countries, though some defectors say that current membership may be less that seven hundred thousand. The church reports that more than sixteen million copies of "Dianetics" have been sold. Hubbard's reputation as an explorer, science fiction writer, and para-botanist enlarged to make him the worldwide spokesman for this rapid growing cult. Still, some of Scientology's teachings sound like the far-fetched story lines from one of Hubbard's many sci-fi novels. In 1985 one of the many lawsuits brought against the organization by former members resulted in the release of secret Scientology teachings to the general public. Unlike many Christian groups who try to give away Bibles, Scientology closely guards its scriptures. One of the many lawyers referred to the group's teachings and techniques as trade secrets. Here's how an Associated Press story summarized the group's ideas: "Seventy-five million years ago, Earth was called Teegeeach and was among ninety planets ruled by Xemu, who spread his evil by thermonuclear bombs... Xemu, attempting to solve overpopulation problems, destroyed selected inhabitants of the planets and implanted the seeds of aberrant behavior in their spirits to effect future generations of mankind.... Being from the planet were taken to at least ten volcanoes on Earth where H-bombs far more powerful than any in existence today were detonated, destroying the beings but freeing their spirits, called thetans.... The thetans were trapped in a compound of frozen alcohols and during a 36-day period, Xemu implanted in them the seeds of aberrant behavior for generations to come."|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  I think that Scientology is a joke.

My boyfriend does it to me all the time, and i do it to him...it drives him crazy. lol but its no big deal, some guys aren't as concerned with texting as girls are.|`|0GEcJFYNaa	i think he is into you he could just be really busy or something you should talk to him about it next time he does respond to your texts or calls you hopefully he isn't doing things with other people and i probably shouldn't be saying that but sometimes you have to think of all the possibilities and that is possible seeing as he doesn't always respond to you|`|JsMd6PrCaa	no of course not!<br>  like think about it, if he didn't like you then he wouldn't spend all that time and effort talking to you.<br>  <br>   People get distracted, phones die, teachers give tons of homework, etc there are all sorts of reasons that he might not be able to respond to every text you send|`|qxewMAZoaa	No it means he's efff-ing busy gosh<br>  you know guy's dont have all the time in the world<br>  wat about skool nd work and sport practice|`|SOqxJkobaa	I would say yea. if he was he'd put in the effort. <br>  <br>  He's just not that into you is a very good movie by the way. and makes some good points|`|AXh7WLSJaa	Haha, or maybe he gets too nervous to answer right away..|`|5LWq12epaa	it could, or it could mean that he is busy|`|QNG0zkQRaa	Its sounds like your looking for a guys answer, but I thought I would put  2 cents in anyway. <br>  <br>  It all depends, are you asking a particular question when you text him, or are you just making some kind of a statement (which doesn't really need a response). Sometimes people don't always see there text right away, I know when i'm in work or in school  my phone is on silence and I sometimes don't get to see a text until 10 hours later and by then sometimes its pointless responding. There is a possibility that hes not that into you, to be sure the next time you text him end it with "get back at me when you get a chance" or something similar to that. If he responses then you can get a better sense of how into you he is. I dunno hopefully that was helpful.<br>  <br>  Also he may not know how to text, sounds crazy but my ex-boyfriend didn't know how to text and didn't care to learn how.|`|8lHsOVxqaa	No. That is not true. And I really hope you aren't going by that book, and the movie.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, they cannot get to the text, and sometimes, some people don't always like to text much. It may also charge him to do so, so he may be keeping his texts down to a minimal.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't over analyze too much though. He calls, so that apparently tells you he is into you. If he wasn't into you at all, he'd ignore you altogether.|`|S3Mqe64Aaa	well...that depends. what does he call you as a name..by your name ? does he flirt ? does he say your pretty and stuff. if he flirts and says your pretty and calls you cute names...then he likes you <3 but if he's not responding to your texts, then he might be busy (:|`|VwDIeYteaa	I do that to the person I like, so the answer would be yeah! Sometimes we just like to keep them waiting so they like us more when we do txt them back.|`|eTm9uLqyaa	He probably is trying not to seem excited that you are texting him.. He is trying to play it cool.|`|gM3tw8Ifaa	maybe he just doesnt check his phone much and only replies to the most resent when he does check.|`|3a9e3bdd92746af79a33fa3853b86c70aa	He's probably just busy or doesn't notice his phone going out. calm down. its okay!!!|`|7oiBFIguaa	Uhh...OR it can mean he didn't have his phone on him? Or his phone is OFF.|`|29hxVukYaa	no he might just be busy or something else.|`|zDsW8O0waa	no. he just is busy somtimes.|`|vDVnqhj9aa	yes.......that is just the way they are and i don't now why.|`|mVSC9aKoaa	no, he does not respond only when he is with another girl friend.|`|1JSblCBsaa	Obviously, they are people...<br>  They fall asleep, forget their phone, have to do something, run out of things to say, think you have finished speaking, etc etc.

Have never been more than two hundred square miles from where they were born or went to school. Anything beyond the two hundred square miles seems like another country to them.<br>  <br>  My country Australia is the worlds largest Island which is the same size as the United States only 20 million people and has no boarding countries. Where we can drive to, or where people can illegally enter or walk into our country. <br>  <br>  My country is totally surrounded by oceans and seas,  the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean. the Southern Ocean. the Timor and Arafura seas, the Tasman Sea, and the Coral Sea.<br>  <br>  I don't see my country being the world as at school we are taught about all the countries of the world. Also our parents encourage us to globally travel and see the real world. Realistically the USA isn't really a large country. I have driven from the west coast to the east coast in four days, with a few stops along the way. It's approx the same distance driving from Sydney to Perth. <br>  <br>  The State I live in Australia, New South Wales is over five times the size of Texas, in the USA. My state has snowfields, thousands of beaches, islands, mountains, resorts, large modern cities, towns and country towns, gold and ghost towns, deserts etc, etc, I don't see it as the world.<br>  <br>  Get your passport, check out the world outside the USA world is great and truly nothing like the USA world.|`|W4BvABL6aa	Americans seeing the world as America?

NwXnzARwaa	Homosexuality is not a racial classification; it is a sexual orientation classification. <br>  <br>  Derogatory terms are offensive, whether applied to a person due to their race or their sexual orientation.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	Of course homosexuality is not a race.  Race is determined based upon genetic characteristics.  And homosexuality is found in all races.  Other than that, I am a bit unclear about what your are questioning.|`|8Vz9JF7paa	hahahhaa no its not a race and calling someone gay is not like calling somone a "n" word... it's just like name calling because the people who do it are trying to be cruel so they stil hsouldnt do it but no not a race|`|AK0xIxeQaa	its not a race.  its a sexual orientation.  and saying you're gay is different than the n word.  but fa---- is as bad as that word to gays.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	No, its a condition.|`|Vz7j7AOqaa	No, it's a disease.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Confuse? LOL<br>  I bet you would be|`|hQNmgdQ7aa	haha, i dont think so.|`|cUR7JyDFaa	Technically, it's not a race. I personally see it as a race, because it expresses a way of life. Mexican's are proud of their ways, so why can't gay people be proud of theirs? IT all depends on you you think about it.|`|OqiFoJFraa	it isnt a race<br>   but its still offencive when you use the word "gay" to describe something lame....|`|8Ba2YwO7aa	its not a race its more of a life style that people choose|`|qFnlFHshaa	why not if a man can marry a dog (happened in maine) then why can't we be considered a race|`|EwUcmfoFaa	no|`|AA12373166	They are sexual orientations|`|0lnamekJaa	"Gay" isn't like the N-word... That is silly...<br>  <br>  NO WORD should be used to demean another human for being who they were born.<br>  <br>  Being gay is as much of a choice as being straight... But since ANY form of "Difference" is used to torture your peer group in high school... The word, it seems, needed to be banned to stop the cruel and inhuman treatment of those that are either Out or have mannerisms that may make others think they are 'gay'.<br>  <br>  It is sad that it has come this far...|`|UV6osJh8aa	Variant sexuality is found in every culture and/or ethnic group.<br>  Wherever people exist, there are heterosexuals, homosexuals and bisexuals.<br>  <br>  No, gay is not a bad word.  I am not ashamed of it.  I am gay.  I am GAY.  Not like the "n word."|`|NeOVXJcXaa	..what? No, no, those are orientations, nothing to do with races.<br>  <br>  As for using "gay" as an insult, and also the "n" word, it's all about context, context, contest. For example, if you're pissed off at someone and you go "jesus i hate you you gay f****" that's just as insulting as gong "christ I hate you n*****"<br>  <br>  Being gay isn't an insult, and it's stupid when people try to use it as one.<br>  When they do use it in a hateful way, I take offense to it, sure, because being gay is NOT a bad thing, and I'm insulted that everyone thinks it's so insulting.<br>  <br>  Whenever someone says "that's gay!" or "you're gay!" I want to grab the nearest guy (preferably them, ahahahaha) and make out with them in front of their face, cause that'd be hilarious. and awkward.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually I witnessed something similar once. I was going to class, minding my own business, when a group of loud boys ahead were joking around and stuff, saying stupid **** like "lol that's gay" blahblahblah, but I didn't care, and then some random guy out of NOWHERE goes up to one of them and kisses him, and runs off. all of them are just STUNNED.

He is beyond what we can see, and He is there whether you realize it or not. He is not there literally, but His spirit is. God listens to your prayers, but He has to make them work for everyone in your life. He is silent because in the Bible, it says that we must have faith in order for things to happen for us. Not everything is going to go the way that you want them to, but He will make things happen for the long run.|`|G4SVG7tKaa	God is silent because he doesn't exist.

They are in it for the money and for notariety.<br>  <br>  <br>  James 1: 12 - 15<br>  <br>  Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which GOD promised to those who continue loving him. When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. <br>  <br>  2 Peter 3: 8 - 10<br>  <br>  "However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with GOD as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. GOD is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.

I have not one single regret about it.  If narrow-minded, judgmental people consider that being a 'slut,' so be it.

And, for the answer to your curiosity, I'm straight and would NEVER date a male, regardless of their name.|`|ZfV2PDhWaa	No, but that would be interesting lol ^^|`|WNIL4sLiaa	Yes. And we're still friends with fringe benefits.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	No|`|M1u6fdZCaa	That would be kind of cool!|`|6w7FKrlfaa	yeah didn't last long tho... catherine and kathryn|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	That would be SO weird. lol|`|8Vz9JF7paa	umm no but my mates are Kat and Cait ... close and a mouthfull lol|`|SLAEzvnMaa	Actually, yes I did once. She was waiting on us one night at a restaurant, & we were flirting like crazy. I noticed that she did have the same name, but I didn't mention that right off the bat. When she brought the check, I gave her my card. When she came back from cashing me out, she goes, "We have the same name. That's pretty exciting." I responded, "What would really be exciting is if I left here with your phone number." We dated for a year.|`|v4isCHzvaa	No way that'd be too strange!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4kqvnQtUaa	No, But my friend James refuses to because he doesn't want to be in bed & the other James is yelling Ohh James, My friend thinks that the other James would be talking about himself. & not my friend lol. I can see his logic though, But it is a bit of a strange one.|`|fgxajTiBaa	No but I have had that awful thought before. I honestly don't know, even if I liked the person A LOT if I could date someone with my name. One of the few downfulls of being a lesbian. :-p

4aveC2aaaa	no, gifts do not come for free. if it is not bought, then something is given up for the other to get a gift. ehh <br>  <br>  being happy is very important. if you find someone who will make you happy, then that person is a gift his/herself|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  probebly.......<br>  .....but the responsibiltes that some gifts bring may not be so "free"<br>  such as the gift of life.......<br>  <br>  Peace.<br>  <br>  <br>  @Sina (good)<br>  <br>  &His Family<br>  <br>  (PBUH&HF) means "Peace Be Upon Him & His Family"......|`|Eeo6HPvuaa	Happiness is a gift as its self.|`|4sc7bMbkaa	yes your internal satisfaction is the blessing of Allah!!<br>  and gift is not free<br>  instead its priceless|`|NlQhkgFCaa	A Muslim is always content with whatever Allah provides for him|`|iUL0GU3paa	i agree with muslim soul =) stay happy.....|`|bfWcfCKXaa	All moral and decent people give gifts freely. That is why Allah is immoral. He does not give his gifts freely but threatens to roast you like a Kebab and torture in his torture chamber if you do not believe him and his prophet. That is neither love nor moral. But in Islam, Allah is not bound by reason or morality or his own law. The Islamic god acts with total caprice. Any rational person would recognize the profound immorality and total absurdity of Islamic theology and philosophy.|`|DxogcPYpaa	Without happiness you'll be lonely. You don't want that to happen do you?|`|c1Mq2ejmaa	yeah<br>  <br>  <br>  @pedram, what is HF<br>  u knoe what i mean cool wallhee

HenWgGkFaa	A great deal of white women seem to think that the average white man loves large breasts, so they go to the plastic surgeon for them. The absolute worst are the women whose implants make their breasts look hard as rocks or too far apart!|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Generalization much?!  I know dozens of white women and not one of them ever had an enlargement!  I know I never will.<br>  <br>  Are you just going by what celebrities do, because you know they're NOT a good example of the general population!<br>  <br>  But nice job jumping to the conclusion that white women are shallow.  That's nice.  /sarcasm|`|WAoNhHB1aa	I wouldn't get a boob job if my life depended on it, dollface.  That is just wrong on so many levels.  I believe that many white girls I know feel the same.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Why are black women so quick to get butt implants?<br>  <br>  Breast implants are fine. No one cares. They look good and they make people feel good so what's the problem? Millions of women stuff their bras and butt andwear girdles. Plastic surgery is just a hyped up version of makeup and stuffing. Guys would much rather take off a bra and find implants rather than tissues and rubber inserts.|`|5tY3eZcoaa	I hate seeing those huge unrealistic looking implants.  I think women are their own source of self confidence so I don't argue what they should do to their bodies, but I hate that many look forward to plastic surgery even if it can kill them.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	hey, if that's what they want to do than i'm fine with it, it's not like it's killing me or anything, if they want big hooters, then bring it on!|`|2xaVpnNNaa	because of media...and all the stuff it portrays......and then so many people are superficial.|`|wh3BAc4taa	Who are you to judge what women should get or not? You already have breasts. There are some women who doesn't have any breasts at all. Life is not easy for the flat-chested women. Most guys wouldn't notice flat-chested girls. Clothes don't fit well, and flat-chested girls don't wear swimsuits because there's nothing to hold the top. So don't preach on about women shouldn't get implants, it's a personal decision. Unless you've walked in a person's shoes, then don't judge.<br>  <br>  People that thinks that some girls that do it that are influenced by the media is wrong. I'm sure that most people wouldn't like it they had a body similar to a 12 year old boy.|`|6eVyP3xpaa	How would anyone know you are part white, and even if we did, why would it matter?

But you are correct, lots of white women have breast implants. When you are a white female a whole lot of emphasis is put on your physical appearance. I'm beautiful so I didn't need them. But some women who are say lacking in beauty like try to make up for it with breast. Black women are allowed to put on weight , it makes white men really mad.|`|i137wuuiaa	because they are superficial....not all of them but the ones who get it....they want to show off their **** cuz they have nothing better...some do it because they actually need it..but i dont think anyone needs it...everyone is beautiful naturally...unless something horrible happens and u get in a car accident..then you can get plastic surgery like for example a nose job...but not when u think it just looks bad...|`|6UZhC0ZRaa	my guess is that white women are more effected by how they look then other races of women. they want to be the hottest girl around, and having big breast makes them think that they are the hottest. me personally it doesnt matter how big a women breast are i like them for who they are|`|mfNAdjVBaa	they need something to boost their morale..lol<br>  <br>  <br>  @Rabu- I know alot of black women and NONE have butt implants, in case you havent noticed they usually come equipped in that department already|`|DFVCzzvyaa	Because us white guys are usually breast men and you white women know you can get more sugar daddies if you invest the 5 or 8 thousand dollars in boob augmentation|`|fjsczTsMaa	I don't know, because statistically white women have the largest breasts anyway!|`|qSWQx2Guaa	Why do other women care so much?

eoxx8KKPaa	As long as the usa is willing to target her 100 pieces of  long range missles to Ottawa, and as long as she send out a warning to canada that a nuclear bomb is going to drop in the far north of canada ( so the nuclear dust wont affect the usa ), I am sure, canada would just plead for surrender IMMEDIATELY without the usa waste a piece of missle.<br>  <br>  In that case, we can own all the natural resources that canada have and no need to rely on her.<br>  <br>  Canada's arm force is non-threatening AT ALL, no offence.|`|voxCmK1Haa	Well, after 10 minutes of fighting, the US would be in possession of Canada.<br>  <br>  There would probably get an outcry from the rest of the world though.|`|4INE794zaa	I can not speak about what our government may, or may not have in store for the possibility of that happening. But, as a regular citizen,  I think every Canadian has thought about it, what will happen when the US bleeds their country dry of all resources......I am sure by then, the US will have worn out its welcome with its few remaining allies, depleted all military funds on ridiculous wars of greed, and let arrogance make them blind to what countries not so favourable of the US may, or may not be doing with their own military as we speak........While they are off dumping millions into Iraq and Afghanistan, ignoring their own people's needs at home by diverting a sizable chunk of tax dollars into war mongering, do they ever stop to think what Russia, Japan, and other countries may be up to? And don't count us Canadians out so quickly. We may appear docile, friendly and amicable, but I am willing to bet all Canadians would stand up and fight, to preserve the way of life we love, our standard of living, the human rights we value and uphold. This is why there will never be a North American Union. Canada is nothing like the US, nor wants to be.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wow. Never thought there would come a day, when I might concur with something Tara J has said........<br>  <br>  <br>  *Ah doglover, don't look now, but your ignorance is showing. Do you think a bunch of missiles pointed at Ottawa would mean anything? Sure, its our Nations capital, but really, its just a bunch of offices. We have military bases all over the country, in small towns, large cities, remote places not even on maps. Go ahead, blast us with your nukes, you will all die as well. Ever hear of the Natural Gas pipeline? Not to mention all the nuclear power plants we have, that would cause mass destruction. All nicely located close to the US border. You would destroy the resources you covet. Your answer astounds me............<br>  <br>  The US pantagon? bah ha ha ha. Its extremely obvious you know nothing of Canada, and probably have never even met one. Keep believing your spoon fed, propaganda. Its what keeps you in line.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	it would be 1812 all over again.|`|L6u8Tgq7aa	Yes its true our Military is far smaller than USA. But it also serves a different function, It is far less offensive more of a peace keeping force.<br>  If the USA invades Canada, the outcry and retaliation from the rest of the world would be crippling for the US. We have more allies and more resources to persevere through the long run.|`|fscgp7iFaa	If the USA invaded Canada the rest of the world would see what @$$holes you are. Sure you might win but you're so stupid you wouldn't be able to find Canada with a map a compass and a guide to show you the way.|`|WX1b747Iaa	I could only see it happening if the USA wanted to take over a solvent, functioning banking system.|`|d3VV4b6vaa	The US is going to invade Mexico, not Canada. And our 'immigrant race' wouldn't put up with the US army anyway.|`|IK8VW4FZaa	We would be at their mercy.  America could easily invade and take over Canada, just as they did in Iraq.  But, just like Iraq, we would resort to IED's, suicide bombings and any other kind of guerrilla war-fare to make occupation impossible.  You think it's bad in Iraq and Afghanistan, you ain't seen nothing yet.  Not to mention the entire world would rise up against the US in protest of the invasion of a peaceful nation.  Your trade would dry up, you'd be kicked out of NATO and the UN, economic embargoes and you would probably face a military response from the world community.  <br>  <br>  It would be almost the dumbest thing America could ever do.  It would never happen.|`|pw0wnGIHaa	so many ignorant americans who don't think Canadians have an equally capable army.<br>  <br>  For youe infoirmation, you might look at the two wars that America has not finished.<br>  <br>  You might want to thank our allies in Afghanistan who should have no reason to stay considering bush's irresponsible war in Iraq which has made things worse in afghanistan. but they are still there helping us.<br>  <br>  Yes Canadians can and will kick our asses and send us back. If afghanistan and iraq has thaught us anything military might is not everything.<br>  <br>  Oh dog lover, instead of being so stupid why don't you find out information about the Canada's army.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Probably America would win. America has more people in its army than Canada has in its whole country. Canada would be outnumbered.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Then Canada has every right to defend itself, and to have other nations jump in to aid its defense. I hope that scenario will never happen. Just my view.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	LMAO  americans would first have to find out where Canada is to point your missiles<br>  <br>  so ignorant|`|AnHQbZQAaa	The only time the US and Canada went to war, the US lost.

I have a very small English/Irish nose (with a nice upturn at the tip). We certainly have no problem kissing in any direction. Our noses just find ways not to mash uncomfortably. I suppose this is a sign that we're just that much more compatible.
Sn0CViR7aa	No, I'm afraid atheism is too bad to be true.  For atheism says that our very existence is a cosmic accident, without purpose or design.  According to atheism, life is absurd, and the only meanings we find are foolishly imposed by ourselves.<br>  <br>  I don't have enough faith to be an atheist because I can see God's intelligent design everywhere I look. For example, the whale (trumpeted as evidence of Darwinistic accident) proclaims a marvelous designer in its ability to dive miles deep into the ocean (my ears hurt at 2 meters), to resuscitate calves born underwater within minutes of birth, to nurse babies at nipples with watertight seals to prevent mixing milk with seawater, and to use echo location, a natural sonar, to navigate the ocean depths. <br>  <br>  In short, the whale exhibits wonderful design for its ocean habitat.  The idea that such complex processes as deep-sea diving, watertight suckling, and echo location could have evolved by the gradual accidents proposed by Darwin is not plausible.  If the whale cow had to gradually evolve a process to start her calves breathing air, the whale species would have long since extinguished.<br>  <br>  Jesus explained how good seed that falls on rocky soil will spring up quickly but die just as quickly in the hot sun. Similarly, moderns will abandon God's message that we are made in his image over the tenuous and tendentious speculations of the atheists.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|bEeozqacaa	Atheism is too good and its true.<br>  Atheism not a religion!<br>  <br>  We do not believe in mythological creatures. It is harder to be an atheist because most people are so close with the imaginary friends (Jesus & God). We gave up our imaginary friends. Atheists have a harder life considering we live in a Christian society.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	Do you really think it is easier?  Really?

If you believe in a God, then that opens up the possibility that the God may have laws in place that he expects you to follow, and will therefore hold you accountable.<br>  <br>  A belief in no God avoids all that, and therefore you can live your life however you want, "so long as no one is getting hurt".<br>  <br>  Of course, your belief is irrelevant.

It takes a LOT of study (of the bible, the koran, and other "holy" literature), and it a source of constant harrassment from believers.

U8Fwh38jaa	I would think so.  I've often wondered about that aspect and why an olive branch would even have been available for the dove to bring back.  I think it would've taken years if not decades for the trees and plants to return to normal after such an event, if they even survived at all.  I guess we're supposed to believe that Noah's family and the multitude of animals were able to survive on a boat with limited rations until the plants and trees and other flora grew back.  Kind of farfetched I think.|`|tSYWajIPaa	idk let me get back to u on that i will ask my pastor|`|EBGdlo35aa	Indeed it did - Noah knew that the waters had receded and life returned to the land when a dove returned bearing an olive sprig in its mouth.

On paper, I write white because how percentages come up, I think I'm mostly white at like 40% white and 60% whatever is left over. But if someone asked me, I'd say everything. that I am. I think it's disrespectful to say a part of your family doesn't exist. All the biracial people I know call themselves black. Even though a lot don't even look black.<br>  <br>  Blue is right in a sense.Most people identify with the race they're more of (3/4 black indentify with black and 3/4 white identify with white).|`|PLtU5AuYaa	Piano is what I mark.<br>  <br>  Boo Yah!|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Lol, even though I get what the question is asking it kind of doesnt make sense.  A race and an ethnicity are different.  My race and ethnicity arent the same. My race is BLACK duh...okay so technically I would be mostly black therefore I am black. Ethnicity would be like a sum of everything I am which would include all heritages combined. <br>  <br>  Dont we consider Maliah and Sasha to be black? Technically they are only 3/4 black.  Dont we consider Halle Berry to be black? What about Mariah Carey? Leona Lewis? dare I say Nicole Ritchie? What will we call them.  Now to me all of them are black well maybe not Nicole.

NvGqiA4vaa	yep, that's right. reflexive verbs mean you're someone is doing whatever the verb is to themselves.<br>  <br>  also, i thought "s'en aller" means "to go away". it's probably a second meaning. you can use it if you want someone to go away (used in anger): "va t'en!!!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ****lily, "i'm going" is just "je vais", and "i'm leaving" is "je pars"|`|nK4j9s7paa	Je m'en vais. means "i'm going" or i'm leaving<br>  run means courrir<br>  <br>  Je me coiffe = I am doing my hair - that's correct|`|mdV0oXATaa	Oui, ce correcte|`|81bda06b67f3aa041e733ff5f2351395aa	l agree with lilly,<br>  Je m'en vais means : l leave/l'm leaving (not run along).<br>  However you could say : je m'en vais en courant.<br>  Je me coiffe : l'm doing my hair.

Mind you, I'm not saying he'd be entitled to beat her.  But if striking someone is necessary to stop her violence, that's more than cool in my book.<br>  <br>  I had a college roommate who was the stereotypical size-3 blonde and dated a guy on the football team.  When she got drunk and surly one night, she absolutely pummeled her boyfriend and he didn't even raise a hand to stop her, since he knew that if he so much as grabbed her arms to stop the attack, he'd be the one accused of being violent.  Sadly, I think he was right.  The poor guy had bruises and blood on his face from being cut by her rings, but if he'd left so much as a thumb impression on her arm, he would have been accused of overreacting because he was such a big guy.  It's a sick double standard.  A woman should have no more right to hit a man than he has to hit her.|`|mlmSRkhGaa	I would hit a woman for the same reasons I might hit a man.<br>  I would not hit any person for an insulting remark or an act of agression.

However if she's attacking you, or hitting your child, then yes, I would defend myself and my child.<br>  <br>  In school girls will sometimes hit boys because they know the boys won't hit them back.  Sometimes girls use this to their advantage.  In these cases, where a girl is bullying a boy because she knows he can't hit her back because boys don't hit girls, I think the girl gave up her right not to get hit and the boy should defend himself against the girl.|`|AA11033942	In general there is never any good reason for any violence, and society at large determines that hitting a woman is frowned upon more than hitting a man, but there are plenty of double standards in operation and if some one is armed with a weapon and threatening you (male or female) then you are within your rights to use a little force to defend yourself.<br>  <br>  The way you ask the supplemental question, it suggests an answer of "welcome her with open arms, but make sure YOU open the bottle (i.e. keep the opener only for its intended use) and share it with her" but I get the idea that's not what you actually meant.<br>  <br>  Just by way of a reference point, Chris Brown had absolutely no reason to hit Rhianna like that...|`|d748d8e10f1d98d96305ada8117301ebaa	There is no reason for a person to hit another person.

The girl drinks more than her capacity, and she's in denial about it. Don't go out with her any more. When she asks why, tell her that you can't deal with the amount she drinks. She might dump you over it, so be it. She is not going to quit drinking too much until she admits that she drinks too much, and you can put her on the path to that realization even if you lose the friendship. That might happen, and you'll deal with it by accepting that the friendship is lost anyway. She has a drinking problem, and you need to get out from under it.

uTxjdidgaa	YES.. i always have, Logic should be first prioritized than math, science, english, religion, sociology, politics, history etc..<br>  <br>  It's one thing to teach people mathematics, but we first need to be taught about Reasoning - Its as if People don't care if they don't know how to think accordingly...<br>  <br>  logic should be introduced to children as soon as possible, the same time we teach them how to count 1 2 3... <br>  (i mean not that everyone should be a philosophy major, but logic is something as simple as 1 2 3, and can become as complicated as well as calculus)|`|xo4iux9gaa	because public schools have out lawed it ....along with God.|`|AA11562077	Yes, I do -- but "logic" is very difficult to teach directly before college age.  So much depends on the quality of teachers -- and their students' willingness and background.<br>  <br>  As we've discussed before, I would like to see Ethics taught at an early level -- say beginning in Junior High.  To be taught what is right and wrong -- this would do a lot of good.  I mean, how about acting-out situations where kids can take the role of an anti-social person, so that when they inevitably encounter this kind of behavior it won't seem to come out of a clear blue sky the way it does now.<br>  <br>  Let's have role-playing about gossip, about lying, and about cheating and how it's done. Kids so often set forth as I did, starry eyed on their way to the promised Oz that gleams on the horizon, only to find themselves waylaid by the Wicked Witches and flying monkeys of this world, and utterly unprepared.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	I did, until I realized that for a teacher to teach a subject they have to be able to understand it themselves.<br>  <br>  I'm sure many could do it....but where I went to college they had to have a special  dumbed down, "Math for Education Majors" class because so many of the Education Majors were flunking out of Math 101 and were thusly unable to graduate.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Yes, I do wonder.  I guess they are hoping that children develope it on their own.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	It should at least be taught in high school.  Seriously.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Yes.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	I do teach some basic logical fallacies to my 7th and 8th graders.  However, with the No Child Left Behind mandates, there are so many other things that have to be taught that I can't focus as much as I would like to on that.  I would like to see more of it in high school when I think their brains are more ready to differentiate between good and bad arguments/evidence.  I guess I should add that the basic logical fallacies are part of my state's curriculum.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I actually was when I first got to college, my first bio professor was teaching a freshmen lecture that was really meant for non science majors (it was all that fit in my schedule), and we spent a weekish on logical fallacies. I liked that class a lot and thought eveyone should take that part of it and it would work in a high school class too. <br>  <br>  There is so much to cover in high school sometimes they just forget to go over the basics again.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	This really embarks on a much larger issue about our educational system.  <br>  <br>  As someone else mentioned: No child left behind, only allows teachers to go by certain curriculum standards and if the children don't understand: Tough! <br>  <br>  I had a friend from Dartmouth who got his teaching certification and worked in an impoverished school, teaching mathematics. He stated that he wanted to help some children but contract stipulations would render him fired if he held up the class to teach these children.<br>  <br>  When it comes to higher education, we rank well, but our lower and middle school rankings? We are 25th on the list (third world countries outrank the US here).  <br>  <br>  This is a severe disadvantage to our children: Personally, I am terrified for my daughter and other children. <br>  <br>  If you're interested: There was an excellent show on the subject called: "Stupid in America" which I will link you to below.|`|NI0cNU22aa	Actually, we had Theory of Knowledge and Logic and Semantics as mandatory classes at my yeshiva.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Too busy not teaching basic math and grammar.<br>  <br>  I sympathize, but they're overloaded as it is.|`|5AaV7koHaa	They have enough problems with their native tongue and Math, last time I glanced out my parlor window, we were still on the planet Earth...Not Vulcan.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	How exactly are they supposed to go about this?|`|Qvc0tVOnaa	It is taught some people are just ignorant!|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	Spiritual is beside the point.   That's the point, perhaps.  I suspect most teachers wouldn't be capable of teaching logic anyway, especially in Faith-based schools.   And if children were taught to use logic it would terrify most adults even more than they are already.   And what a mess it would make of the economy, and politics!   So we can't afford it.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	I didn't learn how to think objectively and logically until I was working on my master's thesis, after 3 bachelor's degrees. I still have to set aside my emotions at times so I can be objective, but sometimes that's very hard to do when you are being called a (take your pick), moron, idiot, dumb, retard, on drugs, insane, deranged, delusional because you CAN think logically on a public forum, and tie other people up in their own illogical thinking and false assumptions, with photographic evidence or links to back up what you are talking about. <br>  <br>  I tried to approach politics logically and objectively in 2006, until I finally understood that there is extremely little about politics that is logical. <br>  <br>  For those in high school who enjoy or have to take debate, that is an attempt to get students to think logically. However, with all those teenage hormones roaring, trying to be objective and relatively non-emotional is very difficult, as in almost impossible to achieve consistently.|`|28fd86ae8f5710704b6a01cc48ab5d33aa	No doubt to make up the shortfall experienced at home. <br>  It used to be that basic reasoning was taught by one or both of your parents. Now, if it isn't taught in school, people complain. Soon they will need to have "How to Wipe your own Backside" classes, and complain to the school when it is not being done properly.<br>  .|`|23YPEAqBaa	That is one of those things that kids need to start learning early, at home. American education also needs an overhaul, with emphasis put on a moving forward, not just getting by. Or we need to stop letting into this country people who take up all the jobs that will provide a living to the underachievers that our U.S. school system spits out.|`|AA11006063	No, because it is not something that is taught in a conventional manner.  When you realize you have it, you are probably through your school age years.|`|8PjHFUdfaa	Logic has it's limits.

Likely, not, nor will you, much to your future's chagrin.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a blessed day.|`|AA11690436	Okay, for funny hat, day of the week, building design, & religious symbols you're on your own.  For something to pray to and silly stories, you may BORROW my explanation for intelligent design.  We have been built by the collective consciousness of various groups of bacteria.  That's right, individually, they are just microscopic bits o' self replicating molecules, but together, they become a potent force.  And they have been slowly creating more and more complex multicellular life forms to use as food, housing and transportation devices.  Groups of competing bacteria species have been fighting turf wars for billions of years.  That's right, we are the ultimate weapon in a bacterial arms race.  The "good" bacteria, that live in our digestive tracts and who we need in order to digest our food, have created us to try and wipe out many competing species of bacteria.  So we can pray to our own bacterial collective consciousness, or, if we, ourselves, are conscientious objectors to the war, we can pray to rival bacterial strains.|`|mSFjbetxaa	You should know that selling guilt and fear is extremely lucrative.<br>  <br>  So make the sheeple feel like they are born sinners who would go to "hell" if your religion didn't "save" them.

IgBNbTg1aa	I look at people for what they do, how they act & treat others. That's my way of seeing who they are rather than their colour or ethnicity. If they are kind, it's easy to be kind in return! As for discrimination... I was born with A.D.D. & called stupid an idiot a dummy. As a lesbian, I was outed in high school, beaten & called so many vicious names. I've dated an African American girl & been called ***** lover. I dated a Japanese girl & called a chin* lover. I dated a First Nations girl & told I stink from her. I ignored it as they wanted to upset me & just walked away. But when I see discrimination, racism, I speak out against it, counter it & I brought up my daughters the same way.|`|wvZoOS9uaa	it very simple really, as long as we have colors there's going to be racism. You tell the difference between people based on physical features of human being. Thats what's the difference between Joe and Bob and Tom and Bill. So when you think of that you choose what you don't like about a certain group of people and thats discrimination. When that one thing is skin definition, its racism.|`|WFX5jQeQaa	I personally have never been discriminated against because of my race, but a lot of whites are discriminated against because they are perceived as nerds and "crackers", but the same goes for blacks, mexicans, and many other races.|`|i1rufDxQaa	it,dependeson their cultures and humanity it needs to educate yourself and think  globaly  my language on english is not perfect sorry|`|kMoC5dJ1aa	Well I have been discriminated against because of my sexual orientation, and it is a hard wall to climb over. Eventually though you will see that you are not alone and that it is ok to be who you are. My opinion to how to see people and people is to realize that nobody is better than anybody. We are ALL equal. And if we all turn over our hands. Dont we all look alike? :)|`|g5RS83paaa	I haven't been, but I have to admit I was nervous when my son was placed with a black roommate at college because they're are very  few at our high school.

You are right, people should accept everyone as equal or else they're missing out on getting to know someone|`|AA12133859	Of course, the issue is not racism so much rather recognizing and DECIDING not to act on it.

Before we had money the would get the people around & get them to give up there animals as a sacrifice. It is the same way today. Many churchs get people to bring in others like they are sales people except in their mind they are doing God's work or proving something to their ego by having more people go along with what on some level they know is ridiulous.|`|uFAoq4idaa	God is not religion. God is a companion. We need God as a Father. He is concern of our good and future life. He sent Jesus to be our friend and comforter. He was offered as a sacrifice for our sins. God wants us to have fellowship with His son so that we will know and understand Him as a Father and God who loves us. Religion is nothing without a relationship with God. Accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior is not a religion. It is the reality of Life. With must have Him in order for us to go to the Father God. This is reality and nothing can hinder God for planning all these things for us. Blessed are those who believed for theirs is happiness and joy with God. God is real and Jesus His Son had come into the world. And to comfort the believers He sent His Holy Spirit to teach, protect and guide them to righteousness holiness and perfection. For His Son Jesus will come back to take those who really believed and obeyed His commandments. Jesus will present them to His Father. They will live with Him forever and ever.

Thousand and thousands have given their lives because they knew that God's Word is true.  You dishonor those people who were fed to the lions, tortured and imprisoned, simply for believing that God entered into time and space and loved you and I so much that He was willing to do it and die a horrible death for us.  Maybe the millions who do believe are not as bored as you may think, perhaps they have experienced God in their lives and I pray that you will also one day.|`|b0AvMRqbaa	It's simple. If the powers that be can make you all believe what they want you to believe, then you will believe anything they tell you. As long as they say they too believe. Now I don't trust anyone who uses the word God. Imagine what they can get people to do and believe. You have to ask yourself to who's benefit. Who will also benefit from division in peoples due to religious brainwashing. Who allows drugs to thrive on all sides of the world, no matter the religion. We are all becoming zombies. To who's benefit to make people believe in fairytales. They aren't even nice fairytales.|`|jo6pKDF9aa	Control of the masses.  Let them _think_ they are being watched, it means you don't have to waste the resources _actually_ watching them (which would be impossible, frankly) so long as you don't break the illusion and punish in the name of the illusion anyone who does see through it by burning them at the stake and so on.

This prevents pain for its adherents, usually by limiting their disappointments or in a few cases ensuring their successes in the material world. <br>  <br>  The Taoist identity, for example, is that people and all other things are only a part of a larger, cosmic force called Tao, an impersonal force that defies description, from which all things are made. It has no mind, no purpose, it just is. So Taoists strive to be a lot like Tao, mindless and purposeless, and that gives them a lot of peace. They believe that this peace comes from harmony with Tao. It also very effectively curtails any thoughts they had of achieving an individual identity and the stresses associated with this quest. <br>  <br>  Hinduism eliminates the need for a personal quest for identity by assigning people a caste upon birth. This may have come from a concern to preserve an aristocracy in the beginning, and expanded in forms to keep its adherents busy while they muddled through this world. If a person is born into a low caste, nothing they do will ever advance their position in society. If they are particularly good, they may be reincarnated into a higher caste in their next life, or if they are particularly bad, a lower caste. This predetermination keeps people from seeking a greater identity in this world, holding out all their hopes against their next life. <br>  <br>  Buddhism is highly involved with Hinduism, but is quite different in many respects. Buddha's concept of Karma is that a person's actions cause them suffering or joy in the world. Rather than have people live the awful lives of basing their identities on material success, Buddha tried to make them concentrate on values that would see them through this world with a minimum of grief by taking “the middle path.” So this “middle-path” identity is what Buddhists seek. To be too good a person would result in their reincarnation as a god, and to be too evil would result in their reincarnation as a lower being or as a denizen of hell. It was considered best by Buddha to take the middle path and be reincarnated as a human being again. (In Buddha's beliefs, gods were reincarnated humans; the complication with being a god was gods in their relentless quest for pleasure forget their own need for salvation, die and are reincarnated as lower life forms.) This “middle path” mentality leads to a desire to neither excel nor fail, and so much stress is avoided by living a mediocre life. <br>  <br>  <br>  Judaism and Christianity<br>  A member of the Jewish faith believes that by birth, he is one of God's chosen people. That is his basic identity, although he is allowed complete self-determination in what he makes of himself in this world. <br>  <br>  A Christian believes that, when he comes to faith in Jesus Christ, he is adopted as one of God's sons. Just like a Jew, a Christian has complete self-determination in worldly things, except he is cautioned not to become a part of the world. As James 4:4 says, “Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.”|`|a8IslxsQaa	Religion was created so that a minority group could control a majority group. Let's see - the new testament is a nutshell:<br>  <br>  Life sucks, but things will be better when you die. Of course, that is only true if you follow our rules.<br>  <br>  Hmm...sounds like the sort of thing that slaves need to hear...|`|fhOlbSWaaa	=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=<br>  Dear friend,<br>  Please read my ANSWER CAREFULLY and follow the links, books & Videos, all free of charge, which provided below …<br>  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THE TRUTH OF THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD (Video)<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1276" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>  <br>  Wickedness, injustice,grief, pessimism,trouble, loneliness, fear, stress, frustration, distrust, unscrupulousness,anxiety, rage, jealousy, resentment, drug addiction,immorality, gambling, prostitution, hunger, poverty, social corruption, theft, war, struggle, violence, oppression, fear of death…News about these issues appear in the newspapers and on TV every day.The popular press devotes entire pages to these subjects, while others serialise articles about their psychological and social aspects. However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com|`|AA12226718	Religion was created to get people to follow rich men's rules.

In the case of the New Testament, the decisions were made by Christian councils as to what books to include.<br>  <br>  At some point, books such as the one you speak about were declared heretical by a council and most of Christianity goes along with those decisions, rejecting anything beyond the canon as represented by the protestant Bible (as opposed to the Catholic Bible with its additional apocryphal books).|`|b1f68fe4a7602cd05ee10c7b596c5a1baa	Banned is really not the correct term.

I used to be gothic/emo and looking back I see how retarded it is.]<br>  What pisses me off the most is that all these Goth kids think that they are the only ones allowed to like a good book like Twilight.

I'm thinking that it's just a phase that some teens go through. They could be in an "emo-ish" atmosphere, too. I don't have any problems with emos...some are even my friends. But, It's definitely a stage that some people go through in order to assert their "individuality" and "uniqueness" ^__^ There's nothing to worry about, unless she starts killing people and drinking their blood...eww. :]|`|FmazIF6Maa	It's the latest fad.<br>  <br>  They love the drama of it, romanticizing the idea, thinking of themselves as "special".

(im just sort of generalizing here)  some may seem insensitive, selfish, or obnoxious, but its pretty natural and i dont think theyre always aware of the things they do. they lack perspective, which is what most of us grow as we get older. but still, i think it always depends on how they were brought up cuz every child is brought up differently.<br>  <br>  and usually the ones that "hate" kids are either impatient people, or people who have high expectations or dont understand their ways. or maybe its because of that certain innocence children have that adults dont.|`|9RDSNzK8aa	Not really. Well it depends. I so dislike the ones with attitudes and think they're on top of the world. And if they resemble their rude and obnoxious parents, I'm even pissed!!

Its female counterpart is the succubus. An incubus may pursue sexual relations with a woman in order to father a child, as in the legend of Merlin,[1] and some sources indicate that it may be identified by its unnaturally cold penis.[2] Religious tradition holds that repeated intercourse with an incubus or succubus may result in the deterioration of health, or even death.[3]|`|5GiAYBmjaa	It is a male demon that seduces women and feeds off of sexual energy and lust.|`|ZoeS825Kaa	It has to do with a devil's offspring.<br>  I think it is a demon that impregnates women with the devils child

tYqUutidaa	You can tell time by a cat's eye.<br>  <br>  Throughout history, cats have been associated with all kinds of strange superstitions. For centuries, many sailors claimed to raise winds at sea by placing the ship's cat under a pot. Germans have long believed that cats can help see ghosts—just look between a cat's ears. In the United States, though, New Englanders have come up with a cat trick that really works—using the creature as a clock. As Wisconsin optometrist Les Thornburg explains, the construction of the cat's eye makes it an adequate timepiece.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	Just an old wives tale.

e7gkttgcaa	LOL...im 6'5<br>  <br>  ...*cough*..im maybe big**|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Penis size has nothing to do with height.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	No one really knows what determines the size of a penis.  I doubt the height of a man has anything to do with it though, because the penis does not grow like the body does.  With that said, you will find men of all heights with rather large/small penises.<br>  <br>  However, many researchers think it might have something to do with the physical fitness a man, but this theory is not proven though.  Why do researchers believe this?  The Penis works like a muscle.   Just like a muscle, if you exercise, more blood will go through that muscle.  When a Penis gets hard, it is because a certain amount of blood is going through it, which in turn causes heat to build; it is being used.   Just like a muscle, if it isn't used, it can shrivel up( get smaller)  Thus, the penis works like a muscle.<br>  <br>  Ezines has a variety of different Penis exercises that will extend the length of the penis, the fact there are penis exercises is another thing that suggests it works like a muscle.  It also important that a man receive a certain amount of hard on/s per day, whether they masturbate or have sex.  Why? Because just like a muscle, if you don't use it, it can shrivel up.  That's all I got to say about that.<br>  <br>  In conclusion: The Penis behaves like a muscle, and can increase or decrease size by the amount it is used or not used.  With that said, the amount of testosterone may have something to do with the Penis size, because testosterone determines how big a muscle will be, and how quickly the person can build it; that is my suggestion.<br>  <br>  I think it may be hormones, mixed in with a little physical fitness.|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	It really doesn't affect it, as far as I know.

It becomes strained sometimes for trying too hard! lol Then I read that Infinite patience brings immediate results!

You and I, and many others have come here to share our views on what we all seem to know; that a Big change is soon to take place.  We feel an urgency at the soul level to make preparations for this time. Not by hoarding water and food, but Spiritually preparing ourselves for what I believe will be the most momentous event since the beginning of time.<br>  Our mission, should we decide to accept it, is to try to enlighten everyone through thought, word and deed.

You can never put the food in your stomach to say that you will never get hungry the next day Just like goodness and righteousness for one day is not enough to keep you free for the next years to come.

I guess you at 15. Close?|`|S33poz4paa	First off, you think you're average?  Well I think you're above average but okay...<br>  <br>  Anyways, I think you look like your from Eastern Europe (or at least that's where your parents are from, you could be born anywhere but yeah).  Not so eastern that it's the Middle East or anything but I'm talking about areas like Ukraine and maybe Croatia just places like that.  You look like your a teenager, maybe 17 or 18.  I hope I'm close.|`|99bc62a1729f7af370f80d4bc3eef5c2aa	You look pretty good and athletic. I think your understating how you look. There are plenty of girls at my school that would come under you in terms of beauty. Besides I think your hot.|`|OfZHyuohaa	I think you're pretty.  You look like you could be in your late teens and I would guess that you're of Eastern European descent.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion|`|e9Mp8Zrraa	Probably 16 or 15?<br>  And American?<br>  <br>  Also i think you are average as well.|`|CX7FtsCMaa	id say your 15 , ? and your white ha :s lol i dno <br>  and id say your average , your a weird pretty in a good way lol <br>  <br>  <br>  hope it helps|`|MeGehliuaa	Hmm you look Russian or British.

Just as their are some whites who act like aholes but that doesn't mean I am going to post a question that says, "Why do all white people act like total aholes and expect to be treated with respect?"....<br>  What a dumb and racist question that would be.<br>  <br>  When you stereotype a whole race of people that is called racism.<br>  And That's what you just did.<br>  So yes, deny it all you want but your question is extremely racist AND false.|`|FZDUHFoyaa	im mixed with black and white and i feel the same way.  many black people act as if they deserve retrebution from what their ancestors went through, but they dont seem to realize that everything isnt just handed over on a sliver plater and that they dont deserve anything that they didnt earn.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Considering the horrible past blacks have had with equality, I'd say they have a right to be P.Oed if somebody's racist.

Maybe they have a very strong, brotherly bond. It's common to feel like that for a very close, good friend.<br>  <br>  But if he really thinks it's on a romantic level... hmmn. Romantic love normally does require at least a little physical attraction, but defining love is impossible for any human being really.<br>  <br>  So I'm not sure. Good question.|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	Life's Crazy. It can happen for some people. It's just weird.

I try not to embarrass Him, and I hope to be ready to tell someone about Jesus should they ask.<br>  <br>  There are some obnoxious Christians just like there are some obnoxious drunks, football fans, radio talk host etc.<br>  <br>  Not all Christians hassle people to be saved, but that doesn't mean we don't hope you will make good choices.|`|KrJqVyRVaa	because Jesus is coming very soon. read the bible and compare the things it says to what is actually going in today's world (revelation) , it all adds up...|`|ygbVWNTXaa	Out of love in thier understanding of an indoctrinated misinterpreted belief system.

You know be sublime about it... But then you've got my brethren who are insane and want to throw a bible on your head and just over do it.|`|09mW6AU2aa	because it bothers them that they pay deference to something they know doesn't really exist, so they have to try to control the rest of us.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Because they don't want to see them eternally separated from God in Hell, At least that's the reason I do it. God bless.|`|AA11336384	They believe they will be "saved" from Hell.|`|jNQ0BhODaa	because they think its bad that people can think for themselves|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	I don't.  Why do you generalize?|`|xo4iux9gaa	"But as many as received him (Jesus), TO THEM he gave the power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his name, which were born.... not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but were born of God"- (John 1:12)|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Because Jesus is coming soon.|`|jBYxEX8taa	If people do not wish to hear the Word of God, then all they need to do is to ask those offering to talk to them about it, to please go away. It's nothing to start ranting about. The same can be applied to salesmen knocking on doors trying to sell random products. It is annoying, but just tell them to please leave.<br>  <br>  The reason Christians try talk to people about God is to help them, not harm them. What does a Christian gain out of helping someone get saved except for a good feeling in their hearts? They do not recieve money or any type of materialistic gain for it. If you do not want to hear it, then stay away from them.|`|AA10057370	Why do atheists tell christians to "shut up'"?Why do they tell them to keep christianity to themselves?Why can't atheists understand they don't have "super rights" (allowing them to use courts to ban christian monuments and documents.Remove prayer and the bible from schools) they seem to think they have?Why do atheists report prayer,bible questions,and other christian postings (in R&S)?Why do atheists hassle christians with mockings,***,LOL,*drink*,shut up,idiot,stupid,etc?<br>  <br>  Why don't atheists understand christians have just as much right to believe in Jesus and express those beliefs?Atheists express their beliefs which include verbal attacks on christians.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Because we think it would be a bigger "hassle" to suffer for eternity separated from God.     We Christians are genuinely hopeful that all people will accept the eternal salvation of Jesus Christ.   It is very important,  and we care about all people.  I know that some of us act in ways that seem like we are sometimes thoughtless and rude.  We are humans,  and we sin.  For those occasions, I am sorry.<br>  <br>  Please understand that we write and talk about the importance of salvation because it is eternally important.  If we irritate you a small amount now,  but it leads you to a joyous eternity,  we figure it's all worthwhile.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  God The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit is real.<br>  He wants you to accept His mercy and love.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	It's a vehicle to harass people.<br>  <br>  Christ,Santa or whatever that part is crap. It's all about money,harassment,rape,etc.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	Because the thought of others spending eternity in hell is highly motivating.  If you are being "hassled" by another believer...they have it wrong in their technique...but their heart is in the right place, so please cut them some slack, and investigate the claims of Christ closely.|`|Z6TNsJluaa	If you are being hassled..Just plainly tell them, "Look I love to sin, I love the fact that Satan is my Father and that one day I will meet him in hell.

And I will explain why.<br>  <br>  I think, that a church has every right to deny marriage to a gay couple, after all their religion dictates that it is wrong and no one should have to force them to allow it. But in that same logic, I think that marriage should ONLY be available to people who are active in the church and are clearly religious. Not Christmas and Easter religious people.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the government? No one has any right to dictate who can/cannot be married. There should be an entire other type of union for non religious/gay/whatever people that is recognized by the government completely equally.<br>  <br>  That way, religious people can have what they want and if they ALSO want to be unionized beneath the government they can do that too, but it would be a completely seperate ordeal.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	Because Society was raised on the concept of marriage is only between man and woman based upon religious beliefs that are in the world today. <br>  They don't want to change this concept. I think the world has to really look within themselves to see that they may be wrong in their thinking and allow the union of any two people as legal!|`|KKCMIE04aa	I suspect that most people support the legal aspects of the issue, or don't care because it doesn't personally affect them. I am sure there have been high ranking members in Parliament. In the US we have a black President, 45 years ago in my home town we separate schools and theaters. Change begins with one and spreads. In my town that one person was the police chief who wanted to maintain peace.It will happen. Every cultural change starts with one person. In the US there is that annoying bible verse or marriage between man and woman.

Doesn't matter what he looks like. He's still biracial. And the one drop rule was founded by white racist. I'm sorry, but I don't define myself by what a racist says. That "rule" was found unconstitutional in 1967. Anyone citing that unscientific rule ought to be ashamed. Doesn't matter how he would have been treated years ago, things aren't segregated now.

After the first two years, I got really frustrated and wasnt doing so hot either. I talked to my spanish teacher about what he thought. ( he spoke spanish and french) his advice ( that i'll give to you) is that Spanish is definatly easier to learn. Especially if you have trouble with accents and pronounciation<br>  <br>  Spanish words can only have 1 accent mark, always facing to the right, and every letter is pronounced. In french, there are multiple different accent marks with different sounds, and they are written in every direction. Also, french is infamous for writing out ten letters and pronouncing three. <br>  <br>  Needless to say, i stuck with spanish. Also, if you just have a general hate for spanish, I would recomend taking German next year. Many words are close to English, and a lot of English words have German roots... Bueno Suerte

Sex, for us, is purely for pleasure, bonding, expressing our love and attraction for each other. Most couples I know are done having children, but still have sex. It is for far more than procreation, and is not limited to just married couples. I would never marry a man (or woman) I was not sexually compatible to, and the only way to determine if you are sexual compatible is to have sex.<br>  <br>  I also don't think you have to be in love to have sex, either, but that's just reality..

So for its time (2000 years ago) it made sense socially.  Nowadays, with safe sex, the idea of extending it's pleasure before marriage has become more acceptable, due to measures to prevent unwanted pregnancy or the transfer of STD's.  So long as one uses a condom (99% effective, btw) or if they're tested for STD's and use the pill/patch (99.99% effective), then there's virtually no harm. Me and my girlfriend have been sexually active for years.  And nothing negative whatsoever has come of it.|`|gw1N4IF7aa	Well, sex is meant for only married people.

Why would God make it pleasurable if it wasn't meant to be. But you are not supposed to use birth control(no, not even condoms) because you could be preventing a life. Though you do have the right to think on your own and make your own decisions. I say condoms are fine if you are not emotionally ready for a baby but anything else is just crossing the line.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!|`|UyDkYaXuaa	I'm Pagan and bisexual but I believe as long as there is no selfish emotion during sex it's okay.

Sex with love between married couples is not against God's law.  I still say it is okay for you and your fiance to have sex because you are in love.  Believe it or not, some people have never tasted true love and have never had a sexual relationship based on it.  These are the hypocrites who masturbate behind bathroom doors and preach from the pulpit that sex is a sin!|`|3a37c6d3eb9e914f155df7ad545276f4aa	If everyone had sex for procreation then we would all have huge family's. God does give us the ability to enjoy sex because it can make you much closer.  Sex with your fiance is fine for that.  Casual sex usually makes you feel bad.

izXIAxXGaa	The moon has effects on the tides of the ocean. It also has effects on women because they retain more water in their systems than men. The moon can heighten passions, either romantic or murder. <br>  So your friend is influenced by the moon. In what way? Does she have a strange desire to run naked in the woods and dance by the light of the moon?|`|yCTxg4t5aa	I think that it can influence certain moods, feelings, behaviour in people, there's no proof of it even though a couple of studies have been done.

The word "lunacy" in fact shares the same root with "lunar", which both come from the Latin word for moon—cognate with Spanish "luna", for example. <br>  <br>  But like I said, there's no scientific evidence supporting the folklore, and like so many things, it's just wishful thinking.|`|xETCO0rUaa	Scientists studied this! they did a test.

Sometimes I think some people think that prayer is a list that we bring to God and expect Him to answer just the way we would like.  Sometimes He does , but over the years I have come to the conclusion, through personal experience and study that prayer is more for the relationship that God desires us to have with Him, instead of stuff that we want to receive from Him.  Prayer is communing with our Heavenly Father, and aligning ourselves with His will for our lives, above anything else. Yes, we can petition God for answers and things, absolutely , however, the point of prayer is not to get everything that we want, but realize that God knows exactly what we need,|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Prayer is surrendering the ego part of an individual towards something higher. Trying to unite our individual mortal self with universal immortal self. During prayer, we try to keep our mind refreshed. We see all around us beauty and brightness. All happiness in and out.

Whenever one has a personal relationship with someone, they speak intimately to each other and in doing so the relationship becomes closer each time and over time, it becomes the normal thing to do and even is often anticipated with great expectation in extremely close relationships.  Prayer is the same thing when done in sincere conversation with God.  Too often we pray and are just handing God our laundry list of wants and needs and never spend time telling Him what is on our minds and in our hearts.  God wants a relationship with us not just to be our genie in the bottle type of God who gives us anything we want and when we want it.  That isn't love.  He wants us to love Him just like we would our spouse or girlfriend or boyfriend.  He wants us to anticipate our prayer time with him as an intimate loving time of relationship.  That is what prayer is.|`|oqnvY8Mxaa	Prayer is talking to God. <br>  <br>  Yep. That's it. Simple, yet amazing! People get the idea that is it "folding your hands, close your eyes, and kneel beside you bed". It is nothing like that. Any time (day or night), any where (school, home, in the car, at work), pray is simple stopping and talking to God. You can't reach God through e-mail, MySpace, or phone. Sometimes, a prayer is simply "God, please help me with this math test. Amen". Sometimes its a lot more, like "Dear God, please help my best friend because she has cancer and needs Your help to live till tomorrow".<br>  <br>  God wants to talk to you, and He wants to hear from you.

I do not believe that there is any case in the New Testament of Christians praying in public among non-believers *except* in those cases when people - of their own free will - gathered to hear the gospel.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, put it aside.  They're Christian, you're Christian, it's the kind of thing that Paul says we should respect in our fellow Christians even if we do not practice it ourselves.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|ypVQlOJvaa	I'm atheist and my family says grace in public places:<br>  <br>  "We love our bread, we love our butter<br>  Most of all we love each other."<br>  <br>  It's from the cartoon "Madeleine" and my kids would be disappointed if we don't say it.<br>  <br>  .|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	What you do now is just fine. The people you speak of are just making fools out of themselves by forcing their beliefs upon others. There is no reason why prayer needs to be shouted. Not only are they humiliating and disrespecting themselves and everyone whom they are praying with, but they are disrespecting God by "presenting Him" to the public in one of the most annoying possible ways.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	By speaking loudly they are calling attn to themselves & it sounds like they are doing it for show. Those who do things for the attn/praise of men have recieved their reward (when other ppl have noticed). <br>  <br>  Ppl can pray quietly or silently in public if they so choose. If it's a small group (like 2-3 couples), one of the other ppl can suggest before the meal that they would like to be the one who says grace. Then, a quieter version could be offered as an example for the couple. However, it's doubtful it will do any good. <br>  <br>  These ppl already know God can hear silent/quiet prayers, but they choose to be loud & attract attention. Perhaps they are 'making up' for misgivings in their private lives. No one knows what goes on behind closed doors. I once knew a family who would pray over every meal & the meal wouldn't commense until everyone had assembled & it was prayed over w/everyone holding hands. They felt if they didn't do this that they were somehow doing something 'terrible.' Meanwhile, in their daily lives individuals did illegal drugs, a son in a gang, there was physical abuse, etc....but they *always* prayed over their food! (Not suggesting ur friends have anything like that going on, but just that ppl are a bit 'superstitious' about some things.)|`|IMKApyRDaa	To be honest, there is no good way. I really wouldn't say anything. I knew a few people who didn't have a problem letting everyone know about their faith in Christ. They were outgoing but I was reserved. I don't know their motives about what they were doing but I always felt that I was ashamed of Christ and my faith to a certain point and they were not. I know some people can be outgoing to the point of being obnoxious but since you don't know their heart you really can't say anything. You have to suck it up when you are around them. When I think of this I wonder if I would have been ashamed of being around John the Baptist or even Jesus at times in their ministries. I guess the ultimate would be that you can be soft spoken most of the time and have that unapologetic audacity if needed. I think Jesus was like this.|`|gw1N4IF7aa	Wow! I am going to be completly honest here, that is kinda embarresing!! So I can't remember the exact verse, it is in the beginning of Matthew on fasting. Jesus says that when fasting, they shouldn't go out and pray on the streets. Instead they should go in their inner room and speak only to God and tell no one of it. Your friends are doing the exact opposite. Maybe you should casually point it out like, maybe we should just say grace to ourselves in our heads. If they get mad break out the bible and don't say I told you so. It is something that a lot of people do, and it is ok to be proud of your faith. Just not like that. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!|`|AA10096992	My whole family and many friends are catholic. Many of them say grace before every meal. Not ONE of them says it loudly or makes a big show of it. <br>  <br>  There is NOTHING you can do.

Don't make yourself the target of their sanctimony.|`|cFaCmYrXaa	Oh great now I just had a *shudder*.... my parents go out of their way to make a complete spectacle of themselves while praying before dinner in a restaurant.

Correct? <br>  I am Jewish and for me and my family, faith is practiced at home or in a place of worship, for me in a Temple.<br>  I have gone out to dinner with Evangelical Protestants. They cannot confine their religion to themselves and must convert every one- and seize the opportunity of a meal in a public restaurant to preach. <br>  For you, when the Mass is ended, you genuflect and go home. For them, the preaching goes on every where.<br>  Your politeness may be your weakness with these people. And if you are not careful you will soon find yourself in a Revival Meeting- bring your asbestos suit for the Fire and Brimstone because don't you know that Catholics are not true Christians according to Evangelicals. <br>  Okay, to answer your question, you just have to repeat what you have said in your question to them. But get ready because this will hurt their feelings and it will be the start of them telling you what is wrong with you and why Catholics are not true Christians.<br>  I may be wrong. <br>  Try telling your friends what you stated here and see how they respond.

SERIOUSLY. he began to cry because he's never seen a black lady before. his parents were concerned for him, so they went to the principle and told them that his son is too scared of this black lady and cant learn if he's scared. so they switched him and gave him a white teacher. NO LIE<br>  <br>  what else can the principle do. my friend was 5-6 yrs old at the time, and a new immigrant who's never seen black people. he was very scared. so they gave him a teacher in kindergarden that he was comfortable with, and the new teacher was a  white lady|`|92iuiuZKaa	lol. this is ridiculous! you just want to come up with somethin to put blacks down!|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Wow.

Masturbation feels good, and isn't necessarily evil, however what comes along with Masturbation, porn, where you mind goes, etc, is.

Do they think that it is wrong? <br>  You can also talk to a priest or minister and ask him (or her if it is a Protestant minister), what is the Church's view on this. <br>  In the Catholic church, masturbation is a sin. This is because your sexual organ is to be used for the purpose of procreation, not recreation. Some priests believe that when a boy or a man masturbates he is committing an abortion because that seed that was meant to fertilize a woman's eggs was wasted for the guy's pleasure and discarded without being used to conceive a human life.<br>  The Catholic church is also against birth control and believes that married couples should have as many children as possible. A baby every year. Yikes. There was a time when most Catholic families had 12 children. A dozen kids!<br>  If you want my opinion, there is nothing wrong with masturbation so long as it doesn't interfere with your desire to go forward and find a mate. We used to have a saying in high school that masturbation makes you feel good but it doesn't get you any where. <br>  Now that you know how to please yourself, it is time to move on to stage two. Get a girlfriend and show her how you like it. Then she can show you how you she likes it. Just don't get her pregnant as you are only 15. Hand jobs are okay but if you two start to get into intercourse you had better have birth control pills, contraceptives, and condoms.

The only reason you changed your mind about it being wrong is because your religion says it is wrong.  That just shows that it is a natural occurance in all of us.  We all do it.  It is normal.,  There is nothing wrong with masturbation.  Most people masturbate until the day they die.  Don't let someone else tell you that it is wrong after you already had no problem with it.  It is a natural way to relieve stress and anxiety.  Everybody masturbates, even christians who say they don't.  They will just never admit to it.  Have you ever made yourself feel guilty?  Or has what others said to you made you feel guilty?  Forget religion, it restricts your mind and makes you feel like you have no control over yourself.  Remember these words when you are older.  Good luck on freeing your mind! <br>  You say that you only feel guilty after someone told you it was wrong.  This is someone else trying to control your thoughts.

By phrasing the question this way, you seem to be fishing for the answer you want to hear, rather than searching for the truth.  BE CAREFUL about that!  The world is filled with people who'll gladly tell you anything that you want to hear.  Go back and read Genesis.  The serpent was feeding Eve then Adam line after line that they wanted to hear!  Beware!<br>  <br>  Now ... I'm a CONSERVATIVE Christian who will tell you that there is only ONE Biblical passage on masturbation and it's the one dealing with Onan: <br>  <br>  In Genesis 38:7-10 we learn that Judah had a son named Er and a son named Onan. Er was married to Tamar. Because Er was evil, God killed him. Judah then commanded Onan to impregnate Tamar in order to raise up an heir for Er. Onan slept with Tamar, but every time he had sex with her, he spilled his seed on the ground. For this sin, God killed him. <br>  <br>  Many have interpreted this to mean that spilling one's seed in a manner not designed to result in pregnancy is a sin. This is the same argument used against contraception. However, the Bible does not teach that Onan's sin was spilling his seed in and of itself. It was simply the means by which he prevented Tamar's insemination. <br>  <br>  I would argue that IF we're simply talking about masturbation then the Bible does NOT prohibit this!  Saying that it does is another false teaching of the Catholic church!  <br>  <br>  Here is a full discussion of their error and the truth of Onan (note: the passage just above comes from this link):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reformedanswers.org/answer.asp/category/pt/file/99769.qna/site/iiim" rel="nofollow">http://www.reformedanswers.org/answer.as...</a><br>  <br>  With that said, there is more to masturbation than the simple act of stimulating oneself sexually.  The Bible doesn't prohibit that specifically, but it does prohibit a lot of behavior that goes hand in hand with masturbation.  So, at the very least, BE CAREFUL with masturbation!  It can lead to sexual deviance that is displeasing to God.  For a full discussion on the subject, here's a link geared toward teens:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://christianteens.about.com/od/whatthebiblesaysabout/f/masturbation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://christianteens.about.com/od/whatt...</a><br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|QppGjrfhaa	Oh god...you believe in that whole "masturbation's a sin" crap don't you? Well you shouldn't, did you know sexual repression can lead to depression among other health problems? It isn't a sin and anyone who tells you so is either lying or a hypocrite or both,so you should NOT listen to someone that tells you sexual feelings are a sin.

b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Ares is the Greek God of War. He is one on the Olympian gods, and he is the son of Zeus and Hera. He is also the lover of Aphrodite. Other than Aphrodite, he's not well liked by the other gods. Thats just a little introduction for him, the link below will give you tons of useful information. Enjoy!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Ares.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Ares.html</a>|`|uji29VvRaa	Ares, the Greek god of War, was the son of Zeus and Hera. The half-sister of Ares was Athena, the goddess of Wisdom and Skill. Athena also was a goddess of War but approached war solely for the purposes of justice.<br>  <br>  Ares had his residence up on Mount Olympus and his throne was upholstered with human skin. Usually he was accompanied by Eris, the goddess of discord. Ares' secret mistress was Aphrodite, the goddess of Love and Beauty; their union resulted to the birth of Armonia (Harmony), which was seen as a blend of two opposing powers.<br>  <br>  Just like his mother Hera, Ares had a very difficult character to deal with and was therefore rather unpopular among the other deities and mankind. For this reason, no Greek city wanted to have him as its patron. He often had conflicts and fights with Artemis, the goddess of the Hunt and also with his sister Athena, especially during the Trojan War.<br>  <br>  Ares was the first Greek god to be tried in the hill of Areios Pagus. Ares was accused by the Greek god Poseidon for having murdered his son Alirrothios, because Allirrothios attempted to rape Ares' daughter, Alkippe.<br>  <br>  Ares had a quadriga – a chariot drawn by four gold-bridled (Iliad v.352) fire-emitting immortal stallions. Among the gods, Ares was recognized by his bronze armor; he brandished a spear in battle. His keen and sacred birds were the woodpecker, the eagle owl and, especially in the south, the vulture. According to Argonautica (ii.382ff and 1031ff; Hyginus, Fabulae 30) the birds of Ares (Ornithes Areioi) were a flock of feather-dart-dropping birds that guarded the Amazons' shrine of the god on a coastal island in the Black Sea. In Sparta, the chthonic night-time sacrifice of a dog to Enyalios became assimilated to the cult of Ares. Sacrifice might be made to Ares on the eve of battle to enlist his support.<br>  <br>  In the Iliad (v.890ff) Ares rode into battle and when he was wounded he went back to Olympus where Zeus healed him, but with angry words. Then Ares went straight back to battle with shield in hand and a wand made out of the wings of pixies.<br>  <br>  Though involved in the founding myth of Thebes, he appeared in few myths.|`|6apINGylaa	Ares is the god of war. The name Ares derives from the Greek word αρ? (are), the Ionic form of the Doric αρ? (ara), "bane, ruin, curse, imprecation". Ara in Greek mythology was the goddess of destruction and revenge.There may also be a connection with the Roman war god Mars, via hypothetical Proto-Indo-European *M?rēs; compare Ancient Greek μ?ρναμαι (marnamai), "to fight, to battle".5]<br>  <br>  He is an important Olympian god in the epic tradition represented by the Iliad. The reading of his character remains ambiguous, in a late 6th-century funerary inscription from Attica: "Stay and mourn at the tomb of dead Kroisos/ Whom raging Ares destroyed one day, fighting in the foremost ranks".<br>  <br>  The Romans identified him as Mars, the god of war and agriculture, whom they had inherited from the Etruscans; but, among them, Mars stood in much higher esteem. <br>  <br>  Among the Hellenes, Ares was always distrusted. Although Ares' half-sister Athena was also considered a war deity, her stance was that of strategic warfare, whereas Ares's tended to be one of unpredictable violence. His birthplace and true home was placed far off, among the barbarous and warlike Thracians, to whom he withdrew after his affair with Aphrodite was revealed.<br>  "Ares"- god of war remained an adjective and epithet in Classical times, which could be applied to the war-like aspects of other gods: Zeus Areios, Athena Areia, even Aphrodite AreiaBurkert (1985). Greek Religion. pp. 169. <br>  <br>  In Mycenaean times, inscriptions attest to Enyalios, a name that survived into Classical times as an epithet of Ares. Vultures and dogs, both of which prey upon carrion in the battlefield, are sacred to him.

eGvyFeW9aa	If you're absolutely positive that you're bisexual, then go ahead and tell them. I'm not sure if there's really more than one way: when you're having an ordinary conversation, just bring up homosexuality. Once you know their feelings, then decide on if it would be good to tell them or not.. (: It's hard to tell, but if you have open minded parents, it should tend to turn out pretty great.<br>  Here's how I did it:<br>  My dad and I were talking, and he asked me why I seemed so unhappy. I told him about my best friend, who's bi, and how she recently told me she likes me. He said that she doesn't know what she's feeling, and that her hormones are controlling her every move. He then told me I shouldn't be guessing that I'm bi too (at the time, I considered myself to be bisexual). I told him that when you know, you know. I also told him that he will eventually have to accept me, or else sooner or later I won't be able to accept him as my father. :/ I'm still mad at him for that, and we're still having a hard time communicating. My sexuality actually makes him cry.. bleh. I just have no idea.<br>  I just hope I helped you! Good luck, and I hope things turn out okay. :D|`|qB3hMFPVaa	well do you know their views?<br>  <br>  don't come out if you KNOW if they will treat you different, and that they will not accept you<br>  <br>  I told my mom when i was 14, we were in a argument about something stupid that we got really heated about , i wannted it to stop so i blurted it out<br>  <br>  she shut up and walked out of the room shocked, it made me laugh...my dad was on the couch acting like he wasn't even there, like whoa<br>  <br>  :]<br>  <br>  she came back 10 minutes later, and asked me questions<br>  <br>  she gets kinda interrogating when i go out with friends now<br>  <br>  she's accepting, I kinda knew that she wouldn't mind<br>  <br>  "Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."<br>  <br>  so if you get that VIBE or any kind of indication that they won't like the fact that you are bi then wait till your older and on your own two feet<br>  <br>  just need to have a understanding of your family since they have always been around|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	Wait a few years before coming out.

The attractions have everything to do with elevated hormone levels and nothing to do with what will ultimately become your sexual orientation.  That's why there are so many teenagers who think they're bisexual, but who realize later that they're completely straight.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, but the vast majority who do this are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions during adolescence are normal, but also temporary.  When hormones drop to normal levels during late adolescence or early adulthood, the same-sex attractions disappear as quickly as they started.  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually all of the girls who identified as bisexual during school grew up to be happily heterosexual.  And the hipness of "playing lesbian" during adolescence actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in style.  Very often, they're used and tossed aside by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries without the risk of being labeled gay.<br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a very wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle with teenage hormones.  And she's the first to admit she never would have labeled herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  If you've always liked guys and the attraction to girls started at age 11, you're probably straight and just going through something that has caused girls to question their sexuality since the beginning of time.  Very often, sexual orientation doesn't make itself completely clear until late adolescence or early adulthood, since that's when hormones drop to normal levels.  That's why most girls who conclude they're bisexual find out they're actually straight in a few years.  They've "chosen" a sexual orientation, rather than waiting to find out what theirs truly is.<br>  <br>  At 14, it's normal to question your sexual orientation.  But if you jump to a conclusion based on hormonal impulses, you're just speculating about something you won't know for a few years.  It's not worth alienating your parents over something that's probably nothing more than temporary hormonal turmoil.  Just be patient and let nature do the work for you.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you're meant to be.|`|BU6pYizfaa	I would say keep it to yourself if they are against it.<br>  And... sleepovers can always be better when they don't know, if you know what i mean.

Y7ZSaTOtaa	Hispanic people can be any race as someone else pointed out.  The majority of Hispanic people are some sort of mixture anyway. African, European, Native American and to a lesser extent Asian.  The same can be said for African Americans. Its generally not known but most black Americans have European or Native American descent its just not to the extent that most Hispanic/Latino ppl have.<br>  <br>  Ever heard of Celia Cruz? The latin singer from Cuba.  She has dark skin and identified with being black as well as Latina. Trust me, I get my hair done at a Dominican beauty salon.  There are a few of the morenas darker than myself actually and are straight up Hispanic.  You can be basically any race and be Hispanic. Lol, essentially they are a group of mixtures that vary.  Really I would say if you have long wavy hair, you can be a shoe-in. Lol, I have half spanish cousins and light skin cousins.  My black cousins are mistaken for Hispanic often because of their hair or skin tone.  <br>  <br>  I would say there is no need to have a lighter skin tone really, love yourself how you are. Nothing wrong with being black lol.  But seriously some decent hair extensions should do the trick if you are light brown skin (not sure what that is) but yeah...that could help I guess. You can find bleaching creams or soaps at a local beauty supply though if its that pressing for you...nothing wrong with being black though embrace your culture.|`|92iuiuZKaa	It's possible. I've seen it plenty of times|`|DfDss68haa	There is no such thing as Hispanic race. Hispanic are Native American, Black, White, and Asian or combinations of all of the above. Don't believe the media that wants us the believe that Latino/Hispanic are olive to tan skin with brown hair. Some do look like that but this ignores all the Afro Latinos and Latinos with blonde hair and blue eyes. <br>  <br>  You sound like you have some self hatred issues going on. Embrace the African ancestory you have.|`|lJHPiAa5aa	omg im so tired of explaining this...hispanics are usually mexicans and latinos are from south america they are very very different only thing they have in common is that ppl in europe colonized both of them|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Hispanic people can be of any race. There are black, white and mestizo Hispanics. Just my view.|`|fusc1cykaa	Bleach your skin poser|`|5HPkIxZHaa	well many hispanics look black. all you have to do is curl your hair with gell. instead of having dry nappy hair, do what hispanics do, just put water or gell on it. i have a dominican friend and he said his mom looks black, but his dad looks white. he looks like neither. he looks light skinned with curly/nappy hair.<br>  too me domincan people are hispanics that have a strong mixed african look. they have slightly  lighter skin, and a straighter nose. but their hair is curly or nappy like africans.|`|wF2G3Krcaa	Easy, go to a black beauty supply store and buy the skin lightening creams, it will even out your tone as well as lighten it...

AA11033942	This might sound like an incredibly daft question, but why haven't you thought of asking your boyfriend's mother this question directly? (put a post script in your next correspondence) or even your boyfriend his opinion on this subject? Just because she signed her email the way you say she did doesn't necessarily mean that she'd do it the same way if it were a paper letter.<br>  <br>  I always have trouble remembering the rule of using "Yours Sincerely" or "Yours Faithfully" in letters, formal or otherwise, so generally tend to play it safe by signing off with "Regards"<br>  <br>  Using Mrs (last name) is incredibly formal, and while definitely polite, not always necessary. Think of it like "When in Rome, do as the Romans do" as the general rule, and whatever the local protocol which can vary widely by country, area, family and cultural reasons, but until told otherwise, that should be the one you follow.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Keep addressing her as Mrs. <boyfriend's last name> until she verbally tells you it is OK to call her by her first name.  It is probably OK to call her by her first name, but you want to wait and see.|`|AA12204752	When someone asks me to refer to them by their first name and I don't know them well. I usually call them by Ms.First Name or Mrs. First Name. That way I am not being disrespectful and still on a first name basis.|`|AA11156510	If she signed her note to you using only her first name, that is how I would address her going forward.  That may even have been her way of telling you to address her by her first name.<br>  <br>  As an aside: I'm in a relationship now that started 14 years ago.  For years I used Mr. and Mrs. to address the parents, until it just got ridiculous.  The other spouses all used first names, or Mom and Dad, and here I was, a grown man, using Mr. and Mrs.  It was awkward at first, but I made the switch, and I'm glad I did.  My point: if you and your boyfriend met in graduate school, you're both adults now.  If you met his mother as a colleague, you'd use her first name - there's no reason why you can't do that now.|`|6090e9e976038fa53ea3ba180daa45adaa	Just ask her by saying.... "Mrs. (last name)...Do you mind if I call your (first name)?"....  She realizes that you attended graduate school so in the USA you are of age to call her by her first name ... she will agree.|`|yMQf0ZMlaa	I'd continue to call her Mrs. until she says something like... "call me Cathy.." or something.  It's the normal etiquette that you address someone formally unless they say.|`|v84od8vraa	Its best that you stick to The Mrs. out of respect.

GeoiGjbCaa	@THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE <br>  <br>  "Moot point"<br>  <br>  No it isn't. Look up moot.<br>  <br>  "Atheists" have no right to try to destroy the traditions of all nations"<br>  <br>  How are we trying to "destroy tradition" by restoring the pledge to the way it was? It was religionists responding to the bogus "red tide" scare in the '50s that put it in there in the first place. But OOPS, I forgot - you kids seem to think that everything that was here as you grew up has ALWAYS been here, and you call it "tradition". I call it ignorance.<br>  <br>  "If you don't like it, no one is forcing you to live here."<br>  <br>  Right back atcha. Don't let the door hit you in the *** as you leave the country.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	I would continue to say "under God." <br>  <br>  Changing it to "Allah the Merciful" indicates that the pledge is only for Muslims. <br>  <br>  When we say "under God," it does not indicate any one religion in particular. Because Allah is the Arab name for God, then "God" in the pledge can refer to the Muslim God. Or to the Judao-Christian God.<br>  <br>  Or it can refer to the head of a pantheon. For example, in ancient Greece, Zeus was sometimes referred to as God. An example of this can be found in Antigone. <br>  <br>  Or, God can refer to nature. An example of this can be found in King Lear, Act 1 Scene 2, when Edmund says "Thou, nature, art my goddess," or in the quote from Frank Lloyd Wright, who said "I believe in God, only I spell it nature." <br>  <br>  "Allah the Merciful" is far too specific. Simply saying "God" is not because of the wide range of people/things to which the name "God" can refer dependent upon one's opinions and religious beliefs. I mean, I even have one friend who refers to Tim Curry as God.|`|u4B3pmqmaa	I would not say it then.<br>  I remember in elementary school I still wouldn't say the pledge sometimes I would just stand there with my hand over my heart. I just didn't agree with the fact that they MADE you say it. If you got caught not saying it then they would single you out and make you say it in front of the class, which was ridiculous. I never got caught though lol|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	I would care if it were changed to "allah" because this nation was NOT founded under allah, but under GOD.  Therefore, the change would not reflect the HISTORICAL FACT that this IS ONE nation, under GOD, indivisible.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a blessed day.|`|evStsOQiaa	Thanks to our new president our pledge will pretty soon say one nation under Charles Darwin. America will then be doomed by the very God that it no longer believes in.

I would not say it.|`|s4vGk4FLaa	Personally I think the pledge should have no referance to God. And Christians aren't the only ones who believe in God fyi, I do and I happen to be a Jew. Its not about God its about pledging allegiance to the nation. I don't say it because I dont believe in pledging to the flag, but thats me.|`|33c83940fcecbbe6ddde95b99b11f9cdaa	I think if it's changed it should just go back to the pre-1954 pledge when "under God" was not included.<br>  <br>  My faith is not grounded in a pledge...it's in Christ, the Waymaker, the True Savior Warrior.|`|OQVqrdd1aa	I'm atheist, and I would be ever so glad if it was changed. Just like what someone else said, separation of church and state is important to me, and in the Pledge of Allegiance, I skip the under god part.|`|kv7QdQHCaa	It's practically the same thing we have now, just one word in a different language and a brief description. They should change it back to the original.|`|gYmQSIaZaa	im not Christian, but I would be very happy if the pledge was changed....i dont say it anyway cuz there is SUPPOSED to be seperation of church and state....and im not gonna support something that contradicts that....but yeah thats just me|`|N3Xv1EMuaa	It's all the same to me, I just never say that part...<br>  <br>  I say the pledge as it was originally written, without a god reference...|`|bfea082903158e10a5c70aec1e9a662caa	I agree with the other answer I would still say under God.

However, I would like it to be changed back to before the whole war on Communism.<br>  <br>  @ The Truth Shall Set You Free, the chosen one: Sir, your pants have exploded.<br>  <br>  @ one_mans_opinion, Michelle, Colin, wyomugs: Except we're not a Christian nation as defined by the Treaty of Tripoli. The "under God" part was inserted in the 50s.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	Considering the fact that in america christianity is a supremacist movement, obviously they would flip the **** out.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To the person below me that says if atheists don't like it they can just omit it when they say the pledge, I tried that in middle school. I got sent to the principals office for it.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I wouldn't care. I don't say the pledge. My primary allegiance is to the Kingdom of God. My citizenship here is temporary, and while I am here, I don't pledge allegiance to inanimate objects like flags.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Well, now that I am an adult, I cannot remember the last time that I actually had to say the pledge of allegiance, but, if I had to, I would continue to say one nation under God.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Why do so many of you atheists have a hatred of the mere word GOD??<br>  <br>  If you don't like that part of the pledge, just omit it when you say it.  That simple|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Obviously people would flip out.<br>  <br>  I vote for either going back to the ORIGINAL with no God, or instructing people to either ignore it if they are atheist or to insert their own deity. Or people can just do that anyways :)
X9RoKfWPaa	Neptune and poseidon are considered to be the same god. Both are rulers of the sea the Romans based almost all their gods from the greeks exspecially the tweleve olympians. As for poseidon he had many lovers but never a wife he was said to love lots of goddesses, humans and nymphs just like his brother Zeus ( the play boy of ancient greece). His name meant "Husband of the Earth", and as a consort to the Titan Great Goddess Gaia (Mother Earth), Poseidon was originally worshipped as a fertility god. He also loved the gorgon Medusa who was the most beautiful of the gordons but she made the mistake to make love to him in the temple of athena and she was transformed into the monster that we know medusa as today. He also had an ability to over power many of the gods and liked to use force to get what he wanted. He raped the goddess demeter ( the goddess of autumn). When she was distraught and full of grief, searching for her daughter who had just been abducted. Discovering that she had turned herself into a mare and hidden inside a herd of horses to escape his unwanted advances, Poseidon simply transformed himself into a stallion and mounted her. But he did fall in love eventually to the sea goddess Amphitrite which he married her and had two of his children like the famous triton.|`|BvY47ts6aa	Poseidon has many wives and has fathered many heroes including Theseus, but the wife commonly associated with him was Amphitrite, a nymph and ancient sea-goddess, daughter of Nereus and Doris.<br>  Poseidon is Greek and his Roman counterpart is Neptune.For a time Neptune was paired with Salacia, possibly the goddess of the salt water.|`|Q24QcYB8aa	That's because the god Neptune and Posieden are the same god.<br>  <br>  His wives were Amphritrite and Cleito
BsfCZlMraa	When I get home I run to my room and change into a skirt or something comfy like track pants =P I hate school uniforms... <br>  lol, when no one else is home usually just a long shirt over bra and panties >.<|`|AA11156510	No doubt this will seem odd to some, but I'm usually in just my underwear at home, boxers or briefs.  I'm most comfortable that way, and I don't have anyone I need to cover up for, like kids or roommates.<br>  <br>  I think it started as a result of having to dress more formal for work.  I couldn't wait to get out of the office attire, and there was no need to put something else on if I wasn't going anywhere.<br>  <br>  I almost never have shoes on at home, much less sleep in them.|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	Tie Dye wrap and t-shirt.

xkBXhSppaa	Dear Jen<br>  <br>   The Holy Spirit does not and cannot lie.<br>  <br>  Pray to the Holy Spirit to give you the ability to listen to him clearly.<br>  Literally beg him.This is important so you will not face confusion but will be led by the Spirit. You are very emotional now trust that the Lord will send the right person at the right time. It's a big world out there<br>  and God is your only direction. The test is trusting him without a clue whats going on. Slowly he will lead you.|`|TOYeE0iraa	i personally dont think that the lord would do that to us. becasue saying that god gives us temptations or test is basically saying he is like the devil, so no i dont think he would do that. i think that god knows that you and your friend are not supposed to be together, if you like it or not thats hows its gonna go. later in life things might change but i think what he is saying right now is that RIGHT NOW you are not ment to be together|`|izXIAxXGaa	The more you get into it, the more you will be tested. It is just part of it. But it is definitely not a battle you want to wage on your own. I mean, ultimately, we enter and leave this world alone. You need to check with your support people at LDS and bible study and all that. How do they work with all this? You might consider joining, or forming a prayer group and relate this and other topics to the group.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	If God speaks to you, and you are one of His, you will have no doubt that it was God or His messenger who spoke.<br>  I don't think God (Holy Spirit) would  lie to you.  That is nonsense to think He is "testing you". The Bible says He cannot lie.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	try this, make a list of everything you want Mr. right to be and then compare it to this guy, this way you test the spirit.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	God does test us, but never through the Spirit!  The gift of the Holy Ghost is given to us as a protection and a source of comfort.  It's given to us so that we can know God's will for us, and so that we can know which path in life to take.  It is not given to us so that God can trick us, because that's not the way God works.  After all, if the Spirit is supposed to be a guide, why would God plant the seeds of doubt by using it to deceive us at any point?  If God wants us to trust in the Spirit, which of course He does, He can't use it in such a way.  <br>  <br>  In any case, God certainly never just wants to see if we're "listening."  When God sends a prompting, He does it only for our happiness and protection.  The Spirit can certainly be a tool, but it's not one that any of us should regard lightly.  If God only used it to see if we're paying attention, then it would become nothing more than the spiritual equivalent of a sound check on a microphone.  And if that were the case, wouldn't we all be less likely to listen in the end?  We'd always be wondering if God was just snapping figurative fingers in our faces, and the Spirit would lose it's power in our hearts.  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that promptings can never change, because that's also not true.  There have been plenty of times when I was told not to act, and then later given permission for that same action.  Each time, however, I was told to wait because the timing was not right for what I wanted to do, and I just hadn't been able to see it at the time.  The true blessing of constant guidance through the Holy Ghost is that each and every prompting will fit the circumstances.  And if the circumstances change, why couldn't the prompting?  Perhaps that is what's happening for you.  <br>  <br>  And perhaps not.  Only time will tell, but keep in mind that God has the big picture in mind.  At the moment, you may be regretting this aborted relationship with your friend, but years from now, when you have that someone else beside you, you may just be completely grateful that God was watching out for you.|`|bi3XdkMEaa	Dear Jen<br>  You are not the first one, who got a NO by the spirit.

It's contents are remarkably common except few like chlorophyl, centrosome, plastids, vacuoles etc.These cell constitute the whole body of an animal or a plant. <br>  <br>  Now basic difference being it's inability to create sound [ cry ] when broken /eaten /plucked, a plant or vegitable, can not make it eatable, ethically and logically. <br>  <br>  People eat vegitables just becoz they don't scream or cry or BLEED. The only purpose of production of fruits in the plants is to propagate it's kind and not to feed humen beings. Then why do we eat fruits or vegitables ? <br>  <br>  There may be a reason that blood of the killed animal generates guilty feeling, which is red and like ours becoz of hoemoglobin. But then the blood of plants, incidently not red, is as important as red blood. We love to kill kockroaches just becoz they dont have red blood. <br>  <br>  The canines are the teeth which are not found in Herbivorous animals. The fact that canines are present in humen beings make it clear that humen are Omnivorous as the God meant us to be. Humen are having long and very peculiar kind of intestine meant for digesting both meat & vegitables. The intestine of herbivorous animals can not digest meat. You can not feed meat to a sheep and grass to a lion. Can you ?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Moreover Non-veg diet is very essencial for the complete growth of children. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1366787.cms" rel="nofollow">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/artic...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  The following  is a warning for the vegeis.......... <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/html/uncomp/articleshow?msid=780050" rel="nofollow">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.d...</a> <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=8caef6f6-cf7c-46d8-bd41-1555aba67198" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/...</a><br>  <br>  And how do you justify the animal sacrifice?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nYA5yZBa6o&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nYA5yZBa...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bluecross.org.in/animalsacrifice.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluecross.org.in/animalsacrif...</a><br>  <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4131/309/1600/buffsacrifice.0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4131/...</a><br>  <br>   A sin is simply religious observation and since God has himself made us omnivorous, it is not at all a sin to eat non-veg like it is not a sin to eat vegitables & fruits. <br>  <br>  <br>  ...............|`|FfBll2n8aa	I'm a vegetarian because I choose to be, but I certainly don't try to push my beliefs onto my friends, who are mainly meat eaters. Of course I will always persuade them to try vegetarian food, but I don't think shoving my opinions down their throats will do anything to change their views.<br>  Having said that, my main objection to eating meat is the farming and slaughter practices, which lead to many incidents of cruelty to animals. Eating meat itself, isn't such a big deal to me - if the animals are treated with respect and compassion, and if their right to be free of pain and suffering was seen as more important than the almighty dollar, then I wouldn't have a problem with it. That's not the case though - animals will suffer unecessarily because of capitalism - I object to that so I don't buy the product. Simple.<br>  Your statement suggests that meat eaters are "violent" or at least more prone to it. You seem to have forgotten that the introduction of abattoirs and slaughter houses that take care of the killing and butchering of animals, keeping the unpleasantness of it away from public eyes, means that people are often not aware of what actually goes into their meat. The saying "out of sight, out of mind" really applies here. Eating meat is not a violent act, as the violence is kept hidden from view, and performed by a small number of people (slaughter house employees) onto whom society has pushed this whole unpleasant act, so we can all forget about that part of it.<br>  Humans have been killing animals for many thousands of years (and each other!) and have always been a violent race. Animal rights activists have also been known to be violent, despite their vegetarianism. Violence is in the human nature - diet has nothing to do with it.

Most people who deny that their own needs and concerns aren't the focus of their primary energies are just lying because they don't want to seem selfish.

Once I've satisfied my own needs and wants, I'm very happy to be charitable and involved in things that are part of the larger world.

U8Fwh38jaa	I don't.  And I teach my daughter a different path as well.  I don't understand why any woman would follow or believe in a religion that teaches they are inherently inferior.<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  In reply to another answer:  women were NOT stupid in the time the bible was supposedly written.  They were no more uneducated than men of the day.   Women had equal standing in the ancient pagan religions both socially and in religious circles.  Indeed many were leaders of their tribal lands.  When the patriarchal religion of christianity "took over," they could not stand the idea of women being in power or being equal to men in any way.  Hence the demonization of women in the bible. It started with the story of Eve.  It was a direct attempt to cast dispersion on women so the patriarchal religion and society could be enforced and that theme continued throughout the writings of the bible.|`|EiyhWrwwaa	It's easy to cherry pick the Bible, because it contradicts itself in so many places.<br>  <br>  You can balance all the misogynistic passages against Galatians 3:28.|`|i444oWjjaa	How can anyone, regardless of gender?|`|XITPweLEaa	I can't.

Women were uneducated at that time primarily because they spent a majority of their life on bed rest during pregnancy.  It wasnt a shame for them to speak in church because they were women.  It was a shame because it was expected that they were uneducated about the teachings.  Dont you think its rude when someone who knows nothing about the topic of conversation buts in to make comments that are way off base because they dont understand?<br>  <br>  All that being said, i dont believe in the Bible anyways.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Fairy tale.  Too sexist to be taken seriously.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	I went in search of a comprehensive explanation of women and silence and found one at <a href="http://www.wcg.org/lit/church/ministry/women9.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.wcg.org/lit/church/ministry/w...</a>  In short, it helps to understand the context in order to understand the meaning.  I apologize for the length, but in my defense, I felt a correction was due to the misunderstanding of the meaning of those Bible passages.  <br>  <br>  Just so you and everyone else knows, women in my church (and most others) behave as they do anywhere else.  We are free to speak, lead, teach, and not cover our heads.  I, myself, teach an adult class and a Sunday School Class.  Before that, I was the Sunday School Administrator and we have a woman for an Associate Pastor (and we are not a liberal church!).  Anyways, here are my quotes...<br>  <br>  "Conclusion: Although we cannot answer all questions about the specific situation Paul was addressing in Corinth, we do conclude that he was addressing a specific situation rather than making a general prohibition on women speaking in church. His intent was to prohibit disruptive and disrespectful questions and comments that were part of the chaotic Corinthian meetings—and in Corinth, these particular practices were coming from the women. Just as he told the disorderly tongues-speakers and prophets to control themselves because God is not a God of disorder, he also told the women to control themselves because the law teaches self-control. If they want to learn something, they can ask questions somewhere else.[43]<br>  <br>  Only one person should speak at a time. Everyone else, whether male or female, should be quiet, for it is disgraceful for people in the audience to be talking while someone else is speaking to the group. Just as Paul’s call for tongues-speakers or prophets to be silent should not be turned into a demand that they never say anything at all, so also his call for women to be quiet should not be turned into a demand that they never give messages of spiritual value in church. That is something that Paul specifically allows in chapter 11."<br>  <br>  Here is an explanation about the head covering from <a href="http://gracethrufaith.com/ask-a-bible-teacher/should-women-cover-their-heads-in-church/" rel="nofollow">http://gracethrufaith.com/ask-a-bible-te...</a><br>  <br>  "I believe that Paul was using a local custom to illustrate a timeless truth, and that is that our God is a God of order. He has established a hierarchy in His creation that begins with Him, then goes to Jesus, man and woman in that order. In the society of the day, a woman going out in public with her hair uncovered was a demonstrating her rebellion against that hierarchy. It was a sign that she was available, and therefore an insult to her husband. Paul was reminding them that our worship services are regularly attended by angels and out of respect for them we should be careful to adhere to the established order while in worship.<br>  <br>  Today the head covering for women is not customary, but we should still be careful to act in a manner that pleases the Lord and is acceptable in His sight, especially in worship. For instance how many people routinely show up late for worship, or fail to demonstrate the proper reverence while there, or in other ways by action or appearance distract other worshipers? Would they look or act this way if they could see their angelic visitors, or even the Lord Himself in their midst? Worship is not a time for musicians to show how talented they are or for worshipers to call attention to themselves by the way they act or look. It’s a time to pay homage to the Lord, to focus on Him, and to express our gratitude to Him. It’s not about us, it’s about Jesus."|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Bravo!  I've been saying this for decades!  The major 3 religions are degrading to women placing them lower than men.  Any thinking woman who could accept those teachings, deserves what she gets.|`|84gK4XlHaa	I don't.

JCGtfNeTaa	The last six of the 10 Commandments *ARE* the basis of our laws. When we steal, we come under the law. There are also laws against adultery (prostitution, etc). And laws against lying (perjury).<br>  <br>  And there is even the death penalty for certain crimes based upon the commandment: Thou shalt not murder.<br>  <br>  These last six commandments pertain to our relationship with other people.<br>  <br>  <br>  The first four commandments, which concern our relationship with God, should not be legislated in secular governments. God does not force people to worship Him, so neither should secular government.<br>  <br>  The Children of Israel were in a theocracy, under the direct government of God Himself (until they demanded to have a king, so they could be like the other nations). In God's government, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4), and on judgment day, we will be judged by this law of liberty, the royal law, which is the 10 Commandments (James 2:8-13).<br>  <br>  So while the Children of Israel were under the direct rulership of God (theocracy), the penalty for law breaking was death, as it always has been in God's government. This also applied to those who were not Israelites by nationality, but were Gentiles grafted in. We believers too, today, are Spiritual Israel, grafted in, and heirs according to the promise.<br>  <br>  Think back to Satan's sin, where he wanted to be God; and also back to the garden of Eden, where Eve sought to be wise like God and ate the forbidden fruit. The results of her and Adam's choice was sin, evil and death in this once-perfect world. This also was in God's theocracy.<br>  <br>  Sin and evil cannot be permitted to run rampant and unchecked and unpunished. One day soon, God will stamp out sin and evil, and affliction will not arise a second time. (Nahum 1:9)<br>  <br>  The heathen nations in the Old Testament times were guilty of great atrocities against mankind, and for this God judged them, using the Children of Israel as His sword of justice. God did not punish these heathen nations for breaking the Sabbath, for example, but for their atrocities against mankind.<br>  <br>  Government is ordained by God, and is His sword of justice today. (Romans 13) But again, secular government is not to force people to worship God.<br>  <br>  One day, we will once again live in a theocracy, when the Rock smashes the feet of the statue, turning  the statute into dust that will be blown away in the wind like chaff. That Rock becomes a mountain that fills the entire earth, and there will be no more sorrow, pain, nor death (Revelation 21:4-5) and God will dwell with us and be our God, and we shall be His people (Revelation 21:3; Zechariah 8:8)<br>  <br>  Once again, in Paradise restored, we will live in a theocracy where the 10 Commandment Law of God is absolute, as it was before sin entered this world.<br>  <br>  But we, having seen and experienced putridity and ugliness of sin first-hand, will have absolutely no desire for sin in our hearts, and with the law of God written on the tablets of flesh of our hearts (2 Corinthians 3:3; Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10; Hebrews 10:16), "affliction will not rise up a second time." (Nahum 1:9)|`|AA12288361	You mean, a theocracy government? As long as GOD is in control, it wouldn't be so bad. By the way, some of the Ten Commandments ARE already implemented in our laws. For example, "thou shall not kill".<br>  <br>  GOD bless|`|GQk0UNjfaa	That would be unconstitutional.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Which is why you want God as your leadership - not a government!

But putting that aside, most of the ideas of the 10 Commandments are valid.<br>  <br>  I've witnessed several thefts: sometimes they get away with it, and those who are caught usually get a slap on the wrist. That's unfair for those of us who work hard and pay hard money. It'd be a great way to curb crime in rampant areas. I think the Golden Rule, commandments against murder, and such are important to enforce.<br>  <br>  Death penalty? It'll act as a powerful deterrent, but is it necessary? Take a poor person who has been rendered homeless due to disaster, for instance. If he stole a piece of bread to feed himself and his kids, should we subject him to death?|`|N4ORX2fZaa	The same reason that Jesus needed to come is the same reason it wouldn't be good for the Government.

Your parents said "stay away from the neighbors we don't like them"....of course, you will do as your parents instruct you to and dislike the neighbors too. Your parents may not like the neighbors because their dog barks constantly at night. You will spend your entire life hating the neighbors because you were taught to. Got it?|`|hwIMJBVpaa	ignorance|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	Life experiences, I release hate through thought and music.|`|VhBW7AjAaa	Fear.<br>  <br>  People always fear things before they hate them. People insist on look too far into it, when in actuality it is much simpler.<br>  <br>  " There is no hate without fear. Hate is crystallized fear, fear's dividend, fear objectivized. We hate what we fear and so where hate is, fear will be lurking. Thus we hate what threatens our person, our liberty, our privacy, our income, our popularity, our vanity and our dreams and plans for ourselves. If we can isolate this element in what we hate we may be able to cease from hating. Analyse in this way the hatred of ideas or of the kind of people whom we have once loved and whose faces are preserved in Spirits of Anger. Hate is the consequence of fear; we fear something before we hate; a child who fears noises becomes the man who hates them."<br>  -Cyril Connolly|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	I don';t hate, I eradicate|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Misunderstanding, Ignorance, and Arrogance.<br>  <br>  --I usually keep quiet, and vent out quietly. I'm not good at expressing rage, and not feeling guilty about it.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	People doing or being something you don't like. For instance I hate liberals becuase they like to take away your freedoms. I hate muslim extremists because there mulsim extremists. I hate people that are anti-gun because they lie to push an agenda. I hate the fascist UK government because they have turned the country into "1984" in practice. I hate democrats because they are turning America into "Atlas shrugged" in practice.<br>  <br>  Usually a feeling of rage and disgust. And none if this would be there festering in me if they would leave the people alone. But you can't expect power mad politicians to do that.

pRF5LLloaa	What's to understand?<br>  <br>  Baptisis believe<br>  1) The Bible is the complete and correct Word of God.  This is called SOLA SCRIPTURA. There is no need for any other "explanatory" books, or "Third Testaments". [1 Timothy 3:16-17], There is also no need for one person on earth to be "closer" to God than any other, and in fact all on earth are (or can be) equally close to God [Matthew 23:9]<br>  2) In order to get into Heaven you must believe in God and His Word.[Matthew 22:37]  When you believe in His Word you must then also believe that Jesus is His Son.[John 6:29].<br>  3) When you admit that you believe God and His Word, and have accpet Jesus as His son and as the Savior of the world. God "saves" you.  He "saves" you from going to Hell.  [Ephisians 2:8]<br>  4) You canNOT ever be "good enough" to get into Heaven by you own actions.  Heaven is a place of perfection, and to get into Heaven you must be perfect, but that is not humanly possible.  So God has arrnaged so that when you believe in Jesus, the Son of God, then God Himself will save you because God wishes to honor His Son. [Acts 15:11, Ephisians 2:8-9] <br>  5) When you become "saved" you also become forgiven of ALL your sins -- past present, and future.  You do not need to ask Jesus to foirgive you, you only need to believe that He did so. {Matthew 26:29, Mark 3:28,]<br>  <br>  Basically, that is it.<br>  <br>  YOU need to attend church services with her, and MAKE THE EFFORT to learn the things she already knows.  It is NOT a good thing for a woman to know things that a man doesn't, ESPECIALLY if those things are of a spiritual nature.  tha man is supposed to be the spiritual leader in the relationship, but teh woman is NOT bound to follow him if his leadership goes against the Word of God!, Most mixed-faith relationships fail because the man does not meet his God-given obligation, or otherwise behave in a non-Godly manner.<br>  <br>  Don't choke on the technical terms.  If there is a problem, ASK the pastor after services.  He will be GLAD to explain it to you.  If that fails, go to a local Christian Bookstore, and ask them to point you to the necessary self-learning materials.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	I am a Baptist, here is the Baptist views in a nutshell:<br>  <br>  Doctrine is Bible only--no tradition, only scripture<br>  <br>  Salvation through faith, not works<br>  <br>  Baptism as a public act of faith, but is not required for salvation.  It is performed after a confession of one's salvation, and is usually required to be a formal member of a church. Once again, not held to be needed for actual spiritual salvation.<br>  <br>  Churches can coordinate with each other, but there is no hierarchy; each church is individual from one another. Likewise, all believers are held to be spiritually equal; you don't have to go through a priest, bishop, cardinal, pope etc. <br>  <br>  The primary heads of each church are one or more pastors, and multiple deacons.<br>  <br>  If you would like more information, feel free to email me.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Try this:<br>  <br>  Christianity Basics:  <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/newchristians/p/christianbasics.htm" rel="nofollow">http://christianity.about.com/od/newchri...</a>|`|PkBMMvqTaa	What exactly are you having trouble with?<br>  <br>  The only thing you need to come to understand is that you are a sinner.

My father was raised a Christian and has never, ever questioned it. He doesn't think deeply about it and merely accepts his faith and 100% truth, without thinking about WHY. That is dogmatic, and he will never form a dynamic faith if he does not THINK about the REASONS behind his beliefs, or how falliable it is, and why it still holds up.<br>  <br>  You can never properly defend your beliefs if you only have lists of no-no's.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Being dogmatic means that you already know the "correct" answers to all important questions.

The existence for the Holy Bible is for the purpose of informing humans on how to have a spiritual relationship with his or her Creator.  It is within this spiritual relationship that God comes "alive" to the believer.  The Bible is a book about history of the human experience, a book about prophecy to come, a book about the Good News for ALL humans that God loves them and desires a spiritual relationship with them.  It is a book about hope, in a world which teeters on the edge of nuclear war and impending self-inflicted doom .  This hope contained herein, assures the human race, whether they believe it or not, Jesus Christ will return to save us from total annihilation of our orb and that a reign of peace, abundance for all, and no more death - ever will prevail.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Wasn't the bible created as a book of common morals?<br>  <br>  No.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) You know, to keep people in line?<br>  <br>  Again:  no.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) Everyone cherry picks what they follow,<br>  <br>  Well, with respect to Christians - the bible tells us we can.

You have not learn!!!|`|grzQfnzNaa	From a Lutheran perspective, one just needs to believe in God and that Jesus died for our sins, then one knows they are going to heaven, and saved from hell,based on faith.<br>  <br>  My personal perspective: It seems a bit suspicious that the bible mentions recruiting (saving) as many people, by converting them to Christianity, as you can for their sake because you should love and care about everyone.  That type of behavior is just the sort of thing needed for a religion to survive and thrive for thousands of years, especially considering the images of hell which threaten those that don't convert.  Of course, back in the day, they apparently tortured many that didn't convert until they gave in, and that in itself might be how the concept of hell began.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Ok so im not like religious but sometimes i go to catholic churches for family things and the preachers always talk about how if you sin you go to hell,but then they say that God forgives your sins.<br>  <br>  Really?  A fire and brimstone Roman Catholic preacher?  That's a new one on me.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) So if that is really the case why was hell supposedly created?<br>  <br>  To punish the wicked.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) and if he forgives your sins<br>  <br>  This is the point which unhinges the logic of your question.  What if God does *not* forgive your sins?  What, exactly, does God require of you for your sins to be forgiven?  The doctrine of nearly *all* Christians is not, "everyone will be forgiven of all of their sins" but, rather, "Everyone *can* be forgiven of all of their sins.  That happens *if* they become faithful and obedient followers of Christ".  Oversimplifying:  Hell is for everyone who is *not* a "faithful and obedient follower of Christ."<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|FmazIF6Maa	Frankly I believe Christian leaders created the concept of hell in order to scare people into submission/conversion. <br>  <br>  Even Jews didn't believe in hell like that. It was a new idea interjected 400 years after Christ allegedly lived.
mQZDizMVaa	You're going through a normal phrase. At one time or another I believe we all question ourselves. It's a part of Life.<br>  <br>  You're on this earth in this space in time for a reason-there's something you have yet to fulfill. Try to find out what you're passionate about. Everyone has a skill they're good at, be it tapped or untapped, that boosts their self-confidence, esteem and self-gratification. Photography? Sewing? Drawing? Painting? Hiking? Astronomy? Tennis? Crafts? Tour bus day trips? Volunteer at a pet shelter? The list is endless. Join a club were you'll meet people with the same interests who will encourage you to stretch and grow.<br>  <br>  I worked in a hostile envirornment and tolerated a lot of b.s. I toughed it out by maintaining a life outside the workplace and when I retired, I turned that life into a part-time job that has given me more satisfaction and joy than I ever had when I worked full-time. I teach figure skating, and seeing kid's faces when we play "Simon Says" while incorporating beginner's skills, i.e. marching, gives me inner peace and a sense of accomplishment; plus I've met so many wonderful and encouraging people I wouldn't have met if I hadn't pursued this sport.<br>  <br>  Find your passion. And share it with others. You'll find your inner peace.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|q3KCDrMAaa	The problem with deciding that you don't care at 21 is that you honestly haven't lived or seen enough to KNOW that. I know you consider yourself philosophical, but can you think of a person alive under 21 who has LIVED? Even that chosen Buddhist guy, when they choose him at 10 or something, he honestly has no clue. <br>  <br>  Take inventory on life. Figure out WHAT you do like and do care about. There is going to be something if you are as philosophical as you say you are. Art, finance, business, psychology.... something. What about types of food? <br>  <br>  Don't just sit back and get old not caring about anything or at 60 you will honestly believe you don't care... Just try to pack some living in there before that time comes so you can make an rational, real choice to not care.|`|1fjzswl3aa	Give up materialism and learn to sit in peace: go to a park bench preferably by water (lake/ocean) and practice meditation: deep breathing and relaxing your muscles.<br>  <br>  Learn to appreciate the beauty of life around you and know that yes, it's all temporary but enjoy the moment.<br>  <br>  Help others/volunteer for the less fortunate for in so doing, you'll learn to appreciate what you have.|`|F0ImwHlUaa	You don't find inner peace, it finds you.

To find inner peace, you must find an inner meaning, I suppose.  There is no peace without meaning and understanding, therefore you should find it.  I'm not entirely sure you could find peace within yourself if you do not find a meaning to life and continue being a nihilist.<br>  If you do intend on finding a meaning, set some sort of goal and encourage yourself to accomplish it.  It can be any goal; just do it.  Also, change your major.  Go plan some trip to an exotic place alone, and your life will change.|`|UJbYeGMpaa	I turned to God, confessed with sorrow, that I was a sinner who has lied with my actions and words, who has been unjust, who has broken God's perfect laws, sorrow for having offended a perfectly kind and just God, my Creator. And I asked him to forgive me and knew he would, so I tusted that trusted that his one and only Son Jesus Christ had suffered the punishment for every time I had disobeyed God, past and future, and had been executed in my place for those sins. And since Jesus has been resurrected and remained perfect, and now that God is in me, I will love him forever and will one day be perfect just as he is.<br>  <br>  And no amount of silly thumbs down from God-haters will ever destroy the eternal life in me that my loving God his given me.<br>  <br>  You said, "I know that I can't look to anyone else or anything to make me happy. I have to make myself happy..."<br>  <br>  I ask you, how do you know this? So when you want to take pleasure in eating food, you don't look to food? So when you want to take joy in playing a game, you don't play a game? So if a person wants to be happy, they should lock themselves in darkness and sit there thinking about themselves all day? Being anti-social and ignoring what is around you does not bring happiness, that is a self-made prison.<br>  <br>  Here is what God has to say about deliberate hermits, monks, and nuns:<br>  <br>  "An unfriendly man separates himself; he defies all sound judgment." - Proverbs 18:1
6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	Graffiti subject of great debate between me and my 15yo grandson, who was arrested on his first "job".    I see it as vandalism of private and public property - and as a irresponsible intrusion and disfigurement of "the commons", or space we all share as a community.   He proclaims it is political action, and public art - and refers me to Banksy.  He also points out that most corporate and private architecture, and all public advertising,  is also an assault on public space   Those arguments impress me, but I am still offended by inescapable graffiti, wherever it is.   We do both agree that the scribbling of  "tags" is infantile - a kind of psychotic "look at me".    All this said, I remember an isolated church amongst the ruins of civil war in a Spanish village.   Hugely scrawled on a standing wall were the simple words "God is dead".   Nothing could have spoken more eloquently for the despair of those villagers, or evoked the personal presence of the artist and his/her disillusion so vividly - nor could it have done so in any other place.   A painting or photo of that image in an art gallery would not be so powerful, would it.   I wept, though I am an atheist, and my scalp still creeps for the savage folly of humanity when I think of it, decades later.    So location does matter.  And the act of transgression is a vital part of the work, just as the materials are.    But it's a cop-out, in a way.   There are other, legal and available means of making public statements, and fighting to change the mindless ways we live..   The challenge is to use them and leave "the commons" we all share, free.   And avoid a police record into the bargain.    It just requires more imagination, intelligence, skill, and persistence over time than most graffiti does.  The same is true of  all vandalism, and terrorism.  Good luck|`|sgRJRuvgaa	Oh yes.<br>  Vandalism on any one's property in any form whether it's visible or not or cared about is a crime and punishable.

AA12204752	You did the right thing. People are not paying attention to what is really going on ahead of them. By hitting the brakes and honking your horn, you were letting others know that you were obviously stopping for a reason. What if it would have been a human being?|`|aCrILRS9aa	No it wasn't wrong if they would have payed attention to you maybe the poor kitty would still be alive|`|nWHNbKIfaa	it wasn't wrong but unsafe|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	It was kind of you to try to help the cat but it was unsafe to the other drivers. You have to remember that cars traveling 40 miles an hour, especially trucks, take a long time to stop. If they see your brake lights, everyone is going to slam on their brakes and possible cause a pile up accident. At that speed, people can die. When driving, you have to decide if the life of an animal in the road is worth risking the life of humans in other cars. It's a heartbreaking decision to make. Whose life is more valuable, the cat's life or the mother and her three young children in the car behind you?|`|AA11156510	No, it was not wrong of you to brake and honk twice.  You tried to alert other drivers to the presence of the cat because it was in danger.  Unfortunately, drivers today are often in too much of a hurry to recognize and register cues like the ones you put out there.  Rather than wonder why you've slowed down or honked, they're more anxious to just get around you and be on their way.  What makes it even sadder is most drivers, I think, would have done everything within their power to avoid the cat if they'd been aware of it - even those who were too impatient to catch your warning.|`|AA11616515	I understand your reaction, even though I have no love for cats. But only bake when no one is behind you unless you can do it safely {never as a reaction}. And never swerve unless you are traveling slowly and are all alone on a road, and even at that be cautious.

As if the belief in God is a prerequisite to believing in anything at all.<br>  <br>  As an atheist I generally believe in anything that religious people believe in, except for the stuff that relies on religion specifically. So I believe that you shouldn't kill or steal, for instance. As for how the world got started, that depends on what you mean by world.

wRBfUgI2aa	It is the reason for our hard work in addition to being told to do so by Jesus at Matt.24:14; 28:19-20.<br>  <br>  The "good news of the kingdom" back then was that the king of that kingdom was there standing among them.  He had experience with our human problems.  A definite plus in a ruler.<br>  <br>  Today, it is God's Kingdom is ruling in heaven and will shortly begin clearing the earth of all the corruption rampant all over the planet today.  In the place of all human governments will be God's Kingdom rule.  Only by this will any real solutions and the power to do so be done.  Not only paradise conditions on earth but for humans, a return to the perfection of Adam and fulfillment of Rev. 21:4.  Promising an end to death itself as well as no more reason for tears or crying due to pain or sorrow that disease or death brings.<br>  <br>  Jehovah is the Lord of the harvest.  It is he who makes the crops grow although others do their parts of watering, planting, cultivating.  The plants are the people of earth.  How many billions?  Conditions are getting worse and though we might be a bit naive, it is hard to believe how much more humans can take.  So it is of vital importance more workers to spread the life saving message get going to reach all those who must be contacted or contacted again.|`|AA11703455	You are on target with that last question.<br>  <br>  Jesus' activity helped his people, and seeing them abandoned by the clerical system that the Jews had put in place, he felt pity for them.<br>  Mark's words reflect that at 6:34<br>  <br>  34?Well, on getting out, he saw a great crowd, but he was moved with pity for them, because they were as sheep without a shepherd. And he started to teach them many things.<br>  <br>  Spiritually speaking (HELP I FOUND I USED THE PHRASE AND MEAN IT!) the Jews should have been spiritually rich, with the center of true worship, and a body of priests that finally didn't allow the false worship that plagued the nation for centuries. But they had made it a formalized religion, with customs that overran the teachings of the law. <br>  <br>  Matthew 23 shows that the leaders had changed their purpose, from shepherds, to masters and ones that would not do what they laid upon the "common" people to do.<br>  <br>  Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying: 2?“The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the seat of Moses. 3?Therefore all the things they tell YOU, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for they say but do not perform. 4?They bind up heavy loads and put them upon the shoulders of men, but they themselves are not willing to budge them with their finger. 5?All the works they do they do to be viewed by men; for they broaden the [scripture-containing] cases that they wear as safeguards, and enlarge the fringes [of their garments]. 6?They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues, 7?and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by men. 8?But YOU, do not YOU be called Rabbi, for one is YOUR teacher, whereas all YOU are brothers. 9?Moreover, do not call anyone YOUR father on earth, for one is YOUR Father, the heavenly One. 10?Neither be called ‘leaders,’ for YOUR Leader is one, the Christ. 11?But the greatest one among YOU must be YOUR minister. 12?Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.<br>  <br>  So, today it is the same. There is a harvest time in progress. Christendom should be a place of peace and richness in understanding of Jehovah's purpose. But instead, they removed the name of the God of the Bible from their Bibles, they have no idea of what the Kingdom of God, and as such, do not preach the "good news of the kingdom". The clerical systems honor the United Nations as "the last hope of mankind" Both Popes, Paul VI and John Paul II declared this at the UN. <br>  <br>  Was this just recently?<br>  <br>  When Britain and America took the lead in proposing the League of Nations in 1918, the churches of Christendom gave wholehearted support. The Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America hailed it as “the political expression of the Kingdom of God on earth.” What blasphemy! To say that a combine of the political nations of Satan’s world could be God’s kingdom on earth! A disgusting thing, an abomination, indeed, in the sight of Jehovah and of those truly standing in the “holy place” as ambassadors on earth of the now ruling “heavenly Jerusalem”! And what have the world’s clergy said of the League’s successor, the United Nations? They have described it variously as ‘the sole hope of survival’ for mankind, “the last hope of concord and peace” and the “supreme forum of peace and justice.” As with the League of Nations, they place it in “a holy place” by claiming that it will bring about what God’s kingdom alone is capable of accomplishing.<br>  <br>  The clergy of Christendom have opted for putting the UN in “a holy place” that rightly belongs to the “heavenly Jerusalem,” God’s kingdom, and to the “holy ones” representing it on earth. But there is nothing “holy” about the UN. It has its prayer chapel and its Buddhist bell, and inscribed on its plaza wall are the words of Isaiah 2:4 (AV): “They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” But these things do not make it “holy.” Its member nations are squabbling continually one with another, and an impressive number of them are now antireligion, anti-God. However, in another sense, also, we find “the disgusting thing .?.?. standing in a holy place.”<br>  <br>  Jesus is of course the Lord of the harvest, and those whom he has commissioned to look after his interest, he has put in charge of that harvest. Matthew 24:45,46|`|AA12186845	My guess is this teaching is all about working together to solve problems of hunger.<br>  <br>  People need to work together to get a good harvest.<br>  <br>  Like a soup kitchen, you need many good people to help out to serve the food and drinks to the homeless and the poor folks. <br>  <br>  That is why sometimes religion helps people feel better.|`|sErzwOnSaa	It's a commandment to bear our testimonies or "preach". <br>  It's a commandment to love our neighbor which is accomplished by service.

Thoughts can be measured through electrical impulses, and their pathways are indicative of their contents. However, I think that freewill is an illusion, and so if we can figure out how the conscious works, we should be able to predict near future events. However, the environment really influences decisions. For example, we might be able to predict what you will think about as you leave the building, but not much after that, because who knows what you will think if a taxi almost hits you!|`|Ve18FAnGaa	one of yahoo's headlines the other day was actually about a study using a technology that could best be likened to sonar for studying brain activity.  the researches had developed a theory that they would be able to guess simple yes/no pos/neg reactions using this and when they set the whole thing up they discovered that their machine and software had an 80% (ish) success rate at predicting how subjects would react to choices between two common options.  things like 'coke or pepsi,' or 'tea or coffee.'|`|eDYXQxA9aa	Seriously?

He doesn't stop us because he gave us that free will|`|7f65e028a9299be65138de1d8d61b165aa	Umm, yeah, I guess you can't choose to fly because God's gravity plan.|`|bOiAHI8paa	no|`|mGTjFgCwaa	I think a belief in a divine "plan" limits free will. If everything happens for a reason, it was planned before you did it. You didn't originally think it up, because someone told you to do it, even if you don't realize it.<br>  <br>  A belief in free will cannot coincide with a plan.<br>  <br>  I would rather define god's "plan" as an action caused by a feeling. If you feel moved by the "holy spirit" (or mother nature, or whatever...) to do something, because it feels like the right thing to do, or a good thing for someone else, that is an exercise of free will influenced by your faith. Doing something for the sake of a plan is not.|`|47TSqkEGaa	No, your free will was given to you by God. He does not limit your free will. There are doors that are meant to be opened at a certain time that are within God's plan. If you force those doors open (such as diving into a new relationship after you just broke up or got broken up with) then God will show you how that door was not meant to be opened. He will pave a new route for you to take. The Lord only wants what's better for His people.|`|1GZ8nrjyaa	Practically speaking, there have been times in my life when some very good things happened (as the Quakers say) "as way opened."<br>  <br>  So my free will is partly limited by circumstances, and sometimes life has some wonderful surprises.<br>  <br>  But if you want a more "rational" way of looking at this question, think about quantum mechanics.  One solution to the quantum equations (the "probability wave" equations, if you're interested) is the "many worlds" solution--in which every possible quantum event that can happen, does happen.  And they all happen at the same time.  They just don't all happen in the same universe--each possible outcome occurs in a different universe (or family of universes).<br>  <br>  So for every choice you make, there is another version of "you" in another universe, that makes a different choice--several versions of you, in fact, that make every possible choice.<br>  <br>  Even in a simple true/false choice, there are an infinite number of copies of you, in an infinite number of universes, that choose "true," and another infinite number of copies of you, in another infinite number of universes, that choose "false."<br>  <br>  So actually, it's rather like "no free will" in reverse:  You (or some other version of you) actually make every possible moral choice.  No wonder the distinction between "saints" and "sinners" is pointless.|`|6zoZ75JQaa	No way jose!! God has wonderful plans for us (Jeremiah 29:11-14) and he doesn't want us to stumble. He only wants the best for us--we're his children, remember? :)<br>  However, he doesn't want a bunch of robots professing their love for him. he wants us to CHOOSE to love him! He chose us! Ephesians 1: 4 "For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight." Jon 15:16 "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name." <br>  If you think about it, it wouldn't make sense for a God full of love and emotion to create humans without freewill. He's like us--he wants to be loved and adored and cherished! But I KNOW that if I programmed a robot to say "I love you" it wouldn't be the same as someone looking me in the eye and sincerely telling me that--showing me and proving to me that they love me. Robots can't prove it. That's why we have free will. <br>  Some argue that free will can't coincide with a divine plan. It seems impossible, but it apparently can. See, God has a wonderful plan for you, but he gave free will. Of course, we mess up the plan, and it's on to plan B, C, D, and so on. If you read Psalm 139, though, you will know that God knows everything about you--EVERYTHING! He knows what you will say in 2 years, 3 months, 7 days, 4 hours, and 8 seconds. He's just that good! Of course it's hard for us to understand freewill with the plan--we don't think like God! Our knowledge is that of a mustard seed compared to his! Isaiah 55:8 "'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways' declares the LORD. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts than your thoughts.'" <br>  It's not supposed to make sense to us. We're supposed to have faith! That's what it's all about. :)|`|zrkyw6dXaa	uh yeah. free will means your will god's plan is god's will. I just don't understand how these people aren't getting that. oh yeah another trick they use is people should use their free will to believe in God. ha ha how desperate

Remember; the Bible is not a science book nor was it ever intended to be.  God caused the writers [Moses] in this case] to give a brief summary of Adam & Eve's progeny.  True science and true Biblical truth will complement one another.   Again; the Bible is not a science book but a book, which instructs a human being in how to live.  It is a book, that contains history, prophecy, and instruction in having a spiritual relationship with ones Creator.

Adam and Eve remain relevant in the context of religion as being symbolic of the first man and woman.<br>  <br>  Scary to think that people happily accept without hesitation the incest in Genesis theory before anything else.

That says it all.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  I think homosexual attraction and activity are both disordered.   This has been the common sense of virtually all societies in recorded history.  People sometimes refer to the ancient Greeks having permitted homosexual activity between male teachers and their teenage students.  How common that was, I don't know.  It sounds to me like abuse that was permitted by society.  <br>  <br>  I think people with any disordered sexual desires have the duty of controlling their urges.  Human beings are not doomed to commit every act we are attracted to commit.  In my opinion,  homosexual activity is  contrary to natural laws,  whether or not  homosexual attraction is something that is chosen.<br>  <br>  I think it is wrong to encourage people to act on the sexual urges of adolescence.  I think it is seriously wrong to encourage people to act on homosexual curiosity when they are only in their teens.  That is a time when most people are fairly poor at thinking clearly about a great many things.   One of the reasons I think homosexual activity should not be encouraged is that it will never be truly accepted by people.<br>  <br>  Most people are not genuinely welcoming of open homosexual activity.  Some people compare it to inter-racial sexual activity,  but that simply is not true.   Societies throughout history have had various social rules about inter-racial relationships,  and most such relationships have been accepted in most societies.  That is not true about homosexual relationships.<br>  <br>  I think so-called "homosexual marriage" is an absurdity.  There never has been any such thing, and there never will be any such thing.  For us to pass laws that claim such an absurdity exists is to make a mockery of the entire legal system.  Marriages are between opposite sex persons.   <br>  <br>  Regardless of all these things,  I consider it utterly wrong to abuse, harass, or otherwise be hostile to people who are homosexual by preference or by their actions.   I do think it is OK for people to choose not to associate with others who are homosexual.    I think anyone who has a homosexual preference should be celibate.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you,  and with all people.
7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	I think you're talking about should we follow laws that the government brings forth. And the whole dishonesty factor that Moses' mother and even the midwives played in Exodus. <br>  <br>  Exodus 1: 15-19<br>  <br>  15  ? And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:<br>  16  And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.<br>  17  But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.<br>  18  And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?<br>  19  And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Because Pharaoh was asking for something that the midwives knew in their hearts was wrong and they feared God rather than the ruler of a government. So they willfilly disobeyed the king's law. <br>  <br>  Moses mother basically did the same thing. She knew that the Pharaoh's edicts were wrong in the eyes of God and so she hid her son. <br>  <br>  Their is no easy answer in modern times on how we should act.

However, if the laws go against what God tells us then in good conscious we cannot follow them. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps answer your question|`|JTu1cLkYaa	The LDS Church uses the King James Version of the Bible.

6Q4xh4F1aa	Many jw's believe that Jesus died for all men, but the plain fact is that the watchtower society teaches that Jesus only died for 144,000 and is only the Mediator between God and THEM.  This is contrary to what the Bible teaches, but so many of the watchtwoer's teachings are not Biblical that it isn't a big surprise to those who understand the inworkings of this cult.---<br>  <br>  Worldwide Security Book, p. 10: "Jesus Christ is not the Mediator between Jehovah God and all mankind. He is the Mediator between his heavenly Father, Jehovah God, and the nation of spiritual Israel, which is limited to only 144,000 members."<br>  <br>  Consequently, 1 Timothy 2:5, 6 is not using “mediator” in the broad sense common in many languages. It is not saying that Jesus is a mediator between God and all mankind. Rather, it refers to Christ as legal Mediator (or, “attorney”) of the new covenant, this being the restricted way in which the Bible uses the term. Jesus is also a corresponding ransom for all in that covenant, both Jews and Gentiles, who will receive immortal life in heaven. The apostle John referred to these at 1 John 2:2. But he indicated that others too will receive the benefit of Christ’s sacrifice: “He is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s.”  (Watchtower of 8/15/1989 Page 31, Questions From the Readers)<br>  <br>  Screenshots from my WT CD-ROM:<br>  <a href="http://i429.photobucket.com/albums/qq19/Watchtower_Facts/Attorney.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i429.photobucket.com/albums/qq19/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i429.photobucket.com/albums/qq19/Watchtower_Facts/mediator144000.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i429.photobucket.com/albums/qq19/...</a>|`|rcCsFXpoaa	Do Jehovah's Witnesses believe Jesus died for all of our sins ?<br>  <br>  QiA has answered this WITH PROOF....yet the thumbs down come for telling the truth of what the JW's believe....strange...it seems that the thumbs down come from those in denial...blind dogs.|`|CGnL2nS0aa	JW's believe, according to what the Bible teaches, Jesus died for ALL men.<br>  <br>  Plain and simple!|`|zyxY4dbMaa	no  JW's teach that those Jesus died for have a heavenly calling. very few---- The earthly class are still bound to works|`|qKSn0AVsaa	The Bible explains: “Christ died for our sins.” “He died for us, that .?.?. we should live.” (1?Corinthians 15:3; 1?Thessalonians 5:10) Yes, Jesus was sent to earth to save us. He himself said: “The Son of man came .?.?. to give his soul [or, life] a ransom in exchange for many.” (Matthew 20:28) But what does it mean that Jesus gave his life as “a ransom”? What is a ransom?<br>  <br>  The word “ransom” is often used when there is a kidnapping. After a kidnapper captures a person, he may say he will return the victim if a certain amount of money is paid as a ransom. So a ransom is something that brings about the deliverance of a person held captive. It is something that is paid so that the person does not lose his life. Jesus’ perfect human life was given to obtain mankind’s release from bondage to sin and death. (1?Peter 1:18, 19; Ephesians 1:7) Why was such a release needed?<br>  <br>  It was needed because Adam, our forefather, rebelled against God. (Genesis 2:17; 3:11, 12) His lawless act thus made him a sinner, since the Bible explains that “sin is lawlessness.” (1?John 3:4; 5:17) As a result, he was not worthy of receiving God’s gift of everlasting life. (Romans 6:23) So Adam lost for himself perfect human life on a paradise earth. He also lost this wonderful prospect for all the children he would produce. ‘But why,’ you may ask, ‘did all his children have to die, since it was Adam who sinned?’<br>  <br>  This is because Adam, when he became a sinner, passed sin and death on to his children, including all humans now living. (Job 14:4; Romans 5:12) So humans have been dying because of the sin that they inherited from Adam. How was it possible, then, for the death of Jesus to free all people from bondage to sin and death?<br>  <br>  A legal principle in God’s law for the nation of Israel is involved. It states that ‘life should be given for life.’ (Exodus 21:23) By his disobedience the perfect man Adam lost perfect life on a paradise earth for himself and all his children. Jesus Christ gave his own perfect life to buy back what Adam lost. As the Bible explains, Jesus “gave himself a corresponding ransom for all.”—1?Timothy 2:5, 6.|`|vM9CxOKKaa	Yes for all who wanted to exercise faith in Jesus.<br>  <br>  (John 3:16) .?.?.“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.?.?.<br>  <br>  I emphasise exercise because a lot of people seem to think that since Jesus has died nothing else is required and all are saved. Now notice this scripture:<br>  <br>  (John 3:36) .?.?.He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.?.?.<br>  <br>  So this shows that if we take a lax attitude God will not forgive. See this scripture:<br>  <br>  (Matthew 25:31-46) .?.?.When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. 32?And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33?And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. 34?“Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, YOU who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for YOU from the founding of the world. 35?For I became hungry and YOU gave me something to eat; I got thirsty and YOU gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and YOU received me hospitably; 36?naked, and YOU clothed me. I fell sick and YOU looked after me. I was in prison and YOU came to me.’ 37?Then the righteous ones will answer him with the words, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty, and give you something to drink? 38?When did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably, or naked, and clothe you? 39?When did we see you sick or in prison and go to you?’ 40?And in reply the king will say to them, ‘Truly I say to YOU, To the extent that YOU did it to one of the least of these my brothers, YOU did it to me.’ 41?“Then he will say, in turn, to those on his left, ‘Be on YOUR way from me, YOU who have been cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels. 42?For I became hungry, but YOU gave me nothing to eat, and I got thirsty, but YOU gave me nothing to drink. 43?I was a stranger, but YOU did not receive me hospitably; naked, but YOU did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but YOU did not look after me.’ 44?Then they also will answer with the words, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you?’ 45?Then he will answer them with the words, ‘Truly I say to YOU, To the extent that YOU did not do it to one of these least ones, YOU did not do it to me.’ 46?And these will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”<br>  <br>  ....................................<br>  <br>  You notice that there is a dividing of the righteous from the unrighteous and they have different destinations, everlasting life and alternatively destruction.<br>  <br>  It is said by many out there that this scripture means that unrighteous go to pergatory, limbo, hell of tormant etc. But this is incorrect because the Bible makes it clear that there is a destruction of those undeserving.<br>  <br>  (Matthew 7:13-14) .?.?.“Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; 14?whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.<br>  <br>  Notice the word destruction verses life! Now if you were to take the interpretation of the many in the world, you would say all were saved. Don't be fooled, Jesus was not making light when he said these words. He said FEW ARE THE ONES FINDING IT. Go along with the majority and the consequences will be detrimental.|`|NWa45ZDIaa	Jesus died for all of our sins.

2b5799147194d19d72182c8e2216fa41aa	This is a great question, I would like to start this answer off by sharing some verses from this chapter.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:<br>   2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, <br>  <br>  I love how this starts, Jesus sees the multitudes and He went up into the mountain, and He opened His mouth and taught them. This blesses me so much, the words of the Lord are so precious, and I feel like this second verse best answers your question, the purpose that Jesus spoke these words was to teach us.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.<br>  <br>  It says that Jesus opened His mouth and taught them, it is from the mouth of the Lord that knowledge and understanding comes. <br>  In Jesus Christ is all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.<br>  <br>  Colossians 2:3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. <br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br>   17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.<br>  <br>  I do love these verses too, and we know that it applies to all scripture that God gave us. I can see how each one of these applies to the verses from the sermon on the mount, but I would like to talk about two in particular; " For correction, " and for " instruction in righteousness".<br>  <br>  One of the things I see about these words that Jesus Christ spoke is that He was correcting our value system, and also instructing us on how to be righteous. Look at the times where Jesus said " blessed are ",  so many of these things to our natural eyes doesn't look like it is something to be desired, but Jesus said these were blessed. He was teaching us the value of these things in God's eyes, these things are lightly esteemed by the natural man, but are of great value to God.<br>  Our hearts need to line up with God's values.<br>  <br>  Matt. 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <br>  <br>  Must of us don't see being poor or lacking in any way as being blessed.<br>  But it is the poor in spirit, those that acknowledge they are lacking that are blessed. Those that can see and recognize that they need Jesus, they have a deep need in their spirit for the Lord, these are blessed. Those that think they are full, they think they lack nothing, they don't know or realize that they need Jesus, they may think they have lived a good enough life, and trust in their own ways instead of confessing that they are empty inside and that they need Jesus Christ,  they don't know their true state, and so these are the ones that are in worse condition.<br>  <br>  Revelation 3: 17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:<br>   18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.<br>   19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.<br>   20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. <br>  <br>  So by showing us what is truly valuable, the Lord was correcting what we value in our hearts so that we can see how precious these things  really are, and how  valuable they are to God.<br>  <br>  He was also instructing us in righteousness. I would like to use a verse farther down to show this. ( although they all apply )<br>  <br>  Matt. 5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br>   45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. <br>  <br>  We can see that the things that Jesus tells us to do doesn't come naturally to us, to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; These go against our carnal desires, but Jesus was instructing us in righteousness. Notice in verse 45 that it says, " That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven " and afterward it shows us something about God's character, and that He has called us as His children, to walk in His ways, and He has enables us through our Lord Jesus Christ to walk His will in our life out, we can't do it on our own, it is Christ in us that allows us to walk out God's will.<br>  <br>  <br>  with much love and sincerity in Christ,<br>  andrew|`|0sEspN5baa	That the poor in spirit, those who mourn,<br>  those who are meek, those who hunger<br>  and thirst for righteousness, who are <br>  merciful, who are pure of heart, who are<br>  peacemakers, and who are persecuted<br>  for the sake of righteousness<br>  are blessed.<br>  <br>  It's not if you win the race<br>  It's not if you get 1st 2nd or even 3rd place<br>  But it is about<br>  HOW you run the race<br>  and how you keep an even pace<br>  amidst the oppression & sorrow,<br>  and how you keep a compassionate<br>  face and lend an understanding ear,<br>  and that there is a place for all who<br>  labor and are heavily burdened.<br>  <br>  Do not despair, the prize is already<br>  there.<br>  <br>  This is an uplifting affirming and supporting<br>  Scripture.<br>  <br>  Probably many of us can identify with one<br>  or more of them ----<br>  <br>  thanks for the Q :)|`|XKzUsb7zaa	people who follow the beatitudes will be happy or blessed.|`|fovMmVBYaa	To give us hope.|`|eSfCTgHAaa	The beatitudes define the type of people who enter in Jesus' Kingdom - the Kingdom of Heaven.

This is what a spiritually mature Christian will look like.  It requires time and experience with God to BECOME these things.  Good question presented.|`|sgHvnxe2aa	To show us the way of living and the heart attitude that we should strive'to develop and live by as believers, for the glory of God and as a witness to the world - unsaved -- of God's love, just as 1 Cor.13 gives a<br>  picture of what walking in love is all about and how it reflects the very nature of what God is like....despite the false accusations that are con-stantly being thrown in His face down through the ages.....<br>  <br>  God does NOT bring suffering and death and disaster into this world <br>  anymore than He "sends" anybody to hell....He sent His Son to the cross to KEEP us out of hell, but what does He get for it -- in terms of<br>  RESPECT and GRATITUDE that He CARES enough not to want ANY of us to perish for all eternity...and He was willing to pay the price that it took to provide our redemption from satan...Satan is the one who would have us to die and GO DIRECTLY TO HELL -- Do not pass goal, Do NOT collect $200 -- God is the One Who GIVES us the CHOICE as<br>  to where we want to spend eternity - and we WILL spend it somewhere<br>  --- but He is constantly accused of being the One Who WANTS man to<br>  go to hell for every little thing he's done....If He wanted that, He could have walked away from mankind from the moment that Adam disobeyed Him...and sold us all out to satan, letting him come in and take over...But, NO, God already had our salvation planned and in His mind, it was FAIT ACCOMPLI before the foundation of the world...and even with everything He's done to save us, He will not EVER force His will on any of us, as much as it grieves Him for anyone to die without asking Jesus to save them and being condemned to hell forever. That is the choice of all who REFUSE to repent before God....God will honor<br>  their choice, but they have NO RIGHT to come back and BLAME HIM for "sending" people to hell for all eternity!!!  If someone really does not want to go to hell, why don't they come to Jesus and ask Him to save him/her. No one is trying to KEEP them OUT of Heaven...God WANTS<br>  them IN HEAVEN....FOREVER......  (2 Cor.5:20-21 - John 3:16-21)<br>  <br>  Very good question :-) I love the Beattitudes.... :-)|`|FvoxgjbJaa	Explanations of each verse in Matt. 5:3-10 according to Haydock DRB:<br>  <br>  The poor in spirit signifies the humble of mind and heart.<br>  <br>  The land of the living or the kingdom of heaven. The evangelist prefers calling the land of the living in this place to show that the meek, the humble, and the oppressed who are spoiled of the possession of this earth by the powerful and the proud, shall obtain an inheritance of a better land.<br>  <br>  Not those that mourn for worldly motives, but such as mourn for their sins are blessed. The sorrow that is according to God, says St. Paul, worketh penance steadfast unto salvation, but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<br>  <br>  Hunger and thirst; i.e. spiritually, with an earnest desire of being just and holy. But others again understand such as endure with patience the hardships of hunger and thirst; those to whom justice is denied, such as poor widows and orphans.<br>  <br>  Not only the giving of alms, but the practice of all works of mercy both corporal and spiritual, are recommended here, and the reward will be given on that day when God will repay every one according to his works, and will do by us, as we have done by our brethren.<br>  <br>  The clean of heart are either those who give themselves to the practice of every virtue, and are conscious to themselves of no evil, or those who are adorned with the virtue of chastity. For nothing is so necessary as this purity in such as desire to see God.<br>  <br>  To be peaceful ourselves and with others, and to bring such as are at variance together, will entitle us to be children of God. Thus we shall be raised to a participation in the honor of the only begotten Son of God, who descended from heaven to bring peace to man, and to reconcile him with his offended Creator.<br>  <br>  Heresies and malefactors suffer occasionally, but they are not on this account blessed, because they suffer not for justice. For, says St. Augustine, they cannot suffer for justice who have divided the Church; and where sound faith or charity is wanting, there cannot be justice.

h6eFkvL8aa	The other people who responded to this question have covered most of the people who should receive a card. But, I think that there are a couple of more people. First, the pall bearers. Next a short note to the staff at the funeral home, next the organist. They make everything work smoothly, but rarely get any type of remembrance. If you like how your father was prepared, then mention that in the note. I would also suggest a short note to the cemetery, thanking them for their work, and the way they keep the graves and areas of the cemetery looking good. A short note like this can do wonders when it comes to keeping your dad's grave looking good.|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	Anyone to whom you are thankful!<br>  <br>  -- Those who sent flowers, food, gifts, contributions, etc.<br>  -- Those who sent condolence notes/letters.<br>  -- Those who visited and helped with arrangements, or such.<br>  -- Those who visited and brought you comfort in your time of loss.<br>  <br>  See?  <br>  <br>  My sister recently died in a tragic car accident, and my mother had to write nearly 100 thank you notes to ALL those to whom she was thankful.

This is considered creative and sometimes more. <br>  <br>  Visualizing something, is thought, to bring that image into this world, by some cultures. <br>  <br>  For those that can defy logic and science with visualizing beyond the realm of common knowledge, they can see things that are impossible.

There is much unexplained about this. I can tell you that I have had many dreams that last more than just a while. The longest one was a three thousand year dream. This was all in the mind, but I remember a lot of it and the different points that referenced the length of time that had passed. It was a lot like being humbled by mountains for the first time. The memories of this dream come to me often, like that of memories past. This dream was very vivid and went though ages. I could write for the rest of my life on this dream and never get through the first part. What was nice about the dream is that I had a lot of control, like lucid, and traveled everywhere within this dream-scape. <br>  <br>  Other dreams explain issues that I have had problems with, while some persue current actions and plans to their ends. To me it is my workspace, and sometimes a vacation. <br>  <br>  With this I strongly understand the importance of having my feet on the ground while I am awake. <br>  <br>  Dreams are a part of us, and therefore a part of the universe.

For instance if you meet them at a party thrown in their honor, make a comment about what the party is about.  If it's a birthday party, ask about what other ways they celebrated or plan to celebrate besides the party.  Don't ask their age (smile).  You may get some good conversation going from that.<br>  <br>  If you are meeting someone in a business related matter, ask them about their job or company, etc.

If I called you crazy, well I'd have to call myself madly insane, and I know I'm not and it kills me when people think that I am because they haven't experienced what I have. And Well, If they were your cats, they already know you. try talking to them, see if you can see them and communicate with them. I've had lots of cats before too, but my sisters were taking care of them for a while and they disappeared. Two of them (one that got hit by a car and the other had to be put down at the vets because of a problem he had) stayed around for a while as ghosts. They seemed happy though, They would come into my bed room at night and purr and curl up by my head and comfort me and such. I was little, I'm still young I'm 14. Both of them I think I got to heaven, they aren't around here anymore. Tell them to cross over and you'll see them later on and they'll always have a place in your heart.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	dude, seriously, that's probably just your local stray cats causin' a ruckus.
GoRFRY2naa	All those answers and not a decent atheistic note of intelligence among them.  I too am a former Christian and I read the bible from stem to stern, and the violence and horror perpetrated in that book are shocking.  This example is no worse that some others, and it is typical for their god to smite all kinds of people for all his stupid and arbitrary reasons.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is yes.  Plain and simple Y E S.<br>  <br>  Christians, is it not a shame that you have to apologize for your god's atrocious behavior?<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Lady Morgana|`|AA11389157	I love it when people try to pick apart the Bible to isolate things as an excuse for their hatred of God. Start from the beginning of the Bible and read through to the end (as you would do with any other book) and you will the story of a perfect God who is merciful and gracious enough to have tolerated man's stupidity so far. It never ceases to amaze me that no matter what God has done to demonstrate His love to us, puny and wicked hearted mankind continues to condemn Him and spit in His face.|`|4293cf50016bde6c1a79ccb90dbe6c96aa	God is a just God that doesn't tolerate continual sin.  Yes, He punishes.  He is a parent that loves His children.  Imagine if your parents never punished you, where would you be?  Running around doing your own thing like this screwed up society we live in.  kjv_gods couldn't be more correct.|`|d8zxbKduaa	I think John 3:16 is the best example of the loving God that Christians talk about.<br>  <br>  For God SO loved the world that He gave His only son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.|`|sd6vzmF1aa	Good question. The One who created all things, as the last verse declares, has complete authority over all creation. He formed a covenant with the best part of creation, mankind, who was made in His image. The first man, Adam, broke that covernant, so God made another convenant, in fact several, this time specific to the Hebrew people. He delivered them from Egypt and brought them into the Promised Land, but they continued to despise him and turn to wickedness.<br>  <br>  God had every right to just wipe them out at anytime, but instead disciplines them to bring them back. God is loving, sure, but let's not ever forget that God is Holy. Unholiness will bring his wrath. The Hebrew people were privililedged, but they rejected their priviledge, and ultimately rejected His son, and were cut out from the covenant, which was then placed upon the Gentile Christians who were "grafted in" and now are the "true Jews."<br>  <br>  Inspite of our continual sinning, God shows his love toward us in that while we were still sinners, God sent his son to die for us (See Romans 5:8).<br>  <br>  As for death by famine or sword or by any other means, please remember that everyone dies. The date of all of our deaths were known (and therefore determined) by God before he spoke the words of first creation. The fact that men die is not a reflections of God's lack of love -- the fact that we live at all, certainly is. He did not have to create anything. He does not have to redeem any part of creation, but chooses to redeem some.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Prime example of the strange relationship that believers have with God.  He is jealous, he is prone to anger, he is constantly testing man.  He punishes the good with the bad.  There must have been some children in Sodom and Gomorrah, his method is blow it all up I`ll sort them out later,hmmmm. He plays games with people he and the devil take turns with causing agony in a mans life.  His people turn from him and express themselves the way they wish, God hunts them down and withholds rain on their fields, what is that. He is directly responsible for getting a teen pregnant, and the only story she had for her father was God did it..He forced his son to die a horrible death because Eve failed the test? This loving God, didn't like the fact that, sons of God got jiggy with the daughters of man so Its, KILL THEM ALL..except Noah and family. There are 360 laws  given by God and most of them the punishment is ..stoning, hanging,cutting off limbs,and if your not Jewish you are punished twice as much.<br>  My point is he is not loving at all.  He mostly hates us, he is always sending some sort of terrible thing, why cant he just leave us alone.|`|g7RnYMoNaa	Yes it is, at same time it is a good example of people that hated justice and ignored the poor. I think if we could see all evil things these people did we would be horrified. God had done all he could to help them understand, but they refused to listen to his warnings. They deserved death, but God in his mercy had dealt mercifully and patiently with them in the hope to save them. At the same time as this is a good example of a loving God, it also tells us his mercy has a limit. He cannot accept evil forever, and we should be glad he can't.

Despite popular belief. God doesn't decide when your going to die he just knows.<br>  I think death is the only thing God can control. I think he can give you life-or at least a little more time if you want it bad enough, but death it self is a different thing. It isn't evil and it isn't good. it just is. Not knowing when your going to die should be better because then you can live every day like your going to day. Love everyone. Leave no regrets and don't hold petty grudges. You talking about suicide like it is something you control is wrong, because in reality you can't even control that. You can't control when you feel your going to feel suicidal I mean if you look at it phsycology wise, suicide is just a thought that occurs from and imbalance of a certain hormone in your brain. So either way you don't know.|`|6BJpdGKzaa	It says in the Bibile "thou shalt not kill", that includes yourself.<br>  God desides when we die because he made us. Because of him we are living so there for the only way we can die is because of him.  God desides when its your time to go because its when he is ready for you.<br>  Killing yourself or killing someone is like playing God.  God is the only one who deserves any kind of power like that.  Now it is sad that a 15 year old dies young without a long life but God was ready for them.<br>  He's not ready for you just because you decide its up to you to live. Remember he has a plan forever one. You cant just stop his plan and expect him to change it because of you.<br>  Good question by the way.

However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com

s26apn70aa	Im tired of the jewish's most infamous propaganda of Anti-Semitic this, Anti-Semitic that, bla bla bla. I've been hearing that word like 50-60 times, this week alone!<br>  <br>  How many times have we called ugly stubborn jews who put down Islam and Muslims, as Anti-Islam and Anti-Muslims. Jews have the bad habit of making non-jews sound and look bad when we only talk about slightest thing about their culture and religion.<br>  <br>  For example, if i say jews have big ugly hooked nose. The whole jewish community will bash me saying im anti-semitic, i have no moral values whatsoever. But on youtube, on here, and all over the internet, Islam and Muslims have been slayed and demoralized by jews and Christians but we muslims always let them go! Coz we muslims do not like to start any kinds of fights with anybody.|`|nS7koC7Oaa	How can we be anti-ourselves? We never been anti-Semism, esp the Arabs because we are 100% Semites but the jews are fools and use this "weapon" to push people in jails, but if you said we deny the holocaust then thats true,,<br>  <br>  and Anonymous, couldnt agree more!|`|4aveC2aaaa	>First off, I am a female, so you should fix your mistake and make it "(you can find HER here...)"<br>  <br>  >Second, yes it is a hadith. Here it is:<br>  <br>  Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and the Jews hide themselves behind stones and trees and the stones and the trees say, 'O Muslim! This Jew is behind me, so kill him!' With the exception of the thorn-tree which is one of the trees of the Jews."

And yes, I know that not all Muslims are Arabs, but most Arabs are Muslims.<br>  <br>  Besides, the "Christians" did more to persecute the Jews than the Muslims did.  Between the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Holocaust, just to name a few events, the Christians have done more to wipe out the Jews than the Muslims ever did.<br>  <br>  The same year that Columbus "discovered" America, the King and Queen of Spain forces out all Jews (and Muslims) from Spain.  Many were killed outright and many suffered as a result.  But many countries in Europe had done the exact same thing.  <br>  <br>  During the First Crusade, the Jews and Muslims fought together to defend Jerusalem against the invading Franks. They were unsuccessful though and on 15 July 1099 the crusaders entered the city. Again, they proceeded to massacre the remaining Jewish and Muslim civilians and pillaged or destroyed mosques and the city itself.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1099)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Je...</a><br>  <br>  In fact, the Muslims viewed the Jews as having a similar religious outlook and have treated them very well throughout history.  <br>  <br>  It's only been with the rise of Jewish Zionism and the radicalization of Judaism that conflict has arose between the Jews and the Muslims.
Ps9eOIchaa	Yes,i agree and i am bi-racial.I personally will not get married and have children with another bi-racial person because i do not want my children to be confused.Plus,after all of the things i put up with,i will not allow my children to go through it.I know we can't control ho we fall in love with,but i put up with so much,i don't want my kids going through|`|uQfJukisaa	Ok and that's important why?|`|DfDss68haa	There is a whole discusion about it at <a href="http://mulatto.org" rel="nofollow">http://mulatto.org</a><br>  <br>  I am biracial (mulatta whatever) and I would LOVE to date a biracial guy. I think that would be so cute to have second generation mulatto babies and I do feel there are things only another mulatto can understand. And it would be nice to "date inside my race" for once. Plus a lot of mulatto guys are just hot! Yummy. lol<br>  <br>  It's a combination of a lot of things I think. <br>  1. I personally haven't met many biracial guys. Maybe like 2 my WHOLE LIFE. We are still pretty spread out. We are just not in the same ratio as monoracials are to each other. If I waited around for a biracial guy I would be one single mulatto. <br>  <br>  2. Some biracials just aren't attracted to other mixed people. I don't understand it but they just have a preference for monoracials. Sometimes it goes deeper than preference. Like a mulatto guy who got made fun of all his life for being light skinned might actively seek out a dark skinned black woman so his children will be darker. Or a mulatta woman made fun of for being too dark will actively seek out a white guy so her children will not go through that. And when you add in those who are passing as white or the ones who are one dropping themselves as 100% black it gets complicated. There are some biracials with identity issues who believe they are white and those who have been told all their life they are black. So they will marry someone of the ethnicity they wish they were or think they are. <br>  <br>  3. There are people who want to create a mulatto race but as it stands the usual way that you get a mulatto is through monoracials having sex which means our parents are one race or the other and it has been proven that our opposite gender parent  and their appearance does influence who we date and find attractive. Little mulatto girls with black dads who grew up in predominantly Black neighborhoods are probably going to find Black men attractive. This can also explain the pattern you are seeing. Most interracial black/white relationships right now are WW/BM. So mulatta girls want a black man like their dad and mulatto guys want a white woman like their mom. It all fits. <br>  <br>  4. How society percieves us does influence who we date. In a relationship people believe the man is still supposed to be darker than the woman. That's what society tells us is appropriate. It's one reason BW/WM relationships are less common than the opposite. Also I have heard some biracials express the sentiment that they feel uncomfortable out in public when they are dating another biracial becuase they think people see them as brother and sister. This doesn't seem fair since many monoracials date people who look like their family without comment. But it affects us more becuase there are so few of us that dirty minded people would think it less likely we would find another biracial outside of our family. Sad but true.<br>  <br>  I don't let any of that stuff affect me. I date who I want. But while I would love to be in a mulatta/mulatto relationship I just don't see it happening.|`|5tY3eZcoaa	I personally don't feel most care about race to begin with, oppose to some people who are hooked on that purity ideology of one race, or people who don't like to see inter racial couples.  I've only dated one guy who is black/white, we were compatible in some ways but also different.  Many times, it seems we are attracted to different types of people that we can relate to on emotional levels rather than race. I notice many of the guys marry white women and many of the women marry black men. But again we all aren't the same.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	well celebs arent the best examples to go on.<br>  <br>  i have found some mixed kids to be cute. i knew 2 twin boys mixed the same as me, i crushed on them for a decade. never dated them though.<br>  <br>  i crush mostly on white. but its not a bad thing.<br>  <br>  sometimes its a feat alone just to get a mixed boy and mixed girl in the same room...but i think people just prefer to go for what they are attracted to.<br>  <br>  but yeah, i guess it is weird...you dont really see it....i havent seen it. but i know i crush on mixed guys.|`|BQXg09m9aa	Love is not found by race, but by person.|`|BWt4mj13aa	I only date white men.|`|2nRjy734aa	"We generally don't seem to date/marry our own."<br>  <br>  If you're half white and date a white person, and half black and date a black person, how are you not dating your own? Either way a biracial person goes (black or white) how are they dating outside their race?|`|0234a5919425f2503a2245af18fde971aa	The fact that biracial relationship are happening and in the open is historically an amazing development in recent decades. You love who you love, and race doesn't and shouldn't matter at all.|`|uAZlvHgiaa	There is not a big choice of bi racial people for them to chose from.

uuQrhnJ4aa	Honey, do yourself a favor and don't consult psychics. You're going down a road of never-ending questions & circles and psychics don't give out answers free of charge. If they do, (like on Y/A)..they'll likely hit you up to join their site for more readings. <br>  <br>  You've already asked a similar question, but you're not accepting their answers. This is suggestive that you will continue looking (& spending money) on readers until someone tells you something you want to hear. <br>  <br>  They work on the information you give them. Get it? You're giving them information. Eventually, you give them enough off-hand info that they develop a reading for you. <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor & see other ppl. You're 21 yrs old...a perfect time to be out enjoying yourself & having fun. Not pining over a guy or wishing for a future with him even though he's with someone else. If he wanted to be with you, he would-plain & simple. Try reading the book "He's just not that into you" (yes-it's a movie now, but the book gives good tips you could sure use).<br>  <br>  If you're determined to live in a fantasy w/this guy and spend spare time (which could be invested in furthering friendships or fun activities) consulting psychics...your life is going to be one big soap opera.

Every few days or so I'd have someone or the other at my door, telling me that kingdom was at hand and that I sould take advantage of it while I still could.  One day I got so tired of it that I inivited them in, and told them I would do as they asked except they would have to do something for me as well.  I gave them the "Mahabharata" a hindu religious epic with "Geeta" hymns in it.   I told them to read the book carefully and learn about my religion first and then I would think about maybe learning about her religion.  I have read the bible and now where does it say that I can't believe in god the way I want to.  They never bothered with me again or any other witnesses after that. <br>  <br>  You can change them, but you don't necessarily have to join them, just stick to your belifs (if you have them or not), cause it is not who you believe in it is the question, if you believe in Him/her, then you should pray to them in the manner that YOU find the most comfortable, cause in the end the relationship between you and god is a very personal matter, and you should decide (when you are old enough to know better)how you want to do this.  No one shoud be deciding it for you.|`|aZvWDxqvaa	I think there is too much socialistic influence in the world, what can we do about that?<br>  <br>  Religions do not scare me; if I can't deal with that small issue I need to become a hermit.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	I'm getting a taser gun for when people approach me to join their religion cult.<br>  <br>  There's nothing we can do.

But wanting to banish religion shows that you feel unsure about your own non-beliefs.  Do some thinking and studying; if you're honest, you'll discover that your own worldview owes very much to the religious influences you think you fear.  Don't be afraid of learning and understanding other opinions just because they're unpopular or ridiculed.  Knowledge typically enhances life.|`|XITPweLEaa	I don't know if there is much we can do.

nXBPXVnkaa	Start mapping your cycle on a calender (if you haven't already). Get enough rest, eat well, take your prenatal vitamins, etc. It can take a while to get pregnant - even if you don't have any other medical issues or problems. Relax and try not to focus too much on "have to make a baby" mode. It takes the fun out of the process and only creates unnecessary stress. If you continue to have problems after a year, you may want to consider going to see a RE (Reproductive Endocrinologist).<br>  <br>  This is the LGBT section, by the way.. :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11598520	I'm confused why you posted here. There is one test that you can use before you get your period. Remember, though, that the symptoms that you describe can often happen before you get your period, too. <br>  <br>  When we were trying to get pregnant, the doctor told us to try, as you have been every other day for a year if we were under 35 and 6 months if over 35. Also, try taking you basil body temperature every morning before you do anything, including going to the bathroom. You can use a digital thermometer, which makes it a lot easier. You can chart it later. You should experience a sharp spike in temperature when you are ready to ovulate. <br>  <br>  If after the time I've mentioned you are still not pregnant, you should go to see a fertility specialist. It might not even be a bad idea to do that now just to have tests done to make sure everything in each of you is working properly. He can guide you as to what to do next.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope your test is positive!|`|UCgNMbkDaa	why is this question on a LGBT board?<br>  <br>  you probably need to wait until 37 days +5 more to do a test.<br>  <br>  but they do have those early tests you can take.<br>  <br>  but i would call your OBGYN.

AA11755204	1. Our senses may not be perfect, but their input is still evidence that the universe exists.  If you're looking for absolute knowledge, we don't have any.  However, we have the evidence of our senses, and the consistency of our sensory input makes that evidence fairly reliable.<br>  <br>  2. Again, we have the evidence of other humans acting as we do.  We also have evidence of how brains work and the existence of brains in other humans.  Again, you're are confusing absolute knowledge for evidence.  Evidence doesn't have to be absolutely conclusive.  It just has to have direct implication, which MRI scans and the like do.<br>  <br>  3. This one doesn't even make sense.  You can write down what you remember then go back to the place you were remembering and confirm your memory.  It's not that difficult.<br>  <br>  As for God, there are a few problems that the questions you posted don't have.  First, there is a definition problem.  Both the term "god" and "spiritual" are vague in definition.  You can't claim something exists without defining what it is you are claiming to exist.  Secondly, there is no good evidence for any god existing.  The evidence of "miracles" and "holy" books is really weak.  The various abstract arguments for the existence of a god boil down to mere hand waving and wishful thinking.  The term "spiritual sense" is just too vague to even warrant an attempt at applying evidence.  The evidence for the universe, other's minds, and memories is much more concrete and consistent.|`|lXu5cJd1aa	Everything we take to be physically true must have physical evidence, which is taken from the 5 senses.

G569z5jlaa	I have no favorite conference but I have to say something about Joyce Meyer. Do you watch her show? She smirks and struts around on stage in her $1,000 dresses, gaudy earrings, and pukey open-toed designer shoes. She bellows at her audience like an Army Sargeant in that deep grating voice of hers, chastising, belittling, and browbeating her audience for doing the very same things that she herself does. And does so as she dramatically blinks her eyes for emphasis ...... blink ..... blink blink, blink .... smirk, blink. It's almost as if her audience members are there because they have a need to be abused ("yes, mother, beat me some more, I deserve it"). She chronically spends a lot of time ranting and raving about her background, and constantly whines about her abuse as a child, and makes big issues out of all of the problems she has or has ever had, while she occassionally blends in a few patrial scriptures to make her demonstrative arrogance and faux theology look like "religion".<br>  <br>  She often goes on and on about her timid house-husband Dave with his fleet of very expensive sports cars (that she bought for him). He should be known as "Mr. Joyce Meyer". But he's not stupid, at least he glommed onto her money and keeps a death grip on it too. I'll bet he's perfected all the ways of saying "Yes, dear". She's amazingly egotistical because she starts around half of her sentences with the word "I" as if everything is about her (and in her mind it no doubt is). She goes on and on about "me, me, me" when talking about herself, her life, and her past. Actually, by observational analysis, she does nothing more that use her audience as her own personal form of Gestalt therapy for herself. <br>  <br>  And she seems perpetually annoyed too, always about something, and throws it off onto her audience in the attempt to make them "co-annoyed". Then, in the last minute or so of her show, she's sitting down somewhere and facing the camera as she calmly tells everyone how God loves them, then offers something for sale because it will "help" them, such as one of her books. Then she flies home in her million dollar private jet to a multi-million dollar family compound that's so large, elaborate, and luxurious that it would be the envy of J. Paul Getty. All of THAT is Joyce Meyer's "ministry", courtesy of her supporters.|`|K24JFTOcaa	none, Jesus did that for me

And, Prophet Muhammad said that when you go to war do not harm the Non-conbantants, women, childron, inicints, or harm any plant or animal  life. Creation in the Qur'an How did God proceed to make the universe? Did He announce, "Let there be light"? Actually, no. There is no such verse in the Qur'an. What He did do will sound very familiar from a scientific point of view. He said the word "Be," and an object like a ball (or something equivalent to it) appeared, and then He split it into pieces. The materials from this initial explosion were the building blocks for all things in the universe. The force of that blast continues to expand and spread this matter in all directions even to this day. The Qur'an is very clear when it says, "Don't the people who hide the truth see that space and the earth were all joined together in one unit of creation and then We split them apart?" (Qur'an 21:30) Does this statement ring a bell? Scientists would call this description amazingly close to the modern concept of the Big Bang. After this great explosion of matter, the Qur'an mentions that the heavens were filled with a kind of smoke. The formation of planets and stars soon followed, and the fact that they have regular orbits is stated in the Qur'an, as well: "By the rotation of the stars and the orbit and setting of the planets, by the night as it falls and the morning as it passes, certainly, this is the speech of an honored Messenger." (Qur'an 81:25) Interestingly enough, the Qur'an also describes the movement of bodies in space by using the Arabic word for swim. Planets and stars are swimming in their courses. As we know today, space is not empty and the objects within it move at a measurable pace not unlike a person gliding under water. "We built the universe with [creative] power and We are certainly expanding it. We spread the Earth out wide and how excellent We ordered it! And We created every [living] thing in pairs so you could get a reminder.” (Qur’an 51:47–49) Mathematical Miracle of the Quran. Simple facts. Like the Quran itself, the Quran's mathematical Miracle ranges from the very simple , to the very complex. The following facts do not require any tools to be verified, but please remember they all refer to the original Arabic text: 1- The first verse 1:1 known as "Basmalla" consists of 19 letters. 2-This verse was revealed to Muhammed after 74:30, which states "Over it is 19". not a coincidence. 3-The Quran consists of 114 suras, which is 19X6. 4-The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or 19X334 (6234 numbered verses and 112 unnumbered verses (Basmalla). 6234+112=6346. notice also that 6+3+4+6= 19 5-The Basmalla occurs in the Quran 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) and 114 = 19 X 6 6-From the missing Basmalla of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalla of Sura 27, there are precisely 19 Suras. 7-It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 9+10+11+12..... . +26+27) is 342, or 19X 18 8-This total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmallas of sura 27. and 342 = 19X18 9-The famous first revelation (96:1-5) consists of 19 words. 10-This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters, & 76=19X4 11-Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of 19 verses. 12-This first Chronological sura is placed atop the last 19 suras. 13-Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters and 304 = 19X16 14-The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of 19 words. 15-14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of "Quranic Initials" (Such as A.L.M., of 2:1) and prefix 29 suras.These numbers add up to 14+14+29=57 19 X 3 16-The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic initials occur is 2+3+7....+50+68=822, and 822 +14 (14 sets of initials)=836 =19X44 17-Between the first intialed Sura (Sura 2) and the last intialed Sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras , 38=19X2 18-Between the first and last initialed sura there are 19 sets of alternating "initialed" and "uninitialed" Suras, 19-The Quran mention 30 different whole numbers throughout, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,19,20,30,40,5... 3000,5000,50,000, & 100,000. The sum of these numbers is 162146 = 19X8534 The following 2 facts may need some help with a calculator. 20- The word God (ALLAH) occurs throughout the Quran in its 114 Suras 2698 times and 2698= 19X142. 21-The number of verses where the word God occurs add up to 118123 also a multiple of 19, = 19X6217|`|ouXrNitMaa	Personally, I've found the vast majority of Muslims are indeed VERY good people. Their religion is very strict, and forbids many things which are directly responsible for most common ills of today's society.<br>  <br>  The problem I have with Islam is that it uses some very intellectually dishonest tactics to propagate itself. So many Muslims resort to crafting very convincing hoaxes to stimulate interest in Islam, and they are taught that they will get special rewards for "sharing" Islam with others. It's a matter of the ends justifying the means.<br>  <br>  And the problem with Islam itself is that it is regulated by a handful of people who have added to it and distorted it beyond any hope of repair. This is exactly what Mohammad was trying to avoid. He saw the variance and contradictions between the Christian sects and went to great lengths to make sure his own religion contained no such contradictions. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, he drew upon the previous works of others. Namely, cherry-picked parts from the Bible, and Greek science. His biggest blunder was to plagiarize Greek science in an attempt to seem as "all-knowing" as the deity whom he claimed to speak for. The errors are clear, and there are many of them. Many scientific misconceptions of the ancient Greeks can be found in the Qur'an.<br>  <br>  Please do research Islam, but make SURE you check and double check any and all extraordinary claims made my Muslims who insist Islam could not possibly be from the mind of a man. If a religion is indeed true, it doesn't need lies to support it. Keep an open mind, but be skeptical as well.<br>  <br>  Edit: BUGBOY is demonstrating perfectly what I mentioned earlier. People like him depend on the innocent ignorance of others to lull them into a false sense of being informed.
KBBonf97aa	Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to "dabble" in same-sex relationships, so there's not a negative stigma.  Straight girls are basically given license to satisfy their curiosity and test their boundaries without any negative repercussions, so there's no risk that they'll be labeled gay or otherwise stigmatized.  Most girls who identify as bisexual are actually straight and wouldn't even think about messing around with other girls if there were a risk they'd be labeled lesbian.  Some are "dabbling" because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions during adolescence are normal, but temporary.  But because it's considered hip to "play lesbian" for a while, girls don't have to worry about negative reactions.<br>  <br>  It's much more dangerous for teenage boys to openly question their sexuality, since there's still a negative stigma associated with male homosexuality.  Even if a boy knows he's gay, he'll probably find it safer to date girls until he's finished with school.  A lot of boys do question their sexuality, but they have to be discrete about it if they don't want to be humiliated by guys who feel threatened by gays.  Most boys who identify as bisexual eventually come out as gay, but they're less apt to become targets of violence or other abuse from peers if they keep the option of dating girls on the table through school.  When they're older and out in the real world, it's easier for them to acknowledge their true orientation.  The world is a much more welcoming place than your average high school.|`|ozmqdlEbaa	i believe its a little of both.|`|NwXnzARwaa	Girls tend to not define themselves with labels, but how they perceive themselves and who they think they are. <br>  <br>  Boys tend to define themselves with labels, and how they are perceived by others and what other people think they are.<br>  <br>  Girls may be more open to question who they are because that perception is based on their own viewpoint without relying on the perceptions of others, while boys will rely on the viewpoints and perceptions of others and attempt to be what others perceive them as.|`|EG1cAHh0aa	I think that it's the same except that society allows girls to be open about their sexuality and society will accept them, were as bi guys like me get thrown weird glances for even thinking about other guys.|`|NZh3gPluaa	I think its because girls would want to at least try things with girls, I don't see how anybody could be attracted to a guy, so that would also be why guys don't want to try that.
AA11690436	It does contain some impressive poetry.  But more than that, it forms one of the pillars of the body of Western Culture's literature.  To not read the bible is to handicap one's understanding of the great works, from Dante and Cervantes through Shakespeare.  It provides an historical record, not necessarily of factual events, but of how people thought and felt over a period of at least half a thousand years.  And there is, occasionally, a dollop of real wisdom to be gleaned (what is harmful to oneself do not do to others).<br>  <br>  If you don't want to read the whole thing, I suggest three books, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Solomon, and Job.

We're talking about an intangible feeling, a lot like Love, and Happiness being intangibles. <br>  <br>  The best example to this I can give to what I feel comes from Luke 24: 32<br>  <br>  32: And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<br>  <br>  I have felt such in my life in the LDS church. I know that it comes from God and nowhere else. <br>  <br>  And if you think I don't know what something from Satan is like, I can tell you, I've felt his influence in my life as well. It's a completely different feeling altogether. <br>  <br>   Most LDS members are very apt in discerning good from evil, whether they resist it is another matter.<br>  <br>  Edit: History, spare me your diatribe. The feeling also comes from studying and knowing that the things we are studying come from correct gospel princpals and recognizing it, hence comes the "did not our hearts burn within us" <br>  <br>  Pretty, I've been in similar circumstances. There isn't just one guy "that is the one" On the contary there are several potential eternal companions out there, so your feeling that every person out there was the right eternal companion could very well be true.

So when a human law ... is contrary to God's law, this human law has no value," Cardoso had said.<br>  <br>  He also said the accused stepfather would not be expelled from the church. Although the man allegedly committed "a heinous crime ... the abortion - the elimination of an innocent life - was more serious".<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't really understand HOW it can be stated that the abortion was 'more serious' than what the stepfather did. He subjected this poor child to years of abuse.<br>  <br>  Nor do I think any child of that age should be condemned for having an abortion; and I take my hat off to those who helped her. I know many or most of them were Catholics and I'm sure it wasn't totally comfortable for them. But they put common sense and morality ahead of dogma - and in return were ex communicated.<br>  <br>  I'm not a Catholic, so my views are those of an outsider. It's a very, very sad and troubling story, in my humble opinion.|`|yrJQHOOeaa	My opinion is simply this... Those who were excommunicated are indeed better for their excommunication.

Nine year old little girls are not developed sufficiently to carry A baby to term, let alone two. This is the reason for the abortion, not because she was raped by her vile step father.

They're all almighty, but not almighty enough to show up.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	The first two names have nothing to do with actual names used in Judaism. They are transliterations other theological beliefs use in  replacement of the Tetragrammaton (YHVH).<br>  <br>  There is no known pronunciation for the Tetragrammaton, as it was lost ages ago. Without the vowels in place, it is impossible to know the exact pronunciation (think of saying words in English without the a-e-i-o-u vowels).<br>  <br>  When reciting a complete Scriptural or liturgical verse, the four-letter Tetragrammaton, is pronounced Ado(k)ai.  Otherwise it is referred to as Hashem, which literally translates to "the Name" or "Havayah" (a permutation of the letters of the Tetragrammaton).<br>  <br>  *Note: Please replace (k) with n.<br>  <br>  In Jewish thought, a name is not merely an arbitrary designation, a random combination of sounds. The name conveys the nature and essence of the thing named. It represents the history and reputation of the being named.<br>  <br>  This is not as strange or unfamiliar a concept as it may seem at first glance. In English, we often refer to a person's reputation as his "good name". When a company is sold, one thing that may be sold is the company's "good will" that is, the right to use the company's name.  The Hebrew concept of a name is very similar to these ideas.<br>  <br>  Because a name represents the reputation of the thing named, a name should be treated with the same respect as the thing's reputation. For this reason, God's Names, in all of their forms, are treated with enormous respect and reverence in Judaism.<br>  <br>  The Hebrew word Elo(k)im most often refers to G-d, but it is actually a descriptive word meaning "one of power" or "force". Thus, it can also mean an angel (Genesis 32:29) or a powerful leader (Exodus 7:1).<br>  <br>  The different names used throughout the Tanach, describe different attributes of God. There are both feminine and masculine terms, and words for 'my God' and 'our God'.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	"Elohim" is a title meaning "god." Even in Greek it is usually translated with the definite article and no capitalization: "the god." Yahweh was the name of the God of Israel, supposedly given to Moses on Mount Sinai. <br>  <br>  The Jews did not want to take the name of God in vain, so they refused to pronounce "Yahweh" out loud. When they saw the word Yahweh in the Hebrew, they pronounced it "Adonai" (which means "Lord"). When they started adding vowels, they used the vowels from the word "Adonai" (a-o-a) with the consonants from the word Yahweh (Y-W-H, or, in English, J-V-H). The result was the word "Yahowah" or "Jehovah" in English transliterations.<br>  <br>  Pre-Victorian scholars were not aware of the Jewish scribal convention, so they assumed that "Yahweh" was supposed to be pronounced "Jehovah."|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Yahweh and Jehovah are two failed attempts to speak the unspeakable name of God, which is made of four Hebrew consonants. the proper vowels are no longer known. Elohim is a plural Hebrew word that is loosely translated as 'God' in the English versions of the Bible.|`|b6c7fc9770ac81ddeac8b21a4fa2346aaa	"YaHWeH" and "JeHoVaH" are just different English forms of Gd's name in Hebrew "YHVH". Going from Hebrew to Greek to Latin to English, the letters "Y/J/I" and "V/U/W" become interchangable.<br>  Due to the unbiblical tradition that believers are forbidden to say God's name, a tradition created by rabbis in the past two millenium, conflict has arisen over the correct way to pronounce it. But I believe this is easily discovered through the Hebrew name YHshVH (Yehoshuah/ "YHVH is Salvation"). In English this is "Jesus". It comes closest to the "JeHoVaH" pronunciation. <br>  <br>  "Elohim" is the Hebrew plural form of "El" meaning "God" and is used several times in the Creation narative of Genesis - especially, "And God [Elohim] said, Let US make man in OUR image, after OUR likeness."<br>  <br>  -Rev. Jim Cunningham<br>  King James Bible Ministries|`|V8TFzhYZaa	Yahweh and Jehovah are both phonetic approximations of the tetragrammaton "YVWH," while Elohim is a plural title which translates as "the company of creators."|`|FK9Z75Staa	There isn't any.

Try respectfully explaining that to your family, while still sticking up for yourself. You can also talk to a trusted adult, teacher, or guidance counselor at school and just explain the situation and ask for some advice. I think you will appreciate throughout your life that you do know these languages. But for now, there's only so much you can take. So while being respectful of your family's diverse background, language, and culture, explain to them that you cannot do everything---and that while you are proud of your heritage, you need to find your own place, which may be in Spain, Portugal, Malaysia, Vietnam, here in America, or even somewhere else.

c8AGj83Iaa	I would argue simply that there is no such thing as the supernatural. That is not to say that 'miracles' and magick don't exist, but rather they exist within the realms of the natural order of the world. To say something is supernatural is to imply it being outside of nature.This is not the case. These thing are natural. They may be a litle rarer and harder to explain, but they are natural. We just don't have a system that is accurate enough to explain these things in the same way we explain gravity etc. I do beleive the world is controlled by a set of laws and that each thing follows these laws after their own nature.

mVBaDtQwaa	I think you answered your own question when you said it's illogical.  Dividing people up by which race they are and by how much is inaccurate and not particularly useful. <br>  <br>  I'm biracial myself and I have always found it interesting to see how different people react to me. Black Americans just think I'm light-skinned, blacks in Canada where I live know I'm "mixed" and treat me accordingly, many whites just think I'm black, and when I'm in Europe they know I'm biracial right away.  <br>  <br>  Different reactions, same person.  <br>  <br>  With regard to the one drop rule, everyone does it not just whites.  Remember how Oprah was getting on Tiger Woods' case, telling him he IS black no matter what racial mix he is? <br>  <br>  I think race itself is a system of categorization that doesn't really exist in science.  It's based completely on discrimination and I look forward to the day when we can leave these broad useless terms behind.|`|x9p3bXpCaa	People don't call mixed race people by a certain lable to be mean or piss them off. it's just that like when you look at someone you can usually tell if they are a certain race or are atleast partly a certain race so they just make generalizations based on what they see. nobody is going to look at mixed people like president obama or halle berry and go "oh i better do a DNA test to make sure that they are really black."<br>  and it's not just white people who do that btw<br>  there isn't really a way to stop it. just don't take it so personally when someone accidentally calls you a race you're not or you're only partly. i doubt they are doing it on purpose and if they are then **** them :/|`|0rDDPTi5aa	So how should people classify themselves?  While I agree that modern day racial classifications are racist and outdated, what other way should we do it?<br>  <br>  Its true that all people, especially Americans, are mixed.  As a black American, I know that in my family we have native American, white, and even Chinese.  However, when its time to fill out applications, I am not going to check all these things, I will go with what is the majority race I am, which is black or African American.  I think most people would do the same.<br>  <br>  Edit  Yes, I agree that biracial people have their own category, because they have two parents of a different race.  Unfortunately the world we live in has not caught up with the technology.  People still judge by appearances.  <br>  <br>  I saw Halle Berry in an interview say that her white mother told her she was black, because that is what she looks like, and that is what people will judge her as.  I just read in the new Essence magazine, that she still views herself as black because that is what she sees in the mirror: a black woman.  <br>  <br>  However, she says that she will teach her daughter about ALL her racial heritage.  So, I think that with the next generation, this thinking will change.  Give it time!!<br>  <br>  Edit   I guess I don't view myself that way because its far back, like great great grandparents.  Plus, I always thought that the label "black" included mixtures.  In some places like Brazil, most black Americans would be called "pardo" or brown, because of how mixed we are.   I guess each country has a way of identifying how they view themselves.|`|DhgU7x0Daa	Interesting question! I've found a lot of African-Americans to claim people of any black heritage or appearance as their own. In fact, I see black magazines all that time (such as "black hair" magazine) that often feature biracial (half white) people. I'm sure they didn't ask those biracial people how they identify. African History books reflect the same thing (a lot of biracial Americans' achievements credited to only one race). Like you said, I think it is emotional rather than technical thinking, not that that's always wrong. And it's true... if a mixed race person feels compelled to accept one race's label and reject the other, society needs to change so they can be all of themselves.<br>  <br>  You make good points. Have a star.

In Latin languages, you can usually do without the pronoun, because it is implied in the verbal form. So, "Amo la mia vita" sounds more natural, more colloquial, and that's how Italian people really talk. "Io amo la mia vita" sounds more like a textbook sentence.<br>  (Source: I'm Portuguese and I speak Italian)|`|bUuqOLBNaa	I love you: Io amo la mia vita<br>  <br>  Classification<br>  Italian is a member of the Italo-Dalmatian group of languages, which is part of the Italo-Western grouping of the Romance languages, which are a subgroup of the Italic branch of Indo-European.<br>  History<br>  The origins of italian language are very complex and mostly formalized by Dante Alighieri mixing south italian dialects, especially from Sicilian, with his native Tuscan ("supposed" to be derived from Etruscan and Oscan). Those older italian dialects were hardly influenced by the Occitan bring by the Bard escaping from France centuries before under the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Of the major Romance languages, which were derived from Latin language, Italian is the closest to Latin, although there are other langauges spoken in Italy which are even closer to Latin, for example Sardo logudorese language.<br>  Italians say that the best spoken Italian is lingua toscana in bocca romana - 'the Tuscan tongue, in a Roman mouth.' The formative influence on establishing the Tuscan as the elite speech is generally agreed to have been Dante's Commedia, to which Boccaccio affixed the title Divina in the 14th century.<br>  The economic power that Tuscany had at the time, specially considering Pisa's influence, gave its dialect weight, though Venetian remained widespread in the markets and streets of the Terra Firma. Also, the increasing cultural relevance of Florence in the period of Umanesimo (before Rinascimento) made its vulgare become a standard in art, quickly imported to Rome.<br>  Geographic distribution<br>  Italian is the official language of Italy, San Marino and an official language in the Ticino and Grigioni cantons or regions of Switzerland. It is also the second official language in Vatican City and in some areas of Istria in Slovenia and Croatia with an Italian minority. It is widely used by immigrant groups in Luxembourg, the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Australia, and is also spoken in neighbouring Malta and Albania. It is spoken, to a much lesser extent, in parts of Africa formerly under Italian rule such as Somalia, Libya and Eritrea.<br>  Official status<br>  Italian is an official language of Italy, San Marino, Switzerland, Slovenia and Vatican City.<br>  Dialects<br>  The dialects of Italian identified by the Ethnologue are Tuscan, Abruzzese, Pugliese (Apulian), Umbrian, Laziale, Central Marchigiano, Cicolano-Reatino-Aquilano, and Molisan. Other dialects are Milanese, Brescian, Bergamasc, Venetian, Modenese, Bolognese, Sicilian, Sardian, and so on, essentially one per city. Many of the so-called dialects of Italian spoken around the country are different enough from standard Italian to be considered separate languages by most linguists.<br>  Grammar<br>  Pronouns:<br>  Personal pronouns in the subject of a sentence are usually unnecessary in Italian, because the verb ending provides information about the subject (apart some exceptions), and hence the pronouns are used only to emphasize the subject.<br>  Singular Plural:<br>  ?  1st Person io - I noi - we <br>  ?  2nd Person tu - you (one person, familiar) <br>  ?  voi - you (plural, familiar) <br>  ?  3rd Person lei - she <br>  ?  Lei - you (one person, polite) <br>  ?  lui - he <br>  ?  loro - they <br>  ?  Loro - you (plural, polite) <br>  Lei and Loro (sometimes written with a capitalized L) have special meaning in addition to their meanings as "she" and "they". Lei is the polite form of tu (which is only used for individuals one is familiar with, family members, for children, or for praying to a god), and similarly, Loro is the polite form of voi (but voi or Voi too is a polite form).<br>  Verbs<br>  Italian verb infinitives have one of three endings, either -are, -ere, or -ire. Most Italian verbs are regular.<br>  Questions are formed by a rising intonation at the end of the sentence, as in most European languages (see examples below).<br>  Present Indicative Regular Conjugation Patterns<br>  This is the basic conjugation pattern used to indicate that something is occurring now.<br>  -are Singular Plural<br>  1st Person -o -iamo <br>  2nd Person -i -ate<br>  3rd Person -a -ano<br>  Example: mangiare, "to eat".<br>  Io mangio. (or just Mangio.) I eat. <br>  Antonio mangia. Antonio eats.<br>  Antonio mangia? Does Antonio eat? <br>  Mangia Antonio? Does Antonio eat? <br>  guardare, "to watch"<br>  Noi guardiamo la televisione. (or just Guardiamo la televisione.) We watch television. <br>  -ere Singular Plural <br>  1st Person -o -iamo <br>  2nd Person -i -ete<br>  3rd Person -e -ono<br>  Example: leggere, "to read"<br>  Leggono i libri. They read books.<br>  Leggo il giornale. I read the newspaper.<br>  Some regular -ire verbs conjugate normally, and some conjugate according to the -isco pattern. There is no way to tell other than to memorize which are which <br>  -ire (normal form) Singular Plural<br>  1st Person -o -iamo <br>  2nd Person -i -ite<br>  3rd Person -e -ono<br>  Example: partire, "to leave"<br>  Partite. You leave. (plural; used if talking to two or more persons one is familiar with.)<br>  Parti. You leave. (singular; used if talking to only one person one is familiar with.)

Why suffer with a hangover the next day or be blitzed the whole time and not get to enjoy the beaches, scenery, etc.<br>  Look around for eateries, your hotel may be more expensive than local places and not very good potions either.<br>  For fun places to be, ask other tourists that have been there before and have experienced the hot spots and the jip joints. Just ask those around and you'll find some that have been there more than once.<br>  No offense to Americans or Germans, but my kin found that they were mistaken for either, because of their skin and hair colour and were treated poorly until they started wearing Maple Leafs.<br>  Other than the beach with others your age, try sight seeing.

My mother (who was raised Catholic) never told me that Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, etc. were real.

She taught me to be honest by showing me the example of honesty.  <br>  <br>  She explained to me that Santa Claus was a symbol of the importance of being a giving, generous person.  Kind of like how the dove is considered a symbol of peace.  As for the Easter Bunny, well, how do you explain the Easter Bunny?  I still don't understand what the point of the Easter Bunny is.  That one definitely confuses me.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, what's wrong with kids knowing that their parents are giving them gifts or money and not some mythical character?

One is the Book of the Universe, a jot of whose testimony we have heard from the thirteen Flashes together with the Thirteenth Word of the Risale-i Nur. Another is the Seal of the Prophets (Upon whom be blessings and peace), the supreme sign of the Book of the Universe. Now, we must become acquainted with the Seal of the Prophets {Upon whom be blessings and peace), who is the second and Articulate Proof, and must listen to him. <br>  <br>  Indeed, look at the collective personality of this proof: the face of the earth has become his mosque, Mecca, his mihrab, and Medina, his pulpit. Our Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him}, this clear proof, is leader to all the believers, preacher to all mankind, the chief of all the prophets, lord of all the saints, the leader of a circle for the remembrance of God comprising all the prophets and saints. He is a luminous tree whose living roots are all the prophets, and fresh fruits are all the saints; whose claims all the prophets relying on their miracles and all the saints relying on their wonderworking confirm and corroborate. For he declares and claims: There is no god but God! And all on left and right, that is, those luminous reciters of God's Names lined up in the past and the future, repeat the same words, and through their consensus in effect declare: "You speak the truth and what you say is right!"

Many people say - " If god exists , why doesn’t he show himself  or why doesn’t he  tell me something " . Its not god's fault YOU CANT hear him ,you don’t even WANT to hear him ( maybe only of curiosity ),  you have to make progress in spiritual way... God cannot make you hear him , you have to want to know him from your soul and heart  , even this poem tells you it -" You run to me I will run to you" , read between the lines , if you believe in science so much then how come you have no logic people ???If you say with sarcasm -" If god can do everything , how come he doesn’t show up or stop innocent people from being killed ?" well can you do everything??? Who do you know  that can do  everything ?? For sure -NOT YOU (disbelievers) .People die for a purpose , do you know what reincarnation is ?? Take small steps , actually take huge steps as there is no time , there is always time it depends on how you use it . Grow spiritually very quick there is NO time , deadline - 2012 ... I recommend Rei Ki ...<br>  <br>  Remember there is only one god, one big  light in the universe, and you are a part of it  . Religion is a human made bull****, but even in a bible you can find some useful stuff - READ BETWEEN THE LINES ! Find god IN YOU. Live with your heart , not from your greedy and filthy brain , use it when you need it , don’t let it control you , remember you are the one in control ...<br>  <br>  Good luck dude . <br>  <br>  Peace out .

Another problem I had, I couldn't make up my mind which field to go into if aforesaid costs and health hadn't been an issue.

Does a person have a soul if they have the ability to reason? To feel and respond to others?<br>  <br>  To me, a soul is based on genetics. Humans are set apart from animals because we have to ability to reason. Our brains and bodies are built in a unique way different from wild animals and that is what allows us to think. <br>  <br>  Our bodies are weak compared to animals, but our brains are much stronger. When we think, we explore everything. We question everything. Why are we here? Who created us? Thus, religion came to fruit from our thoughts. What is God? Why should we believe in something/someone we can't see, hear, feel? Thus, atheism also came to fruit.<br>  <br>  Our souls came from our thoughts. We think about feelings, love, and peace. The soul is defined as the principle of life, feeling, thought, and action in humans. Think about it; if one were to injure one's brain heavily enough, one would lose the ability to think. We would become vegetables. Lights are on, but no one's home. In that state, we would only be able to rely on pure instinct. Then, we'd become just like animals. <br>  <br>  There's your answer. Whether or not you choose to believe in it is your own choice.|`|yrJQHOOeaa	My belief is that a spirit, soul, and consciousness are one and the same. To ask where our souls came from is like asking where your god came from. Just as I cannot prove the existence of my consciousness; You cannot prove the existence of your god. Just because YOU do not believe in MY beliefs doesn't make them any less true to me. Just because I do not believe in YOUR god doesn't make your god any less true to you. My beliefs live because they are manifested through my mind. Your god exists to you because he is manifested through your mind. These are just my beliefs, they are not right or wrong... they just ARE.|`|qFxoeAaQaa	Souls are something that the human race has developed to help comfort our fears toward death.

When I was in highschool, i was a very bad cutter due to a horrible life situation in general. It is not good at all. These kind of things get you admitted to the psychiatric unit pretty quickly if people see it. I still have ugly scars on my arms from this, so please, if u are cutting, I would definately stop now while u are ahead, as this typically comes across as a suicide attemp to most depending on where you do it. Cutting is not a fashion trend, it is a sign of mental illness!!
jM7CyxQzaa	To 'purify their souls' <br>  <br>  This despicable practice was rife when the Church had so much power and people lived in fear of their 'souls'. Pretty much they were scared into going to church, no such thing as 'free will' <br>  <br>  At this time there were still feudal systems in place, and if the Lord of the Manor said 'you shall be Christian because I am Christian' there was no choice for the people. If they disagreed they would lose their homes and their livilihood - and often their lives. That was how life was at that time.<br>  <br>  The Church was trying to convert everyone via fear rather than education - at this time the Church and the Law pretty much the same thing, and both were about control of the people. Very few people could read or write and so learning was by verbal teaching, and the people doing the teaching were Christian so therefore the teachings were christian.<br>  <br>  Now because of the Church having so much power, and people being scared to 'go against the grain' in case their mortal Soul was put in danger (a threat that was used by those 'in control' to scare the populance into behaving) people would often bring 'non believers' to the notice of those in authority, for several reasons;-<br>  <br>  Firstly if anyone in the area was accused of being a 'witch' then by association their family, and more importantly here their friends and neighbours would also come under suspicion. So people learned to point the finger and yell witch rather than stand up for the accused.<br>  <br>  Some people felt they could gain 'favour' and also assure their souls a place in heaven by bringing 'unbelievers' to the attention of the authorities - their reward was their place in heaven. Hence they would accuse without any shred of proof.<br>  <br>  Those people who did things 'differently' in any way came under suspicion as the poorly educated were scared of anything they did not understand - and if they were scared they pointed the finger and yelled 'witch' in the same way that kids will yell at a child who is different - has glasses, red hair etc. Trouble was back then it could get the victim killed.<br>  <br>  The last reason is pure spite, if someone had a grievance or cause to want revenge for some perceived wrong then to accuse someone of being a witch brought a world of trouble to them and so it was a great way of getting their own back (lovely world ain't it?)<br>  <br>  The torturing was to get a 'confession' from the victim, and also to get them to name others who were in league with them. Torturing took the form of burnings, starvation, the rack etc etc - all the normal medieval ways of extracting info from someone. <br>  <br>  The belief for the actual killing was also twofold, if the witch was unharmed by the flames or the water (if they were being ducked in the river) then they were a witch and that was the proof, and so the pain caused by the method was thought to 'purify their soul' and sorta scare the 'evil' from them, so they could be 'saved' by the people doing the killing. These killers would then be assured of a place in heaven because they'd been responsible for either saving a soul or killing a witch.<br>  <br>  If however they burned to death or drowned then they were considered innocent and their souls were happily sent to heaven which was considered a reward for BEING innocent. You could not come out of this alive either way.<br>  <br>  For more information and an understanding of this time read The Triumph of the Moon by Ronald Hutton.|`|wsc96EDmaa	because people thought that they were in league with the devil|`|mqV9TOv0aa	To understand this you would have to look at the history of the Inquisition! (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition</a><br>  Because of its objective — combating heresy — the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptised members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could (AND DID WITH A VENGEANCE) still try non-Christians for blasphemy.

Z03zgM0maa	do you like law? do you see yourself being a lawyer, organizing evidence and making arguments? you're right, the money is important, but in the end you want to do what you believe you were born to do. any career you see as enjoyable, will not feel like a job, but a hobby that you're getting paid to do. just follow your instincts. chasing dreams are scary, but that's part of the thrill. there are too many adults i talk to and hear "i wish i done this, i wish i done that...what would've happened?"|`|7Ohs5ABCaa	All I can say is enjoy your youth because it goes away quickly and you only have it once.|`|QrJBg2Draa	to go into a career you kind of have to like it if you love music try and pursue it and if that doesnt work pursue writing/journalism if your going to go to law school just for the money later down the road your going to regret it because your not going to like your job as a lawyer or attorney so take that into consideration also|`|V8dXNAGeaa	You should become a journalist.  If you love writing, that's a good way to make money and still have fun doing it.  As for the music, it's fine to love it--MANY people do!

You'll still be able to listen to CDs and iTunes and the radio and everything whenever you want and you'll still be able to make a comfortable living.<br>  Hope this helps!  Good luck with your choice--it's a big one.

Civilization, however, has drawn women out of their homes, rent their veils, and corrupted mankind. For family life continues through the mutual love and respect of man and wife.

oML597wvaa	Well I am not wiccan but I can tell you as a person who has similar experiences that you most likely have a connection with the spiritual world. In order to be a vamp you would have to come into actual contact with the person, since you don't have to actual come into contact in order to read their energy I would say you are not a blood idk. However if you are connected to the spiritual world that would very much explain why it is you are under the impression you can controll the waves and can altar peoples luck. What I think you are experiencing with the waves is linked with the fact that supernaturals and those in touch with supernaturals are able to draw a tremendous amount of energy from sources of water, I think you may be feeling that draw of energy and confuseing it with a nonexisting "power." Now as far as deep conversation and eye contact, the human phsici opens up energy flow during deep conversation allowing you to read more of their energy leaving them feeling drained and you should feel pumped. If you want to test my idea's simply do this; find a friend who is shy and generally not talkative or confrontational, ask that person to place thier hands without touching about 4 inches from yours then ask them to close their eyes and tense then relax every muscle in their body. As they are doing this the space between your hands should get warm or even hot. Don't report your findings aloud, write it down. Then do the same experiment with a friend that is very confrontational, loud, and sometimes abnoxiouse, if the space gets warm this time your ability is true. If you have a connection to the spirit world then you must be very cautous to not become a target for evil spirits or deamons, just because you don't believe in them doesn't mean they don't believe in you. You may experience some paranoya and have some very bad and vivd dreams. The best thing you can do is write things down and throw them away this will help you to learn how to detach yourself from negative energies and avoid becomeing a target, if you feel confused you are doing the best thing by looking for answers. The last thing I would suggest is to research your religion, find out historically where it came from and its different practices so you can avoid practices that may open doors for negative energy. I hope you figure it out, feel free to contact me if you have any other questions. I think you have been granted an amazing and frightening gift that most wiccans are not given, you will be able to contoll it better in time. By the way I am 26 and I started before 15 haveing what I now call "goodbye dreams" from passed relatives and pets, I now am able to achieve a minimal amount of communication with passed people. Because it still frightens me some, when I see them or sense a strong presence I let them know I am aware of them and that I don't wish to harm, see, or communicate with them if it is not necessary. I have learned to be able to not drain people of their energy while we are talking, unfortunately I have yet to master that talent. Good Luck!|`|VnX9UR1Faa	Well there have been cases known to people and there was even a documentary about real life vampires who could receive energy from others and that's what they would do instead of taking blood. So i'm pretty sure you may have some vampire traits or just an extra sense. People around the world have been known to receive energy from others and everyone is kinda like that. That's why people get happy when others are happy you might just have a more heightened sense of it but instead of feeling you get your own form of energy. Hope It kinda helped if not sowwy :D|`|CSysSbnlaa	Those are traits. No joke. I'm a Vamp, obviously I know the signs. But, Vamps can will stuff to wake and your element is something everyone has.

pMFLqU0Yaa	Nope, not originally German. 'Tis from Hebrew.<br>  <br>  JANDERA was originally derived from the Hebrew given name YOCJANAN (Jehovah has favoured me with a son), and the name was adopted into the Latin (via Greek) as JOHANNES. This name has enjoyed enormous popularity in Europe, being given in honour of St. John the Baptist, precurser of Christ and of St. John the Evangelist, author of the fourth gospel, as well as others of the nearly one thousand saints of the name. There are numerous variant spellings of the surname, and it is known to every country in the world in different forms. There have been many notables of the name including twenty-one popes and two anti-popes XVI (997-8) and XXIII the former included in the papal numbering, which erroneously contained a fictitious John XV who was thought to have ruled for a few weeks immediately prior to the true John (985-96). John (surnamed Lackland) 1167-1216 was the king of England from 1199 youngest son of Henry II born in Oxford. He attempted to seize the crown during Richard I's captivity in Austria, but was pardoned and nominated his successor by his brother on his deathbed. He was crowned at Westminster on 27th May 1199. He alienated barons by bad administration and heavy taxation and was forced to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymeade on 15th June 1215. It was also the name of two kings of France John I (1316) who lived only seven days, and John II (1319-64) taken prisoner at Poitiers by the Black Prince, returned to captivity in England when he could not raise ransom money agreed upon, and died in London. Don John (1545-78) was the natural son of emperor Charles V. He commanded the fleet of victory of Lepanto, over the Turkish fleet, and was governor-general of the Netherlands in 1576-8. John Sobieski (1624-96) was the King of Poland, National hero and elected as John III, in 1764 he recovered the greater part of the Ukraine from the Turks. The earliest Polish surnames were patronymic. The personal names from which they were derived were mainly Slavonic, but as the Middle Ages progressed, traditional Slavic given names, began to give way to saint's names, mainly of Latin origin. Surnames derived from Slavonic personal names are of early origin, and tend to be borne by aristocratic families.<br>  <br>  Oh, yeah. You have a family crest, too. Too bad we can't post pics here.

Since they don't recognize the individual, anything an individual does threatens their ideal of what the group should be.<br>  <br>  So discussing, for example, the "thug-life" culture in the urban gutters that leads to punks killing people by age 15 is absolutely unacceptable, because they can't make a distinction between the ignorant thugs and those who actually work for a living.<br>  <br>  Whites aren't a specially protected class, so the same taboo doesn't apply to discussing white trash (hillbillies and whacko meth makers) as black trash.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	Fact: Every race, gender, age, and religion kill more than each other. That's just a stereotype right there. There are always serial killers in each race, so you can't judge.|`|VG7k5QRFaa	Because blacks don't kill more than whites.  <br>  <br>  1. Whites own the statistics first of all.  <br>  <br>  2. Second of all, the media focuses more on mentioning that blacks are the culprits when they commit crimes and get jailtime as opposed to pretending the person has no race when whites do the same crimes that blacks do.<br>  <br>  3. In white neighborhoods, many of the crimes aren't reported to keep the reputation of the neighborhood on a high level.  Blacks don't do this.  They report most of the crimes in their area, though there's a stereotype that they won't talk to the cops.  <br>  <br>  4. The Mafia kills but people don't report it and then are surprised that their "nice" neighbors are the ones who have been responsible for the missing people.  The Bloods and Crips kill and the police lock down the neighborhood searching for them.  A Mafia movie is considered up for an Oscar, and a black movie about gangs is dismissed as garbage.<br>  <br>  5. The drugs blacks use and sell on the streets get greater prison sentences which leads to more fighting and killing among them as opposed to the little white girl who snorts coke in her bathroom and gets away with it, the white guy in his Jaguar who gets high on his way to company meetings or the white drug lord who lives in a palace and hires blacks on the street to kill one another.<br>  <br>  As for men killing more than women...that's because women didn't have the power yet.  As women get more rights, their tendency to commit violence, kill, steal and use drugs has gone up.  Men and women would do the same thing if they had power / domination over the other group.  Both have people that would kill in a heartbeat.|`|3lnICFrgaa	Racial comments are always going to be more offensive, and the fact that men kill more is common knowledge. <br>  <br>  If that comment fell on discerning ears, and they sought out the evidence, I would hope that they would be able to accept it; but it's understandable if it offends them.<br>  <br>  Of course, the evidence could be wrong, so really it's all about research.|`|h7CvumEmaa	i think that you should be able to say it.<br>  <br>  but i just want to say something about the stats that you linked to.  while they may be correct, it is just going off of the amount of people being convicted and actually charged for those crimes. and we all know that blacks get arrested and convicted more than white people because of racism in the courtroom and the police department.|`|tvzzSCSGaa	Well probably because it'd reinforce already negative and damaging stereotypes. And just saying 'blacks' is not really good enough, as it focuses on skin colour rather than the real issues, (such as social disadvantage) that lead to high murder rates (I assume you mean in gangs and suchlike)|`|1ysTGwtqaa	cause poeple are P U S S I E S and don't accept the truth cause they feel bad cause they were once the white people's slaves|`|3uiIrxojaa	You're kinda right|`|FzP1NtRRaa	because people are afraid that's why
M7r8oaUzaa	I do believe so..|`|KXQVRQdjaa	I'm not sure I understand.  Do you think that agnosticism leads to religious conflict?  Did you perhaps use a double negative?<br>  <br>  Since an agnostic is someone who doesn't claim to know the truth about god, I would say that the world would be better if we we all admitted that we ARE agnostic.  No matter what one's religious belief, we can't actually *know.*  So we are all agnostic no matter what we *believe.*  You can one hundred percent BELIEVE something, but you don't necessarily KNOW, and in the case of gods, no one does.  NO ONE.  <br>  <br>  Since no one knows the truth about gods, we are all agnostic.  The people who call themselves agnostics, though are the ones who **admit** that they don't know everything.  It's true, whether you admit it or not.  Being agnostic is not a choice, it is a state of being that we are all in.  Many people stubbornly refuse to believe that they are, but that doesn't change that fact.<br>  <br>  If the whole world would figure that out, people would stop picking fights over religion, not to mention being buttheads and trying to convert everyone!  If you learn to accept that your religion may not be the right one, you won't try to "save" everyone, which is a very condescending and rude practice.<br>  <br>  But Michael: "An agnostic who doesn't believe or disbelieve is actually conflicting with believers and non-believers at the same time."<br>  <br>  Not true: an agnostic's *beliefs* conflict with believers and non-believers, but a person who is agnostic doesn't conflict with anyone because they don't attack others for their beliefs.  Since they admit that they don't know the answer, they don't push other people around for being "wrong."  Only people who pretend they absolutely know one way or another start fights over it!  People who don't believe one hundred percent about god don't start wars to fight over it.  And also, not ALL of the world's religions encourage division.  You are overgeneralizing terribly!  My religion, and a lot of others, teach that all people are equal and should not conflict with others over differences.|`|AA11434633	No.  How can that be, when so many different religions believe that their's is the 'true' religion?<br>  <br>  You only have to look at what's happened over the centuries between competing religions to see the damage that's caused by having a religious belief.  I don't know if there's ever been a war fought in the name of agnosticism, but I doubt it.|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Not a bad question at all. I used to be agnostic based on 2 principles.<br>  <br>  1, Nothing can come from nothing, therefore since there is a universe, and we know it started at some point, something must have started it. Therefore its not possible to dismiss an unknown force.<br>  <br>  2, I refused to be arrogant enough to believe I knew the truth of our existence.<br>  <br>  But!!!!<br>  <br>  The notion of 'nothing' has now been dismissed. I see no reason to challenge the concept that the trace elements that always exist in the most 'empty' of spaces could not have led to the sparks that initiated existence.<br>  <br>  Also ... I'm growing more arrogant as I age!|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Everybody is agnostic. Nobody knows for sure whether God exists or not. People can be 99.9% sure that God does not exist. But they can't KNOW for certain whether he exists or not because you can't prove a negative statement.<br>  <br>  And you still need to decide whether you believe god exists or you don't. Thus, you can be an agnostic atheist or an agnostic theist. Just being "agnostic" shows that you don't understand the correct meaning of the word.|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	I say no. An agnostic may be considered a fence straddler by most but in reality it puts them right in the middle of two opposing forces..<br>  Believers>>>>>>>Agnostic<<<<<<<Non Believers.|`|oVHFz52Laa	No, the change starts with your own heart|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Buddha says: Simply dismiss the question to end the conflict.<br>  <br>  I have always been an atheist. OK, that is not completely true. I am not an atheist. I am not a believer. I am not an agnostic. I am none of these because the answer to god's existence is unimportant.<br>  <br>  I am what I am and what I am needs no excuses!<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself have real moral values perform mitzvahs not for the sake of salvation, but because moral codes and performing good deeds and helping those in need is the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically punish them.|`|yrJQHOOeaa	How can one avoid religious conflict? An agnostic who doesn't believe or disbelieve is actually conflicting with believers and non-believers at the same time. I cannot speak for an agnostic any more than I can for an atheist or christian... but I hold firm that every human has a right to freely choose what path to walk in this life. There will never be an end to religious conflict until there is an end to religious doctrines. Religion promotes division... that is something I think everyone can agree on to a certain point if they remain honest with themselves.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Agnosticism as avoidance of religious conflict? <br>  I would think that Agnosticism is the epitome of religious conflict.<br>  (To clarify, I was referring to inner conflict, between deciding whether God exists, or doesn't.  Those who have settled on a path, have decided what they think, and therefore no reason for inner conflict)|`|MqLxwsw7aa	No - All things happening in the world are just as much religious as they are political.  Conflict is inevitable because of the abominations going on in the world.|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	Agnosticism is also a religious belief that causes conflict.It was high in the Soviet Union. The politburo was mostly made up of agnostics.|`|uJO0MbShaa	No, people pick on you for being agnostic too.|`|4AavBJy8aa	surely religious conflict is due  to regions? not agnosticism|`|Iw9C17Braa	What Jack Hammer said is correct. Clearly people do not understand the term "Agnostic", and claims that it is some kind of middle ground or fence sitting, are extremely misguided and uneducated. If anything this is Ignostic.<br>  <br>  Unless you can say either:<br>  You know 100% that God exists, or<br>  You know 100% that God does not exist<br>  then you are in fact agnostic yourself.<br>  <br>  Agnosticism is not a belief like theism or atheism, it is a philosophy, based on the theory that there cannot be an absolute answer to a question that has some degree of doubt.<br>  <br>  So the question itself is incomplete. If by your question you mean, does agnosticism view give a greater degree of tolerance, then maybe. But I doubt it would stop conflict, since many conflicts are about power, and religion is only used as a means to justify the cause.<br>  <br>  Also you have to look at "religious conflict" itself. Many so called "religious" conflicts were not between two different religions at all, but but between two groups of the same religion who worship the same god from the same texts (Catholics & Protestants, Sunni & Shi'a etc.). In this case, do you really think that people's beliefs would make any difference, or would there not be another excuse for intolerance?|`|1RhDZnN7aa	How can God not exist when everybody knows about Him.<br>  <br>  One is always welcome to be an agnostic or non-believer if one so wishes. This is an irrefutable right.<br>  <br>  There is no conflict caused. Only debate amongst those who wish to participate.
djpRvB3taa	I've heard many stories and lots of ways that people have become vampires, but i also know from personnal experience, that these people are not all liars.  A lot of them fear what they are, but obviously, the posers and twilight readers need to lay off!<br>  Its getting pretty annoying. But anyway.... the real vampires fear that people will kill them. They hide what they are because of what we can do to them. So...they aren't like the evil vampires you hear in books. No. Not even close. Well....not the bad ones at least.<br>  <br>  If you want, i can answer questions you would like to know?<br>  :D|`|yCTxg4t5aa	You can not become a vampire, your either born one or your not. There are those out there that claim to be able to "Change or Embrace" someone, these people are predators and should be avoided, and i mean predator as in pedophile or murderer not prince of darkness who's going to suck you dry. <br>  <br>  Some others say it is possible but the information is not freely given and no one will do it because in a spiritual sense it's like Mutilating your soul, in a physical sense it's like purposely giving a healthy person diabetes and a needle full of insulin that doesn't work properly. It can be damaging for both people involved. It's still a pretty taboo topic in the community, we tend to be a bit aggressive when people come into our forums asking to be "Turned".|`|c22c40cfa6cec9043bff4a9fd7529e69aa	these days the people who act as a vampires are people who are desperately in need of attention and people to follow them.   I saw this wacko on tyra who claimed to be one actually i saw a few and they were hilarious.  they  were so full of themselves.  they say they feed of your energy and drain you mentally.  it sounds like They are manic depressants  who have nothing constructive to do.    if you are interested in those people you should look into how many of them prolly need some sort of medication for some mental problem they most likely have! i think they healthy people in america forget that there are alot of people with a few screws loose.  so keep that in mind on your quest.|`|fc6bFYHvaa	My experience was just amazing.

If God is all knowing how does he not know that Adam and Eve will not eat the apple. If God is so good why would he not stop murder? If God cast Satan out of Heaven why can't he stop people for falling for his trap. Is it Gods Will that people die every single day? That women get raped? Children lose their parents? You may say he is the one stopping more from happening but if he was omnipotent he should be able to stop satan. It's not logical. What about stillbirths i thought he was against abortion. You can't prove that he exists. People believe what people around them believe and if you were raised believing in God then what is the chance that you are gonna reject it.

Those guys think they are cool and wear shades all the time.

rh2cRpMHaa	I prefer not to use them, but just because they are awkward... I wouldn't care if another guy looked or anything O___o|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Lots of guys don't, for a variety of reasons. I usually will use them.|`|zRPXczxAaa	There's an etiquette of urinal use precisely because all men feel  this way.  (1)  Never take a urinal immediately next to one that another guy is using.  (2)  Lean in close, arms akimbo, keeping your hands around your jewels.  (3)  Except for necessary aim and alignment, keep your eyes straight ahead.  (4)  Under no circumstances acknowledge anybody else's presence in the men's room by smile, glance, word or gesture.  This may not ensure that your private bits have not been looked at (though it would have been difficult--and you'd have noticed anybody really looking), but it does prevent your seeing anybody else's goods, and if anybody else has looked at yours, you won't know about it.|`|akvrwpywaa	I do when there's no one else around.  I don't want people seeing my stuff, especially since there's so many gay people (no offense) and the occasional girl that go into the men's bathroom.

Unfortunately it seems that so many people don't understand that the restroom is a place of urination, defecation, and other such private manners, not of socializing or looking at other people's genitalia.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Yes.

However I personally don't see a big deal with it. All of us males are the same, if someone else happens to see you at the urinal, so... you don't have anything that he doesn't have. I can urinate at a urinal with no problem. I find them to be quicker and convenient, because you don't have to take the time to walk into a stall, lift the sit, ect. You can just walk up to the urinal and do you business. I will usually use one instead of having to go into a stall.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|WNIL4sLiaa	In most cases you are just paranoid. But, there is the odd chance someone may take a peek.<br>  Just lean more into the urinal and that makes it impossible for someone on either side to take a gander at your equipment.|`|d8PLf8Ciaa	i use urinals, dono why but it feels good to fly my flag proud haha. i dont think you should worry about others looking. there probably just trying to compare.|`|mbnOUkALaa	I don't, and for the same reason, but I am paranoid so I can't help you there.

My guess is that you are looking for one that would teach things you already believe.  If that is the case, why not form your own, or just continue being yourself and forget about it?  Search for truth by doing your own personal study, using many sacred books and writings from all over the world, and see what you personally think.  You will learn more and maybe draw closer to a real God that way than you would in the corrupt and plentiful established religions on this planet.<br>  <br>  Do you feel that celibrating nature as evidence of creation is good?<br>  Do you think that the most important rules to live by are harm nobody, including yourself, but otherwise seek happiness?<br>  Do you feel that we are all responsible for our own actions?<br>  <br>  Those beliefs fit most Pagan religions, especially Wicca, believe it or not.  There's just no telling what is best for you - and you said nothing about yourself in asking the question... I don't believe most people have a good enough reason for their religion of choice.  Many times it's just that their parents were this or that, or something sounded good to them.  Rarely do they really do the years of research to have something to base their beliefs on.  Do you need someone to tell you what to believe, and will their word alone motivate such belief?<br>  <br>  I am harder to convince than that, and I hope you will decide to be too.  Those of us not content to sit in a pew and be told how things are may think too freely for most religious persons' comfort, but we are also the ones who create the world tomorrow, and opening our minds will lead to more open minds in future generations.  That is my hope.|`|3KcdSxF5aa	well this dosnt count but atheist.... why because there is no eveidence to belive in any god why should i?|`|Z7kZdBkXaa	Agnostic / Atheist<br>  because religion invokes prejudice which leads to so many problems on this planet.<br>  <br>  The basis for religion is there, faith and such, but it is implemented the wrong way which leads to many religion based conflicts ie. the current situation between israel and palestine.<br>  <br>  But if i had to pick one, Buddhism because they promote peacefulness, happiness and karma.

I'm grateful for life and I want to start living, whereas before, I hated my life and wanted to die. I never knew that there was as powerful a love in the universe until I let Him into my life. I'm getting stronger every day. And I have more compassion for life and for people in general than I did before. I want to help people, not hurt them. Jesus said: "I am the way, the truth, and the life." And He speaks truth. I found out by believing. Every day with Him is a new and wonderful experience. I would recommend Him to anyone wiling to listen and have a little faith. He's the best friend I've ever had and a great teacher too. :)|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Catholic, because it is the will of God for all mankind.

It has canonical prohibitions:  (1)  Obey no one.  (2)  Never follow an order.  (3)  Never give an order.

When I see them, they look like balls of light. <br>  If you want to attract the fae to you, you can try leaving them offerings of milk, honey, alcohol, bread, etc. for them. THat's how I started working with them.|`|71qGan9Raa	Fairies (or as some people write Faeries) exist everywhere. I think they are in every living plant. Heck, they love to hide things in my house. Once I say, okay, I give up fairies, they'll put it on top of something where I've already looked a million times. They've done it to me so often this year, it's just a thing we say in the house now, "The fairies have it."    They always return it they just don't want us being so serious about things. I also know it will be returned so I don't worry about missing items anymore.<br>  So, YES, fairies and pixies definitely exist!!! I believe somewhere in New York they actually discovered these little people.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Well my Grandparents' emigrated from  Ireland & they used to tell us stories about the Wee people & on the eve of St.Patricks' Day they put bread & whiskey outside their door for the Wee people & any Leprechauns' that  might come around I'm not saying the folklore is true but I enjoy the idea|`|8jK33jK1aa	Yes, I believe they do and if you want a chance to see one then visit Ireland.|`|u3mRTnRLaa	no|`|yo54xat6aa	Yes I do believe they exist. I've heard they live in Ireland and Scotland too.  I heard their Fairy Queen's name is Lilith.  <br>  <br>  I've personally never seen one, but have heard it's more likely for a native to see them as you said.  <br>  <br>  I've also heard in Ireland, if you see a very small tree that stands out, its home to fairies.  Like if there are normal-sized trees, kinda big, all around, but this small one seems out of place.  It would probably be the size of a bush, but of course not a bush, cause it'll have the right proportion of a tree.<br>  <br>  I've also read, that they are generally happy, but you can feel a solemn-quality too about them, as if they've been somehow banished from the garden of eden as well...<br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|LKRXCFuWaa	Well I'll be honest with you. In the past I would have answered no quickly and without reservations. After I spent time in England a few years ago visiting my cousin, I noticed a strange twinge in the air. Little things would happen, things would be moved, a bit of strangeness here and there.<br>  <br>  So I looked around and listened. One night while I was there, just for fun, I left out some cake. the next morning it was gone. Could have been a mouse or something else, but that same morning, I noticed a few articles of clothing I thought were dirty were clean. Now, I could have been mistaken, but it was strange.<br>  <br>  So maybe there is something. Maybe they're angels of some kind that are allowed to interact with people? Maybe they're some other kind of spirit that found a home in the british isles? Who knows...|`|33E9E96iaa	It has never been proven. If it was proven, there'd be a huge fuss.

And if a person is never water baptised, they are of course still saved if they are a believer. <br>  <br>  The thief on the cross was never water baptised. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	Oh, I was baptized.

I personally disagree with infant baptism because I think it discourages people from further exploring their faith. I think baptism is an extremely personal decision, one to be made between you and Jesus, and is not to be taken lightly.<br>  <br>  They will do it when they are called to. You believe that Jesus will show them the way, and he will, when it's time.|`|tOh85To7aa	No I don't over look them I do know how to rightly divide the truth,If being baptized was the only way to be saved then what happened to the man on the cross right there with Jesus,he certainly didn't have time to get baptized,but he sure is in Heaven with Jesus.|`|xhHxhai5aa	alot of people nowadays are against INFANT baptisms because a baptism is a conscious decision between the individual and God.

KBBonf97aa	Actually, you don't have to have a sexual experience to know what your sexual orientation is.  Any human can enjoy physical stimulation from another person and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation.  A gay man can enjoy sex with a woman, but it doesn't make him bisexual or straight any more than a lesbian turns bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them.  But sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  And very often, it doesn't make itself clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why there are so many teenage girls who identify as bisexual, but very few people in their 20s or older who don't identify as either straight or gay.  The kids are jumping to a conclusion based on temporary hormonal impulses, rather than waiting until their true sexual orientation makes itself known.<br>  <br>  Most people who experiment in hopes of determining their sexual orientation actually wind up more confused than they were before, since just about everyone enjoys sex.  If you're not sure of your orientation, "dabbling" won't provide you with answers.  It will only confirm that you're a human and capable of being sexually stimulated.  <br>  <br>  Just be patient, since it's normal for girls to be curious and unsure of their orientation at 17.  But you don't get to decide what it is, so let nature do the work for you.  In a few years, everything will be perfectly clear and you'll know exactly who you're meant to be.|`|AA10199093	Las Vegas - Krave <br>  I hear it's a great experience for straights and gays, men and women.|`|6o42rxK9aa	By the sound of it, yes your Bi.<br>  I can't really suggest a good way to meet other BIs or lesbian girls really, without going to these speed dating things, or advertising yourself on Myspace...<br>  Just go with the flow.<br>  All i can suggest is like you say, don't hide it, make it known that your BI/Lesbian, so others can find you easier.|`|364f2af929520dfb5f9cb218e970ddaeaa	hetero-jazz n homo-jazz =).... lol<br>  <br>  You could try the gyc....

eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  Be the best example of Jesus Christ that you can be.  I think it is very difficult to talk about salvation with close family members when they are not open to talking about Jesus Christ.  It is extra difficult because you care more about your family than you care about most people.   We should love everyone,  but we naturally feel extra close to our family.  That can make it hard for us to remain calm when a family member resists important information - we're inclined to get angry and loud,  because we fear for the person's well-being.   We want to join our family in heaven some day.<br>  <br>  I think you should try to talk with your little sister by asking her questions gently.  Talk with her while you are doing something fun.  Also keep in mind that you should pray always for the conversion of all non-believers.   Remember to trust God to make Himself known to others.   <br>  <br>  Do you attend church services?  You should, if at all possible. Tell your parents that you would like to attend as a family.  With Easter coming up, you might be able to talk them into going to church on easter Sunday.  Many people attend church services for the first time on major celebration days like Easter.  Some of them start a new habit that way. <br>  <br>  If your parents won't agree to go to church,  maybe you could take your little sister by yourself.  You could also go with another family.  It can be a real motivator to some parents to start going to church when their children's friends' parents start picking them up to go to church.   <br>  <br>  Be as good an example as you can be of a sincere Christian.  Show your family your faith in your actions.  Sometimes you should mention that you are doing something - or not doing something, because you think that is how God wants you to behave.   Be kind to a lonely neighbor, or volunteer at a senior citizen center or hospital.  Don't brag about your good acts,  but tell your family - especially your little sister,  that you do these things to live according to God's Will.  <br>  <br>  Put up Christian sayings on your bedroom walls, and on your bedroom door.  Your little sister will see these things.  Speak with her gently, as if you were talking to Jesus.  I think one of the best things to do in talking with non-believers about Jesus is to use the tone of voice you would use if you were talking to Jesus Himself.  Show your gentle and genuine love in all that you do.   <br>  <br>  Be patient,  and never give up.<br>  Don't badger anyone - especially your mother and father.   Lead by example, and be happy.  Join a Christian social group, and take your little sister with you if that is possible.  Invite Christian friends to your home,  and make sure you and your friends are kind to the family - especially your sister.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I am praying as I write this for the  happiness and eternal salvation of you and your family.   It's not easy to stay faithful to God when you feel alone in your faith.   Stay gently firm in your faith - and pray often to grow stronger.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	The best way is to be the best and most loving family member you can be.  <br>  <br>  To see what I'm talking about, read "The Celtic Way of Evangelism" and relate it to being in your family.  <br>  <br>  And don't be impatient -- this could take many, many years.<br>  _______________<br>  Ok people -- if you haven't even read the book (and you probably haven't)  why are you giving me thumbs-down?|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	My pastor had told me about being a Christian in a family of no Christians. I personally have experienced this. You got the real thing, and the family thinks they are "it", but when you talk about Jesus they practically fight with you about it.<br>  <br>  He is the thing; you continue to learn about Christ, what it is to be a Christian, and when things come up, you have a chance to tell them the truth. I found my mother's death one of those times. <br>  <br>  My dad asked me and my brother to say a prayer for her at the funeral. We both could barely believe he asked. We both asked, "Why?!" We were incredulous.<br>  <br>  My dad got a little mad (which is typical at first for anything), and then said, "well, so that you can say something nice so that she could get into heaven."<br>  <br>  Our answer was the same, "You are supposed to take care of that before you die."<br>  <br>  It was difficult, because that was his wife, our mother, who died. Sensitivity was high, but the truth had to be said. <br>  <br>  So when the times come, try to be prepared. Don't back off telling them the truth, even if they hate you for it. <br>  <br>  Because of their stubbornness you may learn the meaning of this:<br>  <br>  Luke 14:26<br>  "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be my disciple."<br>  <br>  Prepare yourself, that time is coming.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Nothing has inspired more hate, degredation and theocrcay than the myth of Christ.

We don't push. We respect  others and their beliefs and expect the same respect in return. We are very aware that telling someone they're practicing their version of faith "the wrong way" is going to make them resistant to practicing the "proper" way. It will drive them away rather than draw them in, in other words. We set an example through our everyday actions, not just with platitudes.<br>  <br>  Try it that way. You may be surprised. At the very least you won't be causing dissension in your own household.|`|apnOVubMaa	By reading some of the rather harsh/rude answers you have received, it sounds like your question touched on a sore spot with some folks. As far as sharing Christ with your family, here are a few suggestions:<br>  1) A changed life speaks volumes of God's power. Be sure your own life is a consistent witness.<br>  2) Remember that it is the Holy Spirit that does the "convincing." Look for opportunities to share your own experience. Perhaps that will generate some questions and further opportunities to show the relevance of Bible answers.<br>  3) Pray, pray, pray...<br>  Hang in there,<br>  Miss Leslie's Son|`|xkBXhSppaa	Hey<br>  <br>   This is a quite  a test and many do go through this.<br>  <br>   - First pray daily that God will bring them to grow deeper in the  Lord<br>     and save them.<br>  <br>     ( This i from my experience)<br>  <br>   - Start playing religious music ( this will slowly sink into their soul)<br>   - Watch crusades or Benny Hinn like programs so your parents <br>      start to wonder a bit<br>  <br>   - Try saying grace during eating<br>   - Get a children's bible for your sis<br>   - When a disaster strikes make it an opportunity for the whole family<br>     to pray together ( implore the Lord to answer) so that can lead<br>     to a conviction and acceptance.<br>  <br>    <br>  Pray dear one pray.

A good example is Yusuf Estes.<br>  <br>  If you feel like it's the truth, you trust it and feel it's the way it should be, then don't lose your believe in Allah and trust that he'll help you pass any obstacles on that way.

Also the god of Islam and the God of Christianity are not the same as some would have you believe. If you study Islam closely you will notice that it contradicts many basic Christian beliefs. If you want further reading material, there is a wonderful book written from a strictly scientific point of view called The Case For Christ, I will put the link below.

John 20:17 KJV >>> <br>  and in alot of other places ..<br>  notice the word -Our God - that jesus said this means that we have a common God we and jesus, God means creator this means we r both created and raised by the same God,, we as well as jesus<br>  <br>  jesus always admitted and declared with hight Voice that he worships Our God that is in the heaven and invited us to worship him how can he be God after that<br>  we always see jesus saying (my God) and praying to him why don't we just worship the God of jesus , that is; the creator of jesus<br>  its amazing how jesus used to call God : (My God) and (Our God ) many times in the bible , God is the one who creats and rises that means jesus always used to say : (my creator).<br>  which agrees with islam view of jesus as human prophet and no more than that.<br>  <br>  Mary <peace be upon her><br>  also mary is considered in islam , as a very great woman and the purest woman on earth , but not as mother of God !! whom he had made pregnant !! , nor his gf!<br>  <br>  <br>  HolySpirit<br>  the holy spirit is considered as the head of angels and he it is called gebrael , but its not a part of God nor any divine , he is just a creation of the One and Only true God that is in heaven .<br>  <br>  edit addition:<br>  <br>  2- Upon reading quran i found many amazing facts from those i found is scientific facts or miracles i will mention some of them:<br>  <br>  Few miracles Of Quran <br>  Big Bang<br>  When describing the creation of the "heavens and the earth," the Qur'an states the theory of the "Big Bang" explosion at the start of it . the Qur'an says that "the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before they were aparted: <br>  Quran (21:30) {Have not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece, then We cloved them asunder} [cloved them asunder means separated them].<br>  and this was 1400 years before the discovery of the big bang theory.<br>  <br>  Expansion of Universe<br>  this amazing theory was discovered in the 20th century that the universe is continuing to expand after the big bang explosion,, <br>  this idea ; that the universe is continuing to expand. was mentioned in quran 1430 years ago : {and The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are still expanding it} quran (51:47).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  furthermore, In nicia council constantine forced people on only 4 gosepels , and burned alot of gosepels that said jesus was only a human prophet no more, and he killed those who oposed trinity , thus forcing trinity on christians ,<br>  <br>  Constantine was a roman pagan all his life , he wanted to be called christian but he also wanted to maintain his roman believes , so what he did was that he inserted the pagan beliefs of trinity and idol or statues glorifying and worshiping into christianity , thus deviating christianity from the true word of God ..<br>  <br>  thats why nowadays muslims r the real christians (followers of jesus) cause they follow the belief that jesus used to believe and the things he used to command , and they dont follow a diverted or a pagan originated believe.<br>  <br>  Conclusion: <br>  <br>  finally and in conclusion... The concept of God taught by Islam is, the Supreme being who is uncreated , anyone who is created, born or dies is not God.<br>  <br>  islam is simplicity , clearness , direct teachings , and absolute uniqness of God , no embeded paganism or multi Gods.<br>  <br>  i found that islam is the only religion that claims absolute uniqness of God and really means it and thus islam is the only religion today that follow the first commandment of all commandments to moses and jesus and mohammed which is :<br>  <br>  "For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, [is] a jealous God:" [Exodus 34:14]<br>  and jesus said:<br>  after one of the scribes asked him Which is the first commandment of all? Jesus answered him, "The first of all commandments is, Hear, O Israel The Lord our God is one Lord" [Mark 12:28to33] <br>  and in Quran : "Say, He is God, The One and Only" (112:1) <br>  amen.|`|Kg9pD955aa	ISLAM IS THE WAY OF LIFE.<br>  ISLAM MEANS PEACE!<br>  ISLAM IS REAL RELIGION!<br>  ISLAM IS THE BEST THOUGHT!<br>  ISLAM IS DEALS WITH THE EVERY THING IN LIFE<br>  & AFTER DEATH!<br>  THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING YOU TO BA CHRISTIAN HAD NOT SEEN THE DR.

BTpNkxoeaa	I can vouch for Seattle because I'm from the area.  Very friendly towards crossdressers and other trans folks, especially on Capitol Hill.  Surrounding areas aren't too bad either.  San Francisco is of course legendary in acceptance towards crossdressers.  Other places than what you mentioned are Portland, LA, Chicago, Miami, New York, DC, Phildelphia, New Orleans and Minneapolis.  North of the border, you have Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.<br>  <br>  You don't have to limit your job search to those areas.  13 states along with dozens of local governments and a considerable number of major coprorations have a non-discrimination policy on gender identity or gender expression.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.transgenderlaw.org/ndlaws/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.transgenderlaw.org/ndlaws/ind...</a>|`|Wmxpi9Amaa	Heh.

P544Sbmqaa	I think its wrong to force religion on anyone.  A huge majority of the world believes in some sort of religion or spirituality.  And even though from ideal to ideal the specifics may be different, the core are all the same, and that core is about teaching the difference from right and wrong.  I believe your personal choice of religion is just that...  a personal choice and that it is NOT my right to tell you what to think or believe.|`|7Bj4AAo8aa	That's nothing compared to this:<br>  <br>  Kill everything that "breathes":<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 20:16<br>  However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes.<br>  <br>  Happiness in dashing Babylonian infants:<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:9<br>  "O the happiness of him who doth seize, And hath dashed thy sucklings on the rock!"<br>  <br>  Kill all the kids and all non-virgin women(including chaste married women):<br>  <br>  Numbers 31:17<br>  "Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known a man by sleeping with him."|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	Whether it is the right or wrong faith, it is still wrong to force it.

f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	"I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit".  Some Protestant churches may use a different formula, but this is the one Jesus Christ commanded us to use.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	The apostles always baptized in the name of Jesus. So those who follow their example today, will usually say something along the lines of:<br>  "I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."<br>  <br>  This is in obedience to Acts 2:38, and the example of the apostles throughout Acts. Baptizing in Jesus' name does not contradict the command of Jesus in Matthew 28:19. Jesus never said to baptize in the titles, but in the NAME. What is the NAME? Obviously, the apostles believed it was Jesus.

Read the Wikipedia article on "French language" so that you can get a general sense of the language.<br>  2.  Check out free podcasts for learning French.  Some I recommend are FrenchPod101(.com) and FrenchPodClass(.com).<br>  3.  Do the LiveMocha for French (LiveMocha.com, of course).<br>  4.  Get Rosetta Stone because it really is the best thing out there.  Don't forget to use it.<br>  5.Read "Easy French Reader" and "French Demystified;" they're good books. <br>  6.  If you want to learn more, go to a university and ask if they offer placement for French.  Take the placement test, and they'll put you into the appropriate level class.<br>  7. Subscribe to Netflix and rent and watch French-language films without subtitles and/or watch your own DVDs with French subtitles or dubbing.<br>  8.  Try studying in France or some French-speaking country.<br>  <br>  DON'T get Instant Immersion or Berlitz stuff, they're junk.|`|fsiXYWEvaa	Take a class|`|J7zuXJ61aa	In the USA we have this academy called 'The SMB Dog Booth' which is a very good French academy.

However, lower class people normally make a big mistake by saying "La presidenta" which is totally wrong.

5515fbe4bde3824ce5a0d6e4b8fde157aa	I think it's more sub than counter, but I could see both arguments.<br>  <br>  I think that, no matter how much the Indie scene WISHES it were counterculture, it still runs very closely along the same sold out values. There are Indie movies with Indie music that goes WAAAYYY mainstream. I think that the Indie artists secretly want mainstream but that would mean more popularity and, ultimately, more money.<br>  <br>  How many artists you know were SO counterculture that when they were accepted by the mainstream they quit doing what they were doing?<br>  <br>  That's what makes them subcultural, to me at least.

The Bible is God's revelation of truth to humanity, therefore it can be seen as "God's Word". But that doesn't mean that every word in the Bible is God speaking. Obviously you read an account of someone telling a lie and that is not as it were "God's Word". Rather it is God's truthful account of what happened for us to learn from.

The term is particularly associated with the supernatural factors in Christianity. To the Lat. miraculum correspond Gr. τ?ρα? in the New Testament, and Heb. ??? (Exod. xv. 11; Dan. xii. 6) in the Old Testament. Other terms used in the New Testament are δ?ναμι? “with reference to the power residing in the miracle worker” (cf. ????? Deut. iii. 24 and ????? Num. xvi. 30), and ρημε?ον “with reference to the character or claims of which it was the witness and guarantee” (cf. ???? Exod. iv. 8); that the power is assumed to be from God is shown by the phrases πνε?ματι θεο? (Matt. xii. 28; cf. Luke iv. .18) and δακτ?λω θεο? (Luke xi. 20).<br>  Wikipedia:<br>  A miracle is a sensibly perceptible interruption of the laws of nature, such that can only be explained by divine intervention, and is sometimes associated with a miracle-worker. Many folktales, religious texts, and people claim various events they refer to as "miraculous". People in different cultures have substantially different definitions of the word "miracle." Even within a specific religion there is often more than one of the term. Sometimes the term "miracle" may refer to the action of a supernatural being that is not a god. Thus, the term "divine intervention," by contrast, would refer specifically to the direct involvement of a deity.<br>  <br>  Need I go on?<br>  <br>  I don't know where you nose is, but this is just some I found in front of mine without looking too hard. In essence:<br>  <br>  Magic is Man attempting to influence natural laws by trying to force the supernatural to do his bidding.<br>  Miracle is when God intervines by doing.|`|jBYxEX8taa	The bible is from God. The views on magic from God and man differ. Although Gods view is perfect. Humans are flawed.<br>  <br>  Magic can maybe heal people, but that's not to say it is from God.

Also, the word magic has other definitions that absolutely do not describe miracles.  I wouldn't use it so as to avoid misunderstanding or confusion.  <br>  <br>  "Not everything hard to believe can be quantified as a miracle according to scriptural standards. Miracles are those acts that only God can perform; usually superceding natural laws. Baker's Dictionary of the Bible defines a miracle as "an event in the external world brought about by the immediate agency or the simple volition of God." It goes on to add that a miracle occurs to show that the power behind it is not limited to the laws of matter or mind as it interrupts fixed natural laws. So the term supernatural applies quite accurately.<br>  <br>  It's very interesting that a common word used for miracle in the New Testament can also be translated "sign." A miracle is a sign that God uses to point to Himself; the same way we follow signs to find a museum or an airport."<br>  <a href="http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/b.4222629/k.EE2A/What_is_a_Biblical_Definition_of_Miracle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/...</a>

They had a great future ahead of them if they had been obedient one must presume, but they rebelled. <br>  <br>  The LORD God had created them, it was for God to lay down His rules and it was for mankind to obey. Gods can be any old lump of stone that's worshipped or a people who know it all in their own minds. It takes them away from the LORD God and salvation. We can see this with all the nations that sacrificed their children to their gods and practised great immorality.|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	He disobeyed him. Besides, Satan was lying about the fruit from the tree making the person a god|`|dmTVbpcWaa	This apparently did not mean merely having knowledge of what was good and what was bad for them, for the first man and woman had such knowledge by reason of God’s commands to them. Furthermore, God’s words at Genesis 3:22 could not pertain to their now knowing what was bad by experience, for Jehovah said that they had become like him and he has not learned what is bad by doing it. (Ps 92:14,?15) Evidently, Adam and Eve got to know what was good and what was bad in the special sense of now judging for themselves what was good and what was bad. They were idolatrously placing their judgment above God’s, disobediently becoming a law to themselves, as it were, instead of obeying Jehovah, who has both the right and the wisdom necessary to determine good and bad. So their independent knowledge, or standard, of good and bad was not like that of Jehovah. Rather, it was one that led them to misery.|`|VRl1jENHaa	No, no, no -- you have it all wrong.  BEFORE Adam and Eve ate of the fruit, they had full access to ALL trees (except for the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil) -- this INCLUDED the Tree of Life.  But AFTER they ate, they no longer deserved access to the Tree of Life, so they were banished from its presence.|`|XiITTg3waa	THE ISSUE IS OBEDIENCE ,,,,IF WE BELONG TO GOD THEN WE LIVE IN OBEDIENCE !!<br>  <br>  JESUS SAID IF YOU LOVE HIM THEN WE WILL OBEY HIM !!!<br>  <br>  <br>   CAN'T BE ANY OTHER WAY ,, IF WE DO NOT LIVE IN OBEDIENCE AND REPENTANCE WE ARE NOT SAVED !!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	We are to worship God not ourselves.
yrJQHOOeaa	To religious people... no. To non-religious... yes. How can one lose time by doing what he or she believes is actually making use of their time? Who are we to decide what is the proper use of time for another being? An atheist believes in no deity. Therefore, an atheist believes worshiping a deity is a waste of time. The only way to "waste time" is to walk a path that does not support your beliefs. Just because I do not believe in god does not mean that he doesn't exist to others. Understanding this is a step towards transcending ignorance.|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	He gave you an extra day every year to do with what you want. Actually a day and a quarter extra.

But when someone in a wheel chair appears to be having trouble it's considered rude to give assistance without asking first.  If you asked and they said yes, they would appreciate your help, then it's ok. But to just go and push someone's chair like that would be considered shoving and also demeaning.<br>  <br>  It would be the same as if a woman were hammering a nail into something and a man walked up to her, grabbed the hammer, and said he'd do it because he knows how.  That would be rude.<br>  <br>  But you didn't say, did you ask first and he accepted your offer of help?  I mean I'd hate to be learning how to maneuver a chair around and be trying to figure out how to get over a door's threshold and have someone come up behind me and shove me over just so they could get through the door.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	no
hceNM6Uxaa	The book is meant to be humorous.  I found these two customer reviews on Amazon.com.<br>  First, the favourable one:<br>  "This is not your mother's book on marrying Jewish (or not). It's totally tongue in cheek, and I must say I laughed my way through the entire book. The biblical references are reworked to fit the book's concept of the trials and tribulations of being Jewish and seeking love and long term commitment in today's world. Very clever overall. "<br>  And the less favourable one:<br>  "This is not really a book, but a short booklet. <br>  Rather two very short booklets - one for men about women and one for women about men - pasted together back to back. <br>  <br>  the level of humor in this book is pathetic. I couldn't find ONE funny line. it is not informative. It is not funny. it offers nothing but a waste of about 30 minutes of your time"<br>  <br>  The moral of this story is - don't assume something is serious; it may be entirely tongue-in-cheek.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	There are high rates of intermarriage among jews for the simple fact that most jews are secular (not religious) and see no problem with marrying someone who isn't jewish.<br>  <br>  Most of them are not intentionally looking for a woman who specifically isn't jewish, they just aren't only looking for one who specifically is.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	There is actually a documentary that was recently released that discusses some of the issues, trains of thought and philosophies in regards to intermarriage (which I will link you to below). <br>  <br>  The problem with that statistic is that if this was in reference to the United States, where only 2.2% of the population is Jewish, then what you are looking at is a cut in half of the Jewish population.<br>  <br>  If this is in reference to the entire world, where the Jewish population in its' entirety makes up 0.22% of people, then it is also a fairly significant number. <br>  <br>  As for finding a Jewish man: I haven't really looked, as I'm not really in a position to date at the moment, but there are a number of Jewish websites that offer dating services (frumster, saw you at sinai, etc).|`|dhto1A3caa	The correct book to read is a serious book, not a book of humor. The best book around for this subject is called "Why Be Jewish" by Meir Kahane. The book explains why Jewish men run away from their religion. Meir Kahane was not afraid to speak the truth about any issue. In this book he writes about assimiliation and intermarriage

Besides all of the positive evidence that the God of the Bible does exist and is our Creator, the only way to prove something doesn't exist is to prove that it is impossible for it to exist since we cannot know what exists everywhere in this universe.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You didn't understand it all. It wasn't saying that God doesn't exist. It was saying that because He exists, you can't win in a dispute.<br>  <br>  How could you jumble it like that...a rare 'talent' :)
AA11232725	Many of you said that would be magic, not a miracle. Care to clarify?<br>  <br>  Those who gave that reply were mistaken. Magic is either the art of illusion or if it has a supernatural element then the power comes from demonic forces. The difference is where the power comes from, not whether Jesus made wine out of water or air.|`|avVdKiWKaa	I was gonna say one can make a basket from mid-court and the other is Smokey Robinson, but I guess this just isn't the time or place.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	A miracle is a blessing from God.<br>  Magic is performed.  :D|`|f3nwI8ytaa	I don't know why they told her that.  Both would be miracles.  So why did Jesus do it one way and not the other?  I can only speculate.  I could preach a sermon on it, drawing analogy and inference.  But I cannot claim to know, exegetically, the reason.  We aren't told.  Beware of assessing Christian theology based on internet answers (yes, including mine).  Not everyone who owns a bible and a computer is a theologian.<br>  <br>  peace|`|de2AwHpHaa	my understanding is magic is manipulating the energy within the living universe.  miracles are derived from outside of the temporal frame.|`|TzY9vkinaa	magic is make believe|`|8cuPVvYnaa	It seems there is an implecation of "a magic show" in your question, so I'm not sure that my answer is what you're looking for. But I'll answer anyway. A miracle of God is when we (or Jesus as a human did) ask God to do something that seems impossible and then wait for God to act, hoping and trusting in him. Magic is based on witchcraft. There is no need to submit to a higher authority in witchcraft so magic spells are their way of taking things in their own hands to try and make things happen. The first is based on reliance on God; the second is based on rebellion to God.|`|b32jC7pGaa	None. And both are illusions.

With good PR and support from the ruling groups, you have a miracle. Anything else is magic and its the ducking stool for you my dear.<br>  <br>  While converting the Irish Celts, for instance, most Christian missionaries would ascribe all kinds of magical powers to saints and the holy spirit. When the Irish church was subjugated by the Roman one these became viewed as superstitious magical nonsense and only the Roman Catholic miracles were allowed.<br>  <br>  The irony is both were made up.|`|GZUZqazcaa	Hmm!I've never thought of that,<br>  Miracles=Something from God that usually benefits more than one person and is also seen as something of glory.<br>  Magic= A selfish act done by human,sometimes harmless,other times causes harm to other people,animals,and other living things.and is Usually seen as evil or devil worship.<br>  Are you trying to say Jesus did magic lol.|`|8PjHFUdfaa	I think that if the people knew that it was magic, they might even begin to realize that they might be able to do magic too. <br>  <br>  So it is in the vested interests to keep them believing that Jesus was a "one-off" deal. <br>  <br>  That way, everyone will continue believing that there′s absolutely nothing special about themselves.|`|Pp60CVQgaa	magic is an illusion of a miracle and a miracle is genuine miracle.<br>  <br>  miracles are made from the supernatural.<br>  <br>  magic is a trick of the trade.|`|Yfv1AvScaa	a miracle is from god's blessing magic is a gift of powers I'm talking about real magic not the performed magic also it could be good or evil depend on the person who use magic.|`|jnHwmvSkaa	Magic comes from the devil, miracles come from god. <br>  <br>  I'd be willing to bet money someone seriously answers that way. <br>  <br>  In all honestly, there's no objective difference.|`|Znw52fxkaa	The difference is that Christians believe in miracles, but see magic is evil.<br>  <br>  You might like boiled eggs, whilst I like scrambled...doesn't mean they're not both eggs.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Magic is an illusion, a miracle is tangible and visible when scrutinized by anyone.|`|QbthNtevaa	Thank you, I considered asking this but then thought it wasn't worth it

The only time I look down on anyone is if they are shorter than I am and physically, it is impossible to do otherwise from my higher eye level vantage point. Being taller makes it possible for me to stand at the back of the crowd and STILL see the parade... I am grateful for the good things in my life, but at the same time, I am not envious of others who may have what THEY consider a better life than I have. I'm always surprised when I wake in the morning to find I am still breathing... surprised and PLEASED to see another day... I do not waste my time on anything as trivial and totally meaningless as envy...

9e0f3e24125eef2fce873fae44adaaa6aa	Very interesting question mate. to some extent. YES. Many are just into money making and see the church as a business instead of a sacred place of worship. There was a story 3years ago about a (black) pastor in south london with over ￡7,000,000 in his bank account refusing to pay taxes; claiming he ran a church - hence was under the charity status. So yeah. very interesting question. worth doing some more research on. & yes I am black and proud.
7gtVphhsaa	First no human has the right to judge that is up to Jesus. But it is not a natural act nor condoned in the Bible.|`|Kom3K4a8aa	All sins are forgiven by Jesus.<br>  Even Homosexuality.

4Jt0uBJMaa	I am a very spiritual guy who loves to be athletic and be outdoors. I do construction, so I am somewhat fit and very honest unlike most. As far as girls go, I like a girl who is true to herself not trying to be something she isn't. I like someone who is pretty but not bone thin, and I prefer someone who is a little intelligent. She would have to be funny and have a good sense of humor, and know how to take a joke. Ummmm I also prefer a girl who want to have a big family because that's something I've always wanted. Soo there you have it.
2840f08e64c2c66dcd455094078ea244aa	I am an educated guy for my age, love music and arts. Good with maths and phyiscs and a car lover. I wear Armani clothes, and girls tell me I'm handsome. I am a party man, and love being out with people. On the other side of the scale, Im very emotional and that gets annoying sometimes. I behave quietly and am mostly calm. Here is just a rough presentation of who I am, now my "type" of girl:<br>  <br>  Well, I do care about the image of the girl who goes out with me. Anyone who says they dont are in denial. Putting that aside, I like calm girls. I like a girl to behave like one, not going around swearing, getting drunk like her boy friends. A girl should hold her dignity and respect, no matter the situation. Then I like my girl to have secrets with me...Maybe thats wierd, but that just insures me that we belong together, somehow. I like my girl to challenge me and dont give up on anything I say. After all, she is a girl and they have their place in a relationship, I respect that. I even dont have any problem with my girl go for shopping everyday :)<br>  <br>  To summorize everything, My girl has to care about her looks, be smart but patient and be herself. In other words, a perfect lady!<br>  <br>  I treat that girl like a queen :)

So What. you meet people equally as myopic as you in the view of the world you refuse to see the world logically because religion blinds you to the reality that (for example) contraception is quite important. Positive? You help people (morally wrong to help people because of fear or consequences in the afterlife). What i'm trying to say is it's positive points are 1. Overshadowed by negatives 2. can easily be obtained.

What this man is saying convinces me, I trust his knowledge:<br>  <br>  Why did I Embrace Islam?<br>  This is an extract from Dr. Gronier, a French MP, who embraced Islam. Revealing the reason of embracing Islam he said, I read all of the Ayat (Quranic verses), which have a relation to medical, health, and natural sciences that I studied before and have a wide knowledge of. I found that these verses are totally compatible with and give a picture of our modern sciences. Thus, I embraced Islam as it was obvious that Muhammad revealed the Absolute Truth more than a thousand years ago. Had every specialist, artist or scientist compared those Quranic verses to his own specialization, beyond the shadow of doubt he would embrace Islam, especially if he has a sound mentality and goodwill to search for the truth and not a mentally defective person with the intentions of malevolent aims.<br>  Reference(s):<br>  Denier, Ateen and Sulaiman Bin Ibrahim,<br>  Muhammad Allah's Messenger.<br>  Mahmoud, Abdul-Haleem, (Dr.),<br>  Europe and Islam <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.science4islam.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.science4islam.com/</a>|`|jnHwmvSkaa	"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is pretty good.

rnbt5PEOaa	I think people like the drama of it. Notice that no one (or mostly no one) gets the facts straight. <br>  <br>  Christianity also has it's varieties of worship as well as other faiths, but some of the branches are WAY more strict than the rest. If the person was subjected to that particular branch of christians hounding him, maybe that affected him to an extreme. Of course, i tend to agree with you because even if something terrible happened to someone because of a religion good mannerisms should always be in place. <br>  <br>  I like that you said hinduism has god with different faces. My father was a baptist, my mother was some form of catholic, and one of my brothers was a wiccan so i've learned to cope with a lot of strange things and come to realize that most of the religions have the same basic belief set. <br>  <br>  Meaning, in essence, you should basicly be good and humble, not doing wrong to others. Note that there are others that reject this idea, but it seems to be among the world's leading religions. <br>  <br>  People need to stop getting caught up on religion and just live their lives well, because belief is an integral part of our society and we all need a little to get us through hard times; we should be allowed to choose our own path, after all, no matter what they'll all lead to the same place(s) regardless of what we believe.|`|yc3kuWy7aa	Because maybe religion is destroying the world, and he is trying to stop it.

It is unbiblical!|`|AA10504443	Okay, then.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Christians like yourself, though in my own experience a clear majority, tend to stay quiet and let the extremists speak for you.  To people of other faiths the Rush Limbaugh's are becoming the only spokesmen for the Christians Faith in the U.S.  We can read in the news on a weekly basis about attempts by Christians to stop medical research, to stop attempts to reduce abortions through reducing unwanted pregnancies via sex education and contraception, to undermine scientific education in public schools, even to defend and maintain laws which made observance of Christian customs compulsory and forbade all others.  That Christians do not see their words and actions in those terms I do not dispute, but that is unquestionably how many people outside your faith see it, and unless they see other Christians speaking out against that sort of thing, and they don't, it is not only understandable but entirely reasonable for them to think that this is what all Christians believe.  The vast majority of Muslims have condemned terrorist violence from it's inception, in many Middle Eastern Newspapers they do not even grant them the honorable title of "Jihadi" but refer to them as murderers, yet when was the last time you heard a Christian acknowledge that, or even speak in print with genuine respect for their history and culture?  You can't expect to gain respect by denying it to others.<br>  I would also dispute that Religion has been a cause of problems, human greed and ambition are usually the cause, religion, historically, has been an excuse rather than an actual reason, and if it hadn't been that it would have been something else.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	manyPeople like to generalize and make easily ridiculed strawmen of "them" and then tear it down<br>  <br>  Almost all the Christians I know accept modern physical sciences and its methods and evidences|`|QpUhZHj7aa	I won't say you're self-righteous, But anti-science does go with the territory. the bible & science don't mix.

God is not pleased with you.<br>  <br>  “YOU heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not murder; but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.’ 22  However, I say to YOU that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; but whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Ge·hen′na.<br>  <br>  23 “If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and you there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away; first make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have come back, offer up your gift. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible teaches us Anger is not in our best interest...and to avoid it.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 14:29; 29:11 "He that is slow to anger is abundant in discernment, but one that is impatient is exalting foolishness. All his spirit is what a stupid one lets out, but he that is wise keeps it calm to the last."<br>  <br>  ***Ephesians 4:26 "Be wrathful, and yet do not sin; let the sun not set with you in a provoked state."***<br>  <br>  Frank Donovan, in his book Dealing With Anger—Self-Help Solutions for Men, recommends: "Escaping anger—or, more specifically, escaping the scene and other people in your angry episode—is a strategy which has special importance and value at the higher levels of anger."<br>  <br>  Proverbs 17:14 "The beginning of contention is as one letting out waters; so before the quarrel has burst forth, take your leave."<br>  <br>  Bertram Rothschild, writing in the journal The Humanist, states: "Anger . . . is primarily one's personal responsibility. The reasons to become angry exist in our heads. . . . The few times anger worked for you pale in comparison to the multitude of times it made things worse. It is far better not to produce the anger than to experience it."<br>  <br>  Psalm 37:8 "Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil."<br>  <br>  Proverbs 15:1 "An answer, when mild, turns away rage, but a word causing pain makes anger to come up."<br>  <br>  Proverbs 29:22 "A man given to anger stirs up contention, and anyone disposed to rage has many a transgression."<br>  <br>  IMHO those who don't heed this advice will learn the hard way.<br>  <br>  More  Bible verses on the importance of Apologizing.<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20021101/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20021101/art...</a>
yhfG07Jtaa	Sorry, you're wrong. It's racist to suggest that blacks are the best athletes. It was racist when your grandmother said "they're half monkey" and it's racist today.<br>  It is not OK to suggest that blacks are the best athletes. The most-televised sports may be dominated by blacks, but it's not even proved that the sports on television are the truest test of athleticism.<br>  Come to think of it, my terrier is a better athlete than lots of linebackers.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	What do you mean rely on intelligence and fundamentals, You need to come to long beach poly where i played quarterback and i was the offensive leader calling plays, we were rank #6 in the nation in high school, go to usatoday/high school football and look at the rankings..

Anything to say white people are good at something (unless it's something stupid like murder, destroying, ect), it's racist. If you look at statistics, white people are probably the most successful race in world history and the only race present as main roles in all 6 continents. Spaniards/Portuguese colonized South America and Latin America, British colonized America and Australia, Portuguese influenced Japan enough to change their language and religion, and of course the Middle Easter, Northern Africa and Europe are all main white places that have prospered as superpowers for thousands of centuries. The next would probaby be Eastern Asian because they've contributed a lot but they didn't control as many areas as whites.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	well, okay,<br>  i wouldn't say it's racist. but you'd still have to give me logical reason as to why, like you did as in the blacks are the best athletes.<br>  i wouldn't say all whites are smarter, but they learn easily.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Yeah.

Asians are actually smarter.<br>  <br>  As to the actual subject matter.  Undeniably asians are smarter, blacks are better at sports, whites are (insert something) ... and the technical definition of racism is applicable, but this leads to a slippery slope of racist belief which will impede other people.

In my opinion, anything can exist if one believes in its existence. I do not believe in a single "god." But I do not contest said "god's" existence because others believe in him.

Only when the child finds the actual truth for himself does the "monsters" vanish. But how can one prove there never was any monster? Is this child delusional, or are his beliefs real? There are many mysteries to life. You believe in a God you cannot see. How does that differ from the man who believes  in a pink unicorn YOU cannot see? Who are we to ridicule what we cannot understand? Does my disbelief in your God make him NOT exist to you? Of course not.

KBBonf97aa	Becoming aroused over something random has no bearing on your sexual orientation.  If you've always been attracted to girls, you're probably completely straight.  Most guys who identify as bisexual eventually come out of the closet as gay, but find it safer (both physically and emotionally) to keep the option of dating girls on the table at least until they're out of school.  And if you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll also find that virtually all the girls who identified as bisexual during school grew up to be happily heterosexual.  Some of them "dabble" in same-sex relationships because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions during adolescence are normal, but also temporary.  They have everything to do with elevated hormone levels and nothing to do with sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure about your sexual orientation, there's nothing you can do to figure out what it is except be patient.  Experimentation won't give you any concrete answers, since any human being can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, but it has nothing to do with orientation.  It's just biology.  Sexual orientation always sorts itself out over time, so there's no reason to stick yourself with a label that might not apply to you for very long.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you're meant to be.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	I think unfortunate... engorgement can occur at pretty much random times regardless of attraction or arousal.

Some smokers are very polite and courteous about how they smoke and would respond to that. But if they won't change or start trying to make it worse....<br>  <br>  Then I would tell your landlord. Because I grew up across the street from the man who I later rented from, and I payed my rent on time and no one ever complained about me, he would take care of me. When he had a problem renter, such as someone who is going to destroy one of his apartments by stinking it up, and possibly putting burns in the carpets, etc, then he would raise their rent until they couldn't afford to pay it so that they would leave.  Lease's usually expire in one year, so if they are close to the end of their year, he could have them out pretty fast and rent to someone who's safer to rent to and someone who won't make all the other tenants want to leave.|`|WI8qeyJmaa	you'd have to confront them but you have to without any expectations...suggest they run a high speed fan in the window to exhaust the smoke further away from the building.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	The landlord has nothing to do with it, unless someone is breaking the terms of the lease.

Don't generalize every American.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	911.|`|MSWgVj4Maa	Mostly the whole wanting to kill us labeling us satan and dogs etc. kind of puts the brakes on happy time.|`|FVkq5RRZaa	well you should see how Christians are treated in the Islamic world.|`|1eFitXh9aa	Because when I look with the text of the Qu'Ran and find multiple passages the slaughter, abuse, segregation, mutilation, degradation of every man woman and child that does not believe in Mohammed's teaching I see it as a declaration of terror!|`|0puMsQJgaa	Dear A,<br>  <br>  Good Question, Here is Your ANSWER!<br>  <br>  Most Westerners are Intelligent People.

BSt7ji9Xaa	WHy do people like to group a whole race of people together and "assume" they all think and act the same cause they are that race?? that's basically what your question is asking if "asian and hispanic guys" like black girls.. u do know there not all the same just cause they happen to be of that race? if there american or canadian chances are they would date a black girl given the chance.. im a white american man currently dating a black girl im sure you probably would classify me and say "Do white guys find black girls attractive I never seen one that does" well im white and here I am.. i find black girls attractive, just cause im white doesn't mean i act and think the same as every other white guy walking around.. im my own person and i certainly don't form my opinions or ideas in "groups" lol.. <br>  <br>  your question is ridiculous just like the person asking it.<br>  <br>  IF your hot i dont care what color you are I WILL date you.. lol. THere are plenty of hot girls in every race.. ive seen them with my own eyes.. so they do exist. Ive also seen plenty of ugly in every race so that can be said as well.<br>  <br>  dude you need to get out more though cause u lacking diversity..|`|7GL815olaa	I have to say Black girls are the most beautiful girls in this world. for me they are amazingly beautiful. they have a body to die for and to be honest it is hard to find such a boody in any other race. my family think most of black pll talk crap about others but I know my family are being so ******* racist because I have a lot of black friends n they aint all the same. one thing I don like about em is that they are so fuking loud. black guls are beautiful and they can dance better than any one else. uhhhh when they shake that booty huuuuuuu haha. They have an amazing body and they have the power to get men do anyt hing. nways I don have a black gf but I wish I did|`|Qm8dM8wsaa	In Jamacia there are a lof of asian jamacians. Hispanics are mixed with black. A whole bunch of them. It varies for different people. Go on youtube and search what you asked there's videos.|`|Eb0VXXUjaa	I really don't know, I see some Asian men go out with a black women. It varies.|`|wuOINS7eaa	I dont think they like Black girls at all.|`|osxUWAylaa	There are dark skin Asians and Latinos so what does that tell you?|`|daZS4jNGaa	there are numerous hispanic/black couples. however, i have never seen an asian with a black person in the US but in the caribbean especially jamaica its a very popular mix.|`|OTnSwNwZaa	Asian and hispanic societies generally wish to be accepted by whites. <br>  <br>  Asian cultures have never viewed dark skin as desirable, so very few asians will ever date Blacks (especially asian men with Black women). <br>  <br>  Hispanics might give a Black woman more of a chance since some hispanics have African admixture and some might be more into the stereotypical media Black culture.|`|GZUZqazcaa	Mei,you make it sound like Black Women are unclassy?Do you have some deep rooted issue with black people because a lot of your questions sound hateful towards us.Sorry if i'm wrong.But you're right about the part of asian parents not liking their children to marry blacks.My grandmother's side of the family hates her because she's Okinawan-Black..sad really.<br>  <br>  Anyway,i've seen a heck a lot of Black women-asian men together when I went to NYC last summer for vacation.:)The guy I am currently dating's mom is from the Carribean(she's black)and his father is Chinese.<br>  <br>  I can't really say what HIspanic Guys and Asian guys think of us because it would be a biased answer because we can't ask everysingle asian and hispanic in the world what they think XD and people are diffrent.|`|C9QQPROkaa	I rarely see asian guys and black women, But there are a sh**load of hispanic men and black women together lol.<br>  <br>  edit: LOL@ hett|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	I like black girls I wanna lick|`|CZw2Gpbraa	both of my brothers (we are hispanic) are dating black girls
