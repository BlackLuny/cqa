AA11388887	Well from the fact of what you said that she hasn't seen him since she was 8 months old she is only afraid of him because of things YOU have told her which he can change to make it look like you have turn his own daughter on him.  Stick to the facts.  I was given the choice when I was 8 years old to see my dad and I was also told I could not be left alone with him, that alone scared me into telling my grandmother no!  Leave your daughter's fear out of it completely.  I have been on both sides of custody issues, I have never met my father who has been in and out of jail for drugs as well.  He is currently in jail I just finished telling my mom that at 23 I am going to contact him so I can get to know that side of the family, she wasn't happy with it either!  I have also been on the father's side, my fiance has two kids from a previous marriage that he only gets to see 3 times a year thanks to his evil ex wife!  I just say stick to the facts, he has been in and out of jail for drugs and for attacking your husband and that he didn't even show up for his supervised visits.  Don't mention child support (if he doesn't pay) and don't mention your daughter's fears because just from what you have said they are "unfounded", that might be the wrong word, but you said it is been over 7 years since he has seen her so she has no memory of him at all except what you have told her.  Also in the process of canceling his visitation rights you might as well find out how to file a petition to to sever his parental rights.  Even though he sounds like an awful man it is only fair to him as well, why should he have to pay for a child he never gets to see so his parental rights should be severed and then you won't have to worry about him ever again.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I would hope that all that is enough to make the courts keep him away but I have seen a few cases lately that have blown my mind.  Just make sure that you bring all the evidence you have about this stuff.  My question though: why not just give up on child support.  Is the money worth the fact that he may now or at some time in the furture get visitation with her?  I never went after my sons bio father for child support for that reason alone.  I am in no way judging you, just wanted to bring that up as an option.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Honey, believe me I know how you feel about the child support issue.  I wasnt trying to be mean but was just offering another route.  I wish we could tell you that if you went to court for support that the judge would look at his horrible past and not allow him to have any visitation, but we can't.  Our justice system is messed up in that regards and stranger things have happened.
e6L94fX9aa	I would think your boss would let you go to part-time what kind of work do you do and where do you live.  you can learn to cut back , i have learned so  ways to do that. I take all of the adds in the sunday paper with me to wal-mart and if some one has a better deal Wilmar will honor that price. I saved almost $80.00  on my trip yesterday and i also use coupons . hope this helps would love to hear form you on how things come about take care and good luck|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I can't answer your families financial questions, but I do know that when I went from full to part time, we saved lots of money just by having me at home. I clip coupons, drive less, we rarely eat out, I budget better because I have the time, etc. I have the time to research the best price and shop around. I also save by not having to pitch in for people's birthdays, special lunches, retirement parties, baby/wedding showers etc at work. It can be done, depending upon your bills etc. I would be concerned about your time with your husband...working opposite days is hard on a marriage...but I support you 100% in making a change. You know when you cannot go on anymore, and clearly you are there. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  As far as your Dr getting involved, I do not know that I would go that route personally.

hmOidFp3aa	A line, is a line, is a line!<br>  CONGRATS ON YOUR BFP you are def preggo. Tomorrow morning before you pee go buy another test and the line should be darker! Call an OB and get in for your first check up! <br>  I didnt have anysyptoms except for a soft cervix (it hardens up before your period)<br>  and extreme exhaustion! Keep me posted :)
AZSIoSNoaa	I never figured out anything on how to help them, other than a snug cotton bra. sorry. Good luck, and God Bless|`|I6KsujGpaa	You shouldn't have gotten pregnant then you wouldn't have achy breasts.|`|G8lGIytPaa	the best thing to do is to make sure you are wearing a supportive bra. after that take warm baths to relax and a heat pack if thats not possible. sore breast are very common. I used sports bras the traditional bras cut in to me to much. at the end of my pregnancy i was wearing two sports bras and a tank top. good luck! congrats on being a new mommy
OfLyP6mgaa	Yes. You can take cold medicine too, if you want. I took my son to the doctor today because he was sick, and I asked his Pediatrician what I could take since I got the cold also. He said you can pretty much take whatever cold medicine you like, as VERY little passes through the breastmilk. He said the medications that say "not recommended when breastfeeding" only say that because VERY RARELY and infant will not respond well to it (i.e., be drowsy, fussy, etc), but that the majority of babies will tolerate the medicine perfectly. Take what you need to so that you feel better and can take good care of your baby :) Hope you feel better.|`|ngkNaQJeaa	i was told, the minamal medicine the better, you should try to take hot baths, and drink non caffinated tea first before going to the medicine cabinet.<br>  way to go! (for breastfeeding your little one)|`|CJkrXeDgaa	Is it just Tylenol pain relief or Tylenol cold and sinus?  Check the box...cold medicines (even Tylenol) are not recommended while breast feeding.|`|h3Ed9qm9aa	You can take paracetamol.|`|0865c6ad7ceb4eecee2cc06248e0f7d4aa	Yeah sure you can. The only thing you may be worried of is an antibiotic. Take care!|`|EyKJ737daa	Most definitely sweetie, sorry to hear you aren't well.  Definitely not fun for mum when she's nursing a baby and a head cold!  Paracetamol/tylenol is definitely safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Be sure not to go over the recommended dose in a 24 hour period though as I'm sure you already know.  Try putting some vicks vapour rub on the colour of your clothes.  It should help with keeping your nose clear and help you to breath a bit easier.  Having it on your clothes wont hurt baby either and will probably help baby keep a clear head too during feeding.  If your throat gets sore, at the first sign of it, gargle some warm salty water every 20-30 mins for the first few hours then every couple of hours there after for a day and your sore throat should go.  I know this probably sounds silly to most too but when you are sitting breastfeeding bub, bring your foot up on your other knee and so you can reach the bottom of your foot and give it a good but gentle massage around the balls of your foot and around the each toe.  Best to do the right foot when baby is nursing on right side and visa versa with the left. Unless you find something more comfortable.  Massaging your feet is called reflexology and it is very effective and will help with any ailments you have throughout your body.  Massage them as often as you breastfeed and that will help relieve congestion on your chest and head too.  good luck sweetie and I do hope you feel better sooner rather than later xx|`|MeYILJeSaa	Yes. Tylenol is fine when pregnant, so it's fine when nursing. <br>  Get well!
MXXOICquaa	they can engage anywhere for 4 to 6 weeks before labor begins sorry im sure its not the answer you were looking for but good luck and maybe it is coming soon|`|1IDSGM71aa	My daughter was engaged at like 30 or 32 weeks. I had her at like 37 weeks, so she was full term. I don't think it's an indicator of early labor, but you should talk with your doctor about it soon if it worries you at all.|`|REotVciZaa	real smart baby?  have fun!!!  ;)|`|AZSIoSNoaa	As your baby grows towards the end of pregnancy, the shape of your uterus, your liver and intestines encourage your baby's presenting part (usually head, but sometimes bottom) to dip down into the pelvic cavity. This can occur as early as 33 or 34 weeks, but may not happen before labour starts. If the baby engages in the pelvis early this does not mean that you will give birth early. Usually the baby will engage in the pelvis by 37 to 38 weeks, but this process can also be affected by lots of other things: <br>  <br>  ? If you are very sporty and have well-toned abdominal muscles this may mean that your tummy is held in tighter, which changes the angle of the baby's body and presenting part to the pelvic brim. In this position it is harder for your baby to engage in the pelvis. To encourage your baby's head to engage you need to relax your tummy muscles and "dangle your belly" out at the front. <br>  <br>  ? If you spend a lot of time sitting down at work, in a car, or in soft easy chairs to watch TV, your baby is likely to be lying in a posterior position - that is with its back to your back. In this position it is harder for your baby to enter your pelvis. This baby position is not the best position for an efficient labour, partly because the presenting part remains high for so long. Take care to sit leaning forward whenever you sit down, with your knees below your hips, which will help your baby turn its back towards your front and to move down. A kneeling chair is ideal for this. <br>  <br>  ? If you have had several babies before, your tummy muscles may be loose, which makes it easy for the baby to move and change position a lot. Sometimes your baby may not lie up and down (longitudinal), but across your tummy (transverse) or at an angle (oblique). Positions like these make it less likely that your baby will engage in the pelvis before the start of labour. <br>  <br>  ? Your baby may be a large one, in which case it may not descend into the pelvis until contractions start. <br>  <br>  ? The shape of your pelvis may also be relevant. Sometimes the pelvic inlet is narrow. In these cases it may take a long time for the baby's presenting part to enter the pelvis, but once it is in, birth is usually rapid, because the pelvic outlet in these cases tends to be roomy.
e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	The last trimester is the longesssst couple months of your life.  Have you found out the baby's sex?  If not, once you do you can occupy your time by getting things ready, start a scrapbook or memory book.  Try some new things like taking a pottery class or something you may not have time for when the baby is born.  Once you have the baby, your pregnancy will seem like it flew by but until then, I am sorry to say that it will feel like you have been pregnant forever.  I used to tell people that I had the longest pregnancy in history with my third :)  Sometimes your belly changes shape or the baby moves to another spot that may make you look more pregnant or less pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, honey.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just saw your note about bed rest.  That will probably make things worse.  Try reading, or taking up painting or like I said doing scrapbooks.  I got my second sons scrapbook all made except pictures before he was born.  I knew I wouldn't have time to do when he was first born and it made keeping it up to date easier.|`|giRRCXU4aa	I can remember very clearly the day I found out I was pregnant and thinking, "this is going to take FOREVER!" Now i'm at the end and it feels like it's flown by. You just have to keep yourself busy, unless you can't for some reason and then I guess it would seem like it's taking forever.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	It's normal to feel eager to see the baby and get on with raising them, it's exciting and perfectly normal.. Usually when it's your first pregnancy, the baby bulge tend to look smaller, but to be honest if it's you in the photo, then i'd definitely think you're 18 weeks or even 22, because it does look significantly big to me!|`|ksWm9eCBaa	You're lucky that you can already feel the baby move; some don't feel it till 20 weeks or more!  Get conscious of all the changes in your body, re: "looked preg @ 14 wks, not @18"...is your weight gain maybe a bit more "all over"?  Face, arms, etc?  Maybe that's it, the weight gain is more "all over" than centered in your bump?  And, bless you on the bed rest issue!  I know that's so difficult!  Hopefully, you like to read?  (TV gets sooooooo boring, as if you weren't already bored!)  Hey: get someone to bring you the Twilight anthology...and you can read yourself into Vampire Land for at least a few days...be something different to take your mind off!  (It's not my genre and I was amazed how compelling that series was??)  Maybe there's something you could do from your laptop to help with a local charity?  Be at the top rung of Yahoo!Answers by Labor Day!  Anything to help you get thru this...at least you'll have a lil miracle at the end of your journey.  Best to you!|`|hlztyMYyaa	actually you still have 5 and a half months left  22 weeks , with my first pregnancy I did not show until I was 7 months pregnant but believe me it will happen soon and don't worry you have plenty of time to enjoy him after birth so just enjoy being pregnant cause when its over you will miss it lots!!!!!!!!!!|`|CxJFfSeiaa	It does seem like it takes forever, but as soon as you have your little one it will seem like it was only a eek you were pregnant! dont rush things! enjoy being pregnant while you can! believe me you will miss it like crazy when you have the baby! i do!|`|woEoXfaZaa	I know how you feel cause I was the same way with my first.  Btu after about 2 weeks in my sleep deprived state I was think "can't they put him back in!!!!!"<br>  <br>  After baby is out you will look back and think - that was quick but for the moment the next 4 months will feel like forever and the last month will feel like even long cause you will be so big and uncomfortable - sorry no good news!!<br>  <br>  The only good news is it will be worth it when you hold that baby in your arms for the first time.|`|MetVwIYPaa	Just enjoy having your baby all to yourself 24-7!! I was in such a hurry for it to be over with and now even though I ABSOLUTELY LOVE having my little princess here and wouldn't change it for the world...I miss being pregnant..ALOT actually...
si770wyhaa	My best suggestion is to wait and make sure. They thought for sure I had miscarried, but turns out I'd only lost one [I was pregnant with twins, but we didn't know it till I lost one at 4 weeks or so] but luckily they were able to find the secnod one. I would make sure you aren't pregnant before you take those pills. Even with the blood test tho, some women don't show up until a few weeks, you're correct. I'd say if the test tomorrow is negitive, maybe insist on a scan? That's what I did. My blood test was all screwed up, so I told them I wanted another ultrasound to make completely sure. They did one and turns out there was a healthy, small but healthy, little one in there. And I was only about 4 or 5 weeks pregnant. I was like two weeks late for my period at that time too. And still my blood test results were funky. They didn't seem like somoene who was pregnant. lol. ANyway good luck, and if you did miscarry, just relax and try again. It will happen when it's meant to. Hope this helps.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	personally, if you haven't bled, I wouldn't take that pill. Thats my opinion though, are you far enough along to see a heart beat yet? Make them do an ultrasound to confirm before chancing killing the baby if its still alive. just my opinion though. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|m2dLOQl8aa	Demand an ultrasound. And then maybe also from another doctor. The first one may just breeze through it to get you out of there and keep you from getting excited, and not even notice the little teeny tiny heartbeat. Don't take the pills until YOU are positive that there's nothing growing anymore.
Jf3DIPcNaa	the stretching is only temporary. An extra stitch is not only unnecessary, but wouldn't work. It would just tear right out. Stitches don't work that way. That's just a myth created by stupid men. <br>  <br>  Do your kegals and you will be fine. Yes, for a few months it may feel a little looser, but it will go back to normal. I had twins, then a 9.5 pound baby also, all vaginally, and I've never had a problem with my area down there not being tight enough.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	I can't answer that from personal experience, yet, (my hubby says he plans to ask them to put in an extra) but all my guy friends that are daddys said it makes a BIG difference, in a good way. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|AA11089301	hahah let them stick a needle in your cooch and see if you want extra....it doesn't really stretch any more than before if you do you keegle exercises......look them up if you dont know what they are.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Stitches only assist in reconnecting damaged tissue.  If you got an extra stitch to push undamaged skin together, it would be like pressing your thumb to your arm and leaving it sit for 4 weeks.  It wouldn't be joined even after four weeks.  I have never ever heard of this.
LDiBjNf5aa	Why are you asking questions about an abortion when you don't even know if you're pregnant, and doubt that you are? Cross that bridge when you come to it, and if you do, don't ask here - most people will jump down your throat for it and not give any factual information.<br>  <br>  Keep waiting. Ask your chiropracter if the work could affect your cycle, or if you don't want to ask him/her, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss it. Figuring it out is far more relaxing than stressing about it. Good luck!|`|dRmuYQcPaa	im in the same boat my period started feb 1 and its march 10th. i do know illness and stress can delay your period or make you miss it all together. last august, i missed mine all together i didnt think i was stressed but i did just lose my job and thats probably why i missed it. i was researching pregnancy signs just before i saw ur question and i have a few symptoms, sore boobs, sleepiness but sometimes that can just be pms. i say wait a week or so then take a test but sometimes u cant wait but i say try not to think about it and do other things to take ur mind off it then test urself if u still havent gotten it. if i am pregos then my fear of infertility can be thrown out the window, whew! but then whats the next step?

sxZk6njLaa	In America I hear everyone is circumsized, but I've no idea why.<br>  <br>  One of the so-called pros is that it's "cleaner". This is a myth; it's actually just easier/quicker to clean. If a boy/man can be bothered to clean himself properly then there really is no difference.<br>  <br>  In my honest opinion, it's unnecessary mutilation.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	Just pros, no cons. Peace!|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Some insurance pays and some do not because they view it as a cosmetic procedure.  Just call and ask them.<br>  <br>  I have been on the fence about this subject for a while since we are ttc and I saw how a circumsion is done (strapping newborn baby onto a board and just cutting the skin off while baby screams out).  Well I asked my Aunt who is a doctor that delivers babies recently.  She said she still does circumsions but she asks that the parents think it over and make sure they really want to do it.  She said there is absolutely no medical evidence to support it being done.  She also told me had she known what she does now that she wouldn't have had her own son done years ago.  She said that as long as the parents clean the penis well and teach the child too then there is no issue.  It doesn't put a man at risk for STD's but that unprotected sex in general does.  She said a baby girl has many creases and such that have to be properly cleaned by parents and then taught to the girl as she grows so there is no difference.  If a baby girl was to have excess skin removed from her genitals (which is done she said in some countries) it is seen as genital mutilation.  What is the difference?  She told me that primarily the only benefit is cosmetic appearance.  To be the same as the baby's father.  And also religious beliefs.  She said there are a few cons those being...it is surgery and there are always risks with infection and delayed healing, sometimes the skin reattaches itself during the healing process and creates issues and has to be redone (this has happened to my cousin's baby now he has to have it repeated when he is 2), possible nerve damage (especially if the doctor isn't good and how do you know if they are), and she said there is some evidence of potty training issues with circumsized little boys.  She said it isn't proven yet but that they believe it has something to do with the nerve endings.<br>  <br>  She told me that she tells all parents having little boys to think about it and if they have any doubt don't do it because it can't be undone but it can be done later in life.  She said yes they will remember it being done if they are older but we don't take every newborns tonsils or appendix's out (there is no real known function of these) just because it could cause a problem later in life and they won't remember it as a baby.  So she views it the same way.  She said she is seeing less and less baby boys getting it done.  <br>  <br>  I am still on the fence about the subject if we ever have a boy but she gave me some real information.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|EPaYoJaiaa	It is neither good nor bad to do it. It used to be done for cleanliness reasons (after religous reasons) but it's been since then found that it is no more hygenic than not being circumsized. There are still people today that think it's more hygenic but it's really not. My ex-boyfriend and my nephew are both uncircumsized and neither have had ANY problems with it. There is no medical reason to circumsize. Some people will have it done because the father is circumsized and they think it will be easier come potty training time and they'll be just like daddy. Others do it because they think a majority of other boys have theirs circumsized and they don't want their boy to be made fun of by others. Supposedly if you get it circumsized it will decrease sensitivity but I don't really know if that's true or not.<br>  It's really just a plain ole decision for the parents to make. But like I said there's no medical reason to circumsize, there's no medical reason to not circumsize either.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	pros: <br>  <br>  you don't have to give that area any special care after it is all healed<br>  <br>  you don't have to worry and wonder if your boy is taking proper care of his area himself<br>  <br>  you greatly reduce his risk of infection and need for a circ later on when he's remember it and when it would be more painful<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  <br>  none in my eyes other than that is not the way god wanted boys to be....but medical science found a way to make things easier so why not take advantage? <br>  <br>  Most insurances cover it..call yours and ask. <br>  <br>  Let me offer some advice you... if you do plan on doing this have on hand at home some Vaseline and gauze pads because you will need those for the healing circ.. we did not and my hubby had to run out as soon as we were home to get some when I ran out of what the hospital gave me. <br>  <br>  It is not bad for your baby..it's normal and done all the time.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hmmmmmm has the right idea...your son should be whatever your partner is.|`|7kosr9mcaa	1. They can screw it up and then your poor baby will either be deformed or have to go through more torture to fix it<br>  2. Babies will disassociate from their body (like a person who is being abused) and can possibly go into shock as a result from the pain. This disassociation can lead to multiple personality disorder or other mental illness.<br>  3.For religious reasons...would you force your religion on another person? NO! So why should being circumsized be your choice? He can decide when he is older.<br>  4."He should look like his dad" BS!!! A young boy is not going to understand. You will just tell him everyone is different thats why he doesn't look like mommy or sissy either. And what teenage boy compares his penis with his fathers?<br>  5."He might be made fun of when he is older" It is your responsibility to teach your child positive body image anyways.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It's not a good idea. Here's a really helpful link with FAQs: <a href="http://oknocirc.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://oknocirc.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Basically the benefits are either minor or have never been proven.

They can get infections and things if it's not cleaned right.  My cousin who is now 24, got circumcised 3 years ago & was in ssssssoooooo much pain.  My best friends dad got his done at 50.  Alot of pain there too.  Yea, the baby may cry for a few seconds while it's being done, but it's done and over with.

It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the enis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis....<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...|`|J4z3mJyuaa	Pros - Small decrease in risk of infections, such as UTIs.<br>            Some recent studies have shown a lowered risk in the transfer of  HIV.<br>  <br>  Cons - Small chance of complications resulting from the procedure.<br>             No longer deemed necessary in the U.S. (or any other health organization in the world), so many insurance policies (including Medicaid) won't cover the cost.<br>  <br>  Both cut and uncut males have a small chance of complications. Very rarely, a circumcision may be necessary to treat a condition, but it is recommended by doctors far more often than is necessary. Hospitals make big bucks off of the procedure and much more for selling the foreskins. <br>  The foreskin has many functions, especially for sexual intercourse. (Gross to think about, I know, but it will be very important to your child when he is older.) It is not a "useless piece of flesh" as many people believe. You can have a perfectly healthy and satisfying life without it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't serve any function.<br>  <br>  Everything else I can think of is just preference/opinion. Personally, I didn't have it done because it made me feel bad to even consider it. I'm not saying anyone is a bad parent for doing it. I just went with my own instinct. The glans (head) is supposed to be an internal membrane and kept wet. After years of being circumcised, the tissue hardens and dries out and it seems logical that it would become less sensitive over time. This was before I heard of lower chance of HIV, and I'm not sure of all the details of that. It might be worth looking into. Or it might just be another excuse that doctors came up with to continue doing it. Doctors change their "facts" all of the time. It was sometimes necessary centuries ago, because people weren't able to bathe regularly or for those who lived in the desert (sand under foreskin = pain). It's since been done for religion, differentiating tribes, racism, prevention of masturbation or sexual promiscuity, prevention of cancer, etc. Remember when they proved that milk causes cancer? They also used to say that the smegma (natural oils that lubricate the glans beneath the foreskin) caused cancer. It's hard to know what to believe and it shouldn't be an easy decision for those of us who put any real thought into it.<br>  Contrary to popular belief, keeping a baby's uncircumcised penis clean is no more difficult than a circumcised one. You wash them the same way. The foreskin should not be pulled back until the child discovers that it can easily be moved on his own.  Never, ever force it!  Trying to force it back will cause pain and can lead to infection. It is meant to remain intact until they are older, and keep the glans moist and clear of infection. An uncircumcised child should have no problem keeping themselves clean daily with a mild soap. I know uncircumcised men (including my older brother) who have never had any infection or societal problems at all.<br>  If you live in the U.S., most men are circumcised, so there are a lot of myths about the uncircumcised penis. The number of circumcised babies are decreasing, though. I suggest searching for factual information about the procedure, and then going to both Anti- and Pro-Circumcision forums. If you only look at sites that are against circumcision, you won't get all of the information and advice that you need to make the decision and vice-versa. The sites are going to heavily push whichever view they have.<br>  I'm not trying to convince you not to circumcise. I just noticed when I was trying to make the decision that those who are against it are greatly outnumbered. Many people in the U.S. just instantly say "do it!" and aren't even aware of both sides of the debate. They only mention what they have heard from other people who advocate circumcision. I think it's important for parents to be able to make an informed decision. <br>  <br>  Women who say they are/look gross are just used to seeing circumcised males and people tend to prefer what they are exposed to.<br>  Your child will not be made fun of in the locker room. Boys have strict rules about looking at each other's "equipment" and would be promptly made fun of for mentioning it.<br>  Your child will not feel bad for not "looking like Daddy". He may be curious, but that's about it. By the time he's old enough to care, he probably won't be seeing Daddy's penis anyway. Besides, penises don't look the same.<br>  Most uncut penises look nearly the same as a circumcised penis when fully erect.<br>  That stuff under the foreskin (smegma) serves many functions and only stinks if it is allowed to accumulate. Teaching your child to wash properly will solve this problem. It takes very little effort.<br>  Yes, he is more likely to get a UTI, but women get them all the time and come out of it just fine. It's not a big deal, unless you don't take care of yourself and treat any UTI at the first signs.<br>  <br>  I let my husband make the final decision, since I don't have a penis and all, but gave him a lot of things to read|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with.

These concerns will not effect the child until he is older.<br>  <br>  B) There are some small medical studies that link penial cancer with uncircumcised males. The study rates show about an 8% chance per 10,000 uncircumcised males. Further research is needed in this area and the sample sizes are probably a little small.<br>  <br>  C) As parents you need to be aware that you can contribute to problems later in the boys life if you attempt to "unpeel" the skin folds around the glans before the child is old enough to have this occur naturally. Just leave them alone and everything will be fine.<br>  <br>  D) Remember if your son feels strongly about it or has medical concerns it is a procedure which can be done later in life with no adverse effects.<br>  <br>  If you feel strongly about it then go ahead, as it will avoid several of the items mentioned above.|`|Iyc5vrEcaa	Please don't do this to your son.

Most of these are Muslim.<br>  <br>  Non-religious circumcision began in the late 1800's to stop boys from masturbating among other silly reasons.  This only happened in English speaking countries.  Most countries have never circumcised.  Circumcision was never that popular in Britain and had died out by 1950.  Today less than 1% of British boys are circumcised.  In Canada and Australia it died out in the 1970's.  Today less than 10% of boys are circumcised in these 2 countries.  The USA is the only place it is really done.

With an intact boy, all you need to know is do not pull the foreskin back or try to clean under it.  This incorrect advice is often given by inexperienced doctors.  The foreskin is attached to the glans (head of penis, underneath the foreskin) at birth.  It should be left to separate naturally.  Once separated, the boy can pull the foreskin back.  This separation usually occurs from the ages of 0-10 , though it can occur in puberty.  Until it becomes retractable - there is no care.  After it becomes retractable then there is no danger - just tell your boy to wash under it in the shower like any other body part.  It takes 2 seconds.  here is full guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  Circumcised boys need a lot more care.

Then you have to worry about the skin re-attaching.  You also have an open wound to contend with.  Studies also say that because of the pain and stress of the operation, the boy experiences post-traumatic stress.  This can affect the bond you have with him as well as breast feeding.<br>  <br>  Let's us not forget also that the foreskin has a function.  It is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin also has a role in sex.

That's ridiculous...if that was me...I would ask my mom to go somewhere else if she doesn't give a sh*t about her own granddaughter's health. Second hand smoke has been proved to kill babies.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	is anyone home with her during the day? Set up a video camera and catch her in the act..<br>  Tell her if she does not respect you, your home and your rules, she can find somewhere else to live.|`|IPfHpkUwaa	This goes way beyond her not thinking of the baby's health here. This is total disrespect for you and your mate!...In Your house. I do not believe there is a way to put it nicely to her. Tell her she either follows your rules in your house of she can pack her bags and get out! If she does it again,pack her bags for her and toss them outside! I have dealt with something similar with My ex-mother in law. There is no other way,but to exercise "tuff love" and restore authority in your home!  Your doctor has hand outs about smoking with infants around. Get some hand them to her,tell her read them now and we will talk in an hour. Make no mistake this is a multi-fold problem and you need to deal with it decisively and promptly. Take it from someone that has gone through a tough time with an in law...get busy and bring peace and health to your home. In the end , it is you ,your mate and your children...not all of you and the mother in law. She is NOT part of the equation...|`|EDiJe38Taa	Your house, your rules. Tell her you will have to ask her to leave if she doesn't care about the health of your baby as much as you do.
T7KKdIU0aa	I would assume (although I'm no doctor) that low hcg levels are hereditary.  BUT...remember that EVERY person is different, EVERY pregnancy is different.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No, they're not hereditary. It just depends on your body and your own hormones.
nQ7ZcUI3aa	Use her initials like Isabelle Jane or Isla Jeanne, or findout what Ingrid means and find another name with the same meaning, we also have both lost our dads, and so I understand in this problem. I like the name Alaina because it is the female version of Allen which was his middle name.|`|UJHKyg7kaa	David Riley<br>  David Jacob<br>  David Ryan<br>  David Joseph<br>  <br>  Darid Joseph (Ingrid and David together!)

VwMkiLFPaa	I’ve always been raised to believe if you work hard, you achieve great things. That hard work will always pay off. I had a summer job at 14 yrs old. Worked 2 jobs in the summer when I was 16 yrs old. It teaches more than just about “hard work”. And I plan on raising my son to do the same!|`|TQW5E6olaa	Oh yeah, everywhere I look I see people who believe they're entitled to something. <br>  <br>  I'm hoping to raise my daughter with a good work ethic and that in order to get anything in life, you have to be willing to work for it, nothing should be handed over simply because someone wants it.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Some people are just spoiled. We have real problems and it's not always possible for everyone to take care of themselves. It's real. I definitely think that it might possibly be exaggerated or fully taken advantage of. One person says that. <br>  <br>  Kids today have it made. Parents just throw stuff at them. They don't have to work for anything. They are really lazy, some of them. It drives me crazy - try to make it easy for them and when you do ask something of them - can't do that little thing. I want to smack them but never would. It would not do any good. So I just leave them be - they will learn the hard way or not have a good character. <br>  <br>  In a perfect world - I agree with you but we do not live in a perfect world.<br>  <br>  I value honesty!!!  I value the truth. I hate cheaters and liars. They steal from the rest of us.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	My husbands uncle sends out a Christmas letter complaining on the long lines in the ER for the uninsured - complaining about those same things with entitlement, free-loaders.<br>  <br>  Then he hides his mothers income/assets, so that the state will pay for her elderly care.|`|p9GOxzsNaa	Its a fairness and a 'me too' problem. Many typical middle class folks are finding that hard work, sacrifice, education and hope for a better life has fallen short of expectations, and in turn reaped only benefits for immigrants, welfare folks, and the elite. People in section 8 housing on welfare are watching and affording cable TV all day and wearing $100 sneakers. The elite, bankers and CEOs are living large on their bonuses and now bailout money, attending fancy black-tie like Governor affairs and $25,000 plate Hollywood parties. What about the rest of the middle-america taxpayer who struggles paycheck to paycheck just to try to pay for a college education or mortgage or retirement? The welfare low income and the upper income folks are able to get paid assistance or free services to take care of their needs, while the middle or low income person has to do everything on their own. The green-card immigrants take American jobs and then go back to their home country for 2-months paid vacations with higher standards of living than most Americans, while the Green-cards are less subject to lay-offs because companies fear losing the number of green cards they are entitled to at corporate human resources so the American citizen worker is laid off first. The illegals get US services and pay no taxes, and if you try to get them off your property you could be sued and lose your home. The typical American worker gets less vacation, and has less job security than immigrants and other countries. When the average person hears about illegal immigrants like Obama's own Kenya aunt living in welfare housing and getting public assistance for all her expenses, and nothing is done to deport her, charge her with fraud or to recover the money, the people don't feel entitled, but feel the government system is now a bully to its own citizens. When Christians can't pray in school but Muslims can, and Christians are forced to pay for someone else's abortions which is against their values, it's It's not all about entitlement, it's about fairness, equal treatment, and respect. It's the US middle class and lower class who most feel the brunt of the taxes and the reduced American standard of living and healthcare, and see the US-based grants and scholarships going to non-US students, to minorities, or to the elite and big business. In the US, the top 5% live the best of all nations, and the bottom 25% live worse than in many second-tier countries.  The US is one of the most expensive medical systems, although the US ranks 37th as to quality of care by the World Health Organization. The government is paying groups like ACORN to provide a voice for low income people and they work for more entitlements for the lower income. I believe the American worker is entitled to fair and equal treatment and today that they are not getting that, certainly the stimulus package falls far short in achieving fairness and benefits for majority of American citizens.

You should tell him. He might want to be with you when you go to the doctors. And it also may upset him if he finds out you knew this and never told him.|`|AhXl6kflaa	well congrats I'd go ahead and share the excitement and let him know then share the moment of u both at  the doctor's office together|`|qmfW6CQBaa	Well you're pregnant and i don't thinka doctor needs to tell you that much.

UXhFcHCHaa	when my son was sick he had diarriah and the dr said its associated with the cold. it should go away in a few days. just make sure she is drinking her bottles. i was also told that the milk makes the diarriah worse so you may want to give her an oz or 2 of pedialyte just to help out. to be honest you have already taken her to the dr. the dr will not do anything for a cold or diarriah just make sure she is eating and if she keeps having it then offer her milk every 15 min just to keep her hydrated|`|8e28748a17831ead96054edd5a8684fbaa	mmm<br>  it is probably a regular cold<br>  my baby brother (6 months) is like that too.<br>  He throws up and coughs and also has diarreah. The doctor gave him some medication and it seems like he is getting better.|`|f1AvsgCDaa	take to doctors
GWveqx61aa	well if your period is always a month late that would mean that your cycle is about 56 days, which if this is correct you shgould see a dr, but that feeling that you are feeling could be ovulation especially if your period is wack as you say it is, good luck
yUgg0lPjaa	I think when i was 12 my mum let me start going on public transport to get to town. I got the train and bus for the first time when i was 12 and my friends and me could go shopping withough parents (as long as they knew were we were and had phones).<br>  When i was 12 i first started getting interested in the fashions and started wearing some mascara. <br>  We talked about boys, a lot, and when out with them which at the time involved no contact whatsoever !<br>  <br>  <br>  to be honest i dont think you should or shouldnt be doing anything. Its up to you and your parents not the rest of us. Just have fun and be happy !|`|FVGRldteaa	I really don't think 12 year olds should be bothering about makeup and miniskirts like you've mentioned because they are still in the youngest part of secondary/high school. It looks weird when a child of that s trying to flaunt their body, children at that age should keep their cute simple features and not dress them up in make and such. <br>  <br>  When I was that age we just wanted to act like kids and be kids we didn't want to become adults so quickly. I'm in sixth from at the moment it is just strange to see two year 7 kissing. They shouldn't be thinking about it, it looks too unusual. They should be completely free but as kids not as adults which is evident that children are growing up too fast, I can't see why they don't just embrace childhood.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped <br>  <br>  :)|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	I think 12 year olds should be doing pretty much anything as long as it includes going to school (I hated school).<br>  I certainly don't think they should be even interested in wearing make up or short skirts, surely that's not practical for running about and playing in.<br>  I think I spent most of my time as a twelve year old playing Sonic the Hedgehog (yes, I'm that old), watching films and whinging about school|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I think 12 year olds should be allowed to make decisions regarding their hobbies, what they watch on TV, their friends....however they shouldn't be drinking, smoking, having sex, wearing too much make up, wearing revealing clothing....<br>  <br>  Unfortunately though a lot do, and those that are teens now see nothing wrong with it!<br>  <br>  Edit: Susie I love you answer, it made me giggle!|`|UkJU2ADcaa	My sister is 12 (turning 13 in july) We dont live together so i dont monitor what she does. However, I wouldn't want her kissing boys and wearing revealing clothes. That's just not where a 12 year olds mind should be. Yes, it is normal to think about and like boys but messing around with them is out of the question.  <br>  <br>  If she chose to wear mini skirts, that would be okay by me only because i know my sister is a responsible young lady. It all depends on the child and how they are raised.|`|xaf3poA3aa	They should be allowed to where whatever they want... as long as they buy it whith their own money. if parents are footin the bill then they get some say in the clothes they buy.<br>  <br>  As far as freedom... what are ya gonna do ride your bike somewhere? If you can get there by yourself i say more power to ya but if a parent has to drive you then again... they have some control.|`|cTM07yNwaa	12 year old shouldnt be trying to grow up so fast. NO SLUTTY CLOTHES!<br>  <br>  like come one 12?!<br>  <br>  i would say a little makeup is okay but not like pure black caked on.<br>  <br>  i think that 12 year olds should have some freedom but they still need to learn ALOT before they can have more freedom.<br>  <br>  just live your life as a kid, enjoy it while it lasts|`|jqfLkfE5aa	I'm not 12 I'm 13 but they should be allowed to wear a little make up such as eyeliner and mascara and no more than 3 piercing on each ear.

When I was 11 last summer i was aloud to stay out to 9:30pm because it was still light in the evanings, but i dont know seeing im 12 now, i normally talk to my friends on facebook/bebo/msn <br>  <br>  ( I only really know for girls really )<br>  <br>  (: xx|`|8uy5SZCfaa	they should be allowed to wear whatever apart from anything that looks really slutty<br>  go shopping/days out with friends<br>  wear make up<br>  they shouldn't be going out at night, smoking, drugs, drinking ( apart fro special occasions )|`|rNvXWMOMaa	I think they should be listening to their parents<br>  And if they don't they should be grounded for 10 days.|`|JFr7fCiXaa	12 year old should be taking a SLOW transition to adulthood which includes getting more responsibilities <br>  at this age freedom should be increasing, i.e be allowed to go to town with friends but parents should know where they are and get to say what they can and cant do,<br>  <br>  at the end of the day 12 year olds don't know what is right or wrong really, they are still learning, when i was 12 i couldnt see that but am glad that i had someone looking out for me as not all 12 year old should. <br>  <br>  12 year old shouldnt be drinking/smoking/having sex/dressing like prostitutes unless they want to look like chav kids. <br>  they can start wearing a little bit of makeup and choosing there own clothes etc|`|aZTrQKMwaa	Her mind needs to be on schoolwork, friends and family, and cartoons. They can have some freedom like go to birthday parties or to the movies, but as far as having boyfriends...no. When I was 12 I couldn't even spell boyfriend, lol. They should be playing with dolls(I was), doing homework, and listening to good music. She shouldn't be worried about boyfriends because at her age, she doesn't know what love is and she's never been in love.

He wouldn't like mini skirts!!!|`|mTyu7CKoaa	I think 12 year olds should be more worried about school, than make up and mini skirts....

Ow6lKFXiaa	Sounds quite possible.  While the breast tenderness and heaviness could be PMS pain and the extra peeing could be just losing water retained from the delayed period, the veins are often one of the first signs (although this is not in any medical books and is still a theory by those who've never experienced it).  I suggest you take an at-home pregnancy test or contact your doctor for a test.  That's the only way to be sure.<br>  <br>  Edit:   I had blue veins with my first at less than 2 weeks and with my second at just about 2 weeks.  I've talked to many who have also experienced this very early.  Every one has different symptoms at different times. I also had excess peeing within the first week for both pregnancies.  My breast tenderness actually came later than most.  Again, a test is the only real way to know this early.  But be aware, home tests are not always reliable, my first 2 home tests with my second were both negative the day before I went to the doctor and tested positive.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I would take a test to find out for sure|`|yOyg3gnJaa	Peeing more frequently this early, if you were pregnant, is not a sign of pregnancy.  Nothing has grown big enough to cause pressure on your bladder at this point.  Some people do experience tender, and sometimes achy breasts when their period is about to come, and having a late period once in awhile is something that just happens with some women.<br>  My advise, take a pregnancy test, it will calm your worries and fears on pregnancy.  I don't know why you wouldn't have taken one already?<br>  Good luck.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Swwet heart u wouldn have the blue veins in ur breast this early in your pregnancy. I don't think your pregnant|`|eytlIKITaa	Take a test, that's the only way to tell.  Good luck!|`|XyRzSzjtaa	id say u was take a test chick<br>  <br>  good luck|`|b8f0CfSsaa	It is very rare you would get symptoms this early. You would feel sleepy and have sore boobs, but the blue veins come a little later. <br>  <br>  Peeing more at night time, as mentioned is a little early.|`|AA11215737	Well, first of all, have you been having sex during your last ovulation period?|`|sOO93u5Oaa	You could be pregnant.

Ccq8zEcnaa	You are entitled to child support from the father. They will probably have a paternity test done in this case. And once he is sued for child support, he has rights to visitation and partial custody... Unless he is a felon with a record or something.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	You should see a lawyer<br>  Get it set up before<br>  You can talk to the ex<br>  Some will give money with out an order, but both still need to do on<br>  If you two are talking, you should agree on visitation<br>  Some people agree, on taking the child during the day, and bring the child back at night<br>  If you can come to agreement about visitation before the courts get involved, it will be better<br>  Even, if you come to agreement with support, you need to get a court order, for your own protection|`|pp9RzHvDaa	You will more than likely be the primary, custodial parent and he will be the non cusotdial parent unless he can prove you unfit.  Your rights are deciding who will be in the delivery room, what name goes on the birth certificate, and if the father's name goes on the birth certificate.  If you put his name on the birth certificate, he will have rights that will have to be established by court.  Usually allowing him vistation rights every other weekend and some holidays, depending on your state and the situation.  In turn, he will have to pay child support every month.  If you do not put his name on the birth certificate as the father, he will not have rights until paternity is established through a DNA test and he will not be required to pay child support until his name is on the birth certificate.  I would talk to an attorney now and see if you can get papers drawn up dealing with standard visitation so you won't have to deal with it when the baby gets here.

Just want maybe one more though!|`|uuHPneEcaa	i want more children, but I think I am going to wait a while before I have another. My son's fathers wants one right away.. I TOLD HIM u have two other babies (3 and 1) beside the one I am about to have. don't u think u can give me time to relax. NOPE he wants them right away! I love babies and I wanted 3 but I think one more is all I can handle.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Your in the easy months lol. I loved being pregnant around then too. Toward the end your feeling MIGHT change a little. But then again you could be way different than me. I want more kids but I am very ready for this pregnancy to be over and have my little girl.|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	Yeah.... but ...<br>  <br>  Are you actually around groups of small children a lot? What is your attitude about childbirth and the permanent changes in your body and identity? Pregnancy is to motherhood, as a first date is to marriage.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your pregnancy, but don't make anyone any promises just yet! I hope you're able to have the family you want. =)|`|AA10153923	Most people like being pregnant. That might be it.<br>  I want more kids, I love being pregnant too...<br>  But I dont want to rush it what so ever<br>  <br>  So I guess its normal
SnQvsOPwaa	Zabes<br>  I don't know how long this has been going on. If this has just started you need to let her know that this kind of behavior is not acceptable. Then punish or discipline as you normally would. If this has been going on for a while it will be harder to reel it in. When your both calmed down, removed from the situation you need to teach her constructive ways to deal with anger. There are many different technics so do your research and pick the ones that fit you best. I have a 7 year old girl and a 16 year old boy. Both have tested this approach at different times. I have a policy that I address any behavioral issues right then. I normally don't have to scream yell or punish. I talk they listen and if they don't change I punish using different things depending on whats going on in their life and what I think will make the largest impact at that time.|`|FplTPoAyaa	Yes, yes, yes ! Are you sure we don't have the same daughter ? I have a 12 year old as well and she fits the description to a tee.  And like you, I thought we had another year or two before this behavior started.  Our daughter receives discipline as well, but the behavior continues.  i believe young people are "growing up" faster than we did at their age.  Good luck and hope things get a bit easier for all of us !|`|wTevmGbmaa	Oh yeah, you are not alone.  My 13 year old is doing the same thing.. and I asked my self the same question, I didn't start being a ***** to my parents until I was like 16.  It's all of the hormones in the food today, same reason she is probably developing faster than we did and she'll probably start her period sooner than we did to.. Don't worry it is normal.  Good Luck.|`|cMTSlbfEaa	my sister and i both went through that stage when we were around 12-14 as well, and it continued into our teens. i'm 20 now, and it's surprising to look back and see that i was acting like that, but i think it's normal behavior.|`|JWHtk4Xbaa	Im 18 now, But at the age of 12 I was just the same way. I would throw big fits scream. I did also yell that I hated my parents. It was just a stage for me after that I had my fits but they werent as bad.|`|6Kq1ExFxaa	Girls remember go through puberty earlier than boys.
e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	The pill often changes cycles, but generally they should return to normal, how they were before being on the pill.  Also, it depends on how long you were using the pill.  Since you only used it for a few months, your periods should return to normal pretty quickly.  I was on the pill for 4 years, just got off June 2008 and my periods still haven't returned to normal; they're around 42 days in length now, and were 29 before being on the pill.  It is possible to get pregnant immediately after stopping the pill, so if you BD'ed around the time of ovulation after you stopped the pill, you could be pregnant.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|tJzlPhm5aa	Hey I was on BC for six years when I finally stopped and while on the pill my cycles were 28 days and now I have 30 day cycles.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Also, like you my last cycle started on Jan 29 so I am not looking to start again until Saturday.  I also don't have any symptoms until the day I actually start.  But, I am praying that this month will be my lucky month!!
AA11481889	Well all I have is personal experience as my reliable source...<br>  <br>  When I was a child I listened to my mother because if I didn't I knew I'd get an asswhooping.  <br>  <br>  It was a simple lesson of accountability and consequence.  <br>  The rules were made perfectly clear and  If I broke a rule, I was held accountable and paid the consequence.<br>  I did what I was told, I respected my elders, I didn't mouth off and I followed the rules...or else.<br>  <br>  And as far as whether it's good or bad...well lets see.<br>  <br>  In the 50's when parents still had some common sense and spanked their kids...we didn't have druggie, prego, gangster, wise-asses running around acting like their crap doesn't stink.<br>  <br>  And now in 2009, when far too many parents are silly new ager "enlightened" thinkers, our crime rates have never been higher, our teen pregnancy rates have never been higher, our drug use has never been higher...<br>  <br>  Hmmmm that's a statistic that can be plainly seen to anyone...no Psychological study required.<br>  <br>  American parents have lost their back bone and as a result we have a bunch of whining self indulgent entitled brats having their own brats at the ripe old age of 15 .....<br>  <br>  I would think that a good damn many of us need a good spanking.  Perhaps it will knock some sense back into us.|`|YkseyT7zaa	It's a consequence of your actions. It works for most but not all, but better than no consequence at all.<br>  Responsibility for your actions is something that is lacking in America|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I teach my children to stand up for themselves, but not to hit.  I prefer to be an example for my children, so I do not hit.|`|VUfT35UQaa	I think if you hit your kids, then your kids will learn that hitting others is a way to control people and may end up abusing their partners when they are older, or being violent at school, or even hitting their parents, because they will think, "If mum or dad hits me when they don't like what I do, I can hit them if they annoy me" and that is wrong<br>  <br>  Answer mine please: Is it right to smack children:<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuG0Z9HB2yDRb6Om3xApEWkazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224180929AA2VlLq">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|AA11828439	Yes, I am good and so is my daughter. We were both spanked, when it was called for. Sometimes it is the ONLY way to teach a LIFE lesson.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	i think its a good punishment for people on here<br>  who ask questions and refuse to use a spell checker.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Well as a personal opinion, spanking has been going on for hundreds of years, up until 10 years ago, where Nanny state started to butt into familial affairs.<br>  The lack of spanking has lured children into violent, undisciplined and irresponsible teenagers.<br>  At least 20 years ago (i was spanked in private and public) and well i turned out normal.  And not like recent research suggests that spanking will lead children to turn into maniacs that want to kill themselves.<br>  <br>  Of course if you spank your child in public you will be reprimanded!! It's nearly illegal to do so, because the state says so. But history has proven that spanking is a good way of disciplining!!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I would not get a hospital or phsycological study to back up my answer because people that get their ideas out of books do not know how to think for themselves and the answers are uusually pretty limited in thought.<br>  <br>  I believe spanking is a good and perfectly acceptible form of discipline when the situation warrants it.  Spanking on its own is not...you have to have rules and authority and make it clear to your childrent to respect you as their parents.  You have to be firm, yet loving and you have to never argue or give in to child, you must be consistant.|`|xH7L6Vvdaa	I really think it varies from one person to another. I have known people who never even raise there voice to there children and they are very well mannered. There are so many people who spank there children when they are angry and they do it to hard ( I have witnessed this by my own sister). If you do decide to spank  do not do it when you are mad. I have found with my own son that a time out chair works well. There are times that a spanking is necessary. It all comes down to consistency. Whatever you are doing make sure you are consistent!|`|p9GOxzsNaa	Spanking is no longer acceptable and in many places is considered illegal and child abuse which can lead to risky sex or abuse problems later in life. Sometimes parents use a tap on the infant's diaper to get the child's attention, just because the child is startled by the sound, there is no pain, but another method is preferred such as a firm No and redirection. Later the timeout penalty, and the naughty chair placed in a distant location where you can observe the child.|`|6egxGam6aa	Spanking has been going on for hundreds - no, thousands - of years. No one had died of psychological trauma yet. I was spanked as a child when I directly did something my parents asked me not to do (which all children do at some point), and I'm doing just fine today.<br>  <br>  I agree with the second answer - lack of responsibility for one's actions is dwindling rapidly. How are our children going to learn to be responsible adults and take blame for their wrongdoings if we don't teach them?<br>  <br>  And no, I'm not saying that one should "hit" one's child for a minor wrongdoing. But if the child has been told repeatedly not to (for example) pick up something or touch something, a small pop on the hand would not be unjustified.|`|CyG2YDI3aa	I spank my children and I thinks its a fine form of a discipline. Next time they do something I have spanked them for, I promise you they think twice about it.<br>  <br>  And idk what all this fuss about "If you spank your kids they will hit" is. I spank my kids and they do not hit other kids or each other.|`|F4rD4HF0aa	I don't think it should be used to solve everything no but when a child crosses the line I think a spankin is called for.   <br>  <br>  It better than being hit with a belt like i was|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	hiting a child will cause psychological harm later on in their life....instead of liking you they will fear you as a parent.....i suggest a timeout as an alternative....

aLAmvX5Naa	Girls tend to get this stuff before boys. 8 years ago I was a nanny for a little 5 year old boy. We were at the park and this 4 year old girl was next to him on the swing. She was going on and on about how she could do this and that and knew this and that, and he replied with "I peed my pants at the library today".<br>  <br>  Anyway, just try your best. It takes all caregivers in a joint effort to teach skills like that. But kids don't have to know all that before school. That is why they go to school, to learn.<br>  <br>  Why not just focus on the abc song for now and once he gets that you can try to teach other things. One thing at a time.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I agree with Alyssa's Mommy. Boys tend to take longer to develop and learn completely different than girls do. Boys tend to be much more hands on and visual so try teaching him in a non-traditional way.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	good on ya for wanting to help him my lil girl is almost 3 and she already knows her adc's and can count,  yeah is parents are just lazy far out looks like youve got a lot of work ahead of you <br>  try making it as fun as you can write adc's in big bright colours and when he gets it right tell him how clever he is and make a really big fuss and clap|`|WsUSAgLmaa	Wow...his parent really should have been working with him was he never in daycare or anything. My son is almost 3 and he has been singing his abc since 1 and he knows his number correctly up until 15...and struggles after that. But his daycare center, teaches them things..Im still working on colors with him. He is learning circles and squares and triangles and she's even started giving him homework. I think its great that you wanna show him...but its gonna be really tough now!! Good Luck!! Shame on his mommy and daddy!!|`|a1uoxczTaa	i also watch a four year old, when i started working here she was three and already knew spell and write her whole name... her first name is a bit hard let alone a full name (Cadence) she can read and write n i am now working on subtraction. i just play fun games with her out of no where i will start singing the abc's or b like hmmm what does shirt start with because it makes the shhh so i try to teach it to her. it is not really our responsibility but if the parents request it it is nice to help out. try to tell the childs parents what you are doing to help him learn and c how they plan to help also. learning at this age should b more fun then feel like a school thing.|`|giCUEYsJaa	I'm a retired preschool teacher and ...<br>  <br>  Girls learn faster then boys - it's a fact!<br>  <br>  I would encourage you to sing the ABC song to him while holding up flash cards.  Children learn quickly through song and movement. <br>  <br>  I would also encourage you to help him write the letters of the alphabet - until he can easily recognize and write each one by himself.  Be sure you give him a wide/thick pencil or marker and at the beginning gently guide his hand to form the proper letters.  Do don't get discouraged if he writes some letters backwards, like S or Z - it's perfectly normal.  Once he's comfortable writing all his letters, I would then encourage him to write each letter of his first name only.<br>  <br>  Don't dismiss that he's not color blind.  My son knew his colors at age 2 and then when he was age 7 - we were told her was color blind.  He learned the different hues to identify his colors.  <br>  <br>  Patience and Persistence and Lots of Hugs will prove to be your best tools.<br>  <br>  Don't worry if he still doesn't get everything.  Because I have had students enter my class who didn't recognize any letters or colors, but within 2 months they were right up with the rest of the class.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|txv7TIgiaa	i watch a three year old who has limited speech but she can count to 5 but doesn't know had abc's he needs his parents to teach him it is not your responsiblity to teach him everything but you can try to help him learn as much as you can!|`|Q5oBepLeaa	No its not wrong to teach him his basics. Its awesome that you are, not alot of parents are teaching them anything and they wonder why their kids are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... behind.|`|LZfEhqYdaa	You are not wrong for trying to teach him these things, but your sense of urgency about it could possibly make him resistant to learning them if he can pick up on your worries.  Do you think he might have picked up on the concern a bit?  It is just a thought...maybe you could make it into a game, or use colorful flash cards or a fun DVD.  My daughter learned her letters, numbers, and some basic math from a Leapfrog DVD that her aunt gave her and she is only 3.  When it is fun and exciting, children learn naturally.  But it is really wonderful of you to be trying to teach him the basics.  I am sure his parents will be pleased to see his progress.
KNxs4PrZaa	i took that exact combonation,  yes i took the metformin the whole time ever day while i took the others.  it took a two months trying,   and currently 30 weeks with baby girl! Baby dust!!!!!|`|TZ4mbFh3aa	I have!  I took the provera for a couple months and the clomid for 6 months and on the 6th month I conceived =)  Good luck to you!|`|g29VfDGvaa	This posting has made me feel much better!<br>  <br>  I ALSO start provera and clomid 50mg CD 5-9 this month! (I already take metformin 2000mg a day)<br>  <br>  Be aware that if you haven't taken metformin before, it can REALLY make you have to be very near a ladies room. :/<br>  <br>  I will hope the best for both of us! Its our month!<br>  <br>  *****Baby dust*****|`|8h5OYw4Haa	I didn't do quite the same as you, but did Clomid 100mg CD 3-7, and then on CD 12 received a 10,000 units shot of Novorel (HCG). Only took 1 round and I am pregnant. I am told that it usually takes 2 or 3 rounds before conception, but I will keep my fingers crossed for you!
BExscPOtaa	well, space starts getting limited around 33 weeks or so.  however, you should still be able to feel very consistent movement, it just might not be quite as strong, as your baby doesn't have room to be a little acrobat anymore.  ;)  did your dr give you a kick count sheet yet?  if not, you will probably get one soon.  if you are worried about her not moving enough, drink some ice water or maybe cold juice and lay on your left side.  your kick chart should tell you how many kicks are normal to feel within an hour, and if it's less than that you can call your dr.  with my first, I had to go in a few times for a non-stress test, where they measure your baby's movements.  I was always paranoid about him not moving, but he was totally fine in there.  and I remember he started getting crowded in there around 33 weeks or so.  congrats on your little girl!!|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	I'm 31 weeks and mine is still making my shirt move when I lay down.<br>  <br>  As long as you do the fetal kick count, you will know that everythign is fine with your little one when it is time for them to slow down.  (Eat a meal then lay on your left side for 2 hours - as long as you get 10 fetal movements in those 2 hours - all is well.....if not, contact your doctor and tell them that your baby failed the fetal movement test and they will want you to come in and get hooked up to a fetal monitor just in case)|`|R8fVBPnmaa	I really do'nt have a clue !?!..

Bw1h5xAcaa	Normal is lower than 140/80. There is no "too low" unless you're symptomatic - dizzy, weak, shaking and sweaty and nauseated.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	"Normal" for everyone is different. During pregnancy your blood pressure usually drops during the second trimester and eventually goes back up to your normal by mid-end of pregnancy. Since you started with a B/P of 100/60 a blood pressure of 140/80, which is the standard by which most people go by to determine high blood pressure, would be high for you. If your blood pressure continues to rise your doctor may be come concerned as high blood pressure can keep the baby from getting the necessary blood and oxygen. But a single reading being higher than normal is nothing to worry about, it's when they consistently are getting high readings that the concern is raised. Blood pressure can vary in each individual and can be affected by things like stress, caffeine or change in environment. Best of luck to you with your pregnancy.|`|iwYu32N2aa	If your BP is 120/80 and under its normal.<br>  <br>  <br>  What the Numbers Mean<br>  <br>  If your blood pressure is less than 120/802:<br>  <br>      * Your blood pressure is normal<br>  <br>  If your blood pressure is between 120/80 and 140/902:<br>  <br>      * You’re at risk for high blood pressure. Lifestyle modifications are important and should be recommended by your doctor or healthcare professional<br>  <br>  If your blood pressure is:<br>  <br>  140/90 and above<br>  or<br>  130/80 and above<br>  AND<br>  you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease2:<br>  <br>      * Your blood pressure is high. Lifestyle modifications and high blood pressure medication are important and should be recommended by your doctor or healthcare professional|`|lRq81lu7aa	Normal blood pressure is 120/80, so you sound okay.<br>  <br>  Bad blood pressure would be like 150/100.  The nurse or doctor can let you know if it is okay or not and they should be on top of it if your BP is not.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	yea its ok. normal is about 120/80 so your good|`|KTbo7dWlaa	When you go to your doctors ask them if you should be concern with your blood pressure going up every-time you check it. Also when you check are you in a good mood or are you stressed out? You should only take your blood pressure when your relaxed. Try deep breathing when your stressed out. it will help relax you and its good for the baby. Good Luck|`|p7I2ko3qaa	you could now if did something if you dont why are you worring,it just human nature.|`|v3LnJycKaa	they really pay close attention to the bottom number if that peaks into the 90's you are in early stage preeclampsia if it moves in to the 100's you will most likely be induced, i was i went from 112/68 to 147/101 in a week... <br>  <br>  this pregnancy i have been quite low 95/54
4WJM3j9Aaa	she is an a**|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If we all stop talking about her she will slowly fade away. She stays in the media because people keep talking about her.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Im just waiting for nano-mom - is that 9?|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Yes, I'm sick of it, and I am angry because the birth of octuplets, all of whom survived, would have been a wonderful story.  In other circumstances, I would have loved hearing about all of this.<br>  Then it turns out that this woman is freakin' insane and her fertility doctor is a quack.  At this point, we all know the story.  Let her slip into well-deserved obscurity.  She obviously craves attention; let's not give her any more. <br>  The only ones who should be looking at this woman are Child Protective Services.  Give those babies to some stable, sane parents and be done with it.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Did you hear about the ned Dennys breakfast in her honor?<br>  <br>  8 eggs, no sausage and the guy in the next booth gets the bill|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I'm tired of it.

It's very sad that this world lives for drama, weather it's about her or Chris Brown fight or everything else, we normal middle class/lower class people have done some amazing things im sure & NOBODY put's that on the internet, tv, news...exc!!  She had 8 kids, she already had 6...YES IT'S WRONG!!!  BUT, what is the big deal, it happened, everyone needs to get over i...she'll have her own tv show in a few years just like Jon & Kate Plus 8, and 17 kids & pregnant...exc...its all for money im sure!|`|AElFESKVaa	We'll the government controls the media so what else do you expect than to see them talking about a very less important subject.  You also know that shes getting big bucks for those interviews under the table and to think shes getting welfare too?|`|FYiKgeN8aa	Absolutely!  However, you realize that you are contributing to hearing about her by asking who's sick of hearing about her.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	LOL nano-mom! Yes, I'm sick of hearing about it especially now that Dr. Phil is involved. It will all fade away quickly, unfortunately for her. Hopefully she has some sort of plan.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	YES!

Giving the patients the exact procedure she wanted. This is a fertility clinic. They get paid to make babies. She did not want to destroy the embryos therefore she kept them and implanted them. What ever happened to pro-choicers? Her body her choice. It's a personal decision between a woman and her doctor. or Pro lifers=Life begins at conception.  There is a guideline but completely voluntary. You can volunteer for the PTA. Just because you don't volunteer for the PTA does not mean you are excluded from that school.|`|5QtseYWuaa	What I'm sick of hearing about in how she loves her kids so much.

You can have an amniocentesis done but thats always risky for the baby. One of the most important rules in life: be faithful in marriage.
hKJIDdVqaa	I have been in the same situation with my step son, his girlfriend and numerous borders.  You will be amaze how quickly you can get someone to flee your house if you set boundaries and stick with them.  Great he has a roof over his head, now it is time to make it undesirable.  You have to been in the house at X time, you have to be out of the house for work at X time.  Lights off at X time, rent is due at X time, if it is not paid, you have a week to vacate.  Have to buy own food, toiletries, laundry detergent, etc. TV and phone are extra.  No loud noise, no rude talking, etc.  Your home seems to cozy and comfy, why would he leave.  Remove the comfort, you will thus remove the problem.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You CAN kick him out, he's not your responsibility (he's his own).   Lay down the rules, go to work, earn money and pay rent or you're out - and stick to it.   I would do that to my own brother, and I have!   The streets aren't the end of the world, and brothers can come back from the streets when they are ready - just remind him he has a place with you if he follows your expectations, otherwise he needs to go.|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	Why you?  Because your husband "loves" his brother, but not enough to make him stand on his own two feet.<br>  Why you?  Because either you have not communicated the problem clearly enough to your husband that you have had enough, OR, you have, and he is letting you know which one of you is most important in his life.<br>  <br>  You are under no obligation to lie for Ken.  Go get Ken out of bed and let him know that under no circumstances are you willing to lie for him, and that if his boss calls, he will hear the truth.  It is also time for you to set some boundaries with him.<br>  <br>  He would not 'literally be on the streets' for very long.  He simply has a very high tolerance for pain.  So, in order for him to be motivated, the circumstances must be very strong.  If he were out on the streets, he would find a homeless shelter, and get his *** a job and be motivated to keep it in order to not be homeless.  He could even join the military, and have a great job with fantastic benefits, and STRONG motivation to perform, which would be very good for him.<br>  <br>  As Dear Abby says, every single time people write to her with this exact same problem, "nobody can walk all over you without your permission". So stop giving permission.  If he is doesn't pick up after himself, put his stuff in a garbage bag and put it out by the curb.  If he is disrespectful to you or your daughter, he has to leave the house.  If he doesn't go to work every day, his deadline can be bumped up to immediately.  Pack up his stuff and putit, and him, on the curb, and either he will take care of it, or the garbage man will.  It is, after all, YOUR house, and you make the rules.  So make some.<br>  <br>  Also, he doesn't want to get the heck out of there.  He has found a couple of suckers who will give him permanent room and board and he doesn't have to do anything because they are emotionally attached to the idea that the poor little baby will be homeless.  Well, homeless is what happens to rude people with no respect who won't do what it takes to hold down a job.  Why should you and your husband be subject to that basic rule of physics, but not him?<br>  <br>  He will stop getting on your nerves when you take control.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	You are enabling this lazy **ss...stop waking him up ...let him oversleep and get in trouble or even lose his job, don't tell the boss if he phones that he is sick...say he is not there and you don't know where he is...or better yet, tell the boss he is lazing around in bed and said for me to tell you he was sick, but he isn't.  Don't clean up after him, don't do anything for him at all.  He should be kicked out right this second really and he never should have been let into your home in the first place...he is an an adult...he is not entitled to personal free care..he has to learn to stand on his own two feet and he isn't going to do that if everyone keeps taking care of everyting for him.|`|AA12145826	Oh good golly miss molly......what a pickle you've gotten yourself into.<br>  <br>  1) Accept the fact that you let this happen. Not just Josh, you let it happen too. Now decide what you're going to do about it.<br>  <br>  2) MAKE RULES. Sit Josh down, come up with a list of rules that Ken has to follow and the consequences for breaking them. Sit the whole lot of you down and go over this list. Make Ken sign it (its now a legal document, so keep it somewhere safe). Include his deadline in it. He's got 3 plus months to secure a job and find a place to live, he better get moving. Pick up a few of those rental advertisements at the grocery store next time you're there and give them to Ken. No need to be subtle.  <br>  <br>  3) STICK TO THE RULES. There is no gray area. Either he followed the rule in its entirety or he didn't. If you say "You must be in the house by 10pm and lights out at 11pm Sun-Thurs, midnight Fri-Sat." and he wants to watch a movie until 11:30pm on Wed, too bad, so sad.<br>  <br>  4) DON'T BE A DOORMAT. If Josh wants to live with this louse and keep enabling his sloppy behavior, lazy attitude, and bad habits, that's fine, just let him know where he can find you when he wants to see his daughter. <br>  <br>  5) REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR ROLE IS. You're the parents of a 19 month old daughter, not a 19 yr old grown man. Send Ken home to his own Mother if you have to.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|CxCigxZIaa	You're right...you can't just kick him out. <br>  It wouldn't be right. However you can give him some OPTIONS (his brother can)<br>  He hands over his ENTIRE paycheck from now on. He gets 5 dollars a day to eat on UNLESS he takes his lunch to work and then he needs nadda. <br>  When he has enough money saved for his own place then at that time will he start to get his paychecks back BECAUSE he won't be in your home any longer..he'll have his own. (maybe close to you guys but not IN your home would be best for the brothers)<br>  Set down some rules (have his brother do this)<br>  By the way: WHERE is the MOM? (Josh and Ken's) IF you can contact her then by all means do so...or have your boyfriend contact her and let her know "what a mess" he's in.<br>  G'luck|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Set rules for the brother to clean up after himself and any messes he makes.<br>  Talk to your boyfriend about all of this.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Tell him to get out.

I promise you if he misses work because you didn't wake him up, he won't depend on you to do it again. And you are also not his answering service.Tell him he has two options. You can look on the caller ID if you have it and not answer it if it's them or you can call him to the phone. What he expects of you is ridiculous!<br>  <br>  Oh and your husband needs to have a talk w/ him to make sure he is respectful of you...otherwise he should be out now not on some deadline.
oP504BtFaa	They fear you, they get hurt, it could make them aggressive, it could make them resent you, it's just plain wrong (you wouldn't physically discipline your peers, coworkers, friends, or anyone, so why use physical force with a helpless child when you clearly have superiority?)|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	Well what kind of physical force are we talking about? A tap on the rear or abuse? I'm all for the tap on the rear but anything else is extreme. I can go to any restaurant and tell the difference between a kid that knows what a spanking is and a time-out kid. I got spanked, it made me not want to get into trouble.I wasn't beat on and so far I've stayed out of jail.I would have been hell on wheels if there were no consequences for my actions. And I was such a self entertaining kid that I'd have found something to do in a corner or time out chair.|`|uLLQovSyaa	I believe there is a difference in child abuse and just a spanking.A good spanking now and then shouldn't damage the poor psyche of a kid.Look at what kids are like now days because parents won't make them behave.And heaven forbid they get a paddling at school or get a cell phone taken away.I grew up getting spankings and I don't need therapy for it.|`|AA11946005	They start to fear you and won't come to you with problems when they are older because they fear the backlash of physical force.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	you might hurt your hand<br>  if they have something in their back pockets..|`|4WyUrWaIaa	''Physical force'' lol ... you mean spanking !!<br>  <br>  If done sparingly & as a last resort, and not out of anger, it's a good disciplining method. It teaches a child respect, if not done (again) out of anger .... it teaches the child that there are consequences for their actions .... <br>  <br>  I only spank my son if he does something out of spite & on purpose. I do it, if he puts himself in a life or death situation, like running out behinde my car as I'm driving out of the drive way (followed by a hug!)<br>  <br>  ADD - spanking is not physcial abuse !! Kicking your child, punching your child, pinching your child ... pushing your child .... are all physcial force .... spanking, is disiplining.|`|2p39nEdHaa	If you hit too hard or are not consistent it could have negative affects as the child grows up. I will say though that a good firm open handed spanking on the bottom (depending on the offense) never hurt anyone.|`|UlES6P2vaa	It's just plain wrong and completely unnecessary.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	They may not respond to others who dont/cannot use it, such as teachers, police officers, life guards, security guards.  <br>  <br>  And most of these professions arent paid enough to coming running to mom and dad, every time they would feel its a spankable offense.
Q5oBepLeaa	Why dont you go to Target? They have a good selection on snack bowls. thats where i get mines for my kids|`|aLAmvX5Naa	There is no snack bowl on the market for young toddlers that will hold something small like cheerios. The gerber bowl works great for bigger snacks, its not meant to contain tiny stuff. Until your child is old enough to work something with a lid you will have to accept spills will happen with independent feeding.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	there is tons of tupperwear around that will do the job you are hoping for, but at 15 months, you are going to have a mess in your car as they dont quite grasp the actual concept.. he is just going to shake the cherrios or snacks out of it cause its fun.

yj3ZWwU8aa	OMG i went through a very similar experience. Except the little boy I watched was just bad. ( I wont get into that right now) but you need to tell that woman you cant watch her son until he can hold a sippy cup and does a little more on his own. you have a child that also needs taking care of and you cant spend your days babying an almost 2 year old. Tell her your happy to do it if she puts the effort in to make her child more independant but if he comes back and does the same thing call her a tell her to come get him. Like i said I went through something very similar. the little boy I watched ended up moving back with his mom and when she couldn't handle him anymore his grandparents asked me to watch him again and I said I couldn't. It wasn't until about a month after he left i realized what he was doing to me i was constantly bitchy and impatient and my marriage was in major trouble because I was so run down and unhappy. 19 month olds should not be breast fed or co-sleep in a bed that's weird. She's teaching him horrible habits and she does need help.|`|63a7abd045cc49ddeb43e136e6b00d67aa	Honestly I think you should just tell your friend you can't watch him anymore. The baby is going to cry for her until the mom comes back and until the mom changes her situation, the baby won't change.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I would tell her its too much for you to handle right now.<br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't be feeding him or holding his cup for him.  He's old enough to do it himself and if he chooses not to he will be the hungry/thirsty one.|`|Jswomud7aa	The first priority is YOUR baby. If babysitting your friend's toddler is getting in the way of parenting your own child then you should stop babysitting. <br>  <br>  Second of all, unless asked, you should not give parenting advice to anyone, including your friend. Unless she seeks out your opinions on her parenting style and skill, just let her be. Have a polite conversation with her letting her know that her baby is disruptive towards your household and is interfering with your own parenting and unfortunately you can not watch him for long periods of time any more.<br>  <br>  I would say you should let her know that if she needs you to babysit for a few hours like once or twice a week that would be fine, but nothing on a regular and/or permanent basis.<br>  <br>  It is not your obligation to teach or parent your friends child. She is his mother and will decide what is best for him. If you get in the middle of that you are bound to loose a friend.<br>  <br>  I just wanted to add that I'm sure she and her husband have problems beyond the scope of their child and you shouldn't pass judgment because you do not know the intimate details that go on between husband and wife. <br>  <br>  I strongly believe that people will continue just doing what then want, however wrong it may be, and will not listen to good sound advice unless they actually reach out for it. If they don't and you give them advice you will only end up with resentment.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Usually around 18 months or so, a child goes through a second phase of "separation anxiety". His screaming and crying for his mom when she leaves is probably perfectly normal, especially if she is a stay at home mom and he's never really been away from her. My youngest sister was like this and we could NEVER leave her in a nursery or with another baby sitter. It was hard, but she grew out of it. I breastfed my baby till she was 2 but I still had her feed herself, etc. I would say, if he wants you to feed him and hold his sippy cup, simply refuse. Eventually, he will do it himself because he will get thirsty and hungry enough. You will just have to put up with the crying for a while until he gets the picture. <br>  <br>  Something else to keep in mind...if his parents are going through a divorce, this could be having a very traumatic effect on him and may be the cause of some of his behavior.
CdJtH0xdaa	I don't think age factors into the decision AT ALL. If you are ready to have a child, and by ready, I mean you have a stable relationship, are financially stable, have a good home, and have a job or two, then you can raise a child. I also feel that this all applies to whether or not you're ready to have sex or not; if you are ready to have sex, you *need* to be ready for what might happen.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I think that older people are more equipped to raise a family because in most cases they can better provide for the child financially, they are more mature, and frankly can teach a child more about life. I also think that married people are more equipped than single people. I have a cousin who is a young single parent and she works very hard, she's in college, and she spoils her son to death too. But there's still something missing. I think what's missing is life skills. She knows nothing about keeping a home clean so her house is a mess, she has her son around lots of questionable people (his father being one of them), and the kid lacks discipline. I think if she were older, she'd be able to make better choices. In some ways, she still acts like a teenager, though I commend her for trying so hard.|`|AA11946005	Some people would say that you, as a young mother, did not get to experience certain things because you were caring for a child.  If you had postphoned having a child till, say twenty something, you might have gone away to college, travelled across country, or done a whole host of things you couldn't because you were committed to your child.  Granted you can do those things later, when your child is older but you cannot recaputure your teenage years which some people believe should be exclusively yours.|`|QkMyhHkaaa	I think that the choice of timing that a woman starts a family has changed because times have changed. Alot of woman would rather "establish" their career first for personal reasons and this gives them something to fall back on when they are ready to return to work.<br>  From what I have seen, men seem to be more "ready" to undertake being a parent when they are of an older age. Alot of men have been quoted as saying ...that they have more time (and maturity) for (this) child as opposed to my previous one(s) when they were fully comitted to their careers (and needs).
prqrQcd1aa	Honestly, I think the best option is to just throw them all away and tell him that there will be no more pacifiers. He may toss and turn for hours but you will save yourself a lot of head aches in the long run with dental bills and so on!|`|mgiJVjaKaa	If he just needs it for sleep, have him pick out a new big kid "comfort item" for his bedtime routine. Tell him in order to get it, he has to trade in his pacifier, but he can have his comfort item every night. You can look at things like cool lamps that put stars on the ceiling, teddy bears, a particular stuffed animal he might really like, etc.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Get rid of it and accept the fact he may be upset for a bit and cry like crazy, but lickity split before you know it...with a couple days, he will have forgotten about it...did this with all our chidlrens things like blankies, sooters, bottles, breastfeeding.  Children adapt very easily...adults don't so don't think about how you might feel if someone just took your bottle or smokes or soemthing like that away...it isn't the same for children.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Just throw them all away and pretend they never existed or your son will grow up to look like Bart Simpson's classmates.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	throw it in the garbage|`|uxItOSkmaa	Huh?<br>  You'd rather let him whine, toss & turn for HOURS than let him have a pacifier to fall asleep. I don't get the logic there. <br>  Get all pacifiers out of his reach and only let him have have one for sleeping.  Slowly work on replacing that comfort item with another so he doesn't have to whine himself to sleep.|`|uLLQovSyaa	I read one time where you could slowly start cutting some of it off a little at a time till there was nothing left but I don't know if it works.My kids didn't really take to a pacifier but I wish they would have if it had cut down on the whining.lol! I'm glad they didn't much suck their thumb though! Unless you can just tough it out till he gets over it?Good Luck!|`|iwUInpC1aa	You should not have started it in the first place. I never used one with my child when she was a baby.<br>  <br>  The reason most people resort to using them is to keep the baby from crying. <br>  <br>  This is wrong! Better for you and the baby to know the reason for the crying and cure the situation.|`|lHjXeN8oaa	i saw on super nanny that they left the pacifiers for the "passy fairy" or something like that... they simply put all the pacifiers in a ziploc and the "fairy" exchanged them for a big kid toy.  :)  just an idea.  :)|`|16827288a6ef61faf9d2e2c99f7102edaa	just throw all the pacifiers away. he will learn 2 live without it.|`|JN7bJ5vMaa	rip it out of his mouth|`|BCDoxkE1aa	hot sauce|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Take him to the baby store and have him "donate" his pacifiers into their collection box (trash can) for the new babies.
4UJPRrrpaa	healthplans.bebto.com - here is my health insurance plan. As I remember they can provide such a service.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	You should not have a problem switching insurance. If you are pregnant on one the other will take you since you were already insured. You would not be able to stay on your fathers insurance since you will be married.|`|v3LnJycKaa	nope and most will allow you to go on as a partner now, knowing a marriage is occuring soon, also if yu already have insurance it is generally a smooth transisition|`|wr78BCGAaa	i doubt that pregnancy would affect you switching.. but are you sure that your new husband would be able to add you right away?<br>  <br>  some insurance companies make you wait for a period of time before they will add anyone else to a policy.  when i got married, my husband had to wait a whole year before he could add me so i had to get medicaid from the state to cover my second pregnancy.<br>  <br>  have your fiancee ask the human resources dept. at work.|`|28fNd725aa	Pregnancy is always cover'd minus and deductibles or copay that you may have. But pregnancy can not be deemed like preexisting, if that's what you are thinking!!  Once you are married you will not be able to stay of your dad's insurance so a switch will be mandatory!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|VEkkn2Otaa	it just depends on his insurance some will say its a preexisting condition but most wont and should be covered!
uFrqC4Y2aa	There is a chance there but it's pretty slim. Any change in birth control can cause problems.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	High.|`|KTbo7dWlaa	When you come off anything it will change the way you have your period. Try to relax, and take a test in a week or so. You said that you got your period on the 21st and finished on the 24th that 3 days you had your period not one day. If you keep thinking that your pregnant then you will feel that way, its your mind messing with you. Try to relax your body and like i said take a test in a week or two and go from there. Next time don't have unprotected sex and then you want have to worry. Good Luck!!!|`|RPoFBenJaa	my question to you is: Why in the world would you have unprotected sex only to then have to take the Morning after pill THEN have unprotected sex again. The Number of times you have written "unprotected sex" is proportionate to the ridiculousness of your question.|`|LzJJn1m7aa	If your really that worried about being pregnant STOP having unprotected sex haha!!!! its not that hard tosay no!!! if you keep this stuff up you will become pregnant then you will really be in trouble. Control yourself=)
eJMIazhLaa	Yes, I like it.|`|c3CVY87caa	I'm not that crazy about Max... maybe David Alexander?  Michael Alexander?

a4bd96dcb7b6c4b2e1b26176b088b451aa	Have you been to the doctor to check why you haven't been having your period.  I fI were you I would do so.  I guess you haven't been though since by now after seven months you would have already known if you are pregnant from your doctor visit.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Are you saying that you might be 7 months pregnant? You would start to feel "kicking' around 5 or 6 months but not sooner. Why haven't you gone to the doctors?|`|M89CyJLHaa	Unfortunately, I'm a bit like that. I have naturally incredibly irregular periods. I can go up to a year without one. (Before I'm knocked at, I have been to multiple doctors who all tell me there's nothing wrong with me.)<br>  Also, even with these irregular periods, I got pregnant the first time I had unprotected sex.<br>  It is very possible to get pregnant with irregular periods, and you may very well be. See a doctor for a blood test to best determine. :)<br>  <br>  Edit- As for the 'kicking and cravings', if you're anxious that you may be pregnant, you're brain can trick you into experiencing these symptoms. I had the same thing going on last week because I thought I may be pregnant again, but a doctor's test determined it was false.|`|058cbe8f080311800ecccf5877b18677aa	It seems strange that you would be feeling nauseas this late, most of the time this happens in the 1st trimester, it makes me think it might be in your head a little bit.  At 7 months you should be showing BIG TIME, i am 7 months and there is no doubt that I'm pregnant when you look at me.  I would definitely go to the doctor asap.|`|8h5OYw4Haa	If you were far enough along to feel kicking then you would definitely have a positive test. If you are not menstruating, then chances are, you are not ovulating. I would definitely speak to your Dr. if you are trying to conceive and are not having regulated periods.|`|F9pAWBG9aa	why havent you had a pd in 7 months and did you call a doctor about that. yeah you are probably prego! GO TO A DOCTOR NOW!
Qfq4lpe7aa	Just have faith, that is about all you can do!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	there is no real way of knowing till you get the ultrasound. but some good signs are your not bleeding or doubled over in pain from cramps. as long as your not bleeding or cramping real bad everything should be ok. but everybody is different so dont quote me on this stuff lol. we all worry that something might be wrong when we are first pregnant. this is my 5th pregnancy and im still a worry wart lol.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	I feel the same like you too because I'm about 4-5 weeks pregnant too with my third child. I worry about my baby's health too but remain optomistic.Your baby should be fine if the doctor say so unless something happen like they say. You don't have to worry too much unless you start to have cramps that last at least 3 hours or longer or you starting spotting then you should call you doctor immediately. I have spottting early in with second child and have to go to the doctor to get my blood drawn to check if my HCG level goes up every two day until it reach 2000 so I can have an ultrasound to see if my baby is in my uterus. I was scare that I will have a misscarriage but everything turn out fine and my baby is healthy.
1S7uXsInaa	I have a little room vac. . .$20 or something like that, that I have been letting my daughter use to help me vacuum.

Its awesome, and the kids like watching it.  <br>  <br>  Id just not fight this battle with the big vaccuum. And go with the Roomba - did I mention its awesome.  I should change my avatar name to Roomba.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	for about a week or two my son was scared of the sound of the vacuum and I just kept vacuuming when he ws awake and in the room to show im it was okay and he got over it..maybe get her a toy vacuum so she can "help" vacuum that house and then let her explore the big vacuum and let her help you vacuum with that one too.|`|wPT33kEUaa	my nephew use to do the same, so we got him his own little one that you use batteries in and it helped him get over it now he loves the vacuum cleaner|`|sRjURY43aa	I tell her doctor next time.

xy0xHn7oaa	My doctor actually said that the vagina is like elastic, it stretches, but it comes back into it's original size.  No worries there.  But my doctor actually stitched me up tighter than before with my first one.  My husband could tell a BIG difference.  Good luck!! :)|`|RzaP9bQmaa	The vagina is one of the most elasticated part of your body, and it will go back to the size that it was before you gave birth.  If you are worried that it won't you can always do your pelvic floor exercise. In fact you can even start doing them now, its never too early to start.  If you don't know how to do them or you have never heard of them, it's really easy to do, it's like when you go to the toilet and you  can stop the pee in mid-flow. That is was pelvic floor exercise are. <br>  <br>  You don't have to do them on the floor you can do them anywhere, I use to do them when I was sitting on the bus. Thats the best thing about them no-one can tell when you are doing them.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	It stretches for a bit, but goes back to normal quickly.  In fact my husband and I both agree that sex is better now then before I had our children.|`|3oSQQt6maa	It goes back to the natural size. I feel sex the same as i did before my two kids.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	If you do kegels you will be the same after, most people are even better.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The vagina is very elastic.  It goes back to how it was before the baby was born.  In some cases its actually tighter!|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Its different for everyone.  For most it will just stretch back down to pretty much normal within a couple months.
ApyrV5J9aa	At first I took 50mg on day 5-9 after using Provera to start my period. After 2 cycles like that my doctor quit Provera and started me on 750mg Metformin twice a day to start my period. At that point I started having regular periods and no longer needed Provera. I was on the Metformin/Clomid combination for 6 cycles, going up to 200mg of Clomid by the end. I got pregnant on my second round of Metformin 1500mg and Clomid 200 mg and IUI. I have not heard of too many people using Metformin and Provera at the same time. I'm guessing the doctor is trying to get you in a regular cycle so once he accomplishes that I would think he would take you off of the Provera. It is a steroid and can cause side effects if taken long term. Best of luck to you!|`|wom2ER4Baa	HI iam on the same routine as u have.I am in metformin and clomid and provera to induce the period.This is my first moth and im on CD 7 taking clomid.I too have heard of both sucessful story as well as unsucessful.So dnt worry let have hope on God and everything happens for good.All the best.|`|D2Xam3POaa	I took Metformin, Provera and Clomid and got pregnant....so, yes it does happen!  I don't remember the exact dosages of the Metformin and Provera, but I got pregnant on 100 mg of Clomid.  Good luck to you!|`|fMilDRgLaa	I got preggo with 150 mg. of clomid and took 10 mg. of Provera.  I didn't have to do the metformin.  It took 3 months and the clomid had to be adjusted from 100 mg. to 150 mg. for me.  The second month at 150mg. worked. Good Luck!|`|7iMZ91K7aa	I am currently on round 2 of Provera and Clomid... No baby yet, but I am keeping a positive outlook! Good luck to you and your future pregnancy!!
98WKYtfwaa	I got my MATB1 form today, it's just a slip of paper, your midwife signs and dates the front and you put your name and address on the back, that's all.<br>  <br>  In the letter, you should include your name, address, dob, your babys expected due date, a contact number for you, when you want to take your maternity leave and when you intend on going back along with your employers details.

T0gv52CDaa	I know all the books say that breast feeding should never hurt if you are doing it correctly, but they lie.  I've yet to meet any mother who didn't think it hurt for the first 3-4 weeks.  That being said, I promise you that if you stick it out for another two weeks, your nipples will be so tough that nothing will hurt them, and breastfeeding will become the wonderful and rewarding experience you were expecting it to be.  I remember wanting to give it up when I was at the point where you are with my first son.  The only thing that stopped me was that I come from a family of breast feeders, and my circle of friends are all breast feeders too, and I would have been too embarrassed to tell them that I was giving my child formula.  When I hit week three, a miracle happened.  He latched on that morning, and it didn't hurt.  That was the happiest day I'd had since he was born.  I went on to nurse him until he was 13 months old without a problem or a regret.  With my 2nd son (now 3 1/2 months) it took until 4 weeks before it stopped hurting, but I made it through because I remembered from my first son that the pain doesn't last forever, and the rewards are too great to pass on.<br>  <br>  Hang in there, and don't use the nipple gaurds.  Everyone that I know who has used them ended up with cracked and bleeding nipples and just gave up breastfeeding all together.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  It really is worth it.|`|kuHE3z2Maa	I had the same experience when my son was nearly a month old, and I just couldn't take the pain anymore and switched to formula. Whether you breastfeed or offer formula, your baby will thrive, so don't feel guilty if you can't continue breastfeeding. Breastfeeding just isn't for everyone. The fact that you tried shows that you are a loving Mom.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for you.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	I have a few friends that have used the sheilds and said they were a life saver - good luck!  Maybe pump sometimes in between, and bottle feed, to give your nipples a break from the baby<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|791NVofcaa	first off, find a support group near you. La Leche League is everywhere and most hospitals have lactation consultants and nursing workshops. a deep latch is KEY to pain free breastfeeding. if your son only takes the nipple. immediately take him off and get him to re-latch. as soon as his mouth gets really wide, quickly "shove" him on. i say shove because you have to be quick and a little forceful. just no so much that you stun the little guy. he should get most of the aerola. and again...if he doesn't get a deep latch, take him off and try again. the pain should subside in a few days if you correct the latch. and contact the support group asap! they will be a huge help.|`|ZnXyIQKlaa	Please call the hospital where you had your son and speak with a lactation consultant, where I live you can go see them for free!  I had latching issues with my 4 month old son once we came home from the hospital, I got engorged and had horribly cracked nipples.  I was in so much pain, I almost gave up but was advised by his ped. to see the lactation consultant.  It helped me out.  She did give me a nipple shield to use, it helped me to heal up, but you must be careful using it or your baby may only nurse with it on, so my advice is to call the consultant.  Please don't give up, I am still nursing my son at 4 months and it is the most rewarding thing.  It gets better!!!  Good luck!|`|87d8aafbd195fc80b4d30f12e7539f3faa	Dont give up!! <br>   <br>  My son was born this last Dec, and around 2 weeks my nipples were on fire, they hurt so bad, but then one day, it stopped. Give it more time, I promise it's worth it.|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	Breastfeeding hurt me too at first.  You know how they say that if it hurts your baby isn't latched on correctly?  That's a total lie.  If you've had a lactation consultant confirm your latch on, the pain should stop soon.  By the time I'd been doing it for a month, the pain completely went away.  Taking baths to relax just before feeding helped me, as did eating "comfort food" (for me it was fruit parfaits).  The more stressed/scared you are about feeding the more it seems to hurt.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I never tried the nipple shields.  HTH
rRkPNKteaa	I know your pain, I was sick for the first three months...and I don't know why they call it morning sickness because it is constant!  <br>  <br>  The few things that helped were definately the ginger ale, saltines, fresh air, and preggy pops.  Preggy Pops were a big life saver (you can get them at babiesRus), I think I had one in my mouth 24 hours a day!  Good luck and happy pregnancy!!|`|61e43026c2296d0395ca66a2a1b35b79aa	Sadly nothing helped me but medication. I ended up losing 12lbs by the time I was 9 weeks because I just could not eat with out puking or dry heaving for long periods of time. It came to the point that my doctor had to give me Zofran to help so I could eat because of the danger with the weight I was loosing - ugh not to mention that I had to have an IV to get hydrated because even water wouldnt stay down. Talk about extreme morning sickness...scratch that all day sickness... Zofran didnt cure it but it made it possible to eat toast and crackers. Couldnt do the ginger ale thing because of the carbonation. Just stick to foods that are light and pretty bland. Hopefully you wont have to be put on meds like I was... I hated the idea of taking anything.... <br>  Good luck!!|`|8a949c7984d501f70f4b690183ae5920aa	toast helps me.  Sips of water.sleep|`|cjqOUq5xaa	Saltine crackers and Sprite or Ginger Ale! I know what your going through-but mine lasted all day! Crackers will become your best friend! Also soft juicy fruits were good! But just hang in there it will get better!
uFrqC4Y2aa	It recently started hurting for me too. Then yesterday I spotted after a brisk walk.<br>  <br>  ADD: It could be the dialation or try using lube. I didn't think of that. I've been using it since I was around 10 weeks because I was uncomfortable. That improved things A LOT.|`|01vMpHkWaa	uhm not usually so early<br>  it hurts for me right now because im dilated<br>  <br>  EDIT: then thats why it hurts...mystery solved lol be careful with sex. it can start labor if your dilated already|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It hurt a lot in the beginning for me (1st 12 weeks)..I'd cramp up after.  Then the hurt stopped and the bleeding started.  Now I'm okay at 19weeks but I'm sure it'll come back a little tough at times.|`|MtU2yH3gaa	I'm pretty sure its normal. It happened to me as well. A lot of time what happens when your pregnant is your hormones are so crazy that you dont have enough lubrication like you would normally have, which in turn makes it very uncomfortable to have sex. I would suggest more lube?! And sometimes its just because you arent in the mood, so it hurts. Anyway, good luck, and if you are really worried about it, just give your dr. a call!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I'm 30 weeks pregnant and sex hurts afterwards.|`|4U3K1Elaaa	YEAH ITS NORMAL... lol. um just use moer lube..
4RjM5lElaa	well, you're limited if you cannot sew well....what about Yoda from StarWars?  You could put him in a green onesie with long sleeves, find a green hat and attach some funky ears - it will be easy for you t change him should he need a diaper change and it won't restrict him so he will not get annoyed with that.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
JvZY0ZS4aa	Because you're a US citizen, there should be no problems getting your babies paperwork. However, this doesn't mean it will be quick or frustration free. <br>  <br>  My sister went through a similar situation but she's a South African citizen. The same rules apply though. After giving birth the hospital will give you a card or certificate of sorts to validate the birth of your child. This is not their official birth certificate, but if you don't get this card, you won't be able to apply for the birth certificate. (My sister's doctor refused to give her this card until all the medical bills from the birth were paid in full)<br>  <br>  You'll then take this card to the Registro Civil office and register your baby's birth and apply for the birth certificate. Your baby will automatically be a Mexican citizen regardless of your nationality. <br>  <br>  If you want to change this, you have to also register the baby's birth in the US, which will end up giving the baby dual citizenship. You'll need their official birth certificate from Mexico to do this (check and make sure what additional requirements may be needed - my sister was required to get the birth certificate apostealed [sp?] for the South African consulate to acknowledge it).<br>  <br>  What's involved in doing this will likely depend on what part of Mexico you're in. My sister gave birth in Rosarito (Just across the San Diego, US border by Tijuana) in 2002. Registering the birth involved sitting in an overcrowded waiting room with lots of parents, kids and babies. We were lucky enough to have someone there who spoke English, but don't count on this being available. <br>  <br>  The waiting time to go pickup the certificate wasn't too long - perhaps a week or so? (memory fails me at this point). The biggest problems you could have will be waiting, having a bit of a run around if they direct you from one person to the next and possible language barrier. These simply need some patience and understanding going into it. Otherwise there should be no problem.<br>  <br>  After years of dealing with paperwork between several countries, the best piece of advice I can give you, is to keep everything! Any piece of paper, form or document you're given could be essential to the process and they won't care about your ignorance or lack of knowledge on the matter if you don't have it. <br>  <br>  Also, it often comes down to 'luck of the draw' in who you get to deal with your paperwork. Some officials are knowledgeable and helpful, others are not. Some are happy dealing with foreigners, others are not. Pray you get to deal with a good person.<br>  <br>  I hope things go well for you. My congrats on the baby and condolences regarding your grandma. Maybe she'll surprise you all and still be alive for the birth and get to meet her great-grandchild before her end!|`|FH2iKFcJaa	If you are a citizen then you will have no problems with the baby.|`|v3LnJycKaa	if you and the father are us citizens then the baby will be a us citizen if you were only visiting, you did not move out of state... <br>  <br>  you shoul dbe fine, contact the local INS department and ask them
7YTiooX5aa	Yes if you have a blood test done it will come back positive if you are pregnant.|`|6zPCQ7rPaa	give it some time.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I would assume that it would be too early to test positive even if you are pregnant.  You will need to wait until you have missed your period for the pregnancy test to be accurate.
VDwHFW57aa	I keep a lidded bucket next to my toilet so I can just toss the soiled liners in and let them soak until I'm ready to do laundry. A little squirt of castille soap (like Dr. Bronners) or oxygen bleach helps a lot. If you're somewhere sunny you can let the sun naturally whiten your liners. Truth is though, all re-usable diapers will have some amount of staining. Comes with the territory. At least the snap-in liners are nestled inside the cute pants!|`|K0iz8g5baa	did you try sun bleaching them? I have done that with other cloth diapers, I just wash them and lay them out in the sun.|`|MTvjvVY0aa	I have to agree the stains are VERY difficult to get out.  We also have just learned to live with it.|`|nFQSTaRvaa	no|`|b7329aa7a50c45d2073625da82916595aa	I have tried everythingng scrubbinging them with baking soda, spray and wash, you name it I've tried it, you just learn to live with the stains.
AA10880314	The pill will be enough if you have been taking them properly. He won't have to pull out. They are nearly 100% effective. <br>  <br>  You might want to use the condom just in case of STD's anyways at your age tho. You really can't be sure of Anybody unless they have been recently tested.<br>  <br>  Use a condom for a looooong time til you sure of your partners health and trustworthyness. Although, you can still get HPV through a condom.  HPV is genital warts, which causes cervical cancer. <br>  <br>  I would say pregnancy is the least thing for you to worry about.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	It's like .1%, assuming you use the birth control completely and totally accurate.<br>  <br>  I used the pull out method and wasn't on birth control, no accidents. I wouldn't recommend it though.<br>  <br>  What birth control are you using? If it's the pill, you should be taking it regularly and consistently so that it's as effective as possible. I have the Implanon implant so I don't worry about the pull out method, he can ejaculate in me (I am completely prepared for that .1% fail rate though).|`|jCB7S6sfaa	YES!!!do not do this method because i was stupid when i was your age and me and my boyfriend of 2 years did that and now we have a two year old.Please do not do it. Even though you are on birth control you shouldn't take the chance.|`|lkJ1M01Uaa	Yes, there is still a small chance.  Tell him no condom, then no sex.  If he doesn't accept this then he is too immature to be having sex.  <br>  <br>  Be responsible and don't risk it.|`|TV1Fvhfxaa	No. Go ahead.|`|IDcsVCuLaa	there's a .1% chhance.<br>  dont risk it.|`|IAzCsvaNaa	there is a chance. but just make sure u take the pill everyday at the same time and u should be fine|`|l1STgPyRaa	if you do let him do that enjoy being a mom|`|WaFSWd62aa	I have a friend that was born when her dad used a condom and her mother was on birth control. And stuff comes out before a guy even pulls out and ppl have gotten pregnant like that before too. Not only can you get pregnant but you can also transmit STDs that way, my advice is before you start having sex. you should both get tested, and when you do decide to have sex you need to keep taking your birth control and he needs to use a condom.|`|USoSsng6aa	If you are using your birth control correctly, then there is a very, very low risk you will get pregnant, even if he ejaculates inside of you.<br>  <br>  That said, there is still a risk of pregnancy (although small) and there is still the risk of STDs, so it's your call.<br>  <br>  Shame on the folks making fun and saying bad things, they must not have read the bit where you're on birth control.|`|UZKfRM8naa	YES. Even with a condom or birth control, there is a chance. There is always a chance. But pulling out is a horrible method. Make sure you are taking your pill every morning and always use a fresh condom.|`|dWcgsOgIaa	Hello.<br>  <br>  Let's talk about this for a minute, okay? <br>  <br>  There has been research done by the National Institute of Health that showed that there is no sperm in pre-ejaculate. Without the presence of sperm, fertilization cannot occur. The risk, though is this: sometimes men begin to ejaculate before the nerves down there send the signal to the brain that ejaculation is occurring. So, he will continue to penetrate you until he gets the signal saying, 'Oh Oh - time to pull out'. In the mean time, sperm-dense ejaculate has been released inside you, putting you at risk for pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you two can use some other method of birth control, since he probably has it in his mind that he 'hates' the feel (or lack thereof) of condoms. Speak with your gynecologist or pediatrician. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  Jess Me|`|exMPHWKHaa	No there's no way that it would happen. You should go off birth control too because the pull out method is guaranteed to not get you pregnant. I think girls like you are so retarded no one should ever give you birth control. Learn how to spell "want" you idiot.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	yes there is a chance. use condoms and stay on birth control.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	YES THERE IS A CHANCE. Even if you use a condom and birth control, there is a possibility of pregnancy. The pull-out method is no where near effective. A guy produces pre-ejaculate (which contains sperm) as a natural lubricant during the course of sex. So, because of that, if you have any sex without a condom, there will be a small amount of ejaculate inside of you.<br>  <br>  Explain to him that the method isn't safe. He should understand.|`|hGY08GjRaa	YES..<br>  <br>  Birth control is not 100%<br>  <br>  You want as close to 100% as you can get<br>  The Pill + COndoms+ spermicide (many condoms contain spermicide)<br>  <br>  THAT is the only thing that will give you a pretty close to 100% chance of not getting pregnant<br>  <br>  People who use the pull-out method have two names<br>  1. Morons<br>  2. Parents<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously.. any guy that is too "macho" to use a condom is really immature and not really a man... a REAL man who REALLY cares about you would be happy to use a condom and do everything he can to protect you against an unwanted pregnancy.<br>  <br>  no glove, no love!!<br>  <br>  Think about STDS too.. BC doesn't prevent that, only condoms do.. how do you know for SURE you are his "first" He could be lying...he sounds like the type who would (if he's selfish enough to want to not use condoms) IF he's slept with someone else,  and you sleep with him, you are also essentially sleeping with everyone else he's slept with, and everyone THEY'VE slept with.. bad idea to risk.. <br>  <br>  it is NEVER safe to not use a condom, until you are MARRIED and don't mind too terribly much if you DO get pregnant...<br>  <br>  Tell him no glove no love and if he doesn't want to comply, dump his sorry butt.. he doesn't care about you and he's  not a man.. (I'd almost say that was true just from his ASKING you to have unprotected sex)|`|BkdZq0QPaa	yes, theres precum which has sperm in it and birth control isnt 100% effective<br>  its ok by itself but its far safer with condoms|`|zdGpaFlfaa	each and every time u have sex u risk a chance to get knocked up.

ghmwZtFraa	In a normal pregnancy, the hCG level will double every 48 - 72 hours. Don't read too much into having too much of hCG numbers. The results from an ultrasound after 5 - 6 weeks gestation are much more accurate than using hCG numbers. A high level of hCG can mean twins, or it can mean you're further along than you realize, or a molar pregnancy. Also, you may just have gotten an innaccurate reading and should retest after 48-72 hours.|`|VBma10tyaa	WOW thats crazy! you could very well be having twins! but as long as the levels keep going up your fine, its when it drops that you have to be worried good luck nad congrats!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	if you found out you were pregnant 3 weeks ago, and now you are 4 weeks pregnant, that's impossible, you dont actually get pregnant until week 2, then 2 weeks later ( the time your period is due) is often when you find out, making you 4 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  you count from the first day of your last period, and thats how far on you are|`|wFe7L1XJaa	its gonna go up and up and up for a while you'll just have to wait and see

If you are having the thought process of "I thought this is how they all act..." then your child likely does not have it.<br>  <br>  I spent some training time in a special education room.  There was a Kindergartner with ADHD and there was absolutely no mistaking it for "how children typically act."  No mistaking it.  And I'm with you after that experience...I believe many children are misdiagnosed.|`|CxCigxZIaa	2 options:<br>  Lie and tell her that the Dr. said she was a normal ACTIVE 4 year old. <br>  It's hard to get the news that your child is ADHD and when you do .. you feel like you want to SAVE THE WORLD - by helping mom's with kids that 'might' be a bit more active than they think they should be. <br>  IF you don't want to lie then just let her know HOW you really feel. Let her know that she isn't to say things like that again. Period..you are sick, sick of it. IF your child is ADHD then what you do is YOUR option. Not hers.<br>  <br>  Put the emphasis back onto to HER child. Ask her questions about what she's doing...she will be MORE than willing to talk about it.|`|cA3DDRGraa	My personal opinion about ADD or ADHD is that it is a medical term for bratty kid. It also gives the parent an excuse to let their kids keep behaving badly.<br>  <br>  gram|`|ThnKiLfTaa	Hi, I think your absolutely right! ALOT of kids are wrongly diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. When in fact some kids problems are simply behavioral issues from bad parenting. Now don't get me wrong, there are also some kids that truly do have ADD/ADHD and do need to be on medication. <br>  I think it is difficult to diagnose a child as young as 4yrs old, simply because a 4yr old is not going to have an extended attention span and they are going to be hyperactive. I think in children that young, for 1. there needs to be an extensive evaluation done and I would most likely get a 2nd opinion. But also for children that young I think you need to try to look beyond the "normal" behavior of a 4yr old and see if their is an excessive amount of hyperactivity or an excessive amount of impulsiveness or an excessive amount of any of the symptoms of ADD/ADHD and also look for anything else that is unusual behavior for a 4yr old. But don't let your Sister push you into having your child put on medication for a disorder that your daughter may not have. Good luck and God Bless!|`|WNn8WDPHaa	at the age of four..they ar ehyper. I was wrongfully diagnosed with ADD\ADHD  they had me on multiple medications for years. and it didn't do me any good. I am sure your daughter is perfectly fine. she is just a 4 year old being hyper an d playful...:) its normal. Honestly, i don't think there is a " disease" such as ADD or ADHD.|`|CGwIBBWAaa	Let's see. Four years old? Runs around a lot, talks a lot, always climbing something, excited about life. Doesn't listen all the time, etc? Am I close?<br>  <br>  Sounds like a normal kid who has a parent who doesn't want to take the hard road of parenting and be CONSISTENT in what they say and do in order to set boundaries. So, instead of teaching when and where it is appropriate to be a kid, parents just drug them up so they are sedate and boring. Later on they will have learning disorders because they have no interest in anything. <br>  <br>  Kids are not miniature adults who are bored with life. Your nephew has only been in this world for 4 years. Everything is new! Why shouldn't he be excitable and curious? When kids want the same book read over and over or eat the same foods over and over, it's to build some comfort because everything is different. It's nice to have some continuity. <br>  <br>  Good luck with convincing your sister that she needs to be a better parent.<br>  <br>  add edit:<br>  <br>  I'm not implying in my post that you are being a bad parent, but that the misdiagnoses gives some parents excuses to not parent. If your sister's kid TRULY has a problem (I hope she got more than one second opinion) then she just needs to deal with her situation. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Tell your sister that until she gets her doctorate degree where she is qualified to diagnose you will continue relying on the advise of her doctors who are developmental specialists and actually qualilfied to make diagnoses<br>  <br>  I have a son dx with ADHD, he is 2.5 yrs, and was dx at 2.  He is not aggressive at all, he's impulsive, and climbs alot, we just deal with it.  No meds until absolutely necessary, oh sure the neurologist wanted to put him on clonidine for it, we said no.<br>  <br>  I do believe ADD/HD is real, but don't feel that medication is the first intervention, actually its the last.

Never, 2. Rarely. 3. Sometimes. 4. Often. 5. Constantly.<br>  <br>  My child fidgets, moves his hands and feet, and can't seem to stay focused during tasks that take time. 1. Never, 2. Rarely. 3. Sometimes. 4. Often. 5. Constantly.<br>  <br>  <br>  These are just two questions out of...I believe close to 50. But make an appointment with your child's pediatrician and in the very least, you'll take the survey for no reason. Good luck.

DDYwnut6aa	Checking your cervical position sounds like something only taught to doctors and nurses, but there’s no reason you can’t learn how.  Those who are telling you you need a speculum, that a Dr. should do it, etc. simply haven't been educated in this area.  It's your body, you can do it.<br>  <br>  First, wash your hands very well. Find a comfortable position that will allow you to easily reach your cervix. That may be sitting on the toilet, putting one leg up on the edge of the bathtub or squatting.  Reach your index or middle finger inside of your vagina, and slowly (don’t scratch yourself!) slide your finger in as far as you can reach, a sort of in and upward motion. If you’re not close to ovulation, you should find your cervix easily. If you are ovulating, your cervix may be higher in your body and more difficult to reach.   If you think of your vagina as a hallway, your cervix is the other door at the very end. While your vagina has a sort of spongy feel that gives way easily to pressure, the cervix is like a firm, round dimple. Some say it feels like the tip of your nose when you’re not fertile and like the firmness of your lips when you are fertile — this is what you’re feeling for.|`|AA11878029	you cant.    you need a specialist with a magnifying goggles.

490e4f226b74a4050a4f5768c24d97e9aa	Either way...adoption or abortion. You were a big enough girl to sleep with him, now be a big enough mother to make the right decision for your baby. Be more responsible than him. Don't regret 20 years from now the decision you make now. Better you found out now about him, instead of your baby growing to love him, calling him "Daddy" and then him dumping you and baby.<br>  <br>  It'll be fine. Hugs and prayers you make the right decision for the precious little life growing in you.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	Your answer is really confusing "Put it up for abortion?" Do you mean adoption?

diT2WFfCaa	There is always a possibility of getting pregnant when any semen comes in contact with your vagina.  However, that doesn't mean you need to panic.  The chances are fairly slim, especially if you washed right away.  <br>  <br>  The point of the seminal fluid is both to help propel the sperm into the vagina, and to protect it from the environment of the vagina.  With such a small amount of seminal fluid, the sperm would have a difficult time making their way from the outside of your body all the way through your vagina and cervix and to your fallopian tubes, especially without the help of the propulsion of ejaculation.<br>  <br>  I would suggest, though, since you indicate you are not in a position to have a baby, to see your doctor about contraception options if you plan on continuing to have sex.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes you could get pregnant.

According the listed description "doesn't want women to have fun."<br>  Sorry my kind of fun isn't being treated like a sexual object.<br>  <br>  If a woman wants to devalue herself to calling that fun, then I hope she is content with her lack of self esteem and may it not harm her children.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: It's a 'compliment' or another way of saying you're pretty. How about saying something like, Your hair is lovely, you have a nice smile, I like that outfit, I think you're a beautiful  person. Those are compliments. Saying you are a mother I would like f**k, is demeaning and verges on sexual harassment. Does everything have to be sexual? And many wonder why kids are having sex these days because apparently saying you want to with someone is a friggin compliment?? Get a reality check please and don't complain about the world when you contribute to it like this. Teach young girls what a compliment is and don't let them see their mothers disrespect themselves by letting men pin them as purely sex objects.|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	A feminazi is not necessarily the same as a feminist.<br>  <br>  Webster's Dictionary defines feminazi as "extreme feminist who believes the option of abortion is essential to the political, social, and economic advancement of women.<br>  <br>  Not wanting to be labeled a MILF has nothing to do with being a feminazi.

Just because it indicates that they "Like to phuck and they may be hot enough to be phucked"?<br>  <br>  I don't think so....<br>  <br>  It isn't so much the term it self, but the subtext that I find offensive....and a little bit disappointing that people find it so acceptable to throw around.<br>  <br>  I think we've become WAY too desensitized and our kids will be paying for it.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I get called that, even by my friends, and I just take as being called pretty.

I think MILF if an aspect of some people's personality and it's a valid way to think of yourself. Some people would prefer to never be seen in a way that revolves around something so shallow.

How can someone complain about another persons self-respect?<br>  EDIT** <br>  If you want we can be Nazis together. I will be the breast feeding nazi and you can be the feminazi.

At least attitudes towards women have greatly improved over the last little while, and we can only hope they keep improving.  My biggest pet peeve is when women are broken down into categories the madonnas and the whores, the women that men just want to sleep with but have no respect for, and the women that are "good and pure" and they want to marry, but are ultimately bored by.  I mean neither category is flattering and most.<br>  women are somewhere in between.  <br>  Joe- You're right in the fact that there are lots of derogatory names out there for everyone, it doesn't mean that any of them are ok.

I don’t really take it as that person wanting to f**k me. <br>  <br>  Heck, I’ve called my OWN mother a GILF. I tell her she’s a hot Gramma. I don’t tell her that because I want to bang her.

j2mRop0laa	I absolutely do not buy toys ! lol<br>  I need to get rid of 90% of them as it is.<br>  Plus, they are tapering off toys now.<br>  I would buy a few books for myself and a couple for them and probably end up spending more than my card. lol|`|oP504BtFaa	I would buy something for myself. My girls have enough stuff, and for now they don't need anymore. Plus, I have four daughters, so what can 20 dollars buy me FOUR of? I think I'd buy a new book. I love books :)|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Names in a hat , Winner Takes all|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Buy something for myself.  My son has enough toys and clothes to last him for the next 20 years, lol|`|AA10730513	I had a $25 gift card from Amazon last year. I put it away where I wouldn't think of it much until Christmas. I ended up spending it on the Barbie and the movie my daughter wanted. ...<br>  <br>  In your case ... I would say that if you are fairly financially stable and if your family has all they need, get something nice for yourself :) Of, if you feel a little guilty about that - get something for the "house" (like a lamp or picture frames or candles). Otherwise, put it away until there is something you need.|`|prqrQcd1aa	crap, wish i would have had one a few days ago! I just spend 25.10 on a pair of adidas shoes for my 7 year old, and a rolling pin for myself..<br>  <br>  What ever you choose to do, i always try to get the stuff that is free shipping, and usually you have to spend 25 dollars anywase to get that!|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I'd probably spend it on something the whole family would enjoy, such as dvds! I just purchased a lot of dvds we'd been wanting, from amazon... I bought them used, and they work great!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I'd probably hold onto it until we needed something from there.  It's never very long until something new comes up that needs to be bought right away...|`|TQW5E6olaa	Considering how much I spend on my daughter and the fact that I'm single, I'd spend it on me. I LOVE recency era novels, I could get 5 of them for $25. :)
C1eHfhrHaa	We didn't do any pre p with our dogs to bring our kids home.  We just assumed they would adjust and they did because we are in charge and we say what people and animals come into our house.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	we have 6 dogs ranging from 120 pounds down to 12 pounds. they are great with my 2 year old and i am convinced that they are aware im pregnant again. as for getting the dogs ready for the arrival of my first daughter we never shut them out of her room when we were making the nursery. we left the door open and they all went in and investigated the crib and dresser and rocking chair and blankets and clothes. toys etc. when she was born and i was in the hospital with her, every night when my husband came home he brought the blanket from the hospital and would let them all smell it. when we brought her home i went in first and got all the doggie hugs and kisses out of the way and  believe me sniffed me from head to toe and they could smell her on me. then we brought her in and they gave her the once over and she has been old news ever since.|`|n7qcfWxkaa	When the baby comes home, sit down with the baby and the dog and give attention to both of them at the same time.  That way the dog will associate the baby with being petted and loved, and won't be as jealous.<br>  <br>  At least, I've heard that theory. I never tried it, since I never had kids.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Yeah you would be surprised how sensitive to things like this|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	well, my only suggestion would be - if you are the type of doggy mommy that rolls around on the floor, lets your dog lick your face, and just basically acts like your dog is your 'baby'...especially the puppy...you've created a bad situation to bring a baby into. sorry, its true and i've seen it before. you need to stop that behavior RIGHT NOW. dogs are pack animals, who believe in a pecking order. you need to establish right now that YOU and (eventually) your baby, are first in the pecking order and they are at the end. they don't have to be ignored or mistreated to do this...start establishing NOW what areas are going to be OFF limits when the baby comes..for example, the couch, the babies bedroom, your bed....make them eat from their bowl and don't let them have table scraps from the table, that gives them a false sense of superiority in the family...keep them in their place and they should be fine. you really won't understand this till your little one is here and home, but your baby is going to be SOOOO much more important to you then your dogs, if you don't establish the pack order now, you WILL end up having to get rid of them or put them down. which no one wants to do. good luck.<br>  <br>  eta: i forgot to say that yes, i believe many dogs are able to sense that a woman is pregnant. i had a dog and a cat when i was pregnant with my son and they both new. my dog got very depressed and my cat went nuts. they were my babies till i got pregnant and they got weird...my dog evenutally had to be put down due to illness within a year of my son being born, my cat - i gave away, and they gave her back, cuz she was crazy and started peeing everywhere to get back at the new owners, and i had to put her down too. its a BAD BAD situation to have to get rid of animals you love, right after having a child and your already kind of blue. anyway, also wanted to say that golden retrievers are notoriously great with children and families (re: the above poster) her situation is not unique for that breed, but you are not talking about that breed, so you need to be very very careful with your baby around any kind of dog. my parents had a mutt when my brother had my niece --and at one point this mutt put her whole mouth around my nieces little head - my dad saw it, he said it was like she was trying to tell my dad - that she could eat her and there would be nothing we could do about it. dogs are weird. i wouldn't trust them around a baby. EVER! i would keep a close eye on them and not let them ever be alone. they can be very juelous of someone stealing their attention.|`|sqaey2Siaa	I got a golden retriever puppy when I was around 3 months pregnant with my first son, I was worried about how she would react to the baby when i brought him home b/c lets face it..big dogs like to jump, get wild and sometimes could trample over a small child without trying to hurt them. I was AMAZED when I brought my son home at how calm and loving our golden was towards him, to this day (he is 24 months now) she has never done one thing to hurt him and I know she never would. Of course at first don't leave them in the same room together etc, you will be able to tell from day one if your going to have a problem. Big dogs are the BEST with children. Small dogs however are VERY snappy with kids. Bull mastiffs are suppose to be great with children.(gentle giants) Good luck. They will do just fine.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Just make sure they can handle their ears being pinched and pulled and their tail being bent and pulled and the baby in the food dish. When I was pregnant my dog used to jump up on me all the time and push her front paws on my tummy like she was trying to push my tummy back in because she knew she wouldn't be my only baby. Well she did it again the other day out of the blue. I took a test (not because of that) and I'm pregnant again. So i think they have a good idea. <br>  When you bring the baby home bring a blanket or a piece of clothing with your baby's scent on it in first and let your pets get familiar with the smell and then bring the baby in so they aren't so excited. That's what we did and it worked out great.|`|8h5OYw4Haa	I truly believe dogs do sense when you are pregnant. When I was pregnant with my son, I had 2 dogs that started following me and were always laying with me during my pregnancy. They became very gentile around me.When my son came home, we gave the dogs the blanket he was wrapped in first to get use to his smell. Then while I sat on the couch with the baby, we let the dogs check him out. It was actually pretty cute. One of the dogs would always lay by his crib, or by the bouncer, where ever the baby happened to be like she was watching over him. When the baby would cry, she would stand up and get as close as she could to him as if she was trying to sooth him.GOOD LUCK!|`|AA12305234	This is what we did, when my daughter had her baby girl in January. We brought home a different piece of clothing that the baby had on at the hospital. We brought home the little hat they put on them when they are born, then a baby blanket that was peed on by the baby, then a little shirt. We let the dogs sniff them the days before the baby came home. It was fine when we got home, they just sniffed her and went away. <br>  I would just be careful if the big dog is kinda jealous. Make sure to keep an eye on all of them for a while. My 3 dogs are just fine when other kids come ever, but you can never tell when a new kid shows up.  Good luck.|`|ZuENZiB0aa	dogs are really sensitive to all these things. even if you scream when they come near you are pretend to cry they will move back automatically. just make sure that when you get the baby home you let the baby spend some time with your dogs. make sure that your baby does not pull the tail of the dog.......because you can teach your baby to be nice to your dogs at that age also. <br>        dogs are very smart and sensitive to babies. just make sure that you don't leave your baby alone with the dog too early. until the dog and the baby don't get used to each other don't leave them alone!<br>         trust your dog!|`|a1uoxczTaa	i know people that would use baby dolls to get their dogs used to the baby, also make noises like a baby so they wont be scared or alarmed when u bring the baby home. your dogs might notice something different just because they have a sense about these things. my brothers girl (now wife) had two kids, dogs were just like yours same size and kind and everything. one was a mutt bout that size and one was a mastiff about the other size. they noticed and they adjusted to the baby. they had her grow up with them so they were very loving, protective, and very gentle with her.
hVVALFAPaa	If you are sure the infection is cleared up, then I would think this is a growth spurt.<br>  <br>  Babies usually have a growth spurt at about 12 weeks old. He probably ate a bit more the last few days and is now turning that food into HIM! He may be a bit fussy because growing so fast can be a bit uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Be patient the next few days. Let him sleep when he is tired and eat when he is hungry.|`|b7329aa7a50c45d2073625da82916595aa	My baby did the same thing when she had an ear infection. It will pass but you are going to have a few days of this.|`|4GC0QJ8eaa	my baby has an ear infection right now. he is the same way and acts so different like something is bothering him. you should take your baby to the doctor because if it is an ear infection he will need medicine for that. hope he feels better :) oh and by the way my son's name is caiden, we spell it the same way!!!
LwbwMFX9aa	maybe you can get her a photoshoot and have some proffesional pics done of her showing her how beautiful she is.<br>  <br>  Tell her everyday shes beautiful ( im sure you do ), just lift her up the best you can|`|OuuYoSBeaa	kids are mean, they will find everything and anything to pick on other kids for, from glasses, to different clothing etc...i was picked on in elementary for being to skinny.. you just have to teach your daughter to ignore them and remember that she is who she is and beautifull no matter what. As kids get older, they get more mature and learn to keep there thoughts to themselves. <br>  The more she ignores them, and not react to their comments and pretends she doest care, they will get bored and move on to something else. its hard to deal with mean kids, when you are only a kid yourself... Help build her confidence and it will get better|`|hMF3kg3Baa	I do not have a physically scarred child. But my son is developmentally delayed and ADHD. He has a lot of kids that pick on him. This upsets me too. Kids are just mean at that age. I just talk to him and let him know that I love him. Middle school kids are even worse that Elementary school kids. <br>  Tell her that she will meet people that are her friends. The people that are her friends will not see the burns on her arms. They will see the beauty that she has inside and those people will be her true friends. because i am sure that your daughter is a beautiful child inside and out.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	How horrible... My kids are homeschooled, but I remember how cruel kids can be.<br>  <br>  My daughter has a scar on her leg, from a brown recluse spider bite. It caused an open wound that went almost to the bone... She used to be self-conscious about it, but I told her that almost everyone has scars; some more than others, and that she pulled through! I told her some people are just mean, and don't realize what really matters in life, but that she's an awesome kid, and people love her. :) It doesn't bother her, anymore, and I think she's kind of proud.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your daughter!!|`|4kX61Y97aa	well i think its Absolutely disgusting that a child would say that to someone where is the respect for a fellow person. keep reassuring her that everything will be sorted and it will be ok. i suffered many years of abuse at school 4years of it and for my last year i was sent to a learning centre that regain my confidence ALOT. maybe consider her moving school, it never affected my grades, all the best and i hope everything will be ok<br>  x|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Tell her that those burns are her badges of honor. Have her watch Top Chef too, the host, Padma, has a huge scar on her arm and she makes a point of showing it off.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	That pisses me off and i don even know your daughter lol.  I had burns and scars when i was a kid, still do and yea people would be nosy or tease me about it.  They still are nosy!  Mine was cause of abuse so i never opened up about it, i dont know how your daughte rgot it, but if its seriously just she got a burn by accident i would tell your daughter to open up about it.  Say oh one day the stove burned me (or whatever happend), its no big deal, why are you so obsessed with it?  Or tell her to say: You've never gotten hurt before? ANd the kids will start telling their stories about falling, breaking bones, and maybe that will distract them.  good luck!|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	tell her that the scars make her unique. that the children are jealous because she's special and a survivor. tell her when they say something to just walk away. that the other kids will be more affected by her not reacting than by her getting upset and giving them what they want.remind her how much you love her and that she is beautiful and she will eventually learn to be able to block it out. good luck and hugs to your precious girl.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	They show what shes been through. Tell her to ignore the others and that she should be proud that she went through something terrible and has something to show for it. That not every one can do that and shes special and beautiful.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	She could watch America's next top model? The current season has a lady that was burned in a fire. If she sees someone dealing with something similar,might help her be able to see what she can accomplish,regardless of how she looks.
BzCYQlcuaa	yea you don't need to freeze it, my sister and i use the Chocolate Bunny's actually for her baby shower they had pink bow on the so we thought it would be cute.. and we bought them in feb and used them in may. and they were fine! just keep them in a room where they wont melt. room temp is fine...|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Check the box for an expiration date. It is chocolate,chances are it will last till next June.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	They should be fine!  I would NOT freeze them.  When chocolate is frozen and then thawed, it tends to get a strange, white, chalky film from the wax they use to help form the shape.|`|NNwEuC8paa	They should be fine. Leave them at room tempt though sometimes if you freeze chocolate they get this weird white film over them and taste a little werid. or keep them in the refrigerator in a plastic container! Good luck! And CONGRATS!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I've heard that chocolate stays fresh up to three months without being frozen or anything. I don't think you have to freeze them, just keep them room temp so they won't melt.|`|sqaey2Siaa	They should be ok up until that time. I keep chocolate around my house for awhile before disposing of it.
NbJbZXtGaa	They eat more than my kids. I have two boys (2 yo and 3yo) and they would never eat a whole piece of toast, a whole banana, or 1/2 cup of rice. Maybe 10 bites of whatever we are eating and that's it. I throw away a LOT of food, and I hate it!|`|3F8f1SoQaa	I was always told to start with 1 tablespoon or 1/4 of an adult potion per year of age.<br>  <br>  so for my 3 year old I can reasonably ask him to eat 3/4 of a sandwich, with 3 tablespoons of fruit or veggies.|`|fMilDRgLaa	Sounds like you are doing the right thing. Remember, they WILL let you know if they are hungry. I have 2 toddlers and one eats a bunch...the other eats a lot less...both boys...about  a year and a half apart.  Sometimes they fool me and the one that eats less will eat more than the other one.|`|3e9abhVaaa	As long as they're growing properly and happy, then they're well-fed. Their tummies are much smaller than an adult's. It sounds like they're eating enough. My toddler doesn't eat quite that much, but he's nice and chubby.|`|dfGSYLE3aa	I read the pediatric guide and used the sample menus there.  I found that for meals, I was serving 1/2 cup vegetable, 1/2 cup carbohydrate, and 2-3 tablespoons of protein (meat).  This tended to "fill" the adult plate up nicely.  Now, I don't measure it, I can just see how much is needed by looking at the plate.  So, for my 18 month old, even though I don't dare give her the plate, it provides a nice clean way to make sure she is getting enough food and the right types.<br>  <br>  Same for my 3 year old, really.  She is eating even less than the 18 month old and she is much pickier.
eXsR8Gx5aa	Breastfed about 6 times per day (approx), also offered water with meals but will only drink his bath water at present - nice boy I have!<br>  <br>  I'm with you on juice etc, I don't see the point - I'm a bit the same way with unhealthy snacks - if a baby doesn't know what sweets are how can they throw a tantrum about them in the supermarket? My son has those organic rice cakes flavoured with apple juice & he loves them - don't see why I should offer him something sugar & salt laden "just because". <br>  <br>  I've also tried to offer him baby fennel tea - he drinks it, but only out of my cup - its actually quite nice so, I don't mind hi thinking its mine for now!<br>  <br>  (he's 7 mos by the way)|`|AA11109728	My daughter is 4.  She usually has always had juice with breakfast, milk with lunch and dinner, and water in between if she wants.  She doesn't always finish her drink at her meal, so I leave it in the fridge.  She goes and gets a drink whenever she is thirsty.  I don't see a problem with that, adults do the same thing - if you are thirsty, you get a drink - we don't always drink just with meals!|`|hGNvbC6oaa	Booby milk mainly.  Or orange juice, chocolate milk and the occasional sprite as a treat.<br>  Sometimes he'll drink water, but doesn't really care.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	oh goodness everyone seems to be the expert. A kid will know what she wants when she wants it. Its your duty to be sure she is getting enough of everything. If its water she wants its water she should get. Her likes will change eventually. You do need to some how get a little milk in there. Chocolate or white as long as its vitamin D and A fortified. I see your breast feeding and thats the best kind of milk to give her. If she only wants water thats fine, some kids HATE water. SO your lucky. The more water she drinks the less chance of being dehydrated, crabby, and constipated. Juice has a lot of sugar, natural and not. So that doesnt help in the constipation department. If she is eating a well balanced diet then she is getting all the nutrients and vitamins she needs from that so MAKING her drink something else is not needed. My daughter too is a BIG water drinker. She drinks only milk in the morning and then I make sure to give her yogurt and lots of calcium rich veggies for lunch and supper. She is 2. She rarely likes juices or milks and NEVER NEVER soda. I dont give any of that crap to her.... later in her life she will get enough of that I am sure.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I am the same as you.  I only give my twins water and their milk.  Sometimes I add a little bit of juice to their water but that is about it.  I would never give my twins fizzy drinks or straight juice.  My twins love their water and they never refuse it when I give it too them.  My friends baby who is 17 months just has water also.   I would wait until they are a little bit older then I will start to give them something a bit different.|`|18e6c6ba7e558bb945b46902f7a5f9fbaa	Hi my daughter drinks mainly water or whole milk <br>  but recently ive been buying her munch bunch drinks (yogurt drink) and she loves that as well my daughter drinks at meal times and through out the day when she needs it she is also breastfed twice a day as well morning and night although im cutting out the morning slowly shes 22months. Keep up with the water kids don't need fizzy drinks or anything with sugar in it.|`|RvoKIlrdaa	my brother is 1 year old almost 2 but i remember wen he first became 1 year we gave him his first bottle of juice, wen he waz abit yonger we had interduced him to biscuit and other easy to eat stuff. so now he likes trying new things instead of sticking to sumthng he now drinks pepsi but once a week so that he doesnt go crazy and i think he is interested in discovering stuff wich i love about him|`|xy0W50Lqaa	That's good., you should be pleased your little one will drink water.   It's healthy and won't rot those little teeth. <br>  Who cares whatever everyone else gives their kids? I'd just let them get on with it.<br>  My daughter  (12 months) won't drink water.  I breast feed and she has 1 sippy cup of Heinz baby juice and drinks it throughout the day.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Water is definitely better than juice but she needs milk as well. I give milk with breakfast lunch and dinner and before bed, juice diluted with water for am/pm snacks You are lucky I have tried to give my son water even before he knew what juice was at about 8 months and he wouldn't drink it.|`|fjZeVLOQaa	water is good but she needs milk an a little fruit juice wont hurt|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	she needs milk<br>  my baby drinks milk <br>  water<br>  juice|`|KHZLPldraa	My daughter is 17 months and she has a sippy straw cup that has water in it all day long.  At lunch she gets a cup of juice or her rice milk, and rice milk with dinner.  As far as the water I think we are doing fine.  Children must stay hydrated so they are wrong with the theory of drinks are only at meals and snacks.  They should be able to drink when they are thirsty.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	i have a bottle of water for my daughter out where she can get a drink when she needs one. Just like us baby's do get thirsty. <br>  <br>  I also give my daughter milk, she loves it. apple juice but watered down. and sometimes if i have a milkshake i give her a drink. But my daughter would rather have milk or water and she is 11 months old. <br>  And i am going to try to keep her to that. I give her a drink to have while she is eating also.

U1h6Dntjaa	Well, Kayden is made up and trendy sounding.  Edward is classic and traditional.  They should never ever be paired.  I would drop Kayden altogether.|`|NWEJdpocaa	Kayden Edward sounds really nice...I'm planning on using Liam Edward!|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i like kayden, not keen on edward but it fits together,it sound cute|`|GFzDwIk6aa	I would ommit the Y in Kayden if I were you, or try a different spelling all together. That spelling is very common, and also a little feminine:<br>  Kaden<br>  Caden<br>  Cayden<br>  Kaiden<br>  Caiden<br>  Kaeden<br>  Caeden<br>  <br>  I like Edward as a middle name, as it is strong and masculine enough to cancel out the femininity of Kayden.<br>  <br>  I like Caden Edward.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Caden Edward I like better<br>  Or Kaden Edward<br>  <br>  I am sorry, buy Kayden looks like the way someone will name a girl the  boy name Caden/Kaden to make it look more girlie.  It's just a really dumb trend, but I would think it's a girl, because of the spelling<br>  <br>  I like Zayden Edward|`|GvamTVqAaa	Kayden seems girlie.  I would use Kaden or Caden.  Although realize there will be about 10 other kids in his class with some sort of "Aiden name"|`|Yql4JTKPaa	The name you picked out is perfect I wouldn't change it..your happy with it and your BF is happy with it..<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck with the new little one!|`|NNki7qiFaa	It's a nice name, I like it.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Kayden/Caiden/Cayden/Caden seems to be THE name right now for both boys and girls! (but mostly boys). If you are ok with having your last initial tagged on to your childs name all throughout his school years then yes, its a great name, though I prefer it spelled Caden.<br>  <br>  Here are some similar to Kayden that arent QUITE so comoon and trendy:<br>  Camden<br>  Carson<br>  Keaton<br>  Keagan<br>  Kason<br>  Cale<br>  Cade (though it may be a nickname for all those Caden's)<br>  Hayden (still popular, but not as)<br>  Carden<br>  <br>  Oh... I do really like Edward for the middle name, by the way. It is my boyfriend's middle name so maybe thats why... plus Edward Cullen adds a little charm to it I might add :)<br>  <br>  Congrats on the little boy! Thats pretty early to find out!|`|d6e11chxaa	I love Edward, but not Kayden. All of the Aiden names account for over eleven percent of the boys born last year!

Good luck and let us know what you end up choosing/if you keep Kayden Edward.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like that name.<br>  <br>  Elijah edward<br>  noah edward<br>  kayden michael<br>  jonathan david<br>  timothy kayden<br>  kayden timothy<br>  timothy gage<br>  gage edward<br>  kayden miles<br>  miles kayden<br>  noah oliver<br>  oliver jame<br>  jasper ryan|`|4USD8peXaa	I love the name Kayden, but it seems to be popular these days. At least in Ohio it is. <br>  <br>  I like Bryce Michael, Zachariah Scott, or Zacharee Michael.|`|MIRQscqcaa	Kayden is a really nice name! I prefer the spelling Kaiden though as it is unique. x Corbin Edward is also very nice ! x|`|DhmjLRoUaa	I love Kayden but not Edward<br>  <br>  Kayden James<br>  Kayden Alexander<br>  Kayden Tyler|`|GSEslPnTaa	That is an adorable name!<br>  Kayden is super cute!<br>  I also like <br>  Kayden Michel <br>  but what about spelling Kaydyn... like Kaydyn with a y instead of an e?<br>  just an option that i think is cute (:|`|GQRs83Haaa	Nathaniel Ryan :) My favorite boy name. He can go by Nate, Nathan, Nat, or even Ryan.<br>  <br>  Kayden Edward sounds nice.|`|Lsst29Btaa	loveeeeeee the name Kayden & Kayden Edward isn't bad either, but Kayden is awesome.|`|yNV2kRlbaa	I like Caiden for the spelling, but not terribly fond of Edward...<br>  <br>  Caiden James<br>  Caiden...something with one syllable would sound good|`|ORa2ZNAlaa	Kayden is quite common. I think spelled that way looks very feminine. If you like Kayden Edward, I would suggest Kaden or Caedan, it just seems more masculine!|`|e4e2b4a25d405bbec926275fa608dc53aa	Kaleb Edward sounds better and your child will thank you for it...I'm not a big fan of the -ayden trend going on right now..|`|HzJoUBmuaa	i like kayden<br>  <br>  how about Torian Edward?|`|5ci9IZd2aa	Kayden is a really nice name. I like Bradley too.|`|eJMIazhLaa	So cute!  I love it!|`|SEpO6Qk4aa	I also like the name Kayden.  I am pregnant also and I thought about that name if it was a boy...but it turned out to be a girl...I also think that Rylan Matthew is cute.|`|bt7wCWzWaa	Kayden Edward is nice but I would spell Kayden as either Caden or Kaden since Kayden looks feminine to me.
Ka52nbhNaa	I would call the mom, have her pick up the child and strongly recommend she contact her pediatrician.<br>  <br>  Unless you have seen examples of physical abuse, I would not call CPS first off.  Give the mom a chance . . . especially if this is your only current concern with the child.<br>  <br>  Sometimes mom's miss things - I was shocked when I dropped my twins off at daycare on Monday only to have our daycare provider say to me "Oh, look - Genevieve has her first tooth" - I had not noticed it yet, thought she was teething, but hadn't run my finger along her gum to feel it until she pointed it out.  These things happen . . .|`|kprKXEOSaa	If she's teething she could be chewing on her tongue a little, even while she's asleep.  She could have a food allergy or sensitivity, especially things like nuts can cause sores in the mouth.  <br>  I would probably talk with the mom before CPS.  If it was my child, I would appreciate someone at least bringing it to my attention before calling social services on me.  Give her a chance to get the little girl into a pediatrician first, and go from there.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's foot and mouth disease, it's pretty painful in the mouth and later the blisters will show up on her feet and palms of her hands.|`|m8alP5kPaa	I've seen babys with thrush before and it looked more like a THICK white coating inside their mouth. <br>  I would see if you could take the baby into a clinic or at least STRONGLY encourage her mother too if you (legally) aren't allowed to.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	thrush causes white milk or cottage cheese looking spots in the mouth. if they've been picked at they can look like raw spots. they won't look like blisters though. good luck.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It causes sores in the mouth and on the hands, feet, and sometimes the buttocks and legs. Mouth sores can be painful and may make it hard for your child to eat. The disease is not serious, and it usually goes away in a week or so.<br>  It can occur at any time of year, but hand-foot-and-mouth disease is most common in the summer and fall. its usually accompanied by a fever aswell.<br>  OR<br>  there is Thrush: A common sign of thrush is the presence of creamy white, slightly raised lesions in your mouth—usually on your tongue or inner cheeks—but also sometimes on the roof of your mouth, gums, tonsils, or back of your throat. The lesions, which may have a "cottage cheese" appearance, can be painful and may bleed slightly when you scrape them or brush your teeth. In severe cases, the lesions may spread into your esophagus, or swallowing tube.<br>  <br>  Before anyone calls CPS, talk with the mother, maybe she hasnt notice, maybe they just arrived... etc... if mom does take baby to the doctor, then maybe your friend can offer too.|`|yzzogHLQaa	No telling what it could be but don't call CPS for this. Once they are involved it's really hard to get them out of the picture. If you notice real physical abuse then call them. Tell the babysitter to talk to her mother about the blisters that she should take the baby to the doctor.|`|sRjURY43aa	it could be the bottles are too hot. Or maybe she is allergic to something
ca03c4dbfbf739cc439141f60d700173aa	I would say the chances are medium. If you have sex the day after you finish your period, you are already on day 6 or so of your cycle. The sperm can then live in the body for up to 5 days. Not all women ovulate on day 14 - that's just an average. It depends on the person and on the length of your cycle. So if you have a short cycle or ovulate earlier in your cycle, there is a chance of getting pregnant just after your period ends.|`|4a2bdb68b50289a4f6f53255d0a0af9eaa	Hard to get pregnant after your period. lol|`|cfc9f4eaea01c5c910e361f6ce7eae98aa	very vague chances b'coz ovulation takes place during 14 th day of the menstrual cycle ,i.e in the middle and if during that period  coapulation takes place then only fertilisation can take place and you can be pregnant. got it
90fa3da66aec4db5007b5f2ccb28f367aa	I"m sorry!  I wasn't on bed rest, but had some friends who were.  I'd go visit them lot's to help keep them company.  They'd get on their lap top and get on the internet, watch favorite tv shows on DVD, or movies, read books/magazines.  watch tv, listen to the raido or cd's.  I know it's not much, and it's hard on you.  Just know 3 months isn't that long- my one friend was on bed rest at 2 months pregnant.  So it could definitely be longer.  Also- it's for the best- to keep you and your baby healthy and safe.  Knowing you are doing what you can to protect this sweet baby will make you proud :)  <br>  <br>  Goodluck, and I wish you the best!<br>  <br>  also- something that helped me pass time at nights when I couldn't sleep during my pregnancy- Spider Solitaire!  lol  It was very addicting and fun too!|`|8fe060f66536441f8494e7f73335553baa	I was put on bedrest at 6 months along also.  I found out then how much I enjoyed reading.  Puzzles are also a good way to pass the time.  Make it a slumber party! Have your friends and family join you with there PJ's from time to time.|`|07a5cc35d6539d01d7e827eaf43cd26baa	I was put on bed rest with my oldest at 6mo. pregnant.  I watched TV, read, puzzles, played games on my laptop, filled out a pregnancy journal and cross-stitched.  I also ordered a yard swing that was big enough to lay on to enjoy the fresh air. (But, that depends where you are at!! I was in Texas at that time.) It's really not that bad.. It just irritated me that I couldn't work and stuff like that. So, hope it all works out for you.<br>  <br>  Just pick up a hobby that requires you to lay around or sit down.<br>  Crocheting blankets for the baby (this is a breeze & fast to pick up on.), Cross stitching, Scrap books for the new baby ( Just get them ready), Knitting baby booties (Super easy), Make a pregnancy journal, Fleece Knot Blankets.  Anything will work like this.<br>  <br>  Good luck dear and CONGRATS!!!<br>  <br>  Sincerely, Kendra
NkjAqQWBaa	This could be your "bloody show" and in that case get ready, because labor usually begins shortly after. Everyone is different though. OR you could have an infection...do you have a lot of  discharge with the blood?? Or the blood could just be from an exam, that will sometimes cause you to bleed. Also when your cervix is dialating and you are thinning out you will sometimes bleed. Either way would say its just another sighn your getting closer. Google "bloody show," and see what you find about it. Good Luck! :)|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Yes, that is still your plug coming out.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Just keep an eye on it...as long as you are not having contractions or your water hasn't broken you should be fine. If the bleeding starts again I would definitely call the doctor back just to make sure.|`|UkQuMykiaa	I would think so.  With my first pregnancy that is what it looked like but it came out in one glob.  The last pregnancy it looked like "snot" as you described and came out over two days.  This is what is sounds like.  I have never had the bleeding before, but if the hospital said it sounded normal...If ever in doubt call your dr. - that is what they are there for.  Good luck to you :o)|`|3TogjTchaa	this is what happened to me but my mucus plug came away in one go on a tues night at 10am then on the wed morning at 3.30 i was in labour. so my advise to you is get your hospial bag ready the baby is coming very soon congratulations and good luck you will love being a mom|`|yKS2UI87aa	Yep, sounds like the rest of it. (I lost mine in 2 installments) but still took a week before labor started. Good Luck
AA11985760	I got pregnant right after my miscarriage last year. My doctor said that it's best to wait 3 months, but that if I conceived before that, "oh well!"<br>  <br>  "Oh well" happened, and now I have a beautiful baby daughter. I will warn you, however, that your next pregnancy, no matter when you conceive, will be very tough emotionally. I was a nervous wreck - terrified that I would miscarry again, or that I conceived too soon and somehow didn't give my baby the proper uterine environment.|`|c5ae01b7df6d7be31d894be2c8e79863aa	wear 2 condoms or get pregnant|`|1538acea2c2eca00dd3e3d9618421e28aa	As long as you are not bleeding still and you feel up to it I would say it is safe to have protected sex, but you should definetly not have unprotected sex for 3 months and give your body time to heal.|`|6a203e9e5457ea5643f5065bd301d6c3aa	You should probably contact your doctor. I am guessing most people on yahoo-answers at 12:30pm EST are not doctors. <br>  <br>  Please do not take the advice of people that lack knowledge on this important topic.....<br>  <br>  And how can I get a thumb down for this? Sorry if I hurt the feelings of people who aren't doctors...|`|c96ca96f7eee4cfb72ee300491cb5c62aa	I would wait a few months to try and get pregnant again. The reason women have miscarriages means its not meant to be at that time. You cervix might need a few months to get ripe again, in other words, to hold the baby "in" so you dont have another miscarriage. Good luck!
VMASMHX6aa	Not necessarily...OPKs are less sensitive than HPTs. So you probably wouldn't see a positive on an OPK until about 3 days after you saw a positive on a HPT. Pregnancy tests are sensitive to 10miu/ml, ovulation tests only to 30miu/ml.<br>  <br>  However, if you are using those internet cheapie tests then try not to get too excitied until the line is stronger. I had an amazing evap line on one this month...got really excited but it was just an evap!<br>  <br>  Fingers crossed for you!|`|pR4nLjyRaa	When I found out I was pg I tested on several OPKs and they were +.<br>  Does the line have color? If so its probably not an evap.<br>  Fingers crossed its a real BFP!<br>  We all know you deserve it!<br>  :) Good luck!|`|XTf9VaLoaa	im so sorry for ur loss! ilost mine 5weeks ago at 27 weeks, it hurts lot! that happend to me to wen i was preg. its very rare to have a false pos. good luck! n loads of baby dust x|`|oN9UNGZfaa	I'm 9 weeks pregnant and my opk's are still neg|`|sk46uigvaa	Hi Harry's mum, <br>  <br>  sorry to put a downer on things but i read that you used an internet cheapy 10miu hpt and i wanted to let you know that i had 2 very faint positives on the same ones the other week but my AF came the next day.<br>  <br>  I posted a similar question and there are other women using them tests getting the same results!?!?!<br>  <br>  I REALLY hope it's for real in your case though!!.<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|XO4talxxaa	I really hope you are preggo!! I am crossing my fingers and praying for you :) Just wait like 2 more days and test again :)|`|CIZjK2rAaa	Wow this happened to me as well and I asked the exact question a few months ago.  I am now 17 weeks 2 days pregnant.<br>  <br>  I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks and then found out I was pregnant 4 weeks later.  I too had a faint line so I went to the doctor for a blood test.  Sure enough I was pregnant!  No period in between.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope you are pregnant and am so sorry for your loss.  I could not imagine losing a baby so far into the pregnancy.|`|PwhrTNZraa	After I knew for sure I was pregnant, I decided to test every few days with opk's "just for fun" because I still had like 25 of the cheapie ones left.  Every time I tested the line came up faster and darker, I was about 6-8weeks along.  Eventually the test line came up even before the control line did lol.  I'm thinking you should wait a few days and try using another HPT.  Fingers crossed for you hun!!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. I was bored b/c as you know I am supposed to be "resting" lol and I decided I would do a test of my own. My HCG was at 10,000 and i did an OPK and it was BFN!! like no line at all! So I would just take another test hun!!!! OMG I AM CROSSING MY FINGERS AND PRAYING FOR YOU HUN!!!!!!!!! TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!|`|LlVJiVoIaa	i tested with OPK wen i found out i was pregnant on monday and it came up positive-i was asking a question to why this was!<br>  <br>  hope i helped a tad!!!
AA11985760	Basically, it's a small "wand" that the sonographer inserts into your vagina. (They put a condom and lubricant on it first.) Usually, the sonographer will let you "get it started" so that he or she doesn't hurt you with the initial insertion. <br>  <br>  I had one after my miscarriage last year, and it was uncomfortable, but not painful. I had another one 2 months later when I was 9 weeks pregnant and it wasn't uncomfortable - just a little embarrassing. In fact, the regular abdominal ultrasound I had a few weeks later was more uncomfortable than the transvaginal one, because my bladder had to be full, and they kept pushing hard on my abdomen.<br>  <br>  Also, the transvaginal ultrasound got a better picture of the baby, because it was closer to the fetus.|`|16b912e4bd4d6f66ed2959a22f1ac3caaa	Don't be concerned about a trans-vaginal ultrasound. It is A very common procedure. They insert this very small light inside of you, and you see everything going on inside of you on the computer screen. It doesn't hurt and it's over with fairly quickly. But be aware that they are not always accurate. I had one done seven years ago and was told that I had an enlarged uterus. Turned out I really had a ruptured cyst and endometriosis. I had to have an emergency hysterectomy(partial), then six months later a complete one. Ask questions!|`|AA11226053	I instremint is inserted into your vagina, they use lubricant & a sleve (like a condom) The instrimint is kind of like a big penis for lack of better discription.  It hurts a bit, they move it around alot.  I have it done after a miscarriage & to look for palops.  Here is a link
4db6ede515eb5c477b209de75533ce45aa	My daughter just had a baby 10 weeks ago, she  was feeking the same way . You just have the baby sickness , it can last a long time ( sorry) My daughter was sick the whole 9 months . Make sure to go see your doctor , you will end up in the hospital if you cannot keep anything down , good luck friend !!|`|AA10135406	if you are throwing up they may give you a suppository to stop the nausea , thowing up can cause contractions. please stay hydrated if possible.|`|948ef77f3c7678cb302784b746c11e1daa	Well, you probably have the flu and it's not related to the pregnancy.  The Brax. Hicks are probably happening because of irritation by  you throwing up a lot.  Try little sips of water occasionally (or even just swish around in  your mouth and spit out) until this passes.|`|3cb6be01d6429fa636383535287388d2aa	Go to the doctor you might be in labor because of the fact that you could have caught the flu. It can cause you to dialate and give birth early. Better safe then sorry if it is nothing then they will send you home and make you stay on bed rest just to be safe. The throwing up isn't good becuase then the baby isn't getting what they need and their nuetriants and growth is halted.|`|AA11985760	I was between 25-29 weeks when I got the flu. I called the doctor and said I thought it was the plague. The nurse said that any Tylenol products were ok to take, even the Tylenol Flu stuff. Unfortunately, that's all you can do. If you run a high fever (I think over 103), then you'll need medical care.<br>  <br>  Feel better!|`|e9d8975329841b1d5422afa4f70afe94aa	I'm 17 weeks pregnant and just got over the flu.  I was throwing up every 15 minutes for over 4 hours! My midwife told me to go the  ER. They said I was severly dehydrated, gave me 2 bags of Saline water, and gave me Phenergan to knock me out so I'd stop throwing up. It just made me sleep through it. That's the only way I got over it though.|`|4e4d8a6e25a19607eb4693a171996232aa	Well sometime during those weeks I had a fever, vomiting and diarrhea...but it was a stomach virus. It could be a number of things.|`|f5f10c4e23e1adb1f21655edb30bb820aa	Well -- when I went into labor at 34 weeks, I had some cramping and then a headache for several days.  I'd suggest going to the hospital if you can to see if you're in active labor.  I was sorry I didn't find out sooner because maybe labor could have been stopped if I'd gone in earlier.     Hope all is well and try to keep that kid in there for at least a couple more weeks.  <br>  <br>  Christie
40ca7b1ba1f6834701fddeaa2946f4f1aa	If your better half isn't interested in visiting than don't bother the bitter old granny BUT if your better half still wants to try and have some semblance of a relationship with the woman try and keep it to a bear minimum. My mother was the same way but as long as we kept the conversation to at most a half an hour we left on amicable terms.

But, as the parents, you have to decide who should and shouldn't be around your children. I think as long as you keep their best interest in mind, whatever decision you make will be the right one.|`|AA11453483	First off, you need to limit your kids' visitation with their g-ma.  Its not healthy for them to be around her.  I know words are just words however, she's not a good role model.  You have to ask yourself if you want your kids to grow up acting like she does.  If there is no way around distancing your family from her, you need to tell your children that the way g-ma behaves is unacceptable and if they act that way it will not be tolerated.  Then you or your fiancee needs to address this with g-ma herself and express your concerns.  As for the bills, I realize you are struggling but you can't really get upset if she doesn't send money.  Maybe her financial situation is not what it seems.  I would be grateful that she even agreed to $25.  And who knows if it was really sent.  On the flip side, if she only sent $25, is it really worth getting her all worked up by asking for $$?  I don't think $25 is worth it personally.|`|a75f0cfefcde42f7dd3feb8dbc7c07a8aa	First off, the pot cannot call the kettle black ok? u seem to be a swearer 2. about the whole thing were she threatens them, ignore her, dont let the kids go see her tell them that there grammy is sick and they cant see her, dont contact her. when and if she sends something to u sent it back, dont even open it.

hKJIDdVqaa	No, in most case I do not agree with crying it out. Sometimes babies are just aggravated and letting them cry is the only answer. But the majority of the time the child needs something and should be attended to.  These baby moments only come around once, we should take advantage.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Id say between 4-6 months, you could use a phasing out cry it out.  Like start with a couple minutes, and gradually increase it.|`|FLpMShKNaa	Well it depends on the situation. I wouldn't let my son cry except to get to sleep, like another mom on here said, he needs a nonstimulationg environment of a quiet crib to fall asleep. I was totally against CIO when he was 3 months old, but by the time he was almost 8 months old, we were all tired and miserable, most of all my son. I would forget how to get to places and even use the car seat, so it was also a plain old safety issue. So yes, I used the CIO method because it was the only way. Now he is a great sleeper, he is happy and everyone noticed right away how much happier he was once he got the sleep he desperately needed. So, I am sure I'll get thumbs down, but esp. moms of younger babies, don;t be so quick to judge because time/experience, and necessity might change your views.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I personally could not let any of my children under the age of 1 "cry it out". I mean if you've done everything that you can do, and the child is still crying, even if you are comforting them....and say you need to go to the bathroom or clean dishes...well then i could do that, if necessary, but just letting them cry and cry and cry...No, i couldn't do it.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	I say it's wrong. Don't have them if you can't be bothered to raise them. Why is it okay to have your child cry it out when they are older but not when they are younger? It's still the same child. And still just a cruel. Maybe you'll change your mind when your daughter is older. I hope so.|`|P4LBygv2aa	same as you|`|p9GOxzsNaa	Most young babies are comforted by regular closeness to their parents at less than 6 months. If it is naptime or nighttime, and you are in bed, then it's time to use the CIO so you get your rest too and there is a routine and schedule for baby. At 6-7 months when they start to crawl, then it is natural to use the CIO methods to improve self-soothing and develop independence. The CIO method does require first checking that there is not a valid reason for crying, like too cold, too hot, need changing, hunger.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	I think its great, it starts the child on the road to independence, the baby has to learn to soothe themselves.<br>  <br>  We started CIO at 5 months old with my kids, it lasted a week with my son, 3 days with my daughter<br>  <br>  My kids can think for themselves, soothe themselves and are independant.<br>  <br>  I think CIO is perfect if you do it right, they cry, you check them make sure they arent wet or hungry, put them down and let them cry for 15 minutes, check them and repeat and as the time goes on, you futher in between checks<br>  <br>  go ahead and thumbs down me now|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	When my son was born, I wanted so desperately to cuddle and rock him to sleep for bedtime. He had other ideas. The more I rocked and soothed, the more distraught he became. I finally quit, and simply put him to bed. He'd cry for a few minutes and drift off to sleep. It was a lot less stressful for both of us. <br>  <br>  It really depends on the child and what they need. What works for one, doesn't necessarily work for another. There is no proven one method that works for all children.|`|ibj4lPkvaa	I personally couldn't do it. I want him to have a sense of security that his needs will be met. But sometimes I'll wait through a few minutes of fussiness before I go in there.<br>  <br>  In the long run, though, I doubt CIO does any damage. Most of the kids I know who were raised that way turn out to be very well-adjusted. It's just not my cup of tea.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	Its wrong, mean and neglectful to say the least.|`|j2nvPFr7aa	Personally, when a baby cries you should go to them.  Picking them up teaches them that they are loved and will help them become more confident as they grow older, and that when they have emotional needs they are filled.  Imagine being a lonely little baby crying because something is obviously wrong and no one does anything but let you lay there and cry more. My 6 year old never cried and she is strong and confident and a loving little girl, where as my friends daughter was left to cry and to cry herself to sleep and she is insecure, timid and shy.  I have a 2 month old and we never let him cry either.  We Personally don't like the thought of it, when a baby cries there is a reason be it they are tired, something hurts or they just want love.  They are human and when you are sad or lonely or hurt you more than likely want someone there for you...why is a baby any different?  Trust me, you and your baby will both benefit from you being there when she needs you now and in the future.  I don't agree with letting them cry, what is the benefit other than selfish reasons?<br>  Also, my daughter is very independent and can do anything on her own....knowing she always has people there for her helped her with that.  Babies don't need to be independent, they are babies therefor they need us and that is our job as parents to be there for whatever they need.
14RzmDTmaa	its way to early to get pregnancy symptoms. sorry, it might be ovulation. another thing is if you put it in your mind that you may be pregnant then your body will react. so do think about it to much, your mind will trick you. but good luck.|`|Rxi8wu5Paa	wayyyy to soon to tell now hun

diT2WFfCaa	This is a question for your doctor.<br>  <br>  If you haven't had your period in a year, then the chances of you conceiving are fairly low...but there is always still a chance.  Since you have other issues relating to your menstrual cycle, this isn't really a question that can be answered by someone who doesn't know the specifics.  Talk to your doctor- I'm sure they will be more than willing to help you figure out if you are pregnant, or, if not, what else could be going on.<br>  <br>  Also, the symptoms you are describing can be signs of pregnancy OR PMS symptoms.  So check with your doctor.  It's probably the only way to be sure.|`|uuHPneEcaa	well u can go to the doctor and have them do blood work and all that fancy stuff.. or u can take a pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  But if u haven't had a period in over a year then u might need to see if ur able to concieve and all that other stuff u know.. i don't want you to get ur hopes up over nothing. Have u had any test done to see if u can get pregnant?|`|pUltSWNnaa	You haven't had a period for a year? Hmm.  May consider a second opinion from a doctor.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	you still have a chance of getting pregnant, smaller chance than other women but still a chance. you still need to use protection! if you didn't use protection the other day, test now anyways!|`|HrDcaocMaa	You really need to talk to the doctor on that one...  If you aren't menstrating at all - having a baby could be quite fatal for you - You should seriously see your doc on this...|`|PN7XMglOaa	Kerri , you're pregnant .|`|whHVJc0gaa	ok maybe your not pregnant but you might have an S.T.D but dont worry you vcan cure it with antibiotics thats what i did|`|BM5ygFzVaa	You need to see your ob/gyn and see about getting referred to an endocrinologist. They(ob/gyn) will test for ovulation along with testing you for PCOS. The endocrinologist will test for thyroid issues as well as other hormonal issues. All hope is not lost for being able to get pregnant. I too am overweight. My primary care doctor always made me feel awful about my weight, but never tested for reasons why I was never losing weight, but continually gaining, despite being on a strict 1100 calorie/day diet and working out 1hr per day 4 days a week. Turns out I have a pituitary tumor that makes my body believe it is continually pregnant, so any food gets stored rather than being burned off. I was put on medication and 3 months later, the weight started dropping, my hormone levels were nearly normal, and I got pregnant. Good luck to you and God bless.|`|1e3UyfYEaa	SOOOOOO DO IT AGAIN WHILE ON UR PERIOD..STOP FOR A MINUTE AND THEN CHECK WITH A TEST

157e4d437412bf00f31e286dbde8fad6aa	I have had a simillar problem my breast have been feeling the same...... this can be due to alot of things could just be hormones.  It is possible that you are pregnant.  I am not sure if you missed your period yet but if you did I would probably take a test.|`|06240a02a5df6bd5c529cd2dfef4c18baa	Could be either pregnancy or that you are getting your period. The symptoms for both are the same. I get sore breasts before my period, but when i was pregnant they were also sore. But on top of that, they grew 2 cup sizes within a few days. The only sure way to tell is wait to see if your period comes, and if it doesn't then take a home pregnancy test or go to your doc.|`|b9afca39f44580b362f24a3c0fc903f5aa	you could be...try a test|`|00ca87914343574223f3bf166f7b4bcbaa	Yep when I was pregnant they were very tender.

H2ciLJoPaa	I had implantation bleeding... basically I thought I had gotten my period a week early, for maybe an hour or so I had some bright red blood, a fair amount too, but then it vanished and I still had normal period like cramps so I thought it would come back, but it definetly did not so about a week and a half later I got a test and it was positive! I really had no other symptoms until the morning sickness started (the next day after i found out I was pregnant - partially due to a bit of anxiety I think, otherwise quite a coincedance!)|`|hhCOeMoVaa	hi i had the implant in twice in total for six years.the first time the implant was put into my arm for the hole first month my period was here there and eveywhere....it was very furstrating and i went back to my doc and she put me on the pill for a month and that regulated my period.the second time i had the implant put in however i did not have much bleeding at all maybe one every 2 or 3 months....i hope this is some help....but i would go bac toyour doc and make sure just to put your mind a ease.....can you look at my question and se if you can help me pleas if you have time.....
GWveqx61aa	you might have been pregnant, have you ever heard of a chemical pregnancy, its where the egg fertilizes but never implants it you just pass it in a period, without a clue in the world.sometimes pregnancy symptoms and period symptoms are alike, only one way to tell for sure, take a test, the dollar store sells them and they are actually good, good luck and baby dust to all of us

S93sH3fFaa	Yes, it is normal. <br>  You will be watching this kind of patterns until the baby reaches out the third month or so. <br>  After that they start getting more sleep and you will be helping it to get accustom to an on time eating schedule 6 times for every 24 hrs. Later on to 5 times/24...and so on.<br>  The reason is because the baby is now realizing that it is not anymore in you and can't eat all the time it wants. <br>  <br>  Right now my cousin has a six days old baby...so imagine waking up every 2 and half hours...<br>  Women are very strong to stand any situation and capable to do everything they want to do.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!  : )  : )  : )  Say hello to your baby...<br>  Good|`|WPI0Z47saa	That is pretty much all babies do at that age. It sounds normal to me.|`|xwZV9jgPaa	at 5 weeks old there is no "normal" sleeping pattern. Some babies at 5 weeks sleep thru the night and some wake up every hour. Then you got the fun ones....a bunch of moms will agree....that never sleep. As long as your baby is gaining weight properly and all and all healthy I wouldn't worry about how much she sleeps.|`|9MxlhuXzaa	YES! My boy ate at 10 and would sleep all night long. My daughter, ate ALL the time, all night long (much like yours) dont worry about it.|`|hXSCf9zlaa	my kiddo had a similar pattern.....they are all so different from each other. my son would wake up every 4 ours or so. then when he turned 1, it eventually went to 1 time a night.|`|txv7TIgiaa	all babys are different my daughter still wakes up at least once in the night and she is 14 months...
78a7c5f33e0c4c9332af2ebd35a36084aa	Could be.  If your period is late, take a home pregnancy test.  Those are usually fairly accurate.  If it's negative and you still feel you might be, see your doctor.  Blood test results can be more accurate.|`|AA10117437	That's exactly how I feel!  I'm about 7 1/2 weeks.|`|843ade04da74a1fa663d8282e3c51105aa	Only way to know for sure is to do a Pregnancy test.  I like EPT.  Then, you can go double check with a blood test.  Takes about 10 minutes and they should be able to tell you right there if they have the right equipment to spin the blood.|`|3cd678aa64eb70ae9ed0392e567d56bcaa	when your breast hurt is usually a very good sign, that you are. i have 2 yr old and a 5 month old. that's the way it started for me.|`|b64afa34a8001d446b35c83a4a2b2dbfaa	It certinaly sounds like it -- better see someone now.
AA12057101	Wait a few days and try it again. I tested myself like 4 times before I saw the other line clearly. Its sometimes hard to tell with those things. By the pack were you get two for the price of one that way you will have two tests and you can keep testing at different times. Again, give it another day or two and try again. Good luck to you!!!|`|1e6e8e02d758658f9ad0e76f54ca65feaa	It could still be a little early to tell with that test. You could always take another one. I know that after a while you should disregard the test because after so much time they start to show the second line. My guess would be that you're not, I don't know of too many people who had they're tubes tied and not have it work for them. <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you.|`|991623483fab2646191b06c4cc5abde8aa	It doesn't happen very often, but the truth is having your tubes tied isn't a 100% guarantee of never getting pregnant, so the best thing for you to do is see your doctor right away.  He/she will be able to determine whether or not you're pregnant much better than an over-the-counter pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|AA11710504	You could just be seeing the evaporation of the test line.  I was using the digital tests, and even when they came out negative, when I ejected the test strip, there would be a VERY faint line present for the test line.  They were all accurate though.  <br>  Give it a couple days and if your period still doesn't show up, test again.  Use an early detection test, they measure hCG down to a lower concentration.|`|0b59ce1ebc9cf343545a6107a96f1e39aa	with my last baby I took 4 home tests because they were a shadow of a line and i couldnt figure out if it was positive or negative. after i let them sit about a day i looked at it again and the line was much clearer.|`|f94cd50b8f5f1c2dc5dcffa087b8f9d1aa	sometimes pregnancy kits are not that accurate <just for some cases>, i advice you to go to your ob-gyne.|`|06f9d740cdcc48a0fb7552f12d50cba0aa	I know it will be hard but wait a few days and test again. Your eyes could be playing tricks on you. <br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|AA11985760	What you're seeing could be an evaporation line. It depends on if you waited longer than the recommended time (usually 10 minutes) to view the results.<br>  <br>  Or you could be pregnant - I've known a few people who had their tubes tied and still got pregnant. <br>  <br>  Take another test to be sure. Use a digital test that interprets the lines for you. Good luck!
AA11025973	It always vary from women to women but MOST are within 2 weeks after ovulation (which of course you past) But I know people who haven't gotten a BFP til 10 weeks into their pregnancy and she was having twins. So I would test once or twice a week for the next week or so and see if your period shows up; but if you are like me and can't wait; schedule an appointment with your dr :] Good luck!|`|bVkIEpyGaa	HCG only starts being produced once an egg has implanted. Implantation itself can take between 5 and 16 days from fertilisation. The levels then should double ever 2-3 days. I used a pregnancy test that detected 10mlU and it didn't show up positive until I was 5 days late. Its impossible to say when you should reach 25mlU as it depends when implantation took place.|`|ApyrV5J9aa	Like others have stated, it kind of works differently for everyone. I was at 26 two days before my period was supposed to start. I got a VERY faint line on a First Respons early response test that day and my bloodwork confirmed that it was at 26. At the same time, I have talked to women who were three months pregnant and still unable to get a positive pregnancy test. Although that is unlikely, there is still a chance that you could be like that. My suggestion is to go in for a blood test if at all possible. If will tell you the exact number and they are much more reliable than urine tests. Good luck to you!

While Echo Emotion Love sounds like an awesome Myspace name, as a real, functioning name, it doesn’t quite cut it. <br>  <br>  Eden, Iris, Hazel, Leora, Iris, Lucasta, Mattea, Linnéa (lin eh uh), Romilly, Elowen (my new personal favorite), and Sylvia may be some names you would like. Also check out Greek names, they have a certain feel for them that I feel you enjoy.<br>  <br>  Acacia (uh cay shuh) , Amethyst, Apphia (uh fee uh), Carina, Catarina, Cora, Elysia (eh LIS ee ah), and Leocadia are all Greek names.<br>  <br>  Violet Leora Love<br>  Celeste Iris Love<br>  Lilac Mattea Love<br>  Victoria Hazel Love<br>  Scarlett Apphia Love<br>  <br>  Elijah, Forrest, and Asher are lovely from your boy’s list. Elijah Blue has great potential. I have Gavin Bleu on my personal list. <br>  <br>  Again with the cheesy dark names here. “Hollow”, “Night”, and “Dusk” just look silly put with names like Elijah and Asher. Remember, you aren’t naming an animal, this a human being.

Given a little work, your list could be a very nice one that reflects your personality, but also has a little wiggle room for the child’s.|`|zgXpomfCaa	Most of the first names are nice, it's just the middle names that are truly awful. Gravity and Fantasy are the worst of them, to me.<br>  <br>  Have you considered names that mean the things? For example, Bella or Belle instead of Beauty. Instead of Star, how about Venus, Astra, Estella or Estée?<br>  <br>  If I could mix and match your names, I'd suggest:<br>  Scarlett Celeste. Scarlett Victoria. Victoria Celeste.<br>  Elijah Blaze.

Understanding pregnancy symptoms is important because each symptom may be related to something other than pregnancy. Some women experience pregnancy symptoms within a week of conception. For other women, symptoms may develop over a few weeks or may not be present at all. Below is a listing of some of the most common pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  Implantation Bleeding:<br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.<br>  <br>  Delay/Difference in Menstruation:<br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period. This symptom is commonly explained by other reasons. If you have been sexually active and have missed a period, it is recommended that you take a test: Order my pregnancy test<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.<br>  <br>  Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.<br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.<br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.<br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.<br>  <br>  Your Next Steps:<br>  Experiencing these symptoms?

Dont listen 2 your frinds they are just haters because they know you look good for u being 6 months.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Your absolutely gourgous I looked like tht my first pregnancy at 25 weeks ur not big at all you look beautiful. Don't listen to them. I hear the same thing now I'm 11 weeks with baby 2 and I look as though I'm five months but I jus brush it off.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	you are bigger than most girls are at that point, but you'll probably just have a big baby. do big babies run in your family? really...it's nobody's business how big you are. and everyone carries their babes different. good luck and try not to stress out about it. people just like to be nosy.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You look soooo pretty. I wish I looked that good. I feel like a monster! I'm 28 weeks and not showing as much as you are, because of the baby's position. My baby is super low and spread out. I feel like I just look fat.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	i was like that at 38 weeks, and I put on 42 lbs total - all fluid cos both babies were about 7lb 10oz.<br>  as long as you're healthy and having regular scans and check ups, it's just the way you put on pregnancy weight|`|mTyu7CKoaa	hahaha thats nothing, I was 26 weeks and 3 or 4 day when this picture was taken<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s360.photobucket.com/albums/oo42/brodyodiemommy/?action=view&current=Picture011.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s360.photobucket.com/albums/oo42/...</a><br>  <br>  hope that makes u feel better|`|X3zl9hZCaa	I think you look great!

I mostly just sarcasticlaly replied to those comments with a "Aw thanks how sweet of you to say..."<br>  <br>  But you definetly look good and healthy!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	that's exactly what I felt like at 25 weeks. Everyone was like gosh you must have twins huh?? You are too big to have just one in there at 25 weeks... But I think you look great. And you weight gain is fine. By 25 weeks I had gained I think 31 pounds. So every woman is different, weight gain will be different, and not every woman will look the same being pregnant.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Hi, I'm 26 weeks and this picture was taken last week:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://public.fotki.com/chroe/ultrasound/2212009043.html" rel="nofollow">http://public.fotki.com/chroe/ultrasound...</a><br>  <br>  See, we're almost the same size! And yes, we're big for our weeks, but it doesn't mean anything. You look beautiful. Don't let them bother you! <br>  <br>  I had a lady at my work inform me that I'm having a girl (I am) because the baby is "stealing my beauty". When asked to clarify, she said that my nose is getting bigger. People are so mean! You look great.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	you look fine<br>  it doesnt look like you have gained a lot of weight. most of it is your stomach, which good<br>  don't listen to anyone. all women are different during pregnancy. you may gain all your weight early on and then stop. a lot of ppl do that. i stayed the same sized from 6 months on. (i was huge by 6 months lol)|`|WsUSAgLmaa	omg....you should have smacked her...lol you look perfectly find I am 30 weeks and i wish my stomach was that size..Im rather small.<br>  CHECK IT OUT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=372962405&albumID=529090&imageID=17751723" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a>|`|m8alP5kPaa	I am 32 weeks along and I'm about as big as you are now. <br>  BUT everyone is different and when I was pregnant with my first, I was huge too. <br>  Don't worry about it.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	No, you look awesome!! And I'm surprised you've gained 20 pounds already because I honestly don't see where you're hiding it all!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You are not huge, you have the cutest baby belly.<br>  <br>  Think about this, you're only 11-15 weeks from delivery.|`|KNMzQIhvaa	nah! you look fine as long as you have not gained too much food weight! i bet its lots of water and perfectly sized baby. good luck and just ignore what pepole say .|`|84bfe623838974188db70f3e01e4ea29aa	I think you look absolutely adorable !~!!!|`|cn91FeWcaa	ur bigger than me but i think im a little small ..........tell those jerks ur 6 months and at least ur just carrying it in ur stomach|`|D3KzcRYMaa	I have had 2 pregnancies.  honey you are a MILF!  You are not too big.|`|MtU2yH3gaa	Heck No! I was a little bigger than that when I was 25 weeks, when I went to my 25 weeks appointment, I was measuring up at 28 weeks, and I'm only 5'2! My first daughter was 8 lbs 11 oz, and I'm having another girl, just like you! I say, the bigger the better! And you are all belly, so I wouldn't worry about the weight you have put on! Good Luck!|`|tBLfXv5Gaa	lol i know how you feel i wish i had a penny for every time i was asked if it was only one baby. i am just 3 weeks ahead of you and i'd say we are about the same size except i am carrying up high. you look absolutely normal. and i havent gained but 1lb so far if that helps your feelings any that we are the same size. dont worry about every one else. you look good! congrats!|`|kwQi2OM9aa	You have such a cute belly!  I know how you feel!!  I am 37 weeks 3 days and people keep telling me I'm huge, I'm like duh I'm due soon.  I hate when they ask if it's twins, I have only gained 28 lbs, but you look a lot smaller than me to begin with, your body probably needed the extra weight to carry it.  Just tell them your dr is perfectly happy with your weight gain, and he knows better than them. lol That's how I shut every one up early on!|`|72rH1NvDaa	i'm 24 weeks and i look the same as you do. sometimes people stop me too and joke that i'm having twins. i agree, it's annoying. =( 3 more months of this. but i think everyone is different and grows differently.|`|z26vZUJVaa	No way, you look right on target, and great by the way..You are defintley not too big, and you do not look like there are twins in there..|`|3xrfc95faa	you have a cute belly.<br>  im 17 weeks and i really dont  have one.<br>  <br>  but you look at the right size.|`|KHZLPldraa	Heck no, I am 23 weeks and about the same size.  Maybe they are just jealous and should butt out.    Congratulations! I have gained about 15.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	those comments make me wanna slap them!!<br>  im now 35wks and huge  and still get you sure they haven't missed a twin !!<br>  you look like u have a lovely neat bump and its all baby you not Big any where else so just bite ur tongue and enjoy your pregnancy  x x
06240a02a5df6bd5c529cd2dfef4c18baa	It means that you will ovulate in  the next 2-4 days.<br>  <br>  You should have a sex a few days before, the day of, and the day after ovulating to fall pregnant.<br>  <br>  The egg white mucus helps the sperm's mobility and helps them stay alive until the egg is released 2-4 days later.|`|e6bb68db798bec36ff2835f6d06ca524aa	yup it does. so if you are trying to get pregnant, make sure you do it when you have that.<br>  <br>  good luck
GGH0HVdvaa	I dont think all teens are like that, just the ones that get the most attention for their stupid-ness.<br>  <br>  When I was 12-13 I was more concerned with hanging out with my friends at each other's houses, having sleep overs, getting homework done, and participating in Colorguard with my best friend. Sex was barely a curiosity and I wasn't anywhere near touching drugs, and am still not. Alcohol wasn't even a thought, although now that I am 22 I do drink on occasion without getting crazy.<br>  <br>  I think it may have something to do with how some of these kids are raised. I knew the kind of girls you're talking about, the ones acting like whores and getting into trouble. They were the girls whose parents weren't at home most of the time or who just didn't care about them. They had no good role models to show them how to behave and so they are left to their own devices. It's sad really because those girls will grow up unhappy and with an underdeveloped sense of character and integrity. They most likely wont finish school or go to college and will live out their lives barely making their rent while they struggle to keep a job at McDonalds under the weight of constant drunkeness or the daze that comes from the drugs they always take.|`|N24wkFROaa	Because it's hard on us, we are being pressured to grow up fast not to mention all of the media.<br>  <br>  If we try and be a child we get told to grow up, if we try being grown up we get told to be a child.<br>  <br>  This is why a lot of people my age (13) are having sex, drinking, drugs and just being complete wh*res.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Well as I 14 year old myself, I agree with you. I think it's because we are living in a world which is increasingly becoming image conscious, and I am the same, I care a lot about my appearance (except I don't wear the makeup). A lot of these girls are actually very self-conscious and don't like to be seen without their makeup on. For people like me though, being a teenager is quite frustrating because I believe I am mature enough to do what I like, and make my own way in life, however, we still have to do the day-to-day schooling, studying subjects such as drama, which I have no interest in at all. Thank goodness I have filled in my options form :D<br>  <br>  Oh and also, I have never had underage sex, I don't do drugs either, and I took one sip of a Bacardi Breezer at Christmas and though it was disgusting. I also do not hang out in bus shelters and in the streets until 1am in the morning, shouting my head off... just to show that the stereotype isn't true at all.|`|z0XRuVwSaa	because some kids are forced to grow up fast by our parents . i had to and its no fun either because i wanted to play out with my friends and kick a ball about play hide and seek atc all those kiddie games nah i had to stay in and grow up faster than fast .. maybe the parents are just ain't there 4 them either ?|`|QGP930C6aa	times change...... i dunno its like the new thing at the moment and some teens wnt to grow up waaaaaaay too quickly. But, yer you are so right------- i'm a teenager so i know that when one person does somthing cool many people want to do it as well (not all teenagers but some)|`|BEqAhXBlaa	The tabloid media are a massive culprit|`|6uRWoIjJaa	Because of the breakdown in british moral society! I was 13 (6 years ago) and it was different even then. I believe it is due to the media and more tv usuage. Children are subjected to images of 'teenagers' and start to imitate them, such as fashion, how they act, the 'teenage parent' culture. If the news didn't report it, they wouldn't hear about it. How many parents allow thier children 13+ watch soap operas and similar who show the decaying morals of our society! <br>  (This is just my personal view).|`|L2ldkkoKaa	It's not like that children aren't allowed to be children.<br>  The children aren't allowing themselves to be children. <br>  Most kids these days like to grow up faster and act grown up. But, in reality they're making themselves look bad and inappropriate.|`|IDTQwgBaaa	Did you reprt those girls for underage drinking? I think they do whatever they want cause adults don't do anything about it.|`|q4tTabfjaa	A lot of it is TV and advertising.<br>  Most of the female models in the media are like teenage boys physically.|`|FNOLdEh0aa	I totally agree with you, Im 16 myself and have always been mature for my age. Needless to say I was drinking on streets and at the park when I was 14, Smoking at about 13, Getting into trouble at school when I was 13. And to look back now yeah it was fun but now I've done it all I do regret it. I see all the young ones aged 13 14 etc and think what are you doing, you have years ahead of you too do all this stuff, be a child and enjoy being a child and being imature because you dont have the chance to when your older :( . I dont personally think it is to do with the parents obviously it does contribute to it but its mainly what is going on around them and the peer preasure to do what friends are doing! Soo to all you young ones out there, enjoy your childhood and stop growing up to fast! You dont want to do everything while your young!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I know what you mean. The amount of early teens/pre teens wearing revealing clothes, make up and smoking during half term was repulsive!<br>  <br>  I think it is mainly down to poor parenting. My mum always used to spend a lot of time playing with make up with me and my sister, yet we never slapped it on like some girls do today! We also had the full implications of drugs, under age sex, drink etc explained to us so we were fully aware.<br>  <br>  I don't think parents do enough to encourage their children to engage in simple activities like drama, sports, dance classes...all of these things allow for children to engage in something worthwhile and stop them from seeking cheap thrills. I don't think children should be as mature as they are, they will just look back and regret it.Parents love to blame society and school but the problems always lie at home.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bridget I have not 'got it all wrong' as you stated, that is my opinion and you have yours but you cannot articulate it very well. I am a parent myself, I was brought up in a great house hold and it is very sad that you choose to do something illegal as opposed to behaving like someone of your age should. It usually is a problem at home, lack of communication and lack of attention. You can't just tell someone that their thoughts are 'stupid' based on your individual case, the homestead IS primarily to blame but I didn't say that the media, peer pressure etc wasn't. Interpret an answer properly before responding.|`|claUGpVRaa	I agree with you whole heartedly. I think it is a dreadful shame kids want to grow up so quickly now - there is no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies as they all think is is cool and expected that they should be having sex and drinking and smoking whereas they actually look pathetic!<br>  I think the government is failing in educating kids of this age and about sex and responsibility, but also the parents are to blame as they allow their kids to dress this way, have sex with their consent and hang out on street corners swearing, and drinking alcohol. Seems like the population of this country (and others) is going to the dogs.<br>  The kids are just being led by each other, thinking that by 13 ish they should be behaving in this way!|`|hRV18njLaa	Im a 15 year old girl <br>  <br>  its because everyones pressured into growing up so fast.<br>  <br>  If even one girl at your school wears makeup/fashion-forward clothes, you have to aswell or you are seen as not as mature and people look down on you.<br>  <br>  also, the media is a big influence. You try being my age and not seeing a poster or a magazine with a gorgeous model on the front. It makes you feel worthless and immature, and so you wear makeup and nicer clothes to try be a little closer to those models.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you understand. :)
NbJbZXtGaa	I have a 3.5 yo (will be four in July) and he can play computer games on the internet, converse with Grandma on the phone, and definitely will put a bowl in the sink when asked (even my 18 month old can do that). So, it does sound to me like there might be a delay there, but I don't know if it is your place to bring it up. Maybe you could work with the girl when you are with her.|`|WPI0Z47saa	My son is 3 and I think he understands alot. I also never "baby talked" with him and just talked to him like I would with anyone else. He isn't however potty trained. He is interested in the potty but isn't finished yet. I understand about 95% of what he says. He can identify everything in our home and his surroundings that he has seen before. He can follow mutli tasked instructions like go into the kitchen, put your plate in the sink and the banana peel in the trash can. He can set his toddler games up by himself and put his race track and train tracks together. He can brush is own teeth and hair and wash his toothbrush. He can dress himself and put his clothes in the hamper. So he is totally capable at 3 to perform simple tasks. But the key behind it is to work with the child. Maybe her parents don't make her do anything and just do everything for her. Sometimes either the parents don't make the time or they want to keep their kids as babies. She just needs someone to work with her.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i think her mom may just be babying her. do not talk to her like a baby. if she asks for something and you don't understand her, but u finally do... tell her to say it again like the way you say it. its like correcting her. you can talk to the mom about it, as a nanny i would most likely bring it up but also do my best to help in other ways. dont push her in the stroller if the mom isnt there. make her walk with you. i dont think it is up to you to potty train her but maybe ask her mom, how is potty training going? i work for a family right now when i got here their daughter was 3, 4 a few months later and she already has regular conversations, very observes well, catches on quickly, and hasn't had one accident.|`|sv4guUQNaa	Every 3 year old has a different cognitive level however mine can understand  to put a bowl in the sink cause I've taught her that.  I wouldn't expect her to do anything without me showing her 1st.  If you've shown her and she still doesn't know what you're talking about that'd concern me.  <br>  My daughter speaks gibberish a lot, probably because I'm expecting and she's now pretending like she's a baby.<br>  The potty training thing would concern me but once again if she's not being taught it's not her fault.  Her Mom sounds a little loopy but you have the opportunity to do a lot for her and if she's not responding to you properly I'd bring it to the Mom's attention
UNWLaJbKaa	Well I just found out i'm pregnant an hour ago, but the main symptoms that made me think that I am this month was that my breasts were so sore on the sides and under my armpits only, which I never have before my period.  Also I just randomly took a nap during the day which I never do, and I had small little waves of nausea (very small) which def tipped me off that this is not typical before i get my period. <br>  everyone is different. Some feel every sign, and some feel none.  I took a pregnancy test at 9DPO and it was negative.  Then I took one today at 11DPO and it was positive.. so try to make it through the 2 week wait, and let us know how it turned out.|`|XpLufXKFaa	Some women just "know". They say that they "feel" pregnant. But, most women take a home pregnancy test and with a positive result, they then go to their doctor and get a blood test to confirm. There are many signs and symptoms of pregnancy. I will put a link below.|`|iO3BLRTYaa	a positve hpt
145RUNQHaa	If she's never done this before then get her checked out at the doctors for a urinary tract infection as this can cause bed wetting.give her cranberry juice to drink.dilute any juice she has such as orange juice which is acidic and stay away from cola which will stimulate and irritate her bladder.if this is not the issue then don't make a big deal out of it just put down bed mats to protect your mattress there is no point punishing she definately hasn't got any control over it.some children bed wet when they are really tired and they just are in too much of a deep sleep to notice they need the toilet.it's a common problem there's nothing weird about it at all you just have to be patient and not make any fuss about it at all and it will pass.hope this helps.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	wetting the bed happens when a child is stressed or can be a symptom of a bladder issue. if she just started staying over at your house, or there has been a major change in her normal routine, it would be normal for her to go through this. bed wetting is something that has to be outgrown. there is no way for you to "fix" it so it doesn't happen anymore. you can try not giving her anything to drink after dinner, but it probably won't help if it's stress related. get her some overnights that look like panties if you don't want to have to clean up her mess. and try to be understanding. she doesn't like it anymore than you do.|`|AA11109728	I've learned from talking to other moms and caregivers that it's not always a big deal, sometimes it just happens.  My daughter did the same thing, she was all potty trained and then this past summer she started having accidents often at naptime.  I couldn't figure out any reason for it, no major changes or anything, it lasted quite awhile and then she stopped doing it all on her own.  Sometimes it is due to major changes, other times it's just an unexplained 'phase'.  We had to use pull-ups for naptime for awhile until we moved past that phase.|`|UgZq1pXjaa	It's not uncommon at all for a child that young to start wetting the bed.  I have a 4 yr old son that I diaper at night for bed wetting.  I also was a bed wetter for a very long time and I started wetting the bed after I was potty trained and was diapered at night for it.  I think it can be psychological since she has to keep going from house to house.  I too would have the attitude that is not a big deal.  I know that's a difficult attitude to have but in my opinion if you do make it a huge deal it can make things worse.  I don't know how you feel about diapers for night time use, I did do some research and from psychologist/doctor to psychologist/doctor it seems like its a 50/50 split to diaper at night.  My take is other than the initial diapering, the child does not know what he/she is wearing because they are asleep and I don't want to do laundry every night and ruin the bedding.  I can tell you as a person that did wet the bed for a very long time and diapered myself at night, its much better waking up in a wet diaper than wet bedding.  Use the attitude that it's not a big deal at your house either, use a diaper for protection and giver her the unconditional love she deserves.
Rx31LHjbaa	Well, you guys handled the situation well.  It's really good that you were using protection to start with.  The chances of getting pregnant from precum are low anyway compared to if you ejaculate inside.  Plan B is also rather effective at preventing pregnancy.  If she started her period on Feb 14th, then on the 23rd she wasn't really at the highest point of fertility either.  Close, but not quite there.  All these things combined make for a pretty low chance of pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  Stuff like this is always scary, but it seems like you both did the best you could considering the situation.  Maybe your girlfriend should think about trying birth control if you guys really don't want a baby at this point.  Condoms with spermicide would probably not be a bad idea either.    <br>  <br>  Just try not to worry yourselves to death until she can take a home pregnancy test.|`|8nVHF4QZaa	Sounds as though there's little to nothing to worry about given how quickly you all took "action." There shouldn't be anything for you two to be concerned with  at this point. No real risk or danger since you didn't ejaculate inside of her. <br>  <br>  Try using a different condom next time, or have her consider getting on birth control as a precaution.|`|LkXz94ADaa	Most likely not. if you would have ejaculated I would say maybe because I got pregnant even after taking a morning after pill the same day, but the difference is you stopped once realizing it broke... You should be fine.|`|wkMYDoDBaa	your totally fine. precum doesnt really do anyhthing the chances for getting preg are  like 20% so no worries, i;ve broken a condom and we got the morning after pill and all was well.|`|2dya7YeKaa	I'm sure you guys will be fine.  You did the right thing.  <br>  <br>  The odds that she could be pregnant with the precautions you guys have taken (and considering you hadn't even ejaculted yet) are low.  Try not to worry too much.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	If you did not ejaculate she is not pregnant at least not by you. It takes sperm to fertilize any eggs.(well unless she pulls off some king of virgin mary type trick)|`|WsUSAgLmaa	She took the pill too soon so.........|`|WnlzScIyaa	There should be nothing to be worried about, just relax ya'll are fine. It is just a scare!|`|3Ks21ASDaa	The morning after pill (Plan B) is 86% effective if you take it within 72 hours of unprotected sex. So taking it 2 hours afterwards is good, it's going to be as effective as it can be. It's highly unlikely your girlfriend is pregnant from pre-***. If she had her period on Feb 14, she would have been ovulating around Feb 25-28. Sperm can live inside a girl for 3-5 days so if you had sex on Feb 23rd then it's possible she could get pregnant. But it's really unlikely, considering there are spermicides already on most condoms.
9e425b0b4a42ca6eeff7d4e40ae1f070aa	You should try again on the test you my want to be pregnant but i don't (I am only 15) we both have a big probelm! Try having sex again if it doesn't work I hope it comes out for the best for you!|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	you should see your doctor.|`|a0fcf296530879361de2a81e6d1afea4aa	Your not pregnent but definatly go to a doctor. Pain is not normal.<br>  Good luck|`|06240a02a5df6bd5c529cd2dfef4c18baa	You are not pregnant. You did not have sex when you ovulated, which would have been 2 weeks before you got your period. And you had a negative preg test. No, you are not pregnant. Sometimes periods are lighter, sometimes heavier - its fine.|`|5f8417e0bdd495e4c800573fa55c7e70aa	stop stressing! that could be the reason for the weird bleeding.|`|6f5db0668d800d98696fc4fe3a9c9656aa	I think you should visit a doctor and get all of this off your chest! And about your period not coming normally might be because when you have sex sometimes your tissues and skin can get scraped or etc. But I don't think you're pregnant :-)|`|ecfc65ba3c6943f561e1514574156b26aa	ive had this happen to me also. im thinking maybe you had a misscarrage??? a preg test does not have to be positve to confirm that this was a misscarraige maybe you were jus too early and your body regected the baby?????  i would defff call a docter! good luck|`|00735d364d8d3d4d4b5eb17c11ce3140aa	I just had the same exact thing happen to me. It just your body doing stupid things. A lot of women go through this, so there is nothing to be worried about.|`|03172d36a9cfb033762c161d5e89c091aa	I would not worry about being pregnant since you had sex one day before and on the day your period was due.  I would worry more about an STD.  You need to go to the OBGYN and get checked.|`|52b1fd4735a5ff0942e2523756542a93aa	It doesn't sound like you're pregnant but you should go see your doctor.  There could be any number of reasons you are bleeding inconstantly and having pains.|`|AA10991274	If you had sex a day or two before your period was due, it is possible but unlikely that you're pregnant. You should have ovulated about 14 days earlier .... *should* have. You tested on the 10th ... test again on the 20th using first morning urine to be doubly sure.
deIzFnV8aa	Before you try CIO, why don't you try having a naptime routine to help her settle. <br>  <br>  You can't just pick times for baby's nap; they will nap when they are tired.  What you _can_ do is watch for tired signs (yawns, ear or eye rubbing, turning away from toys, glazed look) and get the to a nap quickly - they will fall asleep sooo much easier if they aren't overtired.<br>  <br>  Do this for a couple of days and note the times baby goes to sleep. you will probably see a pattern.  If baby is going to bed and waking up at about the same time each day, she will probably want to be awake for predictable amounts of time and therefore nap at the same times. Tada - a schedule. This of course has to be flexible to account for unforseen events, special occassions, and different lenghts of naps. But it is a good start.<br>  <br>  To encourage this schedule, start a nap routine. It can be short, like putting on a sleep sack, going into her room,  singing a certain song, and then turning on white noise and leaving.  We do this and usually it either works first time, or I have to come in 2-3 minutes later and soothe her once, but then she is out.  When nap time is coming or you see any tired signs, start this routine. After a week baby should say to herself "I'm feeling tired now!" and settle much easier.<br>  <br>  Obviously key in a schedule is sleeping for the night and getting up at about ths ame time.  Start (or encourage her parents to start) a bedtime routine - a feeding and about a half hour of soothing activites, such as a bath, a book, or a massage - that leads to a consistent bedtime.  Always do the same things in the same order.  A good baby bedtime is between 7 and 9, usually - later than that and baby is overtired and fussy. A consitent bedtime will lead to her getting up around the same time in the morning, will lead to a predictable nap schedule.  See how it all works together?<br>  <br>  You can keep trying CIO, but if baby isn't tired, or overtired, she isn't going to want to take a nap and it will be a fight each time.  Understand from her point of view there are no such things as clocks and places she needs to be, just her natural urges. So its best to work with those urges, and give her gentle encoragement in the right direction.<br>  <br>  There are lots of great books on sechduling and sleeping, like <br>  The Secrets of the Baby Whisperer<br>  and The No Cry Sleep Solution<br>  If you plan on being a nanny for some time, it is probably worth a trip to the library.|`|723QHuicaa	From the time the baby starts to cry, till you immediately get up out of the chair and go get the baby - so I'd say <30sec.<br>  <br>  If I was paying for a nanny to care for my child (wouldn't happen, but hypothetically), I'd want her to be earning her money and not be lazy enough to make my child scream for attention and to be ignored until the clock says its time for the baby to be comforted.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	then why dont you cuddle her and put her in her crib when shes asleep?|`|LhvKTYftaa	2 things!<br>  CIO is cruel and I would definately not pay someone to torture my child.  Cuddle the baby, you're new and the situation is new.  Baby is probably confused too you know!<br>  <br>  #2 This is the most important!  DID THE PARENTS OK CIO???  THEY are the parents, you cannot just do this on your own.  You need to discuss it with them.<br>  <br>  For God's sake the baby is 7 months old, probably teething, confused by a stranger putting them to bed etc.  Cuddle the baby, and stop this nonsense.  I would fire you in half a second if that was my son!!!!|`|ZusC87WBaa	That's easy enough to answer....you shouldn't.  There is absolutely no benefit to allowing a child to feel alone.|`|FYiKgeN8aa	Not at all, Ferberizing is not a good idea.  Even Dr. Ferber himself recanted on his theory.|`|YsnY9LqIaa	Ditto to the first answerer.|`|OT7t6pyyaa	I do not agree with CIO. I have tried it and tried it and it does not work with my son. I feel that it is not fair to him and he doesnt understand why I am doing this to him. I feel if they need comforted they should be. You should be asking the parents these questions first before doing it at all.

kv8ZFPP1aa	go to the dr.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Her breast would be sore but, if they were leaking they would definitely not be leaking white.  Mine leaked early but never white.  Does she have any other children.  Unless she just recently had a child she should not be leaking anything white.  If she hasn't missed a period I wouldn't worry so much.  Breast hurt for many different reasons.  If she has missed a period make her take a test.  Good Luck!|`|wOSv0Y2gaa	From close family friends I heard that when they got diagnosed with breast cancer they were leaking stuff out of there nipples so she needs to get checked out.Because you don't produce milk until after the baby is born...Its Just full of fat until then!|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	You do leak while your pregnant but it normally starts out clear and it's when your pretty far along. Mine started at about 19 weeks. Does she think she's been pregnant for a while?|`|gRZT4pnUaa	kinda sounds that way huh? Has she taken a pregnancy test? She needs to go to the doctor if she's leaking milk already!|`|HW89eJEZaa	she is either pregnant or she has an infection!|`|28qmqsySaa	yes it sounds that way <br>  your going to be a daddy<br>  take a preg test<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  smile|`|c9NuCZnaaa	she's lying.

Her boobs might hurt but leaking doesn't happen usually until end of 2nd trimester/beginning of the 3rd.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I was leaking milk at 5 weeks with my first pregnancy and I didn't have an infection, so it IS possible.<br>  <br>  Have her take a test.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	If she just got pregnant she wouldn't be leaking anything out of her nipples at thsi point... not for a REALL long time. <br>  <br>  So she's either lying, or something else is wrong.|`|OSXAPmrcaa	she is pregnant or this could be a sign of breast cancer .

And use a condom or some other form of protection to prevent a pregnancy, not to mention STD's.|`|2LO5UXUTaa	After you get pregnant you would have to be at least 18 weeks to leak anything so maybe something else is wrong with her. Or she is mental. She needs to go to a doctor if anything is coming out of them because by the way you say it she would only be a couple weeks pregnant
GWveqx61aa	i heard to bring up sperm count use selenium, and zinc, never heard of speman, but about a clinic, i dont have ins, so i called the local pregnancy resource center and they gave us a number for a place that helps at affordable prices, you should try that, good luck and baby dust to all of us
prqrQcd1aa	I think you are thinking of ADHD here.. I have a child that is bi polar and adhd, we don't do anything at all for the adhd.

Medication is always a last resort in my case.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	give them Omega 3 or 6. It works 75% better than drugs.  ADHD is as strong as cocaine.

My 10 yr old has it and isn't medicated. A pill is not a quick fix. Consistency, scheduling and diet work in most cases.

FewhKlx9aa	It sounds to me that maybe the mom may be blaming the baby for all the problems.The fact that maybe she was unexpected and then losing the house.The fact that she is'nt spending any maternal time with her daughter is going to have lasting effects on her as she grows.Maybe if you spoke to the brother in law and see if your sister spoke to him about it.The fact that she is so distant means she does need help with parenting classes.The little girl will always know she was an unwanted child if it is'nt fixed now.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	some mothers are just not maternal.<br>  <br>  plus, she may be going through a depression, with living in your house etc. at least the dad and you bond with the niece  and she seems to have a social life, and isn't being physically hurt.<br>  <br>  be her favourite auntie and give the cuddles her mother doesn't give|`|LwbwMFX9aa	wow I cant imagine not having time with my sweet girl<br>  <br>  let me ask you a hard question. How was your mother with her ? how was that bond ?<br>  <br>  maybe sit down and talk with her and find out what's going on|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Wow, thats sad.  It sounds to me like they had a child because it is the thing to do and not because they actually wanted to be parents and love children.  You know, maybe you should ask your sister to sit down and just tell her what you have observed regarding her and her childs relationship and tell her how you feel.  She'll probably get angry, but if you give her time to think about it, one day it may hit her and she''ll work on changing the situation.  Good Luck.  Also, it sounds like she and her husband are taking advantage of you ...I would have them move out now...they are adults with an education and a child, they should be taking 100% responsability for their little family in thier own home....they do not need to be financially stable (whatever that means exactly)  they can struggle a little, it won't kill them.|`|ibj4lPkvaa	I don't think you should say anything. First of all, you aren't in her shoes to know what's going on exactly. Working while you have a baby is really hard and she probably does what she can. She may just be overwhelmed at times. And going to brunch is not going to do any harm. The baby probably gets lots of playtime with the sitter.<br>  <br>  But even if it is as you think and she isn't bonding with her......she might bond with her later. Sometimes there is a delay in mother/child bonding. And sometimes it never happens. It's sad but I know quite a few women who just don't seem to ever feel that motherly connection to their children. I don't think you can do anything about it. Just be the best aunt you can for her.|`|x0pmygthaa	you know, sometimes you have to bring these matters to their attention,cause in some way they may not know that what they do to the child.I still have some fear in bringing touchy issues with my kids but if i don't tell them who will? I usually start out by saying '' look,I'm gona tell you what's on my mind. I don't want to tell you how to raise your kids, when I see that you are being unfair with the child,or your not right on somethings i need to let you know. I don't want you to get mad because it's nothing to get mad about, I'm just trying to give you some advice and you take fine,if not, that's fine too, just know that i love you and i just want to be there for you and help if i can. I'm glad that the baby has someone who knows that babies at her age need lots of love and attention, and you are giving it to her even thow you feel it is not your place to do so, but in the long run she will have a close relationship with her aunt and she will thank you for being there the most.
bBP1Xlnkaa	At 13 months there is very little you can do except remain calm and consistent in removing him from the situation. Sorry to say, but their tiny brain at that age is just not ready yet, but now is the time to "teach" him what no is. My suggestion is as soon as he is into something he is not supposed to be in, tell him "no" and then remove him or give him something he is allowed to do. Redirection is great for this age. And as spanking goes... he will only learn to fear you so I am glad you aren't doing it.<br>  <br>  Also... he is too young for time outs. That comes later in toddlerhood.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hang in there!!|`|ft8t98Pnaa	say NO... and move him from what he is doing.. or take it away.. or lightly slap his hand... you can spank him lightly... works for me|`|WPI0Z47saa	We did a time out on the bottom step. I always said "no" first and removed him from what I didn't want him to do and in return gave him something that he could do. I think that is very important since it is frustrating for them to always hear "no". So always give them an alternative. I would repeat this a couple of times but if they keep doing the same thing then I would place them on the bottom step for a minute and then try again.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	"No" is not going to work ... and in 9 months you'll come back here saying "my toddler walks around the house saying "NO!" all the time, what do I do????" ... at this stage I found it's best to distract and move them towards a more appropriate activity.  They have a very short memory.  <br>  <br>  If they were about to stick a fork in an electrical socket, then NO!!! is an appropriate response ... how a 13 month old would be left alone with a fork long enough to do that is another subject altogether; but it happens.|`|sU60NqWWaa	Are you open to just a small pop on the back of the hand or on the butt along with the word no?  That's not really spanking, and you certainly can't reason with a 13 month old.|`|m8alP5kPaa	Just be consistent with him, he'll get it eventually. Right now he's testing his bounderies to see what he can and can't get away with.|`|eqIdb16jaa	Make it clear that he's not supposed to do that certain task whatever it may be. Scold him if you have to and use an assertive tone. A 13 month old might not understand the language you are verbally speaking, but even babies understand the tone of your voice. As long as you use an assertive tone and make it clear that he's not supposed to do what he just did. He should understand "no."<br>  <br>  Give him a time out if he still fails to understand. :P

You doctor should be checking your baby's heartbeat at every appointment so you should know if something is wrong.  I'm willing to bet everything is fine.|`|820a73cf560f113ec7b4b70fb5270d0baa	you should be feeling some movement, like flutters.  they will be very suttle at this point.  Is this your first child?  with my first child i did not notice the movements early on like i did with my other pregnancies.  the younger you are and the firmer your stomach muscles are the harder it is to feel at first.  the baby may also be doing all its moving at night when you are sleeping.  i am 20 weeks right now and this little one does most of her moving when i lie down to go to sleep. have you had an ultrasound?  talk to your doc about your concerns.  if you are not having any complications, cramping, bleeding, etc. I would not worry about to much.  you will feel the movements soon.|`|8f5cdbb620c5dc4ec50e46b43bf0a233aa	If this is your first child, you may not know what to feel for. Don't worry about it. Everyone feels the baby at different stages of their pregnancies. <br>  <br>  If you're really worried, call your doctor.|`|0b34074ffaa102767c8414ece04a6a02aa	I am 24 weeks pregnant and I'm not feeling anything. I got an ultrasound not too long ago and he was big and healthy.. so I am sure you are just fine. It's very normal. Esp if this is your first child, they say that it is harder for you to determine what you are feeling in there. People sometimes mistakes the first kicks for gas and things like that. I'm sure your baby is moving around like crazy and you dont even realize that's what your feeling. I wish you the best of luck hun and congrats on the baby.|`|AA10241264	Don't worry too much. It may feel like gas bubbles in your stomach, a slight fluttering like a butterfly is caught in your belly. You may not realize it. JUST WAIT.

Your baby might<br>  have auburn (reddish-brown) hair. I do, but<br>  don't feel that way about your hair. If you want<br>  to dye your hair though, go ahead.

Is the red hair dominint or reseccive and the same with the brown hair.  Example if Red is resessive then it would be Rr and if the brown in dominint then BB you would get Rb, Br, Rb, Br.  Giving it a 50 percent chance.  I would guess auburn colored hair though.|`|69a042f31dc9317114c47be1471797f7aa	If its a girl, hope for red hair.

Please don't tell me that your eyes are green or I'll be dreaming of you all night...<br>  <br>  It will be a roll of the dice as to your baby's hair color.|`|AA11542491	Dominate trait means your baby most likely will have brown, or a slight mixture of the two. But if something amazing happens and he goes against the odds, the recessive trait MAY take over and he'll have rully red hair.
AA11226053	Soory you can not spoil a baby!  They cry because they need to be held , feed, put to sleep etc not to hear themselves|`|1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	Think about it this way:  A baby is a small person who is learning VERY fast.  How would you feel if you had to lie there with NO way to do anything, no way to move around, couldn't read, couldn't talk to make your wishes known, or ANYTHING else?  I think you'd crave stimulation!  That's what the baby is trying to tell you 90% of the time.  The baby isn't spoiled nearly so much as she is just plain bored.  I am NOT saying that this is your responsibility; first and foremost, it is the responsibility of the baby's parents to take care of her.  If you want to help, perhaps you can rock her while talking to her (talk about anything - it doesn't matter), or read nursery rhymes to her; even though she doesn't know what the words mean yet, she will quickly pick up on the rhythm of the words.  Talking to her is good too; tell her about what you're doing - once again, it doesn't matter whether or not she understand the words.  If it's nice weather outside, take her for a walk; lots of babies pick up on the rhythm of music, too.  Mostly, she's bored and wants to be doing *something*.  If you can help, you are being a very good and kind aunt to your little neice.|`|aadbc672ff509652b97f6931f5913dbaaa	You can not spoil a baby. My babies did exactly the same. Iused to think, How do they even know if I am sitting or standing? They are babies!! Bub probably just finds comfort in the movement. It could also be the way that bub is held is different when standing up. Perhaps for christmas you could buy them a baby sling. It would be a thoughtful gift that will allow bub to be carried but keep mum or dad's or your arms free so you can do other things and have baby close.|`|59224cc9c350f004c8d7be4e04e40501aa	babys cry for a reason! its possible the baby finds movement comforting, that doesnt make it spoilt.|`|AA10117437	Yes.  babies adapt quickly.  Before 3 months is really hard, though.|`|AA11724568	It is a baby and babies cry, it doesn't mean it is spoiled perse, although their could be some other physical problem that should be looked into. I am a single Dad and raised my son alone from the age of 18 months old and I do not agree that if you pick a baby up when it is crying that you are spoiling it, babies need lots of loving and physical contact. She may also be trying to communicate in some fashion or another as children like to experiment with their vocal cords.|`|01ef0137587ead6164d9d3f4a67ef386aa	Yes.  In orphanage with babies where there's not enough care that goes around, babies hardly cry because they're crying are ignored.|`|3c41db7098aec13b94e8d7aad644468faa	Baby, how old.

Then they won't cry so much.|`|AA11816973	It is very much possible to change aspoilt baby so long first you detect the root cause of such behaviour and deal with it or even seek advise and technical assistant to mature parents, pastor or child experts and you will see the changes but patience is also reqiure in such matters.|`|AA11908412	yes, if its time for the baby to sleep, put her down in her crib after getting her settled and leave the room, shut the door. <br>  Let her cry for a little while, don't go in the room, if she doesn't stop, go comfort her.<br>  It will not hurt her to cry for a little while, she will probably go to sleep.|`|eabac174b3b34983502e7042cd6bf99aaa	I don't believe you spoil a baby at least up to 10 months old. Sometimes they need you to stand to help them work out an air bubble or even get the bowel movements going. Remember it is hard to be a baby. Babies have all kinds of things happening to them and they have no way to communicate except by crying. Also sometimes babies need to cry. Especially the new ones because they need to exercise their lungs. I know the crying can get annoying sometimes but that is what needs to happen. I have 3 kids and a fourth one on the way and when they cry I just talk back to them. Sometimes that will settle them down, but not always. I say enjoy them while they are young.|`|f0ca85824e9381484bde9111e8176976aa	mother of 5 babies are ment to be held because they cant talk they get bored easly and want to see things like we do it amazes them if when my baby cries i find things to excite her such as her walker, her leap toy, toys that makes noise, she is 5 months and yes she is spoiled rotten that just shows you are a very attentive parent they go through stages taht they grow out of very quickly or the baby may be afraid and needs comfort . enjoy now cause when they are older like teenager which i have they dont want you to even look at them sometimes .
06240a02a5df6bd5c529cd2dfef4c18baa	If you were fertile Sept 2nd-5th then you probably conceived on Sept 5th or 6th, when your egg was actually released. there's no way of really knowing exactly, that's why they count pregancy from the first day of your last period rather than from the day of actual conception.|`|be6450592e312040df8cea3aaa4a11b6aa	It's too hard to pin it down to the exact day.  But in most cases, a woman ovulates for 24 hours, 10 to 14 days from the start of her period.  So the first day of your period was probably the 24th  if you ovulated between the 2nd and the 5th. The only way to figure out which day it was is with an early pregnancy sonogram, but they have to be done before 12 weeks (which in your case is too late). Just enjoy your prengnancy.. you have a better estimate than most pregnant women do!|`|a770fb4aa8b386bb928c5ad3e7be5547aa	You ovulate ONE day.You may have just been fertile those other days.

You are pregnant and a mother, or not pregnant.  If you are not pregnant, abstinence is the best way to prevent pregnancy, STDs and STIs, and the lack of peace that the sin of fornication brings.  If you are pregnant, you have to decide what kind of mother you will be.  Will you be the kind with a dead baby that your choice killed? or will you be the kind that gives the gift of life?  If you are not ready for a baby, consider adoption.   Many are waiting and hoping for a baby they can raise as their own.  You would be giving your child the gift of a home and life.  That is no more than your own child deserves.|`|2c04ade11b3b9fd06de29075ec1d75f4aa	If you're already pregnant you can't prevent it...|`|3aebd5e5e5ae1f8f6e05fbd7a9a0ea0eaa	consult a gynec|`|acb9e7c5787f79bae5b204f26749b5d1aa	From a medical standpoint, if your peroid was due the 14th it is too late for the morning after pill. (I am not advocating for this practice, just stating the information...I think this is what you were wanting to know) You can't "prevent" something that has already occured!  But you can prevent future pregnancies...please consider abstinence or at least monogamous intercourse with birth control AND STD prevention! I would take a home pregnancy test if you are already 5 days late...then, if it is + seek medical attention right away. I hope you will take responsibility for your actions and consider adoption if you are not ready or stable enough to become a parent yet!|`|f47e1e4a373bf274a9c224700333a231aa	There is not much you can do.

As long as you're cramps are not having you in terrible pain and their is no bleeding everything should be okay. But it's always better to ask your doctor so they can make sure everything is okay. How far along are you? I still had cramps into my 13th week.|`|3611dd343b52ab86dc008ba8ecc9dfa3aa	It can last the entire pregnancy. See what your doctor recommends for the pain.|`|fc41131d204462f6cd0fea5b768544eaaa	How far are you?  During the third trimester you will probably have cramping several times a day and it will keep getting stronger and happen more often until you deliver.
AA11400900	For a healthy pregnancy, you should wait a minimum of 18 months. That's the average time it takes for a woman's body to build itself back up after being depleted. The longest you should wait is 5 years. After that, you have a higher chance of miscarriage and pregnancy trouble.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, it's up to you. I know for myself, I would wait about 18 to 20 months: almost 2 years, so the kids would be close, but not too terribly close. They'll be friends, hopefully, but your first daughter will also be mostly potty-trained by then.<br>  <br>  It's really your choice and your partner's choice.

0a3ecde4cde9a9d580733f222785f56caa	First of all, take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, this decision is 99% yours to make. Since you are anti-abortion, don't get an abortion. I am pro-choice, but I don't think anyone who is anti-abortion should change this decision for anyone else. Don't let him trick you. Chances are if he says he won't be there for you if you do keep the baby, he won't be there for you if you don't. <br>  <br>  I don't think this man is good for you regardless. If you are pregnant and decide to keep the child, rather than give it up for adoption, you are strong enough to raise the child by yourself. I know it will be hard, but one strong mom and no dad is better than a frazzled mom and a deadbeat dad.<br>  <br>  Even if he refuses to be in your child's life, he cannot refuse to support your child financially. Take him to court and he will be forced to pay child support.<br>  <br>  Lastly, if you are not currently seeing a counselor about your bi-polar disorder, please do so. They can do amazing things in therapy these days, and it will help you to get well. Though you won't be able to take medications while pregnant (if you are), counseling will still help you make it through this difficult time.<br>  <br>  Good luck, honey.|`|AA10379545	Hi, hon.  I'm going to be blunt here, but it is out of honest concern for both you and your baby.  If you are already depressed and bipolar, I can tell you that aborting your child will only make everything a hundred times worse.  Not only will you being dealing with the normal stresses in your life, but you will have the burden of knowing that you paid someone to kill your baby, and that guilt will haunt you for the rest of your life.  If, on the other hand, you do not abort your baby, you will never regret it!  You can continue on in life knowing that you did the right thing and protected your son or daughter.  <br>  <br>  You have to remember that none of the circumstances of your life are your child's fault.  She did not ask to be conceived, and she does not deserve to die.  Your boyfriend is being a jerk, but that is not your baby's fault either.

7069bc06d3aab9e80903e557b29d3993aa	I had severe pre-eclampsia. I went full term because my dr was out of town. The morning he arrived back I went into labor. While he was away I went to the er and after care several times seeking help because I knew something was wrong. My doctor had watched my protein levels in urine and my blood pressure but never told me they were bothersome. When I would go to the er or after hours they would check my blood. When they were doing this it was to check my kidney and liver function! I delivered my son and two days after release I went back to after hours and insisted something was wrong. They told me the only cure was to have the baby so just to continue on bed rest. They did take blood at this time. The next morning we received a call from my dr telling me that the after hours faxed my blood work results to get the the emergency room immediatly. When I got outa bed my face was swollen and we went right to the er. I was hospitalized put on I.V. fluid to stop me from going into eclampsia and had a nurse that did not leave my bedside. I was only there 24 hours but my doctor called in a different doctor to care for me and I was then finally diagnosed.... with not just pre-e but severe pre-e! I had fluid on my brain, my kidneys were begingin to fail, and my liver was inflamed. I lost 20 lbs in 24 hours in fluid retentiopn. Meaning I urinated 20 POUNDS ! It was horrible. Ask more questions do more research. Alot of people dont know much about pre- eclampsia the best work I did was my own research. Do not let it go to far. You know your own body and if you feel uncomfortable at any time seek another doctors opinion! Good luck and if you are showing mild pre-e what the hell is the dr waiting for????? Severe????|`|AA11985760	Hi! I had pre-eclampsia when I was 35.5 weeks pregnant. I'm not sure about bloodwork, but the urine tests showed traces of protein, which is a symptom of the disease. High blood pressure is also a symptom, which is why pre-eclampsia is also called "PIH," or "pregnancy-induced hypertension." You might want to call your doctor and clarify what specifically is "getting worse." I was hospitalized so that they could monitor the protein in my urine and make sure it didn't get above 5000 mg, which is very high risk.<br>  <br>  I know that at one time, pre-eclampsia was called "toxemia" because they thought that there were toxins in the mother's blood that was making her sick.<br>  <br>  In any case, you are full-term and your baby will be fine if they induce you now. I was induced at 36.6 weeks, and while my baby was considered "low birth weight," she was perfectly fine and developed. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your pregnancy and good luck! You both will be fine.|`|AA10889725	Usually pre-eclampsia is determined by high blood pressure along with proteinuria (protein in urine), that is what determined mine. Elevated levels something is probably what they are looking for for. You're at 37 weeks so you're safe to have the baby now.
b0f1169c2e4176c7d4ef22c1b9dff6b9aa	Sorry!  All you can do is wait a few days and test agaon.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Since you're having sex without a condom you might also start worrying about STDS, HIV (it doesn't show up on tests for as long as 10 years...your boyfriend could be infected and the two of you would never know until he starts having symptoms and by then it will be too late for you), Chlyamida, it can cause yeast infections, as well as cycts on the ovaries and prevent you from conciveing when you WANT to have a baby.  Then there is HPV like HIV there is NO cure and HPV is spread by skin on skin contact, again it doesn't always present and your partner could have it for 15 years without an outbreak, but the virus can ALWAYS be spred to another person.  HPV is also a major cause of cervical cancer which will require the removal of your cervix as well as other reproductive organs rendering you sterile when you WANT to have children.|`|886dfafbd6f5644cc761edf6bd820abeaa	listen to me and listen good. in the future you MUST use more than just the Pill.  You have to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases.  Ever heard of that thing called HIV?  Please be more careful!<br>  if you're not ready to have a baby, then you're not ready to have unprotected sex.  having just had a baby myself, let me tell you, it's no joke.  it's hard work.  it's amazing and the best thing i've ever done in my life but it's incredibly hard work.  i cannot imagine how much harder it would have been if my baby were not planned, i not married with a supportive husband and secure financially.<br>  listen, you are probably fine.  this is probably God's way of saying to you, WAKE UP and take care of yourself!  <br>  All the best to you and your boyfriend.|`|AA10414356	if your doctor did a blood test and it came back negative you are most likley not preg<br>  when you miss pills use back up:)|`|AA12387077	If you keep stressing yourself out like this, you're likely to be late.  Stress makes a period late.  Calm down, and wait until you're a week or two late.  Also, sore breasts can mean that your period is about to come on.  It sucks having similar symptoms for different things!  My breasts get tender whenever I'm about to come on my period.  Turns out they were also sore during pregnancy #3.  Funny, they didn't get tender during the first two pregnancies!  Well, anyway, bottom line is this:  you're not even due for a period for another couple of days, so right now you're worried over nothing.  Try to relax and wait it out.|`|b5b009a98b7cebe3f45df454bd31149caa	Well, unfortunately you'll have to wait it out until your period really is late. A pregnancy test taken prior to the date of the next period can be inaccurate. On the other hand, breast tenderness is a common lead up to the menstrual cycle. You'll probably not turn up pregnant, but talk with your ob about changing your birth control method. For the forgetful amongst us, the Pill is not always a great choice. Discuss the Patch (once weekly) or the Ring (once a month) instead. Good Luck.|`|76452dd8c41b005f7fca834c5a3e12b9aa	i would say if you don't start your period soon then i would take a home pregancy test just to make sure your not pregnant|`|bdd15655c95f77981bca65e8c97209e8aa	youre probably alright, and not pregnant.<br>  breast soreness happens often w/ PMS especaly with birth control pills.
dd5e2df44d9ce0cb2e1f60d4a86d8fc8aa	I got pregnant on Depo.<br>  Not because I missed my shot or anything else I just fell in that nice little percentile of people that happens too.<br>  I had problems and symptoms like the one you are having now.<br>  If I had it to do all over again I would change my birth control ,not because I got pregnant but because Depo made my life miserable. <br>  See your doctor , then you two together can make the best choice for you.|`|03b3efb81802d41ae282a961d83c9e61aa	Take a test and/or try a new birth control.|`|AA10117437	I was on depo for years, and I never had a period.  I think 6 months of bleeding is a little unusual.<br>  <br>  Also, depo is a progesterone shot, and it will not affect the results of a home pregnancy test, which checks for HCG hormone.|`|2d9e0e9148447017052db088725c0ad4aa	Probably not.. Depo is strong my friend was on the depo and bleed for a year. After going off it took her 3 more years to conceive.
b2069bb286215e013b927962874b48a6aa	Yes, I have. I was 6 weeks pregnant when I found out. I woke up at 4am in severe abdominal pain. It felt like I had really bad gas pain at first and needed to go to the bathroom. I tried to go twice and nothing happened. So, I went out to our living room and sat down with a heating pad on my stomach thinking that I just had gas pain that wasn't ready to come out. (I know it sounds gross but, it's the best way I can think of to explain it.) <br>  <br>  After about 30-45 minutes of constant severe pain I woke up my husband and told him that something had to be wrong with me because the pain was so bad and it wasn't going away. I had just found out, the day before, that I was pregnant so that was the first thing that I thought of so I told him I wanted to go to the hospital. The entire car ride there was horrible. I swear I felt every single tiny bump on the road. <br>  <br>  Once there, the ER doctor had me take a urine test. He came in and told me I was definitely pregnant but, he thought the pain was caused by my appendix. He did a vaginal ultrasound and said that if I was 5-6 weeks what he was looking at was fine but, if I was 7 weeks something was wrong. Being that I knew pretty much when I got pregnany I told him that I couldn't be any more than 6 weeks. So, he said that it was my appendix and that he wanted someone from gyno to come down before they did anything else. I ended up throwing up twice and getting an iv in both arms while I waited. <br>  <br>  When she finally came down (about 1 1/2 hours later) she did a vaginal ultrasound as well. When she did it I thought I was going to die because of the pain. She said that I would probably be more painful when she did it because she wanted to check my fallopian tubes just in case. That's when I found out that I had a tubal pregnancy. Since I was in so much pain I had to have surgery to remove the pregnancy. But, even then she wasn't 100% sure if the pain was cause by the tubal or not. She said that they would go in and remove the pregnancy and then if they couldn't find a cause for the pain from it then a general surgery team would be standing by to come in immediately to remove my appendix and check for anything else.<br>  <br>  I won't go into anything that happened after that because it's all recovery stuff. But, what ended up being the problem was my right fallopian tube had ruptured. The removed my entire right fallopian tube along with the pregnancy. She told me that I was lucky that I woke up when I did because I could have bled to death and never have know what was going on. She said that it most likely ruptured when I woke up. <br>  <br>  By the time they went in to do the surgery I had close to a liter of blood in my abdomen and ended up losing over 1 1/2 liters in all by the time they were done with the surgery. I almost had to have a blood transfusion (I know people that have had this happen and had to have more than one). I ended up being anemic for several months afterwards.<br>  <br>  Ectopic pregnancy means any pregancy that is not in the womb. The most common kind happens in the fallopian tube, called tubal pregnancies. About 1 in 50 women have them and then after you've had one you usually are told you have either a 1 in 5 chance or a 1 in 3 chance of having another one. <br>  <br>  Ectopic pregnancies have to be terminate, either with medicinal therapy or surgery, usually laproscopic. They cannot be moved surgically to the uterus for several reasons, one being the tiny miniscule blood vessels that are formed once the implanted egg attaches and starts to grow (which is what happens normally in the uterus). <br>  <br>  The main reason why the pregnancy must be removed, beyond the obviousness of it not being in the uterus, is due to the lack of space in the fallopian tube. If your fallopian tube ruptures you could bleed to death internally. The only way to know if your pregnancy is a tubal one is to have a vaginal ultrasound. Normally they aren't that uncomfortable but, with the positioning need to see the pregnancy (and especially if the fallopian tube has already ruptured) they can be extremely painful. <br>  <br>  Doctors will normally go with medicinal therapy as long as you are not in any pain. If you are in severe pain they will do surgery on you because the tube has most likely ruptured (but they won't know until they actual do the surgery if this is the case). When they do the surgery, depending on where the pregnancy is in the fallopian tube, several things can happen. If it's too close to the uterus they might have to remove a section of the tube along with the pregnancy. Too close to the ovary (or attached to it) the ovary may have to be removed. If the fallopian tube has already ruptured the entire tube will be removed.<br>  <br>  These are all things your doctor should talk to you about before the surgery. The main thing to remember through it all is that when this kind of pregnancy occurs you have the right to feel however you want to. Some people immediately move on with their lives, most don't. You have a right to grieve irregardless of how short or long of a time you were pregnant. You also need to remember that there is absolutely nothing that you did that caused it. Many people have none of the risk factors but yet they have them (myself included). <br>  <br>  In the end, if you think you have one you need to go the ER immediately.<br>  <br>  Also please remember this is totally different from having a miscarriage. Neither one is worse or better than the other. They are just different. Grieving is similar but, in their own ways are still different. The way I explained what gets to me is that someone physically removed my baby from my body. That there was nothing wrong with my baby, it was just in the wrong place. That thought is upsetting in it's own way. Just as in what happens when a person miscarries.<br>  <br>  And as far as getting pregnant again, you still can even with a fallopian tube removed. Most doctors will tell you to wait at least 6 months being trying again. I think they say that more for the emotional and mental parts than the physical. My doctor said that physically I could try again after my first period (not the one that occurs right after surgery, the next one).|`|AA10117437	No, but I think you can see it on ultrasound.  Usual treatment is intrasmuscular methotrexate.  If that doesn't work, may need surgery to get it out.|`|a20b5e75d9aac13bee5b4d81bb71691daa	My mom had an ectopic pregnancy, she had bleeding and severe pain in her arm and shoulder, weird and I dont know how it is related but it is a common sign.

I HAD A MISCARRIAGE IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ECTOPIC AT FIRST. THEY HAVE TO TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY BECAUSE YOU CAN DIE. I KNOW THAT IT CAN BECOME VERY PAINFUL AT SOME POINT AND THE SOONER YOU GET IT TAKEN CARE OF THE BETTER BECAUSE YOUR TUBE COULD BURST AND DECREASE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING PREGNANT AGAIN. THEY GIVE YOU A PREGNANCY TEST AND THEN CHECK YOUR HCG (HORMONE LEVELS). I HAD TO GO IN 4 TIMES IN A WEEK FOR THEM TO KEEP TAKING BLOOD.

If there was a problem the ultrasound tech would have alerted the doctors. it is perfectly normal for unborn babies to have faster heart rates and will continue after they are born. They are busy developing and if it's awake and active it can raise. don't worry the baby is fine! you don't need to lower it at all!<br>  i'm sure the ultrasound woke the baby and was pushing on it which also raises heart beat.|`|987f4b809b5ceb4d48aa56fadd92dfc3aa	It is FINE.

9P2iO8Cfaa	Any playyard sheet will fit that, as they are basically standard size. The Graco ones are a bit scratchy, but the Koala Baby brand at Babies R Us is nice and fairly inexpensive. Target also sells a 2 pack for $10. Also, at BRU they have waterproof pads that go on the play yard. They are Especially for Baby brand and they are $6.99 for two. There is a little picture of a play yard on the top of the package. They are designed for play yards, bassinets and cradles. They are not fitted, but you can put the pad down and cover with a fitted sheet and it will stay put. This is what I did and it works perfectly. My play yard pad looks like new and it is 4 years old.|`|NLN9JmrMaa	They sell play yard sheets. You will find them in the aisle w/ the play yards at Babie's R' Us on an endcap. Target has them too with the crib sheets. I have 2 of the sheets and just switch them out to use. The padding can be wiped down, but if you use it without a sheet it will get drool/spit up stains on it. I have never seen a waterproof pad to go on it, just the sheets.

AA12175970	I just read that you should wait one year after your hcg level returns to zero. I looked it up, because I have never heard of a molar pregnancy.|`|NLN9JmrMaa	My friend was told to wait 3 mo.....she waited 6 mo. instead....then it took her about 5 to concieve.|`|cZ4QSdREaa	Just six weeks.  After the D&C my ex just needed to time to recover from that and give her system time to adjust again.  A molar comes from cells lacking any DNA and the body treats it as a pregnancy.  Six weeks, just like after delivery of a healthy baby was all we needed.  Ask your Dr. though as there may be complications.

H9LZz6CRaa	lol I have 4 children they hiccup inside you I laugh because that is the weirdest feeling.  My bottom actually moved with their hiccups.  Anyway you hiccup because of what you eat or how fast you eat.  Also because of the why the baby is laying inside of your belly.  I hiccuped so much with my first baby that I had to tell myself each time that it was the babies why of saying Hi mom I love you.  That way I would smile instead of getting upset about them.

NLN9JmrMaa	Stretch marks come from the inside out...they are caused MOSTLY by hormones and only a little by stretching skin. They are also pretty much hereditary...if mom has a lot, you probably will too. Creams will help prevent dry skin and keep you from scratching, but nothing can prevent them. They will fade over time. Keep them out of the sun.|`|WLOh218taa	i've used bio-oil, though i didn't see results. use shea butter. it worked wonders for me in weeks. peeling can occur a little, but it's nothing bad. and it's CERTAINLY better than stretch marks. ^_~|`|acvkOLizaa	I haven't tried bio oil, but I've been using the Johnson's baby oil gel. I'm 7 months along, and dont have a single stretch mark. When I'm about to get out of the shower, I rub it all over my stomach and stuff. I sometimes use a sugar scrub from bath and body works. Its amazing. It lightly scrubs off any dry skin...then the oils lube you up so well! Word of advice...don't get the generic kind if you try it. I tried the equate version, it doesn't work as well.|`|b7a315289aa51531550bd46b7190a7faaa	stretch marks are caused by the breaking of the dermis - the deepest layer of skin. There is no cream or lotion or oil that can penetrate and replace the collagen in order to repair stretch marks. It is not like breaking a bone - your body can rebuild but the broken part is still there. It is basically a scar under the skin. The reason why some people swear by certain remedies is because stretch marks fade over time by themselves - all products you see mentioning "curing" or "fading" stretch marks? They will tell you it can take weeks, months for the product to work. Well the fading would have happened even if you didn't use the product. that's why people think they work - because the marks were fading anyway!<br>  <br>  There is some small evidence that Vitamin E oil and a prescription Tretinoin can help with stretch marks but both claims are tenuous and not really proven. Vitamin E oil works because it is a major component in the making of collagen and is the only product that can penetrate the epidermis to any extent. Whether or not this actually helps rebuild the tears in the dermis, no one is sure because, as I said, most stretch marks fade over time anyway!<br>  <br>  The best thing yu can possibly do to avoid them is to keep your growing belly from being strained by holding it up - a girdle or whatever - thus putting less pull of gravity ont he skin. I've used vitamin E oil on my skin because it's a nice emolliant and eases itching but I got stretch marks from my first child an none from any others. It's really a crap shoot, unfortunately. Laser surgery is about the only thing you can really do to "cure" stretch marks.
6dd3b3d2fe124f88e2ea1a1960529243aa	It could be stress, but you may want to check the underlying problem.<br>  It could be that she pulls her hair back too tightly, or a hormone imbalance...if the adrenal glands or pituitary glands under-produce or over-produce, then this can cause baldness.<br>  You may want to check to see if she has any other 'symptoms'.<br>  The feeling of stress can also be caused by a hormonal imbalance.|`|AA10804824	Wow, it could totally be stress.

It is a type of psychological condition that involves strong urges to pull hair, generally triggered by stress or anxiety.  <br>  <br>  People with trichotillomania pull hair out at the root from places like the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, or pubic area. Some people pull large handfuls of hair, which can leave bald patches on the scalp or eyebrows.<br>  <br>  Trichotillomania is a medical condition, it's not something most people can just stop doing when they feel like it. People with trichotillomania usually need help from medical experts before they can stop. With the right help, though, most people overcome their hair-pulling urges. This help may involve therapy, medication, or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have suffered through this for 18 years.  You or your daughter can email me if you need someone to talk to.|`|9zA0yyioaa	There are many things that can cause such a thing, anything from lack of vitamins to poor hygiene to some types of deseases.<br>  <br>  Stress can cause it too, but she would have to be stressed very often. I would not really concern myself with it right now.|`|F9qCsIrgaa	Im a teen, and I am a very very stressed person. I am not sure but I may loose more hair when I'm stressed too.

But sometimes the really early ones survive just fine and full term babies have complications.  Every pregnancy is different.  As with labor, sometimes the doctors have to break the water for you and other times it breaks and then the doctors wait and wait and eventually they will give meds to induce labor.  If you are having your first, then the best indicator of how your labor will be is your mom's and any sisters experiences.  Ask them about how theirs went, while not always true there is some heredity to it.  As far as how long baby will cry after born Again there is a big difference between each baby.  Some babies will cry from the minute they are out till they get tired.  Others will only cry when they are doing something to it to make him/her cry.  Neither is bad or a sign of trouble.  Doctors like to hear a baby cry at least a little so they can get an idea of lung function.  Unfortunately pregnancy and birth have alot of uncertainties.  Try not to worry, try to enjoy the process and count your blessings along the way.|`|46631a2fa6dd6668839d7e5fc2a81b80aa	A baby can be born when you are 37 weeks pregnant and not have any problems. Your baby should be born with in 24 hours of you water breaking, Drs won't let it go that far unless you are ready to push because of the risk of infection. It is very important to go to the hospital right away if your water breaks. After baby is born they will cry until they are swaddled and cuddled and fed. Then they cry when they need or want something (or they just want to cry to exercise their lungs).|`|20bfe8c5badbbabc7c371ba1c5861f77aa	most docs agree that to be have fully developed lungs (which r the last thing to develop) is the key to a healthy baby at delivery, and that happens at about 32 weeks usually. babys have been born at as early as 24 and been o.k. my nephews were born that early and were less than 2 lbs a peice though. i'm not sure about the water breaking, but i know it can be awhile. if the babies not born within 24 hrs they would usually do a c-section. and the baby usually cries only after the doc has suctioned lungs, and wiping him off and stuff|`|2e7e6dd62cb46f9729156097e3f7e12caa	IT ALL DEPENDS UPON THE PERSON, WHEN I WAS PREGNANT, MY WATER BROKE AT 10:34P.M., I DIDN'T HAVE MY SON UNTIL12:27A.M.

Usaully after 27 weeks the viability goes up and 34 weeks there are fewer issues. Most Drs want ya delivered within 24 hrs of water breaking due to risk of infection.  Depends on the baby.|`|y2lbDkepaa	I am only 35 wks and 4 days and they are wanting to possibly induce me next Thursday if my fluid levels are not where they think they should be. That would make me 36 wks and 2 days along. They are not even going to check his lungs b/c they think he is far enough along to make it thru this.. maybe a day or 2 in the NICU. I am freaking out .. but I do not want anything to happen to him on the inside. But they say that babies can survive after 28 wks, but there will most likely be problems for the 1st couple of months. On the water breaking it usually doesn't take that long.. if it breaks on it's own .. it could be a couple of minutes to couple of hours. Now if the doctor breaks it early it can take a while, b/c you will have to push the baby down. And usually the baby cries for a few seconds at birth.. only b/c they are making them cry to see how clear their lungs are. If baby sounds aren't what they are expecting then they will have oxygen and visit the NICU. Hope I helped some.. good luck.
ZMZ1IsPWaa	With the last description of your bowel movements, it sounds like you're in labor now or soon will be.  You can try soaking to relieve the contractions as well as by drinking plenty of water.  You may just end up having a longer labor than some women.  It sounds like you are on your way though.  <br>  <br>  About the fluid - it could be amniotic fluid but the only way to know for sure is to have the PH test done and you should do so ASAP.  A ruptured membrane is nothing to wait around with - your risk of infection and infection in the baby goes up with each passing hour if that's what it is.  Different positions may lead to different leakage but I found at the end of my pregnancy that I was a lot "wetter' than normal and took to wearing a panty liner.  To be safe, I recommed you call your OB/Midwife and see if they want you to come it to see if it's your water.  Don't worry about going in again - if it's your first it's hard to know when to go.  However, when it is real labor you will know it - the contractions as you go along should get longer and more intense as time goes on.  Keep track of length from the start of one to the start of the next like you have and give them a score on a scale of 1-10 for pain and keep track of how long they last.  This might also help your OB/Midwife better help you.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope your labor isn't too long nor too painful!<br>  <br>  Call the OB!|`|NLN9JmrMaa	If you lie on your back then the flow should increase if it's your fluid. However, if you even think it's your fluid you need to go get the fern test. Once your water bag opens even a little, the baby needs to be born with in a certain time period or you are opening up your body to infection which can harm you and endanger baby. Better safe than sorry.

Hang in there and I hope you don't have to be preggers all summer...phew! Make sure you are drinking a lot of water.

I'm usually cold natured, but while pregnant the air was always on 70 and there was a fan aimed at me.
kLyovgnmaa	It could be too soon to tell, or you could just have a nasty virus. Vomiting alot will take the energy out of anyone. A blood test can usually pick up on the pregnancy hormone within the week of conception. Some women may show a little later. Think of the last time that you had sex, and then go from there. Good luck!|`|5JB1fHz9aa	i don't know everyone is different.  i took a pregnancy test on the day i was supposed to get my period and coincidently i had a GYN appointment that day...just the yearly one to get on birth control. so when i went i told them that i had taken a preg test and it was positive...i mean the second line was sooooo light you really had to angle it to see but it was there.  after a few days i called to see what the results were and my HCG level was really low.  unfortunately soon after that i had a miscarriage. anyway my point is that with a blood test they will be able to tell if you are pregnant or not.  i know someone right now that is going through invitro fertilization and they just implanted the eggs and in just a week they will know weather or not she is pregnant.  but like i said in the beginning maybe everyone is different im just saying from what i know personally.|`|6227a43944409594bccf255ffe0366ddaa	Probably to soon to tell|`|818GINrcaa	I believe that it may have been to soon.

"Baby dust to you"|`|IYwmDe7jaa	I have not heard of a blood pregnancy test come back negative and you are, I have heard of home pregnancy's test come back negative and you really are, that happened to me, you have a certain number/level of hormones in your body when you are not pregnant, when you get pregnant the hormone level increase even being a little pregnant, a blood test picks up on it better then the urine, so you probably are not. I would go back to the doctors to see what is going on. and if you wont ask for another pregnancy test to be done no harm in it.|`|d7e5cdf9004a0407953d5ca2a4851189aa	Do check if you eat too sweet food or drink.

(Of course we all know you can pregnant at any point in your cycle, so who knows.)  Supposedly this happened to an acquaintance.  For her, it was 3 mos of false tests and she was pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Honestly it doesn't sound like a definite pregnancy.  Most people don't start feeling sick until they're about a month along (so, say in 3 more weeks).  Anything's possible.  Just sit tight, take care of yourself, rest, and wait for your period.  If it doesn't come in 2 wks (mine's sometimes late if I've been sick), head back to the dr (or the pharmacy to get a urine pregnancy test).  Good luck!|`|G1ngFhXoaa	it could defantly be too soon to tell. wait a week and see if you get your period than if not go to the dr again if you still feel crappy. tiredness could also be coused by your coming period. as well as sore breasts.good luck|`|PDaF6metaa	its not too soon with a blood test you are not pregnant  somethng else is wrong your getting / are sick. I had irregular periods all my life still do going sometimes 4 months with no period since 13 yrs of age and so for 25 years I thoght I couldnt get pregnant I was wrong. (happily twice) but a blood test would have shown it at ANY POINT IN TIME ask the MD for provera that will stop ur aching breasts etc and hormonal  imbalance which you have per your symptoms and within a week your period will come. I have had the same symptoms of pregnancy and I never was pregnant except for when I CHOSE to be and given my history of such extreme erratic periods again I as surprised I could have kids. Also PROVERA is NOT a morning after pill nothing of the sort something threw ur period schedule off per the preg symptoms provera balances them back and u get ur period. But it does sound like your quite sick or getting sick.|`|UhVrGtc8aa	Blood tests are fairly accurate even this early, but nothing is 100% accurate until your expected period has been missed.

icEi1CgNaa	That sounds like more than just teething to me, especially the vomitting. none of my kids did that. I would make an appt. with your doctor especially as the pain reliever didn't work and little ones can get dehydrated so easily with the symptoms you described.<br>  <br>  With my three kiddos, they cut their bottom teeth almost simultaneously, so the second one is coming soon. The uncomfortableness and crying is inevitable each time they teeth though, but in this instance is probably to to a tummy ache/stomach virus :(<br>  <br>  You've tried all the right things for teething (although the freezer for the teething ring might be too cold for her, the fridge is best.) I hope your baby feels better soon.|`|0ofdNP8Zaa	I would contact your doctor.  It sounds like it could be more than teething.|`|KdX666bLaa	it can all depend maybe she is sick but as far as the second following the first they can come in within days of each other or even the same time teething is hard on both mom and baby but they have to come in hang in there try giving tylenol and after 2 hours give her ib proufen then 2 hours tylenol then i b profuen that way by alternating them they get the right ammount of time between doses good luck|`|O7Hta3Q8aa	When in doubt, don't attribute baby's behavior to teething. Let your doctor decide. Yet, here are some general ways to tell the difference between teething and an illness such as an ear infection: <br>  <br>  1. Teething mucus is clear saliva and doesn't run out the nose. Cold mucus is thick and yellow. A nasal discharge usually means an allergy or an infection, especially if accompanied by eye drainage. <br>  <br>  2. Teething rarely causes a fever higher than 101° F (38.3° C). <br>  <br>  3. Teething may be confused with an earache. Babies pull at their ears during teething, probably because of pain radiating from the teeth to the ears. Some babies just like playing with their ears. Ear-pulling in babies is an unreliable sign. With an ear infection babies usually hurt more lying down and have accompanying signs of a cold. <br>  <br>  4. Babies don't act progressively sicker with teething. As a general rule, when in doubt, have your doctor check it out.|`|5a944937f1bb14fc72af9e56e14479f2aa	vomiting diarrhea and fever aren't actually symptoms of teething, If you are breast feeding just keep doing it to give her all the antibodies and immune support. if not then find an N.D. and ask about Colloidial Silver with goats milk or almond milk for a substitute|`|y4HzI7znaa	I'm no doctor, but you should defiantly see one, and first stop giving her stuff, because that could make it worse, you never know, just be a little more careful|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Votmiting and loose stools arent a symptom of cutting a tooth, some parents may say there child has runnier stools but vomiting deff isnt a symptom. I think she's sick, nothing more.|`|ZxZOi5wraa	I'm pretty sure the timing of her first tooth is totally unrelated to the timing of her other teeth.  Do you see a blister or a second tooth coming in?  I'd say that these symptoms sound like teething symptoms, but if you are unsure, maybe you should contact your ped.  Try getting one of those cheesecloth self-feeders and stick an ice cube in it.  My daughter loves that.
GuVbRKj6aa	Get him on a schedule. He needs alot of play time throughout the day, and some kind of bed time ritual. I used to give my kids a bath every night before they went to be. This was their transition. They knew that after their bath came bed time. I read a book and off to la la land they went. I would get them up in the morning for breakfast and their daily routine. They always knew what came next. If he doesn't sleep till late at night, get him up early, play and tucker him out. He will eventually be tired enough at a reasonable hour for you to put him down.|`|AA11258331	First of all, the child needs to be on a schedule.  Have him<br>  get up early in the morning and not let him take a nap during<br>  the day and he should go to bed at a proper time. Leave a<br>  light on in his room so he won't be afraid.|`|a43350ec23333f4fdc3a87408403ad7eaa	DEAR<br>  <br>  HE IS REALLY SCARED OF THE DARK SO PRETTY PLEASE REUSE THE NIGHT LIGHTS AND GO BUY A MUSICAL MOBILE THAT SHINE ON THE WALL OK<br>  <br>  TAKE CARE|`|Lwe4C6nKaa	Try putting a night light in his room ask him what could you do to make feel more fomfortable. try give a a sweet milk. try staying with him until he fall asleep. that always work with my little cousin. good luck|`|SWa4XqOaaa	Have you tried giving him a bath in the lavender baby wash? Try that, plus maybe if an hour or so before you try to have quiet time so he is calm and ready for bed.  As for the night terrors try to find him a favorite toy or blanket for him to sleep with and maybe have him talk to it, maybe that will calm him down. Good luck.
JhlatX7maa	Yep =) its still good to have your doctor check and if ehr head was down its probably her hand you feel in your pelvic area, but as long as your cervix is closed and all you are good to go. My daughter dropped or so i thought around 25 weeks I went to get checked and they were like nope shes still up there and i had all the symptoms you had, but again always get your doctor to be sure =) Good Luck|`|3ed5f1f856a0efb5cdb9b8be224b8702aa	Haha...same with my little boy. I'm 21 weeks. He loves staying low. It sucks because I feel him kick my vaginal area. It feels weird. I wish he would move up a little more. I believe it's normal, many babies don't move up till about 26 weeks. <br>  <br>  Congrats on your baby girl, and good luck on the rest of your pregnancy.|`|AA11379643	yes it's normal.  I'm 28 weeks and up until last week my son was breach all the way.  He finally flipped himself around and I pretty much feel all his kicks around my belly button or in that vicinity.|`|73f68bc8ffbbc3f6be93b55778882e67aa	Yes hun, if the Dr isn't worried, then don't worry yourself over nothing!  I carried my girl high and the boys low!|`|AA12314337	that's where mine are too. I wouldn't worry. my baby was sitting breach as well.|`|QL976Tf5aa	This is normal. There is actually a myth that if the baby is low then it will be a boy. While the myth has no credit, the simple fact that it says if it's low means that having a low baby is normal.|`|ZxZOi5wraa	My daughter was very low, as you are describing.  I had a completely normal pregnancy, though it did get VERY hard to walk at the end.  For the last 5 weeks or so, I felt like I could feel her head on my pubic bone.  I actually had pains down there that worried me, but there really wasn't anything to worry about.  She was head-down for my entire pregnancy and stayed that way through labor.|`|AA10652097	yeah that's normal.  i was the very same way.  you're still early in your pregnancy, so that baby has a lot of room to flip around constantly.  it's nothing to worry about until you are approaching 40 weeks.  by that time, most babies flip head down on their own.|`|AA11916244	Its expecially normal when you have already had a baby. All your muscles are looser so the baby will lay much lower. I did with my second and boy was it painful!|`|d89103e07596535084f2b09fdd9790efaa	Welcome to being pregnant with a girl. Im 32 weeks and she's been low for a while. My 2 boys were much farther back. Just a word of advice, if you are still wearing maternity pants that fit below the belly it time to change to those wonderful panel pants. You wont feel so uncomfortable.
9e8bea97efbc891b722dac1cd407d35baa	I had an ekg as a kid (I was about 6 so it was some time ago)and I had long, thick hair but they didn't shave my head they just brushed it to one side before sticking them on all over the place. I can't see them going backwards technology wise, so you, or rather he, should be fine.<br>  <br>  Oh and it didn't hurt or anything either.|`|18fa09ea50eedfe616b5d39863054b7caa	I work in the Medical Field and I have not heard of this.  If you have a brain injury or something like that they might have to to monitor you.  I have had an EKG and they did not shave my head, you just have to be real still.  Just remember EKG's make some funny noises that could scare some people.  Just remember there is someone there that can help you should something happen.  I had a good experience and really nice people treated me.  Be sure to ask them any questions you might have they love giving answers!|`|pvE7ZMPIaa	They don't shave the persons hair. My little brother, Nathan, had something similar done to him. When my two little brothers was playing Nathan would stop breathing and he would fall backwards and act tired. The doctors put sticky things on his chest and head. They would put your son under while they do the test because he is only one. Nathan just terned two and he is still going through the test because they still do not know what is wrong.|`|y2lbDkepaa	No I had an EEG 5 yrs ago after the birth of my son. They have this glue type stuff that they will place in different spots and it will hold for the scan. It may take about 3 washes to get it out.. but there was no need to shave my head. I had long hair at the time as well. He will be fine with his hair in place. Good luck.|`|3e03cfeb1ce3e4ed640a6a1c7b02264caa	Do you mean EEG brain scan?  Ekg is for your heart.  I worked in an office, that did these tests and the tech never shaved a single head, the whole time I worked there.  So I would, ask another person in that office if that is really needed..  Or call another pediatric neurology office and just ask, it they shave the head or they can work around the hair.  The tech's at our office, just glue the electrodes on the scalp, while moving the hair to the side.  Check it out!!!<br>  Happy Health to your son!|`|9c5d199632daf00d5672fd58255cec1caa	My son had that at age one as well. He didn't find it very comfortable having the electrodes attatched or having them removed, but once they stopped fidgeting with him he settled down. My son was an overnight observation so the sticky stuff had plenty of time to settle in. It was a nightmare getting him to get a bath and allow me to wash that stuff out of his hair. No, they didn't shave it, but it certainly was sticking up everywhere.. even between the bandages they put on his head (to keep him from pulling on the electrodes). It doesn't hurt, just uncomfy and time consuming if they use the individual electrodes instead of the cap. I wish you the best of luck and hope that all turns out well.

NLN9JmrMaa	Wake her up and take her to the bathroom when you go to bed. She should prob. only need to go once in the night.......maybe then she won't wake up and call for you. Also, make sure to put her in undies that are a size big so they are easy for her to get up and down...if it's not too cold, just have her sleep in undies and a t-shirt so she can manage her clothes even when she's groggy. She's probably just disoriented and tired so it's easier to cry for you than to manage it all.|`|AA12252571	Through all 3 kids and one grandchild I don't think there is an answer to this. Not one that doesn't make the child feel "alone". I always went with them. I made them quit drinking about an hour and a half to two hours before bedtime so they would sleep all night but if they woke up I would go with them. They eventually do it themselves when they hit about 4 or 5 years old.|`|a61e01fa9a373d19655e53f895483001aa	I know this isn't the answer you're looking for, but I think you need to accept the fact that your daughter is still too young to take care of this in the night alone.  I get up at least once a night with my 3 year old; while I don't like it, she is just too little to be up in the night by herself, let alone taking care of "business".  I won't make her do it alone till she's four or five, probably.|`|hqZxrtCvaa	Well she is scared, and maybe she is too young to be using the bathroom by herself. What if she falls in the toilet head first. No, I wouldn't allow my toddler to use the bathroom by herself. I know this is hard on you, but maybe you can put a potty in your room and tell her to come into your room and just to use the potty. Maybe she won't feel all alone then. Another thing I would recommend is to limit the amount of fluids you are giving her before bed, as she shouldn't be getting up several times or even every night. Another thing I could recommend is a reward chart. you could reward her with stickers or a healthy treat!!|`|qNEYlqeAaa	If you find out I'd like to know.  Unfortunately I don't think there is an easy fix for this one.  Its just gonna take time.|`|f7f979166d56e9db52bddbf243ac866daa	I agree that she's just too young to be up handling things alone at night.  If you don't want every one in the house aake.  Then get up immediately when she calls.  You'll get more sleep in the long run getting up for those few minutes than if you lie awake waiting for her to quit calling and end up getting up anyhow.  You don't want her to reverse her tactics and start wetting the bed because she can't go to the potty alone anyhow.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Keep in mind that this is the first time in your daughter's life that she has been the only person awake in the house. I remember when I was a child and if I had a nightmare, I'd stand outside my parents' door before I could work up the courage to walk in because I didn't want them to be mad. Granted, I was slightly older than your daughter, but she is used to waking up and having you be ready to see her. Maybe try sticking some pictures of you and your husband with her across from her potty so she sees you. Another option might be to put a small radio in the bathroom and leave it on so that it's not so quiet when she goes in-a quiet house can be scary. OR, you and your husband could record a special message for her each night and let her push the play button herself so that she has a new message from you to look forward to when she goes potty in the middle of the night. Just be sure to explain it to her when she's awake so that she knows what to do. Another idea might be to have her come wake one of you before going into the bathroom, you can unzip her from your bed, send her to the bathroom and come back to be zipped up. That way you aren't physically getting up to help her and she's not screaming the entire household awake. Good luck!|`|9gMAWt6Faa	Get your butt out of bed and help her, for cryin' out loud!!!!!!!!!  Tell her to come and wake you up so everyone else can get sleep.  If she has only been potty training for X amount of months, you should be happy she at least wakes up to go.  But expecting her to do it herself in the middle of the night is LAZINESS!!!!!!!!!!|`|a3fc2d5c05f9c2bc5f111a4881390418aa	Um....keep helping her till she's more comfortable alone.

It takes awhile but she will get there. Seeing that she gets to the bathroom by herself it shouldnt take long.<br>  <br>  How old is she? <br>  My daughter is 4 and has only just now started going by herself during the night and I am quite proud of her. But with my oldest I always had to help her as she wouldnt wake up properly, she'd sleep walk and tell me and then I'd have to guide her to the bathroom etc.<br>   But they do eventually learn, but as she has just started potty training give her a break. It great that she knows to get to the bathroom in the first place. But imagine waking up confused and needing to go but scared as your all alone and its dark. Of course she needs help. Just give her time and she will learn.|`|ef88a8ae3afde5ec4c890c32c8b9c3faaa	Stop giving her any liquids 2 hours before bedtime, make sure she empties her bladder before bed time and then she won't be getting up during the night.  Other than that, perhaps you should tell her 'big girls' go to the bathroom quielty by themselves all of the time.

But of course its possible so you could go get a blood test done. <br>  As far as the pregnacy signs they could just as easily mean that your period is just around the corner.<br>  The clear watery dischanrge, cramps, increased appetite, sore boobs are all premenstrual symptoms so i wouldn't look into that too much.<br>  Your doc will shed some light on it by doing a blood test. Good luck!|`|AA11404113	You may be manifesting pregancy symptoms if you want to be pregnant.  It may be a little too soon for the test to work.  Try to relax and try the test again in another week if you don't start in the meantime.  If you don't have a history of irregular periods, you are probably pregnant and its just too soon for the test to show positve.|`|0UiMqIjDaa	I have irregular periods and every time I miss one I get so excited at the thought of being pregnant, that I actually make myself get the symptoms! I feel sick, I get cravings, I have tender breasts, and on it goes. When my period eventually does come I am very disappointed and the symptoms disappear immediately. I hope this is not the case with you. Try testing in another week. Good luck.|`|786f9bf5f0b909d313b2b47c1d0f9de1aa	not all hpt will giv u a correct result...do another test in a week time...for me i will be satisfied with 2 or 3 hpt result that shows positive go to www.peeonastick.com|`|cxngz2kyaa	hun... dont stress.. go to your docs and get a blood test.. it really sounds like you are BUT to be sure go to the docs.. good luck
06240a02a5df6bd5c529cd2dfef4c18baa	If your period is 6 days late why don't you just take a test? That's the easiest way to know for sure!|`|AA12175970	I was around 4-5 weeks when I started to get bloated. Didn't even know I was pregnant, but that was my very first clue.|`|AA11658888	Its time to take a test.|`|r6WJgDoXaa	When I was prego, I felt bloated at about three weeks, this was my first and only early clue!!<br>  Take a test!
AA11920812	You could be rather surprised once he takes the test.  My hubby and I went through the same torture!  We tried for three years to have a baby before we conceived my son.  We were convinced he had a problem.  He even worked at a nuclear power company and got a large dose of radation (a years worth in less than 30 seconds).<br>  <br>  In fact, a doctor confirmed he did.  The doctor recommended a surgery to open his sperm making vessels so more sperm could come out.  After resarching the surgery and finding how unreliable the surgery was we got a second opinion from a reproductive endocronologist.<br>  <br>  The r.e. had a lab on site.  So, this time when he took the test it revealed a low sperm count, but not nearly as bad as the first doctor found.  This is because the sperm were sitting in lieu while I registered at hospital, went back to lab, sat and waited for my name to be called, gave speciman and filled out forms.  All taking 45 min to an hour.  And, destroying the sperm in the process.  What a crock!<br>  <br>  We also discoved I had a problem.  Both were very minor, but had we treated hubby and not me we'd still be childless.  We ended up conciving a year later :)) And, our son was born last March.<br>  <br>  Once all that stress was over and we had our baby in our arms we couldn't have been happier!! Or, any more tired :)) Then, when ds was 7 1/2 months we discovered we were pregnant again, lol.<br>  <br>  I just wanted to give you encouragement!!  I know how hard it is to be going that route.|`|11fdb1b51bac432151eb6062e3bcad23aa	Good luck to both of you i hope that you both are blessed with lots of children.|`|0b67e653d1404d2f4d3545719c89994daa	I wish you the best of luck, and lots of baby dust. Sorry about your disappointment, I know how it feels, I've been there before too.|`|NLN9JmrMaa	Get married. It will reduce your stress level and make you feel more secure in your relationship........make it easier to conceive.|`|c7f2057ca2950a73fb0c359e6fc4d29eaa	i hope you can. I hope you are blessed with children|`|e99701b33e18214451b6552d48b7c0b1aa	well, good luck to you both. Give yourself some time and tell him not to be so down on himself. If you want a baby bad enough, you will find an option that will work out for you both. Even if it means adopting a baby. Besides, there is a great chance that nothing is wrong with him at all, it could be that you are just limited on your egg count, and if that is the case, then you have a lot of options! Good luck|`|f43e8999e61238884f0471e1bca06073aa	Good luck and best wishes! I know it is hard when all you truly want is to have a family. Keep your chin up and get all the testing done so the doctors can help you! take care
wdRDfWqwaa	1 year, but you need to check with your DR at the 12 month appointment.  Some babies need to stay on formula longer because they need the nutrients or aren't gaining enough wait.  So check with your DR at the 12 month appointment.|`|AA11603761	Do you mean to soy milk?  My guess is about 1 year old.  Make sure you buy organic non-gmo soymilk though.|`|2b2039f87a24493d348609af3cc01f39aa	1 year!|`|0BZYy4o8aa	My doctor said 11 1/2 months - most people say 1 year....|`|f5b11b180bd29536f64b98272b057fb5aa	I switched from soyforumula to soy milk at a year per the doctor's approval. At 18 months we switched from soy mik to cows milk.
VDKkzLt4aa	dont panic, give it 5 days, if these things continue and u dont have your period, than u could be pregnant. sometimes, u are not pregnant but its just hormones that keep changing and the resulting symptoms.|`|3bec5985bd2a36190bfe576126411e59aa	Go to a clinic, or they sale them at dollar trees ((were everythings a dollar))  Those are all tha syptoms i had and im 8 wks. and 4 days!|`|OtmOeHvuaa	You could go to a walk-in Clinic...I would think u may be...those are the signs I have...and I'm 8 weeks now with my second.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|a7c4c69ab8e9cad66cccb33cbed6627eaa	you could be but dont stress because you may not be but relax and good luck|`|3e84fefafa86e84da4c15fdc0df80738aa	You can't take a test until 5 days before your missed period anyways.  Instinct will usually let you know anyways.
mPODUVh3aa	No your baby is about the size of a pea and it is just above or even behind your pubic bone.  If you are having recurring pain at the top of your stomach, and you haven't been throwing up a lot from morning sickness, it is something else.  You should consult your obstetrician.
mPODUVh3aa	If your BMI% is good (above 20%) and you have a period, then you are fine.  Don't go on a strict diet, or one that only requires protein.  Just reduce portion size and make good choices.  Eat veggies first until you can't eat anymore, then meat and if you are still hungry then eat carbs.  But it shouldn't affect your ability to conceive.|`|9xUwXy95aa	Seek the advise of a gynaecologist on this. Some people may do it and get away with it while others won't. Your doctor knows u better and will be able to offer medical advise.|`|91580eed17d6767f4f7dbd022b2c2213aa	I don't know if it is successful or not but I"m TTC and trying to lose a little bit of weight b/c I read that it was easier to conceive at a "normal" weight.

You're under the heading of pregnancy so are we talking about your stress or the baby's stress? How pregnant are you?  With that info someone might be able to assist you.
AA10219752	Your parents need to monitor your computer time more often. It must really be sad being you. Maybe you need to meet new friends or just a friend<br>  You have asked this question about 6 times<br>  it sounds like you havent found the chuckle you are looking for.|`|AA11974580	you're not pregnant|`|2e127a9cbfd8839eaf5feac84eab90b8aa	Ok , you can't get pregnant from a finger that may or may not had come on it.second of all go ask your mom how she got pregnant. My brain hurts now|`|80da970cc3a9f8b7647fb67c81b0b55daa	Possible yes. Likely no.  Based on those dates, you would be in your fertile period but the 36 hr. pill would make implantation highly unlikely. Relax or your period will be late and you will freak out. I'd say you have less than a 2% chance of being pregnant.|`|b8b06f4ecb41e0dcbbef0bdfac455625aa	Yes, it is very possible you may be pregnant but to be sure take a pregnancy test 5 days before your period|`|ncpl2ruzaa	usually the morning after pill is very affective, i mean it can be possible that you can still b pregnant but not likely just wait to see if your late then get a test thats all you can do.|`|1af75qiDaa	You are probably not pregnant. My goodness what is the matter with you people. Don't you watch tv or read the newspaper. People are dieing of Aids...getting pregnant..babies are being killed via abortion. Stop having sex or use protection.|`|AA11898140	I don't think you have anything to worry about. You took the baby killer pill I'm sure you have all angles covered there. Try and think smarter next time. Children dont deserve to be unwanted|`|Jv3wdxliaa	relax, you most likely aren't pregnant<br>  <br>  if you are really that worried wait a few more days and take a test to put your mind at ease<br>  <br>  <br>  best of luck to you!<br>  <br>  <br>  be more careful next time|`|K6RyeHr6aa	It is not possible for you to be pregnant, as sperm can not survive outside of the body.|`|KdmNI3ymaa	It is possible if you were ovulating at the time, although very unlikely.  You ovulate 14 days before you get your period, so when you get your period next, count 14 days back and see if the dates match up.  Good idea that you took Plan B though.|`|Q4xoT1O3aa	why do stupid people have sex and risk bringing a baby into the world.. there is no chance you are pregnant the sperm would have died before he put his hand down there and you took plan B LMFAO yea... get a book and read about it are you like 12?|`|mPODUVh3aa	I am more concerned about your self-esteem & your odd need to be so graphic.  Why is it so important for others to know you are sexual?  Don't your realize that you're lacking self-respect?  You met a guy and had sex with him?  Be a woman and don't allow men to define who you are.  Stop this BS.  If I was your mother you would not have been able to have had sex because you wouldn't be at this party.  There have been signs of this before this and obviously your parents are missing them Don't you miss them.  You will be one more adult who lives their entire life with regret because of their neurotic behavior as a teen.  Its not too late for you though.  Stand up and recognize you are worth more than this.  You are treating yourself with disrespect.  Recognize it and change it before its too late. And if my daughter (or son) was acting like this, I do not apologize, if I couldn't reason with them I would beat their *** and they wouldn't see the blue sky for some time.|`|p2HVltTBaa	Well if u took the morning after pill and your not sure what he had on his fingers and if he actually put his fingers inside u then its really unlikely that your pregnant u could always get a test because theres no harm in just seeing. xx|`|lajzOZlvaa	There is almost a 0% chance you are pregnant.
4a9d4f7a5e717f9f7342a7a33535fc01aa	You have to go through puberty yes, but I didn't have a period for 2 months after my miscarriage, and still got pregnant. So if you skip a period you can still get pregnant.|`|4b525082fc2145b874266ed2dbdf3aecaa	You can become pregnant ANYTIME during your cycle! You could ALSO become pregnant if you haven't yet started your period but you are close to be getting it! Sometimes you might not even know you got your period because there's so little of it.<br>  <br>  ALWAYS USE PROTECTION IF YOU DONT WANT TO BECOME PREGNANT.|`|mMugRyp2aa	No, so do not have sex if you do not want to get pregnant.|`|0R345HDiaa	A true period follows ovulation.  That is, the lining of your uterus has to build up and wait for an egg to be released.  If the egg isn't fertilized then you shed the lining 12 to 16 days later (following ovulation) so then you get your period.  So the answer is yes, you ovulate first, then get your period.  If you're taking chances with sex because you haven't had your period yet, then all I can suggest is to use protection or abstain.  Because you CAN get pregnant.  Goodluck!|`|AA11025982	yes you do, you have to end your period to be able to get pregnant. i have an almost 2 year old and 30 weeks pregnant.|`|mPODUVh3aa	Not typically.  But it has happened in girls as young as 9 yrs old.  Have you done something that could have made you pregnant?  Talk with your mother.  I agree. Moms are usually cool no matter what.|`|e3027264abd9969831f4acec6827525faa	Scary question!  You should talk to your mother about that!|`|sVJiFWsWaa	Yes, you do need to start a menstral cycle.....this when you have officially begin to produce eggs.
25723b56f751c95f25cc0f7a9481eae2aa	my doctor OKed me to take claritin and benadryl during pregnancy. but i still only take it when i have to...makes me nervous|`|6GA351NFaa	Most doctors recommend the old generation anti-histamines because they've been on the market for so long that their long-term effect is known better - however they're sedative so driving wouldn't be such a good idea. <br>  <br>  Some of the newer non-sedative ones have been around for more than 10 years now, one of them being Ceterizine. Studies have shown that taking Ceterizine during 1. trimester doesn't increase of congenital abnormalities. With Loratadine there might be a risk of hypospadia (a male birth defect that causes difficulty directing the urinary stream thus causing it to spray) <br>  <br>  If you only have symptoms from one organ, using local spray or eye drops would probably be better.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, the best thing would be to consult your doctor before using antihistamine.
0ef04d0c23451c3fb66d5a0c5fc2536daa	Sperm are only supposed to live for 48 hours once inside the female. But depending on the hour of intercourse (late at night) and actual ovulation (early morning) it could very well work out.|`|1f61b9040bf7c007f48a641236e5e2d6aa	Well, if you ovulated after intercourse, there is a chance.  Sperm can live up to 5 days (not common) in prime conditions.  Eggs only live 12-24 hours.  So your best bet to get pregnant is to have sex prior to ovulation, which you did.  However,  I think you may have done it a little too soon but it's possible.  The ideal time line is sex the day before or of ovulation.<br>  <br>  Test.|`|Iks1qdElaa	Could possibly happen, only way to know is to take a store bought pg test and mind you they are not always accurate.

So, at this point all you can do is wait until your period is late and take a test.  Good luck!|`|I1hc0zAzaa	Most of the books I have say that sperm can live for three days after intercourse (approximately). So it is definitely possible. If you are trying to get pregnant, you will want to have intercourse before ovulation for your best chance. I would take a pregnancy test 14-18 days after you ovulated, just to check.

Sicuramente l'essenziale per lui ora sei tu e ovviamente lui deve partecipare concretamente con te alla sua vita. Alla crescita di tutti e tre invece devono contribuire entrambi i vostri genitori. Da soli nn ce la potete fare avete bisogno dell'appoggio delle vostre famiglie. Cmq avete scelto di far nascere questa creatura e, anche se siete molto giovani, nn trovo giusto che le persone vi diano addosso dicendovi che vi siete rovinati la vita. Ci sono ragazzi che si rovinano la vita consapevolmente e in modo peggiore. In bocca al lupo!|`|PomGOjvMaa	sicuramente c'è un sacco di gente che ti vuole bene e che è disposta a tenertelo.....ma tu dopo la gravidanza continua ad andare a scuola e a fare le stesse cose che fanno le ragazze della tua età perchè, anche se nn ti ci senti, dentro sei ancora troppo bambina per affrontare ciò....|`|a2380279b6f91930b9814dcf79397d42aa	il problema è che darai ai tuoi geniotri una altra bocca da sfamare perchè voi ragazzini superificiali basta che fate sesso quando lo fanno el vostre amichette, che siano 13,14 o 15 anni addirtittura.. non vene importa delle precauzione!<br>  Vi rovinate la vita e neanche ne siete al corrente..Dio che generazione...|`|bP0nMaGDaa	certo lo avete fatto in due|`|bwrTUA7caa	...si....è più che giusto....io ho 17 anni e sono al 5 mese di gravidanza...il bambino starà a casa con me e i miei....e il mio ragazzo lavorerà....per ora io sto a casa mia e lui a casa sua....finisco la scuola e poi potrò pensare di andare a vivere con lui...ma ne passeranno almeno 3 di anni......quindi, lui verrà da me finito di lavorare e venerdì, sabato e domenica andrò a casa di lui...così anche l'altra nonna si gode un po' il suo nipotino...no??.....<br>  ...cmq il tuo fidanzato ha il dovere di occuparsene....e magari mentre tu provi a finire la scuola superiore, lui può lavorare e mantenere  il suo o la sua piccola......cmq alla fine lo dirai ai tuoi??|`|dbltwaGpaa	guarda che non è un problema!!!!!e comunque dovreste occuparvene entrambi!!!!!|`|e2DtbQpLaa	tra il dire e il fare c'è di mezzo il mare....|`|mWZ2J4b6aa	Oh dio io non sono nessuno e non voglio criticarti,però è strano come ci possano essere situazioni così diverse,io ho la tua età e non ho neanke 1ragazzo..comunque ti auguro tutta la fortuna di questo mondo.|`|pkXCQs0Kaa	Certo che se ne deve occupare, ma l'essenziale per il bambino sei tu, non lui|`|xnOzIYwxaa	Com'è che ti fai in 4 per gli amici per risolvere i problemi con la playstation e poi tutto d'un botto si parla di gravidanza?

State ancora insieme? Lui ha rifiutato di occuparsene?<br>  Da come è formulata la domanda mi sembra di capire che non c'è più feeling fra te e il tuo ragazzo: "ki terrà il bambino" sembra esculdere in partenza che lo potreste tenere insieme.<br>  Non voglio dirti che cosa fare perche credo che forse non c'è niente di peggio del non avere una mamma o un papà che averne una/uno che non ti vuole.<br>  Vuoi tenere con te il tuo bambino? Allora tienilo.<br>  Se non lo vuoi è il caso di pensare ad altre soluzioni (e non parlo di aborto).<br>  Il tuo fidanzato che ne pensa?<br>  Se fai una domanda del genere sembrerebbe che lui non abbia intenzione di occuparsene. Se è così lascia perdere.<br>  Ma tieni sempre in considerazione che se lui è piccolo quanto te è normale che non se la senta di prendere una simile decisione, magari fra un po' se ne pente, magari no (e in questo caso non hai perso niente di buono). Ed è vero che anche per te non è certo una passeggiata, anzi è anche peggio. Ma senza fare femminismo o maschilismo è un dato di fatto che le donne tendano a maturare prima degli uomini, che siano portate più ad accettare una cosa del genere, anche perché il bambino cresce dentro di te, non di lui.<br>  <br>  Se nella tua domanda invece volevi sapere se è giusto dirlielo o no, beh io personalmente in questo sono categorica. Trovo assolutamente egoiste quelle donne che dicono il bambino è mio, lo porto dentro io o cose di questo genere. Un bambino non è un quadro, una casa al mare o una macchina che si può litigare col partner. Si fa in due e ha bisogno di due persone se ciò è possibile.<br>  Il fatto che sia una donna ad accollarsene il peso forse maggiore, può darci dei privilegi forse, ma non l'esclusività.<br>  Sono convinta che per quanto str*** sia stato con una donna il padre di suo figlio lei non debba usare questo odio per vendicarsi e privare suo figlio del padre, e viceversa.<br>  <br>  Questo è ciò che penso io naturalmente.<br>  Comunque molti di quelli che hanno risposto hanno ragione: i tuoi genitori dovrebbero aiutarti, e forse anche i genitori di lui (dipende da che tipo di genitori avete).<br>  Un consiglio che ti dò come darei ad una sorella in questa situazione: non sposarti per il bambino!! Già così la tua vita sarà molto più complicata di quanto è giusto per la tua età, ma un matrimonio per un motivo del genere, alla tua età, quello sì potrebbe rovinarti la vita.<br>  Se siete ancora innamorati andate a vivere insieme, ma aspettate a sposarvi di essere più grandi e sicuri!|`|GI2Lz6pRaa	senti bella smetila di prenderci tt in giro..........leggete il profilo della signorina o signorino..........ha gia fatto questa domanda dove diceva di essre incinta e avere 16 anni............e poi vedrete ...........correte a controllare.|`|JuZatc7Xaa	anche se sono contrario agli aborti ti consiglio comunque di non continuare la gravidanza... è un peso troppo difficile da portarsi dietro eppoi siete ancora ragazzi mica potete stare a vita insieme...|`|P2rwWEN1aa	Mi immedesimo nella tua situazione anch'io sono una fidanzata di 15 anni (ma ancora vergine). E' giustissimo che se ne occupi anche lui xkè il bambino l'avete fatto in due, no? Parlane soppratutto con i tuoi genitori e con i tuoi suoceri e prendete tutti un accordo. Ma apposta di rovinarsi la vita a qesta età non è meglio che aborti? Un bambino per crescere bene ha bisogno di amore e voi non potete darne abbastanza se non lo desiderate al 100%. Ti auguro davvero buona fortuna!|`|UaFJaAy2aa	è una cosa orribile quello che sto scrivendo ma è meglio che tu lo perda....ma ragazze usate la testa.....è orribile a 15 anni che sei ancora tu cosi giovane...non ho parole|`|VURlpZ1caa	Io penso che sia uno scherzo e che tu non abbia niente da chiedere per adesso e quindi ti sei inventato tutto.

And if not, keep trying, that's the fun part.|`|cFqSMmK3aa	It's unlikely you were ovulating yet, but keep having sex daily! Good luck! :)|`|q8I5CZFeaa	It is going to depend on how long your cycle is every month.  Do you always get your period after a certain amount of days or is it sometimes different?  I have a 30-31 day cycle and I got my AF on August 28th.  I will start my ovulation today and end it on the 14 or 15 so we will be baby dancin today and every other day for the next week.  You can never be actually certain of your ovulation.  If it helps you can try using a basal body thermometer and record your temps every day and also buy a ovulation predictor kit.  Start keeping track of your AF so you can count your cycle days.  Also you can check your CM and when it is egg-white and stretchy you are ovulating.  Hope this helps.  Also look up ovulation calendars on the web there are lots of free ones and you can figure out your ovulation days that way also.  Good luck to you!!!  :)

If you are pregnant, a test would show positive at this point. Those symptoms can be signs of stress as well, but if you have a regular period and have never been late like this, take a test or see your gyno. If you are, congratulations.

zoAqdu1Jaa	I think your hormones are in full gear hun. Having 3 children 4 years and younger must be taking a toll on you physically. Not being able to rest when you need to has to be extremely hard. I know what you are going through. I have 3 children as well, and I am pregnant. My morning sickness hasn't kicked in to full gear yet, and I am not looking forward to it.<br>  <br>   I am assuming you have gained that much weight because you are eating more? There is not much you can do with the headaches, but it is safe to take regular strength tylenol.  I think maybe a cold cloth applied to your neck or forehead may help with the headaches. Or try sitting out side for some fresh air, while taking very deep breaths. <br>  <br>   Do you have anyone that can come and help out a bit? Maybe take the kids a couple days a week, so you can get the rest you need? <br>  <br>   My other suggestion, which people might not agree with, is whatever you are craving...eat. Don't force things in you that might make you more nauseous. That is the only thing that helped me get through my last pregnancy with my son. I had MS until I was almost 18 weeks. It was enough to make me feel crazy. <br>   <br>  wear a tighter bra to keep your boobs from bouncing around too much.. I also had cramping up until 10 or so weeks. Our bodies know what they are doing  because they have done it before. <br>  <br>   <br>   I wish you the best and completely understand where you are coming from. Take care|`|532XA7lkaa	7 weeks is so early...have you had your first appointment yet?  They did a trans-vaginal ultrasound my first appointment to check on the baby and they can see at that point whether or not it is twins.  I saw the doctor the first time at 10 weeks, she has patients wait until that point before being seen.  There was only one for me, I am now almost 16 weeks along.  I have gained a lot of weight already too, I don't even want to say how much and I started out healthy and thin.  I feel like I am doing the best I can with watching what and how much of things I eat...my doc says sometimes you just gain a lot...your body does what it needs to do.  Twins must really run in your family!  You'll know right away at that first appointment!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Every pregnancy is different hun!<br>  Hang in there.|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	I gained 10 pounds in my first month of pregnancy and had every symptom in the book! Sore, achey boobs that were humongous, headaches everyday that I never used to get before, nausea, cramping, backaches...and I'm only 14 weeks now. Adjusting to accept a baby makes the body go through ALOT of changes and there are so many side effects and it sounds like yours all all perfectly normal. You uterus is growing and changing to house the baby, so even light cramping is normal.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!
tkSXjqhuaa	Eek! Yes. <br>  <br>  My son is 5 months old, but he was born 2 months early, so its expected that he wont be "up to date", if you know what I mean. The other night we went to dinner, and my mom tried feeding him mashed potatoes with garlic and salt! I havent started him on solids yet, theres no need for it. I asked her to please not feed him that, because he's got a very sensitive diet, and she said alright. I went to the bathroom, and came back, and she was feeding him potatoes! I was so angry! And of course he had a stomach ache after wards.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Oh yeah all the time!! My MIL babysat Rylie on Wed eve for 3 hours whilst I want to the football, so I made her a packed lunch.

Apparently she didnt give her kids pasta etc when they were 14months incase they choked, so Rylie wasnt allowed them!!!<br>  <br>  In Rylie's 1st birthday party my auntie was trying to give her pink 'n' whites! (the marshmallow things with wafered, you know covered in sugar,lol) and my sister overheard her saying 'quick eat this before Mammy sees, she'll kill me' I went over took it straight off her! <br>  <br>  I know that might seem like I overreacted, but my auntie knew Rylie wasnt allowed it and still tried to give it to her behind my back!

So he said ok and they left to walk into town next thing i know i look out the window and my dad is getting an ice cream.

So i dont rock him to sleep anymore i calm him and give him a bottle and then lay him down so he drifts off himself<br>  So I put him down for a nap and he started crying a few minutes later and she said just leave him and i said um no he is crying and went in.... So i went in and calmed him and he went off to sleep.<br>  <br>  She told me that she used to just let us cry until we gave up and i told her how i dont agree with CIO at all and that i wont practice that...<br>  <br>  Anyway i was pretty sure he was fully asleep so i went for a  10 minute drive up the road to grab a magazine ...<br>  <br>  When i got back he was screaming his lungs out.... I ran in and got him up and he was absolutely uncontrollably crying and took me 10 minutes to calm him and a bottle to settle him...<br>  <br>  I told her what the hell was she doing and she just said that he would have gone back to sleep eventually... <br>  <br>  For god sake i wont do that again...<br>  <br>  <br>  Argghhh and my mother in law DRIVES ME INSANE....<br>  <br>  Yesterday she had Jordan so i could do my Groceries....<br>  <br>  I left him a bottle and a tub of yogurt....

I was feeding her her formula and my mom remarked you should warm it up you know. I said why she has no problem with it cold or at room temp and I said it was easier that way I never have to look for a microwave or a bottle warmer just so she can eat. My mom looked at me and said give me my granddaughter and then warmed up her bottle<br>  <br>  The funny thing was though she drank maybe a couple of sucks of it and then spit it all back up...to which my mother replied "Oh, my poor Granddaughter look at what she is doing to you" It made me laugh that the whole 3 weeks I was out there she kept on trying to force the warm formula on her and everytime she did she always puked it back up<br>  <br>  Lucky for me she didn't like it and is still happily content with her cold formula|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Mr Berry was giving the baby a bottle of water the other day - he's learning to use a sippy cup so I was annoyed - its bad enough that he only drinks it from his bath at present without Daddy confusing the issue further!

He was joking but he knows I HATE anyone swearing in front of him - he thinks its funny and does it to my sister's kids, they are 8 & 5 and know its wrong but when she wants to play up my 5yr old neice will swear.<br>  <br>  I had to laugh the other day because my sister told me off for saying fanny in front of them & then proceeded to say d**k s**t and a**e all day long! Weirdo!!|`|edzU8VJiaa	When I had my first baby we had to live with my in-laws and my mother-in-law constantly offered unwanted advice.  One example; she suggested when my son was teething that I should give him some sugar, tied into a small piece of muslin, and dampened with water.  Can you imagine!!!?  I used to simply ignore all her advice and do what I felt was best, because she just wasn't the kind of person you could argue with.<br>  <br>  Don't get yourself upset about this.  You just need to have a quiet chat with your mother and tell her that you have your own way of dealing with your daughter and you would appreciate it if your mother backed you up with this, even if it differs from what she did.  (To hear that a child started school with a dummy sounds a bit odd, to say the least).  <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with letting your daughter have the occasional bottle (at bedtime, say) but I don't think you are rushing her by encouraging her to drink from a cup at 18 months.  You don't want your daughter to be stared at because she is still trailing a dummy or a bottle around with her at four or five years old, do you?<br>  <br>  Nip this interference in the bud now.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My parents are retired and they watch my kids a couple of days a week so we can save on daycare costs. They were letting my son drink out of bottles and use a pacifier until he was 2 years old!

Finally I just went over there and took all the bottles/plugs away lol.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	That's hard when it comes to Moms. I told my mom no pacifier and she put one in. <br>  <br>  I would love to say, "don't let her see her anymore until she smartens up", but for all of us moms who are close to our parents, all we can really do is discuss and communicate, which may have results, and may not.<br>  <br>  Try to show your mom the sippy cup that says 18 months. Give her research etc.|`|YiDhb60Paa	You have a right to be angry!<br>  Your trying to Break your daughter of a bottle and turns behind your back and gives her a bottle..<br>  <br>  If this happend to ofcourse I would be upset, and I would pull my mother aside and ask her why did she do that and explain that I am trying to break her of having a bottle.|`|siDcjgJCaa	Yep... my mom and MIL do that stuff all the time...

"<br>  <br>  <br>  Ambers mommy: I did the same thing with my daughter.. we never gave her warm formula.. and my mother and really every woman in my family did nothing but criticize me about it!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Mothers eh!<br>  <br>  My mum is always always putting extra clothing on my daughter, I constantly tell her that over heating is as bad as under and that when she is too hot she gets a rash! But nope, grandma knows best...I am very glad she is concerned though.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I wouldn't make a HUGE deal about it but if you want to talk to your mom about it, just try and tell her gently that you know what's best for your daughter and please don't interfere like that again.|`|7cf4b3bd36e805b27e9c6125e10e129aaa	Gosh!!!<br>  I think you're all sooooooo lucky to have mums that are there for you - even to interfere.  I would have given anything to have my mum alive to interfere when my babies were born.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Yeah that is bad, but just forget it.  Not worth arguing over.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	um okay, and the big deal is?????|`|35irl04Paa	Yes! I have the same problem. I am on my husbands thing so this is actually a girl. lol. But anyways. My husband and I have been fighting about the whole change thing. I am trying to get my son on a regular cup. He does not take a bottle at all. The thing that my husband underminds me about is that when it is bed time he wants our son to sleep in the bed with us. I keep telling him that I don't want a child in our bed because they will want to stay there. Now everytime we put him in his bed he falls asleep and a few hours later he is in our bed again. The cup thing I am kind of getting my own way now. My husband thinks that he is too young for a cup bc he is 20 months. I am 34 weeks pregnant and I don't want our kids to have buck teeth from sucking on something. Now it has become that I have to treat my husband like a child and it is working. I make him use the sippie cup when he is not at work. IE like when we are eating dinner or something. It makes him feel like he is a kid again and he is getting to the point that whatever I SAY GOES! lol. Its working great. If you dont want her to have a bottle, just dont give them to her. Hide them somewhere that nobody else can find them. I just completely stopped my son on a bottle. No more bottles in the house only in the attic or garage. hope this helps. KIND OF LONG! SORRY|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	Ohhh yes, I'd be frustrated too! Luckily, I haven't had problems with my parents at all, but my in laws are a different story. After my son was born we were quite determined to breastfeed exclusively even though I was having a rough start with it. When my son was 4 weeks old, and my in laws came over one night (after an overly emotional day of painful feedings), my MIL took me aside and demanded that I give him formula because he was 'too tiny' (but ya know he's always been and still is a lean boy). Anywho, I was mad, and went in the other room to compose myself. I came back and she had already gone through my pantry to find the formula (that she had given me as a shower gift) and was shaking up a bottle. If I hadn't come back in time I swear she would've given it to him. Blah blah.... she ended up apologizing severely after my hubby had a talk with her. She still makes comments about his weight though... and the boy eats more than I do. In fact, when my SIL found out I was pregnant again, one of the first things she said to me was "I just hope this baby is bigger when he/she is born" ...like my son was unhealthy. 6lbs 14oz isn't a huge baby, but they make it sound like he was abnormal. Ugh.... in laws. <br>  Did you let your mom know you were upset about the situation? Did she get it, at all?|`|BX4Ja1Rgaa	Yeah its happened to me on numerous occassions but that the folks for you its no use to get angry about it they mean well I can say this because i am now the grandparent and i do the same with my g-kids and my kids they do get angry but all they do is to let me know that they want to raise their kids their way and what can i do but just try to do as they wish but as for my mom no matter what i said she still did put her two cents in so what i did was to let my kids know is that what i said is what was done no ands ifs about it.|`|I4a8zI1gaa	I feel for you - it happens all the time with my mom.  I'm a great mother to my 10 month old, but since his birth - she questions everything i do.  Like the kid was up allll day.  He didn't want to take a nap, but I knew he needed to.  I kept trying to get him to go down.. and she's like.. he doesn't want to sleep!!  what are u doing?  and so she kept him up playing and keeping him going until it was bedtime - in which he protested because he was beyond overtired.<br>  <br>  And I have lullabies on and a sound machine in his room.  I've tried having nothing, i've tried one or the other, but he needs the music on and fairly loud, with teh white noise as well.  so she's constantly telling me.. "u have that music too loud in there" , "I would just turn that off, no wonder he cant sleep and hes waking up".. <br>  <br>  When he was a newborn , i'd rub his back gently to get him to burp, and shes like why are u doing that? how would u like it if someone does that to you rback? (and she proceeded to do it to my back).. i was like wtf are u doing!?  its the only way i can get him to burp...<br>  <br>  ahh.. and the list goes on.  So i think this is one of those things where our parents feel like experts over us... they have to put in their two cents to make us feel inadequate and them superior.  I don't agree with it, but i've learned to take what she says with a grain of salt.  I"m the mom, and what i say is the way it's going to be regardless.  :)|`|YVpWpg6Saa	My husband did once.  It was about watering down my daughters juice (she was 18 months at the time).  We had agreed that we would water down her juice for as long as possible.  Then one day while his mom was visitng, he decided to just give her straight apple juice.  I stepped in and said no, that's not what we agreed on, she gets watered down apple juice.  Of course his mom, who isn't my biggest fan to begin with, pipes up and says that he should be able to give his daughter a treat whenever he wants without my permission.  And then goes ont o say she doesn't udnerstand why I make the rules and why I always tell him what to do with regards to our daughter.  I talked to my husband about it afterwards.  And we agreed that I am the primary caregiver, so I have a better handle on what works and what doesn't.  That is why I will put my 2 cents in when it comes to rule changes. <br>  I do not agree with the first respons, this is definately worth bringing up to your mom about.  This is YOUR daughter, and you have your way of doing things, whether she agrees with them or not.  Your mom needs to understand that she is the Grandma and you are the MOM.  <br>  First off, she should NEVER have juice from a bottle, no matter the age.  If she doesn't liek that sippy cup, try another one.  My daughter was very specific about the cups she would use.<br>  And who's to say it will stop there, your mom needs to understand that the rules are there for a reason.  Occasional spoiling from the grandparents is totally expected, but not when it undermines the parents.|`|uQK6pICraa	Very very annoying indeed.  Now if your daughter was drinking from the bottle and you weren't trying to get her to progress a little, you would have people saying 'ooh, she's still drinking from a bottle you know!'....everyone else knows best.  In actual fact, only you know best so just ignore them and ask your Mum not to give her juice again from the bottle as you know her best and therefore you make the decisions!  You don't have to argue - trust me, I've had conversations like this too many times, just be firm!<br>  Just this week my parents looked after my daughter for the day and called me to ask who dressed her....when I told them I did they said she looked like a gypsy (nice!) and sent her home in another outfit - and TRUST ME the outfit she was in was hideous!<br>  Good luck!
MavosJHYaa	Try a jumperoo or exersaucer that has lots of buttons to push and things to pull on. We got the rainforest jumperoo for our baby. It has lights, music, and animal noises when she moves so it encourages her to move more. Great for building leg muscles to get ready for standing up and walking. It has a cute little elephant that faces away from baby and they can grab it and turn it around and play peek-a-boo. Also has a tiger that when you push a button it pops up. Same peek-a-boo thing, as well as wheels and rattling things she can spin.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Something like the leap frog music table can be used as a floor toy, then when your child is older you can attach the legs and make them stand to use it. It has a piano and plays lots of music and songs, english and spanish.  And it has lights on it.
uVTkjQoqaa	Well i am an overly organized freak (as my husband says haha) so my bags were already packed! I went into labor at 37 weeks so that helped!!<br>  <br>  I was WALKING all the time because i was wantin to get that baby out! I coudn't wait any longer! I had already finished his nursery (again, only because i'm overly organized and i plan everything) but most likely, your baby will sleep in a basinett for 3-6 months in your room so you'll have time then as well! <br>  <br>  When they are first born, they sleep all the time anyways! I painted the whole downstairs of my house while my son was napping all the time as a new born.<br>  <br>  As of now- i think you're fine. Just make sure you've got several clothing necessities (onesies, socks, mittens, etc) and blankets (you'll use receiving blankets for everything!) and bottles, breast pump (If applicable), baby laundry detergent, monitor, etc. If you go online- they'll give you checklists of what you should have for your new baby...i LOVED THOSE!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck! You'll be fine- i'm sure!|`|46PSDx1raa	I'm also 36 weeks, I'll be 37 weeks tomorrow and I stopped working at 34 weeks due to being put on bed rest. I've finished the nursery recently and I packed the bags for the hospital the other day. Right now I'm doing a lot of walking around the neighborhood and cleaning around the house to fill my time. Also I'm reading more than I did while I was working and trying to get as much sleep as possible. You should have your birthing plan written up shortly in case you go into early labor. Good luck :)|`|eGfAXaV3aa	Same boat hun! I'm 37 weeks and 2 cms dilated....still working full time...still getting baby's room together...in the process of moving my bedroom closer to baby's room. But please do get that bag packed asap....I mean like now...put some clothes in for the baby in there too ...toothbrush...toothpaste....extra undies...and pads (I haven't given birth yet...but one thing I've heard is that you want to bring your own pads...b/c the hospital gives out the maxi pads..or I'd like to call them bricks...you don't want that). Don't freak out...do write a birthing plan...do pack your bag....do get the car seat together...and do have a place prepared for baby to sleep if your little one decides to come early....we got a pack and play that comes with a bassinet and a changing table attached...that's really all baby needs the first few weeks anyway (well and diapers....stuff like that)...Happy for you!!! :)|`|NGAZSqn2aa	I was so sick of being pregnant at 36 weeks! I didnt do anything... I was out on maternity leave. I was so lazy and I waited till the last minute to pack my bag.. although her nursery, her bag, and everything else was ready. I went through a nesting period earlier... maybe around 30 weeks and then towards the end of my pregnancy I just wanted to lay around. Its OK if your nursey isnt done.. as long as your baby has somewhere to sleep you should be fine! And it shouldnt take you more then 20 minutes to pack a bag for yourself.. you'll be fine!|`|WsEFCpemaa	You probably should have all of these things done by now.<br>  I am 37 weeks today and baby's room has been done for about 2 months, baby's bag is packed, birth plan is done, and I am also still working 40+ hours a week.|`|9E91O09caa	I'm 37 weeks pregnant. I made my list and packed my bag a couple of weeks ago because you never know what can happen. Haven't wrote out a will or anything even though I've read it's a good thing to do. I'm still working and doing things around the house and such.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	i was working 45 hour weeks & trying to finish the mural in my baby's room. i hadn't packed yet.... i never had a strict birthing plan, and nothing even went as i'd vaguely planned anyhow.<br>  <br>  if i were you, i'd just relax. it is SO hard to go thru labor on top of already being exhausted! pack a bag, but don't stress about it. hospitals provide everything you need while your there.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I'm 35 weeks, still working full time, still working on the nursery.. I started packing my suitcase and the baby bag for the hospital, and started buying things here and there to stock up my pantry. In the next few weeks I am going to hire someone to come clean my house top to bottom, even though it stays pretty clean. I think you are where you are supposed to be as far as getting things accomplished. It's harder when you work full time and then on the weekends all you want to do is rest.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I am 37 weeks today.  I just did baby's laundry last weekend but I still have to pack hospital bag which I most likely will do tomorrow.  I still need to assemble crib in my room. I am done shopping for almost everything from cloths to baby lotion, wash, bottle etc.  I am stay home mom and I am still not ready for everything since I am on bed rest due to preeclampsia.  You are working full time so I know it is hard to get everything done, when I was working full time with my first daughter I just did the important things which are necessary.|`|MXXOICquaa	if i were you i would just make sure everything was ready for him to come home and not worry about everything like for example when gertting his room ready is you know there is something he isnt going to use as soon as he gets home dont worry with just the important stuff and go on and pack your bag although i probably wont pack mine until its go time i love to procratinate lol good luck|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	You should pack your bag girl. If you plan on having a babyshower, don't wait much longer either and the nursery, just put on a coat of paint, some borders, a rocking chair and the crib and you're good to go! Don't stress! enjoy! if you think you don't have time now, wait till your prince gets here! Congrats!|`|21LiTNVsaa	yea i packed my bag at 34 weeks, the babys room was done by the time i was like 6 months pregnant, but i dont work or anything so i had a lot of time to prepare, 38 weeks now and just waiting on him to arrive!
siDcjgJCaa	Wellllll... I pack everything she needs for the day in her diaper bag the night before.. then in the morning.. we get up .. she goes in her exersaucer that sits just outside the bathroom... so i can shower and get ready and still see her and know she isnt going anywhere. I sometimes have to play peek-a-boo with her from the shower to keep her happy but it works.. I generally take her to my moms in her PJ's but if need be I will change her clothes just before we leave..|`|5ZdB5K6Raa	Its actually not that hard, its best to get up before the baby does and get your shower and get ready if possible, but like most babies they love to get up at 4 in the morning so what i would do with my little one is feed her got her ready, then i would put her in her bouncer to play why i got ready, and when she got a little bit older i would put her on the bed with her favorite stuffed animal and turned on the tv that kept her quit for a little while, while i got ready! But to make everything easy get your clothes and the babies clothes together the night and other things like bottles and have the diaper bag ready if your going to take your child to daycare or a friends|`|6x901MTeaa	No you are most definitely not alone! Try to set a routing... =)<br>  <br>  5-530AM: Wake up, make her a bottle. She drinks her bottle while I dress her up for daycare.<br>  530AM-615AM: I get dressed for work, she is usually bright awake and playing with her toys.<br>  615-645AM: Drop off at daycare.<br>  5:45-615PM: Pick up from daycare.<br>  615-7PM: Dinner at home and play time with mommy.<br>  7-730PM: Bath time and getting jammies on.<br>  730-830PM: Bedtime (putting baby to sleep).<br>  <br>  ALSO - Lately I've been dropping my daughter off at daycare in my jammies and THEN returning home to get ready for work. It works either way for me...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XQIbx7Plaa	My daughter is 10 months old, and I am a single Mom... I always make sure her door is shut when I first wake up first thing in the morning. That way the noise that I make will not disturb her.  <br>  I then proceed to get myself ready and prepared for the day, once I am done and all I have left is to get her dressed and ready for daycare.  I then go in and wake her.  Because I know that once she is awake there will be no 'Me' time.<br>  I always bathe her at night and I also take showers after I know she is sleeping at night, that way my mornings are a lot less stressful.<br>  I find that this works fabulously for me.<br>  I hope that this helps out!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I shower, prepare the diaper bag for daycare, and put the kids clothes out at night. I try to get up before the kids in the morning, but that doesn't work all of the time lol. I really just brush my teeth and get dressed before leaving the house. My husband's good about getting the kids up, diapers changed, and dressed for daycare. I do my make-up at my desk as soon as I get to work.|`|r1KS5GsDaa	i work 4 days a week..sat, sun, mon, and tues. the weekend i work at 7 and my daughter is asleep and doesnt have to go to the babysitter so i dont have to worry about getting her ready. i do that the night before. but on the weekdays i work at 10. ill wake up at 730 or 8 and take a shower get ready and then she wakes up. shell eat breakfast have a bath and ill get dressed. it took awhile to get the routine down but now that we do its perfect.<br>  itll get easier as your baby gets older.|`|12Q0R2HJaa	I put my son on one of those mats that he lays on and the toys are above his head. I put that on the bed while I'm in the bedroom getting ready. He lays there and plays with the toys and babbles to me. Then I put him in his swing while I get his diaper bag and my stuff ready.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	When I was working I would just wake up earlier than the baby to get ready.  Like around 5.  It worked, but it totally sucked.|`|IjcdwJiMaa	no ur not alone!! what ive found easiest 4 me was to let him sleep when i get ready 4 work (I get ready @ 6am 2 work @ 7) but if he does wake up then i put a movie on 4 him (hes 3yrs), that would be different 4 u cz hes still a baby, but if u have a swing or a bounce chair that he likes try put him in 1 of those, also it helps me if i place out what im going 2 need each morning, the night b4, i pick out all my clothes, & have my make up ready 2 be used on the counter, that way it saves me time in the morning when im still trying to keep my eyes open lol, i hope this helps u xx|`|WirFwirLaa	I take a shower and have everything laid out and ready to go the night before. My son sleeps (usually) til i'm ready to go so I just go in, get him up, change his diaper, throw on his coat and out the door we go. He goes to a in home sitter who gets him dressed after breakfast.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, after awhile it becomes routine!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I forgot to mention we have to be out the door by 7:15!|`|zPYyGw8oaa	at that age, I would get the baby all ready and get as much done while he was eating his bottle (he would hold it or I would prop it). When he was done I put him on his tummy time mat or in his exersaucer in the bathroom with me so he could see me. usually this worked but when it didnt (sometimes) I would just have to let him fuss as long as I knew nothing was wrong.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well im a single parent and start work at 9 sooo i get up at 6. i shower and eat by that time its 7 and my daughter is normally awake...i feed her and dress her....while shes prancing about with toothbrush and washcloth i get ready. by this time its around 8 15 and sooo we play for 15 mins normally wheres emmas socks after shes pulled them off and i struggle to find them lol then|`|dDVAUA9saa	I get up at 6am and shower, get dressed and dry my hair.  Then I feed the cats/dog and get breakfast started.  I wake up my daughter at about 6:50am.  We eat breakfast together, then I get her dressed and ready to go.  It works out pretty well!
Kz5Fb0mPaa	I had a similar situation. I had only invited a few close people in the room with me when I had my ultrasound a couple of days ago. When the nurse went to go get my family, my brother -in -law came in! I was so shocked and embarrassed. I felt so exposed with my stomach bare. I felt like he was the rudest person on earth at the time because he had not even asked me if he could come in before. <br>  <br>  To me, your aunt sounds very rude. Much worse than my brother-in-law. My advice is for you to count up how many people you want in the room. Make your doctor and the nurses at the hospital very aware of this number. Let them know that you ONLY want these people in the room with you and NO ONE ELSE! They will be very willing to keep everyone out. Also, another option is to not let her know you're in labor and not to call her until the baby is born!<br>  <br>  I think the main solution is to be strict with the nurses in who they let in. Our hospital has signs on the door that say "no visitors". If your aunt should try and come in, hopefully the nurses will show her the way out without you even having to deal with it!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! <br>  And dont worry, I feel your pain. I think I'm going to be having the same situation happening to me when I go into labor and this is the solution that I am going to use! Good luck and congrats!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Tell the nurse who you are allowing in. And they won't let anyone else in. Make sure they know to have her removed from the room if she tries to stay.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	you can tell the receptionist doctor and nurses at the hospital that you dont want her there|`|WPI0Z47saa	Where did you go that you were allowed to have so many people? I was only allowed to have 2 in with me.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	Tell the hospital staff! They won't let anyone in but your mom and husband.|`|9P26sacKaa	Wow.  She really is rude and obsessive.<br>  <br>  There is an easy solution, however.  You tell your doctor or midwife about the situation and tell them that this woman is not allowed to be in the hospital with you.  Also tell the nurses at the L&D at the hospital that this woman is not allowed to see you.  Give a small list of people who are allowed to come to your birth and specifically state that she (give her name and a physical description) is not allowed.  They will keep her out and you won't have to make a scene with your family.<br>  <br>  You could just tell her not to come, straight out, and if she acts like she's going to come, you could get a restraining order, but that is probably a bit excessive.  I'd just tell the nurses and doctor who is and is not allowed to come to your birth and let them handle it.  Explain the situation from your last birth and they will take care of it without making you look bad for being excessive or anything.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Tell the nurse while you are in labor what is going on. Tell your Aunt that you only want your husband and your mother in the room with you. Tell her that she is invited to see you after you deliver and are in a room and that is it. If she tries to come in while you are delivering tell the nurse to get her out and they will.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	is it home delivery?? I mean if its in the hospital then ofcourse u can ask the nurse to not let anybody come in except ur mom and hubby. but if it  is at home all u can do is, lock the room from inside and then not open until u r done or tell her not to come because u want it to be personal.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	Honestly, just tell you nurses who you want in there and who you don't. The nurses normally don't mind playing the bad guy. My mom and mother-in-law want to be in the room, but I only want my husband in there so I plan on having the nurses take care of it!|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	Why don't you talk to the hospital staff?  I know the hospital I work in you have to sign in to get to the labor rooms.  Talk to the staff and have a list that only those people on it can come in.<br>  <br>  I am sure that would work.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|64OsCr8laa	talk to your doctor tell them how you want it and that your aunt intents to mess that up! they should be able to make sure no one enters if you have to ask someone to stand by the door maing sure sh edont come it <br>  <br>  but talk to your doctors|`|vx4xwsa3aa	let your nurses know who you do not want in the room and they will tell that person that they are not allowed in anymore, in a nice way... in a way that doesnt make you sound like the bad guy|`|wLBsgNKAaa	Tell her to stay away or you will have security remove her.  Rude people have no business being around such a happy occasion.  This is your day so don't let anyone steal your joy.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	explain to the hospital staff...your nurses, whatever...that only your hubby and your mom are allowed in.  that way, they should kick anyone else out without you being affected.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Call her and tell her you don't want her there. <br>  <br>  Tell the nurses these are the people I want there, and have them kick everyone else out.|`|2af6a33fb3c228bba9062febc614578caa	So why dont you just have your husband attend the birth. Tell everyone else that you want a more private setting this time round.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Tell the hospital staff that you do not want anyone else but your mother and husband in the room.  They have to respect your wishes.|`|4lB9aEH5aa	Make a list of who is allowed in the delivery room and who is not allowed.  Give this information to the nurse, midwife, doctor... all the hospital folks working with you.  Ask them to deal with your aunt or anyone else you do not want in the room. Let them help and support you having the birth experience you want.  Make it a sacred time for you and your baby.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	Make a written birthing plan letting your doctor and all those assisting you at the hospital know who is and is not allowed in your room. Make sure everyone knows so they can take action. I would also address it with her beforehand letting her know that you love her, but she's not welcome until after you've delivered. That's what I'm going to have to do with my sisters-in-law since they've been in the delivery rooms for all of their family's births. Not fun, but oh well.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I'm sure your aunt's a mature lady. Just tell her straight up that you're not comfortable with her being there. If she comes into the room, let her know she is free to sit in the waiting room and someone will let her know as soon as the little tyke is born.<br>  <br>  I totally understand your frustration frankly if my aunt did that I'd be really pissed off!!!!|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	when you go into labour, be sure to notify the nurses who you are accepting to be in your room. Tell them that anyone other than the people on your list are not allowed in. The nurses will not let them in trust me. Good luck!!<br>  <br>   You can also tell her that you can only have 2 people in the room with you...Im assuming you live in the states or something? In Alberta, you are not allowed to have more than 2 people total with you.|`|VHHis05Naa	She sounds like a nightmare!  The fact that she was so disrespectful to you before, makes me think she will indeed try to bust her way in this time.  She has a lot of nerve and could cause you to have a very stressful birth.  When you are registering, you can register anonymously so Crazy Aunt won't even know you're in labor.  Have your other family members promise NOT to call her until the baby is born and make sure the doctors and nurses all know that the only two people you want in there with you are your mom and husband.  Let them deal with her so you can work at getting your baby born in the healthiest, least stressful way possible.  <br>  <br>  I cannot believe her comment about shaving when you were at your most vulnerable.  Unbelievable!  Kudos to you for not throwing something nasty at her.  Good luck!|`|O71xlcG3aa	Tell your mom and your husband not to let her in and also tell the hospital staff that no one besides them can come in during your labor.  Or just tell your aunt that she is not welcome to come in this time because you only want your mom and your husband.  She may be family but that doesn't give her the right to do whatever she wants.  If she doesn't get it then just start cursing and screaming when she walks in and I promise they will make her leave.|`|VS8mactUaa	when you got everyone in the room that you want there, tell the doctors, no more visitors, and if she comes in they will tell her to leave, and to make an emphasis on it yell in the middle of a contraction, GET OUT NOW, she'll take a hint.|`|j083iujcaa	the easiest thing to do would be not to let her know when you are going to the hospital. you can also inform the nurses that you don't want visitors and they can keep her out of the room for you if she shows up.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	omg shes nuts !! i woudl just tell her and everyone there not to have her in the room along with the staff. AS FOR HER WATCHING YOUR SON SAY NO!! PPl like that the more you give in the more they will take believe me my mother is like this freaking annoying !! In fact I dont want my mom to be in the room with me this time she acted like she was the dr AHHHHHH|`|Axcy1DYlaa	Tell the hospital not to let her in. There really shouldnt be people in and out of the room anyway while you're delivering. Explain to her that you really only want your husband and mom in the room and under no circumstances would you want anyone else. it's not a freak show. And make the nurses and dr aware of it too. they might be able to help. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
9E91O09caa	First trimester is full of that, mine was terrible. Horrible headaches and couldn't eat or keep anything down. I lost a lot of weight during this time. Hopefully your second trimester gets better or things get better for you sooner. Everyone's different. Good luck!|`|2B2fgmw9aa	It's called morning sickness which can happen at anytime throughout the day! Keep some crackers next to your bed to help settle your stomach.|`|ixHwF4apaa	when i child i had that problem. i was asked by Doctor to take lot of fibrous food and take lot of fluids. now i do not get very frequently.mine is not connected with pregnancy.|`|vtFbGgTRaa	did you actually test(BLOOD TEST would find the kid by now if you clain a regular pregnancy test wouldn't) for it or did you get too drunk to do that while wondering what your ex was doing?
u1DDrXO2aa	I did not meet mine i didn't even really put much thought in it before my son was born and the day i went home they asked if i had one and i didnt and they told me i needed to have one before i left so they gave me a few and i made a phone call and turned out when i took my son a week later that i really liked his pediatrician...but even if you dont meet them its not like you cant change at any time.|`|bc9inzicaa	I interviewed two pediatricians and finally picked one the day before my son was born.  <br>  <br>  If you have not picked on yet, it is fine. The baby will still be seen by the hospital pediatrician (i had asked about this since i was still indecisive about my son's pediatrician at the time).   <br>  <br>  When i had my son, all i had to do was give the nurse the pediatrician's name and the hospital made arrangements to inform her of my son's birth and she came to the hospital the next day to see him.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	No I picked her because my midwife suggested her because her kids see her as well. I wanted a family practice doctor vs a pediatrician because I can see her too and so can my bf and any future children she can take care of the whole family as our primary physician. I just told the doctors after I delivered who I wanted and she came to see us in the hospital and we set up her 2 and 8 weeks appts. at that point as well. I got lucky I really like her. It is not necessary to meet with them before the baby comes but you may want to call their office to make sure they are taking new patients and you can for sure get in to them. Good luck on the labor and delivery I hope it goes great for you. When you see your child for the 1st time it's amazing:-)|`|5udXQ79Laa	No I didn't meet mine before my baby was born.  And then when he was three months old, I switched peds to one my friend said was good becuase I ended up not liking the first one.|`|24f969b02a5ea25351be932405126b28aa	it is very hard to pick a pediatrician but when I had my daughter and the pediatrician came in to see her and asked what pedia I had picked out I said I didn't have one and asked if she had kids and who she took her kids to. I figured that with her being a pediatrician she did her homework when she picked hers for her kids and that is who I went with and she is the best doctor.|`|2I5D78Sbaa	it is so hard to find the right pediatrician. i met my daughters before she was born, they told me they wouldn't let me leave the hospital unless she had one because the pedi has to come in and see the baby.<br>  after that we've been threw about 5 pedi's until i found the right one.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Oh gosh. with an HMO you just get to try em out.  I am pretty pleased with her right now.  Just saw her today and felt that we got pretty good service.  You just have to try them out.  You know you're gonna do what you're gonna do and after the first few month of well baby checkups you only see them occasionally anyway.  You know regarless of what they say you have already done your research and know what is goiing on pretty much.  Peds are mostly a resource for prescriptions and such.  Today we finally went in for my daughters chronic stomach pain and she ordered like 12 or 13 tests, so I'm glad.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I didn't have to pick a paediatrician. He checked her out the day she was born and has been seeing her ever since. My daughter was born with an ovarian cyst so this could be why he was assigned to us instead of us choosing one.
mVD3TQkFaa	I agree with the 1st poster don't worry about all this stuff they go through everything with you at the hospital. A nurse brought in my paper work and went over it all with me. If you have questions all you have to do is ask. But how I did it is that I put my daughters name and info and my name and info but because I'm not married to her dad ( like you) I couldn't put his name on the birth certificate it only asks for husbands name and info. They give you voluntary paternity forms to fill out and then his name would be added to the birth certificate as long as he fills out those forms but you can put his last name as your daughters on the form. They give you the forms for his social security card and papers that state how and how much it cost to get copies fo the birth certificate because you just don't automatically get one you have to pay 20.00 and 10.00 to change anything. It all sounds complicated but they give the folder that has all the info and directions on how to fill it all out. Make sure you give this all to the nurse before you leave.|`|hPG2pedLaa	at some point they will ask you the parents names... i wondered this as well when he had our daughter. my husband and myself never saw ab.c to sign... they print them up and you will recieve it in the mail within a few wks of delivery|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	*lol* Well obviously they don't expect the baby to sign.  But every country, and often state or province has their own ways of doing it<br>  <br>  If they make a mistake they will fix it.<br>  <br>  If its really bothering you you can generally pick up the forms ahead of time, you just have to figure out which agency is in charge.  I'm Canadian so its the Office of the Registrar General.<br>  <br>  You can also drop in to a hospital and ask to see a copy of the form because not knowing is bugging you.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Girl - you are stressing too much!<br>  <br>  You sign the baby's name.  Then you indicate your full name and the father's full name.  If you have any questions at all, the hospital staff will be able to help.  Do you know how many birth certificates they fill out on a daily basis?  They're very knowledgeable with the subject.
R8bXuLbTaa	ghahaha WOW. You are skinny. I was worried but I had reason you do not<br>  <br>  I weight 105 when I got pregnant and delivered at 200. I guess Im just a fat cow. <br>  <br>  I lost it all in 6 months so no no biggy. No stretch marks either!|`|4iXL4C6paa	I gained over 50 pounds with my last child, with the other three before him I probably gained around 20 so he is 5 1/2 months now and I still don't have it off and it just drives me crazy because after I had my other children the weight came right off so I understand exactly how you feel|`|WgIZUcYfaa	Yeah it does bother me. Its the only time in my life when I am supposed to gain weight even though I don't want to. And I can't do anything about it either cause its not good for the baby. I also feel like a whale. A big old beluga whale!<br>  <br>  I know. Call the waaaahhmbulance.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I keep loosing weight so I don't know what it's like yet to see it go up. I have my next appointment on Tuesday and I'm hoping I at least stayed the same or gained a couple this time. For me being pregnant has been the best "diet" I've ever been on! I keep trying to gain and I keep loosing! I wish it was this way when I wasn't pregnant!

I am due July 11 with my second. My first child is a 16 year old girl. I so excited and can't believe I'm doing it all over again. I am showing but it looks more fat then a cute baby bump. I have pics but not sure how to post them. <br>  Good Luck|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	I am due August 29th and I my bump started at 6 weeks and looked just about the same as yours.

Congrats!! =]|`|dR2bqUixaa	I'm due August 11th! But no baby bump yet. I can't wait til I get one so I can show it off. Lol!|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I am due August 21st, 09 and I have somewhat of a bump - to an average person they might think I just have gained some belly fat. I have a picture when I was 8 weeks pregnant but you can't tell at all. I actually didn't tell my coworkers until 10 weeks and even then, most of them were in shock and didn't believe it. I can't wait to show more. <br>  <br>  I'm 15 weeks today!
2ZoUduoPaa	I know I've said it before, but I promise, they soon grow out of it.  Kalyn started sleeping through the night a few weeks ago (she's 12wks old).  Until then, she was just like Ryland.  She still wriggles constantly.  I HAVE to keep her swaddled at night, and TIGHTLY, or she wakes her self up continuously.  I know I'll get thumbs down for this, but we started giving the baby some cereal, sometimes for breakfast and sometimes for supper and she seems more "satisfied".  I know, I know you're not SUPPOSED to feed them anything until 4 mos old, but sometimes you just do what you have to do.  I know you've mentioned before about him constantly being on the breast, and while I support you 100% in your breastfeeding (especially since I was unable to) I wonder if any supplementing might help.  Not too much, just maybe before bed time.  I was told in the hospital, during my attempts at BFing that formula stayed with them longer, that's why you have to feed a BF baby more often.  Maybe try the supplementing (I know you said you sometimes formula feed when you're out) before bed time.  Maybe then his little tummy will be full and he will sleep for a while.  <br>  Also, try some Little Remedies Little Tummies Gripe Water.  Even now when Kalyn can't quite get settled, I give her 1/2 tsp (that ammount is okay for Ryland too) and it seems to calm her.  It supposedly all natural ingredients so it's safe to take, even if she's on another medication for something.  <br>  I do hope things get better for you.  Kalyn at one point was only sleeping approximately 6-8hrs out of a 24hr period.  Now she plays alot during the day, and sleeps most, if not all, night.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, hope things get better soon!!!|`|KmC0K59taa	Is his nose clogged up?  Maybe he has a cold.<br>  <br>  Try lying him on your skin.  Babies love skin to skin contact.  Get a sling and wear him against you.  They are used to being in your womb and it's scary to be put down in a crib alone.  I held my daughter most of the time for 8 weeks.  I didn't mind it.|`|bmWKETgWaa	Forty years ago it was considered OK to feed tiny babies rice cereal and baby applesauce or strained pears.  If the mom was nursing, she could catch the drips from the opposite side in a little cup, mix in a few flakes of rice cereal, and feed it to the baby on an infant feeding spoon.  This had the advantage of not wasting any milk. <br>  <br>  I once heard a strange story about a baby who fussed and cried constantly.  The parents tried everything they could think of.  Finally a friend noticed that the baby cried harder when his feet were moved.  She turned his sleeper inside out and found that a stray thread was catching between his toes and causing him pain. <br>  <br>  Look to see if there's anything that might be making your baby continuously uncomfortable.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Oh I feel you!!! My 5 week old daughter has been the same way, I actually made a doctor appointment because she was making a wheezy sounding noise before she woke up and I'm glad I did because her doctor said that the problem was probably that her trachea was still developing and she wasn't breathing well laying flat and that the reason she was probably so much better being held was because her head was elevated, but the great news? Totally TEMPORARY! : ) Thanks heaven. So I gave it a shot and it has definately made a difference.<br>  <br>  Here is what works for me<br>  <br>  She sleeps great in her carseat so sometimes a drive around the block will do the trick.<br>  <br>  I also put her in her car seat and bring her into the bathroom with me so that I can take a bath.<br>  <br>  Elevate his head when he's sleeping (okay attempting sleep) in his crib, bassinet or pack n' play.<br>  <br>  We bought a swing and that is the only thing that has made it possible fo me to eat. Worth every penny.<br>  <br>  And if you want to get anything done around the house you need a sleepy wrap. There is no substitution, sleepy wraps are the best. That thing has saved my life. Best $39 bucks I ever spent.<br>  <br>  Also keep your house between 70-74 degrees<br>  <br>  If you think he has gas rub his tummy in clockwise circles and bring his knees up to his chest rythmically like if he were riding a bicycle.<br>  <br>  If the nursery is yellow paint it a different color because the color yellow causes babies anxiety.<br>  <br>  Music! Zoe sleeps a million times better when I sing to her or she has her pink floyd lullabys on.<br>  <br>  Cloud b makes a sleep sheep that plays ocean, rain, river and whale noises. That thing is great too.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I give her a little formula at bedtime because it keeps her full longer than breast milk so she sleeps longer when I'm getting completely desperate.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck fellow sleepless mom!|`|dnRte8U7aa	A 6 week old should never be "crying it out"... don't pay any attention to that ridiculous suggestion.<br>  <br>  At 6 weeks, a lot of babies go through a growth spurt.  This will make them hungrier, fussier and might disturb their sleep patterns.  If you are nursing, nurse him on demand to increase your milk supply to meet his growth needs.  If you are formula feeding, phone your pediatrician and tell her what's going on so that she can suggest something for you.<br>  <br>  My little girl had a very hard time with sleep the first several weeks of her life.  It took awhile to get her days and nights straightened out, but it does happen!  I know it's soooooo incredibly exhausting right now...<br>  <br>  Try wearing him in a sling.  They like being close to your body, like the movement, and will often sleep very well in there.  This will keep your hands free to do other things.<br>  <br>  Also, my girl does the "panting" thing when she's hungry and when she's got a burp that needs to come out.  The wiggling could also be gas... first make sure he is eating enough and then make sure you burp him really well.<br>  <br>  It gets better, I Promise!  Congrats and good luck. xo<br>  <br>  *edit* what's up with the thumbs-down fairy? LOL|`|sm4wXNOqaa	he's probably hungry...even if he is taking the right amount of formula at this age being on a liquid diet is not satisfying for long.  My daughter had similar sleep problems and I finally started mixing rice cereal in her formula.  I would cut a hole in the nipple so that it could get through and feed it to her.  Her tummy would get full and she would finally sleep.  This isn't an orthodox method but I say that if they are hungry, then let them eat.  If you are nursing, then consider pumping and feeding from a bottle so that you can mix in the cereal. My daughter is almost 14 years old now and sleeping just fine.  The other thing I had to do, and it's hard, is just let her cry.  She eventually went to sleep even though this was painful for me.  Sometimes they just need to cry it out.  Good luck!<br>  ...OK maybe 6 weeks is a little young for a baby to cry it out and another writer so eloquently pointed out...but as they mature babies will need to cry it out at some point.  For a moment, I forgot we were talking about a 6 week old.  But hang in there, it will get better.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	My boy did not sleep well and we found out later he has ADHD. NOT that your baby has that at 6 weeks, but what I am saying is there could be another reason. <br>  <br>  It also could be that he is conditioned to cry everytime you walk away to get your attention. Try letting him work through for a short time period. Try 10 minutes. After a while he will condition himself to lay there and just sleep. If that does not work, speak with the pediatrition, they know best.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	My son was the same way until I gave in and allowed him to sleep on his tummy. Does your son take a paci? If so make sure he has it while he's sleeping! My son doesn't sleep without his paci in his mouth and has to be on his tummy.
oMNXWMs9aa	Anything is possible! You need to go to the Dr. Cause if you are pregnant it is not good for you to be taking the birth control pill. And Yes to me that sounds like implantation bleeding.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	it could be either implantation bleeding or from the pill the only way to know is to test. when you start a pill you usually have some weird things going on down there until your body is used to the hormones, you are also supposed to use back up bc for the first week because your body isnt used to it.|`|fTd509Qzaa	take a test to be sure, if you are, you will want to stop taking your pill|`|4XfjUcvDaa	You could possibly be showing these early signs of pregnancy due to being pregnant or because you were late taking your pill.  Sometimes when taking the pill late it can cause early prego symptoms even if your not prego.<br>  <br>  I would take a test just to be sure, and maybe call you doctor.|`|t0K6Haoyaa	well if you don't take your pill exactly when you are supposed to, that can happen. You need to take a urine test at the dr. to see if you are pregnant to see if you need to stop taking the pill. Also look at another insurance company. My sister has spotting all the time. You may need to switch to another method. I'm on the nuva ring. It's awesome. You never miss a dose. You practically forget about it.
n6XYYyoLaa	first off, as it is caused by a form of herpes, valtrex works wonders if you have a breakout, it is a prescription, but my doc gives me a big bottle and it lasts forever...i don't usuallly get one unless i am sick with a cold or something, but as soon as i get 'that feeling' on my lip, before it even shows up, i can take usually two doses and it never even comes out....something to think about....<br>  when you have a breakout, don't kiss your baby, and be careful where you saliva goes...wash your hands frequently, and don't touch it....<br>  the majority of americans already have the virus whether they have had a breakout or not, a lot are carriers.....might want to ask doc if you can transmit it when you don't have a breakout, i can't remember, but i think there is a small chance....but not enough to not kiss my baby...just not near the mouth....i could be wrong, that class was a lonnnngg time ago, LOL<br>  best wishes, and even if she does get it, it doesn't mean she will have the sores; and they are more common when your immune system is down...like when i have a cold, or you are really stressed out, things that bring your system down allows the virus to overpower it during the stressed times...other times it just lays dormant and waits....i wish that they could 'cure' it so it wouldn't come back....oh well...|`|KmC0K59taa	I haven't heard about this story you mention.<br>  <br>  There are lots of people who get cold sores and even have genital herpes.  I know a few women who gave birth and had herpes.  The babies are fine.<br>  <br>  Your baby might have antibodies.  Just be sure not to kiss your baby while you have one!  And wash your hands a lot if you touch it.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I don't know if this will help, but my mom has gotten cold sores since before my brother and I were born, and she never passed them on to us.  She always made sure not to kiss us on the lips or share food/drink with us when she had a cold sore.  She'd put medication on it and wash her hands frequently if they came in contact with her mouth.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of cold sores being fatal, so maybe that other baby had some underlying condition.  If you're careful, you can certainly keep from passing on the cold sore virus to your little one.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	When you have a cold sore make sure that you don't touch it and try to wash your hands more than normal.  Of course don't kiss baby if possible.<br>  <br>  I'm not familiar with the case you are referring to but yes the complications from cold sores that cause death in newborns are only if contracted during pregnancy or birth, and generally only happen if mom contracts herpes (cold sores, or genital) for the FIRST time during pregnancy.  Otherwise yes baby does have your antibodies, although in rare cases preemies can have problems because if they are born early enough they don't get a full dose of antibodies<br>  <br>  There is another rare complication from cold sores when it spreads to the eyes, it can even happen in adults.  So do try to keep your hands clean, use the medication to limit the spread.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Herpes Simplex virus usually does no harm.  Up to 50% of people have it and experience no serious problems from it.  I am assuming that the baby who died from a herpes virus had an underlying medical condition that affected her immune system and if it hadn't be this virus, it would have probably been another.  Its tragic what happened to that baby, but not common at all.  <br>  It is damn near impossible to keep a sterile envirnoment from mother to baby.  Personally, I would stress about it and go on with life as normal.  It really isn't a big deal.  You wil always be a carrier of it, and you may or may not pass this on to your baby,  they may develop as cold sore at some point in there life as well, they may just carrier, who knows.  But really, its no a big deal.  Most people are carriers of the cold sore virus.
WgIZUcYfaa	Yeah I felt like **** all the time for my entire first trimester. The 2nd trimester is better but I still get morning sickness at night. It sucks.|`|VS8mactUaa	Me too, I feel miserable, I throw up constantly and my prenatal vitamins gives me diarrhea, what a blasted combination.  I feel like death......................................|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i have it off and on , on somedays today is one of them , it is hard i am 30 weeks on sunday and it get old|`|AA10015577	The name morning sickness is misleading because you can have it 'ALL' day.  It varied for me, some days I would feel like poop all day and some days it was just mornings, luckily it was mostly mornings.  Don't worry it should subside very soon, around the beginning of the second trimester, but everyone is different!  GOod luck!|`|lGrcLQ49aa	It happens, and you will get lots of advice on how to feel better.  You will have to try a few things to find what works for you.  Ginger-ale (make sure it has real ginger) and crackers worked for me - and also ginger snaps with real ginger.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and remember - this too shall pass.|`|xnhwmontaa	lol yup you can have all day sickness. Mine has died down *knocks on wood*|`|zmbeIbx7aa	With my son I would be sick of a morning and throw up once (sorry TMI) and be over with it and feel good the rest of the day I had this from the end of my first trimester to the middle of my second. Now that I am pregnant with our little girl although I am over morning sickness I had it horribly bad all through the first trimester into the second. I would be sick all day long and not throw up or anything. I would just be extremely nauseous all the time and I had no appetite at all. I lost 16 pounds in the first trimester because of me not being able to eat anything. Good luck and it will be over soon I hope.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Ohhh yes pretty much all day everyday from 6 weeks until 12 weeks. Not very pleasant but it will subside eventually. When I first complained about this sickness to my doctor she recommended I try 25 mg Unisom (a sleep tablet, but the active ingredient is actually the same as in Benadryl) and vitamin b6 together. When that didn't work, she prescribed me an anti-nausea medication Phenergan. Talk to your doc|`|yKS2UI87aa	My friend did, she was so sick they actually put her in the hospital b/c of dehydration. Mind you this was after 2 weeks of being sick non-stop. It normally calms down at the beginning of the 2nd trimester.|`|e33QAXShaa	With my 1st and this one I was sick ALL day every day. It actually got worse the later in the day it got : (|`|fTd509Qzaa	yup, morning sickness doesn't just happen in the morning.  It can happen any time of day and may or may not subside after your first trimester|`|RjdrO7DVaa	I never threw up all day but I was nauseous all day ... so much for MORNING sickness ... more like "you're gonna feel like **** all day long .. welcome to parenthood"|`|I2UeqxKxaa	i was like that at the begining of my pregnancy some days i was sick all day, and other times it wasnt so bad but i felt sick every day all day its normal it eased off around 12 weeks|`|imIiuaAAaa	During my first trimester I felt horrible, and was pretty much sick all day lol. I know exactly what you're talking about!
zmbeIbx7aa	It could be gas or it could be the baby or it could be your body parts moving around making room for the baby. I would be more likely to think it is gas. As for I didn't feel my first one move until I was 22 weeks and my second moved at 18 weeks. It is normal to feel your first baby move anywhere from 18 to 24 weeks.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Naturally thin women tend to feel it sooner,and women who have had a previous pregnancy. So,yes it's possible.|`|mlgsO5Ztaa	IM PREGANT TOO. <br>  AND GASSY AS ****.|`|3CG3rby0aa	no i felt mine at 3 months too. with 3 of my pregnancies.|`|8RfmosODaa	Is this your first pregnancy if so they say about 20 weeks you feel it and if its your 2nd then you can feel it as early as 16. You might be feeling gas now but you never know! They say if you are slimmer then you can feel it sooner.|`|hOWNwpCLaa	It's possible if you're really thin, or if this is your second child.  However, I'm fairly small, and I didn't feel any flutters until 16 weeks--this is my first baby.
wOyyZjY0aa	My daughter dropped at 32 weeks and I had her at 36 weeks.  I did not notice it over night.  It happened over a course of 2-5 days.  I had a picture of me at 32 weeks and we took another picture 5 days later and you could really notice it.   I noticed though at about the time she dropped I was peeing every single 10 minutes.....I'm not kidding you.<br>  Best of luck!!!|`|fTd509Qzaa	it could be that your baby has moved a little.  32 weeks is awfully early to be dropping.  I think one of the signs of labor is your baby dropping.  So I would guess labor follows soon after the baby drops.<br>  Not entirely sure, had c-section at 35 weeks with my son, never had the feeling of him dropping, he lived in my rib cage :)|`|01vMpHkWaa	i started to drop at around 35 weeks<br>  and just the other day i actually could feel him drop ....and i know he did because he is no longer in my ribs<br>  <br>  i havnt given  birth yet though|`|K542Db29aa	i think i dropped 35weeks or earlier and still pregnant lol but i keep dropping a little more each time :) but see i have been wondering do you drop a lot more when it comes time to deliver?? :) good luck to you hope all is well

96ydDKocaa	contractions will be your whole belly tightening up at the same time you may even feel it around into your back and they will start coming at timed intervals, you could also be feeling braxton hicks they are like contractions but just getting your uterus ready for delivery you can get a contraction at any time during your pregnancy|`|s7FBDZpbaa	they feel like REALLLLY REALLLLY really, bad period cramps..i started having contractions on valentines day and had a baby by 2 in the morning|`|KGppArcfaa	At first they feel like cramps,(when I first went into labour, i thought Ha! this isnt so bad...i had no clue what was coming. By the time I was 4cm dilated it felt like my womb was opening every time, it hurt) the more dilated you get, the more excruciating your contractions get.<br>  I dont know how to explain it. I never had any braxton hicks or anything with pregnancy but they are common.|`|AA11538461	My contractions felt nothing at all like period cramps.  It is a tightening of the uterus accompanied by a dull ache.  They come and go at regular intervals.  I started getting braxton hicks as early as eight weeks with the second and later pregnancies.

That way he can look at all that stuff when he gets a little older.
dDVAUA9saa	With this pregnancy, I have been ill and have a toddler at home so have not been too terribly active.  I go on the treadmill or do aquafit and weights about once a week.  I've gained 12lbs so far (24 weeks pregnant)<br>  <br>  For my first pregnancy i was very active.  I did aquafit once a week, aerobics, stationary cycling, walking outside, running/walking on treadmill, elliptical trainer, and weights (5-7lbs).  I gained 18lbs.|`|iP863XM6aa	Well, I'm only 17 weeks pregnant and pretty much all the weight i gained is in my boobs i think so far. But one thing i try to do is take walks whenever its not too cold (i know how you feel, im in cold weather also in Canada). whenever i cant go outside, i will normally just walk up and down the stairs for awhile until my legs give out :p i like it because it really gets your heart going and after youve rested, you feel even more energized. If you dont have any stairs in your house, you could also use just a little stool or anything that you can just step on and of while watching tv. You can do it really fast and then slow it down, like you could keep it a steady beat the whole time. Whatever you feel comfortable with.<br>  Another thing i do is a work out i saw on Ellen Degeneris :p Its not too demanding and it works to stay in shape :p<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjG03oPZYwE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjG03oPZY...</a><br>  <br>  check it out. You might like it. Good Luck :)|`|xX0zKzw8aa	I also am gaining most of my weight in my thighs and butt, I don't fit my panties anymore! What I am doing to stay active during winter is I shovel the snow, my husband just does the lifting of it onto the snowbank.  We also go to the public pool once a week, seems to be helping out, I am 21 weeks and have went from 94lbs to 108.5lbs|`|c6bde8f9a87bbbe5e37ddc75d9270523aa	I worked 2 jobs.<br>  <br>  I gained 50lbs and lost most of it after I delivered. Keep in mind that you have a baby, water, a placenta and an umbilical cord helping with that extra weight so if the doc doesn’t think it’s an unhealthy weight gain then I wouldn’t worry about it till after you deliver the baby.|`|mGhzmZC2aa	I always find that having activity scheduled into your day helps. I carried on walking to work. It's 2.5 miles there, another 2.5 miles if I don't get a lift back. Try to get a good brisk walk everyday, it doesn't cost anything. Find some excuse to go out, pop out to the shops or the library or whatever you can think of!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Walk. <br>  If its too cold, go to the mall and walk there for an hour a day. <br>  It will be a huge help, trust me. <br>  <br>  I'm all belly and boobs this pregnancy thankfully.
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Jacob is almost 9 months old and occasionally I'll give him finger food to try and feed himself but he never gets it in his mouth...just holds it in his hands or throws it on the floor..I havent let him try a spoon yet.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I always let my babies feed themselves, I do not spoon feed them.<br>  <br>  My first started eating at 6 months.  My second loved to taste food, and chew it, but didn't swallow anything until he was 10 months.  And if you gave him food that he couldn't easily spit out he would scream until you cleaned out his mouth for him.<br>  <br>  My first learned to use a spoon at about 12 months.  My second surprised me by using a spoon perfectly from the moment his brother handed it to him at 9 months.|`|n2i9SnGPaa	Hi there, I work with babies and at 8months we would be introducing lots of finger foods, we would also encourage the baby to explore their food. If the baby was having cereal etc which requires a spoon we would give the baby a spoon and have one ourselves, this allows the baby to copy you and to attempt feeding whilst you make sure they are getting plenty to eat. (A little tip - take the highchair into the kitchen and put down a splash mat, this will be easier to clean and will reduce your reaction of trying to tidy up throughout the meal).<br>  <br>  Have fun. lol.  X|`|OHq5gSjJaa	My daughter started at 7 months.  She absolutely refused to be spoon-fed, so I basically had to let her start trying to feed herself or she wouldn't be eating anything.  She is great with finger foods like little puffs, or pieces of fruit.  She actually is even pretty decent with a spoon.  Sure its a little messy, but it usually only takes me about 4 wipes to clean up her hands, face, and the high chair.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	We started with finger foods (cheerios, bits of banana, diced carrots, cheese) stuff they could practice their aim with.  Once they found their mouths with their hands it was pretty fun to watch them with a spoon. Most stuff dumped out before making it to the mouth, but that's why we got a dog - to pick up the bits that hit the floor.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	i think thats a good practise. he'll learn quickly.

But our son is almost 11 months old and weighs 22-23 lbs. so we've gotten some good use out of it(bought it when he was 4 months old).|`|wHOQXToHaa	I would say buying those trays for the Bumbo. Although they are almost as expensive as the Bumbo! Another suggestion would be to wrap a boppy in the front of the bumbo for extra support, or if he leans forward too much he will have a cushiony fall too. Another thought would be a toddler swing- you can buy pretty small portable ones and some of them you can adjust how high they are sitting up.|`|htfyL6I2aa	yep, he's outgrowing the bouncer.  bummer!  You have to move up to the next containment toy, the exesaucer or the jumperoo.  personally my son hated his jumperoo.  We have this <a href="http://www.brightstarts.com/BSSub14x53x1x6798.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brightstarts.com/BSSub14x53x1...</a> and he has used it since he was 4 months old.  My son outgrew the seat around 12-13 months, he doesn't want to sit in it anymore, but the chair comes off and he still uses the table for snacks and playing while standing up.  It has been the best toy and longest lasting by far.  he is 17 months old now.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	Exersaucer or Jumperoo.  If he can sit up, either of the seats in these toys will help him learn to hold his torso upright and prepare him for standing.  Also they can teach him to start bearing some weight on his legs if he isn't already doing so.  My 8 month old has both of these (gifts from spoiling grandmas!) and LOVES them both, can play in them for 15-20 minutes at a time.  Plenty of time for us to have dinner or if one of us is home alone with him and has to run to the bathroom :)|`|heDtLdz5aa	they make trays for the bumbo...that way you can still put him in that without the fear of him toppling over...<br>  <br>  here is website for it...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nextag.com/bumbo-tray/products-html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextag.com/bumbo-tray/product...</a><br>  <br>  good suggestion noah's mommy....i had the rain forest one...but if i had to do it all over i would choose the baby einstien one...it is more busy than the rainforest jumperoo...|`|hPG2pedLaa	I LOVE LOVE the baby einstein jumper we got our daughter, it grows with the child (shes now 9months ol;d and smaller as well) its a must have in our home to have a quiet dinner hands free =] they sell them at babies r us , shes been using her since she was 4months old|`|ADEDkCgOaa	its fine if he does that in the bumbo seat. its made to not fall over when kids are leaning back to look at things. also an exersaucer or a walker will work for him to sit up. if you need to wrap a blanket around him to help him sit up then thats fine. a boopy pillow also works.|`|blKmv7bmaa	rap a blanket around him when u put him in it i do that for my son and it works|`|qIWUC1Ceaa	what about a jumperoo.|`|664f65654de0942122f1fdc6bc3b6675aa	The bumbo will suction to the table if you put some pressure on the center piece and there is a tray that you can but for it and they are not that expensive.  I would suggest the seat for the bath tub that has the suction cups on the bottom.  It would stick to your table and if he leans it should not turn over.
1os95dHZaa	Yes of course it can! It happened on Days Of Our Lives with Sammy Lucas and E.J. Duh!|`|n560blqraa	This is a very rare anomaly that can occur. However, statistically speaking your chances of this occurring are next to nil. There is a rare phenomena that occurs in a woman while taking fertility drugs that while one egg has been fertilized and has developed slowly, a second egg can become fertilized because the entrance is not completely closed off or blocked allowing the sperm to penetrate. Again, this is a very rare anomaly to occur in women taking strong fertility drugs. Normal conception methods have not seen this anomaly.<br>  <br>  Please  note: How rare this occurrence is in women on fertility drugs. In addition, this must occur at point of conception only. If your wife has already become pregnant, this would have needed to occur the day she became pregnant. After that, there is no way possible during the entire 9 months she is pregnant ,to get pregnant again during her duration of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  In addition, please be aware that this is not the same thing as One fertilized egg that splits and divides into two, which creates twins. (fraternal or identical)|`|xisGJccaaa	what are you 12?|`|ebM6CxRQaa	ACTUALLY she can VERY RARE but some women have two uterus... and they get pregnant after they already are. I saw it on the discovery channel. It is absolutly the MOST rare thing in the world... For the most part NO she cannot.

I wouldn't say that's basic biology.  What if her ovary did release an egg in the middle of pregnancy and the sperm found it?  I know I'll get all kinds of thumbs down for this, but I felt I should defend this poor guy as I think of myself as a fairly educated woman, and it still occurred to me that this might happen, even if it's extremely rare.  I just don't think it's that dumb of a question.  Isn't that why Y!A is here, anyway?|`|TNiX3jQ8aa	no...r u stupid? Of course not, once you have fertilised an egg, thats it. Done, she is pregnant. Did you not do gcse biology? In fact ks3 biology? sheesh....|`|AA12395149	Only if she has more than one uterus (this is VERY rare).|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	No she can't get pregnant if she already is pregnant. Do the world a favor and don't ask this question again.|`|AA10972821	NO- please revisit biology 101.|`|n7sSVsryaa	No....<br>  If shes pregnant, shes pregnant... she cant get pregnant while being pregnant.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	LOL...genius!!!|`|4vdINuv6aa	Oh dear god..<br>  No she can't pregnant again if she is already pregnant.|`|VnRECJJxaa	wow!<br>  <br>  no no she can not, periods stop eggs aren't being released any more during pregnancy so no|`|AA10770446	tard|`|nAwQiPt2aa	no you cant but try it mite work for you|`|diT2WFfCaa	No. <br>  <br>  When a woman becomes pregnant, her body releases hormones that stop her ovaries from releasing eggs.  No egg, no baby.<br>  <br>  Twins happen for one of two reasons: either the woman's ovaries released two eggs by mistake, and both of them were fertilized by sperm, OR the egg splits in two early on in the pregnancy, before it's really even begun to develop.|`|oENe16luaa	Yes.  A friend of mine had fraternal twins naturally.  The doctor said that what usually happens with these ladies is two eggs are released during a cycle.

CiFR2xuBaa	I had pretty much the same experience as bubba b. On top of that the anesthesiologist  swore that he couldn't get the epidural inserted correctly so I had to go thru the pain for 19 hours, hoping that I would progress but I didn't. I don't know if it was the pitocin or what but my labor was HORRIBLE! I ended up having an emergency c-section and had to be put to sleep since nothing could stop my contractions. Please don't do this to yourself.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Go easy; castor oil can induce vomiting.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	oh no.  i did this with 2 of my pregnancies & i did it for NOTHING!!!!  all that will happen is lots, & i mean LOTS of diarrhea!  you need to make sure that you drink lots & lots of water or juice or something because the reason as to why some people go into labor is because it causes you to dehydrate.  this is very unsafe & i didn't do it for the last baby.  i know how you feel about wanting to have the baby now because you are just so over being pregnant right now but try to be strong it won't be long.  short of breaking your water yourself, i strongly suggest you don't do this!!!!! there really is no cure all for starting labor.  <br>  good luck!|`|AA12395149	I wouldn't recommend castor oil because it's unpredictable.  The painful cramping you'll experience is more likely to be from the bowels rather than the uterus (though the uterus will be irritated by it as well).  You also will have loose stools and possible diarrhea for an unknown amount of time.  It's better to ask your doctor or midwife before going about such ways of self induction.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your delivery.|`|28QPS6V9aa	I took castor oil with my first (big mistake) when I was 39 weeks pregnant. I took two tablespoons with two tablespoons orange juice then chugged a glass of water. I took it at 10:00 at night and by 2:00 in the morning I was starting to feel sick. I was up all night and by 9:00 am I noticed heavy bleeding like a period. My husband and I rushed to the hospital and I was checked and I was four centimeters. It worked! I was in labor. But it wasn't worth it. I was in labor for twenty eight hours and I really think it was because of the castor oil, not only was my labor long but my contractions stopped in the middle and I stopped dilating so I was forced to have pitocin since my water had already broken. I really wish I wouldn't have used castor oil. But it did work for me! Had my daughter at 39 weeks, about eight months ago.  Good luck!|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	It does but a table spoon isnt going to do anything for you. I drank 2 medium size cups of caster oil and orange juice(half and half) and 8 hours later I had a beautiful very healthy baby boy(he just turned one on the 23rd). I also did it with my 3 yr old. Just know that if you throw some of it up dont keep taking it. It's gross I had to plug my nose and not think about it. Had to amp myself up. Took me about 5 minutes to gulp it down after i made it. SMH Good luck sweetie!<br>  <br>    It doesnt work for everyone. some people get really sick from it. Some dont. I guess it only works for some people. I have always had a good experience. Makes my labor go quick so they cant force any drugs on me. If I carry this baby to term which it's looking like I wont I will be using it again for the third time.

I'm so excited and I know you are too.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Nope, I don't even have mine yet.  I'll get it this weekend at my shower. <br>  I won't need the diaper bag for a while so I'll just put it in the closet.  I do have my hospital bag packed, but there is no need to bring the diaper bag to the hospital since they give you diapers there.

b8f0CfSsaa	mIU is a term for the levels of hCG that can be detected in a test.<br>  <br>  10 mIU tests are very sensitive and can test as early as 10 days past ovulation, however some doctors recommend you don't take them as they are sensitive enough to pick up an embryo before it attaches, so if it doesn't attach it can be upsetting.<br>  <br>  25 mIU is the typical level for early tests such as first response which claim to be able to test up to 5 days before your period is due, however some women will not reach even 18 mIU until they are 6 weeks pregnant so don't be disheartened if they don't work.<br>  <br>  Mosts tests are 50-100 mIU, they can be taken after you have missed a period.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  <br>  Ahhhh another POAS addict (me too!). It is estimated that a womans hCG levels double every 2-3 days. You may be very early. Going by the article I have posted a link to below you could be between 3 and 5 weeks!<br>  <br>  EDIT2: What test are you using by the way? And you could get a BFP on first response with that.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	The 10 will be much more sensitive than the 30. If you are taking the test prior to your periods due date then you would want to take the 10 test. If you have already missed your period then the 30 should due, but if you haven't bought any test yet, I would always buy the 10 as it will have much more accurate results. Good luck!
goJrMw9Naa	I would say between 2 and 3 hundred times a day.|`|01vMpHkWaa	im 39 weeks and i got about 2 times an hour<br>  <br>  and during the night im up about 3 times|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	4 times  atime and like 15 times a day|`|uuHPneEcaa	All the time. u go to the rest room so many times its hard to count.  expecially when u are further along because the weight of the baby is on ur bladder.<br>  <br>  everytime my son moves i have to go to the rest room.. (he moves all day (yesterday he moved from 6:30am to midnight) in the middle of the night I wake up every hour on the hour to use the rest room. (sometimes twice in a hour)|`|K1iUzewyaa	women urinate a lot more often during pregnancy. Especially if the baby is active, he/ she will push on your bladder, and you will need to go all of a sudden.. pretty cool.. my girl went through that with our boy...|`|J2glFOkhaa	I used to pee once a day typically, maybe twice. <br>  <br>  Now I pee first thing in the morning, and like 4 times at night. I hate it, I just want to stay in bed but I have to get up|`|fWAzJIEkaa	Im only very early in my pregnancy, but i go atleast 2-3 times an hour.. but it must be cause i drink alot of water aswell =)|`|fTd509Qzaa	depends on how far along you are.  As the baby gets bigger, there is more and more pressure on your bladder, which means you go more often.  I am 36 weeks right now, I must go between 5 and 10 times a day.  We go through a lot of toilet paper :)|`|4XfjUcvDaa	ummm between 100-150 times a day! LOL it actually depends on how the baby is laying.  I feel that I go more when i am laying down rather then walking around.  But there is always the urge to have to pee even if nothing comes out!|`|sXCSVFBaaa	I'm 32 weeks and I urinate usually every 1-2 hours. It's more or less depending on how much I drink.|`|I2UeqxKxaa	im 17 weeks and am constantly needin a wee lol i have to get up around 3 times a night where as b4 i was pregnant i didnt need to go at all thru the nite|`|TflIiMKPaa	I do not think spaghetti sauce makes me urinate any more than usual|`|WVDxmmXXaa	my girlfriend had twins and had to go pee every hour or two just because their was no room (bladder size)|`|W6S6WpsNaa	ALOT!|`|KPYQwyeraa	as i got further along i was urinating like every 45 mins lol <br>  ~cat|`|LlrgUJknaa	during my 4 months i would urinate ALOT!! but now that i'm 7 months i usually go around 2-3 times a day.|`|eGfAXaV3aa	Put it this way....you might seriously begin to consider putting a toilet in your bed...or wearing adult diapers....its ruthless!
qKEKLOaEaa	My daughter started getting little bumps on her bottom gums and showing signs of teething at about 8 months but her teeth didn't pop through until about 11 months. She had 2 teeth at a year and is getting ready to pop another one at 13 months. Some babies can start getting teeth at 4 months and others as late as 15 months. I wouldn't worry, they will pop through when they are ready ( and when they do, be sure to have lots of cold teething rings on hand). Good luck! :)|`|AA11210211	My daughter is almost 13 months and has 2 top teeth and two bottom teeth and is working on her top right eye tooth,she was about 8 months when she got her bottom two teeth.My son was 4 month when he got his first two teeth.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	my dd CUT her first tooth at exactly ten weeks...her dad, myself and doc saw it, then it swelled up and covered the tip; so she has been pretty much teething since then with diff ones swelling and hurting and drooling like a rabid monkey, and still had no teeth that we can see....it's pretty frustrating....right now she is having a bad spell, they come and go, but it feel like it is the very back tooth on the left side of her mouth and that is where she sticks everything to chew on...(has even gagged herself mult times bc she used her fingers); she also has a swollen area around her right eye tooth....but she still has that gummy smile and will be nine mos tomorrow...:0)|`|VY4LqfLpaa	our son just turned 8 months old.  He's been teething for almost 4 months now, but still no teeth.  His teething hasn't been too bad, occasional outbursts and issues with his gums and stuff, but nothing too bad though...I can see little white lines that look like grains of rice and occasionally feel something on his bottom gums, but still nothing though...|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Don't worry about it, this within the realm of norm. You will find that there are variances betwen children as to how fact they develop. If the bumps are present, the teeth are coming. Enjoy the time while she is young and don't worry unless your doctor tells you there is a real problem.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	My friends baby was 13 months when she got her first tooth she was very late starter.  Babies can get teeth anytime between from the time they are born up to 12 months.or slightly older  Some babies are even born with teeth.  Very rare but has happened.  I would say if she does not get her first tooth by her first birthday then get her checked.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My son didn't get any teeth until after his first birthday. Now, he is 17 months old and he has at least 10 teeth.|`|c9NuCZnaaa	my son is the same. it seems to be he's always teething but never getting any teeth! He's 9 months old tomorrow and only has two bigger bumps on the bottom and two smaller ones on the top but you still can't see anything yet. Kids dont get all their baby teeth until they're about 2-3 years old so you'll most likely have a hell of a time when they're 1-2 and they all start coming through!! scary stuff!!|`|AA10972821	My son didn't get his teeth until he was 9 months old, and then it seemed like they all popped up at once!  He got the two bottom front one day and the next the two top front came in.  His mouth must have hurt every day for about 4 months, but he didn't really complain about it.  Don't worry- it'll happen soon enough!!|`|txv7TIgiaa	the bumps will soon be teeth...my daughter got her first at 5 months though... don't worry your babys teeth will come when she needs them she doesn't need them yet...
4YfehneDaa	No it doesnt hurt, as far as when it totally depends, it might not break at all until close to delivery.  For me, it was a little trickle, i thought i peed my pants a little , but everytime i stood up, a little would come out.  It only happens before labor to 15% of people anyway, so i wouldn't worry that much about it, some people suggest using a waterproof mattress pad just in case it happens in the middle of the night, and you dont want to ruin your mattress. Good luck with the birth!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My waters broke on their own and it didn't hurt. It actually felt like i'd wet myself.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no it doesn't hurt and it really depends on if the sac just tear or burst- i had pretty much a gush- i knew what it was and it felt like i was continuously peeing myself. only about 15 % of women's water break before labor starts<br>   contractiosn don't always kick in right afterwards either in most cases it cna be several hours later|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well my waters broke during labour while in hospital, it was a big gush and to be honest it was relieving then. if your waters break before then it could be either...the trickling will be a constant thing particualarly when you move, so if you suspect it has broke put on a pad and keep an ye...if its a gush trust me you will know|`|SCY0bOr5aa	My water never broke. With my 1st born I was already 10 cm when I got to the Hospital. They broke it but never felt much of anything. With my Daughter they broke it when I was about 6 or 7 cm it feel like a really warm gush. It kept leaking for about an hour. There was no pain.|`|xnhwmontaa	No it doesn't hurt. It can be a big gush or a trickle all depends don't worry! Good Luck|`|AA10972821	No it doesn't hurt!  I woke up from a dead sleep because I heard what I thought was a loud POP- but my husband kept snoozing. Went to the bathroom and there were several "gushes" of water because the baby was moving around and I was moving around.  Definitely get some of those adult pads for incontinence because a regular maxi pad doesn't cut it!!  I also put a towel on the seat of the car "just in case" but everything worked out fine.  GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|JgU9vaP4aa	my water broke. it just was a pop like feeling and water started to trickle down my leg. almost like i  wet myself from pee. i cleaned myself up. but then it just continued for almost an hour.<br>  i went to the hospital with a blanket under me and when i got there my pants were wet as well as the blanket. it was a slow release almost. no pain. (that came a few hours later! ha ha) <br>  if u have any kind of wettness and you feel your water is torn or broken u should go to the ER. once the water starts to leak it can mean the cervix is open and infection can get inside and if they think your water  is broken u ust be admited.|`|4t5eGShiaa	No, it doesnt hurt when your water breaks. And it could be a big gush or a trickle. I got lucky... i was a trickler! (It happened at work!) Could you imagine the pool of water at work? LOL. <br>  <br>  Since you are due any day now.. you should start wearing a maxi pad.. to help absorb - some - of the fluid when it does happen.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|iPGxXRHgaa	It varies from woman to woman. I've had 3 children & only felt my waters break with my last son, i stood up & felt a little sharp pain down my left side, it was like a bubbling feeling. Then i just felt my waters trickling out!! It was quite amazing!! Good luck xx|`|e33QAXShaa	No it's doesn't hurt but it can break either way. When mine broke with my 1st it was a huge gush that just kept coming. If the baby's head is down low it can cover the cervix and just drip though. <br>  <br>  Good luck & congrats!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Nope, but the contracations kick in right afterwards. <br>  It could be a trickle or a gush, just depends. <br>  Many women don't have their water break until they are already in the hospital.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Kinda a gush because it's what protects the baby and when your water breaks the baby is coming out<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK xx bless you

Both progestin and estrogen are approved by the AAP for use by nursing moms. Children whose mothers used hormonal birth control while nursing have been followed as late as 17 years of age. The exception to this is the very young baby - less than 6 weeks old. There may be some concern about the baby's immature liver being able to metabolize the hormones passed through the milk well enough.<br>  <br>  Any hormonal birth control may cause fussiness in the baby (not reported in the literature but often anecdotally by mothers). This may be due to the hormones causing a minimal decrease in the protein/nitrogen/lactose content of the milk. Some mothers have reported marked improvement in their baby's degree of fussiness once they come off hormonal birth control.<br>  <br>  Effects on mother: If you had gestational diabetes during pregnancy, talk to your doctor about the safety of using the mini-pill while breastfeeding. A 1998 study conducted at the University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles (Kjos SL, et al. Contraception and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Latina women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus. JAMA. 1998 Aug 12;280(6):533-8.) indicated that for certain women, taking the mini-pill while breastfeeding may increase the risk of chronic, non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This study of more than 900 Latinas found that those who had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and then took mini-pills while breastfeeding had an almost threefold risk of developing type II diabetes within a year, compared with those who used different contraception. This study concentrated on Hispanic women, and thus it is not clear whether the results can be applied to all ethnic groups. Other, smaller studies on the mini-pill did not show any increased rates of diabetes, so more research in needed on this subject. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Combination contraceptives<br>  <br>  It's recommended that any estrogen-containing contraceptive be avoided until baby is at least six months old AND after baby is well-established on solid foods.<br>  <br>  Combination contraceptives contain both progesterone and estrogen and come in several different forms:<br>  <br>      * The combination birth control pill (Alesse, Yasmin, Seasonale, Mircette, Loestrin, Lo/ovral, Demulen, Desogen, Nordette, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Triphasil, Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, Ovral, etc.)<br>      * the monthly injection (Lunelle)<br>      * the birth control patch (Ortho Evra)<br>      * the vaginal ring (NuvaRing).<br>  <br>  Milk supply: Estrogen-containing contraceptives have been linked to low milk supply and a shorter duration of breastfeeding even when started when baby is older, after milk supply is well established. Not all mothers who take contraceptives containing estrogen will experience a low milk supply, but these unaffected mothers appear to be a very small minority.<br>  <br>  Safety: Both progestin (progesterone) and estrogen are approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for use in breastfeeding mothers. See below for additional information on side effects related to lactation.<br>  <br>   <br>  Progestin-only contraceptives<br>  <br>  Progestin-only contraceptives are the preferred choice for breastfeeding mothers when something hormonal is desired or necessary.<br>  <br>  Progestin-only contraceptives come in several different forms:<br>  <br>      * the progestin-only pill (POP) also called the "mini-pill" (Micronor, Errin, Nor-QD, Ovrette, Microval, etc)<br>      * the birth control injection (Depo Provera)<br>      * the progesterone-releasing IUD (Mirena, Progestasert)<br>      * the birth control implant (Norplant, Implanon).<br>  <br>  Milk supply: For most mothers, progestin-only forms of contraception do not cause problems with milk supply if started after the 6th-8th week postpartum and if given at normal doses. However, there are many reports (most anecdotal but nevertheless worth paying attention to) that some women do experience supply problems with these pills, so if you choose this method you still need to proceed with some caution.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in one of the longer lasting progestin-only forms of birth control (the Depo-Provera shot lasts at least 12 weeks, but effects may be seen up to a year; the Mirena/Progestasert IUD and the Norplant implant can last up to 5 years), it may be a good idea to do a trial of progestin-only pills (mini-pill) for a month or more before deciding on the longer-term form of birth control. If you find that you are among the women whose supply drops significantly due to progestin-only birth control, you can simply discontinue the pills - rather than struggling with low milk supply for several months until the shot wears off or you get the implant or IUD removed.<br>  <br>  Do note that the Mirena/Progestasert IUD delivers its hormone directly to the lining of the uterus, which only leads to a slight increase in progesterone levels in the blood stream (much lower than that found with the progesterone-only pill). As a result, there is much less chance of side effects from the progesterone than from the Depo-Provera shot or mini-pill.<br>  <br>  Milk composition: At higher doses than normal this type of pill can affect the content of breastmilk. At these higher doses it has been shown to decrease the protein/nitrogen and lactose content of the milk. At regular doses, this does not seem to be as likely.<br>  <br>  Safety: Progestin (progesterone) is approved by the AAP for use in breastfeeding mothers. See below for additional information on side effects related to lactation.|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	i started the day after i had my son taking the pill and no it didn't bother my milk supply at all but ask your doctor when he puts you on something let him know you are going to breast feed and he can make sure it don't hurt your milk supply or your baby depo shot works great though i was on that with my other two children and breast feed them and you don't have to worry about missing a day when your busy|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	The only hormonal contraceptive suitable during breastfeeding is the progesterone only pill (mini pill).

jwIdq5qkaa	In a parenting class in high school, (parenting was a class for people who wanted to go in to child care centers) our book said you weren't supposed to because if the water was extremely hot it could hurt the baby. It can cause your heart rate to speed up this causing the baby to stress out. Your baby also can't regulate its temp yet like we can.  Pools don't cool you off that quick and doesn't affect heart rate because most people are relaxed in a pool. I found some good information about it in the following website.<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe-to-take-hot-baths-while-im-pregnant_1245313.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe...</a>|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You can take hot baths, it hot tubs that are kept at extremely high temps that you should avoid for long periods of time. Your baby's temp is generally 2 degrees higher than yours so as long as your temp stays below 101 then your baby will stay below 103 and everything is fine. If you are freezing then your baby is still 2 degrees warmer than you and is not as cold. If you jump into a pool and it brings your 98 degree temp down to 96 then your baby's temp is still at 98 so it causes no harm.|`|wLBsgNKAaa	I think the hot shower thing is an old wives' tale.  We are mammals, which means that our body temperature is not affected by outside temperatures.  This is the reason we can live in really cold places like Siberia or really hot places like Cuba.  <br>  <br>  Swimming is a wonderful excercise and your baby will be fine!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Swimming doesn't lower your body temperature by too much because you are staying active while in the water.|`|hOWNwpCLaa	There's a big difference between hot baths, and the cold water in a pool.  I'd think that the pool water would bring some relief from the summer time heat.  Pool water couldn't lower your body temperature enough for it to do any harm...|`|WXExyAlWaa	Not really - the water isn't horribly cold, and you're moving around a lot, and your body naturally regulates itself to stay at about the same temperature all the time.

You don't really need plates for a while since everything will be very liquidy for quite some time.  I know they sell bowls that suction cup to the table or high chair tray - I think these could be a good investment since DD loves to fling all her toys off her high chair tray already (or is just so uncoordinated still that that is what ends up happening!<br>  <br>  I should keep my eye on this question myself to see if anyone has brand preferences or anything; we basically just picked stuff somewhat at random.|`|n2i9SnGPaa	Hi there, initially I would go for little pots with lids as your baby will be feeding quite often and it will be difficult to just pick something up for them.

I like them because the hold the right amount of food for an infant who's beginning feeding. A good Spoon is the Nuby brand that has an indicator of temperature... which is cool but you not needed much.<br>  As for bowls any bowls really, now if you're travelling also from the First Years are this containers that are divided in two compartiments with a lid, so you place your baby food and fruit in there. <br>   When your baby gets older and starts feeding by herself you can get different spoons.. the best I found with my kids are the Gerber kind, that have  solid rubber grip and a stainleess steel scoop. They're short and are great for little hands.<br>  Then sippy cups is another story... every kids likes her own sippy cup!! My daughter did very well with the Nuby brand ones.. that have a soft spout-like a bottle-so it was easy to transition. Also she really liked was the suzy's zoo sippy cups mainly for the pics and the handles made it easy for her to hold.<br>  My son wasnt too fussy he was fine with the Avent ones.. but my lil princess wouldnt take a "plain" sippy cup LOL anyways... hope I helped!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I like the Ikea bowls, spoons, and plates.<br>  <br>  PS just because ONE doctor says its time doesn't make them right.

b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Okay, sorry I had to answer because nobody else is. I'm not a woman with a bicornate (heart shaped) uterus, but I am the child of a woman with one :) <br>  <br>  Mom has three kids, of the three of us, two were "whoopsies" (including me.) My sister, the only one who was planned, was conceived very quickly. So mom had absolutely no problem getting pregnant- even on birth control. <br>  <br>  I am not sure about the period thing, sorry, but I do know that mom was fairly far along with each of us before she found out she was pregnant- with me, she was 3 months along before she knew- she thought she had the flu because of vomiting and finally she took the test. <br>  <br>  Mom did require C-sections because of her bicornate uterus, and after three C-sections the doctor advised her to not have any more kids. That was because of the uterus thinning and all the scar tissue after so many incisions, though, not because of the condition. And these births were all in the late 70s and early 80s, most doctors will let you have more than 3 kids by C-section now. <br>  <br>  Mom had relatively textbook pregnancies, she had it easier than most people. There were no complications, except with my brother she had a mild kidney infection after the birth, but I think that's safe to say it was unrelated. Nothing with the two of us girls. So pretty much, in her case, it didn't affect anything but the method of childbirth. All three of us are healthy, and we were healthy babies too- colic free, weighing between 7 and 8 lbs, perfectly normal. I'm expecting a little girl in 8 days. I don't have a bicornate uterus and neither does my sister (I wondered if this was hereditary, in our case I guess not.)<br>  <br>  I hope that helps :) Good luck to you!|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I don't have this condition but I did some online research for you. I posted some sites below.  It seems there are varying degrees of this condition (some are mild and some much worse).  I found that it doesn't really increase your chances for first trimester miscarriages but it does increases the risk of 2nd trimester miscarriages and preterm labor.  It is common for babies to be breech (bottom first) and therefore c-sections are more common than vaginal deliveries with women having this condition.<br>  <br>  Most things that I read stated that if you are aware of the condition before or early on in the pregnancy then your doctor can monitor you closely and prevent many of the issues that can arise from this condition.  There are options to help a women have a successful pregnancy and delivery.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!
MfcTIdlraa	Hi, Mommy!<br>  What you need to do is some relaxation exercises.  I could run you through some here, but your best bet is to go to a store (formerly called "head store") and buy relaxation tapes/CDs.  They come in the form of Gaelic songs, whale songs, ocean waves on the shore, people guiding you through relaxation and so many others.<br>  They really do work.  You need to devote 30-45 minutes of your time to relax.<br>  Good luck, Happy baby, and feel well!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Oh gosh girly!!!!  Well, I have some pretty bad anxiety myself.  I probably need to be on medication myself, but what I did while I was pregnant.  I'd go into a different area or room from anyone and would breath in and out really deep breaths until I calmed down and it always worked.  <br>  <br>  I got stressed a lot at work while I was pregnant.

I would listen to your doctor though! If he says that you are at low risk of a m/c, then I would trust him! Of course, everyone says not to worry so much because that isnt good for the baby, and you already know that.. I think they further you get along in your pregnancy, the better and more secure your going to feel about everything!! Good luck, and I am almost dont with my Provera, so hopefully I'll get my period and then its baby making time! lol I am just trying to keep my mind off of it because they say once you relaz, thats when it happens! lol We are about to put our house up for sale, so I am busy busy doing that!!!!|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	I lessened my load... in my case, my job was causing a lot of the anxiety on me so I resigned and I really made a good choice bec. I was able to get healthy and focus on my pregnancy.  I dont regret it.  But if that is not an option for you, just take some time out for yourself to breathe, relax and try to do things that will take your mind off the anxiety. This is not uncommon esp. due to the day to day stress of being pregnant and other things. Look for signs such as major cramping or spotting... and call your dr immediately.  Dont worry about calling your dr all the time, it is their job to advice you and make sure you are having a safe pregnancy.  There came a point when the nurses seemed like they were annoyed about me calling all the time but oh well.  It is their job!|`|7yd7lNU7aa	I know how you feel. I have been on meds for over 9 years because of high anxiety. I am 14 weeks and haven't taken any meds since I found out. I have a fear of leaving the house as well. It has been very hard and I'm am almost to my limit. The few things that have helped me are 1: Taking the dog for at least a 20 minute walk every day.2: I clean the house a lot. 3: I was doing volunteer work at my daughter's school; it's simple and you are busy so you don't think about it as much. <br>  My midwife recomeded that I try a mind trick where you pat your hands on your knees one hand at a time going back and forth. It actually has helped calm from an anxiety attack. <br>  Best Wishes!|`|TtutLPsQaa	Hello! I suffer from anxiety as well, but thankfully only from time to time. There is a specific yoga designed just for pregnant women, and it's supposed to help with anxiety/stress/discomfort. You might look into it, see where/how much it is in your area. Another thing that helps is a technique called "grounding." I'm not sure about you, but when I would have anxiety it would grow rapidly to where I'd cry, shake, my hands would sweat and basically a panic attack.I saw a therapist who told me when I felt anxious I needed to grab a hold of myself, like grab my legs, take deep calming breaths, and think of a place that I felt safe and happy in, a person I felt safe with, etc. I would close my eyes and listen to my breathing. It helped quite a bit for me. Something else you could try to do is when you start to think of your baby and a m/c than lay or sit comfortably and put on some soothing music, light some candles. Good luck, sounds like you've passed the risky times for the most part! I know you've experienced a lot w/ this pregnancy, but I don't think God would bring you this far only to snatch it away. :)|`|ECPdAeHQaa	I have anxiety as well and it is very hard to go away. Really I don't think there is a cure but to try and relax and think of something that makes you happy. Keep your mind occupied by looking up baby items, clothing, health tips, etc.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i have an anxiety disorder as well i know how hard it is not to worry. every little thing looks ten times worse to you.  i went off my meds when i got pregnant to. i worried constantly i even had some bleeding and cramping during my first trimester and everything ended up fine. my son was born 9lbs 8 ounces only about 3 days early by c-section.  it sounds like your little ones doing fine. try (i say try cause i know its hard) to relax. do anything you can to stay calm. for me if i got stressed i would listen to music i loved and sing at the top of my lungs or read and if i got to the point of near anxiety attack i would go outside and walk. get some fresh air. try and do something like take a bubble bath or watch a chick flick. focus on keeping distracted and relaxed. if it gets to be to much i'd think of going back on the med because the meds will do less harm then extreme stress will.  I'm 10 weeks right now and kinda freaked out because my second appointment isn;t until like march third. good luck sweety! keep us updated!|`|oN9UNGZfaa	I have really bad anxiety and am not taking anything for it now and it's keeping me awake at night I try just to breath and take a hot shower I can't say it helps 100% but when I get panic attacks I try the breathing it gets me threw it Preying for you and I hate hearing about a m/c after hearing a heartbeat I was starting to think I was in the clear even with the bleeding anxiety really sucks
FS9fBgyXaa	I'm in the same position as you. Same routine, only my little one is 6.5 months though.<br>  I have decided that we will rock him to sleep as long as he wants/needs us to. One day he'll won't want us to anymore and if I stop before he's ready I will feel guilty (I refuse to let my baby cry himself to sleep!!) and I already know that at some point I will long for the days where I got to hold his precious little body in my arms and let him fall asleep so close to my heart and I think I'll feel that that day came way too quick :)<br>  <br>  Just enjoy it, don't do things different than what your heart tells you to, because you're 'supposed to' let your baby fall asleep alone.

If she has a fit, then go into the bedroom, don't pick her up, and rub her head or belly for a few minutes.

Both my sons have a bath and get changed together, my older son loves looking after the youngest, helping me helping him into his sleep-suit. When they're dressed my partner comes up and reads a story as I breastfeed my youngest. My oldest usually falls asleep in bed, we tuck him up. But we have to take my youngest away to settle down before we put him in his crib as he'd scream blue murder if it was just breast then bed... He's such a little attention seeker! |`|Nf2bPgxQaa	My baby fell asleep on her own since birth. I just put her into the bassinet or the crib and she fell asleep. <br>  <br>  I think it all depends on a baby. There are babies that will cry until you pick them up and rock them to sleep and then there are those who are fine falling asleep on their own. It has nothing to do w/ what you do. She'll either be fine w/ falling asleep on her own or not. As simple as that.|`|z0RFB5sbaa	its really good that she actually goes to sleep... but it may take a little for her to go to bed by herself... maybe you should lay down on the floor or bed next to her until she falls asleep.

But ever since i did that (my mom made me, she said that if i didn't do that, that she wasn't going to watch her over night for me) it helped out a lot|`|UiUSsfuYaa	For the first 9 months I nursed my daughter to sleep in my bed, then transferred her to her crib. I got her attached to a silk blankie when she was very young so that she had a comfort item to depend on besides me. She also sucked her thumb from day 1, so I never had much trouble getting her to take regular naps. After nine months I started training her to go to sleep at night without nursing, which was grueling for me. Her daddy and I would take turns singing to her and/or pacing with her until she stopped crying and would lie down to sleep, and sometimes we would have no choice but to let her cry, but only for short durations. After around 2 months, it finally happened that she was sleeping through the night, with only the occasional wake-up. <br>  <br>  You can try just going with your gut instinct and winging it, or try following a plan from a book.

Member since: <br>  June 15, 2007 <br>  Total points: <br>  552 (Level 2) Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  barring that this is a sudden change in behavior (in that case he might be sick, ie. earache, tummy problems...) you might need to break him of it. It was the hardest thing I ever did!! I had to let my daughter cry it out. (once it broke my heart so much I had to go take a drive and leave her home with my hubby) It's not easy, but it was the best thing ever in the end. It took like two or three nights of it and then it started to tapper off with good nights and bad nights, but eventually she began to go down quietly and stay down!! All in all, it took about a week and a half and she was on a good schedule. You have to stick it out though. If you break and go in that only tells the baby that if they scream that long then you'll come in and pick them up. (of course quietly peer in if you think there is a problem, but if they see you and there is nothing wrong... you'll have to start all over again!)

upINlSfnaa	Sorry honey, but not very many are wrong... I had one at 15 weeks and my doc said he was pretty sure it was a boy just went back at 26 weeks and he clearly showed me.. it is a boy. I was hoping for a girl too as I already have one boy. Oh well boys are great too... lol... I don't know if I want to try for a girl, and end up with 3 boys and a husband... I will go nuts lol. Best wishes and I hope they were wrong.|`|pSgk3TClaa	Me personally no but my friend was suppose to have a boy and ended up having a girl but Im not sure what week her ultrasound was. That is really early to predict the sex. I had a 13 week ultrasound when I was pregnant and they told me that was too early to tell and I had to wait until 20 wks. My mom was also told my sis was going to be a boy they mistake the umbilical cord but that was a long time ago.|`|8K2BfvC5aa	It is more likely that she said it was a girl and you have a boy then making a mistake saying that you have a boy and is indeed a girl.<br>  <br>  Just think this way... you will love your child no matter what. <br>  <br>  I am 22 weeks pregnant and I just found out that I am having a girl and I wanted another boy so bad!!!!

That is nothing wrong with that. |`|FpArsFcJaa	If you both saw it, it's probably what you think.<br>  <br>  I was told boy and had a girl.<br>  My friend was told girl and had a boy.<br>  <br>  Do another ultrasound at 20 weeks and you should know for sure.|`|qg7eu7tAaa	12 weeks to me seems to early to tell the gender.  but my cousin was told that she was going to have a boy and it turned out to be a girl. i had mines at 17 weeks and they said i was going to have a boy, at first i was a lil upset because i really wanted a girl. but once i saw how different it would be to raise a boy i was all to happy... if i was to have a girl and she was to be like me i think i may have killed her.(lol j/k) so im hoping he comes out a boy.but count your blessings...1)your pregnant 2)everything seems to be healthy....so good luck but to be sure go back and see because you might end up having your lil girl|`|36a7a8863eef1ee46758f389f9b14240aa	not me, but a close friend was told she was having a boy. she decorated the nursery and bought everything blue, picked a name (it was going to be gabriel) and then, at the delivery room the baby came out and she was like whattt???????? it's a girl??????? lol she ended up naming her eduarda. good thing is that a girl can wear blue clothes, if it had been the other way around it would be hard to convince her boyfriend that the boy would need to wear pink. hahaha good luck to you!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I was 16 weeks when the doctor pointed out the penis to me.  At the very end of the ultra sound he moved the little gizmo around and this little penis got like 5 inches long.  I nearly had a heart attack!

I would not rely on it until you are closer to 20 weeks|`|7eca1659cf99ecb24851b672dae1f755aa	It did not happen to me personally, but I have 2 stories of people that it did happen to.  Firstly, my cousin.  She lost her first child so  she was considered high risk and they did ultrasounds every month.  They told her it was a boy the whole time.  We planned the baby shower for 2 weeks before her c-section.  I got a call from her 2 days before the shower that she was having a girl, and sure enough, she had a beautiful daughter.  The second person was just a person I know but it is the opposite.  She was told the entire time that she was having a girl.  She was excited and with every ultrasound she was told that it was a girl.  She took all these frilly dresses and pink sleepers to the hospital when she went to have the baby.  She called us in tears because she had a boy and had nothing for him to wear but little girl stuff.  My doctor told me when I was pregnant that you can't really tell at 12 weeks.  They didn't tell me the sex of my son until my 20 week ultrasound.  I hope that you will be happy with a normal healthy baby no matter what the sex is.

At first I still got up with him, held him and rocked him without nursing and he went back to sleep.  The next night I just went in and kissed him and rubbed/patted his back and he went back to sleep, I ended up patting him for three nights, and the fifth night I waited, he let out one little cry and put himself back to sleep, he slept for 12 hours, he's 9 months old.<br>  <br>  I think it just takes time, and patience, as you said you know your son.<br>  <br>  Also, have a good bedtime routine, and give him formula/breastmilk just before bed.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can't.<br>  <br>  Babies develop the ability to sleep through the night at different ages, there is no way to force them anymore than you can force them to walk before they are ready.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/sleepstudies.html" rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/slee...</a><br>  Armstrong KL, Quinn RA & Dadds MR. The sleep patterns of normal children.<br>  Medical Journal of Australia 1994 Aug 1;161(3):202-6.<br>  <br>  The above study is the definitive work on sleeping habits of (Australian) children to 38 months. The researchers surveyed 3269 parents, with a 96.5% response rate, over a one week period. The parents had to report on their child's sleeping habits over the past 24 hours, plus answer a few questions related to their perceptions of their child's sleep behavior.<br>  <br>  What did they find?<br>  <br>      * There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behavior.<br>      * Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age.<br>      * Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age, the most marked reduction in length occurs around 3 months of age. However, a surprising 11% under 3 months of age don't have a daytime sleep every day.<br>      * Frequent night waking that disturbs parents is common from 4-12 months (12.7% disturb their parents 3 or more times every night).<br>      * Night time settling requires more parental input from 18 months.<br>      * Nearly a third of parents have a significant problem with their child's sleep behavior.<br>      * Sleeping through the night: 71.4% did this on at least one occasion by 3 months of age, but many of these relapse into more frequent waking in the 4 to 12 month period. It is not until after 24 months that regular night waking (requiring attention) becomes much less common.<br>  <br>  Although this study did not address breastfeeding, it is relevant because a lack of understanding of "normal" sleep patterns can lead to supplementing, early solids, belief there is not enough milk, etc. The authors claim it also leads to misdiagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and overuse of sedative medication. A worrying 31% of 25-38 month-old children were disciplined (mostly smacking) to get them to settle. 27% of parents let their children cry, 11% at less than one month.<br>  <br>   <br>  Scher A. A longitudinal study of night waking in the first year.<br>  Child Care Health Dev 1991 Sep-Oct;17(5):295-302.<br>  <br>  Abstract: A longitudinal study of the development of sleep patterns addressed the issue of continuity and change in night waking in the course of the first year. Mothers of 118 infants, who took part in a follow-up study of normal babies, completed a sleep questionnaire at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Regular night waking was a common characteristic throughout the first year:<br>  Baby's age<br>   <br>  % babies waking at night<br>  3 months<br>   <br>  46%<br>  6 months<br>   <br>  39%<br>  9 months<br>   <br>  58%<br>  12 months<br>   <br>  55%<br>  <br>  The number of awakenings per night was a function of age. Following a decline in the number of interruptions from 3 to 6 months, an increase in night waking at age 9 months was recorded. Although the methodology does not lend itself to an objective validation of the changes in sleep-wake states, nor is it suitable for causal explanations, it is, nevertheless, important to note this profile. The increase in night waking towards the end of the first year coincides with significant socio-emotional advances which characterize this developmental stage.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp</a><br>  NIGHTTIME PARENTING LESSON #4:<br>  An important fact for you to remember is that your baby's sleep habits are more a reflection of your baby's temperament rather than your style of nighttime parenting. And keep in mind that other parents usually exaggerate how long their baby sleeps, as if this were a badge of good parenting, which it isn't. It's not your fault baby wakes up.<br>  <br>  8. Babies still wake up. When babies mature into these adult-like sleep patterns varies among babies. Yet, even though babies achieve this sleep maturity some time during the last half of the first year, many still wake up. The reason? Painful stimuli, such as colds and teething pain, become more frequent. Major developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, and walking, drive babies to "practice" their new developmental skills in their sleep. Then between one and two years of age, when baby begins to sleep through the above-mentioned wake-up stimuli, other causes of nightwaking occur, such as separation anxiety and nightmares.<br>  <br>  Even though you understand why babies are prone to nightwaking, you realize it's still important for parents and babies to get a restful night's sleep, otherwise, baby, the parents, and their relationship won't thrive. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sleep%20stuff.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sle...</a><br>  How come my friend's baby sleeps through the night?<br>  <br>  I don't know.  I don't even know what that means. When I ask about what that means, I get a great variety of answers.  Some people think 6 hours of sleep at night is "through the night" other people want to sleep like they did before they had kids.<br>  <br>  I would guess that the kids aren't sleeping through the night, but that the implications of admitting that your kid isn't sleeping are too nasty to admit.  We equate "good sleepers" with good kids, and "bad sleepers" with bad kids.  Really, we make moral implications from normal baby behaviors. And of course, parents of good sleepers are good parents.  And since 80% of us have kids with "sleep problems," 80% of us are bad parents.

Probably the only exception to this would be an emergency involving a nursing mom's health. There are many suggestions in books and magazines for pushing "sleeping through the night" during a baby's early months or during the first year. I don't think this is the best thing to do and I am quite sure that the earlier a baby gets "non-response" from parents, the more likely he is to close down at least a little.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0071381392.php?nid=386&isbn=0071381392" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0...</a><br>  You can sleep, too<br>  <br>  There are no good reasons for you to live as a sleep-deprived martyr. There are ways to get your baby to sleep without resorting to all-night cry-a-thons.<br>  <br>  In summary, I don't believe babies should be left alone to cry themselves to sleep. Or even left to cry as you pop in every 10 minutes to murmur comforting words without reaching out to touch him.

I would argue that a several month old child is still not able to feed themselves, find food, or do any other thing that it would take to live independently.  Why on Earth would they need to soothe themselves?  They are speaking up because they need something.  If they need something, even if it just to feel safe, why shouldn't we help them? Do we really need to teach a 2 month old independence?  Why should they do it by themselves?   Because we want to sleep...I understand that... but sometimes our needs aren't what our kids are considering.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html/night_waking.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html...</a><br>  Night Waking: or, Will I Ever Get A Good Night’s Sleep Again?<br>  <br>  The answer is “no”. Once you become a mother, you will never, ever sleep the way you did before you had your baby. Even when he starts sleeping through the night, which will happen eventually (I promise), you will always have your mom radar on and will be listening for a cry in the night. Even if he is a teenager out on a date, you will lie in bed waiting for his car to pull in the driveway before you can fall asleep. When he is middle aged and balding, you will still worry about whether he is taking care of himself the way he should.  The question “When will my baby start sleeping through the night?’ is one that I dread the most. Like most health professionals, I like questions that have easy answers, and this one doesn’t. I do have opinions about how to handle sleep problems, based on my experience with nursing six children, and over twenty years of working with new mothers. What I don’t have is a quick fix, or a magic solution for you that will make your baby sleep through the night.<br>  <br>  ‘Experts’ can’t even agree on what sleeping through the night means. Some define a five- hour stretch as sleeping all night, others define it as an eight to twelve hour stretch. Sleep problems are a hot topic. There are dozens of books and hundreds of magazine articles on how to get your baby to sleep longer. In our culture, a ‘good’ baby is defined as one who sleeps a lot and demands as little attention as possible. If you define sleep problems the way many experts do, then almost all babies have some sort of sleep problem.|`|s7FBDZpbaa	cut out the nap at 3.. and just play with em more to wear him out an hour before bed than a nice hot bath|`|EeGgovyCaa	Becca is not being a smart azz, she's telling it like it it.

If you get up in the middle of the night to use the rest room, use that time to put a fresh diaper on him and fill his bottle or sippy cup with leukwarm water (to wash off the sugar from the juice and prevent tooth decay). He will be back to sleep before you put him back down and then you can climb back in bed without any distractions..Works for me everynight..My daughter just turned one this month and she sleeps until 10 am every morning..|`|KAhQJY5naa	Try putting him to bed earlier rather than later.

You had a kid, deal with it, it happens to the best of us. And stop keeping him up, if he is tried let him sleep.|`|ADEDkCgOaa	i have twins that are 11 months old and they dont sleep threw the night. you cant make them sleep. i put a full bottle in thier beds so that when they wake up its right there for them and that seems to make it easier.|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	some baby's do that my child got up till she was about 16 months old every few hours at night try to cut down the sleeping during the day and make sure all is quiet at night in his room|`|GJgZVKvXaa	Babies will follow whatever sleep schedule they want unless you take steps to train them to do something different.  You can teach your son to sleep all night using sleep training methods.  It will not happen overnight, but if you choose a technique and commit to it for at least 2 weeks straight, you will likely see some results. <br>  <br>  Sleep training techniques teach a baby to soothe himself back to sleep at night when he wakes.  Nobody sleeps the whole night through, the body goes through patterns of deep sleep followed by light sleep and waking.  Adults have learned not to notice these wakenings and just go back down to deeper sleep.  Some babies learn this on their own, others need some help to start doing it.<br>  <br>  Here is a good website with lots of info about different ways to sleep train:<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-training-the-basics_1505715.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-t...</a><br>  <br>  You will have to ask yourself whether you are willing to let your baby cry at night during sleep training.  Some methods call for you to let your baby cry for short periods before going to him.  This is to teach him to fall asleep on his own, without you rocking him/ holding him/ feeding him.  You can control how long you will allow your baby to cry, or you can try a "no cry" method if you don't want your baby to cry at all.<br>  <br>  Sleep training can be controversial so you should read as much unbiased information about it as you can before making up your mind.
f6qbRAmvaa	i could be ur ligaments stretching and it could also be bh good luck and congrats:)|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	if your concerned please call your doctor|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I just called my doctor yesterday because I've been having cramping and pains for the last three days or so.  He said it's round ligament pain from everything stretching and from the growing weight of the uterus.  Also, he told me that if I am not regular than I should have Metamucil everyday.  If you are constipated (like me), it could cause some cramping.  If the cramping doesn't stop after you have a bottle of water and lay on your left side for 10-15 minutes or so, you may want to call your doctor just for peace of mind.  Good luck!|`|3CG3rby0aa	no it sounds like braxton hicks.  You have them through most of your pregnancy but don't notice them till you get farther along.  Just get used to it cause they happen for the rest of pregnancy.  As long as they do not get regular then you will be fine.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	It's probably round ligament pain... when they stretch. i got that all the time, right in my groin by my hips and in my lower lower stomach. it's no fun, but it doesn't sound like anything abnormal for you.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	its probably just everything stretching.|`|IfKTQME0aa	I remember round ligament pain coming on suddenly like when rolling over in bed or moving around and it was more of a sharp pain rather than cramping.  If you are having cramping it is certainly worth seeing your doctor as soon as possible to have things checked out.  It is probably nothing but you can't ever be too safe when you are pregnant.  If they get worse you could see if there is a women's center in your town where they could check you any time of day.|`|fdfbb3fed9f6fe854aebbc3c863b7bb5aa	You should call your Dr, but from my experience, I had to have my appendix removed when I was 16 weeks pregnant.  All my Drs said that appendix problems are very common in pregnancy or after birth for some reason.  You could look into the signs of a swollen appendix and stuff just to be sure that is not it.  If I had not had mine removed, it would have ruptured and killed me and the baby.|`|fTd509Qzaa	it's your uterus stretching.  The pressure strains your round ligaments, that is what is hurting you.  I had some really bad pains with my first son, I was on the floor in pain.  Not so much this time around.  Google round ligament pains and you will get more info|`|eGfAXaV3aa	oh yeah had that...its likely to be your body stretching to allow baby to grow bigger...as long as there is no bleeding...you shouldn't be worried. just wait until the baby drops and it feels like a bowling ball in between your legs! Fun times! :)

s4LWmcTjaa	Oh girl I feel the pain!  :-)<br>  <br>  My skin on my tummy is pretty stretched out and saggy.  Like you, I know the end result was well worth it,  but also like you I just want my stomach to appear normal again.  A lot of the women here are right about it getting better with time.  Once my son was about 18 months old it was much more tone and firm like it was pre-baby.  It will never be perfect again unless I have a tummy tuck, but even then it would not be natural.<br>  <br>  Palmers Cocoa butter and stretch mark creams do help reduce the saggines and stretch marks.  I have been using those thing since day one of my journey into motherhood and pregnancy.  It will tone up some over time though.<br>  <br>  I know I'll probably get a few thumbs down for saying this, but I look at my stomach as proud marks of mommy-hood.  Are there days when I look at my stomach and want to cry after seeing Heidi Klume with a perfect stomach 2 months post partum?  YOU BET.  But my husband reminds me that those stretch marks and saggy skin are permanent reminders of the three miracles I carried inside of me (one miracle I will never meet on this side of heaven).  <br>  <br>  I long for a pretty tone stomach, but realize that having the stomach I do have is a small price to pay for the beautiful kids I have in my life.  That and my husband still finds me attractive :)  That certainly helps.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	The muscles that hold all of that in are stretched right now.  Over time they will tighten back up with a little help from you and some crunches.  I can not guarantee that they will be the way they were prepregnancy but, they won't stay all saggy like that forever.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Mine went away after 2 years when I did pilates, but some peoples never does go away. It all depends on your skins elasticity and if your body has poor elasticity then the only option would be surgery.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	there is nothing u can do, to be blunt. once that skin stretches out like that, you can't pop it back into place. sorry, babies are great, the rest sucks.|`|heDtLdz5aa	yeah me too...my so is 16 months tommorow and i had a c-section and i still have a very flabby tummy..  : (|`|s7FBDZpbaa	we all do!|`|e5CuEiPfaa	I know exactly what you mean. I would do it over again, but I do hate the excess skin! I am seriously thinking after I have my last child (trying to convince hubby right now to start trying for a last child!) that I may check into a tummy tuck. Yeah I know that it costs money, but it is so hard to find clothes that fits right! That would be the main reason I done it, is for the clothes reason. I hate shopping bc nothing ever fits me bc of my saggy belly! <br>  I have read a lot on exercising the lower tummy, and maybe if you google lower stomach exercises it will help you, but personally I have had no luck! Maybe you will, though!|`|bc9inzicaa	I'm in the same boat! Love my baby and would go through it all over again, but i do not like the saggy skin one bit!<br>  <br>  Cross our fingers and hope there is a mommy out there who has a secret to get rid of the sag without invasive surgery!|`|dqSA7j7gaa	there isnt much you can do unless you hit the gym hard and tighten the muscles up again. I was told my muscles should tighten up but it has been 3 months and NOTHING!<br>  Its a MOMMY POUCH! <br>  I hate mine~|`|ADEDkCgOaa	your skin is still stretched out. do stomach exercises and go jog. it will help tighten things back up.|`|6A954Ptdaa	Try toning up your stomach by regular excecise this could include sit ups :) hope this helps
n6XYYyoLaa	i am lucky i guess; mine has always slept through the night, but i am a heavier sleeper than hub, so he hears all the whimpers and scurrying around while she sleeps...|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i get up when i hear him cry sometimes its so hard and im so i tired..|`|iOSEVRPPaa	He may have been getting you up 8 times because you came so quickly.  I don't believe in letting them cry it out that young, but you may have let him make some noise a little longer.<br>  <br>  I have often had instances where our baby started, but I waited to see if he could soothe himself back to sleep, and he did.  I never let it go to all out crying, but I don't jump at every whimper or sound.<br>  <br>  My baby has been getting me up only once at night since about 2.5 months.  And has even slept through 4 or 5 times.|`|AA11756768	I don't wake up right away, it takes me a minute or so. I have a cosleeper attached to the bed so I usually pick up my son while he is still laying down and it takes me another minute to get up. If I woke up for every little wimper I would be up twice as much, he sometimes wimpers in his sleep for a few seconds and I see no reason to wake him up if he isn't waking up himself.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I wake up quickly at the first grunt, but I don't get up until I know that my son is waking up.  I don't want to disrupt his sleep by tending to him when he is just going through is regular "sleep" and is just making noise.|`|DDFSITiYaa	As each child is born, your reaction time slows.  You realize the earth does not stop turning with the first whimper or cry.  When I had #3, there were many times I just could not get to him right away, be it during the day or the night.  So he learned to go back to sleep relatively easily and quickly.  He is now almost 2 and when he wakes in the morning with his first noises, I always let him go for at least another half hour.  He usually dozes back off for a bit and he never cries  - he just talks and amuses himself until I come get him.  <br>  <br>  I think by slowing your response, you are actually doing him a favor by encouraging him to settle himself. <br>  <br>  PS THat's great he is down to 1x a night!|`|NGAZSqn2aa	My daught is almost 6 months old and I dont get up with her unless she is crying or if she is wide awake. Getting up is always hard for me but I know its only going to be for about 20 minutes then I get to go back to sleep. She usually wakes up between 6-7am. I feed her and change her and it takes me about 20 minutes, then she usually goes right back to sleep untill like 8-9am. She makes alot of noises and whines and moves alot in the night but I dont usualy get up unless she is fully awake or crying.|`|24f969b02a5ea25351be932405126b28aa	with both of my kids i waited for them to cry and made sure it was a cry because they liked to whimper so i would pick them up. you have a hard time getting up like i do because we are just exhausted. Dont worry, my grandpa always said a little crying wont hurt.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i never got up with my baby unless she started to cry.  a lot of times if she was just wimpering or making noises, she would go right back to sleep.  moms need as much sleep as possible!!!|`|A0NQyFmnaa	don't torture yourself with this thought...babies are full time job may be a couple of jobs together....and after a day full of it...its natural to be tired at night...<br>  the fact that you are worried about this situations, tells that you are a very caring mother...<br>  <br>  2.5 months is old enough age for your baby to he could start stretching out those hours to 6 or even 8 at night. you said he gets up only once now...which is a good start<br>  <br>  its very important for your baby to have healthy sleeping habits and you can be a key person in doing so...you can also get help from your partner or other family member for that "one" night time feeding till your little one gets into this sleeping habit...<br>  <br>  this way you also get your part of rest..remember your baby needs a well rested mom :) <br>  <br>  read this<br>  <a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/sleep/habitsbyage0to3months/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/sleep/h...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  god bless you and your baby
ECPdAeHQaa	Oh my gosh me too! The dreams feel so real but I don't see my husband ever actually doing them. I tell him when I get up and feel like he should apologize. <br>  Last night, I had a dream that him and another girl were making out with this piece of pizza. I know, very bizarre. I got really upset and told them they might as well make out with each other and my husband said well at least she can eat pizza.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lol, I know it's funny but I woke up very angry. I haven't been able to stomache pizza my whole pregnancy. I used to LOVE pizza!|`|AA10953561	I had a similar dream early on in my pregnancy. I dreamt that my baby had already been born and it was our first night out since the baby was born and we got separated at this party and the next thing I know someone is telling me that he's in bed with the biggest sl*t I know. <br>  <br>  Personally, I think my dream (and possibly yours) stemmed from worrying about my changing body and whether the attraction he felt for me would last throughout the pregnancy and after. It's only natural to worry about these things.<br>  <br>  Of course, hormones play a big part in having more vivid dreams and dreams that are extreme situations. Talk to your husband and just tell him that you're feeling a little insecure and would like a romantic night for the two of you. That's what worked for me.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wQucJZRCaa	Yes, just hormones! I had a very similar dream when I was about 20 weeks. My dream was that my husband was having an affair with a very beautiful actress and they had a child together! It threw me off for a couple of days trying to get it through my head that it was just a dream, but it is hard to get rid of thoughts that we don't like! <br>  <br>  The strong thoughts of the dream will go away in a couple of days or so, no worries!
v3LnJycKaa	OH GOD MY MIL IS THE SAME WAY!!!! My mom loves babies and loves the fact I keep spitting them out... my mil on the other hand was over on xmas eve, which was already enough for me... and i was talking to nana about how big my youngest is getting and it always so sad to see them grow up, and my mother in law says, well you just spit them out every 5 minutes any way.... for some back ground, she is never been married, 3 kids by three different fathers, none of which are around, my husband was told another man was his dad until he was 5, even had the mans name first and last, and it was changed to a completely different name at age 5, she has mooched off the system her entire life, and my hubby is 25 and his sister is 7... HELLO i yelled at my husband he says she is mad because she wont be getting any attention and if she could she would have another just for the attention (ps also lost custody of her youngest to the daddy) but has the audacity to say something to me about my decisions as a grown married working member of society who has never used or abused any offerings of the state... <br>  <br>  ugh people like that make me so angry. there really isnt away, then she went so far as to call my husband and say "you should tell Kim to have an abortion... " my husband said are you stupid, she is 5 months pregnant and we want our children... ok so i have somehow turned your post into all about me.. sorry... :) <br>  <br>  I would call her and be as happy as can be when you tell her you are preggo she may not like it right away but she will get over it and love her grandbaby, cant change these peoples minds about anything... be happy for you and your family and let her figure out how she wants to deal with it on her own dont let her bring you down.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i would have smacked her in her face! thats how i would have delt with her. that was completely rude and uncalled for. i know she didn't know you were pregnant, but still.|`|ECPdAeHQaa	Yes sounds like she doesn't have a filter on her mouth that most people have. Things just blurt out even if they are rude. <br>  <br>  People like that though are not very considerate and you should just not let it bother you. You know you are very well capable to take care of another child and that's all the matters.|`|MFsuN8Doaa	My great grandmother did that to me. I just pointed out that I was more than mature enough to have a baby. 'I'm pregnant, what's your excuse,' was my reply to a couple of my larger friends when I got that question|`|yyIVrngcaa	ignore her, or tell her, "yes I am, now please quit making comments, I don't care for what you think, it's my life remember?|`|21LiTNVsaa	yea that sux, you should have just said actually i am, what is wrong with that!!?!?|`|dWwszt5Yaa	well unless she supports your kids i dont see her problem.. just be a woman and tell her you are pregnant.. she has to deal with it eventually
AqThQCzzaa	I'm so sorry for your loss.  I understand how difficult this is for the two of you.  <br>  <br>  What were your wife's hcg levels after the miscarriage?  I believe it takes levels of atleast 25 to get a positive pregnancy test, so if her levels were below 5 before there's a good chance the tests are correct.<br>  <br>  I've had 4 miscarriages so I know a bit about this.  I'm guessing your wife didn't have a period after the miscarriage?  If not this is what I did with my current pregnancy:  I was so tired of the waiting for appointments and ultrasounds and using progesterone that when I found out I was pg this time I called the dr and told them I wanted blood work.  Whey they asked if I wanted an appt. I told them I only wanted the blood work and once the results were in only then would I consider seeing a dr.  I knew I could get the blood work that day and have the results the next.  When the results came back the next day they called with my numbers, which were thankfully high, and let me know the dr wanted to see me the next day for an appt. and another round of bloodwork (your wife's hcg levels should be doubling at this point). <br>  <br>  As for the ultrasound, yes you'd be able to see your little one at this point, however the baby's heart doesn't start beating until sometime in the 6th week.  I had an ultrasound with this baby at 6 1/2 weeks and we could see his heart beating and he was developing as he should have at this point.<br>  <br>  I give you tons of credit for trying to understand everything.  Your wife is a lucky woman!!<br>  <br>  Best wishes to the both of you!|`|HSUfe3m7aa	The HCG will be gone from your wife's miscarriage by now. Sorry for your loss by the way.<br>  <br>  A transvaginal ultrasound would be able to see a fetal pole around 4 weeks. This type of ultrasound is where a wand is inserted in the vagina. The bloodwork will measure the HCG, and then again 2 days later to make sure they numbers are rising the way they should be.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and best of luck.|`|46PSDx1raa	If you explain to the doctor about the miscarriage then most likely when you go to the appointment next week they will do an ultrasound just to check if there is in fact a fetus and it is not just the hormones. I'm pretty sure that they can tell when they do the blood test whether its a new pregnancy or not but they may do it for a peace of mind.|`|z26vZUJVaa	After a miscarriage the HCG level ususally goes down after about 1 week, so it should be picking up a new pregnancy. All you will see in the 1st ultrasound is a lil dot which will be the sac. Good luck.|`|96HWpdkFaa	At 4 weeks I don't think they would really beable to see anything. Maybe just a sac. Usually you can't see the baby till 6 weeks. Sometimes not even then.<br>  <br>  It could possibly still be from the misscarige...those hormones don't go down right when you misscarige...they stay in your system a bit. But you will find out soon enough. <br>  =)<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Chances are that this is a new pregnancy.  This far along after a miscarriage your hormones would have returned to normal, so it is definitely a new pregnancy.  An early sonogram will be very accurate in determining how far along she is, and at 4 weeks they will be able to see the baby, but it won't look too exciting yet- it will just look like a spec.   I'm sorry for your loss.  I hope everything is ok this time around!
Axcy1DYlaa	March 31st and feeling exactly how you feel! I am so ready to have him! I'm just not swollen at all. Havent had swelling of any sort throughout this pregnancy.

cZZUjVkqaa	No, see, in America it is only mutilation if circumcision is being done to a girl. Then it is a horrid and heinous offense and punishable. But when done to a defenseless male newborn it is perfectly acceptable. <br>  <br>  *Shakes head*|`|Q7jMH5praa	May I ask you a question? Why do you have to continually ask the same question when you know you are going to get responses that you don't like? <br>  <br>  Circumcision is a choice for the parents of a little boy to decide. I really don't think that it is mutilation or barbaric. <br>  <br>  My husband and I decided to get our son circumcised because my husband's grandfather suffered from penile cancer. The doctors told my husband's grandfather that if he had been circumcised his chances of developing the cancer would have been reduced. Now I know that penile cancer is very rare but since it does run in the family we decided to err on the side of caution and have our son circumcised. I feel that we made the best decision, and I have no regrets.<br>  <br>  Edit to add links:  <br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/system/surgical/circumcision.html." rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/system/surg...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.urologychannel.com/circumcision/benefits.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.urologychannel.com/circumcisi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aap.org/publiced/BR_Circumcision.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aap.org/publiced/BR_Circumcis...</a>|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	"if you disagree, i would like to hear why, and would also like your source for your info."<br>  <br>  Where is the source for your info?

From country to country a teenage boy always wants to be "normal". That "normal" may change from country to country but as long as people aren't ACTUALLY hurt their is nothing wrong with it.|`|IjcdwJiMaa	the 4skin has nothing to do with sexual pleasure, its there to help protect the head of the penis. as for getting it done it makes it easier for a male to clean himself, (not that it cant be done if hes not done), i got my son done for that reason, also the way that most r done they don't take as much skin off so that it can be there for protection of the head, that is the way my son had his done...but id also wanna know why u think that its a big issue, u don't have 2 get ur child done if u feel that way, but just like u ever1 has there own opinion|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Why would I give my opinion to someone who is obviously close minded to begin with.

Experts disagree, and so do parents. So in the meantime, parents continue to make that choice based on religion, their feelings on cleanliness, and a whole host of other issues. When it's time for you to have your son, you can make that choice, too. <br>  <br>  Mutilation is an awfully strong word to use, by the way. That implies that they perhaps remove the foreskin in a way that could rip everything off, not a controlled cut with a scalpel at the hands of a professional. In the hospital where my child is being born, and countless other hospitals around the country, they use anesthesia to remove it.

The thing with that is only 1% to 2% of boys actually get a UTI in their life so the question is actually whether circumcision is necessary because they are so rare.<br>  Also, more boys present with a UTI right after they have been circumcised.<br>  They have also found that it does prevent the passing of HIV, but since this is not a prevelant disease in modern countries the question comes up of the circumcision being worth it for something rare.  In places like Africa it could help though.<br>  The study also states that circumcision can lower the risk of penile cancer.

hOWNwpCLaa	I took my pregnancy test the day of my missed period, and it was 100 percent correct.  I took a test 3 different times, just to be sure.  However, I've heard that if you take it before the day of your missed period, it's not very accurate.  Just wait a few more days, I know you're anxious, but it's really worth the wait to get a more accurate reading.|`|faPKwClPaa	I did.  I was two days before my period was due, and I took one of those digital (Pregnant/Not Pregnant) Clear Blue Easy tests and it came back as 'Pregnant' within, like 30 seconds. ;-)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UTCkWYl1aa	I took a prignancy test the week I was suposed to get my period and it came back nagitive about two weeks later i was getting sor breast and morning sickness and still no period so i tested again and it came back positive some times if you test too early your hormone level is not high enough to detect pregnancy. give it a little more time and then test again it sounds like you got a false result.|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	my doctor says never to test early, even the tests that say you can detect it early can give false results.  those could be pregnancy signs and also signs of your period starting ... happens to me all the time :)<br>  <br>  Good luck - Baby dust|`|3hQDfdwYaa	With my daughter i took a pregnancy test a week before my period was due and it came back positive but it was a very faint line on the test but it was accurate
b8f0CfSsaa	Amniotic fluid is oderless unlike urine and not thick unlike discharge.<br>  <br>  I have never tried them but I certainly will in future!
DutTBV3caa	i dont think its safe.. <br>  heres some info on it. <br>  <a href="http://www.tanning-advisor.com/pregnancy-and-tanning-beds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tanning-advisor.com/pregnancy...</a>|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	I wouldnt recommend it although my OB said it was ok. I didnt feel comfortable doing it. I tried the tan mist but I think due to my hormones, it ended up looking unnatural when I looked at my pics (i went to a wedding)... I think certain chemicals will react differently on your skin due to hormones and such.  But you can always just try the ones in the bottle... I use Loreal Sublime bronze and it is very good. It looks natural. Try it and you will see.   But as for tanning bed, I wouldnt recommend it.... I wouldnt risk it.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. Actually your supposed to avoid extremes while pregnant because your throwing off your homeostasis so much. I used to work in a tanning salon while I was in high school and we had strict rules against pregnant ladies tanning b/c of the risk of over-heating. I don't know what state you live in but most NYS tanning salons prohibit pregnant ladies from tanning. With all that being said I don't think that there is a huge chance something could go wrong but people just want to be safer than sorry u know?! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!<br>  <br>  ps...thankfully spring is right around the corner and we will be getting more sunny days!!|`|vigFmfLmaa	I've heard both that it's safe and unsafe.  I personally wouldn't do it.  Plus tanning during pregnancy is a bad idea in general because a lot of women experience such shifts in hormones that your skin will get dark and blotchy after exposure to UV rays.|`|enqtxuUVaa	hiya <br>  not sure about tanning don't know if there is any real evidence on wether its any worse for you while pregnant than not. The only thing i could think of is the pigments of your skin so you could end up with darker blotchy patches but the same goes if you go out in the sun. Don't think docs recommend it at all! as for the waxing iv been told that it dosent cause any harm while pregnant.|`|bCjmjnqgaa	where i live they dont allow pregnant women to tan. its a state law i believe<br>  im pretty sure they do it for overheating reasons <br>  im not sure if its totally safe. <br>  plus it might be hard for you to get in and out of the bed or for the bed to even close all the way - depending on the bed you use|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	My doc said no, as you can over heat yourself which can be harmful to your baby.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i don't think ur suppose to tan while pregnant.  I think u should call ur doc and ask them if its alright to tan while pregnant.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the bikini wax but the tanning needs to stop
ocNUYENRaa	I don't have first hand advice either, my son gave it up at 4 months. It was a shock! This is what my friend did with her daughter who was nearly 3. She told her a story before she went to bed about the "paci fairy". I guess in your case it would be the nunu fairy. Anyway, when children get bigger the nunu fairy comes for the nunus. You leave them out in a basket or however you choose for the nunu fairy - she takes them away to the babies who need them. As a thank you, nunu fairy leaves a gift. Sort of like the tooth fairy for pacifiers. The next night they set out the pacifiers and the fairy came for them and left a doll. The little girl was thrilled, and she was broken cold turkey of her pacifiers. I know it won't work with all kids, but it worked well with them.|`|a6IzhQfNaa	You are going to have to take it away from her if you want her to stop using a pacifier. You can try to ease her out of it by just letting her keep the binky for her nap and night-time. Other than that you may just have to hide it from her and try not to give in when she asks for it. I know there are other methods but this one really is the best. You assert your authority and she has to make changes and grow, realizing she isn't a little baby anymore. I have heard talk of people putting yucky tasting things on their child's pacifier but I honestly think that is kind of mean. Good luck!<br>  - Are you a blogging mom? Join Blogger Moms! on Yahoo! Groups|`|nJQr2oOcaa	cut the tip off! <br>  then leave it on the floor, she'll see it, try to use it, and realize its broken. she will  say to u, "fix it" but you say "im so sorry! it broke! it cant be fixed. do you think we should throw it out?" if they say no, its ok, just let her hold it for a day or so, she'll hold it in her hand while she sleeps, then after a few days just throw it out, she may still cry a night or 2, <br>  but its better then it just disappearing.with this, she sees its broken, and knows broken things get thrown out.<br>  <br>  but shes old enough to understand that if sdomething is broken, it cant be used <br>  <br>  also i read someone elses answer once and what they did was, they took it from her while she was sleeping so she would learn to feel what it was like to sleep without it, and that helped too.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|02m7xJ0xaa	DONT let her have it and hide it in a place where he will not find it and dont say the word when she is around just make her completely forget that it even exists!<br>  Hope it helps :-)|`|WmQzUqfEaa	You don't give it to her! Throw them all away and let her see you do it. Then you can't do anything to give one to her.|`|nZBtm3meaa	My daughter sucks her thumb, so I can't give first hand advice.  My friend did this when her kids were little and they never went back to the pacifier again.<br>  <br>  She would dip the pacifier in hot sauce when the kids weren't looking and when she gave it to them, it was obviously hot and they didn't like it.  When they brought their pacifiers to their mom, she said "oh bad pacifier" and then she would tell the kids she was going to throw the pacifier away because it hurt them.  <br>  <br>  Not sure what others think of this and again, my child sucks her thumb so this is the only story I know about taking the pacifier away from kids.
YiDhb60Paa	sound like to me that your baby picky. i'm also 11 weeks and i'm also 20 to and with my first baby. try to eat small meals and then go back for..|`|zPYyGw8oaa	I did the same thing but it was okay, in a couple of weeks the sickness should go away and you will be able to eat "real" food. make sure you are taking your vitamins daily and you'll be fine :)|`|0vpDDM8aaa	make sure you are taking a prenatal vitamin.  i take mine right before i crawl into bed...that way i can usually keep it down okay.  if you can do that, you know that the baby is getting the essential nutrients.  try some less junky foods...try some crackers, some cheese, maybe instead of ice cream try a little bowl of cool whip with some berries or other fruit on top?  also...sounds like you can handle sugar okay...try some cereal (with low sugar)....a lot of cereals have vitamins and minerals in them.  you can munch it dry if you cant handle milk.|`|5ZdB5K6Raa	Your still early into your pregnancy it will get better but slowly put down the punk food try fruits instead of candy, brownies and chips also try to eat smaller meals through out the day to see if that will help|`|RQcZd0p5aa	go to docture
C8E3fe3xaa	Yep, they are safe..but they have alot of sodium so try not to over do it. However a little extra sodium is way better than smoking, so enjoy!|`|wLBsgNKAaa	Congrats!  Sunflower seeds are a great source of vitamin E, which is an antioxidant and are awesome to curb cravings, especially food cravings.  They seem to be working for your purpose as well.  I commend you for stopping smoking.<br>  <br>  It appears you have found the perfect snack food and no, there are no adverse affects to you or the baby in consuming them.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  Nicole|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	Congratulations on quitting smoking!!  No I wouldn't see any problem with sunflower seeds.  Just watch your sodium intake that's all! Congrats again and best of luck!|`|sXCSVFBaaa	Why wouldn't they be ok?? I see no reasons.|`|xnhwmontaa	Yes they are fine better than smoking. you really should have stopped sooner but better than never now your baby can gain weight easier. pop as much as you please but make sure to drink extra water seeds can suck water from you even when i wasnt preg i would pee a lot if i ate a lot|`|R8bXuLbTaa	no, i would be more worried about the damage you may have done while you were smoking.
LPsogWKSaa	I have the same problem. I got the mamas & papas ultimate 8-in-1 because as its our 1st baby i wanted the traditional carrycot, big wheels etc. BIG mistake my LO is also already out of the carrycot, has been for a few weeks, but the seat unit is actually better because he seems more secure in it. The chassis is terrible, the brake doesn't work properly and it generally seems like it needs tightened up. I too are in the process of complaining to M&P.<br>  <br>  I want to get something more lightweight for the bus etc but like you my MIL bought it so it seems a bit ungrateful to be wanting a buggy after 5 1/2 months!
MR9iBgafaa	The movements do vary - my baby's now 4.5 months old and though she moved every day it varied from energetic kicks to the odd turn over.<br>  <br>  I even got so worried as she didn't move for a few hours and went into hospital - she was absolutely fine and this was at 40 weeks!<br>  <br>  As long as you feel the baby move every day you'll be fine.  If you do worry, drink a glass of ice cold water and lie on your side.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's perfectly normal this early to have this. You don't have to start counting fetal kicks until you are at 28 weeks. If this was happening after 28 weeks then you would want to see your Dr. but this early it's normal.|`|bql2RJzWaa	DO NOT WORRY! With my first, after many miscarriages, I was so happy to finally feel him moving. When he didn't move for a couple days, I really started to worry. <br>  Babies take 'breaks'. Yes, for a couple days at a time. I didn't feel my son moving for 3 days. Then, one day at work, I felt this sort of clicking feeling in me. Lower down. He had hiccups! Then, I could feel where he was & he was more 'in my body' area then im ny abdomen.<br>  Have a warm bath, splash water on tor belly & talk to your baby. I'm sure you'll feel something.<br>  And don't let yourself worry! It's normal;)<br>  Congrats!!|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I think it is normal. I am 27 weeks 6 days, and It hasn't been until the last couple of weeks that the baby started moving predictably. When I was around 20 weeks, I went about 3 days without feeling the regular movements. They said it was fine and normal, and they don't usually start having the mother count kicks until 28 weeks.<br>  Try drinking some really cold juice and eat a snack, then lay down. You should be able to feel 10 movements in an hour. even if they are tiny little kicks.<br>  I am sure you and your baby are fine! Congrats on the baby!|`|2l7lbcJWaa	1/2 week pregnant?|`|zmbeIbx7aa	Yes I worried about this a lot with my son. He wouldn't move all day long and then when my husband would come home from work would move like crazy and continue through the night. I actually went to the hospital twice because of fetal movements. Every time turned out fine. It is normal if they move in excess for them to rest in excess as long as you feel your baby move each day sometime throughout the day I am sure everything is fine. You could always do kick counts. You drink a glass of juice or something sugary and then lay on your left side and wait to feel the little one move. The normal is 10 kicks in an hour but my doctor said as long as I feel it move everything is okay. He also told me the more active I am on some days the baby gets tired to and needs more rest than what I need but if you ever feel like anything is wrong do not hesitate to go to the er it is better to go and nothing be wrong than not to go and something be wrong. I hope that everything is going better.|`|V80zYDAMaa	I have been feeling the same way!!! I am 23 and a few days too. He seems to kick so much on one day then not at all the next. It drives me crazy too!! Good question I am excited to see your answers!!
35irl04Paa	If this is your first pregnancy yes. Even if its not it is still normal. Every pregnancy is different. I am 34 weeks pregnant and have gained 20 lbs and cant gain anymore, my son is estimated at 7 1/2 plus. Then again my mom only gained 13 lbs with me and I was born 5 13. It all depends on your body and how much your baby is taking from you. If that makes any sense to you. Hope this helps.|`|GeMenejZaa	if the doctor is not concerned then it is perfectly fine. every woman is advised to gai a different amount depending on body type and weight before hand. they can also be off by about 2 lbs when estimating the weight of a baby still in the womb. as long as doctors are not concerned, id say its fine.|`|yKS2UI87aa	As long as the baby is full term usu anything over 6 lbs is fine. Lucky you with not as much weight to lose. (I gained 40 lbs) :(|`|bmWKETgWaa	It's within the normal range, especially if you're small yourself.  A few years ago doctors were overly strict with pregnant women, and tried to enforce weight gains of less that twenty pounds.  This was impossible for many perfectly healthy women, who were gaining 25 to 30 pounds.<br>  <br>  The placenta and cord weigh about a pound, the amniotic fluid about another pound, and the weight of the expanded uterus and surrounding tissues and skin several pounds more.  Much of the rest of the weight is fluid, which will automatically be lost in the weeks following delivery. <br>  <br>  If the amount of your weight gain is OK with your doctor, I'd say there's nothing to worry about.|`|MavosJHYaa	I gained 20 lbs. with my baby at 37 weeks she was estimated to be 6 lns 7 oz. She was born at 38 weeks and only weighed 6 lbs 3 oz. She was completely healthy, just a petite baby. It is totally OK. I was expected to have a much larger baby b/c I have diabetes, but she obviously stayed small. If you are only 9 months(36 weeks) and don't have the baby until you are at full 40 weeks. You could have a 7/5 lb baby. The estimation from the scan can be a half pound of in either direction. Like with mine, they were estimating that at 38 weeks had I had a scan she would have been about 7 lbs and she barely weighed over 6. As long as baby is growing and getting bigger it is fine.|`|fUvB4MGWaa	I gained 14 pounds, and my son was also estimated at 6.5lbs according to ultrasound. He was born 7lbs, 14oz, and I almost needed a c-section. Estimates are just that - estimates. My doctor thought he would be around 9lbs. As long as your baby is within a healthy range (which it is at 6.5lbs), everything is fine. Don't stress, you'll have a beautiful baby in no time!|`|zh2nuHVTaa	The normal size baby in us is 6.25lbs so yea you are average.
JOVWBOOCaa	I would go to the doctor! Sounds like you have an infection. Probably just a yeast infection or possibly BV (or worse) You definitely should be seen by a doctor! I would say you are definitley not pregnant though!|`|DxDfa3E7aa	...um, I would say that you're not pregnant, hun. You just had your period, so I would have thought that would have clued you in. Not that I'm saying you're stupid, but you're worrying yourself for nothing.|`|nkEEQtmEaa	You just had your period 7 days ago. You're probably not pregnant.|`|iPQqPkhTaa	god, i hope not because if you can't figure this one out, how the heck can you raise a kid?|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'd say your not pregnant. Don't worry about it...Just use a condom next time to be safe. <br>  =)|`|IjcdwJiMaa	its unlikely, but if it is bugging u a lot then take a test
HCmAoNjzaa	I took one last month but that was the first time I had in a LONG time. My periods are always right on time. I got so sick of seeing a BFN constantly that I just decided that I would wait until I was late. Last month I took one because I had A LOT of pregnancy symptoms but I wasn't pregnant. Clomid will fool you into thinking you are pregnant because the side effects are the same as pregnancy symptoms. I am addicted to OPK's though. I HAVE to test everyday!|`|DN6XtoViaa	you can start taking HPTs everyday starting 10 days past ovulation.<br>  OR if you want to go crazy then start as soon as 6 days past ovulation!<br>  <br>  i personaly wouldn't want to test until AFTER my period is late as<br>  i would hate to find out i miscarried!|`|nwHqblWiaa	last month i took 6 before my missed period! yeah-id say im obsessed with peeing on sticks! luckily i got the ones from www.early-pregnancy-tests.com for like .92 cents each... so i dont feel like im wasting so much money on tests. im out now though--need to restock! this time im thinking about buying the ovulation tests too...|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	when i had a huge amount from buying them online I think I was averaging about 10/month  lol<br>  <br>  now that I ran out, because I was doing 10/month I don't know my average as this is the first month.. and since I'm 18 days late!!  I've done more than what I'd do normally I think.. This month I've used 5 opk as pregnancy tests and then 4 hpt, one internet cheapie, two dollar store and one FREP, plus one more pee on a stick at the doctor's office..  and now a blood test..  lol<br>  <br>  Hopefully if I'm not pregnant I'll stick to 2-3/month with dollar store ones..|`|vJd22M9Baa	No you are not crazy.  I completely understand, going through the same.  I usually take one after 19 days of bd.  So if they are days of bd after another I will test every 2 weeks.  <br>  <br>  TTC is a hard job for some of us.  I have gone through so many hpt's and opk's. <br>  <br>  Keep trying, I am sure it will happen.|`|rTtIKOmpaa	when i was TTC just one. If it said negative I waited til the next month. And I always waited until I was for sure1 or 2 days late. I only had to try 2 months cause by the 3rd month I got a positive!|`|zif7kxswaa	oh, you are not crazy! i started testing..... um i'm embarrassed to actually admit it. but i would start testing as early as 6dpo. and i kept testing until AF showed!!!!  eventually all those BFN's were very hard to look at. so i stopped testing so early. but i have a short luteal phase. so even testing the day my period was due was too early. but i did!  when i did get pregnant this last time, I got my first positive at 11dpo. one day after my period was due. sadly it ended in miscarriage. and my doctor told me not to test until three weeks after AF is due!! which is completely crazy!|`|e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	I've limited myself to only taking an HPT at 21DPO, so well after AF is due.  This month I will take two, I just took one yesterday, BFN.  My cycles haven't been normal since stopping birth control so I've been having 42-45 day cycles the past 3 cycles.  This is making it hard for me to determine when I ovulate, there were two different days that I may have ovulated this month so I'm waiting another week and a half before testing again.  I'll either be 18DPO or 24DPO.|`|AA11025973	It depends. I have been TTC for over a year and if I'm having a lot of symptoms that I think might be pregnancy symptoms I usually end up taking like 4 or 5 before I get my period. Some months when I don't feel anything (or forget lol) I don't take any! Since we have been trying so long we avoid buying pregnancy test the day before my period is supposed to start because it gets really expensive.|`|YLXpwqceaa	HPT - probably around 3 a month.....<br>  <br>  Ovulation tests...different story.  I'm POAS addict, and I take 2 ovulation tests everyday for about 2 weeks to make sure I don't miss it.  My trash can is full of them! lol  And some days I even take 3...I'm obsessed.<br>  <br>  I buy from babyhopes.com or early-pregnancy-tests.com as they are less than a dollar per test.  I buy in bulk.|`|bKK2fPiVaa	Wow... it's great to know I am not alone in my obsessive peeing on a stick!  I take what I can afford each month :)  Last month was only two.  But this month I bought HPT's in bulk as well as ovulation tests!  Let's see how many I use this month!<br>  BABY DUST!|`|ce8COixxaa	I take one the day AF is due (if she's not here) and another about 7-10 days late... though I'd like to take one every other day just in case! LOL<br>  <br>  Baby dusy!|`|iO3BLRTYaa	none as i dont ovulate!

Best of luck!|`|zmbeIbx7aa	Second baby a little girl 33 weeks but only 5 left scheduled c-section.

Other than that I just plan on trying to relax and get as much sleep as possible since I know that will change when she gets here.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I am 35 weeks, and still working. It's hard some days. But my main focus is getting the nursery all decorated and in order, and getting my suitcases packed.

But it will be uncomfortable, esp at night.|`|f6qbRAmvaa	im 30wks4days along and i so ready for her to come out lol... for the next weeks we are moving out to a bigger house and well my moms friend wants to throw me a baby shower and well just wait till she gets here lol.... good luck and congrats :)|`|FfGHHhqBaa	i am 19w and 5d with baby #2 its a boy...<br>  congratulations|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i'm only 11 weeks. lol  i am very ready to give birth....this pregnancy thing doesnt go well for me...my first one was misery and this one isnt great either.  lol  only 29 weeks to go!! :oS|`|avkZGv1taa	I hit the 35 week mark yesterday!  I'm getting pretty excited--but my husband is just getting more and more nervous!  My plan for the next 5 weeks is just to enjoy being only me!  Sometimes when I am running late in the morning I think to myself--oh geez, in a few more weeks you will actually have to get this baby ready to go out with you!  It won't just tag along like it does now :)  It will be lots of fun, I know, I've been waiting long enough... but I am going to try to enjoy the last few weeks of being alone with my hubby (and try to reassure him that everything is going to be fabulous!)|`|glqk9pP4aa	Congrats!

Did you go on your due date with your son?  I ask because you could actually have your little girl anytime between 37 and 42 weeks.  <br>  <br>  Lets see... if I had 7-12 weeks left, I'd be making sure I had everything ready, I'd be spending some extra special time with my son and going on some dates with my husband, I'd be trying to do some things for me, since I wouldn't get much of that after baby's born, I'd be arranging for people to bring us food after baby's born so I don't have to cook as much, and I'd be really excited.|`|o2ehEqinaa	I'm 31 weeks and getting really really excited!!!  My plans for the next 9 weeks is to just keep hydrated.  I'm nervous about preterm labor and so I'm drinking as much water as I can to help prevent that from happening.  I also plan to start putting together my hospital bag and figure out how we're going to afford daycare come this summer!  Outside of that, I'm just enjoying being pregnant and love all the smiles everyone's giving me out in public!  Congrats to you and enjoy the rest of the ride!|`|sXCSVFBaaa	32 weeks and we have a lot to do:<br>  <br>  - take childbirth classes<br>  - write a birthing plan pronto<br>  - have a baby shower (my mom and friend are taking care of it)<br>  - prepare a hospital bag<br>  <br>  etc. etc. etc. But I'm excited and pretty much ready to not be pregnant anymore :)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I'm 23 weeks today and am anxious to get to where you are!
2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	You can go through many changes during pregnancy this could surely be because of the pregnancy.  I'd suggest having the doctor doublecheck your blood pressure on the next visit.  Variations in blood pressure can also cause lightheadedness and it's important that your doctor know that this is happening to you.  You need to do things slowly now since you are having these symptoms - don't get up fast, and make sure you hold on to railings and supports when you walk down stairs - and be absolutely sure not to climb up on anything without someone close by.  <br>  I would also ask how your diet is and if you need to eat more - it could also come from hunger.  And are you taking your vitamins?   Make sure you are getting good nutrition and plenty to eat.  Unless you safeguard yourself you could become depleted - your baby gets all its nutrition from you, so if you are not getting enough, your baby won't.  Signs for you would be weakness, fatigue and even lightheadedness.  You need to be eating roughly 2500 calories a day when pregnant, 3000 if breastfeeding - compared to 2100 when not pregnant.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  saw your note about blood pressure and fear of falling.  Just be cautious - you are carrying extra weight, your hormones are rampant, your body's equilibrium is now out of balance with the added weight and distribution and that alone could cause the vertigo( the dizziness you experience)  All kinds of body changes are taking place - those things alone can throw anybody off.  When I was pregnant I lost my sense of balance - every time I turned around I got dizzy, and my hair texture changed completely. I couldn't eat any of the same foods I ate previously.  I swear I ate cheeseburgers the whole time I was pregnant.   And I got breasts that never went away (wee!)  Yes, pregnancy is causing this change.  You need to be more cautious, and since you are experiencing this you need to take extra special care with your diet and at checkups with your doctor.  Your body is not the same as it was and all the changes can affect all your every day activities.  Today, if I took two 10 pound sand bags and attached them to my body on each side I'd have a hard time walking, getting up and down stairs, maintaining my sense of balance and I'd probably get dizzy moving too fast.  The body is accustomed to our normal daily existence, not this added weight gain and all the hormones that affect everything else.   Some women can carry on their normal routines, but I guarantee you, they will secretly admit that it's not the same.  You are not who you were so you can't do what you used to do, don't expect to be able to - go into everything cautiously.<br>  Just make sure to take care - and make sure you tell the doctor that this is happening so you can stay safe.  Enjoy the rest of your pregnancy - from the ground.  And don't go skydiving ;())

C55pji5Qaa	I did not follow the diet,their is no way I could,but I did keep up with her weight gain goals for each week.The girls are not here yet but they are average size for singletons(according to ultrasounds) and I think that is pretty good.Congrats and good luck!
3EiOobEVaa	It is okay you are still early just make sure that you are getting enough fluids.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	It's totally normal, expecially at this stage in the pregnancy where you aren't very far along|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Don't worry.  I'm 16 weeks and I didn't really have an increase in urination.  Maybe here lately I have had to go more, but earlier on I really didn't notice any change.  My little one is strong and healthy!|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Pregnant or not a good way to see if you are hydrated is by taking a look at your urine,Is it strong in color or in smell? The lighter the urine the more hydrated you are. So if you pee is a really rich color or smells strongly of urine then you will want to increase your water intake. As for how often you go everyone is different, I have a really strong bladder and can go a good while before having to pee.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	That is fine. <br>  As long as you are drinking enough and going a few times a day without pain, then you are fine.|`|61wXpXVxaa	Yes completely normal don't worry too much it's still really early for alot of symptoms.|`|AcxMUPdsaa	You are fine! It's coming believe me! I thought something was wrong with me around that time as well.  I am now 16 weeks and I think I went to the bathroom at least 4 times today and it's only 11 am! Good Luck!
AA10527784	Reality and Dreams are twin sisters. <br>  You should go and hug your child. We can not explain our dreams but our subconscious has insight on things that we do not fully understand. <br>  <br>  Ok...why are you still here reading. GO. the answers will be here when you get back.|`|XmO3nFSLaa	Well it is normal to have dreams and such about your children being hurt,.....I mean think about it...we sit here all day and worry about something horrible happening to our children, we see crazy things on tv that have happened to other kids so naturally we worry about it....so our subconscious sees that stuff and brings it into the dreams....Say a prayer that you will stop having bad dreams like that....it really helps!!|`|3648e98700b8351146e2b5699bd638ecaa	ever since they were born and now the oldest is 25, youngest 22 i'm still having nightmares......................|`|OMyC0IJVaa	I have had many of them over the years and it is very hard to shake the feeling. I am going to my sisters this December and it will be the first time I have ever left my kids for more than 1 night, they are 7 and 9. I am constantly having dreams about them being kidnapped while I am gone I am going to be a wreck before December even gets here LOL. And it is crazy because they will be with their dad and it is only for 5 days, the mind can play terrible tricks on us at times.|`|1cb9d97fc5fdf9070b04aad8d907f1fcaa	Actually yeah. I have dreams that my son stops breathing. So I check on him all night and put my hand on his back to make sure he is breathing. I really think all mothers do because we naturally worry about our kids....good luck
iaF9ABhnaa	Hey I<br>   agree with both girls that answered your questions in the beginning. Just keep in mind that yes it is stressful but their is help out there. I am not sure if its a good idea to move out. id move out until I had a good job. As long as you pay rent to your aunt and buy your own stuff to help her out as well. If your girlfriend agrees to be with you therefore this means she needs to agree with being with the kids too. So wheres the real mom? Can't you collect child support from her? Get food stamps and other programs for your babies. There are services where they can help you get free donations for ur kids. This is a big responsibilty. Yeah ull have to work hard but remember to always have time for ur kids and ur loved ones. Save up as much as possible and don't spend it on games or silly things that are not worth ur time. you are in a life situation here, the most important thing you need to think about is survival. Well good luck. I wonder what state u live in....|`|F8iyUqJBaa	If you are really planning to marry your girlfriend, whether she is their mother or not, you need to discuss these things with her.  Don't think of it as putting your life problems on her, think of it as, it's both of your lives if you choose to marry.  It will certainly make things easier for you if you know that someone loves you and your babies and they are willing to be there for the long haul.  Don't leave her out of choices and try to face the world alone, if she wants to marry you, then she wants to be included and help make decisions.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	if you are marrying your girlfriend...she is agreeing to take your babies as her own...so it shouldnt be a burden to her to help out with them.  also...there are government programs to help people like you out if you need it.  you can get housing, you can get most if not all of childcare paid for.  you pay taxes through your job to support these programs..if you are really in need of them...use them!!
Ccq8zEcnaa	I don't think you are pregnant, and don't have a good chance of being pregnant if you took plan B 5 hrs after unprotected sex. Most birth control becomes effective after a month of use. The risks of taking plan b alot may cause your cycles to be irregular and screwed up.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	The chances of you being pregnant are slim to none right now. Kudo's to you for being on bc and for taking plan b to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. It's very responsible of you. I don't think there are any risks of taking plan b so close together. I would ask your Dr or if you got it at a clinic ask someone there.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	You're probably safe, try to be more consistent with your birth control though. And medical tape on your patch is probably ok, ask your doctor just in case though. And I'm sure you're ok with the plan b, it was only twice.|`|ppJo1hCmaa	You are probably more than fine and your more than likely not pregnant.  I would have your boyfriend use a better brand of condom if you continue to use them.
eU5Eth2aaa	I did a home pregnancy test on the day I missed my period and got a negative result and then tested again when I was 7 days late and finally got a positive!<br>  <br>  I had slight cramping... It almost felt like my period would start at anytime.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you might be pregnant!  Take another test or schedule an appointment to have a pregnancy test done with your doctor!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11392250	Take another pregnancy test, because some test won't detect it early enough, so you will have to go to your local doctor and ask them what is wrong with you.
Kz5Fb0mPaa	After reading your input about the pregnancy tests, I would say she is definately pregnant! False positives are very rare!<br>  <br>  As far as heartburn, YES!!! This has been one of the hardest symptoms I have had. My heartburn is so bad at night that when I fall asleep the acid builds up and I get sick EVERY morning!<br>  <br>  Other symptoms I had in my first trimester: light cramps, nausea, frequent urination, very sensitive to smells, extreme fatigue.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|SRzswqTeaa	Heartburn is not usually a symptom at the beginning of pregnancy.  Heartburn in pregnancy is usually caused by a very large belly pushing up into your stomach.  Early pregnancy symptoms is a missed period.  You may not have any more symptoms for 2 more weeks after that.  Sore and fuller breasts can sometimes be a symptom as well as being drop dead tired.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Heartburn is common later in pregnancy, but is not a symptom. <br>  <br>  Is her period late?  Thats really the only reliable symptom.|`|8RfmosODaa	Yep heart burn is! Cramps, Implantation bleeding, Morning sickness, missed period, gas, sore breast alot of things you feel b4 a period.|`|uuHPneEcaa	heartburn is later on in the pregnancy.. <br>  <br>  some early symptoms are:<br>  fatigue<br>  nausea <br>  frequent urination<br>  eat a lot more<br>  tenderness/sore breast<br>  some bleeding and spotting<br>  and missed period (thats number one)<br>  <br>  if ur friend has missed a period have her take a pregnancy test.
vygYFdsSaa	That's a false statistic. It stays in your system for 40 days MAX and that's if you're a very heavy regular smoker. If you've been good and have't smoked during your pregnancy you should be fine.|`|i8Ch743Laa	It takes maximum 45 days,and that's if you're a bigger person and smoke all the time. Most hospitals DO test the baby.Not you,the baby. They do this with the baby's diaper. They test the baby's urine on the diaper.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I don't think they can legally drug test you for anything without your consent.|`|Cah6nfV5aa	I wasn't checked. Hopefully your not worried because you've been smoking, that would be horrible for your baby. If you have smoked during pregnancy you should inform your doctors so they can check the baby properly.|`|3EiOobEVaa	No they don't check you, but I heard they check the baby for THC.

n6XYYyoLaa	she will figure it out on her own, but if she does roll over while sleeping, don't worry...she's strong enough to roll, and to hold her head up, therefore she should be able to  move away if something were blocking her air intake; they recommend that once they roll on their own, to leave them that way, put them down on their back and if they roll, let them be...they do NOT recommend sleep positioners of any kind or rolled up blankets to try to  keep baby in place...only thing in baby's bed should be baby! she's also now less likely to get sids|`|deIzFnV8aa	It is slighlty more typical to have it happen the other way, but really it can be either.  A game we like to play is "roll over" (our DD is still working on both ways!" where I dangle a favorite toy to the side of DD. If she goes for it at all I help her roll the rest of the wya over,and say "look, you rolled over!"  Not sure how much this actually helps, but its fun :P|`|Cah6nfV5aa	My daughter did the same thing around the same time. Don't worry its not a big deal.  She eventually learned to roll the other way to it was just a couple of weeks after she learned to roll. I never had a problem with her rolling over in her sleep. I had her sleep with a sleep positioner and that prevented her rolling over. You can try that they work wonders and are cheap.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My daughter is doing the same thing. She hates being on her tummy and once she flips to her tummy she screams. She can't roll from tummy to back because she stabelizes herself so well. Maybe this is what yours is doing. See the way they learn the most is when it happens by accident.|`|7K6vpsdhaa	Well congratulations to her, she's learning early! My son is 5 months and can't roll over without a little help yet. I would say that they learn back to front first as they have to have more strength in their arms to turn front to back. She'll get more strength in her neck and back and learn to do baby press ups then she can turn back. <br>  <br>  She probably won't roll over in her sleep as she does in play time but as you said you will hear her if she's in distress. I've been a really light sleeper since I had my son and hear every whimper...must be a mother thing:-)|`|MavosJHYaa	I have the exact same problem. Mine actually learned to roll from tummy to back first, but she only did it a few times and then "forgot". She has been rolling from back to tummy for about a month now and still hasn't re-learned how to get back on her back. It will probably be best to get a sleep positioner for her when she sleeps. I say this b/c I had the most horrible experience ever....My daughter sleeps through the night, but she wakes up for about 15 seconds in the middle of the night, fusses and then goes back to sleep. She was sleeping in her crib in her own room and one night she did just like she always does fusses and then got quiet again. I had the most horrible feeling I needed to go check on her and when I did, she had rolled over and was flat faced down on the mattress. She now sleeps back in a bassinett in our room with a sleep positioner so I know she doesn't roll over in her sleep. Her doctor said it would be ok as long as she turned her head to the side when she was laying on her tummy, but obviously she didn't that one time. They will learn eventually to roll back over. I try now when she is having tummy time, to have her push up on her arms and then tip over. Just show her what she should be doing and eventually she will get the point.
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I am also 21 and also in NY (upstate) and can not imagine having 4 kids! I have one child and plan on having one more then after that I planned on getting my tubes tied. I am sure a Doctor would allow it in your situation since you have been trying to protect yourself but end up pregnant. I would talk to your Doctor when you go there next and I am sure they will let you know what needs to be done. |`|w3IGl1Ayaa	i cant foresee any problem for  you,ok your young,you have had 4 kids so you should know if you dont want any more,you are being sensible and mature about it and not making a snap decision,i had it done 7 yrs ago after my youngest daughter was born,i was a bit older but sure i didnt want any more kids(i have 3),when you go see the doctor just say what you are saying here and im sure he/she will understand good luck(btw i have twins too!although they are grown up now)|`|3648e98700b8351146e2b5699bd638ecaa	OMG! Don't! my wife got her tube tie and she regrets it. we wanted to have more kids, now we can't. we wish. were over 45 yr old. wait until your sure about this.|`|AA12064370	From what I have heard it is really up to the doctor if they tie your tubes or not. I would talk wiht your doctor now and see what he says and tell him/her you really want them tied considering you got pregnant while on BC and you do not want any more kids. |`|Ylrc1hkXaa	In the UK you have to see a counsellor, normally for 5 sessions, and they make the decision with your doctor.<br>  <br>  In my opinion the counselling should be provided but you should have the ultimate choice.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It's up to your doctor. (No doctor has to do elective surgery if he doesn't want to.)  If your doctor is unwilling, look for another.  <br>  But there are no longer any laws or restrictions on this.  You can have a tubal at 18, with no kids at all, if you can find a doctor willing to do it. 
AI2VoFP4aa	there is no such thing as a pregnancy period you cant have a period if youre pregnant. thats kind of the point. when you get pregnant you can bleed from implantation but its nothing like a period, its basically spotting. any other bleeding during pregnancy is a sign that somethings wrong.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I'm very familiar with my periods. For example, the first day is medium flow, the second heavy, the third light, and spotting for about 3 more days. When I was pregnant with my daughter I had a light to medium flow for a couple days, but I wasn't as in tune with my body as I am now. If that happened to me this time I would be very suspicious. but if your periods are on time then you are probably not pregnant. If you are concerned take a test, you will probably know for sure then. Take care:)|`|wKN7n2RKaa	When I had experienced it, I knew that something was "different".  I didn't know I was pregnant yet, but instead of my usual heavy flow, it was very light, and I didn't have any cramping.  I only had one cycle of this, and didn't bleed after this.  This was way different from when I miscarried once.  That time, I knew I was pregnant, but started experiencing very bad cramps, and within a half hour started bleeding lots.  That happened within the first month.  Best thing to do is check with your doctor, so you will be sure and not worry.  Good luck!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	While you may have some spotting during pregnancy, you don't actually menstruate.  When you have a period you are releasing an egg, and while you are pregnant you don't.  It is not normal to have any bleeding after the first trimester in pregnancy.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	The only sure way to know is to go into your doctor and have them run your blood to see if you are pregnant.|`|fTd509Qzaa	you might want to be a little more specific.  Never heard of Pregnancy Period|`|F8iyUqJBaa	There are no "periods" in pregnancy.  Some rare people do bleed sometimes.  But it's not a thing that is common at all.  Some women report that after they got pregnant they still had a period or 2 or 3, but for most women, that doesn't happen.  A period is the sloughing off of the uterine lining every month.  If you are pregnant then the baby is implanted in your uterine lining and it would not be sloughed off.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you dont get periods while pregnant. so one is there and one is not there or shouldnt be <br>  <br>  if you are bleeding go to er|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Most women do not experience bleeding like normal periods during pregnancy. Some do have some light bleeding or spotting in early pregnancy but it isn't usually like a menstrual period. Not to say that it doesn't happen, but not often. Anytime you experience bleeding while pregnant, it should be addressed by your Dr. Only they can determine if it is normal or something to be concerned about.|`|WPI0Z47saa	In early pregnancy everything can feel the same. You need a test to find out if you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  My mom had the same bleeding as she did with her period the whole nine months that she was pregnant with me and for 7 with my brother. So you can bleed just the same while pregnat granted it is rare but it does happen.|`|iZDsMCghaa	When I was pregnant with my 3rd I did bleed. I thought it was a period, came on time, lasted the same length and felt the same. But than I found out I was pregnant so it wasn't actually a period. It could have been decidual bleeding which can feel like it but aside from knowing, it felt the same as a period.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	The only way to know for sure is to take a test. Periods can be the same both in pregnancy and out so there's no sure way to tell the difference.
z6IekuwSaa	You do not want to put cereal in your baby's milk unless your doctor tells you so. It is not healthy for them, it's just empty calories, and it does not help them sleep through the night. The only reason they make the cereal is to teach baby's how to spoon feed with something that isn't as harsh on their tummy|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&action=detail&ref=857" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...</a><br>  Another way to express this rule of thumb is that the average baby takes 2 or 3 ounces of formula each day for every pound of body weight, up to a maximum of 32 ounces. A newborn weighing 7 lbs. will take an average of 14-21 ounces of formula in a day. A 4-month-old weighing 14 pounds needs 28-32 ounces.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, these are general guidelines. In real life, this may vary quite a bit from day to day and from baby to baby. It’s best to remain flexible and to let your baby’s appetite guide the amount. You don’t need to coax him to finish a bottle, or stop him if he still acts hungry. If your baby consistently chooses to take more or less than the expected amount, discuss this with your pediatrician.|`|96ydDKocaa	according to WIC and the doctors office they should be drinking 3 to 4 6 oz bottles a day no need to wake him to eat trust me if and when hes hungrey he will deff let you know|`|JE8lRn7Caa	yes dont wake him he will let you know when hes hungry. My 8 week old is sleeping 5 or 6 hours at night. If it would make you feel better you can put a tablespoon of rice cereal in his bottle you wont have to change nipples or anything and he will be more satified|`|avyv2i4baa	Hi, my 3 month old drinks 6oz (180mils) 5 times a day he sleeps all night from his last feed about 9 pm to 5.30 / 6.30 am|`|blKmv7bmaa	I let my son drink as much as he wants to i don't follow the book my son is 3 months old and he drinks about 6 8oz bottle just in the day then one throughout the night|`|ADEDkCgOaa	they can drink up to 32 ounces a day. also if he is sleeping that long without milk then he is fine.
8zdPI8Qsaa	I haven't ever been able to get some of the stains out of my son's high chair... especially now that his favorite food is spaghetti, that sauce stains SO badly.

Check to see what the weight limit is... I think they're all different.|`|aYMF7kNgaa	my little one was sleeping in hers as well, at 3 months we had to get her in her crib because her weight was to heavy for it, i believe she was 12 pounds.|`|ADEDkCgOaa	if your baby can get out of the play pen then he is too old. i have twins that are 11 months old and they sleep in one but my 2 1/2 year old can climb out of it so he doesnt. i know people that leave thier kids in playpens without buying a crib. we have a crib for night time sleeping though.

hOWNwpCLaa	It varies from person to person.  I didn't have any symptoms at all.

sjERiFeNaa	yep. the pull out method is -to put it nicely- VERY unreliable. just because he didnt orgasm, does not mean, in any way, that pre ejaculate sperm wasnt released. <br>  you need to go get a pregancy test luv!|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Yes there is a chance, but you won't know for another two weeks. Wait to test until your period is due.<br>  <br>  Withdrawal is not a method. Start taking the pill or make him use condoms.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Anytime you have unprotected sex you could end up pregnant. The withdrawl method does NOT WORK!  You may very well be pregnant. Buy some freakin' condoms.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I got pregnant with my last daughter using the pull out method. It's not birth control. You need to either be on birth control (pills, shot, iud) or make him use condoms. Or use both. The only way that you will know you are pregnant is if you take a test. You will have to wait until you miss your period to take it. The PMS like stomach cramps may be you ovulating. I know that I get those when I am ovulating. Good luck and hope all turns out well either way!!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, although he may not ejaculate in you he does release precum which contains sperm.  It only takes one sperm to make you pregnant.  Everyone I know who used the "pull-out" method has gotten pregnant.  It is not birth control.|`|R8bXuLbTaa	Yep. Exactly how I got pregnant.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	withdrawal is not a sure thing use a condom or the pill or better both|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Actually withdrawal IS pretty safe IF done right, each time. (According to RECENT studies) Most people just don't do it right.  If you're not due for another 2 weeks and having cramps then you are probably ovulating, so you are your most fertile time right now. If you're bf came in you in the past few days, there is a 25% chance you could get pregnant.<br>  <br>  EDIT- Not that I am recommending Withdrawal. It should only be used by people who are ready for a child, just in case. But apparently, it is pretty reliable because pre-*** does NOT contain sperm, UNLESS the guy has ejaculated within the last few hours and has not urinated since.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Unfortunately the pull out method is one of the biggest failed contraceptive methods. It doesn't work, because sometimes pre-sperm will come out before the actual ejaculation. I think you should wait 2 more weeks to see if your period starts, and if not then take a test. Your cramping may just be because you are about to start your cycle. Another thing, don't stress yourself worrying about whether or not you are pregnant, stress can make your cycle late.|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	There is definately a chance. I had period-like cramps a couple of weeks before my period was actually supposed to come. However, you could also be stressing over this which could be causing cramps. Wait a couple of weeks and see if your period comes. If not, take a HPT. If you cant wait, try taking an early detection HPT a few days before your expected period.|`|wLBsgNKAaa	It's very possible, but if you don't want to be then I hope you are not.  Sperm are tricky little devils and the withdrawal method does not always work since sperm can be in the fluids that come before ejaculation.  <br>  <br>  You are fortunate because some guys try to get girls pregnant on purpose so they can always be a part of their life.  Those guys will say they didn't release anything, but they actually did.|`|AA10015577	Prec-um isn't like a man's orgasm and he knows he is releasing, it comes out before and he can't feel it.  There is a chance but you need to just wait and see.  If you had sex very recently the chances are greater (28 day cycle) but any unprotected sex can get you pregnant!  Good luck!|`|DDFSITiYaa	Yes.  Unprotected sex = unplanned pregnancy.  <br>  Pull out method is not effective.|`|mlgsO5Ztaa	heck yeah!|`|j1akZve5aa	your screwed!! LOL.|`|fTd509Qzaa	any time you have unprotected sex, you can get pregnant.  Just because you you the pull-out method, doesn't mean that he didn't get any thing in you.  There is some thing called pre-***, which does contain sperm.  Your boyfriend has no control over that.  All he can do is pull out before he ejaculates.<br>  You really should be using some form of birth control if you are having sex and don't wish to get pregnant.  Educate yourself on the different methods and their success rate.|`|4lB9aEH5aa	Yes, there is a chance you are pregnant. Withdrawal is not a birth control method. The cramps might be because you are ovulating. They could also be a sign of a pelvic infection.  If the cramps persist more than a day or two, go to your doctor. If you don't want to get pregnant, ask the doctor for some real birth control too.|`|ppJo1hCmaa	Is your cycle regular?  <br>  <br>  The most accurate way to test for pregnancy is to wait until after your period is due. All pregnancy tests on the market will show a positive result, a higher percentage of the time, if you wait until this point.|`|35irl04Paa	yes there is a chance. Never use the withdrawal method. It is just a old wives tale that you cannot get pregnant. Pre *** can get you pregnant as well. Wait till your period is missed to take a test. There is no sense in wasting money on a test if your period has not come. It mostlikely will not be right if it hasnt been atleast close to your period.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Yes, there is a chance.  You need to take a test but unfortunately you will not be able to take one for at least another  week or so.  You can take a test about 5 days before your period is due.<br>  <br>  Pulling out method is not a good way to stay mommy and daddy free!|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Sounds like you are ovulating. Crampy, period not due for 2 weeks. You can get pregnant with pull out method. Im pregnant and we thought,"hey lets try it." pregnant on the first pull out method try...Dont risk it okay?|`|3EiOobEVaa	Yes there is a chance. The withdrawal method does not work and does not guarantee that you will not get pregnant. Wait to see if your cycle comes and if not take a pregnancy test.|`|63ff74d8b74029f44c5d4403dc78e14aaa	He's lying. He's not pullin' out in-time. That's an old line used on chicks so they'll have unprotected sex with you. Looks like you bought it hook, line, and sinker........|`|vygYFdsSaa	Those cramps are a possible sign of implantation. Use condoms if you're not ready to have a baby.
eGfAXaV3aa	I was talking to my husband about a party that we had just gone to...and I began to cry uncontrollably....for no reason! I thought I was going crazy...then my period didn't come on when it was supposed to...i figured then that i was pregnant...oh....but then I had implantation bleeding a week later and thought that I wasn't pregnant...but in the end I had to get a test at the doc's, because this pregnant stuff can get real confusing. Nonetheless...Sore boobs...peeing a lot...mild cramping....exhaustion..mood swings. Missing your period and implantation bleeding (looks like spotting)...pretty good signs.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I didn't. I thought my period was coming.|`|8RfmosODaa	I had sore breast|`|uuHPneEcaa	i ate a lot more. slept a lot more, used the bath room a lot more, my breast where always sore. and a lot more other stuff..  and my period was 5 days late and I am always on time with mine.<br>  <br>  I also had some implation bleeding. (it happened 2 weeks before my period was due)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I had a feeling I was pregnant, but didn't believe it until I missed my period then I didn't believe it until I took a test. Even when the test was positive, I still didn't believe it!|`|01vMpHkWaa	i was a week late on my period|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	gut feeling|`|7KYwQAxpaa	I didn't know I was. I watched the episode of friends where Rachel found out she was pregnant then took a pregnancy test on a whim. It was positive! I looked on my calender and noticed I hadn't had my period yet then all the sudden it made a lot of sense why I was so extremely tired ALL THE TIME. Today I am 6 months! It's a little boy!|`|AA10015577	With my first it was a missed period.  For this pregnancy I had sore breasts a week before my expected period and my intuition just told me I was pregnant.|`|wLBsgNKAaa	Everything I ate had a metallic taste as if I had a penny in my mouth.|`|YzCPY48qaa	i got morning sickness a week before my period was due and i was really pale and tired.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I knew I was pregnant because my period was late and I had very tender breasts.|`|3EiOobEVaa	I missed my period and I kept having to use the restroom. Plus I just had that feeling like I was pregnant.|`|I2UeqxKxaa	sore breasts and feeling sick|`|RjdrO7DVaa	sore breasts, nausea, being a week late, always tired, slight increase in appetite
93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	at that time the baby doesn't even have a placenta yet so it's not getting anything from you- your baby will most likely be fine. before i found out i was pregnant i went to a keg party for my BIL's birthday|`|i8Ch743Laa	No,those are the same ingredients in a lot of the approved medicines. I wouldn't worry about it. Even if it does have a different ingredient,you were so early on that it won't hurt anything. It's the same ingredients as tylenol cold products,which my dr said are ok.|`|MP1nA5fRaa	To ease your mind mention this to your doctor when you go in for your 1st pre-natal appointment.<br>  <br>  Same thing happened to me, I was petrified.  When I told my doctor what I took and when (OTC flu medicine) he told me I hadn't taken enough to do any harm.  He was right, I have a very healthy daughter!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i have never experimented with taking medicine while pregnant but i can tell you that only a doctor can give you the information you are requesting<br>  <br>  please be honest with your doctor and ask as i can tell you are concerned|`|wkd5CMNaaa	That will not affect your child's Development that early on, don't worry.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Worry not, Alot of women have this happen before they know they are pregnant. I actually got drunk 2 times and took flu pills (thought is was the flu ..nope baby :) before I found out. (I wasn't supposed to be able to get preg. w/out help, and we weren't trying) Your Dr. will tell you from now on only Tylenol (acetaminophen) Congrat's|`|0vpDDM8aaa	you have to keep in mind that most women dont know they are pregnant for at least 4-5 weeks.  so thats like....most women in the world who have given birth have had at least a month where they were living "normally" not knowing they were pregnant.  and most babies in teh world are not born with issues. :o)  relax.  dont do it again....mention it to your doctor...but stop stressing!!  :o)|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Those medications are all on my approved list from my doctor, so I think you will be fine. Talk to your doctor when you go for your first appointment. I doubt there is any reason to worry.
WLtsumGBaa	i dont know thats crazy. i almost want to agree with you seeing this in a picture album but then again who knows. maybe de ja vu. i know my husband asked his mom once of remembering a place in mexico and he described it to her and what happen, that they were on a bus and the bus stopped. she couldnt believe he remembered that because he wasnt even 8 months yet. he was maybe 6 months or somewhere close to being a new born. he had never been back to mexico since, and he remembered still  20years later. i guess anyhing is possible. unreal but still possible.|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	2 possibilities #1 Your parents have taken you there when you were little and they don't remember. A similar thing happened to me and an uncle backed me up that my dad had taken me to a place when I was little. My uncle and I both remembered but my Dad absolutely could not. #2 You saw pictures of the place in a family album or even on the Internet and that's why it's familiar.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	No it is not possible.|`|9m9gHZhpaa	No. it is not possible, as far as i know.|`|7i9ncEBdaa	Well, that makes no sense...there's no, like, visual...or...like, any sense-related information connections between the mother and the child. Just blood, nutrients, etc. Maybe, if you believe in such things, it was, like...something...I dunno, "beyond," I guess you could call it...?|`|vygYFdsSaa	No its impossible. Perhaps you saw a picture of the saw when you were younger.|`|hoGumKrHaa	It depends on what you believe in.  Medically, physically, scientifically- NO, you cannot- regardless of your beliefs. However, if you understand the notion of de ja vu or believe in spiritual realms beyond us- than there is something to it.  <br>  I cannot explain how, nor the significance of your remembering a place your mother insists you've never physically been to- but I get what you mean.<br>  <br>  I have experienced de ja vu and I have met people and experienced instant connection, as if we've always known each other.  <br>  <br>  My advice- don't dig too deeply, just enjoy the mystery of it.  :)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Not possible. You probably saw pictures in a vacation album.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i doubt you've ever been there.. de ja vu maybe..<br>  <br>  there is no way its possible to see thru your mother's eyes while in the womb..
WgIZUcYfaa	Around week 10. I've never craved something so bad that I felt like I HAD to have it.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	Mine started when I was about 3 months.  My cravings are mostly sweets, ice cream, cheesecake, & anything chocolate.|`|OuXnOkZuaa	Yea me too lost apitite and then lost 16 lbs and havn't gained any of it back yet..I'm 14 weeks with twins!! I only eat very healthy things and I crave fruit! It's the sweet smell of fruits like strawberries, nectarines, pineapple that has me scarfing them down lol, and I have weird cravings for raw tomatoes lol...I got over morning sickness about 11 weeks and still feel nauseous sometimes and don't feel like eating anything..but the cravings started even when I felt sick because fruits are hydrating and delicious and they were one of the only things I could eat without getting sick.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	I'm 27 weeks and the cravings started at about week 15 .. anything that was sweet ... im paying for it now because of the slightly high blood sugar (136)|`|O9ldQsGOaa	I was only 3 weeks pregnant and that morning I wanted warm bread so bad... I dont eat bread that much at all... I just HAD TO have it lol so my hubby went to his moms house and got me some warm bread.... weird i think
Ccq8zEcnaa	No there is no pill to make a woman fake a pregnancy, or even look pregnant. How many times are you going to ask this question? Maybe the woman is just a little bloated.|`|i8Ch743Laa	um you are being played the fool. That is impossible. I've never heard of such a thing.|`|avkZGv1taa	you already asked this question once this morning... thanks for the 2 points :)
0F8hauikaa	I wish I could help. I have a niece who has had the same problem since she was born and she's now 7. I've been trying to tell my sister to try some fish or flax oil after reading about a woman who said it cured her of the condition after many, frustrating years of failed treatment, but she only follows doctors orders. The way I see it is if the doctor's way isn't working, try to find something else. I'm not sure if a baby as young as yours can have oil supplements, so don't try it without doing some research. Good luck to you, I know it drives my sister crazy trying to comfort my poor little niece.|`|X6as2nOAaa	My nephew has really bad eczema so my sister takes the hydrocortizone and doesn't rub it into his skin she just lets it sit on his skin, she puts a lot on him too! It still looks white on his skin because it is not rubbed in and it makes it so he doesn't itch, she also uses the free and clear detergent as well as washing him in hypoallergenic everything and this has really seemed to help it calm down.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My son will be 3 on Monday and he has a pretty bad case of eczema as well. We do what his DR suggested, but he still has patches all over, although the itching is controlled. We wash him with Cetaphil cleanser, even his hair, because anything (even regular soap) can be irritating. After bath we use hydracortizone cream on the patches, and then cover him with Vaseline. We also use Bacitracian and Lotrimin on some of his patches as they are prone to infection and he developed ringworm on a couple of them.|`|J0RhP4N7aa	Hi, I am Gill and I have a 5yr old girl with eczema, I  have tried every thing to get her to sleep without scratching. There is a new company called www.skinniesuk.com that has specialist clothing for reducing scratching and I believe they have baby grows. They are used at Shefield Childrens hospital, so must be good, I have ordered a vest from them. My friend from a suport group was on a trial with them and she said they are amazing and her little boy has improved alot because he likes the feel and colour and will wear them with no fuss. She says they are worth every penny. <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Gill|`|hNIof0lbaa	Oh lord, I know where your coming from here.. both of my girls have eczema as well as my husband. My older daughter who's 3 1/2 gets it really bad in certain spots, right now its really bad under her knees, and the cream is not working..due to her constantly scratching it. I plan on calling our Ped see about getting her this shot that they have (not sure of the name yet) My husbands brother gets this shot & you cannot even tell he has eczema. Now for my 6 mth old...she has had it severely ever since she was born....on her face horribly bad, the dr prescribed Mupirocin  which is a very thick ointment to put all over her & he prescribed Desonide 0.05% cream to put over the thick stuff  - needless to say, this really helps her when she gets horrible break outs. What I usually do is put baby socks on her hands at night so she cant scratch...and keep pants on her. Although, she will constantly rub her face everywhere to scratch, theres not much to do about that but keep putting more cream on it.. :(  I know its so horrible when their babies especially. You may want to ask your Ped about this shot (I will also update you once I find out what the name of it is from him tonight) and how young you can be to get it. I sure hope your little one feels better. Nothing worse than not really being able to do much of anything for them..

aLAmvX5Naa	But you know, babies need clothes, blankets, and college money. I'd be thrilled to get clothes or diapers as a baby gift. That is perfect.<br>  <br>  If she has a registry and you see a car seat on there, sure, get it. But I promise you she'd appreciate anything.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I always like the supplies that add up. Diapers in various sizes, Balmex (better than Desitan), baby wash, onesies in various sizes, pacifiers, cloth diapers, Eucerin, and other toiletries that add up when you purchase yourself. Place them in a basket and wrap with a baby blanket!|`|bmWKETgWaa	One new mom I knew said she would be using cloth diapers.  They weren't hard to find, but the plastic pants that go over them are not so widely available.  Finally I found some at Wal*Mart, and got her several pairs in each size up to one year.<br>  <br>  They can be washed along with the diapers, but they need to be set aside before putting the diapers into the dryer.  Drying plastic pants for a full cycle in the dryer will wreck the elastic.  What I used to do was wait until the diapers were just finished drying.  Then I'd pull some dry diapers out, and put one inside each pair of clean plastic pants.  I would then put them all back into the dryer with the warm, dry diapers for five minutes more.  The plastic pants came out dry and soft, and the elastic could stand that short time in the heat.|`|sm4wXNOqaa	Mylacon Gas Drops.  I mean it.  Little babies get gas and they cry and first time parents don't know why they are crying.  Maybe you could get a little basket or diaper bag and fill it with baby pharmaceuticals.  Baby tylenol, or baby motrin, gas drops, orajel, desitin for diaper rash etc.  This would have been most useful to me.|`|66633d9122b3aa8042ed5b75071a98d0aa	I got a diaper cake and it was a nice little trophy to keep and had a whole bunch of goodies. You should see whats on her gift list. Things she'll need will be car seat, infant bathtub, stroller, diaper bag, play pen, bassinet, crib-convertibles the best, mattress, sheet set, bed set and even a gift card would help her get the things she didn't get.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	At the last shower I went to I gave a gift card to a portrait studio. She loved it!|`|X0f444TOaa	Everyone gives clothes, washcloths, bibs, etc.  Diapers are always useful, but some families only use a certain brand.  Why not make her a little box to put keepsakes in (first tooth, lock of hair, etc.) or a scrapbook?  Homemade gifts are always original and Pat Catan's or Michael's should have everything you need.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. - Check if she's registered at Wal-mart, Target, or Babies-R-Us too!
f792152a01f315142e38e20fe08d53b6aa	I you were my kid and brought that kind of thin home you would be getting the belt! OK but seriously.

If you don't, you deserve what you get.<br>  <br>  Add: Kiddo, you said it, you screw around. Do you think you can screw up deliberately and have no consequences? Face the music, your mom will have more respect for you. Leave the cell for after school. Trust me, nothing is that important it can't wait till after school. Is is worth no cell and no 'puter?

And also, it's better off for you in the long run if you face what happened and tell her. It will also show maturity to your mom that even though you knew there would be consequences you still fessed up.  Obviously you need some discipline too- your grades kinda suck. And you seem somewhat rude and spoiled.|`|lNyMwCFLaa	Just show her. You've got to take responsibility for your actions, it's not like you won those grades in some kind of a lottery, you earned them.

It is wrong and you know it. As for your grades if you don't show your mom or you lie to her about them you are going to get into more trouble than if you showed her. Now I don't know how your mom is with grades and what not, but at least you would be honest with her and then you and her can come up with a plan to get your grades up. At least let her know what is going on.|`|xy9Oe2gHaa	you should be honest with ur mom<br>  but first sweeten it up. be really nice to her the whole day, and then wait until before you go to bed and show it to her. promise her you will do better and tell her the grades are low because you have been having trouble understanding things lately, and tell her your grades will be up in 3 days. i did that and it worked :]
1nDxiOdjaa	Is this your first baby?  If so, relax it will be a couple weeks.  If it is your second baby keep a stop watch handy...you could go into labor any time.|`|LsyFyzaSaa	YAY!

I have been losing my mucus plug over the past couple days.  Im effaced at 80% and the doctor says i will DEFINITELY not go the full 40 weeks.

First, I think it is wise to consider whether or not you will force your child to spell their name each and every time they meet someone new.  Secondly, your child isn't going to be brought up in Egypt (I assume), so you can also assume that no one will understand the meaning you assign to it.  Thirdly, I remember seeing a comedy special with someone named Brandin.  Not "Brandon", but Brandin.  He had a ten-minute tirade about how his parents had cursed him.  It was funny, but it sure brings the point home.  <br>  Lastly, as your child goes to school, children are incredible at making up horrible names to those with "different" names.  I thought of AmuNUT, U a Nut?, Ah Mullet just sitting here for two seconds.  <br>  One option is that you may want to assign that name as a middle name.  That may be a good compromise.   <br>  One last thought...some parents name their children strange names and spellings to exert control.  Good thing to consider.  As long as you keep your child in mind first, you'll do great.

oRMEtsJwaa	sounds like the baby is dropping and moving into position. You sound like you are having contractions with your belly getting tight. It might be false labor, but if the contractions get close or you're still unsure call your doctor. It doesn't hurt to call and your doctor, who knows your medical history, can advise you better. Good luck and congratulations!<br>  <br>  |`|ZFdPlfbhaa	Yes, that is normal.

PeMpDAbraa	I would hope that he would love the child more than you...you are selfish. Grow up and move on b/c you are just gonna make it harder for him. Who knows if it is his or not...but you are in no position to request he not be with his child..he may warm up to being a daddy.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Well there is only one choice to make really. The baby isn't going to go away and your boyfriend has already said he is going to do the right thing and support it. All you have to decide now is do you care for him enough to deal with this? Because his first priority for the next 18 years or so is going to be his little girl. That's a huge decision for you to make. If you don't feel ready for that kind of responsibility then perhaps now would be a good time for you to move on. Yes it would hurt, but you still have your entire life to live. You can't be carefree when you're a step-mom with responsibilities. You've only known this guy for 3 months - is he honestly worth the effort? Only you can know the answer to that. :-)|`|MLLCn4weaa	I don't know how old you are - but I'm imagining you as quite young.  If you are I would say - leave - or actually leave anyway regardless of your age.  This is a complicated situation which is fine if you go into it with your eyes open - which you didn't.  It sounds like he's doing the right thing by his child as he should have contact with her - but you will find that a strain and undoubtedly the child will come and stay with him sometimes - particularly as she gets older. <br>  <br>  I think it's probably easier for everyone if you each deal with this separately. You by moving on, him by spending some time getting to grips with his new situation and the new mum and baby getting to terms with new motherhood and bonding.  Tough I know, but I think it would be best for you.|`|AA11850523	My partner doesn't particularly like children, he doesn't get the whole thing and is particulary unpaternal.<br>  He's a good guy <br>  <br>  he might not children - but he likes putting his appendage into her <br>  he might not get the whole thing- she "got " the whole thing <br>  he's a good guy- for a cheater<br>  <br>  leave him alone and let him sort  out his problems  |`|ErCJnABBaa	You have gotten yourself into a relationship with someone that comes with excess baggage.  You are going to have to ask yourself if you are willing to enter into a marriage with someone that brings additional burdens to the burdens that come with any marrige, or is it better to move on and find someone that comes with fewer strings attatched?<br>  <br>  And even though the events that created this baggage occured before you met, it still speaks to the character of this person.  How does his past actions compare with your own moral base?<br>  <br>  You've just got to evaluate these things, and do so from the standpoint of looking for a life-time commitment, and decide what is best for you.|`|kjawaCZAaa	Well my dear, you have some big decisions to make. If this is in fact his child (and I hope he gets a paternity test) then he WILL be a part of this child's life one way or another. He may choose to help raise the child in which case the child would be a very large part of both your lives. If he chooses to not see her then he will be expected to pay child support in which case you would see hundreds of dollars go out the door every month. So you need to decide if this guy is worth the sacrifices you will have to make.<br>  I can only speak for myself but if I were in your shoes this guy would have to be a best friend, a confidant, and committed to me and our relationship for me to move forward. Any jealously on your part is purely insecurity. So if you find yourself doubting him and your jealously taking over then I really think it might be time to cut this one loose.<br>  Good Luck. I know it's not easy.|`|fNgv2FeRaa	If he's not responsible enough to put something on the end of it what chances has he got in a relationship.<br>  <br>  Plus he's not going to have any money now he's paying for his kid.<br>  <br>  Dump him.|`|yPMCfIh5aa	i will be sooo hard dont think i culd do it to be honest, ive your guna break the relationship off id do it sooner rather than later so he knows where he stands x x|`|GVg6mHI1aa	<br>  What a load of baggage you don't need,<br>  <br>  Get shut of him and fast !!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  If not you have only yourself to blame.<br>  <br>  You've only been with him 3 months |`|waYuAmhEaa	Too much drama....save yourself the heartache and stress and move on. |`|7tbdtMWTaa	its completly your choice, i have step children, as my partner was in a long relationship b4 and we have them both full time (custody battle long story) and its hard sometimes as b4 we had free time and now we have full time kids.. at the end of the day if you stay with him you will become a step mother and if you decide on kids in future they will be brother/sisters, its difficult as you will feel you come second as thats his flesh and blood,and will prob get harder in future, with contact.. but i can say from experience, i love my step kids and have gone from me and my partner having free time to being full time parents/mum.... and kids takin over.. its hard and stressfull but wrth it, you have to ask yourself are you strong enough to cope with whats happening.. im currently pregnant with my first baby so will have 3 kids..you either can be strong and cope or decide to leave it and end relationship..only you truly know the whole story and how you feel.. good luck xx|`|Gcdt9U3Aaa	He is bound to love his child more then you but in a very different way, children have unconditional love from a parent, you love them because they're yours, however a partner you grow to love down to the person they are, the things they do, the interests you share, he wont stop caring about you because the baby arrives.<br>  <br>  Once the baby does come things will change a lot, he'll spend time with her which may mean you wont get to see him as much. Are you sure you can handle that if you're already being eaten up by it now? you said one very telling thing in your question "but if my future partner was un paternal as this one " clearly you don't see a real future with this guy otherwise you wouldn't be referring to "future" partners being the same as the guy you're with now, if you see no real future together then do you not think it would be easier to break away from it now before the situation really hurts you.|`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	But he should love his child more than you. But the love is different that is all. He will feel the need to protect his daughter, love her unconditionally no matter what she ever does or say etc.<br>  <br>  I am glad he is saying 'my daughter' now and not 'the kid'. At least that shows he has some feelings for his unborn daughter and does not just think of her as a mistake like you seem to.<br>  <br>  You sound very unfeeling when you keep calling this baby 'the child'.<br>  The baby is the innocent one in all of this. She has never asked to be born into a broken family with, to be quite honest,  a stepmum who already sees her as a problem, pain etc.<br>  <br>  You sound like you are a good person, who given time could come round to this and probably learn to love this girl as well. It won't be easy but you will need patience, and stop doing the ME ME ME bit. That is unfair on your partner and if when his daughter is Born, he feels you are trying to pull him away from her then you will most probably end up on your own.<br>  <br>  Children should always come first, but that does not mean you won't get a life with your partner. Just remember it will be the mother who ends up doing all the hard work|`|krPMGnMAaa	if shes 3month pregnant she wont know what it is, you have to be 20weeks to find out the sex, i think shes lying, on the other hand, if shes not lying you will have to deal with your partner being a father, or find someone else. if you love him enough you will go through anything with him, just remember, this is a life time commitment. theres a chance shes lying though, and ofcourse a chance the babys not even his, she could of been sleeping with loads of people and be telling them all the same thing, but if shes saying shes 3month pregnant and its a girl, shes lying......<br>  <br>  <br>  you love your children very differently to what you do with a partner|`|kk8p6yvsaa	His life is too complicated for you.  Save yourself a lot of grief and heartache by taking the next exit.  You don't need all these complication in your life.  You will find someone who will be exclusive to you.  Good luck.|`|lw24mWB7aa	Move on out of there whilst it's still early days - you guys should be enjoying each other, not dealing with a load of really heavy baggage this early on; unless you really, really love this guy already.  |`|3648e98700b8351146e2b5699bd638ecaa	"partner doesn't particularly like children"? get his A55 out of your life. he not worth crying for over spill milk. he's a jerk.

I know you like him, but:<br>  <br>  1.  He slept with someone else without protection just before he got together with you - that shows bad judgment.<br>  <br>  2.  If this woman is telling the truth, she'll be part of his life forever.  I don't think it's worth it to you to get involved with this "love triangle."  If you guys get married and have kids, they're always going to have to deal with this additional baggage.<br>  <br>  You're in the early stage of the relationship - I know you like him, but I think you need to seriously consider moving on and finding someone who's free to offer you his full time and attention.|`|bwDryVkIaa	i have been through this. <br>  i got together with my ex boyfriend a month after he had split from his pregnant girlfriend. i didnt really forsee how hard it would be.she didnt want me around understandably and i found it so hard to deal with them spending time together as a family after the baby was born.i felt it was them and me.im not saying its going to be the same for you but im am telling you, its not going to be easy hon. he will be experiencing somthing new and amazing with someone else and the person who is going to get hurt is you. now i have a new partner and baby myself i know now how it should feel. my ex is now back with his girlfriend and the child, i wish them luck but i do know that if he hadnt have had the baby with her we would prob still be together, my advice to you is to get out now before you get more attached im sorry if thats harsh i just now how damm hard this will be   xxxx|`|mXYAHX0Gaa	I met my now-husband a month after his daughter was born and I can relate all too well.  While we were dating, my husband straight out told me, "My child comes first."  And as much as you understand intellectually, it will still hurt.  Secondly, if you decide to stay with him, this woman will be a part of his life.  There is no way around it and no, it isn't easy.  Thirdly, if you decide to stay with this man in the long-run, You may not be able to have children early into your marriage because with his paying child support, you simply can't afford it as a couple.  You also won't be sharing "child firsts."<br>  <br>  It's normal to feel selfish and jealous.  There is no right or wrong, but whether you can adapt to the situation.  |`|vXFuaVLJaa	Are you serious? "love the child more than me?" He is a dad. If he does not love his daughter more than you, and you have only been together 3 months, then he is a piece of ****. I cannot believe you are asking such a question! He is bound by BLOOD to his little girl. She will always be there, and there will always be eternal forgiving love, he will always consider her first, and not you, because you are a grown woman, and being jealous of a baby is 100% selfish as hell. That is his daughter, he's not going to sleep with her, and yes, if you stick together, there is a chance he can love you just as much as her, but in a completely different way, but his child will always come first. You should be happy for him. Yes, it might be hard to get used to this, but you are not completely tied down right now. He had a one night stand with her, not an ongoing relationship. Yes, they will always have to keep in contact with each other for the babies sake, but it doesn't mean that he will be cheating on you, or trying to be with her. They have a baby together.

The pregnancy tests can tell in early stages but the ones that always worked for me and never failed is Pregnosis brand test try that its at most chemists and that can tell very early. let me know after you try it and what happens.

So are home pregnancy tests, and nowadays you can test almost as soon as you're late. Just go to the drugstore, buy a test, and take it first thing in the morning (for greatest accuracy). If it's negative, but you still don't have a period after a few more days, you should probably go to a clinic or doctor for a blood test, especially if you start to feel sick to your stomach, have to pee all the time, get very tired for no reason, or if your breasts start to swell. Even with no other symptoms, you wouldn't just miss a period for no reason, so if those goes on for more than a few weeks, you should probably seek real-life medical help anyway. Good luck.|`|fS4Ed5IYaa	As long as you put the condom on correctly and no semen got on the outside of the condom, most likely you're ok.  Just because you're late on your period doesn't necessarily mean you're pregnant.  Stress is a big one to make you late- and if you're stressing over an unplanned pregnancy then it's probably making your period even later!  If you're that worried just take a pregnancy test.  Then you'll know for sure.|`|QYNcktzlaa	I would think not.<br>  <br>  If he put the condom on correctly and no sperm entered the vagina then you should be okay. Of course not all contraceptives are 100% but I find that stressing about something will cause your menstrual cycle to go haywire. <br>  <br>  If your period still doesn't show after a few more days and you think you're pregnant then I suggest picking up a pregnancy test at the drugstore. First response is good. It's really easy to read. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|Vd0jofopaa	Simplest answer is...if you had sex with a condom or not you could be pregnant.<br>  <br>  More complex answer is...just because you are late doesn't mean you are pregnant because a lot of things can throw your period off such as STRESS, and even the food you eat. Before I had sex the first time I was very late and I ran to the doctor because I was sure something else was wrong. I was working two jobs and going to school....stress was the reason.|`|X8qr7kckaa	Are u on birth control that could be it and or if u changed birth control also but if ur period doesn't come in a week or week in a half take a test of go to ur dr. to be in the safe side to make sure nothings wrong!!|`|hKcS5NrXaa	there's always a chance.<br>  you should go see your doctor to find out.<br>  (those cheap pregnancy tests are crap).<br>  don't get worried too much.<br>  you might not be.<br>  but if you are..<br>  congrats!!! :D<br>  <br>  don't get an abortion cause then you'll be a baby killer.|`|5bxjnlwraa	You could certainly be pregnant, but periods can be late also.|`|voNJSju5aa	you could but your probably not b/c u used a condom .i learned about sex in 2nd  grade|`|f2V3eZj6aa	you could be, condoms can just simply not work even if it didnt break.|`|R7Yjo9xSaa	TAKE A TEST<br>  people on the internet can not tell you if your are preggo|`|01xWq63jaa	you might be <br>  <br>  condoms aren't always 100%

Its normal though.|`|7RRn22V0aa	I wouldn't say it's normal, but my husband has done it all his life.  Sometimes he will lay on his side and go from front to back repetedly, very quickly....it doesn't even seem physically possible.  Other times he will be on his back and his head is only rocking.  His mom said his crib would shake because he was doing it as an infant.  I asked my pediatrician, he says it can be linked to ADHD.<br>  <br>  why the thumbs down?  I know exactly what is going on.  It's not the rooting reflex, it's not going to turn into a game....you have to see it too see what's going on.  It cant be controlled, I'm sure it's alittle more alarming seeing an infant do it, but my husband has done it since birth.  It's worse when he's exhausted or stressed.  And to say it's normal is inaccurate.  The childs pediatrican needs to be informed to determine if it's a benign condition.|`|ac5gX7sNaa	I'm not saying im right but it might be his reflexes. My daughter did that from birth until around 2 1/2 months. She was not used to feeding from her mouth (because in my belly she was fed through the umbelical cord) so she would turn her head from side to side over and over again until she found the nipple or pacifier. It was pretty scary seeing her do it at first but then i realized what she was doing. <br>  <br>  Like i said, i may be wrong so maybe it would be best to bring it up at his next doctors appointment :)|`|AA11095350	Well, is it really spastic and constant, or just the odd twitch and jerk every now and then?  For some reason, a lot of babies will get jumpy around two or three months. Swaddling helps for the most part. My younger son did that, and I started using a pillow with the little indentation in the middle (looks like a baby version of a doughnut pillow). I'd put his head on there, and he'd be unable to jerk it around so much.|`|xyrzDjgdaa	Like he is saying no? It is not a problem, eventually he might even think it is a game. It is good for his neck strengthening, too.<br>  <br>  My experience? My husband and son sit at opposite ends of the dinner table and shake their heads no at each other nearly the whole meal every night. Liam thinks it is funny, Daddy likes to annoy Mommy who is trying to get Liam to eat.  lol|`|IdIkjR0Laa	I'm not sure if this is what you are talking about but babies have what's called the rooting reflex(they are looking for the nipple).  It usually last until the baby is about 4months old, but can last longer. HTH|`|AA11929339	hmm, didnt experience this with my 6 month old. if it really worries you that much, bring him to the ped. i hope it's nothing serious :(

Il mio consiglio è quello di cercare di frequentare dei ragazzi..uscire e vedere se qualcuno di loro riesce a farti provare le stesse sensazioni che provi nel vedere la tua amica. Se si allora i ragazzi ti piacciono se invece la tua amica resta sempre e cmq al primo posto potrebbe essere che ti piacciano le donne..o magari entrambi i sessi. Però potrebbe anche essere che ti piaccia questa tua amica perchè siete molto simili e la senti vicina a te...forse se incontrassi sul tuo cammino un ragazzo altrettanto dolce e disponibile forse ti perderesti per lui! Prova ad aspettare e cerca di ascoltare te stessa..e stai tranquilla perchè se anche dovessero piacerti le donne nn sarebbe assolutamente un problema =)|`|60eHpUJ9aa	Probabilmente si tratta solo di nuove sensazioni pre adolescenziali..Devi stare tranquilla e capire realmente quello ke provi..hai soltanto 14 anni..ascolta il tuo cuore..vedrai quella è la strada giusta..anke se ti porta verso la tua migliore amica nn c'è nulla di sbagliato..si te stessa sempre e in ogni momento..baci<br>  Sl ballerina!|`|Brqu10Zfaa	Un momento, non agitarti, devi sapere che la tua è una fascia di età molto critica, dove gli ormoni sono portati a scatenarsi e a creare quel po' di caos che ti manda in confusione tale da non farti più capire se sei attratta dall'altro sesso o da quello uguale al tuo. Non devi preoccuparti! E' possibilissimo che tu prova attrazione per la tua amica perché la conosci bene, ti sta simpatica, torvi che sia carina e quindi è normale provare questo tipo di voglia di andare oltre l'amicizia, se così si può dire... vedrai che crescendo sarai più che attratta verso i maschietti! E comunque sia anche se fossi lesbica non c'è nulla di cui vergognarsi, sei un essere umano anche tu e farti valere e rispettare è il minimo che tu possa fare... lo dico davvero. In bocca al lupo!

In ogni caso come già ti hanno suggerito prima di saltare a conclusioni pensaci bene, cioè pensa fino a che punto arriveresti (lo so detta così sembra brutta >_<) e se ti potresti sentire attratta da altre ragazze. Per il fatto che non ti piace nessun ragazzo, beh può capitare ^-^'' io ho quasi 17 anni ed è da due anni che non mi piace nessuno....Ah comunque non far si che questa tua confusione diventi un peso o un'ossessione, bisogna solo stare tranquilli e ragionare a mente fredda...poi quando ti senti sicura di te puoi provare a parlarne con qualcuno più vicino a te...E se mai scoprissi di essere lesbica o bisex e avessi paura di dirlo alle tue amiche....beh se sono realmente tue amiche ti accetteranno di sicuro ;) <br>  Ciao e buona fortuna ^_^ chu!|`|HiULyGtFaa	Beh anche se ti piacessero le donne non ci sarebbe nulla da temere; non ti dovresti sentire "in difetto".

BNExLmZzaa	Moi c'est pareil, depuis 1 mois je ne sens plus vraiment les coups nets et forts qu'il me donnait au début ! C'est plus des mouvements, ses fesses quand il appuit, ses points, etc ...<br>  Par contre certains matins quand je suis encore au lit et que je suis sur le dos, je sens les mêmes coups d'avant ! Mais bon, ?a devient rare maintenant puisqu'il a quand même bien grandit.<br>  <br>  Mais l'essentiel c'est qu'il continue à bouger et qu'on le sente encore ! <br>  Mais je crois que ses mouvements me manqueront le jour où j'aurais accouché !|`|ea523954a41446e6896e1eea470cb574aa	je suis à 7 mois et demi et je le sens se déplacer, il donne des coup, surtout quand je suis dans mon bain !!<br>  mais il est vrai que c'est moins fréquent qu'avant, et que son papa ou son frère ne le sentent plus aussi clairement quand ils mettent la main sur le ventre. Par contre, pour ma part, je le sens beaucoup plus.<br>  Ce qui m'embête, c'est que je ne suis pas très douée pour déterminer si c'est un pied ou les fesses ou autre... :(|`|NAMjLgWAaa	plus tu avances dans ta grossesse plus bébé grossit et grandit, donc c'est logique que tu le sentes moins car il a moins de place, mais je comprends que c'est inquietant... moi je suis a 7mois et elle bouge enormement!!! alor elle ne doit pas encore trop grandit et grossit pour bouger ainsi lol... rassure toi, tant qu'il bouge régulierement il n'y a pas d'inquietude a avoir!!!<br>  bon courage bonne fin de grossesse  bise|`|R6sLjKRTaa	c'est qu'elle commence a etre a l'etroit<br>  si tu ne la sens pas de la journée, va consulter<br>  petite astuce : faire parler le papa sur le ventre !!! pour le mien, ca marchait bien !|`|c6e52b17ac17af2a41c3070961d060ccaa	le bébé bouge et donne de coups.<br>  c'est quelque chose qu'on ne peut vraiment oublier. pendant ma première grossesse mon enfant ne bougait pas beaucoup j'avais meme peur.<br>  mais pendant ma 2ème grossesse mon bébé me donne des coups n'importe quel heure.|`|6dbc0a3db570380276e5d0eb26477e0aaa	C'est normal, et c'est même plut?t bon signe, puisque ?a veut dire qu'elle grossit, qu'elle a de moins en moins de place.<br>  <br>  Pour l'instant je suis qu'à 6 mois pleins et je sens des coups toute la journée.<br>  <br>  Après, si tu es très active, c'est normal aussi que tu la sentes peu vu que plus tu bouges, plus le bb est bercé. |`|2e7c185b2480e7e7e2b3f7ae575b8a40aa	Il y a des bb qui bougent plus que d'autres.

HXfHkoSHaa	I didn't have such a severe case as this.  Sorry you are going thru it so early.  You are so right in switching doctors, though.  You need one who cares enough to take care of you and baby.  Congratulations on the pregnancy, and I hope for the best for you both.|`|kPz0pyckaa	The doctor isn't worried? I would be at least moderately worried because those are symptoms that you will end up getting pre-e later in your pregnancy.  I would be seeing a new doctor asap. <br>  <br>  I never had either of those problems but good luck and I'm glad you're seeing a new doctor.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I've never had it that soon, I highly recommend researching HELLP syndrome and joining the chat groups.  You will get amazing information there and will meet other women with experience in this area.  Good luck!|`|aEpPt9koaa	I never had hbp or issues with protein and I dont know much about pre-eclampsia and toxcemia but it seems like  you are on the right track by visiting other doctors and seeking second opinions.
lwlZMhiqaa	I worked in a school and was due in the beginning of July.  I wanted to work up until the end of the school year, I would have been about 39 weeks.  But around 37 weeks I had to stop working, it was just too much.  You are the only one who can decide when it's becoming too much for you, don't be embarassed to stop working or anything, because you know your body.  Congrats on the pregnancy!|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Every single aspect of your life will change when you have a baby.  It's not easy...every new parent feels overwhelmed by the changes they experience.  You will adjust.<br>  As for your career...you need to decide what your needs and your priorities are.  First and foremost, you need to be able to afford to pay your bills.  Do what you need to do to cover your NEEDS first.  If your needs can be covered by taking a lesser position and lesser hours, then that's great, because you have that option open to you.  Once that option is open, then you need to decide whether your *desire* to keep your position is more important than having more hours at home with your children.<br>  I can't tell you what decision you should make...that has to be up to you.  I can only say that while taking a step back in your career vs always pushing forward like you're used to doing might be hard to think about, you now have something that is so much MORE important to work for.  Your baby's childhood will be gone in the blink of an eye.  If you can *make* the career sacrifice, I promise there is no sacrifice that's MORE worth making.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i am a stay at home mom...and encourage any and all moms to do the same!!  there are jobs that you can do from home...or jobs you can take your baby along to (housecleaning for individuals or buisnesses....can pay upwards of $12 an hour or more....babysitting in your home, etc)  my husband and i decided long ago that there was no way we would ever leave our child at a daycare or have someone else raise her for us every day.  we want to know what she is learning...we want to see her first steps and hear her first words...we want to know how much attention she is getting and who is giving it...and those are things you can't know or see if you are not with that baby.  there are a lot of bogus stuff being taught to kids...and we wanted to make sure that our kids got a Biblical perspective on life :o)|`|4SDqRs6Laa	Once you hold your baby you will most likely have your own answer. A newborn is definitely a full time job and it may not pay $$$ but it pays in ways money can't buy. Chances are you may not even want to return for work for a while if you want to be there for your baby. I thought the same thing, work after one month. Now my baby is almost 3 months and I don't want to work for 2 years!? :p|`|xVecKF26aa	I think you need to go part time right now.<br>  I know change is hard, but you need to give yourself more time to adjust to how your life will be with your new baby.  It will turn your world upside down!  If you go part time now, you will get used to working part time and have more time to get things ready for the baby and preparing yourself for the change in your life.  <br>  When I was pregnant, I planned to work all the way up to when I went into labor as well, but 2 months before he was born...I just could not do it anymore.  It  became too difficult to wake up every morning and go to work...I had to quit my job.  I WAS SO GLAD I DID! So much less stress on me (and the baby inside me!) and I was able to prepare myself for my new baby.  I am now a stay at home mommy to a beautiful baby boy and LOVE IT! (:<br>  The reason I say to go part time now, just so you can get used to your new schedule before the baby comes- and you can have a bit more time for yourself!  Because when your bundle of joy comes along..there is not much time for yourself anymore.  <br>  Good luck, sweetie! And congrats on the pregnancy! (:
WsUSAgLmaa	Yes....every morning I got up I had to poop, not diarrhea every morning but soon as i got up and moving I had to go, however no vomitting at all!!! I still even have to now and Im 30 weeks!! Take a test!!|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Its just throwing up|`|HuGF2h2Laa	Early signs of pregnancy are: fainting, or feeling dizzy, and brown nipples.<br>  Morning sickness doesn't mean you have to be throwing up. I went through morning sickness without actually throwing up, it's just a general sick feeling.<br>  I don't think you're pregnant.<br>  Have you had unprotected sex? Have you taken sex ed in school??|`|wkd5CMNaaa	You have a stomach bug.|`|7TWAEBleaa	diarrhea and throwing up?? sounds like the stomache flu to me.|`|pu5nyUFCaa	Eww. Idk.<br>  But don't ask US if ur pregnant, get a test done! Do I work at the clinic? NO!<br>  But its only throwing up. Could be pregnancy AND a stomach virus?
cMyPQ90vaa	if i was you i would only take Tylenol that's all i took when i was pregnant and felt sick or had a headache i wouldn't trust anything else but that's my opinion. good luck with your baby.:)|`|uuHPneEcaa	I was sick a few weeks ago.. Robitusin is the best way to go.. i didn't wanna take anything either. but u have to if u wanna get better. then you take.. I only took it twice and my cold was gone. If ur doc told u to take it then u should just do as he or she says.<br>  <br>  I took it.. and my baby is fine. I have been to the doctor since I have been sick, doctors know what u should and shouldnt take while pregnant..<br>  <br>  well do the water and tea and juice. u will get better that way too.. I  have a breathing condition so I took what the doctor told me to do. if it wasn't a good thing for u to take then u doc wouldn't have recominded it|`|i8Ch743Laa	Take your dr's advice. I'm sure if he said it was ok,it's not a problem. Don't worry,and take some robitussin. I have a list my dr gave me,just to help out with situations like this. I take tylenol cold usually,if I'm not feeling good. That works great.|`|4p9sBdyTaa	My best advice is sleep, fluids and rest. If you start to burn a fever then tylenol. You need to be careful with "natural" stuff that contains herbs and what not because some herbs act like medicines and can be just as harmful. I know the idea of taking medicine scares you but the medicines your doctor recommends have been shown to be safe during pregnancy.|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	I was sick about a week ago and had lost my voice. I took Lots and Lots of Vitamin C. I  just drank lots of orange juice (100% pure not concentrated or orange flavored lol). And my fiance bought me Orange Juice Fruit Bars. And I also drank decaffeinated tea before going to bed (some herbals are safe while others aren't I just stuck w/ Cranberry Apple). Take naps when you're tired if your schedule allows. Mine was gone before the week was completely over.<br>  <br>  Also homemade chicken noodle soup w/ fresh chopped garlic...garlic is a natural germ killer.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	So you are going to trust strangers on YA but not your own Dr?<br>  Doesn't seem like a good plan hun. <br>  Take what your Dr tells you, rest and drink lots of water.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	if you don't trust your OB, get a new one.|`|4cfX7AThaa	Pretty much anything you take (including gobs of vit-c) could potentially be bad for your body when pregnant.  A pregnant body is as volatile as it can be.  Pretty much, pay attention to your body, if you are craving something strange, eat it.  Its just your bodies way of telling you what it needs.  Don't over do anything and you'll be fine (including robitusin)|`|35irl04Paa	Honestly, the doctor is the best judge of that. Some doctors are ok with one and some are ok with others. My wifes doctor says that she can take sudafed and tylenol. I would suggest that if you dont want to take anything that you should just try to stay hydrated and get lots of rest. Beef or Chicken boullion is really good for sick people and great for when you are pregnant. Chicken Soup is good too. Also just drink lots of gatorade and water, if you stay hydrated it will be flushed out|`|3lsAXL4vaa	i would take what your dc says is safe to feel better what i did before taking bmed is just googled it or went to webmd.com and asked on there what is safe to take. i have been pregnant twice and they evemn told me to take some benadryl once i know what you mean bout bein scared to take med. but i promise the bb will be ok if you take some med to make you feel better. or tylenol. or just wait it out|`|avkZGv1taa	My recommendation is to take a day off, and take a nap!  Thats all I usually take for a cold or flu :)  I know you will be feeling crummy--but the crummy feelings are not symptoms of the sickness, its symptoms of your body trying to heal itself.  Just keep drinking your OJ, don't get dehydrated, and rest... you will be better soon.|`|AA12396274	you don't say what kind of sick you are but for a cough and sinus, real lemon juice and real honey (not syrup)will help mix it together 2 tsp honey to 1 teaspoon lemon juice,if you are sick at your stomach plain soda crackers will help|`|Cl2nEDtZaa	I can't think of anything off the top of my head maybe try what your doctor suggested|`|HZB0WiCVaa	naw but my granny do
BExscPOtaa	usually 6 weeks is when you'd be able to see the heartbeat on a vaginal ultrasound...and possibly by around 8-9 weeks you could see it on the abdominal one.  the baby is so tiny and it's really hard to pick it up on the abdominal u/s.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i didnt have my first abdominal ultrasound until i was 12 weeks..and i was able to see and hear it<br>  <br>  <br>  i had a vaginal ultrasound at 8 weeks and saw and heard the heartbeat<br>  <br>  i didnt hear the heartbeat on the doppler until 10 weeks|`|HPRlEWu1aa	at 7w5d i saw n heard my babys hearbeat thru transvaginal u/s|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	5 wks is too early to see through abdominal but is visible with vaginal ultrasound. There are a lot of websites you can go to if you want to rent a fetal heart monitor. You will be able to listen to your baby’s heartbeat everyday|`|YzCPY48qaa	i had a vaginal u/sound at 7w 5d and saw a weak fetal h/beat,went back 2 weeks later and had an abdominal u/sound at 9w 5d and saw a lovely strong heartbeat!|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	At my first doctor appointment I was 7 weeks 4 days, and you were able to see the heartbeat through the u/s.  Best of luck to you!|`|dqSA7j7gaa	I saw my sons an d heard it at 6w 4d with a transvaginal ultrasoundmi|`|imIiuaAAaa	I didn't hear mine until I was 12 weeks, but I haven't had an ultrasound yet so I'm not sure if you can hear it earlier with that or not.|`|e33QAXShaa	transvaginal us usually better prior to 9wks. We saw it by abdominal u/s at 6.5wks this pregnancy although we're pretty sure we're a week ahead of what LMP says.
vygYFdsSaa	I was never stupid enough to rely on pulling out as a form of birth control, but many people each year become pregnant when their only b.c. is the "pull out method." You're old enough to be having sex you can spring for some condoms.|`|XSP24wJ7aa	Done it.. An didnt get pregnant but only through luck. You can still get pregnant through it|`|Ehyzno5Faa	NOT!!!!|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Yes you can get pregnant because the penis produces precum which comes out (without him knowing) before he actually cums.<br>  So yes you most definitely can, and many women have had children because of this.  I know my two cousins were conceived like that.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes, it's called the pullout method and it's not a form of birth control. <br>  If you don't know this, then you are tooooo young to be having sex.|`|wNZ95AK3aa	thats a hard question to ans because even though i didnt get preg from doin it but i no a girl that did.its not a safe method.you should use condoms or go on the pill|`|Vq1pCqMuaa	i ahve tried it <br>  and she nt get pregnent but thier is much possibilty of getting pregnant if ur not using precautions one of my friend faced this situation|`|zsWlV2GCaa	yes, you can still end up preg. even if the boy puts on a condom and puts it on wrong and then tries again and gets it right, you could get preg. If the guy cums on his hand and sticks it up there, you can get pregnant. Pulling out is not very effective.Over the course of 1 year, about 27 out of 100 typical couples who rely on withdrawal to prevent pregnancy will have an accidental pregnancy.|`|fqdIVD3Yaa	advice- use a condom.<br>  all of these other girls are right. you can become pregnant by that. <br>  you might get lucky this time, but trust me honey your luck can run out if you keep wanting to try the pulling out method.|`|Cah6nfV5aa	Yes I have tried this method and became pregnant fortunately I"m married and ready for kids. Meaning you should use a condom and birth control or better yet don't have sex.|`|drOXfPM6aa	Yes. You can get pregnant from the pre-*** or if the sperm touched any part of your vagina.|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	yes. a girl can become "pregnet" from that. it's called pre-***...btw-if you can't spell pregnant you probably shouldn't be having sex yet.|`|l3ZNEED1aa	yes you can get pregnant
vygYFdsSaa	Yeah I can see how you'd get that crucial piece of anatomy mixed up.|`|crw44vnRaa	How on earth do you mistake a woman for a man?! Are you certain your pregnant? Have you taken tests to be sure? As for your parents, tell them like it is, you were stupid and have to suffer whatever consequences your parent put upon you. Don't abort though, your mistake could become someone else's biggest dream.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	You should get a life, and then tell your parents that your a troll.|`|C1blHL9vaa	Huh? How does that work?
lLyyuPpvaa	Well if you have to be alone then that is the way it has to be.  I would make sure my bag is packed and loaded in the car, or by the front door depending on how far away the hospital is.  Don't forget to bring something to tape up on the wall as a focus point, hubby's picture, or even a paper plate will help you focus.  The hospital has seen this type of thing before and I'm sure they will have extra people checking up on you to see if you need anything.  If it is financially feasible acquire a Douala, or hire someone to be with you.  Don't be afraid to be a pain.  If you want ice chips then buzz those nurses, they are there for you and your hospital bill will sure show you that they work for you right then...so be a pain....be a burden....you are paying for it, why not :)|`|vygYFdsSaa	Awww try not to worry too much dear. That's terribly unfortunate that hubby might not be there for the birth but it looks like he will be home by your due date so everything should be ok. And if you do happen to go early, I'm SURE your parents will but aside a silly disagreement to go support their daughter during the birth of their grandchild. Some things are more important, you know?? Best wishes to you xx|`|9P26sacKaa	You should really hire a doula.  A doula is a professional childbirth assistant who helps you figure out what your options are and what you want to do during childbirth, comes to your birth and gives you emotional, physical, and informational support, and comes by after you've had your baby to check on you and see if you have any questions or worries and helps you get the resources you need (especially good when you're in a new area).  <br>  <br>  You should definitely have someone with you when you give birth.  Women who birth alone, with just the hospital staff to attend them, have harder births and more interventions, need c-sections more often and need more medication, have more pain, and are typically not as satisfied with their births, have more postpartum depression and a harder time bonding with their babies.  Doulas have been shown to make all of these things better, even when the husband or dad is also present.  In fact, a doula reduces the chances of c-section by 50% even when a dad is present.  <br>  <br>  CAPPA and DONA are the biggest doula organizations and have listings on their web sites of all their doulas.<br>  <a href="http://www.cappa.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.cappa.net</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dona.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dona.org</a><br>  <br>  There are other doula organizations, but these are the two big ones.  I would also call some childbirth educators and see who they recommend as doulas.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Well you won't be alone, you will have your Dr and nurses in there, you will be okay.  <br>  Does your hubby have to leave, or can he wait until after the baby is born?  Can you go with him?
Pf9fyEyQaa	You can't make your cervix dilate.  You can encourage things though.  Drink raspberry leaf tea or take raspberry leaf capsules (not really supposed to induce but it's supposed to help tone your uterus), walk as much as you possibly can, have sex (orgasm causes your uterus to contract and semen contains prostiglandins that can soften your cervix), eat pineapple if you want (you have to eat like 3 or 4 to get enough of the ingredient in it though...I had some, not that much, only because I figured it wouldn't hurt any!), and relax!  They say stress can actually cause labour to start slower and last longer!<br>  <br>  But stay upright for the most part because the baby's head will put pressure on your cervix and hopefully it will dilate.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	have orgasms|`|mVD3TQkFaa	sex and evening primrose oil will help soften the cervix in order to help with dilation and walking can help you dilate and get the baby nice and low. You can insert evening primrose oil capsules vaginally a couple of time daily at least one before bed and it may help. Although I did all these things and more and walked around 2cm and 80% effaced for 3 weeks and went 9 days over my due date so who knows if the baby is ready you can go from 0cm to 10cm in a few hours.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Technically you can't do it yourself... Drugs do that. But you can do some things to help bring along contractions, which open the cervix up. You can try walking, doing squats on birthing balls, sex, nipple stimulation for 1-2 hrs a day (15 minutes per breast), and massage your achilles tendon (back of your ankle above your heel)|`|lLyyuPpvaa	walking is usually the best way, but sex can help too.  My mom said she sped walked up a hill and ate a big pot of red sauce spaghetti and she went into labor about 2 hours later.  Good luck, I know it is uncomfortable for me at 28 weeks, i can only imagine 38 and it is not a pretty picture..hope you pop soon!!!|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	people are impatient.  Just let your pregnancy go naturally and let that baby come out when it's ready.  Don't be impatient, it's better for your baby to arrive at 40 weeks, not 1 1/2 weeks early.|`|3vmynfzpaa	Since you are almost done, there are a few things you can try. Sex is supposed to be one of the best ways because your husbands semen will help to thin out your cervix thus making it dilate quicker. Also walking, red raspberry leaf tea, spicy food, LaborBoost Labor cream and acupressure can all help. Here is a helpful link with more ideas.|`|tcimGBFeaa	I was 42 weeks pregnant with my son and had enough of the waiting, so I took my midwives advice and had my husband "do me" doggy-style and ejaculate in there, orgasm helps too! I was in labor within 2 hours! Oh and by the way, if you are in labor for 24 hours, don't be stubborn and say you don't want pain killers! After that long, it's worth it! ;)
b6pnN8Kqaa	Photo album. Use pics that the baby will recognize like the mom or dad and use soft plastic to cover the photos. Oh, it should be water proof for the saliva cuz the baby will put it in her mouth.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Make a discovery box.<br>  <br>  You can put various items in it(keeping in mind the baby's age). My son loves playing with construction paper, ribbons, leaves, rocks, etc. All, of course, while I'm supervising him.<br>  <br>  This will help her explore new textures as well as colors and shapes of things.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	Take a large piece of felt cloth and glue it to cardboard, then get the alphabet letters/shapes/colors and glue Velcro on the back...you can have the baby try to put the letters/numbers in order, choose the shape/color you are saying etc. make it pretty and colorful but make sure the pieces are large so the baby can't swallow them :)|`|YVpWpg6Saa	I made magnets for our fridge that my daughter still uses (almost 2).  <br>  I made, triangles, squares and circles in primary and secondary colours on the computer.  Printed them, cut the shapes out and used magnetic strips for the back.  Voila...fridge magnets.  I also made the alphabet...but she didn't like those ones near as much.  <br>  You could use different materials as well, like felt, aluminum foil, rubber etc.  That will give them more textures to play with.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	how about a clean empty coffee can or something similar to one...cut a smooth, small hole in the top.  put in a handful of cheerios (something that is safe and edible) and then tape the top back on securely.  let her figure out how to shake it and get the cheerios to come out?|`|J10eYdIAaa	teddy :||`|zFeuSyFYaa	make baby stuff.com lots of great ideas there
z74wSbQoaa	Yes, you can.  Here's an informative site...<br>  <a href="http://www.cytomation.com/info/pre-natal-paternity-test.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cytomation.com/info/pre-natal...</a>|`|Wb1ydezNaa	Amniocentesis (paternity testing while pregnant)<br>  Your doctor can perform a paternity test from an amniocentesis procedure.  This process involves an insertion of a thin fine needle through the mother's belly in order to obtain fluid (about two tablespoons) from the unborn child.  This fluid contains the baby's DNA.  (Possible risks associated with this procedure must be discussed with your doctor/health care provider).|`|4XfjUcvDaa	The only non-harmful test for paternity is to do after the baby is born.  But they can be quite expensive.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	there sure is, contact your doctor but i heard its pretty dangerous. What the rush anyway? It so easy once the baby comes out.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	Yes, but it can be dangerous to the fetus.<br>  Amniocentesis: This test is performed in the second trimester, anywhere from the 14th-20th weeks of pregnancy. During this procedure, the doctor uses ultrasound to guide a thin needle into your uterus, through your abdomen. The needle draws out a small amount of amniotic fluid, which is tested. Risks include a small chance of harming the baby and miscarriage. Other side effects may include cramping, leaking of amniotic fluid, and vaginal bleeding. A doctor's consent is needed to do this procedure for paternity testing. <br>  Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS): This test consists of a thin needle or tube which a doctor inserts from the vagina, through the cervix, guided by an ultrasound, to obtain chorionic villi. Chorionic villi are little finger-like pieces of tissue attached to the wall of the uterus. The chorionic villi and the fetus come from the same fertilized egg, and have the same genetic makeup. This testing can be done earlier in pregnancy from the 10th-13th weeks. A doctor's consent is needed to do this procedure for paternity testing.|`|avkZGv1taa	Technically I'm sure there is some way... but the easiest, safest, most common way is to wait until the child is born to do a blood test.  I would imagine if you are willing to pay a lot of money for the test, they could do something while you were pregnant, since they are able to do genetic screens during pregnancy for at risk mothers--but it would probably be somewhat dangerous, and a doc might not be willing to take the risk.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	They can do an amniocentesis to find out, but it can put you into preterm labor or cause other complications. Honestly, I would wait until the baby is born where they can do a simple DNA test without all the risks.|`|vygYFdsSaa	You can get a DNA test by having an amniocentesis, but its a dangerous procedure.|`|O3CPESX1aa	yep Terri has your answer below me. No Sense me saying the same thing.<br>  The best of luck to you and baby.|`|UZZHJsnmaa	omg i am sorry i dont know i am not sure|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	unfortunately the tests you can do while pregnant can also have a change for the worse and you can lose baby<br>  <br>  wait till after the baby is born|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	they can but its not common .... my sister needed one and the doc made her wait till the baby was born ... its much safer that way!
AA10260497	i would say to do the shower steam and humidifier and just hold and love her, but absolutely do not give her honey like that other person suggested. their immune systems cant handle it until they are 2 yrs old.|`|AA11920812	You`ll notice a big difference after naps and night time with the humidifer. Just make sure its a cool mist. My BIGGEST tip that I just found out with my second:<br>  <br>  Buy vicks baby vapor rub<br>  and apply to the soles of the feet<br>  cover with socks or a sleeper<br>  <br>  I have NO idea why or how this works. But, someone suggest it to me on here with my 18 month old when he was sick. And, couldn`t take the children`s cold medicines yet. I could not believe it. He didn`t wake up ONCE with a cough. Shocked I decided to try it on my 2 year old and it worked with him. Although I think he liked the application the best (he loves to be tickled).|`|iOSEVRPPaa	When you give her a bath, run the shower on it's hottest to make the room steamy.  This will help with congestion.  Be sure and keep her in the bathroom in the steam for 5 to 10 minutes.  Do it at least every other night till she's better.|`|hZ7AfJPSaa	The showers work for the congestion.  When my son was that little and he started getting like that I always put him in the bathroom with me or daddy or while he was bathing to sit in the steam for a few minutes.<br>  <br>  As far as a cough though there isn't really much you can do for a baby at 6 weeks sadly.  Just sooth her.  If you think it is getting really bad call the doctor but she could just have a cold it is the season.<br>  <br>  Hope she feels better.  Poor baby.  It hurts us more then it hurts our children =[|`|bpM1zctZaa	please do not use honey .. it can be poison to such a young child.  it's because their little body cannot digest the honey.  my mother has been a LPN for 10 years and my sister is a RN and my children's PED has told me the EXACT same thing.  Unfortunately there is not much you can do.  If your baby gets worse take him/her back to the Ped to get rechecked it could turn into to something more ... you can also ask them to run a quick check for RSV.  that is very dangerous for babies.  (CAN BE DEADLY)  A lot of Docs won't check for it if the child just seems to have a cold.  My daughter had it several times without the sound in her chest.  We caught it just in time.  GOOD LUCK andI hope all the best for you and your family.|`|39qec43kaa	My son is also congested and has a cough, our doctor told us to prop him up while he sleeps, putting a pillow or small blankets under the top part of their mattress helps.

5yAsj29Vaa	Yes, you could be pregnant.  When I started the pill at 13 y/o and then again in November after my 6 week checkup, my Dr. told me the pill wasn't fully effective until 3 months after starting it.  That's if it's taken correctly.  If you miss a pill, you're supposed to take 2 a day, one in the morning, one in the evening, until you're caught up, you don't take all the missed pills at once. <br>  You should continue your pill, as directed.  Your cycle may be off for a while since you are just starting the pill, so if your period is late, that doesn't necessarily mean you are pregnant.  I'd wait and see, and if it's more than a week late, take a test.|`|FIxo73Mdaa	There is only about a 3 day time span you have to become pregnant each month.  If you missed your pill when you were fertile and ovulating then you have a chance of being pregnant.  The only way to know is to take a test, and a test won't be positive until around the time your period is due.
vygYFdsSaa	Yes there is a chance of that; however, taking yourself off birth control can make your periods irregular for a little while.|`|uuHPneEcaa	yeah or maybe ur period is acting up because u got off ur birth control. I am sure if u go to the doctor and they can give u one (where they take blood)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It is possible that you just tested too early or that you can't get a positive hpt and you need to go get a blood test instead. It is also possible that your body is just getting used to being off the pill and it's messing up your cycle. Good luck!|`|u1DDrXO2aa	Yes there could be a chance last jan 5 i had a period  i got pregnant and took a test feb 15 when i had no period and it was positive....so you may not be pregnant but you also could be so i suggest seeing a doctor.
7twBDGcCaa	I gave my daughter frozen waffles.  I cut them it to 4 triangles and it helped!

This lasts for 1-2 weeks and then he's back to "normal". Keep offering the food throughout the day but don't push it. Once the teething pain subsides(usually when the tooth breaks through the gum) then he should pick up eating again.|`|2I5D78Sbaa	its because hes teething, he wants the bottle because he get to bite on it, he'll get nutrients from the bottle and once the teeth come through he'll be hungry again.<br>  try something cool like a freeze pop or something for him to bite one and orajel.|`|XwrBUxIXaa	Try frozen waffels.

mCDopsLEaa	Of course. It isn't suggested to wear heals because of balance. But if your a pro you wont have any problems.|`|hOWNwpCLaa	I think it's fine, until you getting your baby belly, because then it becomes much easier to lose your balance, and you don't want to fall and hurt the baby.  I'm 23 weeks, and have only recently stopped wearing heals.  At 14 weeks, you should be just fine.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Wearing heels obviously won't cause you to miscarry.  However, it can cause you some pretty nasty back pain or result in a nasty spill since your balance may be off during pregnancy.  I refrained from wearing heels my entire pregnancy.  I had a couple pairs of naturalizer flats that I absolutely loved for nights out while pregnant!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	There's nothing wrong with wearing heals, it won't hurt anything. The only reason they advise to limit their use is because as you get bigger you get clumsier. Since you are only 14 weeks along, you are probably not carrying around a big huge belly that can throw you off balance so it's fine to wear them. Have fun tonight! Tell your hubby to have a drink for you and all of us other mommies-to-be! :)|`|6L9jJnchaa	Yeah, just be careful that you don't trip and fall.  That's the only risk, really.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	Yes!

z6IekuwSaa	Your milk supply is not going to be much harder to keep when pumping. It is just actually making yourself pump that is hard. It isn't really how long you pump, or how much time goes by in between pumps that matters that much. What matters is how many times you pump a day. Shoot for 10 times a day, but don't be upset if you only do 8. The best times to pump are 1am-5am. You make the most milk during those times. So try to squeeze in at least one pumping during those times. You are going to have to empty your breasts completely. Then when the milk stops flowing pump until it starts again. If you do that then in 2 days your milk supply will increase. I'm an exclusive pumper. I have been for 4 months. My schedule is 1am pump 4 am put her on a boppy pillow and feed her while I pump at the same time. 7 am pump 8:30am pump 11am pump 2pm pump 3pm pump 8 pm pump. I'm not that rigid about the times, but that's the general idea. sometimes I sneak another pumping in at 10pm if I'm up. If she is awake just sit her on a boppy in front of you while you pump. Also to save time it is perfectly ok to only sanatize your flanges and stuff once a day. But you have to keep them in the fridge between pumpings. I just keep mine in the fridge all day wiping them with water before I use and then boiling them at night (or dishwasher). You are going to have a tough road ahead but it is completely do able. And very rewarding. Also, that was my schedule at the beginning. At 3 months I now only have to pump between 4 and 5 times a day. I pump generally 50 ounces a day which is more than enough. It's just that you have to establish a milk supply before you can back off pumpings. And if you ever notice your milk supply dropping just do a pump-a-thon and pump like crazy for a day or two and in a couple days your body makes more.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, pumping IS breastfeeding, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Just ask an LC they'll tell you. And to everyone who says just let her nurse it's easier. Of course it is, but sometimes we don't have that option and breastmilk is best, so we suffer through and make sure we get it to our child.|`|H1zS1enMaa	the more u pump the more supply u will have and i think brestfeeding is a great experience for u and the baby i dont understand why u pump.<br>  plus u need to eat more nutricious foods to boost up ur milk. <br>  Good luck!|`|iPQqPkhTaa	why arent you just nursing her?|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Unless you have a reason not to nurse directly you should get your baby to nurse directly.

If you truly want to pump and bottlefeed, then you need to be pumping about 8x per day in order to get and keep your supply up at this point.  Newborns usually nurse 8-12x per day, and they only take in 1-3oz. per feeding.<br>  <br>  Is there a reason you're not putting your baby to the breast?  That would make things much easier for you in the long run.  You can still offer bottles of expressed milk from time to time and breastfeed when you're together.  That would help your supply stay up and minimize the time that you're pumping and washing bottles, etc.  <br>  <br>  I'd definitely contact a lactation consultant to review your situation and see what other changes you can make to ensure that you will be able to continue to provide enough breastmilk for your daughter.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|KmC0K59taa	Are you not letting her nurse from your breast?  You need to let her nurse from one and pump from the other.  <br>  <br>  Milk is produced on a supply and demand basis.  The more milk that is being taken out, the more milk will be made to replace it.<br>  <br>  Milk is more effectively taken out by your baby than by a pump.  I never had great results with a pump, but my baby always got plenty directly from my breast.  If you are serious about breastfeeding, then let her nurse from you.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are not wanting her to nurse, then you need to be pumping every 2 hrs.  That's how often she would be needing milk from you.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	Your milk supply will be much harder to keep if you aren't truly breastfeeding and just pumping.<br>  <br>  You will just have to pump more and make sure you are eating and drinking enough.<br>  <br>  Why don't you give her your breast?  It will be hard to keep this up for much longer.  And it takes SO much time!  Breastfeeding is so easy and there's no mess.|`|AgPDg010aa	Go to a health food store and pick up some fenu greek and mother's milk tea. That should help boost your supply up. Also try eating oatmeal in the morning. Are you only pumping 3 times a day? You need to be pumping more if you want your supply to go up. Your body produces milk as you need it and so if you are only pumping 3x a day your body thinks your baby doesn't need as much milk. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	1st, you gotta breastfeed, If you don't the milk will dry up, you can supplement with formula until it goes back up, and my doula says that after breastfeeding try pumping the same breast to stimulate more milk production.
iOSEVRPPaa	Let her throw the fit and do what you need to do.  There are times you will have to make hard decisions like this for your child, but you are the parents and you knkow best.  Just put her in a bouncy and take care of some things.  Do it just for a few minutes and then slowly work up to where she can handle it for more time.<br>  <br>  Be sure and keep her entertained when you put her down.  Talk to her, sing to her, give her a toy.|`|yB5go5wbaa	Sounds like she just loves her mommy and daddy.  She's too young to be "manipulating" you; she just doesn't quite get that when you put her down and go away, that you're coming back.  Try putting her down and then doing what you need to do while she can see you.  If you've got to do something in the kitchen, put her in her high chair and talk to her and let her know you're there. Work up to leaving for a little bit at a time and coming back and holding her when you're done.  She's having a bit of separation anxiety, but she'll learn soon that you're coming back for her.  Good luck.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	I know this isn't the best answer but i think you should enjoy every minute of her wanting you to hold her. In just a few short years she will be interested in boys and wanting nothing to do with her parents. Love EVERY minute!!|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Put her down more, so she gets used to it.  Also, learn behavioural psychology, so you don't face lots of similar battles in future.<br>  <br>  p.s.: do NOT "keep her busy" when you're teaching her this.  The point is to teach her to behave, not to teach her that life is all about her having non-stop fun.  Teach her that, and your life will be hell.|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	She has you well trained, doesn't she?  Try putting her down and going away. Come back as soon as she is quiet. <br>  Try to do this as often as you can.  She will learn that she gets what she wants by quiet and patience.  At least, that's the goal.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	First, it's normal that she wants to be held.  She has obviously just reached a point where she realizes who you and her dad really are, and she wants to be with you all the time.  She was in you for 9 months, and it takes about 9 months before some babies are really adjusted to the outside world.  (That doesn't meant that 9-month-olds don't want to be held a lot either, but I have noticed a change around that age with my kids.)<br>  <br>  There's a lot of developmental stuff that goes on at 4 months that we can't really see, but it's there (as evidenced by her sudden clinginess).  The best thing you can do is to keep comforting her and reassuring her, and this phase will eventually pass.<br>  <br>  That being said, you obviously have to be able to go to the bathroom and get dressed, and there may be times that she needs to fuss/cry for a couple minutes.  Put her where she can see you, and do what you need to do quickly and calmly.  Talk reassuringly to her, and touch her often to let her know that you will be right back.<br>  <br>  When she's rested and in a good mood, you can try to put her down on the floor (or in a swing, bouncy seat, etc.), and play with her while sitting next to her.  If she stays happy, try stepping away for just a second to grab something and come right back.  After a while, try grabbing something quickly from another room, and again, come right back.  If she gets anxious, talk to her while she can't see you.  This will help teach her that you will always come right back.  <br>  <br>  Remember, too, that babies at this age don't understand things they can't see, and they have no concept of time.  If she can't see you, she's terrified b/c she doesn't know where you are or when you'll be back.  <br>  <br>  As for doing other things (cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc.), I recommend finding a good sling to carry her around in if you don't have one already.  She'll be happy because she's close to you, but you'll have your hands free to do other things.  I can't say enough good things about my Mei Tai carrier, so that's my recommendation.  :-)<br>  <br>  And for what it's worth, a clingy baby does not necessarily turn into a clingy toddler.  Kids' personalities vary, and their needs can change over time.  My oldest was a super-shy, clingy baby up until about a year old, and she gradually got more and more confident and outgoing.  Shortly after her 3rd birthday, she started preschool 2 days per week, and she went in with no trouble at all, not a single complaint or tear.  I never would have guessed that that was the same child.  <br>  <br>  My younger two kids were also very clingy babies, and I held them a ton.  I barely put my youngest down for the first 6 months of his life.  He's now 18 months old and is running everywhere and plays fine with his sisters and other trusted adults/kids.  He still wants to be cuddled/nursed a lot when he's with me, but he separates just fine, too.<br>  <br>  You're doing a great job, mama, and this, too, shall pass.|`|3jzqG7Oqaa	I work in a daycare and see this all the time. Your child will turn out to possibly be a spoiled brat. What you need to just put the kid down and let her scream, sooner or later she will realize that she can't get her way all the time, and you have other stuff to do, like clean and make dinner. Sit her in a chair or a swing. And give her a toy, or put some calming music on. I see kids like this all the time and there parents always give in and hold them, they are very unpleasant children to be around. Sorry for being brutely honest, but don't let it get worse.|`|3lsAXL4vaa	it is normal if you never put her down. i have 2 kids my son is 9 months old and i am sur eto let him spend time on the floor on his mat by himself or in his swing or just in his crib for a bit watching his mobile. he lets me do whateve i need to do...shower, clean, get dressed, etc.  the only way to get past this is put her down on her play mat or something of that nature and lettin her cry, of course not cryin so bad she will get sick or anything. but she will be fine she needs to learn she will be ok without you for a little but on the floor, swing, etc.|`|ADEDkCgOaa	she is spoiled to holding. just put her down and let her throw her fit then once she starts to calm down a  little bit pick her up to get her all the way calm. my sister held her baby a lot and he is 18 months old and STILL throws fits when she isnt holding him. but she wont just let him cry. your baby wont get hurt by just crying. no harm will come from crying except your heart will hurt. i dont hold my kids all the time and they are fine with other people holding them.just put her down and let her cry. soon she wont want to be held all the time and you will be able to go to the bathroom alone. i am also a stay at home mom and so is my sister. just because you are home all the time doesnt mean you have to hold her or give her 100% of your attention.|`|35irl04Paa	My child was the same way. Sometimes he still gets where he wants to be around us all the time. Hes 20 months. This will pass. Try keeping her busy and putting a toy in each room. for example, a swing in the bedroom, jumperoo or walker in livingroom bouncy seat in bathroom. It worked for us.|`|ypnWDDB8aa	Ignore her and put the hoover on. Pay no attention.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	If you watch super nanny you would know that you just need to put her down and let her cry.  It isn't healthy for her well being.  It is tough,  but you need to do it and be consistent with it & it will get better|`|JE8lRn7Caa	she is spoiled let her cry for awhile make sure she isnt wet or hungry nad just put her in her bed and let her cry it sounds mean but its the only way you will be able to get anything done
1G3XPiq3aa	I got a lop eared bunny instead. My daughter was the same and after getting the bunny would just crawl around slowly behind bunny starring at her, whether we were in the house or backyard. Probably not helpful but yeah...|`|n6XYYyoLaa	we bought the chicco discovery; it seemed the sturdiest of all we examined at the store, and it comes with things like a bassinet and nightlight, changing table, etc; but we mainly bought it bc it was sturdy, nicest mattress, washable in machine instead of wipe clean...etc...it's been wonderful, we have a almost 9 mo dd who has used it to sleep in every night and it has held up so far marvelously; it's a good size, yet i can roll it through our house's doorways carefully without folding it down....i highly recommend it! i like chicco products, they always seemed to be good quality....<br>  it also has a  play bar where you can take the pad out and put the toy bar up for baby if you want, <br>  here's a link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2983691" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|taQFWXuHaa	well i bought an eddie Bauer play yard but idk if it would really be relevant bc im 7 months pregnant and well your daughter is 8 months old.

Oz4iblUEaa	I have 3 adopted children with adhd AND NO THEY SHOULD NOT CASH IN ON IT! I FEEL THE ONLY WAY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO IS IF THE ILLNESS CAUSES ONE PARENT TO HAVE TO STAY HOME BECAUSE THE CHILD NEEDS A PARENT AT ALL TIMES!  and ADHD is not that case and trust me one of my sons have server caseof ADHD and yes I have to work with the school and take him to appointments but aint that what every parents does? Like my cousin has cancer so yes his parents get it but that is because my aunt quit her job to be at the hospital and things with her child so that is ALOT different! You are not sitting in the hospital with no did all the time just cause they are ADHD! It is time people quit having kids if they dont want to work to support them! I am all for help to people who really need it. but these parents who get 2,000 a month in ssi and nothin goes to the kid is sick..it is like they use the children for their ticket through life!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	ADHD is not a disease that warrants a check.

This is my opinion and I already know I will receive some thumbs down for it.<br>  No, I do not think that they should be getting disability for being a kid.

Its hard to think about losing someone cause it was so painful.  You need to talk to him about it and not come on here venting...its gonna do you no good.  And if he's a good loving parent to the kid that is alive then yes i consider him a loving parent.  You cant be a parent to a kid that is dead but you can always remember them and it is forever inked onto him as you said.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	That's really judgmental. You have no idea what this person is thinking. People handle grief differently. You are judging this person on your own patterns. That's not right. You don't know because you only know what you see and what this person tells you. There is more. We all have our secrets, don't we?|`|AA10478980	I'm not exactly sure what you are asking, but the living child is the important one.  There is nothing you can do for a child who is no longer living.  You show love to the living.|`|WPI0Z47saa	There isn't enough information that you wrote to eve give an opinion on. Need more details or examples.|`|DsgNMpEsaa	He's probably handling his grief as best he can.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I don't think that he has forgotten he has just moved on and now he's got a new child and it kinda makes you feel better because a new baby makes you feel great, He will not ever forget his daughter it's not that he's gotten over it because you never really get over it but he has moved on, she still lives in his heart but he knows there is no way to bring her back. Now he is ready to focus on this one you can't just not love the new child because you lost another child, again life still always goes on and you have your good days and your bad days, like her birthday probably won't be a great day for you or even the day she passed away. But some good and some bad you can always have a memory that will just make you smile and sure make you miss her but your still thinking of her in your own way and that's all that counts in rough times. Eventually with time you'll start to see that this is what happens why does it happen know body knows I used to believe because god had a plan for everyone but how can he take something away that you loved so dearly it's just not fair but you learn by that. Again like I always say keep your head up kid better things are soon to come. K. Have a good day. Hope the baby gets stronger. <br>  <br>  ***hugs****|`|a4bd96dcb7b6c4b2e1b26176b088b451aa	I really don't think he has forgotten your lost baby but I just believe that he probably has a harder time dealing with the fact that he will never see her again.  Some people have a harder time dealing with losing people and think that by just forgetting about that person and avoiding any conversations about that person will make it better to deal with.  So I would just suggest that you ask your husband about exactly how it feels and try to compromise and respect the way he feels I am sure he loved the child.|`|AA11071252	You are going through a very difficult time right now, recovering from a difficult pregnancy, childbirth, surgery, and dealing with your baby being in intensive care instead of home with you.  On top of this, a painful anniversary is coming up and causing you additional emotional upset.  No wonder you're questioning your husband's emotions.  You have enough going on inside of you for everyone!<br>  <br>  I'll bet that he IS relieved to have another baby to distract you all from the sadness you've had to deal with. You should be as well.  You are entitled to happiness.  This doesn't mean any of you will ever forget your little girl but you can and should let go of the pain with time.  There will always be an empty spot in your hearts for her but you needn't walk around with that constantly effecting your life.  If you can't "let go", nor allow your husband to deal with his grief the way he needs to, perhaps you should get some counseling.  You seem to need an outlet right now since you're posting here so frequently.  I think more personal and professional help might be beneficial to help you sort out and get through these challenging times.  It certainly couldn't hurt.  <br>  <br>  Please don't be embarrassed or hesitant to consult a counselor.  They can be like a best friend if you find the right one.  <br>  <br>  I remember before my second baby was born that I didn't know if I could ever love him as much as his brother.  You may be going through some similar emotions, besides dealing with the guilt of her being gone.  I'll bet that once your son is home with you things will improve.  Right now you probably don't even feel like a new mom.  This is typical of parents with babies in NICU.  It is so different than you expected and planned.  Please try to have faith that things will improve each day.  A few months from now this will all be behind you and, hopefully, you will all be feeling much happier.  <br>  <br>  Blessings to you!|`|UR9BX77haa	What makes you think he's forgotten her? You don't know what goes on inside someones head. <br>  We lost a baby at 12 weeks pregnant recently and were devastated, I talked non stop about it and now I am struggling to mention it, I act like nothing happened because its too painful to keep reliving it, some people can't believe how quick I bounced back and have tried to make my life positive filling it with lots of activity. The reason why I do millions of things since then s because when my minds busy I don't have time to dwell on it & be upset because in reality I have found it too difficult to come to terms with so I almost ignore it. <br>  I think your man is probably in the same boat and has found it more painful than you give him credit for.|`|bwlDJdtdaa	i think that this person is dealing with grief in his own way. I don't think anybody can forget a child. Maybe this person is just finding it hard to talk about the deceased.|`|RLoilwCNaa	I would say they care a ton and that they are trying to forget to stop the pain. It's a natural defense to painful thoughts.

If my daughter died I certainly wouldn't want to talk about it. It would be too painful.|`|KHZLPldraa	I think that maybe you are assuming that he has forgotten her, but I assure you that no daddy nor mommy will ever forget a child they have lost.  Me and my hubby do not always talk about Garrett but we have never forgotten him.  just because your husband doesn't deal with it the same way that you do doesn't mean he didn't love her as much or that he has forgotten her is a little harsh and unfair.  When Garrett first past I couldn't hardly bring his name out of my mouth but my husband talked about him no stop and it bothered me because it tore me up to speak of him.  Didn't mean that I forgot him just that I was grieving differently than my husband.  PS.  And I wasnt relieved when I had another child I was more blessed.|`|lzivF4Idaa	sometimes thinking about things hurt too much. even though im not always speaking about my sons CF or being depressed about it its usually on my mind A LOT and usually depresses me A LOT. i try not to show i though.|`|AA11280073	It is not healthy to dwell on a loved one who died.

uFrqC4Y2aa	Too early to tell. You usually won't get all those symptoms so soon after getting pregnant. All you can do is wait and see if you get your period; you wouldn't get an accurate result by now from a test.|`|BNcExYEeaa	those sound a lot like pregnancy but have u been throwing up that's also one of the first signs|`|haabfMtkaa	Take the test it cant hurt. If you are there will be some hormones in your pee. Try to take it in the morning the first time you pee in the morning. Even if there is a little faded hardly there positive then you prego. That is what happen with me. I took the test before I even missed my monthly but I got a faint positive line and sure enough I was pregnant again. I will tell you what though it sure makes for a long 9 &1/2 months though. I found out like three weeks after we conceived and it felt like I was pregnant forever.|`|OApLnJrsaa	You could be, but all of those could also be signs of getting your period too.<br>  I'd say to wait a few more days then take one of those early detection tests.

She can contact local funeral homes and see if any of them can put her in contact with organizations who can assist her.  There are usually churches available to help as well an community groups who may be willing.  The funeral home may also be able to work out a payment plan.  If he died in the hospital than there is usually a social worker who works with the family and he/she should also have resources for this situation.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Cremation is cheap.

uP08b6K4aa	My advice to you, is to work really hard at school, go to University and get your degree (and then obviously a job at a practice), THEN think about children.<br>  <br>  As long as you ensure you have the savings behind you to firstly take the time off you need in the babys' first year whilst on maternity, then if you need to continue with your career part-time, that you have put enough aside given that your wages will decrease.<br>  <br>  There is no reason whatsoever that you can't pursue a valuable career in law AND have children, you'll just need to juggle things about a bit to make sure it's what works for you and the family.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|lBw50ySpaa	One thing about getting a college degree and good career is that it gives you more flexibility.  Number one, you will make enough money to save.  That way when the time comes and you want time off, you can.  Also, you will probably be able to find work while you are home with the baby, since you will have connections in the field.  <br>  Go for it, and good luck.|`|claUGpVRaa	Why would being a solicitor differ to any other job?  You still get maternity rights whatever job, so why not?|`|0qP8gLpyaa	why wouldn't you? <br>  Just because you want to have a job doesn't mean you can't be a parent.|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	yes you can work part time|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Of course you will be able to have kids.  A lot of people have demanding jobs yet still manage to raise a family.  You will just have to learn to juggle your responsibilities.
1dEAWAUMaa	starve him until he'll eat !!<br>  no, don't do that, really.<br>  <br>  if he likes eggs, maybe make him a plain omelet one day, if he likes that, try adding things like peppers, mushrooms, other vegetables. you could put ham in it to make it more nutritious, too. <br>  <br>  just try gradually combining things into foods he already likes. <br>  <br>  if he wants fries, make some mccain ones in the oven, and if you have time- cut up some yams into fries, and bake those. i'm guessing, since he's little, he'll cover them in ketchup anyways, he probably won't notice the difference. then, he has a new food he can eat, possibly in other forms? if that goes well, you can cube and boil them, and maybe mix some carrots in? same color, he'd probably at least try them.<br>  <br>  be creative, i'm sorry i couldn't be of more help, but it's a long process getting kids to try new foods, many kids are much worse than yours!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	Eventually, kids get hungry. They won't actually starve themselves. Sit him down and feed him what you're eating. Institute the one bite rule - he HAS to try one bite of everything before he leaves the table - and stick to it. If it means he sits there for an hour after everyone else has finished eating, so be it. <br>  <br>  Kids can't hold out long - they'll eat it, because they are getting nothing else. It sounds harsh, I know, but I promise it wouldn't hurt him. Let him have his normal breakfast and try it at lunch, or a normal lunch and try it at dinner - this way you know he IS eating, but force him to branch out at one meal a day.|`|kuHE3z2Maa	My son was the same way until I started letting him eat off my plate at dinner time. I guess the food is more exciting that way.  Give it a try and hopefully it will work for you too.|`|0b1376ab6d109d97abb0d0a38fa2232caa	I have the same problem with my 3 yr old.

However when a child is in my setting I never seem to have a problem with a child not eating. I think it is because all the children and myself are all eating together and all eating the same thing. So my thought is try eating meals with your child at the dining table. If you son see's you eating more than likely he will want to be just like daddy and eat what your eating. Another thing he is getting protein, calcium, carbs with the things he is eating which is a great thing. Try giving him chocolate milk. Good luck to you and if this continues to concern you take him to his doctor. One thing you do not talk about is his weight. <br>  Keep up being a good daddy and remember your son wants to eat things he sees you eat!
WPI0Z47saa	I have been a stay at home mom for 3 years now and I know how you feel. I was depressed and saw a doctor for it. He recommended my joining my local YMCA and it helped so much. I signed my son up for little classes, they have them for all ages even that young, so I felt like he was getting some enjoyment. Then we would do swimming together which was pretty fun. Then I joined a couple of classes for myself. My husband would sometime watch him since they offer classes all day even at night and on weekends and if he couldn't watch him, with being a member you get 2 hours of free babysitting a day since they have a daycare and nursery on site. It helped me break up my day and also helped teach my son some independence so that he didn't always cling to me. I would strongly recommend looking into this. It really was a lifesafer and everyone gains a little bit from the experience. It definitely made me feel like I was a better mom after feeling like I was failing for so long. You can also check out your local MOMS CLUB and they have playgroups for the kids and mothers get to sit and actually chat with other adults. Hope this helped. Good luck.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	My daughter is 14 months old and attached at my hip. Her ideal day would be to play with me all day, sleep next to me, etc. But I still get stuff done.<br>  <br>  When I clean the kitchen she comes to help. I got a 4 pack of plastic cups and bowls for $1 each at the dollar store. When I do dishes, she plays with her dishes. When I cook dinner she gets a box of noodles to shake and a pot and spoon to cook with. When I fold laundry she unfolds the socks and plays with them. When I mop the floor she sits in her high chair and cries, but that's too bad, she can't play in the floor cleaning solution. :p<br>  <br>  When I do the bills she colors with her crayons. When I clean the bathroom she cleans her toddler potty with a tissue. (It is sterile, she's never used it, we just have it so she can get used to it being there)<br>  <br>  It sounds like your baby just wants to do everything you do and be by you all day. So give her something to do so she can copy you. She's old enough to start copying. And try to find an activity she likes to do that will distract her if she gets up. Clap your hands. Wave hi. Things like that. They are great for stopping a tantrum before it starts.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You gotta force her to play on her own. You can't spoil her by holding her all the time. You'll never get any time to yourself if you don't teach her to play alone for a while each day. At first she may cry but after a few days she will get used to it.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It will get better when she is busy cruising and walking, and perhaps that is what she is working on right now.   Ignore the crap around the house, do what needs to be done and leave the rest, your daughter is this little only for a little time and you have the luxury of enjoying her.   You do need to get out of the house and see other moms, to check in with them and talk about what works, what doesn't, what is hard and what is easy.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	this to shall pass we all go thought it with babies that age , believe me my girl is hanging on my legs now .. wait she ran off lol <br>  it relaly does get easier soon. my girl is 21 months and i can do stufff now about 13 months it seems to get better. i remember if i walked down the hall to pee she would cry . ahhh . now we are having another in may starting all over :) <br>  hang in|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i'm sorry you're going through this. sounds like you just have a "high needs' baby. i know at 10 mons shes probably pretty heavy, but is there any way you could put her in a  sling or carrier and do housework go to the bathroom etc like that?<br>  does she crawl yet? does she like to crawl?<br>  sounds like she also has separation anxiety which will pass.<br>  <br>  just remember this won't last forever. It may seem like it will, but soon shell be 2, 3 yrs old and want to do other things. Also, then shell go to kindergarten, etc. they grow up fast Ive heard and i believe it. I just try to tell myself that too when my daughter and I have days like that. I tell myself "she wont be a baby forever, let me try to enjoy this as much as possible" though i know it's hard to enjoy the baby phase when you cant do anything else besides hold her.<br>  <br>  Is there anybody who can watch your baby for awhile? while you go out and take a 'breather" ? like go to the movies by yourself or with a friend, get your haircut, or mani/pedi, sit at starbucks, walk in the park, anything to help you clear your head? or what about they take your baby out so you can do some housework?<br>  like her grandma or aunt or something?<br>  <br>  also, what about taking her out for walks in the park? that would be nice and a relief, for both you and her. maybe shes bored. sometimes when babies get bored they act really clingy and want to be held all the time. maybe shes going stir crazy so some fresh air would do you both justice. I know when if eel caved in going to the park always revives me and her.<br>  <br>  one more suggestion is this book called "the happiest baby on the block" i think it's written by this guy named dr.sears who specializes in "high needs babies" (aka really clingy babies)|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Sounds like mommy needs a break!

Have you thought of taking her out to a playgroup so that she can interact and you can interact with other moms?|`|1S7uXsInaa	That is the age.  My son is 11 months and we are slowly working our way out of that phase. . .it is exhausting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There were many weeks that I vacuumed with one hand and held him with the other.  My daughter was never like that so I could not understand why he was.  The only comfort I can give you is that it will get better.  On my days off I just hand him over to my husband when he gets home to get a break for a little while to regain my sanity.|`|AA10478980	You need to talk to someone in real life about this - your mom, the baby's dad, his mom, your sister, a friend, anyone who can help you sort this out.  Maybe one of them can come over a couple of times a week to babysit so you can go out or do something on your own.  Babies are very demanding - they can't help it since they have to depend on you for everything.  But it would be really good for your daughter if you encouraged her to be more independent in terms of playing on the floor for a little while, for example.  What you are feeling is common, so don't feel bad about it - just do something about it.  It will be good for both of you to have a little time away from each other.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	sorry but thats pretty much the life of a stay at home mom.  do you have any friends with kids, or relatives close by.  check into a moms club or mommy and me play group.  just getting out of the house and being with other moms to talk about stuff really makes a difference for me.  Also occasionally i will have a friend or relative keep my daughter for an hour or two and run errands or go get a haircut alone in order to have some time to myself.  unfortunaly your days of hanging out wathcing tv are over, thats part of being a mom, but you can still do things to get out and get some time off.|`|ZNTLSCLhaa	I'm sure you have thought of this, but do you have family members or friends that can take her out for a couple of hours a couple of times a week so you can get caught up on what you need to do and have a little bit of time to yourself?  Maybe have a sitter come over every other saturday night and have a girls night out?  <br>  <br>  It's important that you find a little bit of you time before you become so stressed out that you end up taking it out on your daughter.  I don't mean you would be violent in any way, but you don't want to start resenting her.  You want to maintain the bond you have and the way to do that in a healthy way is to FIND time for you.<br>  <br>  Edit:  What's up with some of the posters acting like she brought this on herself by getting pregnant?  Umm Hello!  She is just frustrated at the moment as all parents get at some points or another.  She understands that parenting isn't always a ray of sunshine.  She just wants a little feedback. Nothing wrong with that!  Lay off.  Bring on the thumbs down for standing up for mothers that are real and understand that parenting is a tough job.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but Tink... you need to come out of tv land.  It's obvious you are not a parent.|`|cDVAEHgCaa	I know the feeling!!!  At least once a week, I get in that "I can't handle this anymore" mode of thinking.  I'm a single mom with no support from the father.  I have no car, so getting groceries is a big chore.  The laundry never ends. My baby wants me to play with her 24/7.  When she goes to bed, I still don't get a break because she wakes up frequently.  I haven't had a good night's rest in 8 months...<br>  <br>  You NEED to get a break.  Can your family watch her for a couple of hours once a week, so you can do something for YOU?|`|dXMdt3gVaa	I stayed at home with my first daughter until she was 7 months old and then I had to go back to work and I totally empathise with you, because my daughter was exactly the same, very clingy. She then went to an in home daycare (which I must say she LOVES the lady who ran the daycare) and she started to interact more with other children and she became a lot less clingy and needy. I was also happier because I became more than just the mommy lady. I had my career, my own money, and then when I was with her, it really was quality time. <br>  <br>  Just dont beat yourself up. Just acknowledge youre frustrated and maybe talk to your significant other about putting her in a mornings only playgroup or something so you can go and be more of the person that you used to be? <br>  <br>  Its okay to still look after your needs as a person and her needs as a baby. If you keep up like this youre going to be so unhappy. Some moms just thrive at home, me personally, I would be climbing the walls. I see the other moms in my subdivision staying home and being wonder mom all day and I just cant do it. I need to have something else stimulating me. And I think I still am  pretty good mom. I know I certainly am a HAPPY mom and that makes all the difference to my kids and hubby.|`|paHbLR9aaa	That doesn't make you a bad mother, at all.  My daughter will be 2 in June, and I have recently become a stay at home mom.  She was just like that at first.  She always wanted to be right under me.  I put her on a schedule, but it's not very strict, and we do get off track at times.  But now I have time to clean the house and a little time to relax, too.  When we get up in the AM we have breakfast, play a little, maybe watch some cartoons.  After lunch, I put her in bed and read her a story, when I'm done reading I close her bedroom door.  And when she cries, I don't give in.  I take advantage of my time, and clean.  Once she is up from her nap we play and go for walks and such.  Put your daughter in her playpen with some toys and a cup of juice or whatever.  If she cries, leave her there, unless there is something really wrong with her.  Try to make it a daily routine, she'll get use to it and know what to expect next.  You'll be fine.|`|3yyckJIvaa	You need endurance. Put her in a crib or somewhere she can't get out of and leave her there for 1-2 hours everyday (around "Nap time"). No matter how much she screams, just keep her in there. Do the same thing with her playpen. It might take a few months, or a few weeks, but just ignore her screaming, and leave her there. Become a tough-loving mother. Stop paying attention to her 24/7. :)|`|mvqfIjEVaa	You're not a bad mom!  This stuff gets really overwhelming.  Is there someone who can come and give you a hand, you mom or mother-in-law?  Or even just a friend to play with the baby so you can get some stuff done around the house?  It'll also keep you from feeling so isolated.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	It's understandable. At some point every mom feels like a bad mom.|`|O5KOwhovaa	She'll grow out of it in a year or so.|`|RMgJwhcsaa	Try giving her a distraction, like a childrens' TV show|`|4HFmQSrzaa	Kids can be exhausting, especially in that 'clingy' phase. Mine gave up naps by 8 months, and were up for 12 hrs + each day -- all of 'em! It made me feel a little crazy at points. ;)<br>  I read a few of the replies, and you did get some good suggestions -- you really do have to let her work it out on her own. As hard as it is, and as annoying as it can be, let her scream and learn to play by herself. Give her toys, walk away (make sure she's in a safe room, or a playpen!). If it gets too bad, get an ipod and listen to loud music, or wear earplugs even. Some kids take A LONG time to get out of that phase, unfortunately. (Mine is still in the phase at 3.5 years. Haha). <br>  If daycare isn't an option, look into mommy + me play groups -- it'll help her and you interact with others your ages, and it will help her and you learn to 'communicate' better to hopefully avoid some of the frustrations. <br>  Some people have their heads so far up their butt they don't realize that kids aren't always a walk in the park. ;) Kids can be terribly difficult, and in the moment it seems SO impossible to get past it. I can assure you, it does get easier. Soon she'll be walking and talking up a storm, and she'll be able to just say, "Hey, mom! I'm hungry - feed me!" or whatever it is that's upsetting her at the time. <br>  You WILL get past this, and so will she. Everything is going to be okay -- you just have to (as dumb as it sounds) keep reminding yourself that soon enough, she'll be past it. I promise, you'll be able to look back and laugh and say, "Wow...I thought that was bad? ha!" (I've done it MANY times already! lol). <br>  If it is too much, find family or friends that can take the baby, even for just a few hours so you can have some 'you' time. Don't let yourself get lost in being a 'mommy'...take care of your personal needs too, whenever you can. That's the trick to being a happy, low-stress stay at home mom. (Easier said than done, I know. :/).<br>  If you ever want to talk or vent or anything, send me a message. :) I'm always around, and I've always got time to compare war stories about kids. haha!|`|7lPspOboaa	I completely understand where you are coming from.  Is there someone who can come over and give you a hand by playing with the baby?  If you don't live near a relative, see if there is a teen or preteen you could have come over for an afternoon to take care of the baby so you can take a few hours to clean and unwind.  Can you afford to take her to a mom's morning out program?  That would be another option for you.<br>  <br>  Arrange with your husband to take charge of the baby for a bit so you can take a shower/bubble bath alone.  I know a cluttered house is hard to relax in but you do need to take some time for yourself  <br>  <br>  This is a phase that will pass.  It will be okay.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	If there is nothing wrong with her, set her in her playpen, and if she cries, let her. She'll calm  down.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	It can get very stressful if baby is clingy and demanding and there is alot of crying.   You are not a bad mom,  you are a tired,  stressed mom dealing with a young child and things are probably getting on top of you.   It is very understandable.<br>  <br>  I think priorities here are important.    You and child first.   Home second.    I know the home can look like a bomb has hit it sometimes,  but you know  it's ok to let some things slide sometimes.  The main thing is your relationship with your daughter and also making sure you are being taking care of.   <br>  <br>  Who is taking care of you?    You need to look after yourself.  Get plenty of rest.   If your little one only naps for half an hour.  Then you know what.   You should nap too.  Chill out and rest. or take a bubble bath in that time.    <br>  Do you have anyone who can give you help? <br>  Just knowing that you have a break coming up soon can keep you remaining positive.<br>  <br>  Where is your husband in this picture?   Does he give you time to yourself?     <br>  <br>  Also make sure your baby is not hurting in anyway,  has a pain or discomfort anywhere and that is why she is crying.  So please make sure she receives check ups and adequate  health care.  You can mention about  the persistent crying.<br>  <br>  Your baby needs to feel secure,   wanted and loved.    Make things fun for her and she needs stimulation,  make sure she has things to play with,   pretty fun things to look at.    A baby recognises when mom is angry,  sad,  pissed off,  happy.   They have feelings and are very aware of the atmosphere.     So smile at baby,  and interact with her when you are cleaning something or when you are preparing food.    <br>  <br>  And if she is crying,   just carry on doing what you are doing.   She doesn't want to be dumped out of the way,   she wants to be near you which is understandable but you don't have to pick her up every 5 mins.     In time she will feel more secure and become more independant.   It will happen,  so give her time.   <br>  You can do short separations.   If she is in her play pen.  You can leave her for 5 minutes.   Yep just five minutes and then go back to her.   This will allow her to know that you are not disappearing for a long time and will be back.<br>  In that five minutes.   Step outside,  take in some deep breaths or go into another room.  Play music so you can't hear the crying.     If little girl is in a safe place,  nothing is going to happen,   don't worry.<br>  <br>  These are just a few suggestions.    Being a mom is demanding at times.    I know.   And all sorts of emotions can get us.   That is normal too.    So give yourself a break,  don't be hard on yourself.<br>  <br>  Just know time flies by,  and those child hood days can never be recaptured and so once they are gone,  they are gone.<br>  So weigh up what is important.  <br>  As little one gets older,   you can include her in the activities,   she can have a little cloth and pretend she is cleaning,  just like mommy.|`|LERHErpmaa	this is definatly a problem that can be fixed. since she was little, you probably catered to her hand and foot. now, she knows that all she has to do is cry and you will pick her up and hold her. <br>  she needs to learn how to play in a playpan by herself. if it takes her crying herself into a fit, thats fine. just let her learn that mommy is not always going to solve the problem, she needs to figure it out. <br>  as weird as it sounds, this is classical conditioning. she learned that you would be there all the time and that mommy will fix everything, but this is just going to lead to her being extremely dependent, which is already causing problems. <br>  you MUST put naptime back into her schedule. it is important for her growth and development, and is very important for you to get some time for yourself. take her on a car ride or for a stroller walk when you want her to sleep. eventually she will need to sleep at that time everyday. <br>  maybe buy her a walker or a jumper that goes between the doorway. she is at the age where she can stand up with support, so help her become mobile so your hands are free, but she is not stuck in a crib or playpen. she will probably love the freedom and mobility once she has it.<br>  you are not a bad mother at all. you are concerned about her and your well being, and that is more that a lot of mothers do. <br>  good luck|`|NBNaQ8xpaa	I've seen this before, and I've warned my wife about this (as I have a daughter due to be born in 2 months).  She knows nothing more than to be at your side. You're NOT a bad mom.<br>  <br>  The best way to fix this is to put her in her playpen (or crib for a nap, whatever) and let her cry for a little while. She's crying for attention, which you're giving her. You keep supplying, and she'll keep demanding.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, call on a friend or a family member to come give you a hand some days. Have them take her off your hands while you get some stuff done.  Who's gonna turn down playing with a 10 month old girl?|`|a1uoxczTaa	i currently watch a 9 month old girl. she sleeps at the most 4 hours a day while i am here from 7:30am to 4:30pm. i do have to hold her a bit but she does do good on the floor and with toys. does your daughter play with toys like that? they have various toys for her to play with on the floor plus like a dollhouse and such. she does good for a little bit in the high chair while we do things around the kitchen. they give her like small pieces of a banana or cheerios or animal cookies. while we aren't holding her though, we always talk back to her or make sounds and stuff. just think of different ways to keep her occupied.|`|jBhY3Phpaa	These is perfectly normal reaction for someone who stays at home with their child. I went through the same exact emotions, and still do sometimes, and my daughter is 2 and a half!! I began to resent my husband for being able to go to work. I would try to stretch her naps out as long as possible, cry like a mad woman, wish I'd never had her. I talked to my mom about it, and she said everyone gets stressed out with new changes, no sleep, no 'me time'. Then I tried to change things for the better. Sometimes when she would cry and cry, i would put her in her crib, so she couldn't get hurt, close the door, and step outside for a few minutes. Just to catch my breath. We got her a swing, which she fell in love with. I could put her in there and do laundry, load the dish washer, etc. It's very hard being there 24-7. There are also Mommy's day out programs at local churches. They will keep your child for a few hours once a week, or once a month, depending on the program. It will give you time to do what you need to get done. Even if it is take a nap! As long as it's helpful! Only you can figure out what is best for you, and what works for your daughter! It will get better, I promise. And one day, before you know it,  you'll be wishing she wanted your undivided attention!!|`|mVD3TQkFaa	My baby is 4 weeks old and of course I spend every single waking hour with her and she has already become very attached to me as well. She screams when I'm not holding her and she doesn't nap much during the day either. I find myself feeling the same way already:-( Your not a bad mom your just getting frustrated. Do you have anyone to help you? Can you maybe take up a part time job or something to get you out of the house and start getting a little separation from your baby? Even taking up a hobby or joining a gym or exercises class a few times a week would help and have daddy or maybe grandma or grandpa watch the baby while you get some me time. Being a SAHM is a huge load and you deserve some me time every mother does. Good luck hun I hope you get your much needed break;-)
CSzDV3gEaa	sounds like you've got a full house! it would be hard for most people but if your family is financially stable and you all help out it is probably a good thing. you should watch 18 kids and counting on TLC!|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Whoa. 17?

uFrqC4Y2aa	I wouldn't worry if I were you. Having sex for the first time sometimes changes your period cycle. You're being smart and using protection. If you are currently sexually active you may want to go back on the pill just to be on the safe side.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	I seriously doubt you are pregnant.  Your periods might be off schedule for a few months if you stopped using the pill.  If you are nervous you might be pregnant then take a test about a week after your period was due.|`|8RfmosODaa	Don't freak out it sounds like you took precautions so i think everything is fine. But you should probably stay on bc so you know there is no chance of becoming pregnant. You can take a test the first day of a missed period but it is more accute if you wait til a few days after.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	if you missed your period you can test today.  first morning is best for better concentration of the hormone detected.  sometimes you never have symptoms for until a couple of wks into the pregnancy.  you can buy tests at dollar generals or dollar tree for $1 & they are accurate.  i used them for last couple of pregnancies.<br>  pull out method is no way to not get pregnant if you want to wait.  i got pregnant at 16 by that method.  but since you used protection you are probably pretty safe.  if you freak out too much your body can get out of wack.  just relax, good luck in whatever happens.|`|AA10071149	If you are truly nervous and you are supposed to start your period today or tomorrow, I would think you could test anytime. Go out and by a test. Get one with two in it so you can do it twice to help set your mind at ease.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	There would be no pregnancy "symptoms" this early.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Looks like you did everything right not to get pregnant. So it's highly unlikely that you are. My question is if pregnancy really isnt what you want why did you stop taking the pill. Your period might be off for a month or so after stopping the pill. It doesnt mean that you are pregnant. If you are still nervous take a test 5 days after your missed period!|`|JOA8vW1eaa	my sis took birth control for a while and she stopped  taking hers as well for some reason. her period cycle has always been regular until after she stopped taking the pill. don't worry too much about not having your period yet. you could just be a couple of days off which is fine!! but if by next week you are still having troubles and are still concerned then i would definitely say to go and take a test!! good luck with everything and stay positive!!|`|mOQOaNOIaa	i would not worry too much because you used some kind of protection but if you are too worried go and get a test just to be safe and put your mind at ease there is a test that is out there that is 5 days after having sex but i don't know i knew i was pregnant with both of my pregnancies so good luck to you|`|AA11518532	I would suggest about 3 to 5 days after you have missed your period, then you will know for sure, but if you used protection your chances of being pregnant are really small and if you’re not showing any signs and don’t feel sick, you’re probably not pregnant.  Good luck!|`|AA11661793	if you are nervous about getting pregnany why did you stop your pills? But if the protection or anything didnt break you should be ok. If your period doesnt come by Friday take a test. Good luck.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Since you stopped your birth control your period might be slightly "messed up" for about a month or two don't worry!|`|BNcExYEeaa	you're supposed to take a test two weeks after you have had sex so.. u should probably take one this week or the next but if i were you I'd use first response that's the best one|`|joPJtKemaa	You should test 5 days after you miss your period.

But I would think that if you do save it the hormones will still be there and it will still show up.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	I took a pregnancy test on Sunday night and it was negative. I took one this morning and it was positive. I suggest you just pee on a stick first thing in the morning.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	If you must use morning urine put it in your fridge and take it out an hour or so before. If I was you though, I'd just pee at 6. x

lsCiBE4Oaa	I'm sorry, but apparently, I'm going to be the bad guy.  First off, it is way more important to stay at home with your kids no matter what!  I worked in a day care, those workers do not care for your kids like you do.  They are hardly getting any pay to take care of your kids.  Kids learn by example and you have no idea what they are teaching your kids.  <br>  I have several friends that are barely making ends meet, but they stay home with their kids.  I would never in a million years put my children in a day care. I thank God every day, that I do not have to work and put my kids in those places, and we are not making a lot of money.  <br>  <br>  My sister/brother-in-law have their twins in a day care.  They have been in day care less then 4 months and they have been SO sick.  They are sick all the time.  I really want to ask her, is it all worth it? All the doctor's appointments, not being able to stay home with your kids when they are sick b/c you do not have any sick leave??? <br>  Exchanging money and stuff for time well spent with your kids.  <br>  <br>  I would definitely take a second look at your financial situation and see if you can give up something before putting your kids in day care<br>  <br>  Sorry for being so mean, but it's the truth.|`|w7fCw6WTaa	You obviously knew what your financial situation was when you decided to have a third child. Sorry but I've got little sympathy for you. Would you lose your home or not be able to eat without this extra money?|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I thought about the things it would help my kids have in life and that alone made me want to go back.|`|AA11109728	As a single mom who works full time, I understand how you feel.  What matters is that you are working because your family needs it - the children will benefit in the long run because of it.  Making sure your kids are happy with who is taking care of them while you are working, and making the most of the time you DO have with them make a big difference.  There are plenty of times I don't want to go to work all day, every day of the workweek, but if I didn't then my daughter and I wouldn't have all the things we do.  Because I work we have a decent apt., food, clothing, a car, health insurance, and extras.  Plus just the fact that my daughter has grown up being around other people, both kids and adults at the sitter's, and the fact that she's gotten to take part in things that she wouldn't otherwise, makes it beneficial for her.  I'm glad she gets that type of social interaction, because I am very much not like that so it's good that she will be different in that way.  <br>  <br>  All you can do is focus on the positives.  Stop telling yourself you failed your kids and stop feeling ashamed.  Just the fact that you know you have to work in order to better support your family is being very responsible and caring and a great mom on your part!  Take pride in the fact that you are giving your kids what they need, and make the most of it!<br>  <br>  ETA - OK!  Now you're annoying me.  You came here looking for advice, and we are trying our best.  I understand you are frustrated, but YOU are the one who insists you need to bring in more money.  Instead of looking at the bright side, you insist on being negative even with all the advice you got.  It doesn't seem you are being very open-minded at all.  And as for a 3 yr. old not knowing how the electricity comes on, it's not that difficult.  When my daughter has a 'I want to stay home' morning, I try to let her know that mommy has to go to work, otherwise we would have no home to live in, and no extra things like toys.  I try to express to her that not all kids are lucky enough to have even a home, or that some kids have parents who don't care about them, and that some kids don't have things to play with or dinner to eat.  She is fully capable of understanding that, and it gets her thinking and realizing how lucky we are even if it doesn't seem that way at the moment.|`|KmC0K59taa	I went back to work full time when my baby was 8 weeks old.  She went to a daycare.  She is now 22 months old and still at the same daycare.<br>  <br>  It is very hard at first.  It was just not possible for me to not work.  We have loans and a mortgage to pay off.  We could have done it, but we would have had no money leftover for anything.  <br>  <br>  I make sure I spend all my free time with my daughter.  My husband does too.  She is our only child and she gets lots of social interaction at daycare that she would not get at home.  She is learning there as well.  I know that she is being well taken care of and that helps me feel better.  I also know that I am working so she can have money for a college education.|`|b73c0650e88fbb9212d144ed8074dbbeaa	I COMPLETELY understand the way you feel, and for NO REASON should you feel guilty or embarassed!!!! You are doing what is best for your children in the long run. I have been a SAHm to my toddler for her whole life now (she is 2) and am about to start workng and going to school. I kow it is what is best for her, and your children can benifit from daycare! Being around other chidlren, learning through play, an just being away is healthy for them. And you may find work RELAXING as I think  may ;) And abut not spending much time w/ them, that is my problem! I am debating on keeping her up until like 1:0 just to play with me because I will want to spend so much time with her! It will all work out for the best, and don't let anyone tell you any different! I can see you are an AMAZING Mommy!|`|f5d91f8e333da0f50f6a54def14221f9aa	I put my 6 month old daughter in day care after her evening-shift-working dad (who was supposed to watch her in the day) let her fall out of the bed and didn't even wake up to hear her crying.  She went to a very good daycare in a center, not a family home, because you don't know who comes in and out of a family home.  In a center, there is much more security.  She did so well, I never regretted it.  She started reading at 3, could count and add by 4.  Just make sure it is a quality center with STRUCTURE, not just a babysitting service.|`|fe4a7c5e36d28eb34ebcf6d49980a6faaa	Well how much will it be for 3 kids to be put into day care? Then what is the actually amount you will be bringing home ... can you make this amount another way? There are tons of things you can do on the side. Waitressing is a big one to do a few hours at night if you pick the right place. Or ebay. There are MANY things you can sell. Take the kids antiquing and sell what you find on ebay. Go to thrift stores, yard sales, etc. I am trying to leave my full time job at the moment and these things have worked for me. I also do graphic design on the side and sell concert tickets.|`|TQW5E6olaa	1. I'm single and not a big fan of welfare if you can work.<br>  <br>  2.

You ask how do other mothers deal with this - well, they make do. And many of them feel just as guilty as you're about to feel. But they have to work, just as you are now being forced to work. You'll survive this.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Guilt is a useless emotion, What is embarrassing about having a career? Set by example.|`|8RfmosODaa	I'm sorry about your situation. I know how you feel. I have a 3 year old son whom I have gotten the chance to be home with since I had him. But lately my dh and I have been talking and we too need more money. I really dont like the idea of having to pay some else to do what I wanna do, so I know how you are feeling. I prefer to be home with him. I on the other hand of you have no experince but with waitressing so I would have no clue where to even start to look for a job. I have thought of going back to school but am still unsure. I know it will be hard at first but just think of it this way, you are trying to give your children a good life and have some extra income. Our economy is really in a bad place right now so alot of mama's have to do what you have to do and we dont wanna do it. Good Luck!|`|oP504BtFaa	Well first, explore as many options as you can find. Could you work at home? Could you work three or four days a week? Could you get a job at your children's school as a helper or assistant librarian? There are so many options of work out there that can bring you money and give you flexibility. <br>  <br>  While I respect your opinion on this, I completely disagree. You are not a failure by any means, and you will be with your kids as much as you can. While you won't be there every waking moment with them, you will get to pick them up from school and hear about their day and the excitement they have when they DO spend time with you will be priceless. While SAHM also provide their children with someone to look up to, so do working moms! They will see that you are responsible and hardworking and it's all for them - and later in life they will be very grateful for all that you've done. You cannot be super mom and working is NOT the worst thing you can do. Explore your options and think positively - when you are working, take the time you DO have with your children and bask in it.<br>  <br>  Plus, there are tons of way to make time in the evenings for your children - try to cook three or four meals on Saturday and have them ready to make during the week (look on foodnetwork.com for 'Quick Fix' recipes by Robin Miller. She makes three meals for the week in one go, it's great)|`|wZAeBisbaa	Well first, you are not a failure.  You DO deserve to have children, and you ARE caring for them.  If you have no choice but to work to support your family, there is no reason to feel guilty.  Wouldn't it be worse to live with financial stress or debt just because you want to spend time with them?  That would be meeting your own needs, but not necessarily theirs. <br>  <br>  Someone else is not raising them - you are, with the help of caring and qualified child care providers. This will not "do anything to them."  It may be hard for you, but they won't think there is anything wrong with it if you don't share your conflicted feelings.  Present it as a positive change, and they will see it as such.  Lots of kids go to daycare and are just fine.  They grow up and remember it as normal.  They will be your children forever, not just when they are little. The day care years are only a short part of that.  <br>  <br>  You are a professional with advanced education. Someday you will want your own life back, too.  It may seem far off now, but it will happen sooner than you think.  Keeping your skills and experience updated will benefit you and your kids when they're ready to start college and you're ready to live for yourself again. <br>  <br>  Everyone does what they have to.  Don't feel bad about it.  Maybe it could be temporary. You might be able to quit or cut back again after a while.  The economy can't stay this bad forever (I hope).
a1uoxczTaa	no that is about the right amount of time to be able to know if you are pregnant. an expected period is usually around 2 weeks away after conception.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	nope, thats about right. its only about 1 day early to find out. if you ovulated on the 10th, had sex on the 10th, you could very well find out on the 23rd. <br>  <br>  i got pregnant too as soon as we started trying. so, it happens. some people just don't get to put in as much 'practice time' as other couples.<br>  <br>  its all good.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	no that is perfectly possible, some tests are stronger than others and different peoples hormones go up quicker than others.  2 weeks is a pretty average amount of time to be able to test. congrats!|`|AA11022786	You were actually pregnant when you started having sex...and the home urine tests can only detect HCG after it builds up for about 14 days. I don't know why you would think it's too soon to be pregnant since it only takes once.|`|058cbe8f080311800ecccf5877b18677aa	False positives are very rare, it is much more common to have a false negative.  I was only 1 day late on my period when i found out i was pregnant.
0qP8gLpyaa	I think what you're doing is fair. Sounds to me like her friends aren't the best influence on her if they are getting her into trouble doing stuff like this. True enough, she has her own brain and is her own person and she didn't have to go along with it, but she did.  Hopefully the "friends" all got suspended as well.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't back down at all on what you did. Removing all forms of communication from her, restricting her at home and removing her privilege to go to a school dance is appropriate. If she can't get herself to class and do what is expected of her then she doesn't need the privilege of a dance. There has to be consequences in life and this is one of those times.  It may make her think twice before skipping out on class again.  Someone at McDonalds probably called the school to rat them out. If they did, then good for the employee or person who made the call.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	when we were in school we never got punished for skipping school, but we would get it for getting bad grades. I think it taught us that we had to live with our choices and plan ahead. If I skip school today, whether I get caught or not, I miss a test and my mark will drop vs If I skip school today and get caught I get in trouble. It made us think long term about the consequences whether we got caught or not.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I wouldn't let my lids go to the dance or anything else for that matter. Oh I do believe I have grounded my son from a dance once.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I haven't because it hasn't come up, but I think you should.<br>  Skipping is a WAY serious offense!! You're doing the right thing, mom!|`|124377045ceac9826f76a176d439bd8faa	Unless you can think of a punishment that would be at least as meaningful to her as missing the dance, then unfortunately, that is the only option.<br>  <br>   I am mindful of those who have pointed out that this is a one time special event. However, this is something serious and can not just be swept under the rug (i.e. grounding her, but letting her go to the dance).<br>  <br>  I would seriously consider the option of a paddling, and let her go to the dance, but I am sure that most people would think that inappropriate.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	I don't have kids so I won't pretend to be an expert, but in my non-expert opinion, I'd take take away something that wasn't a once-in-a-childhood event.  Maybe suspend TV/computer/phone privileges or ground her.  She'll only have one shot at this dance and let's face it, who of us hasn't skipped school?<br>  Again, I don't have kids, so my opinion might be different if I had gone through the trials of raising them.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I'd call you a great parent.<br>  <br>  I think the older teens today have been protected to an absurd degree---so the first time they really mess up, its also the first time they face harsh consequences. <br>  <br>  Your daughter will be angry...but she will also learn the lesson about breaking the rules. School is too important to play games with!<br>  <br>  <br>  My seventeen year old, just added this..."She wants to go to a school function with her friends...but since she skipped school, she should therefore be punished by making her skip a "school function". And living Amish for a while!|`|cA3DDRGraa	I would definitely not let her go. It is just a school dance for the love of ice cream, big deal. You have to show who is in control. If you let her go then she is in control of you. If she thinks she is big enough to skip school then she is big enough to suffer the consequences.<br>  <br>  gram|`|2xS1Jro7aa	yes you should make her miss the dance! It will teach her that you are not going to put up with that! Plus its not the prom or something. There will be many more dances but she will never forget being punished and will think twice before trying to pull something like that again! Good luck!|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	not only have I done it to my son I had it done to me when I was a kid. Stand your ground. Going to school functions is not a RIGHT it is a privilege..|`|8quTABk6aa	I think there should be harsh parental punishment for skipping school.  She will be better off for it in the future.<br>  <br>  She now knows that such behavior will result in significant consequences.|`|AA11349925	I feel bad for her not going but honestly it's for the best. It may seem harsh to her but it will make her think twice before skipping school again. And there will be other dances.|`|Gk4kNAWsaa	you're doing great.<br>  <br>  this is an excellent punishment. responsibility runs both ways and they have to learn that. hit them where it hurts. i know that sounds harsh, but my parents would have done the same thing and i turned out just fine--better than most because they were so strict. i have a 3 year old and i'm learning, too. if ruby did that, there would be no way i would let her go to a dance after that. also, thank goodness the school is taking measures. i grew up in a very small, rural area and if you got caught, not only did you get suspended for 2 days, but they made you go out and do community service like picking up trash on the side of the road. no kidding.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|RLoilwCNaa	Kids will be kids but that sounds like a fair punishment if she really wanted to go.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Yes and all other things except it they play sports on a team, then its there and back home .<br>  She needs to be taught a good lesson and it has to start right now.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|H41u0B8Jaa	I think you should punish her by not allowing her to go to the dance.  I believe she will think twice next time she feels like skipping school.
xwZKouCIaa	I am going through something very similar to you.. the first thing i would like to advise you to do is go and talk to a doctor, visit your local planned parenthood and tell them that you would like to start trying to conveive and she might prescirbe you a drug that will cause you to ovulate, (just because you have psoc does not mean you will never have a child trust me) all you need is a lil boost wit the medications will ovulate ask your doctor when your most fertile days will be she will help track them for you have sex on those days and you shouldn't have  problem getting pregnant. (as long as there is nothing else wrong wit you or him) which is another reason you should go see the doctor first anyway, you want to make sure you are your healthiest before you concieve so that you give the baby the best possible odds.. good luck i hope this information helps...
tcHkn0VIaa	Are your cycles usually so long. 10 days is a long time for a period to last. on a usual 28 day cycle you ovulate midway through your cycle which is around 13-15 days after the first day of your last period but that can vary. If you are trying to conceive there is a possibility and you can take a test when you expect your next period to begin. If it is negative i would schedule an appointment with you gynecologist to find out if you are normal or what about your cycle can effect your ovulation. The more you know about how your body works the better chances you and your hubby have of putting a bun in that oven!!!
FXINmF6saa	Any time you start on birth control you need to wait 2 weeks to start having unprotected se. The first 2 weeks you have to use a condom. But I would still recommend you use another source of protection against infections and STD's. Remember birth control doesn't protect you against those. Good Luck.|`|v0596BTeaa	Read the instruction leaflet form the pack, or ask the doctor who prescribed birth control pills for you.  Remember that the pill does not offer any protection against sexually transmitted diseases or cervical cancer.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	At least a month, three is reccomended for any birthh control. I'm sure it came with an information packet, read it.|`|F4rD4HF0aa	it's usually 2  1/2 weeks  i might know just cause i have a wife lol|`|yzzogHLQaa	Think it's recommended to take a full pack before having unprotected sex. Read the booklet that comes with your b/c just to be sure.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would give it about 1 month.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	idk|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Personally I'd wait a month to be safe (I was overly cautious) but with YAZ you only had to wait a week.  You can call your local pharmacist and they'll tell you over the phone easily.  :-)
qH1YcQ2kaa	if the cut is really deep, take her to the er.<br>  if its just a little cut, hold it under cold water for a minute then put some neosporin on it and rap it with a band aid<br>  <br>  *also check and make sure there are no little pieces of glass in the cut|`|kuHE3z2Maa	First off, she may need stitches. If it's just a small cut, wash her finger well, put some anti-biotic ointment on the cut, and firmly (but not overly firmly) put a band-aid on it. The band-aid will stop the bleeding.|`|q3DZB4u3aa	Just make sure to apply pressure with a cold rag...it will stop...don't be alarmed|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	TAKE HER TO THE ER!!!  DUH!!!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	If its a deep cut or a large cut wrap a hand towel around it and take her to the er. <br>  <br>  If it is just a small slice then run it under cold water or hold some ice cubes rapped in a cloth on it or something cold for awhile.  Perhaps have her take it easy, as activity can increase blood pressure and make bleeding continue.  I wouldn't use a band aide as this poses a choking risk.  Wrap a wash cloth around it until bleeding subsides.|`|rAkWoweOaa	If it is not a lot of blood, just apply pressure until it stops, then you can get liquid bandage.

xPR7g0wFaa	Whew. If I told you everything I knew and witnessed at these beauty pageants I would be here all night. I'm guilty of having my kids in these pageants.I was involved in them starting in 1988 when my first child was 2. I went on to have my other two children do them also. My first two were boys,doing them was not a big deal.When my daughter was born I started doing them with her.She done very well as "a baby"held state titles, but when she got to be 3 things started to get weird. I had really never noticed the fakeness, the money, the makeup artist that were hired, spray on tans,fake nails,fake teeth and fake hair(3&4 year olds).<br>  Dont get me wrong,Im not an angry mom, my daughter always placed and sometimes won against these little girls(not very often) because I refused to fake her up like that. As far as the picture you have posted, its photo touched.They pay high dollars for pictures to be touched up.I remember one little girl that had her 8x10 win the most photogenic, her mom was so excited because that one<br>   picture cost her over $400.00. It took me a very long time to realize I didnt need to pay someone to tell me how cute my kid was.What it comes down to is this, If your going to do these pageants you better have the major bucks to back up the "extras" you need for your child to win.I wasted alot of money and time that could have been spent on other things for my kids. The tropies and crowns lay in boxes in the basement. They do have savings bonds, but I could have bought them myself and actually saved thousands.I wish I knew then what I know now. Oh, One day I will share how the moms act when they(I mean) their kids dont win, thats another story. Hope this helps.|`|64OsCr8laa	when it comes to glamor shots like thst yes im against it but if its something like modeling for jcpenny's or maybe like a child photographer looking to take pics for his company then i would not have a problem with that my niece was doing a jcpenny's shoot and it was perfect she had no make up on and she looked great so something like that i see no harm in|`|zFT0FFogaa	I think parents that put their children through all that are being abusive.|`|yo9XNz61aa	Well chances are that the picture you are seeing was photo shopped by the photographer so yes her skin and face look like a doll!  Ive seen worse!  I think pageants are great and they are a great way to get some little ones out of their shell!  I will say that some parents are a little obsessive but I dont see any thing wrong with them as long as the child enjoys it and its for the child not the parent.  As for me?  My daughter will do pageants until she says she doesnt like them or want to do them anymore and we will stop! (right now shes just a baby)  I also wont be the parent who puts a ton of makeup on her child either.  But its fun for a lot of little girls b/c its kinda like dress up!  They get to get their hair done and put on a little makeup and a pretty dress!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i think it depends if it's something small and silly and my daughter says mom i want to try that ... then i would be willing to take her to one HOWEVER spending the amounts of money on special made clothes,make up, hair dressers and such is just crazy to me. half these kids don't even want to do it or aren't old enough to understand what's going on. i think it's a parents way of living through their child and trying to prove something. especially now that these kinds of shows are on TV i think it's opening a whole new door into child predators... it's sick really i don't know how they allow it. painting a kid up like a doll is NOT a way to go through childhood. again if the child wants to participate that's one thing but you have to be careful of crossing the line into crazy. all in all if i had a choice i would say ban them. what does it do for a child's self esteem? especially one that doesn't understand that it's effort that counts NOT what you win.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	I think it's dumb and messed up.<br>  then we wonder why some girls r so full of themselves!!
wyAtVqbOaa	Breast feed.  Sorry I'm all for breastfeeding and take it from somebody who has been there and done that - twice - you will learn how to do it, feel confident about breastfeeding in public and nobody will be any the wiser.  You can express but you may find that you are not able to express - I did until both of mine hit 6 weeks and then I couldn't.<br>  <br>  When I first went out I couldn't get my first to latch on and admitted that I was so conscious of flashing my breast.  My husband got up, walked around the table to the pushchair, looked for something then came and sat down.  He then said in an upset voice, "sorry hun but I tried as hard as I could but I couldn't see any boobs.  Maybe next time!"  I relaxed and feed straight away.  <br>  <br>  One time I was feeding our youngest and Hubby's uncle came admire and to stroke her, saying that she was cute sleeping - until she looked round at him and gave a big smile - I have never seen Uncle R be so embarrassed and if he can miss me breastfeeding (he likes looking at the breast area) then so can everybody else!<br>  <br>  As for the busy house, go to your bedroom and feed there.  If you feel conscious about going, don't.  People won't notice you missing and when they do, your feeding.  <br>  <br>  OK, when your feeding, regardless where you are, your t-shirt, which you will always wear for ease, will cover your breast up to their nose and the baby's tummy etc will be covering your belly.  If you want, sling a loose blanket or shawl over your shoulder of the breast you are feeding and wrap baby with it.  This will cover any tummy that baby doesn't hide as well as your lap.  <br>  <br>  Practise will work and if you can do it now, do so.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and if you need any further help, email me and I can help and if necessary, forward you some pictures.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Educate yourself some more on the benefits of breastfeeding. Their are benefits not only for the baby but yourself as well. For my first child I didn't want to breastfeed in front of people either so I went in my bedroom. It was great. I got to relax and spend quiet time bonding with my baby every couple of hours. <br>  Expressing breastmilk gives the some of the same benefits but not all. Pumping is much harder to do then breastfeeding.|`|MPCfQuT5aa	I breastfed all three of my children. I never had the need to feed them in public (always fed them before shopping etc) and when visiting family and friends did not have any problems.<br>  Expressing milk is relatively easy, but sometimes babies do not take to being feed by both breast and bottle. It is very easy to be discreet when needed and you shouldn't let other peoples comments put you off.|`|FYiKgeN8aa	Expressing is very good, but not as good as breastfeeding your baby.  It is very difficult to keep up with baby's demand just by strictly expressing.<br>  <br>  If you are not comfortable nursing in public there are lots of covers that you can buy or even a blanket helps.  It just looks like baby is sleeping.|`|ERxJmMYQaa	i have a 7 month old, and breast fed till he was 6 months.<br>  i loved breast feeding, and bought nursing tops which made it very easy in public. no one noticed, with the help of a muslin over his head.<br>  expressing takes a while to do, so u would have to express maybe for 20 minutes in time for when the baby is hungry ( which in my case was every hour at some points), then have to bottle feed for 20 minutes, and then wash breast pump and bottles etc etc, so over all its quicker and less hassle just to breast feed, as time is very valuable with a new born, ....<br>  good luck|`|Eznkhnmeaa	Breastfeeding takes dedication but is so so easy when you have the know how!!! I would do it again.<br>  <br>  I don't feed in public, I go to changing units etc when I go out. Mothercare, John Lewis and most good dept stores have nice changing units you can lock!!!<br>  <br>  When you are in someone's house, ask to use a room.....failing that, I use the toilet!!!<br>  <br>  I don't have much support in b/f......everyone around me thinks I am nuts and always telling me to 'get her on a bottle'. The more they say this, the longer I will b/f.....he he! The more my girl will benefit!<br>  <br>  Expressing isn't difficult if you get a good pump......you get used to it I think (I have only done it a couple of times because I have no need to)<br>  <br>  Millions do it..........................give it a try, if you don't like doing it or can't, put your wee one on formula.......there is absolutely nothing wrong with that whatsoever and millions do formula as well!!!<br>  <br>  It works for some and not for others. I was one of the lucky ones!!!<br>  <br>  Do what is best for you and your baby, forget about what others think or say...................good luck and all the best.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	If privacy is the issue, you should voice your feelings and try to get one of those breastfeeding blankets. Expressing is just as good as breastfeeding but if you only express, you run the risk of cutting your milk supply too soon. My Doctor says you should only pump 2 or 3 times a day, and that's after baby has breastfed. Best of luck!|`|j7fzuDxgaa	yes i agree its very easy to cover up. i was at my cousins house breast feeding once he had all his friends there they did not even know i was feeding my baby, you will become more confident i did not take bottles out, i fed him at bus stops in cafes etc he was really screaming once so my friend pushed his buggy and i fed him whilst walking up the hill lol. best of luck|`|vue9NOhYaa	We live in society where we rarely see nursing mothers, so breastfeeding can seem a bit strange and scary if you have never done it.<br>  <br>  Once you DO do it, you'll almost certainly find that it feels very natural and normal, and you won't worry about breastfeeding in front of other people.  It's not necessary to strip to the waist to nurse a baby -- you can do so very discreetly (either with special nursing covers or wearing normal clothes) and people around you will see nothing.  <br>  <br>  Pumping and bottlefeeding is possible, but it's MUCH more difficult and time consuming than just nursing. (It takes roughly twice as long, since you have to pump, and then give the bottle.) Also, many women find that their supply drops after a few weeks/months, and they have to supplement or wean to formula. (The pump just isn't as effective as the baby in stimluating your supply.)   Finally, while breastmilk in a bottle is far better than formula in a botttle, it's NOT quite the same.  There are benefits to breastfeeding directly that are not present when baby is fed by bottle.<br>  <br>  I would strongly urge you to give breastfeeding a try.  Start out just nursing, and give yourself about 4-6 weeks. By the end of that time, you should be past the early difficulties, and find nursing very easy..  If, at that point, you aren't enjoying it, you can start pumping and give milk by bottle.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I wasn't really a fan of breast feeding in public either.  I had forceful letdown so the milk would come out very fast and my son couldnt swallow it all so it would run down my stomach the whole time.  I found that if I held a blanket underneath to catch it it helped.  So when I needed to feed him in public like say if i was shopping I would feed him in the car between stores.  As for at home or friends houses you can feed him in your room or ask your friend if you can do so privately in their room.
FYiKgeN8aa	It think your baby is more important than if your boyfriend loves you or not.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	So just to clarify - you about 5 weeks pregnant.. The baby is NOT yet born and NOT 5 weeks old - right? I just looked at your other questions which is how i figured that out.<br>  <br>  You have 3 options.<br>  Aborting the pregnancy.<br>  Setting up an adoption.<br>  Being a mother.<br>  <br>  All three of those have their pluses and minuses.<br>  You will be confused and uncertain, sad and anxious no matter which one you choose (sorry that's life!).<br>  <br>  What you gotta figure out is what you would be more of.<br>  Like in each situation would I be 10% sad and 90% happy or what?<br>  <br>  Okay abortion.<br>  It's easy and fast - but that is really the only good thing about it.<br>  You would be killing the little life that is happening. A baby, a toddler a little person who you could teach things to and do things for, who would learn to talk and walk and laugh and be silly - would be dead. And that's it - it would be permanent. And you would be stuck with that decision and believe it or not you would miss that little person who you could have created and raised. <br>  I would say that option is about 3% good, 57% bad and 40% really really bad.<br>  <br>  So how about adoption.<br>  Well if you're not ready to raise the child and want to do other things than be a mommy, then adoption would let you do that. And that little person would still learn to walk and read and get to go places and meet people. But you wouldn't get to see them or be the one that raised the little person. Once again guilt and missing him/her would be tough. The 9 months would be tough - but 9 months is like a school year. It's the same length as 10th grade was, it's quick really. So adoption is more like 30% good, 50% bad, but only 20% really really bad.<br>  <br>  Being a mom.<br>  Okay this is like an entire life commitment.<br>  This is a huge deal. It will change your life and will take up a lot of your time - but a lot of that time will be good times. As for the hard times, I swear with or without the baby - you are going to have hard times in life. Regardless. If the father is a good man then you two will be a team raising this little person. Sharing love with that boy or girl. Whether you and his relationship works out isn't even relevant. As long as you and the kid's relationship works and the kid and the dad's relationship works - everything else will be cool. Billions of people in history consider a child the greatest gift of their entire lives. Why do you think they almost all say - best thing that ever happened to them?  I mean it is really freaking hard.. But there's no guilt.. Actually you get the opposite emotion. It's an accomplishment. So for that it's like 75% good, 20% bad, and basically 5% really bad (well really hard i mean).<br>  <br>  So you can see which way i'm leaning for you.<br>  Be calm young one. Relax. Get yourself peaceful and meditate on this decision. 18 years old is not quite grown up - but as an experiment try and think what you would tell yourself to do when you are 28.. Ya know? Try to have a conversation with the older more experienced version of you. It is going to be okay!|`|acj9mB9Paa	I am not going to preach at you or condemn you in any way.

If you would like any more info, please feel free to e-mail me!!  Good luck with your choice.|`|CdodhnP5aa	It sounds like you don't want the baby and the only reason your thinking of keeping it would be to make your boyfriend happy...if that is the case I would suggest you give it up and let someone that really wants a baby to have it.<br>  A boyfriend can leave whenever he wants the baby will be yours forever and you will always be "mom". Don't keep the baby if you don't REALLY want him/her, this is a decision for life and should be treated as such.|`|2MKvrydWaa	then keep it b/c  U will be the one carrying it for those 9 months.he may have helped make it,but it is always the mothers decision.congrats on the new future addition to your life coming soon:-)and good luck!!!|`|qtpuOf7Oaa	put it up for adoption so it will have a better life.|`|M1KYxcvSaa	Your baby is 5 weeks old or you're 5 weeks pregnant?<br>  <br>  No matter what you do, it will change your relationship with your boyfriend.  Having a baby always changes things.  I hope he really is a decent guy who will be there for you and the child but you also have to think about what you'd do if things don't work out with your boyfriend.  I know you're scared now, but take some time to relax and think things through.  You don't have to figure it all out today.|`|SpoLuhJzaa	the emotions of your parents finding out will subside <br>  but dotn kill that baby its a gift to you and it already has a heartbeat think about that and your parents will love you no matter what and your boyfirend will support you no matter what you decide but the right thing to do is keep it, the baby is a blessing....<br>  <br>  please do the right thing|`|W8Ljtah3aa	Your baby is the most important here, no matter what your boyfriend says or thinks about it. You are his/her mom and that's all that matters and that's all that they need. If he doesn't want to be there for the child, there is always WIC and child support. Just think about your baby, and make decisions that'll be best for him/her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	if you want to keep the child keep it forget what others say IT YOUR BABY!
hKJIDdVqaa	yes, her vision can improve. Yes she can also get eye surgery to improve the particular conditions she has.  My son is amblyopic and far sighted and has came from 'blind as a bat' to 20/40 vision.  Make sure she gets check ups every 6 months, and consider some eye therapy.  Keep those glasses on.  Also try video games, they increase muscle movements in eyes there by strengthening the eyes help them to see and focus better.  God Bless.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	It really depends because each case is very different.<br>  It is nothing to be ashamed of and nice looking glasses will correct her vision.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|F6lZHRkVaa	It will probably not improve, eyesight usually doesn't get slightly better until people are in their 40s or so. And even then, if a person has been wearing glasses their entire life they will still have to wear them. Vision never improves to the point that you can give up your glasses.<br>  <br>  I think you can do Lasik when she's older. For now don't worry about it. I've been wearing glasses since I was 12 and I absolutely love them.|`|AA10478980	That's something you need to talk about with her eye doctor.  Every situation is different and it requires professional knowledge of your daughter's specific case to answer your questions with any certainty.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	You need to discuss this with her eye care specialist.  Perhaps when she is older she will be able to have LASIK surgery and have the problem corrected.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	yes vision can improve, be sure you are seeing a pediatric eye specialist|`|pcEJMHPMaa	It depends on her family history and ask her eye doctor.|`|64f9613dd1a4452e24f6f8f603fab217aa	astigmatism is for ever but she could have surgery for the farsightedness later in life but it will not get better|`|6Y58oOMVaa	Hopefully|`|AA12004844	it probably will not improve<br>  <br>  she can get lasik when she is an adult - i don't think they do it on kids yet<br>  <br>  sorry
FUNhlpiqaa	I went through that too.  A lot of things change after you have a baby.  Your body is still getting back to normal, you have baby on the brain, your rest is interrupted and your time is not your own!  Your husband will just have to be patient with you until you can get used to life with kids!  I promise, you will find a way to balance things and you can both enjoy sex again.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	When you first have a baby its hard to transition from mother to lover.  It's hard to think in a sexual or sensual way when you've spent all day feeding and cleaning a tiny baby.  I had this same problem after each of my children were born.  It will pass, believe me.  I know it's hard.  Try talking to your husband about how you're feeling.  try to connect with him in other than sexual ways.  That might help you get back into the "lover" mode.|`|qUhntdzvaa	OMG my wife is the same way.  We just had a baby in January. We haven't had sex since way before that and I sure don't want to mess her up if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  But it's so frustrating to me sometimes because she has NO desire to even TALK dirty to me or "help me" ease the tension.  Heck it's been MONTHS since we made love.<br>  <br>  Just know that your husband needs some sort of physical attention.  It's not a commodity or desire - it is a NEED.  Denying him this will make your marriage dwindle.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	You must be exhausted! 4 month old baby in the house.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing. Life at home doesn't really get back to "normal" until the kids start school, and you start to have a little more time to yourself, and once you've started sleeping again. <br>  <br>  Your body went through something pretty traumatic, I mean, you had a baby. It's perfectly normal to not be as "sexual" as you were before. What the two of you should do is talk to your doctor, together, about any concerns that you have, and how to overcome any discomforts. Your doctor can back you up on how you feel, and help your husband to understand what you are going through. It's also good to talk about in case you are experiencing the slightest form of baby blues, or PPD.<br>  <br>  Also, ask yourself why you're not in the mood. Are you tired? Are you uncomfortable with your post-baby body (like so many of us are)? Is it because the baby is always around? <br>  <br>  Have you had any alone time, as a couple, or individually since the arrival of your baby? This can do wonders. For months, I felt like I wasn't even myself, like I was watching from a distance, as my physical body, in a zombie like state, took care of the baby. You two need to reconnect with yourselves as individuals, not just parents, so that you can reconnect with each other. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on the birth of your child, and best wishes.|`|SRzswqTeaa	Completely normal.  You have higher estrogen levels.. things are dryer, and your drive goes out the window.   It's much harder to get in the mood.  I think it's just nature's way of saying "hey you just *had* a baby, let's not do *that* again"..lol  <br>  <br>  Please talk to your husband, let him know this is natural, and that it will really help to set the mood - and he will have to 'work' at getting you in the mood.  Have patience, try to be romantic, and be sensitive to one anothers wants and needs, without being demanding.  It works both ways.  You might have to give more than you want, but he needs to understand that it's not gonna be as frequent as it was before baby.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	My son is 5 months old and I still don't have any desire to have sex, I don't know I think it's normal the fear of getting pregnant again even if you are on BC is still very real, I have a friend whose daughter is over a year old and she still hasn't had sex with her husband she hasn't since she found out she was preggers.|`|27f7dde32d8db967d905ab68e1de0c2caa	If you are the person doing most of the child care then you are probably just too tired.  Adjusting to a baby can be exhausting, and you don't say whether your baby sleeps much at night, whether you are breastfeeding or work outside the home.  If the answers are "doesn't sleep through the night, "I'm breastfeeding" and/or "I work outside the home" then it isn't surprising your sex drive hasn't returned since a person can only do so much.|`|eJMIazhLaa	I'll tell you what.  I have a 4 yr old and a 19 month old and I haven't gotten my sex drive back since having my oldest.  I don't think that it normally takes that long, but some women do lose their sex drive after having a baby.  Mine is just too long so there's obviously something else going on there that I need to get checked out, but that's besides the point.  Yes, it is normal.|`|kuHE3z2Maa	Your body has been through so much. Trust me, it's completely normal and you'll more than likely return to your original libido. It just takes time. New moms are usually stressed and sleep deprived which kills the libido. I'm sorry that your husband isn't being very understanding.|`|lugtQ5oraa	I also just had a baby 4 months ago , and i feel that same way. I'm in that same boat as you are, i just do it to because i feel bad, cause i know how long it has been. Hes always reminding me oh we only did it once last month. I don't know what to tell you. Hopefully we get better in a few months. Good luck|`|OApLnJrsaa	I am expecting #3 currently.<br>  <br>  With my 1st - I couldn't wait till I got the dr's ok to go back to 'active duty' in the bedroom, however, after #2, I wanted nothing to do with it.  So I guess it just depends on hormones, moods, age, tiredness, etc.<br>  <br>  You could certainly mention it to your doc, but i dont think its anything to really worry about.  :-)|`|4Ikqt4YGaa	check out www.bbc.co.uk  or specificaly  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/having_a_baby/birth_sex.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/having_a_...</a> that has some pretty good infromation :-D
uFrqC4Y2aa	Maybe you're having ovulation cramps. For me these can be stronger some months more then others.|`|SRzswqTeaa	No, it's not possible from Monday.  At this point the sperm has just reached the egg (or will reach it by tomorrow as it can take up to 72 hours).  Then the egg (which is still in the fallopian tube), has to travel down to the uterus and implant.  It is not until implantation takes place that your body starts all the hormone changes.  Until then, nothing is connected to your body and it has no clue.  It can take up to 12 days for the fertilized egg to travel down the fallopian tube and implant in the uterine wall.  That is why it takes we have to wait until our missed period to take a pregnancy test.  It takes about 14 days for all of this to happen :-)
4WszPA0Paa	Ok i deleted my answer because it was very long but pretty much identical to specialcay's haha (except im not pregnant) so im just vouching what she says and nominate her for BA hehe<br>  <br>  Do NOT neglect nutrition and sleep... ask birth professionals about the YOGA exercises and nutrition but always sleep before 10-10:30pm while trying for 8ish hours... it's huge that you keep all three stable... after all it is your Future Family in that belly :)|`|NPmRmnG6aa	Walking, Swimming, and other light aerobic workouts. If you were not big into working out before you got pregnant I would take it easy. I just walk my dog everyday for like 25 to 30 mins.|`|SRmvOp0daa	I highly recommend prenatal yoga, if you can find a class in your area (or buy a video).  It involves many helpful stretches and toning that will assist you during labor.  I never did any yoga before I became pregnant, and I am so glad I started it (right around my 6th month!)  and you can do yoga right up until your due date.<br>  If this isn't something that you think you would like, some crucial exercises that most doctors will recommend are squats and leg lifts.  <br>  If you decide to walk, do NOT do more strenuous walking than you did pre-pregnancy (if you didn't run or power walk before, don't try it now).  Walking is great, but keep a slow, steady pace, and mind the surface you're walking on!  (walking outside for me right now isn't a smart choice because of the ice and snow on the roads)  Remember your balance is much different with the added weight, so be conscious of that!<br>  Several of my friends swear that swimming is the best exercise when pregnant, because you're weightless!  I myself haven't tried it, but I can imagine it would be great!<br>  Hope this helps, and good luck to you!|`|6ebc3QuFaa	First warning to bear in mind when it comes to exercise during pregnancy will always be to talk with your doctor for the approval of your exercise program even if it is only walking. However, for most women with low-risk pregnancy getting a safe healthy workout is easier by simply observing a few tips.<br>  <br>  The following are guidelines from The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommending first before anything else is to stay consistent, exercising regularly or at least having three workout sessions a week. Always keep track of your exercise program and do not do it on an intermittently basis.<br>  <br>  Any pregnancy fitness regimen must fall in the mild to moderate range and must be easy to do. Forget about those activities, which can strain your muscles and cause injuries, including but not limited to jumping motions or any sudden direction changes in your movements.<br>  <br>  Pregnant women must avoid exercise requiring lying flat on their backs and avoidance of prolonged motionless standing periods, particularly after the first trimester, because both of them are proven to reduce significantly blood flow to the uterus.<br>  <br>  Stop exercising every time you become fatigued even if the movement does not justify such fatigue. Oxygen is required for high exercise performance but pregnancy decreases your oxygen so this is normal, except if you are trying to workout out to a point near of exhaustion.<br>  <br>  Be aware of any exercise or activity that might cause loss of balance and even mild trauma to the abdomen. If you have a particular concern regarding an exercise, simply avoid it.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	<a href="http://www.gurgle.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gurgle.co.uk/</a>|`|bwlDJdtdaa	Power-walking is really good. Not sensible for under 3 months along and after 8
IAzCsvaNaa	i don't think they are accurate because last month i got my period and my husband and i have had bad luck TTC so i took ovulation tests during my period and 2weeks after and it said i wasnt ovulating. so i think they are not accurate.
ApyrV5J9aa	It is very possible for CM to differ from person to person and even from cycle to cycle. The cycle that I got pregnant I hardly had any EWCM but I had all of the other types. Watery CM is still considered fertile. After I ovulated I continued to have watery CM. I am now 12 weeks pregnant and I still have it. This was different from every other cycle. It is very possible that you ovulated this month without EWCM, especially since you had watery CM. If you haven't yet, I would suggest charting using FertiltyFriend.com. I really liked it and it taught me a lot about my ovulation. Anyways, Good luck to you!

j45Q2ipRaa	The pups will be fine as long as they are healthy and you are feeding them.  It is normal for some mom's to decide that this is the time to wean them although we know the timing could be better.  Keep up what you are doing and taking the vet's advice and you will continue to have wonderful pups.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	ask in the doggy section.|`|Wscsgyd5aa	It seems normal. Some mothers eat their puppy's. You are just going to have to step in and be the surrogate|`|a1uoxczTaa	two of my dogs just recently had puppies. both dogs had litters before, the pups r gone now but one dog would still be with her pups and check up on her pups rite up until they were 8 weeks old. my other dog was a very good mother too (a Min Pin) her other litters she was seriously protective and i had to drag her outside to use the bathroom but this last litter she lost complete interest. luckily my other dog stepped in (mini schnauzer) and was pretend mommy. the pups were about 4 weeks old, i noticed because one was constipated and it was because she wasnt paying attention to them or stimulating their bellies. i would constantly rub their bellies after feedings and hand feed them with formula or food. finely my other dog walked in one day and just started being mommy to them. i think depending on how many litters she has had it is normal. usually with the first litter they stay with them longer. this is the first time the Min Pin has done that. maybe u should try putting them in a crate or a closed in area together and see how she does. if she really is like growlin at them or constantly running to a different corner then them, you obviously have to be mommy.|`|87d8aafbd195fc80b4d30f12e7539f3faa	I think your in the wrong place, this is for questions for human babies and children not animals.|`|M1KYxcvSaa	You might try asking this in the pet section.
