I used the surface area formula of the double integral of dS where dS is the normal vector times dA.  For my normal vector (partial x, partial y, -1), I got   and I normalized it to get sqrt(2).  My formula then became double integral of sqrt(2) times dA.  Normally, I would just change to polar coordinates, but in this case, the cylinder's axis of rotation does not go through the original so I don't know how to set up the limits of integration.
20090227113824AAgcJif	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Pre-calculus graphing questions?	Hi.. can you explain these things to me?      1. Even and Odd functions. I believe even functions are symmetric? But what about Odd functions? Do they reflect across the origin? I guess what makes an even function is if you enter x or -x into the function, the y value is the same? What about for odd functions? If you enter x but then enter -x, you get -y back?       2. Are one-to-one functions the same as even functions? Is there another type of function that they teach you about when they teach you about one-to-one functions? I think there was, but I forgot what they were called.

20090227131528AAZIkgJ	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	What does the notation (a,n) = 1 mean?	I saw a question here:   If (a,n) = 1, prove that the congruence ax ≡ b (mod n) has exactly one solution t such that 0≤t = t2 in 0<=t1,t2<n, i.e. at1 = b mod n and at2 = b mod n. Then subtracting one from the other we get a(t1-t2) = 0 mod n. So n divides a(t1-t2). But (a,n) = 1 so n divides t1-t2. But since 0<=t1, t2 < n 0 <= t1-t2 < n, so t1 and t2 must be equal i.e. exactly one solution.      What does the notation (a,n) = 1 mean here? Thanks.

20090227161426AAhxsL2	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Impossibility of reaching light-speed seems illogical?	From a logical standpoint, it seems illogical that to reach a finite amount of speed requires infinte acceleration. It would seem more logical that to reach an infinite speed would require infinite acceleration. But, since the speed of light is not an infinte amount, reaching it shouldn't require infinite acceleration. Or else, even light wouldn't have reached its own current speed, seeing as how even light must have at one point (maybe before the big bang) been stationary or slower-moving. That means that it's possible, even if much more difficult, to accelerate an object to the speed of light. Could it be that the reason we believe it impossible to accelerate an object to light-speed is that our understanding of physics and mathematics is flawed?      I plan to devote my life to discovering a way of reaching and surpassing the "light barrier".

Your dog, Socks, is a terrier with shor black hair. When you pick him up you notice that Socks does not have hair on the bottom of him paws, rather he has sharp claws. Which statement below best explains the difference between the cells that produce Sock's hair or claws?      a. the cells that produce Socks' hair contain only the genes necessary for hair production. Likewise the cells that produce Socks claws contain only the genes necessary for producing claws      b. Bothe cell types contain the entire geome, but certain cells will only express certain genes.      c. The cells that produce their hair do not have the chromosomes that carry the claw genes and the cells that produce the claws do not have the chromosomes that carry the hair genes.      d. Socks claws are produced from a mutation in the hair gene that produces hair in all other cells on Socks skin      e. Because these two cells are completely different they have completely different genomes, therefore they make different proteins.

After boiling my brand new (tesco) kettle, I noticed an unusual odour emanating from within. I dismissed the reasons for this odour as the kettle eqivalent of "breaking-in" new shoes, so I decided, throwing caution to the wind, to proceed with the redolent water.   Later on, I noticed an instruction guide which contained a message advising the consumer to boil the kettle 2/3 times prior to use.   Why is this the case? Is it dangerous to use (as I have) the water from the very first boil?      Thanks in advance!;)

20090225102839AAde3jj	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	How do I apply Kepler's 3rd law as modified by Newton?	Johannes Kepler discovered a simple relationship between the average distance of a planet from the Sun (called its semi-major axis, A, measured in Astronomical Units) and the amount of time it takes a planet to orbit the Sun once (called its orbital period, P, measured in years). For objects orbiting the Sun, the semi-major axis to the third power equals the period squared:    A3 = P2       There were two problems with this relation. First, Kepler did not know how it worked, he just knew it did. Second, the relation does not work for objects which are not orbiting the Sun, for example, the Moon orbiting the Earth. Isaac Newton solved both these problems with his Theory of Gravity, and discovered that the masses of the orbiting bodies also play a part. Newton developed a more general form of what was called Kepler's Third Law that could apply to any two objects orbiting a common center of mass. This is called Newton's Version of Kepler's Third Law:       M1 + M2 = A3 / P2       (here is the law, i just don't understand how to make an example)

20090225103752AAiO3Ht	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Titration of aspirin with 0.5M NaOH?	Hi, can someone help me with this chemistry lab question?      Calculate the volume of 0.5 M NaOH that will be required to titrate a 0.15g sample of aspirin.      So far I've taken this equation:      NaOH + C9H8O4 ----> H2O + [C9H7O4]- [Na]+      and calculated moles of aspirin - 0.15g / 180.15 g = 0.0008 moles aspirin.  Since the moles of NaOH and aspirin in the equation are equal, I assumed that at the end of the titration, moles NaOH = moles aspirin.  This led me to do 0.0008 moles NaOH / 0.5 M = 0.16 mL - however, this answer seems too small.  Can anyone point out what I did wrong?      Thanks in advance!
