The recession will be over before the teeny boppers stop mooning over Edward Cullen|`|C9OlH7xdaa	Dear, you do realise that this is the travel section? People are well within their rights to ask such questions.    You are completely incorrect in stating that there is 'Nothing on offer'    Pretty much the whole world is in recession and people are simply wondering if they could be offered a better deal in Ireland.|`|q9PVawNyaa	Sorry but has everyone forgotten that this is the travel section. What do you expect? Those questions are irritating but they are what the section is meant for. You don't need to open them.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You're right. But there are also plenty of questions relating to moving to other countries.     It's just a pity that people don't realise that at the moment it's tough everywhere.|`|2hAuIg5baa	omg i no but what annoys me more is the people who think getting a job wont be a problem because theyv gone to college, and they get snotty when you tell them it doesnt matter how many qualifications they have THERE IS NO JOBS!!  if i see another question from somebody asking about moving here or asking if theres any jobs im going to scream!! and of all the places theyd want to move to? one of the most expensive countrys in the in the world in the middle of a reccession were buisnesses are closing down left right and center!  people are sooo dumb and they annoy me!!!!!!|`|COSvrQUcaa	Omigosh ya!!!

Do people not think these q might have been asked before?!|`|3Tlq60FTaa	Oh god yeah, like why do all these ppl think that moving to Ireland is like the best thing on earth !!!    There's nothing here, especially at the moment. It's just ridiculous!!|`|XxSj6AsBaa	A couple of relevant points:  I am (as my screen name implies) an American.  I lived and worked in Ireland for a while.  Unless you have lived both places, it might be difficult to understand why others might want to move there.  I made a true effort to fit in when I lived there and got on quite well.  I think I would take a work assignment there again in a heartbeat.  Nothing wrong with my own country, it is awesome in many ways.  Ireland too is awesome, but in some different ways.    My second point has sort-of been made by a previous respondent.  As this is the travel section, you might expect questions along these lines.  In the grand scheme of things, most of the questions on Y/A are not all that brilliant.  We need not answer them.                                                              Cheers.|`|Ssn0ojAGaa	Yes Tid, it is quite irritating. I can understand that they want an Irish persons point of view on certain things. But, I mean, does anybody use the search engine on yahoo answers anymore? Some questions have been asked like hundreds of times up here.  Is Ireland a third world country and questions about Leprechauns and such. Lucky for me nobody seems to have asked my question. I wonder why that is?    Edit: Asking questions that have been asked before are  irritating, not the fact that they are Travel Questions. It is a Travel section at the end of the day. And of course you do not have to answer these questions. I know I don't. This is a problem in every section in Yahoo answers. There is a seach engine for a reason.|`|AA12022384	That silly recession has hit Ireland very badly, large numbers of businesses going bust, high levels of unemployment, government constantly looking for ways to make cutbacks (another term for shedding jobs). Many of those here are leaving to look for work elsewhere.    I know Ireland is the green isle but the grass is really not greener here at the moment.    Also all they are talking about on the radio, television and newspapers  is "that silly recession" and if there is one thing the Irish can do it is talk, there is no getting away from it here.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	You're forgetting that this is the travel section. There are the exact same questions in every other travel section for every other country.     It's not like it is the same person asking the same questions over and over. They are new people with legitimate travel questions about Ireland. It's new to them. No need to be hostile to people using the section for it's intended use.I am sure natives of other countries are just as annoyed by hearing the same questions over and over from tourists. Have you never had a question about travel yourselves?    Just don't answer them if you don't want to help  - problem solved.
23vKOyBraa	I'd actually ask for 2 seats in front, and 2 behind - that way you can move people around as they start to fight and argue. If you're all in one row you can still see each other and throw thing etc.    You're going to need a lot of things though - that's one helluva long and boring flight. Get each girl to carry their own carry on bag and get them to pack what they think they will need. I observed one kid playing happily on an extended flight with tennis ball only - nothing else. He was happy.    Get the girls involved now (maybe not the 2 yo obviously), get them thinking about the trip etc.    The airlines generally give kids some kind of pack to play with, but don't count on it.|`|rpSP0qrQaa	I did the long-haul from London to NZ and back in the summer I cannot deny that things get pretty tedious by the time you get past half way.    My best advice is to keep yourself awake with movies for the first half/leg of the journey, then try and sleep the whole of the second. Well, this depends on time zones, your time of departure and arrival, etc, but basically you want to force yourself into the right sleep pattern straight away.    Drink lots of water but don't eat too much.    Flight socks are a must, but make sure you still get up and move about often. You'll find people congregating at the back of the plane as there's usually some room to move around a bit here.    Its also quite good to have a chat with people - find out where they're going (or returning home to), chat about your destination, etc. Just breaks up the boredom a bit for both you and the person you're chatting to, especially its night time and you can't sleep. You can get to feel quite isolated otherwise.    As for your sisters, they will probably be a little intimidated by the idea of a 24 hour flight and so not quite know what to do with themselves. Chances are they will just follow your example and do whatever you do.    The on-demand in flight entertainment systems are very good nowadays and so hopefully they might become occupied with movies and forget about annoying each other.      Enjoy it!  It always seems worth it when you get there.|`|Tcwru3eDaa	in this situation you should fly on a jumbo so you could sit in the three and put the 7 and 4 beside each other and your 14 year old can sit on her own at a 2 beside somebody she doesnt know but make sure shes across from u     p.s good luck,enjoy the vacation!

The FBT Sports Complex on Ramkhamhaeng is also a great place for football shirts, they have very good quality football shirts with excellent prices and seven floors of nothing but sporting goods and sportswear.

Rl1Qqcqzaa	The answer is "None" because there is no such thing as a "messianic Jew"  People who call themselves "messianic Jews" are actually Christians, not Jews.  If you don't believe me, just as ANY rabbi (except, of course, don't ask any of those Christian ministers who deceptively call themselves 'messianic rabbis') and you will find out I am telling nothing but the absolute truth.    Messianic Jews"  are nothing more than a bizarre Christian cult who refuse to acknowledge that they are Christians and instead insist they are Jews. While they do things outwardly that may appear to be Jewish to someone who does not know much about Judaism, their beliefs are totally incompatible with and contrary to the beliefs found in Judaism. Instead of following the tenants of Judaism, they (1) worship Jesus, (2) believe in virgin birth, (3) believe that sins are atoned by human sacrifice, (4) believe in the divinity of Jesus, (5) believe that Jesus was the son of God, (6) read, study, and follow the New Testament, etc., etc., etc--all these things and much more that they do and believe in are Christian and, as should be obvious to anyone who knows anything about Judaism, none of these things are Jewish. Therefore, calling themselves Jews as they do is nothing but FRAUDULENT, DECEPTIVE, and DESPICABLE. It is sickening and pathetic how they insert THEIR Christianity into all of OUR holidays and holy days and claim the result is Judaism. What they are doing as far as Judaism is concerned is nothing less than blasphemy.    No Jew on earth accepts them as being any part of our religion in any way. They should be denounced by everyone who stands up for righteousness and honor and truthfulness--not of course because they believe in Jesus--but instead because they make a mockery of Judaism by claiming Judaism is something other than what it is. No Jew worships anyone other than one God, a God who did not have a son sent to earth, born to a virgin, died on the cross, rose again, etc. etc. etc as is believed by Christians. Period. The Christian New Testament is NOT part of our bible. Period.    They, including their fraudulent "messianic rabbis" are living a lie by calling themselves Jews. All sane, rational people, no matter what their religion happens to be, know these people are NOT Jews (except for the "messianic Jews" themselves).|`|jnG8sOzWaa	i hope NONE|`|MPX0f5jzaa	I get the joke!    The answer is none.  People there don't lie about their identities, they call themselves Christians like they should.    I don't know what you Messianic Jews are so embarrassed about being called Christian.|`|YSK2PbAEaa	The term is misleading.    I have not noticed the increase you describe in the number of (Christians who call themselves) "Messianic Jews."    I think that many of us are intelligent enough to recognize these people as missionaries trying to steal Jewish souls.  But they represent a danger to our people and should be shown as what they really are.      .|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	none. there's no such thing as a messianic jew. those are christians. if you believe jesus was the messiah, you are christian. it's as simple as that.    have some respect. would it make sense for me to run around claiming i'm christian but i don't believe in jesus? no, that would be as stupid as saying that someone is jewish if they believe in christ.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Alot of people wanted to be Moshiach but weren't. Jesus wouldn't have been any different than anyone else. Scripturally he didn't cut the mustard. Google Nathan of Gaza you'll read another false Moshiach story. I basically explain like this.    Scripturally Abraham's seed was to inhabit the ends of the earth. The New World wasn't discovered by Columbus yet. Now we've finally gone to the ends of the earth and back again. OK we are starting now.    Did you hear about the 666 Christian down in Florida claiming he's G-d? Some people believe him but golly he's not going by scripture either as he's not even Jewish from David's line. It has to be by Jewish interpretation as other people don't quite understand the text and made too many re-writes and made things up. It also has to be majority of Jewish people have to view it that way. Nobody goes by the minority person and what they think and certainly not believe the word of an unqualified individual.    Cannot change one iota of meaning of the text sorry just to suit what one wants to believe. It has to actually happen according to scripture. If Jewish people say he wasn't Moshiach, he wasn't Moshiach, we will recognize the Moschiach and everyone will know. Everyone is free to speak their opinion but only in combined opinion does it make it so.  People that believe in Jesus are Christians, and not Jews, and that is what majority of what Jewish people believe.  Stop trying to fight Judaism, in doing so it doesn't reserve your "special spot" but actually makes it down to the bottom of the heap.  To be more inline with Judaism try studying Noahide, those are righteous Gentiles, where a "nice spot" has already been prepared.|`|VRl1jENHaa	In 2006, the Israeli census indicated that there were only 28,000 Messianic Jews there (as per Israeli guidelines, they are counted as "Christians").  I was not able to find updated data, because Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics website isn't working well.    EDIT:  @ Annt Hu DeShalit:  I almost gave you a thumbs-down, because of your incorrect remarks about Messianic Jews.  But you're against the JPA and the JPAA, so I'll cut you some slack.  And I LOVE your remark "avoid anyone who claims to be Jewish and is allied with pagans."  It always AMAZES me that the JPA/JPAA doesn't realize that it makes a mockery out of Judaism.    SECOND EDIT:  @ Mr. Natural -- you are only partially correct; outside Messianic orgainzations cannot travel to Israel for the purpose of evangelization.  HOWEVER, ISRAELI Messianics CAN and DO evangelize there legally.    THIRD EDIT:  @ Annt Hu DeShalit:  we'll see which of us has more to learn.  And I pray you learn it.|`|5e4gELFHaa	I think u r Jewish, cuz u call urself yeshua instead of Joshua|`|eyJqrqn7aa	None.  The two witnesses have to come first;|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Since this is indeed the Israel Travel section, I am addressing my response to the Jews.    Stay away from anybody who pushes "Messianic Judaism."  That is just a missionary trick to get you to become a Christian.    Look out for anyone who refers to "Yeshua."  This is a trick to avoid using the name "Jesus," so that these missionaries imply that they are not pushing Christianity, when of course they are.    You will note that no legitimate Christian group uses this name for Jesus.  Nor does any legitimate Jewish group.    Jesus is called Yeshu Hanotzri in Hebrew.    YeshuAH does indeed mean salvation in Hebrew.  But that is not relevant, except to missionaries out to capture Jewish souls.    Also beware of people calling themselves JPA or JPAA.    This warned, you must get closer to the Jewish religion.  Learn the sources, study, pray, eat only kosher food.    Get in contact with a local Orthodox rabbi or with the Habad (Chabad) movement.    Avoid anyone who claims to be Jewish and is allied with pagans.  The giveaway is their use of the abbreviation JPA.    ====    Ed.  Suzanne, if you don't know that the so-called "Messianic Jews" are just plain Xtians, then you have a lot to learn.    The JPAs are angels in comparison with these masquerading gentiles.  They should be ashamed of themselves.    .|`|AlbJmy7aaa	There are at least 2 there.    I met one in a taxi.

There is no rapture & this is a despicable doctrine that zips the so called believers out of here & leaves the Jews to face  the music again. This doctrine is extremely anti-semetic.|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	"awsome stuff. they will be raptured, and most of the world will be left behind at the tribulation."    another reason to not follow the christian way. the way i was taught we do not take delight in the sufferings of others.  i don't share your beliefs on anything but if i really thought  a time would come where some people would be safe and others would suffer...i would hope i wouldn't be so "gleeful" at the prospect.  that's pretty disgusting but it does explain so much of what i see and experience from so many.

I think its one of the safest places on earth. Only the foreign mafias (russian, albanian, turkish, serbian) show violent behavior.    The last president of the jewish community (Michel Friedman) show great average German behavior since he booked hotel rooms together with whores and sniffed cocaine.    Yes we have some Nazis, but actualy many of them supports the genocide on the Palestinian people and are sympathizing with the Neonazis in Israel (hard to believe but you can see some youth people waving Naziflags and killing Muslims in Tel Aviv - google for it).    If you look ordothox, keep away from east-german country side - you will miss nothing - but on some economic death areas people support national racist behavior.|`|CwHdua13aa	i think you are the 3894185112154`s person who asks this on yahoo.....how about reading all the other questions then you would notice that every thread has the same answer to your question.....|`|0RjZ4tCZaa	The leader of Germanys boomtown is Jewish - why should people care?

Probably not, because I'm more used to Rock'n'Roll than to that traditional "Kletschmer" sound.    But on the other hand: I don't dance to Bavarian folk music either. And I am Bavarian.    --  edit:  @Dennis, you're probably right, but sincerely, I never mated a Jewish girl here in Germany. Or if she was Jewish, I didn't know. We're usually talking about sex in my country, not religion.

AA11732565	More so lately cause they have new energy and have been winning.<br>  But, Boston is really RedSox nation. Patriots (even with Tom Brady) is second, followed by teh Celtics and Bruins on the bottom.

If it is not a connecting flight and you are planning to stay the night in Charlotte, you will have to re-check your bags when you fly out again. If it is a connecting flight, then you do not need to re-check your bags because they will be waiting to board your plane with you.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	No.|`|JXJvxhZPaa	Not if it's just a layover.

Italy is beautiful, you really should see it.
Jm3vMKx3aa	No, not in general.<br>  American citizens are visa waived for most of the Central American countries for tourist travel between 30 and 180 days. <br>  To live and work in any foreign country would require a residence and work permit which would also be the basis for buying property.

0rfojt9Paa	I have been to almost every country in Europe twice. I have traveled round the world. I would ask yourself and family do you want to address a historical movement or experience a completely different culture. If it is culture, I would pick somewhere in Asia or Africa. I loved South Africa and Thailand. If it is history, I would pick Europe because of the arts, war, and architecture (castles, rivers [Rhine] art museums, etc.) I loved Austria because, in some ways, it resembles Germany but is much more refined and you can go Mozart’s birth house and go on the Sound of Music tour in Salzburg and take a train to Vienna. My second favorite place is Amsterdam. You can go see the Anne Frank House, pot is legal, and it is a place to wonderful for words, but I could never be expressed in words or pictures. I love German because of the castles and the Eagles Nest (Hitler’s Home).  I had a summer home in Germany. Spain is amazing too. You are very lucky that you have a choice to pick any destination in the world. You are one of my contacts so feel free to e-mail me, but I noticed you do not have an e-mail address option in your profile so I won’t be able to e-mail you back. <br>  <br>  I hope my post has been insightful.|`|VPgL649Vaa	go to greece.<br>  england is the just the same as canada or usa<br>  germany is the same as england.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bergoiata.org/fe/scenes-avif/DOT_Scenery_07_Milos_Island_Greece.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bergoiata.org/fe/scenes-avif/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://travel.webshots.com/photo/2520994630050154950IhmErc" rel="nofollow">http://travel.webshots.com/photo/2520994...</a>|`|Gs0jtsebaa	Go to Italy.

vvmxooiQaa	Madrid définitivement car il y a beaucoup plus de choix qu'à Barcelone et surtout les prix sont en général beaucoup moins chers mais il te faudra peut-être marcher un peu plus alors qu'à Barcelone, le shopping est principalement concentré dans quelques zones ou axes principaux : le barrio gotico, l'Eixample (avec le fameux Paseo de Gracia qui serait un peu l'équivalent des Champs élysées de Paris mais aussi la Rambla Catalunya que personnellement je préfère). Arrivée au bout du Paseo de Gracia tu peux continuer sur Diagonal si tu préfères les boutiques de luxe ou au contraire continuer sur la Gracia pour trouver pleins de petites boutiques parfois intéressantes de quelques créateurs. <br>   <br>  Personnellement, je te déconseillerai San Sebastien pour du shopping car c'est une ville extrêmement chère mais en revanche, pour le tourisme, c'est une "petite" ville agréable et pleine de charme.|`|4Cu4EQPaaa	Barcelone, costa daurada|`|6Wx45Yxpaa	Une pierre deux coup, pourquoi pas!

Unique et merveilleuse  par son originalité (119 mètre de haut) et son point de vue extraordinaire (le bassin et le banc d'Arguin à l'est, la foret des landes Girondines à l'ouest). Ensuite tu peux te rendre dans les petits villages de pécheur à Arcachon ou prés du cap Ferret (le plus connu étant le village de l'herbe). Sur le cap ferret, il ne faut pas rater la pointe du cap. Le plus facile pour s'y rendre est encore la traversée en bateau. (tu pourras ainsi découvrir l'?le aux oiseaux et les 2 cabanes Tchanquée). N'oublies pas de venir faire une visite à Bordeaux qui vient d'être très justement reconnue au patrimoine mondiale de l'unesco. Enfin, avec un peut plus de temps et une voiture, tu peux découvrir St Emilion ou le médoc avec sa célèbre route des vins. <br>  Bonne visite et bienvenu chez nous.|`|04dcc767964beb6a39939f59710d0560aa	La dune du Pyla bien s?r! une curiosité à ne pas rater! la plus haute dune d'Europe! <br>  Pour les campings, je ne sais pas, essaie le site de l'office de tourisme d'Arcachon: <a href="http://www.arcachon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.arcachon.com/</a><br>  (moi j'habite Bordeaux rive droite)|`|fc348f9579fcdd892e1dc80ee9f034cfaa	7|`|xUVgykVIaa	la dune du Pila a monter et descendre vingt fois dans la journée je l'ai fait pari stupide mais c'est grandiose.|`|ykRV4hF5aa	Il faut aussi visiter les landes intérieures (mont de marsan,...).

lXINl2braa	Ryoanji is not a bad walk from kinkakuji (The Golden Pavilion). Maybe about 10 minutes or so. I would highly recomend that as a destination. It is a zen rock garden and also has other garden features that are astounding as well. They are both in what is known as North Western Kyoto. <br>  <br>  Nijo-jo (Nijo-catsle) is really amazing. It is a large complex with a nice garden. I am sure you will enjoy it. That is located in Central Kyoto. Honestly there is not too much super close but it's near Kyoto Tower and station which are modern but impressive. <br>  <br>  To be honest I like what is known as Eastern Kyoto. Kiyomizu-dera is famous for it's large deck and view of Kyoto. It is full of lovely momiji (Japanese maple trees) and there is a nice tea house and many small shops on the approach up the hill to it. Yasaka Shrine, Ginkakuji (The silver pavilion), Sanjusanden-do, and too many others that I can't think of right now are all a very enjoyable walk in that area. Gion is also in that area. It is famous for Geiko (Geisha) and Maiko (Apprentice Geiko). Sometimes you may catch a glympse of them as they walk around though it is pretty rare. Sometimes you see tourists dressed as them but it's fun too.<br>  <br>  In Nara you must buy some cookies to feed the deer it can be a little scary because they tend to rush over to you but it's fun. They are very tame and you will see them all over. Take your time and walk around Nara Park, I assume you will probably go to Tpdai-ji it's the most popular place in Nara. Kofuku-ji is just a brief walk from it and features a nice pagoda. Make sure to walk around that area well. You will see a nice pond filled with tons of turtles and you can get a nice photo of the pagoda from it.<br>  <br>  If you have any problems the Police are very helpful though most don't speak too much English they will make every effort. You will find Koban (Mini police posts) around. Also many people will help you if you are lost. Try to learn some basic Japanese like where is it?, exscuse me, how much is it? and you can pretty much accomplish anything.<br>  <br>  If you are going in Winter be ready for cold! Kyoto has a pretty cold Winter.<br>  <br>  Add on: Oh April should be pretty nice. You might see Sakura. Many of the shrines and temples have night viewings of the cherry blossoms. These are super popular so they often have long lines but it's worth it as they are amazing. I would also keep on eye out for the Osaka Mint Sakura viewing. The date changes each year but they open the area near the mint in Osaka with lots of cherry tree's in bloom and all kinds of booths and stuff. It's pretty amazing. It is not far from Kyoto in fact you will go through Osaka if you arrive at Kansai international. Osaka-jo (Castle) is very cool as well.|`|skGu85s0aa	I'd definitely go to Silver pavilion, and Heian Shrine and its garden full of cherry trees which hopefully will be in blossom by April. And　Sanjūsangen-dō which has the one thousand life-size statues of the Thousand Armed Kannon.<br>  <br>  Asashiyama area with the famous bamboo grove is also unmissable, as is  shrine in Kurama, but those two are bit far from central Kyoto - but if you have time, it's worth it.|`|TS596bTbaa	If you will be sick of Japanese temples, I recommend to spend some time in Kyoto Station.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Station" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Stati...</a><br>  <br>  It's modern and beautiful architecture, and it contains many stores and delicious restaurants. You would find a lot of cute items as your souvenirs.|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	Kiyomizu Temple is okay.<br>  <br>  I suggest you go to San-juu-san gendo. I personally think it's a lot more impressive and interesting. <br>  <br>  I haven't been there yet, but I am planning to visit Ryoanji Temple. It's a Zen Buddhist Temple, and they have one of the famous rock gardens there.|`|w4sL6EuFaa	You should buy the Lonely Planet for Japan.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/Primary/Product/Destination_Guides/Country/Asia/PRD_PRD_2022/Japan+Travel+Guide.jsp?bmUID=1224650815273" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/Primary/Pro...</a><br>  <br>  You can also find it from other sites, or you could download just the Kyoto chapter if you would like.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Kiyomizu-dera temple is must go in Kyoto. If it is autumn colored leaves season so-called Ko-Yo or Momiji, you'd better try to drop Arashiyama, Nanzen-ji temple, Tofuku-ji temple, Ohara-Sanzenin temple, Kifune Jinjya shrine  ect where the mountain or trees  turned to red, yellow and orange. The season is around November.<br>  <br>  One thing for sure is Kyoto or Nara, many temple requre you entering commision or donation. You have to prepare small coins a lot. Sometimes, it costs about US$10 for entering inside temple. A few temple are only admission free.<br>  <br>  You can use public transportation to and fro but better take taxi to spend time rationally.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kyoto.travel/infomation/images/map_of_kyoto_j.pdf#search='Kyoto" rel="nofollow">http://www.kyoto.travel/infomation/image...</a> sightseeing map'<br>  <br>  |`|cMZEmpp0aa	Kiyomizu-dera. You MUST go see it. It's definitely within walking distance of the train station, though I will warn you that it is up a hill so be prepared for that when you go.<br>  <br>  By the time I visited Kyoto I spoke a little Japanese, but nothing near fluency. Major signs usually have place names written in both Japanese and English, and most of the places I went for meals had bilingual menus (there was one place where "bilingual" meant Japanese and Italian) and/or plenty of pictures. Your hotel will probably have some staff members who speak at least a little English, and I did manage to find some shops where the people spoke and understood English too. In all, I don't think you have to be worried about not speaking Japanese. You might feel a bit more secure if you carry a traveler's bilingual phrase book, though. I think mine is from Lonely Planet and it's quite good. <br>  <br>  If you're going during the summer, bring sunscreen with a high SPF and either bring or buy a small folding fan, a parasol, and a small towel to tuck in your purse. It gets incredibly hot there in July and August, and those items saved me so much discomfort you wouldn't believe it. You should also have a good pair of walking shoes.<br>  <br>  And of course, bring a camera with lots of film or a huge memory card :)

818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	You may visit most countries as a tourist for 3 to 6 months..each country has its own regulations.  But, to live and work there you need a special visa.  Each country has its own regulations for this too.  You need to go to the website of the embassy of that country to your country and research the visa requirements.  Work visas are always very difficult to get as every country wants to protect its job market for its own citizens.  Generally, you must have at least a 4 yr. degree and much needed job skills, and find an employer to sponsor your work visa in order to work and live in a foreign country.  Citizenship, if you want it there, takes several years. You must apply to immigrate, become a"permanent resident", then apply for citizenship.  This process usually takes between 5 and 10 years.  See site below and study everything about visas, and living and working in Iceland.

Environmental progress. Communism was horrible and not only destroyed lives but the environment. The pollution that was present in much of east Germany was horrible, the cars and factories belching out tons of soot and black smoke, the dead rivers and streams, raw sewage spilling into the rivers. The DDR cared nothing about the environment. When I first traveled into old east Germany in 1990 what I saw was horrible, I could not believe it. <br>  2. Improved living standards. In 1990 when I first freely crossed into eastern europe it was like stepping back in time. Building still had bullet holes in them from WW2. It was like stepping back 40 years. Most houses were heated from coal and in the winter the black soot would cover everything and the sulfur would burn your eyes and choke a person. Although it took 20 years for the majority of people the living standards have increased. <br>  3. A unified Germany is once again a powerful force in Europe. No longer the crippled child, it is again a serious force to be reckoned with, economically, militarily& politically. German can be a strong stabilizing factor in Europe. <br>  <br>  BAD<br>  1. Financail cost. The cost of unification is/was & will be greater than the experts thought. The assumption of the DDR debt, the "aide to the Soviet union" the outstanding WW2 debt owed by the DDR. the "Holocaust debt" to survivors, the assumption of millions of people with really nothing, the repatriationiotation of property back to the last originally owners, (Property was illegally taken for legal owners first by the Nazi and again by the communist, and given to others) the assumption of millions of people without real savings, jobs, retirements, health insurrance, unemployement inssurance etc. was a huge undertaking. <br>  2. Political, With malice towards none. The DDR did many very bad things, nearly as bad as the Nazi's personl freedom and individual rights were sudsequent to the needs of the state, and the political ambitions of the members of the powers that be. Under reunification many people were forgiven there tresspassings. Many people were giving a second chance. And are taking it and doing what the did before but with a new twist. The communist party and the various "nazi" partys are refroming and gaining momentum and influence in the German political body. This influence slowes down and polutes the reunifcation, disfranchises more people and creates greater indignation. <br>  3. The end of the cold war. Although the end of the cold war was good the cold war did have a number of benifits. 2 superpower competed against one another but basiclly decided to live with one another, rules of play were established, and control was exersized. It was bad but it was balanced. Now that control is gone. Fractions around the world are making power plays and in a sense the world is not as safe as it once was. The cold war was bad but it was stabil, and controlled. <br>  <br>  Freedom is not free, nor is it given, it must be discovered, nurtured, and passed on, by every generation. |`|c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	good:<br>  - no killing any more at the East/West border<br>  - shiny happy people all around at 9th November, 1989<br>  - end of the "Russian Empire", thanks to Mikhail Gorbatchev<br>  <br>  bad:<br>  - economic downfall of what once was the FRG (West Germany)<br>  - surveillance state becoming hypercritical (not hypo, I wish it were); Stasi methods getting introduced<br>  - Angela Merkel|`|c47f8df8d8d2e4f16d8365876cfd3267aa	"Good" and "bad" are value judgments and therefore never "facts".

VyaLntI6aa	It's not only an airline rule ... it's an FAA mandate that all persons over the age of two must have their own seat.  If you are caught with a child over two on your lap, you & the airline face fines up to $10,000.  Granted, you would only be caught if there happens to be an FAA observer on the flight ... but why risk it?<br>  <br>  If the airline employee is anything like I was, i.e. I did my job correctly, they will ask for proof of age for the child.  If they cannot provide POA, they will have to purchase a seat for the child anyway.<br>  <br>  The airline I worked for allowed you to purchase the child's seat for the same price as yours (even if it's an advance fare and it was no longer available); some airlines make you purchase a full-fare ticket.<br>  <br>  Even though you can hold a child under two on your lap for a flight, it is really safer & more comfortable to have them occupy their own seat in an airline-approved carseat (which most carseats are ... it will have a sticker on it saying so).<br>  <br>  Oh, I just remembered ... even if her second child was under two, she can only hold ONE baby on her lap (I'm guessing that she's flying alone with the two kids?) ... so she will have to purchase a ticket anyway.  Tell her to call the airline and see if they can get a ticket for the same fare as what she paid.|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	Most airlines require that you bring proof of a child's age when your child is flying as a "lap child." He may get away with it, but most likely will have to show proof of the child's age and since he probably won't want to show the true age of the child, will most likely have to buy a seat. Some people. BTW, it's two years and under who fly free, not until you reach three.|`|zcZGRPc2aa	um well, being caught isnt neccesarly going to get them in trouble, they will just have to buy another seat. and it depends on the airline they are flying with also. and technically if the child is not yet 3 then they are still considered a 2 year old even if they are a month from being 3

Saludos|`|EJLKnPFMaa	No olvides llevarte comprobantes de ingresos y/o lavar tu BMW antes de pasar la frontera, porque si no te podrían poner peros para entrar más allá de las 50 millas.<br>  A parte de esto, sí considera 12 horas hasta la frontera. De 1 a 2 horas de cruce fronterizo. 16 horas más hasta Atlanta. O sea, unas 30 horas.<br>  En costos, por gasolina en México estima 150 litros @ 7.20 = 1080 pesos. En  Estados Unidos considera 200 litros @ 14.50 = 2900. Deberás considerar ponerle al menos un litro de aceite porque se te desgastará más rápido el que lleves, si no paras.<br>  De casetas en México pon unos 500 pesos. Las más caras son las de Monterrey - Nuevo Laredo. En general casi no hay casetas en esa ruta. De Laredo a Atlanta supongo no hay.<br>  En total, casi 5000 pesos más los alimentos y el agua, más 30 horas.

Solo le pides que te baje en Periferico, en la esquina de Rio Magdalena y Periferico, ahi veras la glorieta con el hasta bandera y la comercial mexicana, el sanborns y el sams, ahi es la direccción que buscas.<br>  Si usas esta ruta de regreso tomas el mismo transporte y la misma via de regreso por el metro.<br>  Ahi tu decides pero como veras, esta ruta del metro como que es mas complicada y sobre todo das mas vuelta e inviertes mas tiempo.<br>  <br>  espero te sirva y mucha suerte|`|EJLKnPFMaa	El más cercano es Barranca del Muerto, pero después hay que tomar un transporte por Av.

That includes almost all of the "answers" so far and the ones from BluedogGirl & Kayla C.<br>  <br>  New Orleans made the news after Katrina because drug dealers who returned to the city were fighting iver turf and the competition was literally deadly. That drove up the murder rate, which is still high.  However, almost 98% of serious violent crime in NOLA (murders & shootings) happens within the drug community (mostly due to crack cocaine) and the other 2% are "domestic" incidents.  That doesn't make the crimes OK, but the average resident or tourist does not have to worry about it.  <br>  <br>  Other crime in New Orleans is at or below the national average, and it was also like that before Katrina.<br>  <br>  It is NOT necessary to only travel in packs or stay indoors after dark, as suggested by other "answers".  <br>  <br>  .... And I have been "stumbling around the French Quarter at 2:00am" for years and never had a problem. Just stay away from people who say they want to sell you something illegal (don't go with them) and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Also, the flooded areas that have not recovered are NOT dangerous. They do look bad and that tends to scare people, but I have yet to see anyone who was robbed by a vacant house. Note that the areas tourists normally visit (the French Quarter, Uptown, Central Business District, Warehouse District, Garden District, etc.) did not flood and you can't tell Katrina ever happened.<br>  <br>  All you need do in New Orleans to stay safe is use the very basic common sense required in every city in the world.  <br>  <br>  Do stay in the French Quarter, Central Business District, or Warehouse District as those are the most conveneient and attractive areas for hotels.  Of the 3 areas I would stay in the FQ.<br>  <br>  Some of my other answers include suggestions for things to do in New Orleans.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a good trip!|`|mbV5UY3aaa	I completely agree with NOLAguy. He always seems to have the best answers when it comes to NOLA! :) New Orleans is a wonderful place to visit. (I've even thought about moving there myself.) My last trip there was in August. I went because my ex-husband was getting re-married that week and I just wanted to be somewhere far, far away to avoid feeling depressed. I can relate to your thoughts and feelings about wanting to get out and keep your mind off of your loss. NOLA is the perfect place to do it!<br>  <br>  I think it is definitely safe for you to travel to NOLA alone. You just have to be alert and aware of your surroundings. I'd recommend staying in the French Quarter because there's so much to do and see there and you can take the street car to other areas of the city when you want to. It's very inexpensive. <br>  <br>  Whenever I visit New Orleans I take a copy of Frommer's travel guide for the city. You can buy it on-line. It will help you decide where to stay, where to eat, and what to see during your travels. There are so many tours avaiable--you will have a blast! Don't be afraid to go on tours alone. I've seen a number of people out by themselves when I've been there. People are very friendly and helpful. You just have to use common sense like you would in any big city. The tourist areas are well patrolled. Good luck! You will LOVE NOLA! |`|lcCIJG5Iaa	New Orleans is safe much to the contrary of what other people say. Just stick to the well-traveled tourist areas, especially at night. There's a lot to do in the CBD over a weekend and if you do get bored, you can always find a tour guide to go look at the blighted areas of the city or go on a swamp tour. |`|f4f2ef1ae62f13b5107d7493e0f1b116aa	  The crime rate is fairly high. I go there alot but not alone. You can get a cab to take you want to go would be safe. It is when you are on a dark street with very few people that you have to worry about. On streets like Bourbon and Decatur there is always people there so you will be ok. If a homeless person approaches you just ignore them, they usually leave you alone. Look for a restaurant called Coops' on Decatur, place looks nasty but the BEST food in New Orleans!!!!! Have Fun, Be Safe.|`|b0qKOoBRaa	Traveling alone anywhere is not very safe.  Not to mention you would probably feel better if you had some company to keep you having fun not thinking about things too much.  My best friend lost a child and I know it can be hard to think about other things, but you have to move on with your life and leave the past where it is.|`|bb5b33986fbe9043ace45fe01e89d509aa	i wouldnt go alone, i live just outside of new orleans....the crime is bad, yes, even in the french quarter....esp. at night. its still a fun place to go party and everything but def a place to go in a group...there is a lot, A LOT of damage left over from katrina, but as long as you stay right off canal st, and near the french quarter u will be ok!! its a ton of fun and has lots of charm! just be careful!|`|AA10159260	New Orleans has a horrendous crime rate. It is still a very good place to visit and November is a great time to visit. If you take advantage of the deal, stay only on Bourbon and Royal in the quarter, take guided tours and stay on the mail drag. Don't get off in any side areas......very dangerous.|`|14d06f54b53b18d569944344b54028e3aa	The last I have seen on the news, the crime rate in New Orleans is still high. I live maybe about hour 1/2 from New Orleans and have family there, but I would go there along for a weekend. Maybe you should think about bringing someone with you.|`|uCSBFYIiaa	new orleans i not as bad as people make it out to be. i have lived here all my life. as long as you use common sense and don't walk around on dark streets past 12 midnight you should be okay. rule of thumb......if it doesn't look safe to you it is probably not|`|3kT2PN1qaa	number three for murder|`|mzeEo7wraa	bad... don't go alone|`|5JqzLjnAaa	its high. but you'll be fine. just make sure your hotel is in a safe area, and know where you're going.

The longest river in the USA is the Missouri River (it is a tributary of the Mississippi River and is 2,540 miles long), but the biggest in terms of water volume is the deeper Mississippi River. The longest undammed river in the contiguous USA is the Yellowstone River (it is 692 miles long). <br>  <br>  Rivers provide drinking water, irrigation water, transportation, electrical power, drainage, food, and recreation. Rivers also erode land and carry it downstream to the sea. This kind of erosion can even form canyons, like the Grand Canyon, and waterfalls, like Niagara Falls. <br>  |`|kjsVkB1Laa	The Colorado and Snake Rivers are great fun, but not really located next to large population centers, and most parts require a guide.

FNcvcCsoaa	If you have been in both South East Asia and South America you would see a lot more such evidence especially in their indigenous customs and habits (harvest dance, shamanism, incense-burning, headhunting) the objects they use and the food they eat.

They live in a similar environment, with similar raw materials and there are only so many ways of weaving a mat or a basket. The decorations are more intriguing indeed - but then have a look at Rungus beaded motives, and Ndebele (from Africa) beaded motives - they are virtually the same, yet it does not mean anything. It is like, 'oh, the Malaysians must be from the US, because they all wear jeans...' mitochondrial DNA is used to pinpoint the origin of people nowadays with much more precision than any other tool.|`|akNd7SMzaa	"chi cha chu"|`|zNyJVKAPaa	err, how do u do that? upside down - ?
NaT5dYU1aa	What is special to each region is how they prepare the same dishes.  For example, harira (the soup) is a little different in Casablanca than in Marrakech (where it is heavier).  The spices are a little different, too.  It may be fun to pick out one dish you like and have it in every city to experience the differences - i.e. some regions are a little heavy handed on the spices.  The national dishes of Morocco to try: Bistilla (chicken and almond pastry), Harira (soup), Couscous, Tagines (Beef, Lamb, or Chicken), Mechoui (roasted lamb), their pastries, and of course Atay Benina (mint tea).  I would stay away from the salads - they are great but since it's not cooked, your stomach may not agree with it.  And insist on bottled water that you open yourself (many places refill it with tap water).  I like Evian water but they have others.    I can't recommend a great place to eat in every city since I haven't been to all but I like to eat in Jmn Ifna in Marrakech.  It is outdoors, inspected daily by the government (Morocco is very protective of its tourists), and really yummy.  In Essouria, go to the docks.  They fish is straight from the ocean to the outdoor cafes.    I just weighed my tagines - 3 pounds for the small one (1-2 people), 9 pounds for the medium one (4-6 people) and 16 pounds for the large one (8-10 people).  We go to Morocco a least once a year and I have tried all methods of bringing tagines:  shipping (since I paid $3 US for the tagine, it seemed silly to pay > $75 to ship it - plus felt uncomfortable giving my credit card number to the agent (better off buying one on ebay here than shipping); packing it my suitcase:  broken, and lastly hand carried - perfect.  It seems like a huge pain to carry it, but it is the best way to ensure it arrives in one piece.  Make sure you understand from the seller what needs to be done to use it - some of them you have to put water in it, bake it on a low oven for a few hours, or it will crack.  Also, always low heat and it's best to put it on a gas flame or one of those ceramic hot plates.    One last thing:  the decorative tagines are usually not for cooking - only serving.  They weigh less but you wouldn't want to cook with them.  As a matter of fact, since you don't know if they used lead paint, you may not want to serve with it either.  Stick with the plain.  :)    Hope this helps!|`|NWv9hOFYaa	Top delicious Moroccan foods you absolutely need to have there:    Harira soup  Any kind of tagine, all great.  Couscous.  Mint tea.  Chicken with green olives and lemon.  Beef with prunes.  Moroccan salads.  Moroccan apps like olive medleys, preserved carrots, etc.  Kabobs.  Go to bakeries and you'll find teh best pastries, breads and croissants. Look for a nice bakery. The fancier it looks, the better stuff you get. But even the worst bakery has better cakes than here in the US!  Seffa ( kind of steamed pasta, with cinnamon, powdered sugar and almonds) very delicious.  You know what, sandiwches and paninis in Morocco are great and the best. even pizza hut there is better than here. try the seafood (fruits de mer) pizza.  if you go to Agadir, go to "le port" and get some fresh grilled seafood.    Enjooooy. I am hungry now :-(|`|Ud871v3paa	Tagine and cous cous|`|JWeGxTjZaa	You must try Argan oil - delicious when you just dip bread in it or use as a salad dressing.    Tagine is also very tasty and you'll eat it everywhere. My favourites were the vegetable ones but the chicken, lemon and olive ones were good too. They're not that heavy to carry but take it as hand luggage.    Enjoy - I loved it!|`|zlZDQz0Baa	I have not been to Morocco, but I am jealous! I have a few Moroccan cookbooks and make tagines often. Definitely have a lamb tagine, kefta, try things cooked with ras el hanout (spice mixture), preserved lemon, etc. As far as bringing home a tagine, it will be more cumbersome in size than weight, and it will be made from clay or terra cotta most likely so you'd have to be very careful not to chip or break it. Depending on how large it is it can get fairly heavy. If you are buying one there, I'd recommend buying a nicely decorated one, as the ones you can buy here are usually plain.  If you pack it very carefully, you should be okay. A good rule of thumb when traveling and planning on purchasing a lot - pack your suitcase and put it into a larger suitcase, that way on your way home you can use the larger one for purchases. :)|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Seafood is great on the coastal cities. Don't know if there is a single restaurant to recommend in any city, there are a variety. One food that is unique to Morocco is pastilla, it will surprise you. Couscous and tagines are great, but much better made and served in someone's homes. Msmen is a type of bread, and a dish called rfissa is also very different.  Tajines are heavy to carry, but thought it would be better to carry it and had to stow my carry-on in the hold on the last plane hold, the luggage handler dropped my carry-on on the ground and shattered the tagine. Don't know about shipping, tagines are fragile. They do sell metal ones but don't think they cook quite as good as the clay ones.|`|kmh6Slzfaa	If you do intend to buy a tajine to take home with you there is one important factor to consider when choosing.  Many of the tajines clayware has a varnish coating which can contain lead.   As we all know, lead can be seriously harmful to health so one must either buy an unglazed tajine or adopt the Morrocan philosophy of ignoring this danger as "you only live once" as suggested by some Moroccans.  I never thought so much consideration had to be given to the humble tajine.    As far as food goes - sadly in Moroccan tourist destinations like Marrakech, Tangier, Agadir and others, tajine is usually served modified to suit the tourit palate and you really have to go into the back streets, where Moroccan live and eat to find something authentic.  It's a bit like tourists going to Morocco and wanting to see the "real Morocco" as they call it, this doesn't exist in tourist places.    My suggestions for food are:  Starters:  Marinated olives and bread are served in all restaurants and there is no charge for these.  Byesar is a puree of dried broad beans.  Chick pea and parsley soup.  Veg soup with pumpkin.  Harira soup - probably the best soup on the planet.    Veg dishes:  Broad beans with herbs.  Courgettes with spices.  Spinach with beans, raisins and pine nuts.  Chick pea tajine.  Schlada, a type of gazpacho.   Date, orange and carrot salad.  Cous cous salad.    Desserts:  Serpent cake.  Pastries.  Rice pudding.  Stuffed apricots.  Kaab el Ghzal (Gazelles Horns)    These are mainly veggie recipes but with the addition of meat or fish can soon be adapted for carnivors.

They are simple, poor and uneducated, yet many of them struggle daily with honour to gain a living and to educate their children to snatch them away from the environment that they had to endure.

I went to go see The Sounds at La Zona Rosa and even though the place was packed, myself along with maybe ten other people were dancing. Same story for LadyTron. Maybe its true, white people cant dance? lol j/k or maybe Austinians are a pretentious bunch. i hear/see that alot

Obviously there are great dance clubs at both places.  There's lot's of gambling and great shows and food in Vegas, plus world-class shopping.  In Miami there's beaches and water if you like that sort of trip.    If you're looking for a more relaxing type vacation head to Miami...if you are looking for bright lights big city, always something to see or do then head to Vegas.  The weather is great in both locations at that time so you can't go wrong with that.    Good Luck!|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Do both.

There are really great weather there (:|`|41Jwz5Bbaa	Well this all depends on where you live.  But as someone who has spend many nights in both places Ill give some insight.  Vegas is just vegas.  If you party hard and want to just have a crazy time, it is vegas.  Its the city that never sleeps.  But to do Vegas right, you got to drop the cash so if price is an issue I would head South to Miami.  There are not the casino's to help further empty your pockets.  Fun in the sun at the beach is unbeatable.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	It used to be quite common for British people to go to Belgium, Germany or  France and buy a car for export that was shipped to their address in UK, so there is no reason why you should not do the same. Registration is carried out in the country where you live after the car has been delivered. You will also have to pay import duty. <br>  Perhaps the easiest way is for you to choose what sort of car you want and approach the manufacturers directly: they are used to people who have special specifications and ship all over the world.<br>  If you go to one of these countries yourself you can buy a car there and then and come back with it but the customs will stop you and require you to pay import duty on arrival. After that you have to register the car in your own country if you want to keep it on the road.  The shipping cost will also be quite substantial.

I have a friend in Ghana and that is what I did. Now that I know the amount of postage, I put them stamps on it at home. A first class stamp is equal to 42 cents so you can figure out how many stamps it will take.  My 4 ounce letter to Ghana cost 94 cents.  Hope this helps you.

If you want to do something "on the cheap" then don't be surprised if you end up like others who are unable to qualify for a job no matter what your cheap qualifications are.      Our prices are higher for international students because some Canadian tax money goes to help support universities and colleges.  If you are not a Canadian they why should you get the cheaper tuition rate.      Pick a good school, pay for the courses to get the credentials or call some diploma mill somewhere and get your certificate for $19.95 plus the cost of postage.
zqcR4YBvaa	If your primary mission is to learn Cantonese, then the best thing you can do is move to Guangdong or Hong Kong. Exposure and environment is the absolute best possible answer.    The second best thing to do is get a gf/bf who speaks the language natively. This can be done anywhere in the world, but it works best when used in conjunction with the first.    Formal classes work next best.    Finally, watching movies, reading magazines and listening to music should be used as a supplement to the first three.|`|LMQ9bgK4aa	actually i think chinese will be better , not cantonese !    the cantonese only are only mastered by few provinces in china , in other provinces , the cantonese will be useless!    so  here is a good site to learn chinese ( NOT   cantonese !)   http://lmandarin.com   hope you like it !|`|YBbumuyFaa	I don't think it's easy.|`|V9xCaV1raa	1. come and live in China.    2.

KzYlVTIwaa	My recommendation is not necessarily the best restaurant, but it's a great experience.    It's a restaurant in Sultanahmet (which has a lot of Istanbul's famous sites) called Doy Doy.  The main reason for going there is the the roof terrace- the view/ atmosphere is great.  On one side you'll see the Blue Mosque, and on the other you'll see the Marmara sea.  If you go at dusk and watch the sunset, and hear the ezan (call to prayer), you will really know you're in Istanbul.    The restaurant has 4 floors.  On the 3rd floor below the terrace is a chill out 'sofra' area.  After your meal, you can drink your cay (Turkish tea) there, and play some tavla (backgammon) or take a nargile (hookah pipe).    The meals are good, and very cheap.  From memory, I don't think they serve alcohol there.    Doy Doy is famous with backpackers, but you probably wouldn't find it if you didn't know where to look.  If you ask your hotel, they should be able to direct you.    Another good area to eat in is Istiklal Caddesi, which is the famous main street in Taksim.  There are lots of 'kebap salons' but also there are restaurants above shops too, such as Italian restaurants and some burger bars too.|`|G5BQbs3Gaa	Niyazi Bey in Uskudar  Any restaurants in kadikoy|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	McDonalds|`|AA10604976	For Turkish cuisine I suggest Hac?

xJBJn6dOaa	if you sublet for the month, then yes. Basically, this means that you would live in someone's apartment while they're gone for the month. I did this all summer. A girl I found through Craigslist was studying in Spain for the summer but needed someone to pay her rent still. She let her apartment to me for 900 a month (which is excellent here). Usually, rent is a lot more expensive.... a lot more. But, since you're basically helping the person out with rent, AND taking care of their place while they're gone, you can try to get a cheaper deal. Also, try Astoria (in Queens) or Williamsburg (in Brooklyn), which may be just a tad bit cheaper than Manhattan. Good luck!

puyAEPZyaa	I would definitely recommend that you book a room at Bellagio. Here is my run-down on Bellagio:    Location: Bellagio is located in the center of the Strip, so you can easily walk or take a taxi, bus, or the Las Vegas monorail to access everything else.    Atmosphere: Bellagio has a more upscale atmosphere, but is very inviting to all its guests. Bellagio carries more of an Italian theme throughout the resort, so tends to have a more romantic appeal to it.    Accommodations: Bellagio offers upscale rooms and suites that are elegantly appointed. The staff is very accommodating and the room service is above average. You can't beat a room overlooking the fountains in front of Bellagio.    Casino: Bellagio offers a variety of games and tables to suit anyone.    Dining: Bellagio offers fine dining, along with casual and contemporary dining. For fine dining, they offer Circo, Jasmine, Le Cirque, Michael Mina, Picasso, and Prime Steakhouse. For casual and contemporary dining, they offer Yellowtail Sushi Restaurant and Bar, Sensi, Olives, Fix, Noodles, the Buffet, and the Cafe. For dessert, they also offer Cafe Gelato, Palio, and Jean Philippe Patisserie.    Entertainment: Bellagio offers the one-of-a-kind Cirque du Soleil "O".    Nightlife: Bellagio offers the Fontana Bar, along with the Caramel Lounge and The Bank nightclub.    Other Amenities: Bellagio also offers a world class spa and salon, high-priced shopping in Via Bellagio and Via Fiore, and a beatiful pool area. Finally, Bellagio also features world-renowned fountains in the front of the resort, a beautiful botanical garden located inside the Conservatory, and an amazing Gallery of Fine Art.    Good luck and I hope you enjoy your trip to Las Vegas!|`|RfbpvqSWaa	You could try the new Encore.  It was just completed at the end of last year.

You definitely DON'T want to stay at the Circus Circus though if you're looking for a romantic getaway... there are too many kids there.|`|2PPQUFEwaa	no doubt, The Bellagio|`|NRa5MJ3Paa	Bellagio.  I loved that hotel! I almost cried when I checked out LOL|`|0Hb6Gd7jaa	If you have one shot at going top Vegas, stay at the Wynn.  There is no hotel in Vegas better.  Trust me.  You wont regret it.|`|urHPuzMsaa	The Bellagio would be your best choice. The Venetian is attracting a lower class clientel as they lower their prices so low that they are getting the Motel 6 guests. Heard this from housekeeping staff who have to clean up after they trash the rooms. Wynn is new and not established yet plus he is letting a lot of people go.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	As far as how luxury goes, the Venetian and Bellagio are very nice and classy.|`|MUcINsQ3aa	I stayed at the Luxor, and it was pretty nice. Im sure there are better ones like the Bellagio|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Bellagio, Wynn and Venitian are the nicest hotels are far as pure luxury.    If I were you, and money was not an object, I would get a fountain view room at the Bellagio.    No offense to the person above me, but Luxor is not even in the top 10 hotels in Vegas. If you are looking for a luxurious place, do not stay there.

IpQY6rVMaa	Priceline name your own price.|`|1OmSZUvLaa	You can also try going to a car rental booking site to compare rates from several companies.  When you find the cheapest company, you can also try going to their website directly.  Use a discount code, if you qualify.  There are hundreds of membership programs and professional associations that offer car rental discount codes to their members.  You can find a list of car rental discount codes for 8 major car rental companies, at http://www.best-car-rental-tips.com/disc...    It might also be cheaper for you to keep the car until Sunday, weekend rates are sometimes cheaper. Some car rental companies require a Saturday night overstay to get a weekend rate....  make sure to check both options.    Good Luck!
abughBHAaa	I, myself, have been looking for more live cafe music venues in NYC.  Many of them have died out over the years, thanks to Bloomberg's lack of rent control enforcement on small businesses.  There used to be many more, but these are the ones that are left and I recommend (most of their addresses can be found on citysearch.com):    In Manhattan:    Sidewalk Cafe  Lakeside Lounge  Banjo Jim's  Parkside Lounge  The Living Room    In Brooklyn:  Freddy's Backroom  Jalopy (next to Moonshine Bar)  Hank's Saloon (more like a bar)
MxMonsbVaa	see voddy strikes again,so its all starting to come out now.|`|hAxtd5yTaa	Move to the center of the state.  Storms and hurricanes are less of a problem.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Dd you know Fl has one of the highest unemployment rates and foreclosures in the country, I would not move here unless you have a lot of money or do not mind living a more modest lifestyle than the one you have in Michigan, and no the schools ALL suck unless you have enough for private.|`|wntdMR8caa	You will want to put your children into private schools. ALL of Florida's public school are lagging behind national, an even southern, averages. Tampa is pretty nice. I used to live in Clearwater and my mom lives in St.Pete. Make sure you buy a house with central A/C you will need it.|`|IyfspYM8aa	I lived in Tampa during middle school, so I know a few things about the area.  I lived around Dale Mabry and Bay to Bay Blvd and that was a great area.  I know that Plant High School is right there, so is Coleman Middle, and there's an elementary, but I'm not sure what it's called.  I went to Coleman for a while, but people were just too judgemental, so I ended up switching to a magnet school in a different neighborhood and I had to ride the bus two hours each way.  My sister went to Plant and she liked it.  It's a good school and they have a lot of sports.  She did soccer and crew (rowing) in particular.  They have football, baseball, things like that.    Depending on how much money you are making, you can live in South Tampa, which is also a great area.  I have friends in that part of the peninsula and I love going to there house because all the neighbors are nice and it's a very cozy community.|`|URO3gDXcaa	my condolences.  i made that mistake once and will never do it again.  west coast of florida is big on the drug trade and high crime.  traffic is horrible as there are not many major roadways.  both areas are pretty expensive for what you get.
IpQY6rVMaa	Cabo or Baja|`|sgW0Tf9Naa	I'm not sure where you live, but you can try Atlantic City, NJ. Its cold now so it may not be as enjoyable when its warmer. There's a nice beach there plenty of club parties, comedy shows, imax theater, boat rides, helicopter rides, mini amusement park and romantic hotel rooms. And its very inexpensive.  Its a gambling spot, but they have plenty of other things to do there other then that.
