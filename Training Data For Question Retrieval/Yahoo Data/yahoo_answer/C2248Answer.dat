Call Sony tell them your situation they will ask for your debit card number or credit card. but the going rate is 149 dollars i know it is pretty steep but you will have it back in a week roughly. i had the same problem soon after GTA 4 came out. i was down for 3 months because i had no money. but don't wait. Sony will send you a box and your card isn't charged until they ship it back my total was 158 and change because of shipping. and tax. yes they charge tax. but anyway hit up sony and it will be good as new when you get it back it will even smell new.   <br>  oh yeah and xbox BLOWS....lol|`|n0n7m6gYaa	take it to a game stroe like gamestop or eb games...theyll fix it and it wont cost a lot|`|mMcyU8wBaa	ditch the ps3? psshhht... ps3 is the **** since God of War 3.. hell ya ..<br>  just get your PS3 to gamestop and they should fix it or sometin if they don't then slap him.. hope i helped =]|`|jyVqvRxHaa	time to play wiiiiiiiiii|`|WklqoNqmaa	ouch no warranty that blows but maybe get a cd cleaner thingy at like office max or w/e

I used to play it for about 2 years myself. It's strange, because my friends little brother became really addicted too. Lvl 75 hunting in 2 months. Maybe it's the concept of playing with people, or because its complex to younger people, I'm not sure. Try to keep her away from it for about a week or two, or get her interested in some after school stuff or whatnot. Worst case scenario, she'll get to level 126 and suddenly realize that theres no point being where she is. Try to get her to really explain what shes trying to accomplish.|`|jtGkfT3haa	I dont think it should kill her life rofl. im a 14 year old male and I do play. But 10 hours a day is sick.

ttcCS2EMaa	Roman numerals and such are  really a third  edition set,at least- The wooden cubes  with plastic Boxes  was the first i think. What really dates a game  is the Board treatment- From the Sammy the Whale to the irregulated  coastal edge the image has  shifted  from play to combat. Castle Risk  changed  everything- After the modern character or  theme treatments it all became  relative.  I have  heard  of a varient called  Martian Risk- no doubt  someone  will do a 1890's Board and  Martian tripods  for that one.  Good luck on your  markers  I would  try used shops Yard Sales and such. j|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	You'll have to buy a used copy.

154dzJ1Faa	Ink is ink.  You can use it on anything that will accept it.<br>  <br>  With a screen, you have blocked out areas that don't get any ink and this is how you create all the designs and drawings on paper or fabric.  There is a separate screen made for each colour you are using.. these all have to be lined up perfectly, or registered, to get a good clear image.  Ink is usually very thick and needs to be squeegeed onto the print you are making.<br>  <br>  Without a screen, you have a wide open canvas, and can apply the ink anywhere and everywhere.  If you want to reproduce the design on 10 prints, or to make thousands of them, you need to make a stencil of some sort, and a screen is the easiest form to use.  Will your stencil stand up to several printings?  Then use it.|`|ucfR5uHwaa	you can do that<br>  but when you're done, take a sheet of wax paper<br>  <br>  carrrrefully put it over the painted design<br>  <br>  and use a baron (if you don't have a baron, try using a smooth, hard thing like a shampoo bottle or a smooth glass cup) and rub it over the wax paper to really print it into the fabric

SpqYjlVpaa	eBay will get you the most exposure of anyplace online. To get the most money for the cards, provide clear scans and detailed descriptions so that bidders know exactly what they are getting. If you do that, you should get fair market value for them. If you have cards that are not valuable individually, I recommend grouping them into lots by year and sport.<br>  <br>  To get an idea of what you can get for the cards, you can look at completed ebay auctions. I recently put together a web page describing how to do that: <a href="http://www.footballcardgallery.com/prices/" rel="nofollow">http://www.footballcardgallery.com/price...</a><br>  <br>  Another possibility is to post your cards on a hobby message board.  Some of these boards have forums where you can post your cards for sale for free. To find them, do a search for "sports card forum" or "sports cards message board." Collectors Universe is one example; here's a link to the Buy/Sell/Trade forum: <a href="http://forums.collectors.com/categories.cfm?catid=27&zb=2719463" rel="nofollow">http://forums.collectors.com/categories....</a>|`|rJPBF33taa	E-bay.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  You may want to hold onto them until they increase in value.|`|AA11185595	Never collected the but would advise a Google search and offer them to many , even take one and sell it on ebay to get an idea of price, very competitive market , don't tell anyone where you live and don't agree to meet anyone , keep it online and take payment through Pay pal
oJORZebKaa	Steady aim makes the cross hairs smaller for the weapon. The ptrs with steady aim is a bad idea the cross hairs are way too large. The only guns i'd do it with is the rifles the submachine guns and the ariska for no scoping because it's aimer is already small.|`|5frOVAgSaa	it is a really good perk if you are hip firing your gun as it reduces the recoil, meaning that more bullets will hit at the point where you are aiming. just don't use on single fire guns.|`|ouPDFQNlaa	It boosts your guns' accuracy when you shoot from your hips (when you see the crosshair). It basically decreases the overall spread of your crosshairs allowing you to fire more accurately at a target.<br>  <br>  Its an extremely good perk to use for a SMG - when you don't have time to aim and just in general. MP40 is a good gun to use it with.<br>  <br>  Alot of people think its a waste but honestly, it is very noticeable when CQC comes into play. For the PTRS its useless - unless you don't snipe and use it as a rambo gun =[].<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|zJZy2b7gaa	MP40 increases your blind fire accuracy (firing without zooming in). PTRS, possibly the same thing, but I doubt it would be noticable. Note that steady aim does not affect scoping or zooming in.|`|Med7VQI7aa	Well when you click the aim button it automatically stays still instead of moving around. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't really prefer that perk.

7WCsfeNeaa	They make it mandatory because it's a multiplayer game - you can't have someone with different skills/abilities even though they're the same class/race. Think about it - if patches weren't mandatory, everybody would patch to the version where their class was incredibly overpowered and just stay on that patch forever. Not only do patches add new content, they balance the game.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	If you're referring to the pre-WotLK patch, it was actually a great addition.  It enabled people who chose not to buy WotLK to have inscription as a profession; you couldn't do that with jewelcrafting when BC came out.<br>  <br>  I also agree with what the other poster said.  The game needs to be balanced, and if you let people play whatever they wanted, it would be a mess.  I'd be doing a quest that doesn't exist for you, you'd be bugged because you didn't get the patch ... it wouldn't work, and it would also negate the whole MMO thing.

EUaIGX0Gaa	1st battle:<br>  The two eels shouldn't be too much of a problem during this fight, and you can knock them out by hitting them enough. If you run out of MP in this battle, these guys are a good way to restore it. What you have to do in this fight to damage Ursula is hit her cauldron with spells. Just keep casting rapid Fira spells on her pot until it backfires and hits her. She will be stunned for a little while, so you should use every last second of this opportunity to beat the crap out of her. <br>  <br>  2nd battle:<br>  Argh. Yes, this is a really tough battle. Start by casting Aero on Sora. One of the worst attacks of Ursula's occurs when she opens her mouth very wide. Immediately start swimming away from her using the Mermaid Kick, because she's about to suck you in. She also shoots bubbles at you, which are easier to avoid the farther away you are. Also, she will zap you with energy beams every once in a while, but as you fight, you will begin to recognize what attack she's using. She uses the energy beams after she says, "Time to teach you some respect!" <br>  <br>  There is a certain way you can easily defeat her, if you manage to get stuck behind her head. This is hard, considering she tries to face you at all times. The best time to get behind her is right after she shoots the energy beam from her mouth and gets tired. She won't follow your movement as she stops to take a breath. If you do somehow manage to get behind her head, good job, you just made this boss fight bearable. Hit her as much as you can before you get unstuck, and you'll be a happy gamer. Don't worry if you don't win the first time, as this is one of the toughest regular bosses in the game.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	~If this is the first time you are battling Ursula with Flotsam & Jetsam, then the main weak point of Ursula is her cauldron in the middle of the room. Her magic gives her incredibly high defense, and she brings back to life Flotsam & Jetsam every time you defeat them (every time you defeat either Flotsam or Jetsam, you receive 60 EXP). So for this battle you should definately put a lot of Ethers in your Item Slot.<br>  <br>  The recommended Keyblade for this battle is the SPELLBINDER key chain because this weapon is very good in using magic. To receive this Keyblade, you must have learned every level 1 magic spell and talked to Merlin so he can give it to you.<br>  <br>  Lock on to the cauldron and attack it with magic. This causes the cauldron to backfire and give damage to Ursula. When this happens, Ursula is unconscious and it is also your chance to damage her physically with combos from the Keyblade. When she regains consciousness swim away from her fast and redo the whole process again until the battle is over.<br>  <br>  Just try to swim close to the ground around the cauldron to use magic spells. Using Fira is a good way to strike the cauldron from a far distance. Also, try not to use the Cure spell so you won't use up your MP so much. If your health is low, use Items or let Donald use Cure on you.<br>  <br>  For winning this battle with Ursula, you obtain the Shared Ability MERMAID KICK and you also receive 1,000 EXP.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~If this is the second time you are battling Ursula when she is a lot larger than usual, then still use the Spellbinder Keyblade because you will have to use magic to eventually attack her from a far distance. Also, equip the new Mermaid Kick Shared Ability to help you out.<br>  <br>  Once the battle begins cast Aero on Sora and cast it each time the spell wears off. With Aero, you can reduce damage and counterattack Ursula.<br>  <br>  Use Mermaid Kick to get close to Ursula's face. It's best to stay near the back of her head and attack from behind as much as possible. But the bad part is that Ursula will constantly turn to face Sora, so it won't be easy. When she starts to gasp for air, swim behind her head. Release combo attacks to the side of her face or the back of her head, and swim away when things are about to get dangerous.<br>  <br>  If you get caught infront of Ursula and she begins to inhale water, use Mermaid Kick to swim away until she can't inhale anymore. If you don't you will suffer a massive amount of damage.<br>  <br>  When she announces her attacks, this signals you to either fight or swim away. You can avoid the bubble attack by using the Mermaid Kick or by staying behind her head. Whenever she raises the Trident, this means that she is about to spread a circle of damaging magic around her. Swim away as fast as possible and don't get caught in the blast.<br>  <br>  You can use normal magic spells to inflict some damage on Ursula, but watch your MP meter carefully and always leave 2 MP to cast Aero. If you're having problems with losing a lot of health and being defeated, place Megalixirs in everyone's Item Slot before attempting to battle her again. For winning this fight, you receive 900 EXP.<br>  <br>  After officially defeating Ursula, you seal the key hole to Atlantica. You also obtain ANSEM'S REPORT 3 and the new CRABCLAW key chain. And your Thunder magic is upgraded to THUNDARA.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	1st battle:<br>  The two eels shouldn't be too much of a problem during this fight, and you can knock them out by hitting them enough.

She'll get stunned, the you attack. Repeat until you defeat her.<br>  <br>  Part II(When She's all gigantic):<br>  <br>  Skip it.<br>  <br>  I'm not joking. What I did was skip this fight and went on to the next world. To tell you the truth, I had problems on this part. I completed all of the worlds except for this one. When I was like Level 30 or 35, I went back there. Then, the next thing you know, you already overpowered Ursula. I was like killing her in an instant with the Metal Chocobo Keyblade. I am seriously NOT joking. I did that and I was on my way to Hollow Bastion. <br>  <br>  I hoped that helped you. :>

Qojzmwhqaa	I have been to both, and I had a lot more for at Kings Island. It really depends on your personality though.|`|popRBGHUaa	As far as I am concerned, they are two of the top three parks in the northeast, with Six Flags Great Adventure in NJ being the third one.  My top pick would be Cedar Point, since it's the roller coaster capital of the world, but I am going to both parks in May.  Woohoo!|`|104ce958076abbafb22d9376838c2af1aa	Ooo...that is a tough decision!<br>  If you're into rollercoasters, Cedar Point is the place to go.  It is America's "roller coast" after all!  If you're into wooden coasters, steel coasters, etc., they have it at Cedar Point!  <br>  Kings Island gives you more of an overall experience and doesn't focus just on coasters.  For example, you can go to the water park (at Cedar Point, you have to pay extra to get into the water park, Soak City) or maybe sing karaoke at a night show (like I did...lol).  All the rides are good, and there are still coasters there too.|`|D81hhlKSaa	No doubt Cedar Point, but you have to pay attention to what time of the year and what day you go because it can get crazy packed! I live about 5 minutes from Cedar Point and the summers get so ridiculous because so many people come from all over the world. On a typical July weekend as many as 60,000 people could go to Cedar Point. So if possible go in either May or September and if not try to go on weekday. And get there early. Eat before you go because it's expensive! But it's definitely worth the experience, some of the greatest rides in the world.|`|fnLhqbDpaa	Like someone else said if you like roller coasters cedar point is definitely better. I have been to both and ..well since i love roller coasters I  had way more fun at cedar point ..to me there is just no comparison.|`|gJnXb9NIaa	I have been to both serveral times and I think that it depends on if you are taking small kids with you or not. When taking the kids I prefer Kings Island because the wait time for rides seem to be shorter and they have a wide variety for the kids to do. As far as going without the kids, I say hit the Point because the coasters are tops! I'm sure you will have fun at both parks though!

IxNQwrKYaa	Many (if not all) versions of Operation do not have an "off" switch, because it is not needed. The only time the battery is being used up is when the tweezers come into contact with the edges of the openings that contain the body parts, which causes the buzzer to go off and the nose to light up. As long as the tweezers aren't making contact with the edges of the openings, no battery power is being used. When you pack the game, be sure you put something around the tweezers that prevents them from making contact, or cover the board. - LJS|`|Vv7a31pmaa	bottom/

AA10232254	There are no doubt MANY of them, with a lot not being exclusive to Halo 2. I will list as many as i know, and answer to the best of my ability which is the best in terms of membership, overall skill of members, and fame/skill levels of some particular members.<br>  <br>  KSI** - This clan can be summed up in one hyphenated word: has-beens. All of the good players have come and gone, and the ones that are left are too busy thinking highly of themselves to realize basic human dignity and the fact that they don't know what they are doing. <br>  <br>  MoB* - To be honest, i don't know too much about this clan, though i do know some. Their members seem to vary greatly in overall skill and fame. Most of the ones i have played with don't have much skill at all, but i know personally a few members who are QUITE good. My guess is that this is one of the biggest clans, with the most difference between its top players and its lower ones.<br>  <br>  XGC* - The one thing i will say about this clan: it is STRUCTURED. The ranking system is very detailed, with Privates all the way up to 5-Star Generals, with their symbol broadcasting their rank loud and clear. This would have to be one of the biggest clans (about 30-40 subdivisions of the clan). A few downsides, though. Because of its size, it is ripe for corruption. There are many cheaters that are enlisted, because it is such a large body, it is difficult to locate them. Another thing is, if you are in the clan, you HAVE to have a set icon, and i'm not sure if you ever get to have your own symbol. <br>  <br>  CoW* - This is a decent clan. Again, i know a few people in this clan, they are good players. I don't know anything about it, however.<br>  <br>  QsK* - In my opinion, this is the best clan. Walshy is a member, and i know a lot of people in it. They are nice people, generally, and good players, and decently organized.<br>  <br>  <br>  * = sponsored<br>  **=lost their sponsorships|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	its your oppinion|`|545790cab9de168243c4435268855ac0aa	I would go on bungie.net to find that kind of information out.|`|AA11058119	That guy above me who wrote out the long post doesn't know what he's talking about...<br>  <br>  I believe he's referring to CAL league clans, which are some decent clans.<br>  <br>  However, all of the good Halo 2 players play in the MLG tournaments ( <a href="http://www.mlgpro.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlgpro.com</a> )<br>  <br>  The best clan (only beat in a tournament once), is Final Boss. Their 4-man team consists of:<br>  <br>  Ogre 1<br>  Ogre 2<br>  Walshy (Hotshy)<br>  Saiyan

cjaphGaoaa	Skating is actually easier than you think. <br>  <br>  I'm a girl and learned in about 2 or 3 practices that each lasted like 15 minutes. <br>  <br>  Just be sure to practice a lot around your neighborhood. Be sure to not be afraid, cuz that was the main thing that was holding me back from learning. Once you master turns and stuff go to the skatepark and do some easy ramps.<br>  <br>  A complete, nice board would cost around $90. That would be a reallyyy nice one. I would recommend you pick a cheap board up at walmart and see how you like skating first. I spray painted mine and it looks wicked. If you are going to spray paint it to hide the walmart-ness just be sure not to spray the grip tape. These boards just cost $10-15.
Yx0AddHzaa	Yes try any HM/TM can be learned. I used it and already have a Pikachu that knows surf. Unfortunately I don't have the code on me right now so you will have to look it up. try neoseeker
nwhtWduqaa	My advice, do some research. If he/she is is using a Steel/Ice team, counter the team with some anti-moves: such as using Fighting-type moves and Ice-type moves.<br>  <br>  Steel-type aren't good against moves that are type Ice and Bug. So that means don't have your Pokemon be infested with ice moves, because Ice on Ice will do only half the normal damage. Using Bug moves would be hard, but if you want to know a good one, I recommend Heracross. Of course there are other Bug-type Pokemon you can use.<br>  <br>  Ice-type aren't good against Grass, Ground, Flying, and Dragon-type moves. There are a variety of Pokemon to choose from. Having a Pokemon being specialized in two different type sets have their advantages and disadvantages. So in this case, make them something like Grass + Bug, or Dragon + Flying. Many Dragon Pokemon have the capability of learning Steel-type moves such as Steel Wing (TM 47.) My recommendation of Pokemon would be...really any Dragon type. Even Garchomp since it's Dragon + Ground!<br>  <br>  So you team should consist of three Dragon + Flying type Pokemon and three Fighting + (something). Your Fighting-type team should consist of probably something like Blaziken, Heracross, and Lucario. (Warning on Lucario. Though he is a Fighting + Steel, his Steel-type makes Fire and Fighting moves Super Effective!) Your Flying Team should be Salamence, Dragonite, and Rayquaza/Articuno/Lugia/Ho-Oh. (But if you don't want to use Legendaries, then let it be either Pidgeot/Staraptor/Gliscor. [Warning on Gliscor. It may be a Flying-type Pokemon, but knows none at all, even through using a Heart Scale. It can only learn Wing Attack through breeding.])<br>  <br>  I hope this helped! I can't wait for Pokemon Platinum to come out!|`|qa23RzPnaa	make a team that covers your weakness'<br>  <br>  example.  you have a charizard out, hes flying and fire so hes weak to water and rock<br>  <br>  get a normal pokemon and teach it water and thunder moves.  ect. <br>  <br>  you want to mix up your attacks for charizard too (dont just give him fire spells) give him fire, flying (incase you fight a fighting class) and ect, cover your weakness'
9rLOiqx6aa	I would wait until your level 70 to work on yews. I'd power cut willows in rimmington then sell them in the general store until 70 since its faster xp. Then when 70 cut yews for money|`|AJ1vAIBvaa	At your woodcutting level it seems like you would be cutting around 300-600 yew logs per every 4 hours, and thus your income would be around 150k-200k per day, HEY its not much but its seomthing i cut yews till 60-99!<br>  <br>  ~Dragon Axe has 15% Cut Increase, so invest in one if your wanting 99 wc.|`|NNarkOIvaa	I personally did woodcutting from 60-97, *currently 97 and still cutting*  working on it. :) the cash gain is worth it, in my opinion, but EXTREMELY slow, so..you can take your choice between speed and no cash, or being slow, and actually making something. :) goodluck.|`|VHSUCJy8aa	no, cutting yews at the lowest possible levels is VERY slow. you won't make much money at all and you will bore to tears. Your time is better spent doing something else.. My suggestion: cut willows or maples and get your level higher with those 8 hours. At level 75 or so cut yews. The same goes for magic trees once you get the level - don't start on them until you are a good 10 levels higher than needed.
i4a6uN6Paa	Yes the wii is fun but there are mostly rated E games and not much of the vilent games that most people want.

Those games are amazing party games but as a wii owner, i love the wii, and i wouldnt trade it in for a ps3 nor an xbox360, the wii is revolutionary ;) and dont forget cheap lol|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	uh are you crazy?...just keep the PS3 then save up to buy a Wii...<br>  <br>  Try buying multiplayer games like SF4, COD 4 & 5, Little Big Planet, Resistance, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Come on "Killzone 2" is an awesome PS3 exclusive.....|`|2eCxJp6Paa	quite the question. i believe you should,if you would like more multiplayer. i'd say more but id rather be careful than yelled at.|`|a3MxfZ0daa	[blank] no!!! dont do it. the wii is fun and all but after about a week it gets boring stick with the better graphics|`|1K8NPRUOaa	I'd keep the ps3 since there are more better games for that system.
1f24219bd45c40c06d32ba4a60a7c4a0aa	Supposedly, the two are nearly identical.  The PS3 has a faster processor, but the 360 has much more memory.  at least that is what the developer's say.  Me personally, I don'y see much difference between the two.  it all depends on which franchises that you want.  For me personally, I want the PS3 and the Wii because  I already own the 360.  Zelda still wins no matter what.|`|92b363630b38c2c89af3ef73467abfe6aa	ps3 because the graphic is better than xbox 360<br>  and it's new|`|AA10270246	the 360 man the ps3 os to much money and they will not even have enough ps3's on the market until 2008 oh and the graphics are not better there the same the online play kicks the **** out of the ps3 online its going to be as bad as the ps2 online|`|a3738b9a599463d452106c8bd5da3ea2aa	I say go for the PS3.

The Sony line however has had a few problems, but they've been great about fixing the problems quickly & improving their products along the way. Also, on the PS3 you'll be able to play all 3 deck games (ie: PSOne & PS2) which I think is pretty cool.|`|39dc2c350d4f77ecef2e691c1d980db7aa	Definetely PS3

UIyyPNWPaa	Devil May Cry 4 all the way! And my 2nd choice would be Resident Evil 5. Only reason I believe this "other than being an obsessed fan of devil may cry lol" is that this game, and Resident Evil 5 have both fantastic stories, and fantastic effects and great voice actors.<br>  <br>  These two are the choices to go with, if you want to play a long fun game. Street fighter.... you basically end up just doing the same thing after a while. DMC 4 and RE 5 you have so many places to explore, and characters to meet, and you get an interesting story to go with it.|`|kb2q03jvaa	get resident evil 5 then wait a little but for little big planet next. have fun shooting zombies!!!! do not waste money on devil may cry 4 let me tell u now it is not worth the money. if u must get it, but it used on line for 20 bucks or under do not pay over for that game. street fighter 4? do the same as devil may cry.|`|XkkY2Lw0aa	If I were you, I would get Killzone 2 and COD4. But if you really want to pick between those choices, I would have to say Resident Evil 5 and Street Fighter 4.|`|J1mNUHVdaa	Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4, they are both action packed games. But, resident evil 5 is kinda scary JUST kinda...and they have great storylines so i insist to recommend it for you, but  those are just my opinions. you're the one who's gonna buy so you have to judge for yourself =)|`|m0xehTLqaa	resident evil 5! no doubt about it. and little big planet is quite entertaining|`|B0W3OLqqaa	Little Big planet<br>  It's lots of fun : )|`|sN9CEa5Taa	Little Big Planet for choice number one and maybe Resident Evil 5 but it really depends on what kind of games you like. If you like scarier games then get Resident Evil 5 or Devil May Cry 4. If you like less scary games then get Street Fighter 4. But, for choice one, get Little Big Planet. It is probably the best of these games and will last as long as people continue to make new stages.|`|EbXfVfmJaa	Littlebig planet and Fallout 3. I know fallout wasnt on the list but its just too good. avoid resident evil 5 because in my opinion, it sucks. its way to slow and it handles like a garbage truck.|`|a267e563a86842d53dabc50747f245e1aa	little big planet.. residnet evil 5 suks dude trust me little big planet is too awesome..|`|HWMbapTlaa	RESIDENT EVIL 5 Definitely....and Little Big Planet

4vG9ys8paa	They could have a pokemon contest, where there are multiple challenges that they are graded on. Each person controls some pokemon throughout the contest, then they are graded on a scale of 1-10 in different categories (like shininess, jumping skills, talent contest, maybe even battling, etc.) and their scores for each challenge are added up and the person with the highest total score wins! Yay!!!<br>  <br>  You could have some of them live in a castle or swamp or some other play-set you have and the other ones could invade them and try to take over. Maybe one person could control the invading force and one person could control the defenders? You could also have the two teams centered around a theme, i.e. fire-type and water-type or dragons vs. fish. Great fun to be had for all.<br>  <br>  Or you could have them all work for a king, who sends them on missions throughout the house, such as raiding the sock drawer or opening and closing the fridge 3,000 times. Eventually the king turns out to be evil though and the team of pokemon have to go on the run, eventually staging a war against the evil empire, composed of all the other action figures you own. Also fun.<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN WITH YOUR POKEMON ACTION FIGURES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|MTr4dy3naa	Play PKMN Mystery Dungeon: going in journeys to help lots of PKMN.|`|ikcFKlhSaa	Two things come to mind.<br>  <br>  One would be a War type game where you assign certain pokemon ratings, abilities and whatnot, and take over each others land. This would be perfect if you had a lot of each or each different type. Then, you and your brothers take a minute or so each turn and set them up on a battlefield against eachother. You could also buy a whole bunch of the TCG cards to incorporate into a game. Like, if each energy card was +1 attack power for a troop, +2 if they match, and whatever else you can think of. I do remember walking into a store once and they had a whole bunch of energies for like, 15 cents each. It would help on so many different levels<br>  <br>  The other, would be to make a stopmotion video with your brothers and you all act out the voices. It might not sound like too much fun,  but trust me. You have plenty of fun laughing while making scripts and brainstorming, and when you're done filming, you can sit back and watch your masterpiece. <br>  <br>  <br>  Or you could do what my older brother and sister did with me when I was fun.

oQSzZeubaa	Hello!  From looking at the Fender site, plus several on-line guitar parts sources, there does not appear to be a distinction between the Starcaster and Stratocaster pickguards.  In fact, viewing pictures of each, the contours appear identical.  I would only caution that whenever you go from one product line to another, there will be minor incompatibilities.  Most likely, the 11 mounting screw locations will not be in perfect alignment, requiring some plugging and repositioning one or more holes.  Not a big deal, readily-available wood putty is easy to use and works great!  Best regards, Dana|`|LGgS4O8paa	Is it a Fender Stratocaster with a whammy bar?|`|bjty5HfWaa	i think so

W4KOJlGoaa	It is a Spanish coin. It is worth about $450 in good condition. Best answer me = )<br>  The words on the front mean four petal rose|`|g4QIJ2xHaa	In 1732 the Spanish mint at Mexico City began producing coins by striking blanks in a press, with a collar. These ''milled'' eight reales coins, gained acceptance throughout the Americas, since they were of regular size and weight, unlike the crudely struck ''cobs'' that had preceded them. They were popularly known as ''Pillar Dollars'' (from the design) or ''Pieces of Eight'' (from the practice of cutting them in pieces to make change), most often in quarters (two reales), from which we get the expression ''two bits.''<br>  <br>      For the American colonists, the Spanish coins were a convenient method of exchange, since England had left them to their own devices. Often, contracts specified Spanish Milled Dollars for payment, and Maryland even used the word ''dollar,'' and showed two Spanish milled dollars on its 1770 two-dollar paper currency.<br>  <br>      Later, the Continental Congress in 1775 approved bills of credit for defense amounting to two million Spanish milled dollars. And in 1776, Thomas Jefferson recommended that the United States adopt the ''Pillar Pieces of Eight'' as its monetary standard, since business was transacted in those coins. In 1777, Robert Morris, the Superintendent of Finance in the Continental Congress, wrote: ''The various coins which have circulated in America have undergone different changes in their value, so that there is hardly any which can be considered as a general standard, unless it be Spanish dollars.''<br>  <br>      It would be another twenty years before the United States had its own mint, and even then, the Spanish coins, often clipped or worn, circulated freely, while United States coins, of higher intrinsic value, were hoarded, or shipped to Europe.<br>  <br>      This kept the Spanish ''dollars'' in circulation for decades, and Congress was forced to extend their legal tender status until 1857-60, when the U.S. Treasury redeemed them at a discount for the new small cents that were issued to replace the old large copper cents and half cents, which were also being removed from circulation.<br>  <br>  <br>  SPAIN, Mexico City, 8 Reales, 1741, 26.5 grams|`|154dzJ1Faa	bigmeany is partly correct.  Coins were once permitted to be cut into eight pieces to make change.  That is why many of them were called "pieces of eight", and why the parrots that a pirate always had on his shoulder kept crying out for "pieces of eight".  When you had it cut into a quarter, or two pieces, it was called "two bits". When we started using dollars, and had the 25-cent piece (a quarter of a dollar), it was also called "two bits".<br>  <br>  Many people used to shave off just a little off the edges of a coin to melt down into a piece of silver for themselves.  The coins became smaller and smaller as people used them, and the value of the gold or silver content went down.  To prevent this, coin-makers started to put a milled edge on coins, which would clearly show if someone tried to scrape off a little bit of silver for themselves.  Most coins still have that today even though there is almost no precious metal in coins at all.|`|VCwTM7sGaa	the date 1760 is old and its from ur grandpa then id wouldnt sell it id treasure it. its like u giving ur treasure u save ur whole life and then give it to ur kids and they sell it how would u feel? i wouldnt feel so well  so keep it.

eNHGiEvGaa	It's not okay, and if you are caught you will be disqualified.  Any money you win will be distributed to the other players in the tourney.  You will risk forfeiture of all money in your poker accounts, and permanent banning from the site which hosts the tourney.<br>  <br>  I don't know all of the details of how sites spot collusion, but keep in mind that they have information on your IP address, and the entire chain of IPs through which your data is routed.  They can review (after the fact) all of the hands you played, with full knowledge of the hole cards of each player.  They have tools to watch for suspicious patterns between two or more players, including chip dumping by checking or folding the nuts or a strong hand to protect a partner.  They can observe when a player aggressively pushes reraises with garbage hands, only when their partner has strong hands and they are "whipsawing" a player in the middle.  They can find when your play seems to be based on knowledge of cards in another player's hands.<br>  <br>  Some collusion attempts are spotted automatically.  More often they are found because other players raise a complaint, and the site managers do a review.<br>  <br>  Some people probably do manage to get away with collusion, but the sites are making it tougher all the time.  The more money that's at stake, the more likely you are to get caught.  Note that even the winner of the biggest online poker prize to date, TheV0id, had a prize of over $1 million taken away from him for violating terms of service, by playing more than one account in the same tourney.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	its hard to prove your cheating online, in the real world youll be disqualified and sent home with nothing|`|y822j5h5aa	What you are planning is called collusion and is in violation of the terms of service for every online poker room on the internet. <br>  <br>  If you are caught, your account will be closed, your deposit forfeited, and you will be banned from the site, and any sister sites. <br>  <br>  All sites have some sort of monitoring program to attempt to detect cheating. And other players may detect your partnership and report you, this is how most cheats are caught. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to an article about it: <a href="http://www.thedoverpro.com/pokercheat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedoverpro.com/pokercheat.ht...</a>|`|EfskbKpEaa	This is very bad to collude in online poker.

If it's a well-known site and has been around for a long time, you can feel confident that it's on the level.<br>  <br>  However, with any type of on-line gambling, you can never be certain. You're looking at computer images of a roulette wheel,  cards, dice, slot machine, or what have you. Any and all of them can be manipulated by someone. You have absolutely no way of knowing.<br>  <br>  Real casinos don't cheat because they don't have to. They wouldn't risk getting shut down to gain a few dollars here and there. Plus, at a real casino you're playing with real cards, a real dealer, a real roulette wheel and ball. It would be very difficult to rig any of them without getting caught.|`|y822j5h5aa	Many online casinos are simply scams. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to a blacklist of online casinos with the reasons they are on the list.

I thought it was an unfair system detection or a not "so random" number generation.<br>  Then I started a research on how online casinos worked and wich casinos are "on the square". I found a site called Casinoculars.com that keeps an eye on online casinos based on online users experience.<br>  On the other hand I′ve found a smart variation of the Martingale that takes advantage of some casinos that have a big gap between table limits. Unfortunately that site is in spanish, so if you want me to explain it to you just contact me and I′ll explain that method (I don′t want to post it here not to distort your question).|`|irFvDZmNaa	If you want the truth! EVERY BIG BUSINESS cheats and rips off their customers, whether it is Walmart, United Airlines, or Casinos. <br>  <br>  As for Walmart, there is a DVD you can watch that is devoted to bring the scams of Walmart to the general public.<br>  <br>  As for Casinos, YES! Casinos cheat! Online, and at the live casinos. If you do not believe me, just think about why we have Gaming Commisions which is regulated by the federal government? Casinos have been known to cheat customers. Casinos still have many new ways of cheating customers that do not violated regulations established by the Gaming Commissions. Therefore, casinos are making millions alone just from cheating. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd be very careful about how much money you spend online or at the live casino. Unless you have an extremely unbeatable system, then you should not spend any cash whatsoever. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are a serious gambler, then you would be betting with a great strategy. This requires a strategy that has been tested with software that allows you to perform at least 10,000 through 100,000 trials. If you've done this, and your results show that your strategy is a winning strategy, then there is no reason why it shouldn't win online. If you have tested your strategy, and are still losing, then you are definitely being cheated. <br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind, there are many professional gamblers who have extremely great strategies. However, they still lose when playing online because they are being cheated. So please be careful!|`|u2slnVCoaa	Where do you play ?<br>  Every self respecting online casino is fair.

70dc770ce52605ed62b4bb85b498d563aa	PS3 is supposed to be able to do more but also costs a lot more.  So if you are going on what system is technologically better I'd have to say the PS3, but as for price and the ability to get one now, the 360 is tops.  I guess the real way to find out is to wait till Nov. when the PS3 arrives and check them both out in the store.  See which one you prefer.  I think it's basically more of a prefrence type question. (which controller is more comfortable for you, what are you using it for? [games, music, movies...etc])|`|10a13da7e2109c133a123267bd1d3a07aa	u should ask that when the PS3 is out that way i can tell u accurately<br>  <br>  but i do have to say that the 360 does have better games and with surround sound the shooters will sound so sweet compared to playing gay Final Fantasy(Final Fantasy what a waste of a game!!)|`|ecdf26c0784c5023430bbb09ec2f33c8aa	The question is pretty irrelevant at this point, as the PS3 is not available yet. As for audio/visual quality, the PS3 should be at least as capable as the 360 at producing high-quality visuals and sound. It certainly should look no worse than the 360. (Personally, I would expect them to be more or less on par with each other, but we'll have to wait until we see some actual PS3 games in action.)<br>  <br>  But the concept of "better" ultimately depends on what games you want to play, not on the technical superiority of one console over another.<br>  <br>  *Edit* New games for the PS3 should cost about the same as games for 360 (between $50 and $60 US).|`|AA10299769	Both of those systems have problems.<br>  <br>  The Xbox 360 supports online and has great graphics, but it overheats after 1 hour of playing.<br>  <br>  The Ps3 however, has alot of problems, the console is expensive ($600 USD), the controllers feature no rumble feature whatsoever, and the games are expensive. People say that it will be the next DreamCast, if you know what i mean!|`|AA11416397	The Playstation 3, if all of it's facts are true it will be extremely slightly better.  But, for $600 for the console and $89 a game, it is ridiculous.  The differences between the 2 are slim to none so I am getting a XBOX 360.|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	well the ps3 is no out yet, so it would be impossible to say|`|bc1d944c9a52589c0e64fa14d528d370aa	PS3 defiantly just look at the specs|`|1d2487c3067719fd2b68e6acd80f2754aa	The PS3 has a better processor, albeit different, a significantly more powerful video chip (30% higher clock speed), and a larger hard drive.  It will also allow you to play high definition movies on blu-ray discs when they finally start to hit main market.  The online service that Sony is going to provide will be free for the general multiplayer matchmaking, etc.  Sony has stated that the majority of titles will be retailing for $60 at launch, which isn't terribly surprising.  Additionally, the ps3 is supposedly going to be running a version of linux that will allow you to run custom applications.<br>  <br>  In all reality, $600 for the ps3 is cheap for what it does.  I think internal blu-ray writers alone are supposed to retail for $700 at the start.  The console itself will be able to do most of the things a regular pc can do, especially if the linux part is correct (you could write word processing aps, drivers, etc.) without any modifications to the hardware itself.<br>  <br>  To be honest though, I'm more concerned with whether they get enough good games on the console.  A console isn't crap without the right developers or a selection of games.  One just has to look at the gamecube to realize that a console is only as good as its games (gamecube had the poorest sales of the three).  While the ps3 has better hardware and more potential overall, the games are what will have me buying it, if I do, since I already have a computer that can do the rest of what that console can.  It'd just be nice to have it all in one concise package. :-p|`|86aee7a52b1faa577d4dd49dc3480551aa	Ps #3|`|AA10864558	The 360 for sure but it also depends on your taste in games. If you love hardcore games with top class graphics go ahead if your willing to cough up 600 bucks for the system and the rumored $ 75 games go for it. If you love good grade graphics and a little cheaper go for the 360. Plus Halo 3 is coming this spring so I'd go for the 360.

Then  click on the MUSIC folder or PHOTOS  folder(depends on what you are uploading and they should already be made).  Then if you already have pictures or music ready, just transfer the files into those folders.

And when white people play tennis it doesn't  require much skills at all. Plus  your just hitting a little ball back and forth with people going, "uuhh, huu, yee, waa, nee." While black people play basketball which is more eciting and require lots of skill. You can dribble, dunk, lay up, yell, start fights, and so oon. <br>  But dont get me wrong, if you put a black man on the tennis court, you  know he will dominate.

AEkpzmA8aa	If I were you, I'd rent the first GRAW and get through the single player campaign.  Its awesome and shouldn't take too long.  Give the online part a try too.  Then get GRAW 2 when it releases.  The demo is awesome.. they loosened up the controls and added so many more cool elements to the game.. but I'm sure you've played that demo already.

4bf61ccab2edbc0122f70662746b22ccaa	Picking locks is all about timing and rhythm. A tip though, when you try to pick, notice how fast the latch moves up. The slower it moves up the slower it comes down. If it goes up quick, try again...eventually you'll get a slow one..then pick it!<br>  <br>  Yep, pick up everything you can get your hands on....if it's not yours to take, you get a different icon on it...leave those alone.<br>  <br>  DISCLAIMER: my experiences are on the PC version.

9Jrvncusaa	I don't like the one for the ds because of the new boost thing you can do whenever you drift. It's supposed to be for whenever you turn a corner, but people online use it for straightways, and pretty much for the whole race. It ruins the online experience.|`|AA11783029	its a ok game but u can beat it in like 1 hour
BsKuknojaa	I think that is just a mock-up of Shibuya Terminal which appears in the intro movie but is not actually reflected in the game<br>  <br>  in my version (JSRF/Sega GT 2002 combo disc) some of the stairway rails are purple but that big central section with the statuary is not in the game either, which leads me to think it's just for show

I got really addicted the game when I was younger - slaying monster after monster - meeting new people - leveling up with freinds in the same group. <br>  <br>  You can talk to computer players to get new quests to go on - collect stuff - buy / sell stuff to make gold to buy better things!<br>  <br>  Really fun and worth the download in my opinion.

When you're done, you can roll them back onto the bolt as they are, or separate the two halves and then roll them onto the bolt, one after the other. <br>  <br>  If there is no crease or if it is uneven, use quilter's rulers and a rotary cutter to get an even cut. You can form a sideways "T" with your rulers to get it exact. <br>  <br>  .|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	there will be nothing neat about it, that much fabric is a real job to deal with.|`|40lpbZmaaa	Is the fabric folded in half? If so you can open it and cut on the crease. You would need another empty bolt to roll up what you cut. If you don't have another bolt, you could try hanging it on a very long clothes line outside? Wash the line so it doesn't get  dirty. Fold it as you cut it if you don't think it will work. Find someone to help you. <br>  I made 10 foot high french pleated curtains for a 12 foot span window so I know what your dealing with!<br>  good luck

tAg1EZKSaa	The same cable that you need to connect many digital camaras, Motorola Razr phone, etc. It's an usb cable with one of the ends smaller so it fits in you psp. If you have windows 2000, XP, etc you can just plug it in and it will recognize it <br>  BUT ONLY AFTER YOU ENABLE USB FROM THE PSP.<br>  Your PSP has menus right? the first set of menus to the left is where PSP CONNECTION is. Press "X" after or before connecting the cable to the computer. "O" before you disconnect. The PSP will show as a new drive inside your computer. You will see a folder for music and one for pictures, that's it.|`|15431299b515d8ac8a3d21f6df6d7afeaa	Too easy, man. The usb cord you need has a regular shaped type on one end and a small shape (see the top of your PSP for the shape) on the other. On your PSP, in the main menu, go to USB connect and it'll say USB Mode. Connect your PSP to your PC and it should automatically self install so you can view your PSP. Sometimes it may say External Mass Storage or PSP. Good luck as well cuz some PCs won't even recognize the device whereas you may have to try again or it'll say "...The device may not work properly". If it occurs and no PSP has shown up, try it again. My luck is that I would reset my PC and reconnect the PSP again so it'll be like starting over. Hope it works for you, man!

i4sIXIlLaa	El vidrio soplado es una técnica implementada por los artistas del vidrio.<br>  <br>  Existen dos tipos de vidrio soplado.<br>  <br>  El vidrio soplado pyrex <br>  El vidrio soplado reciclado <br>  Ambos son artesanales, y requieren una gran destreza y ocupan de la mayor concentración posible, dado la temperatura del vidrio, y de la fragilidad del vidrio.<br>  <br>  <br>  [editar] Vidrio Pyrex<br>  Esta técnica empleada en todo el mundo, para realizar por ejemplo artesanía como: Pipas, aretes, pulseras, collares, bisutería. Pero también existen otras especialidades para el soplado de vidrio, como el científico, especializados en la realización de aparatos de laboratorio, el soplado de vidrio para tubos de neón en los rótulos,... Esta técnica artesanal emplea herramientas como soplete de gas butano o propano y oxigeno, tenazas, pinzas, gomas de soplado, tornos, máquinas de corte y los hornos para el templado del vidrio. Los colores de los vidrios se obtienen de cristal pirex coloreados previamente (de fabrica). Para poder hacer una artesanía con esta técnica, se necesita de que el soplete funda el cristal pyrex, hasta llegar a unos 2000 grados centígrados con los que se pueda moldear libremente. Ya con la idea determinada. Todo esto carecerá de un buen trabajo, si no se tiene una experiencia previa, sobre el manejo de los colores y de su fundición, ya que a muy poca temperatura el vidrio no podrá trabajarse con facilidad y además tiene un enfriamiento muy rápido. La combinación de colores yb formas vendrá de la creatividad del artista, al untarlos, fundirlos, mezclarlos, o adherirlos al cristal con el cual se va a trabajar. Para poder darle formas con volumen interior, muchas veces utilizan de una pajilla metálica que al perforarla en el cristal, sacan aire de sus pulmones, calibrando el aire según el diámetro de la burbuja o la forma que quieran hacer. Cuando la pieza es muy grande suplen los pulmones con la ayuda de un compresor. Para tener una mejor visualización sobre lo que se trabaja en esta artesanía. Pueden recordar de los agitadores con figuras en vidrio, el cristal de Murano (en cualquiera de sus modalidades).<br>  <br>  <br>  [editar] Vidrio soplado reciclado<br>  Su primer uso, que se remonta a tiempos muy antiguos, era para objetos de bisutería. A?adiéndole diversos minerales durante el fundido se obtenían cuentas de diferentes colores. En la Antigua Roma se inventó el soplado, técnica que permitió la elaboración de recipientes e, incluso, de láminas para ventanas.<br>  <br>  Para poder fundir el vidrio, se necesita de una temperatura de 1600 grados centígrados (C°), todo esto para que tome de un comportamiento viscoso y cristalino, con el cual se podrá trabajar con facilidad. Muy liquido seria imposible de trabajar al igual que muy denso. Se vierten cargas de vidrio soplado en un horno (conformado con ladrillo refractarios, uniéndolos con una mezcla de mortero y agua [como capa interior], como para exterior se emplea ladrillo de barro, todo esto con la finalidad de resistir las altas temperaturas y mantener el calor), después de vertidas las cargas se iniciara el "derretido" del vidrio. Para poder tomar el vidrio se utiliza una "ca?a" (tubo cilíndrico de acero hueco) previamente calentada de su parte lejana al cuerpo humano, para poder estar a la misma temperatura del vidrio y esta no sume un choque termal, y no dificulte su adhesión a la cana. Se introducirá en la "tina" (deposito de vidrio derretido) del horno, una vez introducida la cana se le dará vueltas al tubo (sobre su propio eje), para poder obtener la mayor cantidad de vidrio (según la pieza a fabricar). Una vez tomada la masa de cristal de le procederá a darle una forma esférica sobre una placa de acero, para poder manejarla mejor (todo esto girando la masa sobre lo ancho o largo de la placa). Una vez teniendo la forma deseada, se pasara a soplar (con la boca introducida en un extremo de la cana, soplado) la bola para poder darle la dimensión deseada (según la pieza a fabricar). Después se pasara a un molde (de acero en grano), y se procederá a soplar con muchas fuerzas dentro de la pieza (adentro del molde), para poder darle una forma predeterminada (en producciones mayores como vasos, copas, jarras, floreros, etc. es necesario de un molde para agilizar la producción), una vez teniendo una forma "predeterminada", se mocha de un extremo con un simple golpe en la cana, dejando caer la pieza sobre un contedor (previamente acondicionado con tela de asbesto en su parte inferior y arena sílice de un grano demasiado grueso), todo esto con la finalidad de que la parte donde se unía el tubo con la pieza de vidrio soplado sirva como boca de alguna pieza (solo en vasos, copas, floreros, ensaladeras, licoreras, botellas). Una vez que se deposita, con otro tubo (para acabar), previamente calentado a la temperatura del vidrio (en el contenedor a 900 grados centígrados (C°), se tomara de la parte donde no esta la abertura, y se introducirá al horno (por una de sus bocas), para poder calentar la pieza para poder trabajarla. Una vez teniendo la temperatura deseada, se abre poco a poco el orificios con unas tenazas (de hierro forjado artesanalmente), para darle un diámetro superior al inicial. Después de obtenido el diámetro calculado, se utiliza un madero cubierto de papel periódico (previamente humedecido con agua), y se le da la forma a la boca, según se desee. Después de terminada la pieza, colocándole las aplicaciones que se deseen, se pasara a un horno de temple, para poder disminuir la temperatura poco a poco, y este agarre características especiales (según el método del templado) como dureza, tenacidad.|`|ywsSq8CWaa	depende de que tipo de cristal:<br>  -Mexicano<br>  -El fiorè veneciano<br>  -Soplado alemàn, etc etc etc<br>  en un horno de fundiciòn a miles de grados centìgrados, se incorporan cualquier tipo de vidrio dependiendo el color que quieras soplar, (botellas principalmente) ya que el vidrio està fundido, con una "trompetilla" se adhiere esa fundiciòn y conforme le vas dando vueltas a la "trompetilla" vas soplando hasta formar cualquier tipo de utensilio. salù

Just get  a strong wobbufet and keep throwing ultra ball or timer balls when you have played for a long time, could try quick first turns. Get a fast pokemon with false swipe to attack it and keep doing that until it is 1 hp. False swipe allows you to attack until it would die but it will one hp.
FK9sbbaraa	it dosnt take 'time' it takes 'steps' it usually takes no more then 1,000 steps to get the egg,you can also use the poketch app from the glasses guy that is in the daycare. it could also be that the evee is to low a level to breed yet.|`|bgxiy5wMaa	For breeding a pokemon, it normally takes no longer than a week.

hsvYoZ1daa	Go to Lake Verity inside the cave on the island, you'll find Mesprit, one of the three Legendary Pokemon of the game<br>  (similar to the Legendary Birds, Entei/Raikou/Suicune, and the Regis from the previous games). Speak to it, and instead of entering a battle, you'll be shown a picture of Mesprit (which will be added to your Pokedex and counted<br>  as "seen") and it will then flee from you.<br>  <br>  Rowan will then enter the cave, tell you a bunch of stuff, and then tell you that you can track Mesprit's position by using the Marking Map Application on your Poketch (the one with the symbols). On the map, you'll be able to determine Mesprit's position by the blinking face on the map. In order to encounter it, you'll need to be at the same location its at and will need to encounter it inside of tall grass. Be warned, though: it will run immediately unless you use an attack like Mean Look! Any damage you do or status conditions you inflict will remain on it for your next encounter if it flees.|`|ce56afe013a7ca4da8d85a61550535d1aa	Mespirit, the guardian of emotions right? Go back to Lake Verity, (you know, the one where you first get your pokemon) and surf down the lake into the cave<br>  The rest of the guardians you catch by going back to the caverns at their respected lakes. (Lake Verity, Lake Valor, Lake Acuity)

When there's a pillar that tells you numbers, whenever a 3 is first, no matter what door you pick, Giritina will be in it.<br>  <br>  If you mess up going through the cave, then it will take you back to the beginning (I think; memory's a bit hazy on that.)|`|e606580b6e3127887ab8d7cef6814d20aa	after you beat the Elite 4 you will unlock spring path which will give you a chance at catching giratina carry alot of dusk balls and ultra balls he is lvl 70|`|wD1yT68Baa	after you beat the Elite 4 you will unlock spring path which will give you a chance at catching giratina carry alot of dusk balls and ultra balls he is lvl 70

d9cb7c2b387864dafc58aae3bb0251d8aa	Right now I would have to say rainbow six vegas.  Personally, I think rainbow six vegas is better than gears of war.  I love how you rappel and go through windows like if your a commando, i think this game is more challenging than gears of war ( ppl say gears of war was hard.  I didn't think it was that hard, only when it is set on insane its a little hard. ), and the multiplayer in this game i think is way better than gears of war.  Ever since rainbow six came out, I'm still playing it on xbox live.  I got bored of gears of war on xbox live really fast.  After three days I got bored of it.  Also, the weapons in rainbow six vegas are well balanced.  You don't see someone win because they had a good weapon, they won because they have skillz.  You might have a better weapon than your enemy, but you still have to know how to use it.  One shot in the head with any weapon will kill your opponent, so you have to be accurate.  In gears of war, noobs depend on chainsaws and boom shots.  Anybody could get a lot of kills with those weapons.<br>  <br>   Overall I think rainbow six vegas is the best game for the xbox 360 right now.   <br>  <br>  Gears of war is actually my third best game for the xbox 360.  My second best is oblivion.  Boy that game was awesome too.|`|AA11230556	NFL Madden 07
27468791169dc4e1c14a88e6e4f8d134aa	The game took me two days to finish, but that was two long days. The game contains 11 missions, and they took me about 1 hour to complete each. Thats not counting the times that I died. Visually, it is stunning. I played it on my SDTV and while at times some of the fine print was hard to read, they were only subtitiles. Objects are easily seen at great distances, I only wish the magnification on the scope went that far. The weapons range from your standard machine gun to shotgun, rocket launcher, rifle, energy gun, and plasma gun. I like the plasma gun, hard hitting and has a good zoom on it. Unfortunatly its not as fun as the chainsaw gun in Gears of War. But GoW doesnt have Vital Suits. These are approx 9 ft tall machines that can do a variety of things, some transform, some fly. As far as your enemies go, I found them to be lacking in the AI department. Fighting the Akrid was very good, they behave like insects, swarming you, biting at you, being bad little buggers. And each one has a diferent tactic to defeat, as well as a unique weak spot, market with a yellow area that turns red as you shoot it, with T-Eng spilling out. The humans on the other hand, lack what I would consider a believable AI. I've had them come around me from behind and stand infront of me, as if to say "here I am, shoot me!" <br>  <br>  At the end of it all, If you want a good shooter, this is a good shooter. If you havent played GoW yet, I'd say get that one first, unless you want to walk around in machines and shoot bugs. This is a good game when you get tired of GoW turning your character into ground meat and the 4on4 mulitplayer gets old. Then again, using a chainsaw to cut your enemy in half with all the blood and gore that goes along with it never gets old.|`|8a06cd761cabd5eb071d4e70e9a6b2a0aa	Yes it is cool.But if you are looking for a violent game then get Gears of War.

Also, it was rated 6th hardest game in one site.
HUARwUmFaa	I assume you mean to level up your character. If that's the case, new characters should do Tristrum runs until about level 12, then try to get rushed through the rest of the acts. From there, do Baal runs until you're about level 45, then repeat on Nightmare difficulty until about level 75, then repeat on Hell until level 99. That is, if you are playing online.<br>  <br>  If you're flying solo...I suggest to just dungeon crawl and explore everything. Once you get to the Throne of Destruction, kill Baal and then repeat the Throne scene until at the desired level.<br>  <br>  If you want a SoJ, you'll most likely have to trade for one. If you're playing single player you can just download a Hero Editor and make one yourself. Likewise for open battle.net. However, if you're on the closed circut, you may be a bit out of luck. SoJ's are highly sought after for their mana% boosts (a whooping 25%!). And seeing how the more popular builds require lots of mana, such as hammeridins, cold sorcs, and the recent reveal of how easy it is for a summonancer to solo Uber Tristum, the demand for SoJ's are very high. Most likely you'll need two high runes.<br>  <br>  However, if you're using a Melee build, such a Smiter, Martial arts assassian, or any Barbarian build, I would try for a Bul-Kathos' Wedding Band. It offers life leach, +1 to skills, and is cheaper (probably only one HR).

6ffdd8426449bf55ede185c776d59d2caa	When installing expansion packs for The Sims 2, you use the disk for the expansion pack that you installed last.  It doesn't matter what order they're installed in.<br>  <br>  It sounds as if you guys borrowed each other's disks. To make it so you don't have to keep using each other's disks, you will either need to buy the expansion packs yourself, or, unstall the game and then reinstall, making sure to install the expansion pack you own last. That way you will be able to play both expansions, but only have to use your own disk.
c1c80148a2eaebcbf034c55261e6e729aa	It may be possible to download an illegal bittorrent to get the missing CD, but it will be extremely difficult if you're not a computer whiz... and even if you do find the right file, it may be cracked or altered and not work with your original legal CDs...<br>  <br>  The best bet is to contact EA customer support and maybe they'll allow you to submit proof of ownership and send the lost CD.  <br>  <br>  It's possible a kind person will send you a copy of the CD, but maybe it's copy protected and won't work.  It's worth a try if you know someone who has the game and can copy a CD-ROM.<br>  <br>  Lastly, maybe you can buy the game from ebay and get the CD that way.<br>  <br>  Those are the only options I can think of.

QV5Mkidpaa	First you need to go to the museum in slateport. <br>  It costs $50 to get in. Pay it, you have no choice.<br>  <br>  If you talk to the grunt who's closest to the entrance, he will recognize you.<br>  Who is this guy? He's the goon "you thumped before, remember?" In an effort to<br>  gain your forgiveness, he will fork over TM46, Thief. Then he takes off.<br>  <br>  Go upstairs, save, and talk to the guy. Sweet, we meet Capt. Stern at last. But<br>  wait! Two Team Aqua Grunts come upstairs and demand the Devon Goods!

As if on cue, Archie, leader of Team Aqua, will come<br>  upstairs, talk some smack, then vanish. Then, at long last, you will deliver<br>  the Devon Goods. Free healing!<br>  <br>  You can leave at anytime, so go - oh, what? It's that guy in sunglasses, the<br>  guy that dissed you earlier! Time to show this guy what for.<br>  <br>  Er... no, apparently not. He introduces himself as Scott, and you will register<br>  him in your PokeNav. He wants to look at the talents of other Trainers, so he<br>  takes off. Pfft. At least he didn't diss you this time.<br>  <br>  If you didn't go to the Battle Tent before coming to the Oceanic Museum, Scott<br>  will come out of the Battle Tent if you try to go in and urge you to take the<br>  challenge. Even if you don't want to, go inside and talk to the sailor. He,<br>  like, will give you TM41, Torment.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Okay. You're finished with Slateport City. Did you get a Harbor Mail?

Im guessing the PS3 is mostly gonna be black but Ive heard something about white ones being available in the US. But for the other colors It's gonna be hard to find them in the US because most of the time they are only available in Japan. You could probably find a different colored PS3 online on ebay or other websites that sell them but they are probably going to cost more than the regular one. Also there is probably gonna be a period of time before they are available in different colors I dont think they will be available right after the launch.

However if your last update is higher then 1.50 you either need to downgrade it (hard to play your UMD games you need another program for this).  Be careful though...some of these files will corrupt your PSP and cause it to "brick." This would make your PSP impossible to play and void the warrenty.<br>  <br>  I have read about it...and have just given up having to keep the updates...just not worth ruining my beautiful PSP.|`|d45eeb5f2bda25b2d50f1d7045f4fd74aa	It's more complex than you might think.  Please let me know what firmware version you currently have on your PSP, as that is key to determining what you need to do.  If it is 1.50 or 1.00, you're all set and you just need to download the emulator.  If it's 2.00-2.80, check out www.noobz.eu for a program called "eLoader" which will let you use homebrews on those firmwares.  For any firmware above that, you can't do anything yet.  If you need more details, I'll explain once you say your firmware version.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you'll need an emulator.  You can get an NES emulator for Super Mario Bros. here: <a href="http://dl.qj.net/e%5Bmulator%5D-v0.82f-for-the-PSP-Nintendo-NES-PSP-Emulators/pg/12/fid/11343/catid/127" rel="nofollow">http://dl.qj.net/e%5Bmulator%5D-v0.82f-f...</a><br>  <br>  It's not the best NES emulator, but it also emulates other systems including Game Boy and Game Boy Color, which I'm sure has Pac-Man if NES does not.  I can't give you links to the roms themselves because they're illegal.  You can reply (I think) or email me at unknownwarrior33@aol.com if you have more questions.

600dc06384532cba78cf1ab615c511f2aa	Elebits is a good one that just came out.  It’s a revolutionary game of hide and seek as players search high and low for Elebits, mischievous little creatures that are the source of the world’s power. Use the unique functionality of the innovative Wii controller to push, pull, lift and throw anything in the environment as you attempt to track down these playful little creatures. As you capture Elebits, players will be able to further interact with the environment, using them to provide power to different implements that will help them in their search.  So much fun.  Trauma Center is also good.

01dc8aa299c8ecee20a804889cb61578aa	Very nice 56 range... I do have a pure ranger with range level over 40 and a pure mage as well. I will add you. I have a runite miner and I can pay well for the services of any or all of your clan/crew in finding rune ores that are available when I am trying to mine runite in 46 wild. It takes quite a while for rune ores to respawn so I end up hopping to a lot of different worlds and when I do that I run into a lot of pkers or I waste a lot of time logging out and into another world when there is no ore there. So to help me get more rune ores faster, I pay people to hop to different worlds and when they find ores, message me and then I'll hop to the world you are in (and you can guard me while I mine too or distract other miners by attacking them if you want) all while getting paid well. You can still do all your normal pking while getting paid to protect a runite miner. I smith some runite stuff too so I make very good $. Email me with your username either through yahoo answers or directly at masters_of_the_obvious@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  High level smithing is obviously the best way to make the most gold pieces fastest and I want to be able to get a smithing skill cape quickly and will pay well to those who help me...

As the game plays fast having longer quarters would allow you to rack up points etc.  I could understand with online stat sharing and stuff why they might have taken that option out.

Get a larger one, a 1gb will hold like 250 songs, and there cheap. Check ebay.For videos download PSP video 9. For pics you go in the E:/PSP directory and make a file called PHOTO. Then drag pics in there|`|gIuPVaIgaa	u probably have a small memory card. To download videos go to google video and download one(make sure u select the psp download option . then plug in your psp. A psp folder should come up. Drag the video into the video folder. Do the same with pictures. Hope this works

Many comp. shops have that game
yEFMrNQdaa	Grand theft auto San Andreas hands down has to be the best GTA game because of all the things you can do. You can get lost doing random crap like drivebys|`|74d60f8a261011c866d1622e35ac34f4aa	San Andreas of course, you could eat fastfoods, have clothes, nice cars and much better than Vice City.|`|979e6a1abfdc9b20b49c770a9f65082daa	GTA: IV|`|928cdc07bd4b87b7c1eea0720cbbe4c7aa	Vice City|`|Dvjk97SHaa	obviously the newest: GTA san andreas. <br>  But whats interesting is the psp one...w/e its called.<br>  Anyways, try not to use cheats, 'cause its more fun...lol

QV5Mkidpaa	I am a big Pokemon fan and i was able to help many people on this same question in my past. The reason why is that Visual Boy Advance is an emulator and it emulates a game boy advance but it can not copy everything. Sometimes the battery runs dry in the visual boy advance because it does not copy everything from the actual game boy advance so it wont be able to work perfectly. Emulators work well but they do not copy everything. My Pokemon Emerald in the Visual Boy Advance gets messed up right after i beat the Pokemon League, emulators cannot copy everything. Just try downloading the latest version of Visual Boy Advance. It is here in this site. <a href="http://vba.ngemu.com/" rel="nofollow">http://vba.ngemu.com/</a><br>  This should help. If you have any other emulator or pokemon question, you can always email me and i will be happy to help you.|`|f63b14fb8ba8cf91548c020dbe0d00feaa	Ummm...ok.  Only one Pokemon of mine evolved, but that's because he's a lifeline.  I didn't know that Pokemon evolved at night.  Oddish are a night species (I think).  You can find them hiding in a tiny patch of grass beyond Slateport.  Be Forewarned:  that route's literally crawling with powerful trainers.  The Oddish are usually around level 13, or so the one that I managed to catch is.  Hope this helps!|`|80db1eba37a760a2acfc5cab76967bd1aa	make sure you got the latest version, and look for options for real time clock.

0185GdB7aa	mmm you could just keep killing good or bad guys to get the points and also get stats to spend on your spells etc. and Ronok the axe is in the demon door in the Grey house near Barrow fields, but if you like Fable for PC so much I'd highly recommend Diablo 2 and Diablo 2 LoD both hundreds times better than fable, although Fable is a pretty fun game but a bit kiddy though|`|jpUh8ERHaa	Well, I really don't know what all you have or haven't done but there are things to do even after a win or marrying the "lady".<br>  <br>  Why not do a google search on a walkthrough and check out what else there is to do and see if you want to continue?<br>  <br>  Or you could move on to other games. By the way, I am always looking to swap games with people so drop me an email if you are interested.<br>  <br>  Postage is cheaper than buying new games and it is good recycling too!

71d8e04bcf25c5f16da4320909a76f12aa	First off which version.  He's kinda simple in 3, but in 5 he's a ***** because the game changes to accomodate your highest characters level.  <br>  <br>  My brother and I have beaten him on hard in three and four only with maxed out characters and 5th level weapons.  I can honestly say we've never beaten him one on one in hard.   Normal and easy we've beaten him tons of times.  <br>  <br>  My advice if you can't have someone play with you so you can double team him,  is to wait for the brothers to get down there and have them help you kill him.  They actually stand a chance against him unlike other generals.

mJJGVkAoaa	We don't know that for sure. If yahoo says it's him then it should be. Just think what could happen if the real Shigeru will force yahoo to ban the user who uses his name. Not to mention the justified right of using a VIP's name without any authorization would lead yahoo or the so called faker to court!<br>  <br>  Assume It's Mr. Shigeru alright.|`|b56143858fb834dcc65d4bc75833e863aa	No, it's just some stupid kid playing a trick to get popularity. They've got no life. Shigeru Miyamoto is probably way too busy to be on the Internet. He's most likely working on a new game console or video game.

f4c02f363e4e2b7f618597bea33617b6aa	Depends on the game you're playing.  It had a general meaning, but has some slight differences.  Overall, it's a group of people that do things together and help each other out to advance in a game.  Some guilds are small, some humongous.  The guild i am in has over 300 members.  Some other games don't have a guild officially implanted into their system.  SOme games revolve around having a guild.  Basically it's a faction of people with sometimes a leader and officers.|`|bN7KOlJhaa	a group|`|HFBcviwzaa	Guild Wars?|`|f63b14fb8ba8cf91548c020dbe0d00feaa	A guild, such as the guild in Neopets, is a group that involves people supporting something they love.

f63b14fb8ba8cf91548c020dbe0d00feaa	Sorry my friend.  I didn't know shiny Scyther existed.  You could look up that on the official game book (you won't believe all the facts on rare Pokemon you can find in there.)  I'll keep looking.  Wait, if you have a shiny scyther on Pokemon FireRed or LeafGreen, you can migrate him.
rY23uewCaa	keep using the focus button... and work on stringing your combos. it's a pretty boring fight, but if you do that you'll beat him. oh yeah do a lot of jumping around and fighting the lizzard men to build your power meter so your attacks do more damage
kDmz3JTfaa	Even though I don't condone botting or cheating...here's a link to a website with Ragnarok Online bots|`|AA12331455	mpcforum.com/archive/index.php/f-51-p-12...|`|fb3nReX3aa	Nowhere.<br>  <br>  Reasons:<br>  <br>  1. It's very likely you'll get caught (especially on private servers)<br>  2. At least 90% of bots have trojans or keyloggers on them, some of which can't be detected with the majority of virus software. If you don't want to lose things such as your RO account, or your banking information, or any of the stuff like that, just play the game properly without any botting software. Besides, the game is nowhere near as fun if you get a bot to do it all for you.

mZbwzxjMaa	hmm.... your best bet would be to install a custom firmware<br>  but here is the tricky part, if you've got a psp that is higher than the version 3.03, then you can't install a custom firmware since you need to downgrade to be able to install that.<br>  <br>  ISO is an image file that is a copy of the UMD<br>  but ISO's are illegal if you don't own the game<br>  <br>  check <a href="http://www.psp-hacks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.psp-hacks.com</a> they've got all you need. and other homebrews beside the one you are talking about|`|lfPXQfFvaa	try goin to psp homebrew websites and email the people for tips. thats what I did. :)
tAg1EZKSaa	3.03 oe-c is too old now. It won't allow you to play some of the new games, such as Pirates 3, Shrek 3, Transformers, etc. Get 3.4 oe-a here: <a href="http://www.zshare.net/download/custom-firmware-3-40-oe-a-installer-rar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zshare.net/download/custom-fi...</a><br>  Just unrar the file and replace the game folder in your psp with this one. Then you run the update from your PSP.<br>  However, you will need to have 1.5 before you upgrade to the custom software.<br>  This is what you do to get to v1.5<br>  If you have Firmware 3.10 or higher: <br>  Update to 3.5<br>  Downgrade to 1.5<br>  You need the original game called Lumines to do this.<br>  Install custome software<br>  --------------------------------------<br>  If you have Firmware 3.03: <br>  Downgrade from 3.03 to 1.50 <br>  You will need the orinal game GTA Liberty cities v2.0 or Lumines Game<br>  Install Custom Firmware<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  If you have Firmware 2.81, 2.82, 3.00, 3.01 or 3.02: <br>  Update your Firmware to 3.03 <br>  Downgrade from 3.03 to 1.50 <br>  You will need the orinal game GTA Liberty cities v2.0 or Lumines Game<br>  Install Custom Firmware<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  If you have Firmware 2.80: <br>  Downgrade from 2.80 to 1.50 <br>  Install Custom Firmware<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  If you have Firmware 2.71: <br>  Downgrade from 2.71 to 1.50 <br>  Install Custom Firmware<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  If you have Firmware 2.01, 2.50, 2.60 or 2.70: <br>  Update your Firmware to 2.71 <br>  Downgrade from 2.71 to 1.50 <br>  Install Custom Firmware<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  If you have Firmware 1.51 or 1.52: <br>  Update your Firmware to 2.00 <br>  Downgrade from 2.00 to 1.50 <br>  Install Custom Firmware<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  If you have Firmware 1.50: <br>  Install Custom Firmware<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  If you have Firmware 1.00: <br>  Update your Firmware to 1.50 <br>  Install Custom Firmware<br>  Check my other answers for download links for downgrade files or post a request here because custome software DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FILES NEEDED TO DOWNGRADE TO 1.5|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Yes.  It does.  However, in order to run it,  your PSP firmware must be 1.50 first.  If not, you have to downgrade it.
AA10398402	most probably it's worth it more to send it back to the seller,<br>  <br>  but before you do that, try this: Take off the faceplate of the xbox 360 and check if the MICROSOFT WARRANTY STICKER is still on there. If it isn't, then send it back to the seller right away.<br>  <br>  If the sticker is on there, call Microsoft and give them your serial number to find out when it was manufactured. If the xbox is less than a year old, they will repair it for free, no matter where you got it from.<br>  <br>  If it IS  more than a year old, it will cost $140 to get it fixed, warranty sticker or not. If it is more than a year old (which is usually the case on ebay xboxes), then send it back to the seller<br>  <br>  i'd def. do the seller, you're lucky enough the seller is offering to exchange it, most sellers just say no|`|OpEtgwR1aa	The best thing to do first would be to call Microsoft and ask them how much it will cost to have it repaired. If the seller exchanges it, you may be getting a worse system than you have now. My suggestion is to just call Microsoft and ask them.
ab0d6e6281ea22e51e0ef97dffe87cf6aa	you type it in the code option in the game.|`|ZWzcCXroaa	You put in the serial number provided.
433f425738f140c0c54af698e6bf7749aa	warmage|`|fa6dccc789a82bc2e1697c9463cb3e63aa	For pure offense, I'd say warmage (from Complete Arcane).  Buy Cha and Int items to get the highest number of spells, best save DC's and maximize your warmage's edge ability.  Although you didn't mention defense, a warmage can wear light armor, a set of mithril chain may be a worthwhile investment.  At that level, you can't afford a good Ring of Wizardry yet, so you'll need to hold off on that.  As far as feats go, Spell Penetration is almost a must, Spell Focus: Evocation is a strong choice for any offensive caster, as a warmage, it will affect almost all of your offensive spells.<br>  Race won't matter much as long as you have no Int or Cha penalties (there are very, very few Half-Orc warmages) and if you can get a bonus to those, well and good.   High elves (sun elves) get an Int bonus, past that I think your looking for either something 3rd party or taking a level adjustment.  Pity.
AA12159734	You know, I am having the exact same problem. I came to your question when searching for a similar terms.<br>  <br>  It's very nice that you have a beach near you. The nearest one from me is at least two hours away. Make use of that. Have fun in the ocean, just riding up and down the waves while talking with your friends. Go boggie-boarding or surfing. Throw a frisbee around or play a game of volleyball. Make a sandcastle, even. There are plenty of things to do there.<br>  <br>  If your town has a community center, try checking out some activities they have planned there. You may find some of them fun, and possibly meet new people with your interests, whether they are in art or music.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to do alone is reading. I know, it may sound boring, but there are a lot of good books out there! If you can pick up a really good book, you can have a lot of fun. I personally like books when you can actually relate to the character. Try picking up a novel about a teen. Sometimes they may even have books based on your favorite television shows. I just found a book series for 24.<br>  <br>  Even volunteering can be fun. Go to a local hospital and find out if they have any opportunities for you. Work at a horse ranch if you like animals. You will have fun and feel good about yourself. This is really good for college as well. You can meet people who you work along side.<br>  <br>  Now that your 16, why not even consider getting a job this summer? You can earn some spare money to use when you want something fun to do with your friends.<br>  <br>  I wish you a great summer! I hope these suggestions have helped!|`|JCG2rBSBaa	go on holiday ? or join a club ? or go to a playscheme ? or chill out and have sleepovers wid your friends ? or go to a camp ?|`|4591fc9a48f541402f2a2bc7b4cc2fd4aa	concerts are always fun|`|mc7OVCWtaa	try chatting on AIM or going onto these websites: www.habbohotel.com, www.clubpenguin.com.

Dusk balls surely work well.|`|zYHtbXf7aa	I had six Pokemon ridiculously stronger than it, so I took my time and caught it with a Timer Ball. And why would you use Earthquake? It's a Fire/Steel Pokemon...Ground would do 4x the amount of damage. Other than that downside, I use Heatran as one of my main team.<br>  --------------------------------<br>  <br>  <br>  Heatran<br>  +-+-+-+<br>  Fire/Steal<br>  +-+-+-+<br>  Flash Fire<br>  +-+-+-+<br>  Scary Face<br>  Lava Plume<br>  Fire Spin<br>  Iron Head<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are interested in catching Heatran, I assume that you have already beaten the Elite 4, acquired the National Pokedex, and traveled to the Battle Zone. Bring a Pokemon with Strength, Rock Smash, and Rock Climb and buy an Escape Rope or two.<br>  <br>  You'll need to go Stark Mountain. The most hassle free way to get there is to start from the Resort Area. Travel North on Route 229, through 228 the desert-ish area to Route 226/227 where you'll continue to go north.<br>  <br>  After some Trainers and aggravated wild Pokemon, you'll reach Stark Mountain. You'll see your rival and Buck, the Red Haired trainer that welcomed you to the Battle Zone. He'll run ahead. Follow him and you two will partner up. Make your way through the cave, once your reach the end Buck will find the Magma Stone and run off with it. This means you have to go and find him.<br>  <br>  Leave the cave and make it to the Survival Area, west of Stark Mountain. Buck will be in his house just to the left of the Pokemon Center. Talk to him, and he'll run out again to try and replace the Magma Stone.<br>  <br>  Return to Stark Mountain. If you don't want to fight any Pokemon, bring a Super Repel. Use it at the entrance of the Mountain and use Rock Climb to get back to the place where the Magma Stone was found. Save before you enter, though. Because You'll be fighting a Lv.70 Heatran with a decent move set. One that isn't caught easily. I suggest fighting at night and bringing a couple Lv. 60 or higher water Pokemon. A few surfs and its heath will be low. Good Luck.|`|Nq6xlKOjaa	truthfully i had forgoten to buy enough ultra and dusk balls but i caught it with a pokeball|`|ae314cdf78b8dbe36bbb4b7044798130aa	the dusk ball is the fastest way to catch right next to ultra ball so I would use the dusk ball.<br>  <br>  P.S. it worked for me.|`|lAEVCIRZaa	Lower his HP down to red or yellow then throw 4 ultra and 1 dusk ball it only took me 6-7 turns to capture him

I would set up an investment plan with enough income to live very comfortably for the rest of my life without having to draw down the principal (assuming a 4.5% return on investment, $20M would pay $75K per month before taxes).  <br>  <br>  I would set up a couple of charitable foundations to continue helping others.  At least one in Canada for helping kids get an education, and one in the Philippines (my wife is from there) for education. <br>  <br>  I would buy a house in canada; not sure where.  I would also buy a house in the Philippines so we could travel back and forth (Note:  $400K would buy an absolute mansion there).  I would of course buy a vehicle or two (Corvette Z06, wahooooo!!!!) and likely a few other toys.<br>  <br>  It goes without saying that a comprehensive will would drawn up.  I would think an attorney on retainer to take of of issues with the foundations and other stuff would be a good idea.  Not cheap, but likely necessary.  <br>  <br>  Then, the wife and kids (we don't have any yet, but are working on it) would travel and enjoy life.  Would likely spend the summers when the kids are school age in the Philippines, as we would want them educated in Canada (less trouble getting the education recognized elsewhere).<br>  <br>  Nice to dream, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Oh, and I would never fly coach again!!  Canada to the Philippines in coach is not the most pleasant experience in the world.|`|znVWtyu6aa	I cant say how it would change my life because money is a scary thing.

Blasphemed contra el Ra, rey de dioses y de los hombres, y los magos buscaban la manera de derrotar a los dioses, usando sus fuerzas los dioses habían dado a los hombres objetos y tierras para que prosperaran. <br>  Ra, al oír hablar de las intenciones de los humanos, se reunió con el resto de los dioses, y ellos aconsejaron que llamara a Sekhmet, la fuerza contra la cual ninguna otra fuerza sirve, para que se manifestara en la tierra y calmara la rebelión. <br>  Sekhmet se manifestaría y castigaría todos los que habían sostenido la rebelión contra los dioses. <br>  Luego Sekhmet caminó entre hombres y los destruyó y bebió su sangre. <br>  Una noche después de que Sekhmet había bebido la sangre y rasgado los cuerpos de los humanos, los dioses decidieron que la matanza había sido suficiente y que debía parar, pero los dioses no encontraban manera de parar la matanza , ya que Sekhmet había bebido toda la sangre de los revolucionarios. <br>  Mientras que continuó la carnicería, los dioses reconocieron que Sekhmet, y su rabia por la intoxicación hacia aun peor la matanza, y sabían que no pararía hasta que la vida humana se extinguiera. Entonces Ra que había traído ciertas plantas colosales de la familia de la Solanaceae y que de ella se pueden elaborar drogas muy potentes para alterar la mente. Esa planta, y posiblemente también opio o cá?amo, fueron enviados al dios Sekti en Heliopolis. <br>  Sekti agregó estas drogas a una mezcla de cerveza y sangre humana, llenando siete mil grandes jarros de la sustancia. Los jarros fueron llevados a un lugar donde Sekhmet pasaría y se vertió sobre la tierra, inundando los campos. Y cuando Sekhmet vino a estos campos y percibió lo que ella pensó que era sangre, ella se regocijo y bebió todo el líquido. Entonces " su corazón fue llenado de alegría, " su mente fue cambiada, y ella no pensó más en destruir . <br>  Después de eso, Ra trató a Sekhmet como si las matanzas no lo hubieran molestado, elogiando la belleza y el encanto de la diosa <br>  <br>  Las leyendas de vampiros se originaron de este a oeste en compa?ía de las caravanas a lo largo de la ruta de la seda por el Mediterráneo. <br>  De allí se extendieron a Asia y luego a las tierras Eslavas y los Cárpatos. <br>  Los mitos estaban originalmente más estrechamente asociados con Irán, entonces emigraron alrededor del siglo VIII, a donde están ahora. Casi en cuanto llegaron, el proceso de cristianización empezó y las leyendas de vampiros sobrevivieron como mitos. <br>  Más tarde los Gitanos emigraron desde norte hacia el oeste de la India (donde tienen varios mitos de vampiros), ya allí sus mitos se mezclaron con los del pueblo Eslavo. <br>  Los Gitanos llegaron a Transilvania brevemente antes de que Vlad Tepes Drácula naciera en 1431. <br>  El vampiro aquí era el fantasma de una persona muerta, que en la mayoría de casos habían sido una bruja, mago etc. <br>  Se tiene miedo a los vampiros, porque ellos matan personas pero al mismo tiempo se parecen a ellas. Pero hay ciertas cosas que los diferencian de un ser vivo, no puede proyectar ningún tipo de sombra ni se puede reflejar en ningún espejo. Además los vampiros pueden cambiar de forma, como por ejemplo la de un murciélago y eso lo hace sumamente difícil de capturar. <br>  Al empezar un nuevo día los vampiros tienen que dormir en sus ataúdes por que los rayos del sol los matarían, pero por la noche despiertan sedientos de sangre. <br>  La forma más común de nutrirse es atravesar por una ventana, en forma de murciélago y entonces morder a la víctima en el cuello y succionarle toda la sangre. <br>  Los vampiros no pueden entrar a una casa sin ser invitados, pero en cuanto tienen el permiso, pueden entrar tan a menudo como ellos quieran. <br>  El vampiro no es peligroso solo porque mata a las personas sino porque sus víctimas después de muertas se convierten en vampiros. <br>  El lado mas fuerte de los vampiros es que son casi inmortales, sólo algunos ritos muy especiales poden matarlos tal como: poner una estaca en su corazón, cortar su cabeza o quemar su cuerpo. <br>  <br>  Habilidades <br>  Transformación: La mayoría de vampiros tienen la habilidad de transformarse en un animal, que normalmente es un murciélago, rata, lobo, ara?a o cuervo. Muchos vampiros pueden transformar aun su cuerpo en una nube de niebla. También pueden transformarse en animales de apariencia domestica, como cerdos, caballos o perros. <br>    <br>  <br>  Energía: Otra habilidad típicamente entre vampiros es la energía y sentidos humanos mas agudos. La habilidad de la energía consiste en lanzar impulsos para mover objetos o humanos, abrir puertas, etc. También pueden destrozar cuerpos con la constricción (anillo energético que comprime la víctima). <br>  <br>  Dominio: Esta es la habilidad más rara de estas tres. La habilidad de convocar y dominar diferentes tipos de animales que principalmente serían los mismos en que se convierte. Los más comunes son el murciélago y en segundo lugar el lobo. <br>  <br>  El Ataúd: Casi todos los vampiros tienen que dormir en su ataúd durante el día. Originalmente se hizo el ataúd, para que los animales no excavaran arriba el cuerpo. Además, al viajar (sólo en algunas razas) el vampiro debe llevar tierra de su lugar de origen. <br>  <br>  Luz del sol: Casi todos los vampiros son muy sensibles a los rayos solares, muchos son debilitados por ellos y los da?a, depende de la especie, pero puede llegar a matarlos. En la novela de Bram Stoker "Drácula" el no era afectado tan fuertemente por la luz del sol, pero mermaba sus poderes. <br>  <br>  Símbolos religiosos: En la mayoría de los casos el símbolo no basta para da?ar a un vampiro, para que surta efecto, el portador de el símbolo, tal como la cruz cristiana, debe tener fe en el símbolo. de otra forma no surtirá efecto. A veces el símbolo no hace falta que sea religioso. <br>  Este sistema está solamente escrito por gentes religiosas, y jamás ha quedado totalmente confirmado que surta efecto. <br>  <br>  Reflejo: Los Vampiros no se pueden reflejar en espejos. La razón es que dado que los vampiros están muertos no tienen alma consecuencia, no pueden reflejarse en los espejos. Más tarde da lugar a la creencia de que los vampiros no aparecen en las fotos. Se puede matar un vampiro por ponerlo directamente entre dos espejos, atravesando su alma. <br>  <br>  Agua corriente : Los vampiros no pueden cruzar el agua en movimiento tales como ríos. <br>  <br>  Razas <br>  Aclaración: Estas son creencias particulares de cada región, lo que significa que si bien hay muchas criaturas que no se parecen a los vampiros o bien son demonios en algunas regiones eran considerados vampiros. <br>  Aquí hay algunas "razas" de vampiros: <br>    <br>    <br>  Asanbosam:Asanbosam es un vampiro Africano.

Unas leyendas dicen que la estaca tiene que ser de un tipo especial de madera tal como el fresno. La razón de esta creencia es que el corazón es asiento de vida y poder. Generalmente basta solo con clavar la estaca en el corazón. Pero en algunos casos concretos es necesario atravesar el cuerpo y clavar la estaca en el ataúd. <br>    <br>  Decapitación: La razón es que el cerebro también era el segundo asiento de vida. Si también corta la cabeza de un vampiro le estará quitando su vida. Como en el caso anterior, hay casos especiales, que deben ser decapitados con plata pura. <br>  <br>  Cremación: Quemar el cuerpo, parece ser un método muy común y casi universal de librarse de un vampiro. Si el vampiro tiene carácter demoníaco, se le debe matar con la mezcla de plata y fuego, como a los demonios summerios. <br>  <br>  Espejos: Se puede matar un vampiro por ponerlo directamente entre dos espejos. <br>    <br>  Agua corriente: Los vampiros no pueden cruzar el agua en movimiento tales como ríos etc. siendo esta una forma segura de matarlos, ej.: poniendo su cuerpo después de decapitado en un río. <br>  <br>  Enterrarlo con la cabeza hacia abajo: Si se sospecha que alguien puede llegar a ser un vampiro, el modo de prevenirlo es enterrar el cuerpo hacia a bajo. <br>  <br>  Perro con ojos de ángel: La manera de aullentar a un vampiro es con un perro completamente ***** y que en su cabeza sobre los ojos tenga pintado dos ojos de ángel de color blanco. <br>  <br>  Metal:  Si se sospecha que alguien puede llegar a ser un vampiro, se le puede enterrar con un pedazo de metal en la mano, para evitar la metamorfosis. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ya se que es un poco largo espero que te sirva !...<br>  besoss...y suerte! a mi tmb me gustan mucho esas clases de cosas...|`|mwD5Fertaa	Si son personas a las cuales las muerden otros vampiros y se transforman también en vampiros,la luz les hace quemaduras,por eso odian el sol,pueden morir si les clavas una estaca de madera en el corazón.|`|pULF8RKvaa	pues a mi me gustaria aportar sobre un tema actual <br>  acerca de los vampiros de luz.<br>  <br>  Vampiros de luz<br>  <br>  -Se alimentan de energia en lugar de sangre, la energia la adquieren absorbiendola de los seres vivos, bien sean animales o humanos, al hacer esto ellos  devilitan a las personas pero no las matan. En otros casos adquieren energia acesinando hombres lobo y otras criaturas oscuras de la noche.<br>  <br>  -Tienen enemigos al igual que los vampiros, muchas veces son hombres lobo o vampiros de sangre.<br>  <br>  -Permanesen en clanes , todos allí hacen un juramento de lealtad al clan, si alguno los traiciona seran desterrados y en muchos casos acesinados.<br>  <br>  -Sus devilidades son la sangre y los eclipses, pues ellos adquieren energia tambien con la luz del sol o la luna.<br>  <br>  -Los vampiros de luz al llegar a sierto nivel de experiencia pueden tomar la forma de un animal dependiend de su energia , la mayoria toma forma de cuerbo o lobo<br>  <br>  -Para ser combertido en un vampiro de luz hay que tener la marca de nacimiento o tener energia pura y ser combertido por un vampiro puro.<br>  Su metodo no es una mordida en el cuello sino un beso de el sexo opuesto , es decir para que un hombre sea combertido debe ser besado por un vampiresa de luz y si es una mujer debe ser besada por un vampiro de luz.<br>  <br>  -Normal mente estan casando hombres lobo y peleando con vampiros de sangre, y en los clanes ponen tareas para cada integrante.<br>  <br>  -La apariencia de ellos suele ser con cabello y ojos blancos o azules , y su bestuario es conforme a la ocacion, se supone que todavia existen en secreto, al igual que los vampiros de sangre, y que para ajustarse a la sociedad visten a la epoca , en este caso el siglo XXI, para ocultarse y no llamar la atencion.

alTCzzU1aa	dude make a map, like a pernament map. the when ppl join u can send these messages that automatically pop up at the top of the screen that you can write stuff in. For example you made a map and im playling lalallalla then this little box pops up at the corner of my screen that says "go to www.freewebs.com/cssbullet to join this clan" and when your playing and you see someone really good you can ask that person to tryout for your clan. After a while when you get a few good guys you can all join a map together and you start pawning ppl will knotice you and try to join your clan but make sure only good ppl join cuase if someone nooby joins your clan then your clan loses credibility. trust me im in a clan.

4RiJ91mNaa	Yes. The hard drive can save memory and is an overall much better choice than the memory card. The memory card can only save games, while the hard drive can use downloadable content like games and game content. Xbox live is practically useless without a hard drive.|`|o7zDRvWraa	Yes, you can save onto the hard drive, which is nice because you'll never really run out of space.<br>  <br>  The premium bundle is the better deal since you get the hard drive, wireless controller, component cables for HDTVs, and the headset. The core only comes with a wired controller and a composite cable.

It all really depends on how much you download and how much you want to keep.|`|984c9d0fe9ebd92da8b6f4bbaa44c4f8aa	I've owned my 360 for one year and my 20GB has 8GB left - but this is due to holding a few demos and downloaded trailers/free videos. As I do rent a lot of videogames through GameFly, I am still happy with just having 20GB.<br>  <br>  Demos can range from 600MB all the way to 1GB each, but chances are you won't be keeping those for too long. I always "clean house" once in awhile in the hard drive, and I am buying Xbox Live Arcade Games, but am able to keep at least 10GB free at any given time.

To check your  firmware version, turn on the PSP, go to 'Settings', then 'System Settings'  and then 'System Information'. If your PSP has 1.0 firmware,download the 1.5 firmware from the Sony official site, and follow instructions. If your firmware is over 1.5 , download a downgrader from www.psp-hacks.com.       <br>   Once your PSP firmware is 1.5 , download from the internet the custom firmware called 3.51 M33 . Open its readme , and follow the instructions there to install it on the PSP. Once you have 3.51 M33 on the PSP, put the downloaded game into the ISO folder on the PSP. This folder is in the main folder of your device, when you connect it to the PC<br>  . <br>  *PS* you should have a memory stick duo at least 1gb in size. i recommend the 2 gb and the 4 gb cards.<br>  <br>  *DOWNLOAD ONLY FROM TRUSTED SITES*<br>  Confirmed trusted sites are www.psp-hacks.com and www.qj.net .

swaP97Szaa	A lot of people ask me this question on other websites, and I always tell them that it's bad to ask other people which console is the best only because other peoples' favorite console may not be your favorite. I'll try to answer your questions as best I can without actually choosing a console for you.<br>  <br>  The Xbox 360 definitely has the best games now, and the best lineup of games for the holidays. The PS3 doesn't have many great games for it right now, but it's going to get better during the holidays. After that, it's unpredicatable which console will have the best games. However, Microsoft is willing to pay to bring games to their console, and bring exclsuive content for them, whereas Sony said they weren't willing to pay for exclusive games or content, meaning there will be a lot less of them for the PS3.<br>  <br>  Both consoles are pretty good with multimedia. Both allow you to save music onto the console and play them whenever you like from the console, even while playing games. They both also play movies, videos, and allow you to save and view pictures.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend you do some research, and choose for yourself which console you like the most. I have a guide telling the features, and other information about all of the current-gen consoles you can look at if you want. Here's a link to it: <a href="http://forum.runescape.com/forums.ws?23,24,881,44878162" rel="nofollow">http://forum.runescape.com/forums.ws?23,...</a><br>  <br>  You can't post on the thread unless you are a member of that website, but feel free to send me an e-mail or chat with me on Yahoo! Messenger any time, and I'll answer any and all questions that you have. (view my profile to see my Yahoo! e-mail address)<br>  <br>  Edit: The answer above mine is incorrect. He is only trying to convince you the PS3 is the best because it's that user's personal favorite console. Like I said, it's up to you to decide which console is best for you, don't let others decide for you.|`|JedjRKbEaa	The PS3 has the brighter future, it not only supports the new HD era straight out of the box with HDMI input and a Blu-Ray DVD player, but has a longer potential than the 360.  By the time the 360 is getting ready to fade out, the PS3 will still be going strong.  To get similar features out of the 360 you will need to buy the new Elite system for $479, and spend another $199 on an HD DVD player, whereas the PS3 is only $499 now and comes with all that.  Also with games like MGS4, Killzone 2, FFXIII and Heavenly Sword releasing soon, the PS3 is about to explode back onto the map and in a big way very soon.|`|ac4457d6d5d27eb4b80751021b9a3165aa	both systems are gud cause i have them both. rite now i play my 360 alot cause of the awsome games out for it like gears of war, forza 2 and halo 3 is coming out soon.  The ps3 hasnt got many games now but it will have brill games later on in its life.  If u r getting a console now i would go for the 360 cause there is plenty to play and lots of entertainment on xbox live.  if u get the ps3 then u will end up getting board of it and will have to wait a long time for gud games to come out.  At the end of the day it is all bout the games and right now the 360 is where them games r at.  plus u can buy more games since the 360 is cheaper.  so go with the 360.

zYHtbXf7aa	Don't worry, It's fine. I'm on a forum dedicated to helping  with stuff like this. So IV isn't training, They're stats a Pokemon is born with, hidden stats. But you can EV train a Pokemon. Checking IVs is relatively easy, and if you want, you can find out what it is on the forum, if you choose to go there. I'll leave a piece of the EV Guide. The link to the guide and link to the forum will be in the sources.<br>  <br>  ---------------------------<br>  <br>  <br>  [0.1]About this Guide<br>  This guide is a simple guide for EVs or Effort Values. you will learn what they are, how to get them faster, great EV traing spots from R/S/E and D/P. Then you will see which pokemon give which EV and how many.<br>  <br>  [1.1]<br>  Effort Values<br>  <br>  As you may or may not know, EV's are a very important part of training any pokemon. Just starting to be recognized by people other than breeders, EV training helps pokemon become more adept in a certain area. They can be used to give any pokemon the edge in a battle, or keep a pokemon in one. For example, if you wanted to give a Raikou a boost in its Speed, you would simply train it against pokemon that's speed stat is dominant. Another example is if someone wanted to help Tyranitar land a bigger hit with Crunch, which would have that person battle against pokemon that are more dominant in Special Attack.<br>  <br>  With that in mind, let's start with the basics. If you're wondering what "EV" means, it simply means "Effort Value." It makes sense since you need to put your effort into battling certain pokemon in order to get rewarded for your efforts. Effort Values are hidden values, so you can't just look somewhere in the pokemon's statistics to figure out how many Effort Values you have already earned for a certain stat. Because of this limit, calculating Effort Values requires you to record each pokemon, or at least the EVs gained from the pokemon. If you want an easy way to do this, just make a chart with six columns, label them according to the six different stats, and place a tally for each point gained in the stat.<br>  <br>  So now you're in a battle. Keep in mind that only battles where EXP counts gives you an Effort Point, so no battling over a link cable or battle tower to get Effort Points. Anyway, you have a Linoone, and you just defeated a Zubat. Now, just like a pokemon's Base Values are set in stone (like Slaking always having a base value of 160 in Attack), EVs are the same way. Anyone who's ever trained a Zubat knows that the dominant stat is Speed, so if you look at the Speed EV chart, you will see that Zubat gives 1 EV to Speed. Most of the time, it's this easy. But sometimes you will find that a pokemon gives EVs in an odd stat, like Charizard giving 3 EVs to Special Attack or that a pokemon gives EVs to more than one stat, like Venusaur giving 2 EVs to Special attack and 1 EV to Special Defense. Just watch out for those things.<br>  <br>  Now to explain how these work. Say the Linoone battled 4 Zubats and aquired 4 EVs in the pokemon's Speed EV. When it levels up, it will gain one more point to its Speed stat than if it had battled three Zubats and one Geodude (1 EV to Defense). This is because for every 4 Effort Points you get towards a certain stat, you get one point more to the stat. If you wish for a less technical explanation, let's call each Effort Value a Piece of Heart, like in any Legend of Zelda game. If you get four Pieces of Heart, you get a Heart Container. It's the same way with Effort Values. Of course, there has to be a limit to this, seeing as if you battled 3,996 Zubats, you would have a lot of time on your hands, and a Linoone with 999 located in its Speed stat.<br>  <br>  So, what are the limits? Well for starters, you can only gain 510 Effort Values before they will stop being counted. 510 can be called our "Overall Maximum", if you want a technical term. So this brings the Effort Points you can gain to 64, once again as a maximum. But this is still a bit much to add to any one stat, and it would make any Mewtwo have an absurd amount of Special Attack still, or Blissey still having that huge potential to go over 700 Hit Points (not like you still can't get there.) So, to make it limited still, there can only be a maximum of 255 Effort Points per stat, giving a pokemon a potential 32 point increase in any stat.<br>  <br>  So now, in terms of pokemon you have to battle, let's say you want that Linoone to get its maximum speed. You would have to battle 255 Zubats to get to the maximum speed value; EV training for any more Speed will become useless if you choose to continue after 255. Now, I can imagine some of you thinking, "Wow, I don't want to battle 255 pokemon to fill up on Speed EVs." Well the good news is that you don't. The maximum points you can get for any selected stat is 255, right? That's exactly what it is, a maximum.

VLS16mVraa	honestly since they are thinking about moving final fantasy over to the 360 since that's what you are into then i would get a 360. The games on it will rock your world and because the playstation 3 has crappy games to begin with right now don't even think about that one. Also they will stop making games for the xbox and ps2 so sooner or later you will have to upgrade. I would do it sooner rather than later.|`|V36HUngZaa	yeah, its the best of the new-gen systems...<br>  <br>  there are a few greats like Gears of War and the Call of Duty series...<br>  <br>  plus theres great online play...<br>  <br>  but im not sure what games are out that you would enjoy...|`|UQbnFGPcaa	Well, if you like Metal Gear and Kingdom Hearts...You might be better off with a Playstation 3. Those two game are most likely gonna stay on the Playstation.<br>  <br>  The 360 is a great system as it is with its huge library of fun games. The 360 is getting lots of attention from the RPG genre this time around also. Expect to see loads of good RPG's coming out in this year alone.<br>  <br>  I personally own a 360, PS3, and a Wii. The PS3 collects dust, the Wii gets played on occasions, and the 360 gets used the most.|`|cICFlg3Paa	Id only get the Elite if i had a tv that could support it.  <br>  <br>  the 360 has the best (in my opinion) game library.  Crackdown, Halo3, Gears just to name a few.  just get a regular white one.  you dotn need 120 gigs or whatever the new harddrive is.  <br>  <br>  and since your only in 8th grade, dont get a summer job unless you REALLy want stuff.  cause yeah, i ahd a job when i was that age and it ....sucked..
AA11612795	Do you mean the 360?<br>  <br>  There is no Co-op modes for Call of Duty 3.  The campaign is single player only.  The multiplayer consists of Deathmatch (called Battle in the game) and other standard multiplayer games where you fight with and against other people over Xbox Live.
FnmyBZUOaa	First get your starter in the first box and you will have to do some work get it to lvl 60 at least then take 1 flying type 1 water type and your favorate pokemon. Then the rest are your choice. use your exp share and train your pokemon try going to places where the trainers are stronger. The champion is tricky so use your starter if you started with totera do not fight flare or flitch or wat ever the fire guys name is use your water type. If you have a stardaptor it can learn some seriously powerfull moves at lvl 60 or 70. Like close combat witch will almost kill anybody in your way.|`|8KabegVuaa	The elite four is pretty hard, it took me a few tries. Just remember, the champion is WAY harder. I can't help u out, cuz i cheated. well sorta, i focused all of my time and leveled up only my infernape. just keep battling them, you'll beat them eventually|`|BfA5cYxdaa	I suggest you keep on training with the elite four. I battle the elite four for experience and keep on doing it until i get to the end. A well rounded team sould help you also. Cynthia, the champion is one hard person to beat.

EV22IhwPaa	Yes, but before you sell your regular Xbox, see how much you can trade it in for, then get all the money except for what you can get from your regular Xbox, and then sell your regular Xbox.<br>                                                                            <br>  An easier way to understand what's above: Keep your Xbox until you get all the money needed except for what you can trade your Xbox in for, then buy a Xbox 360.<br>  <br>  So lets say you want the $400 Xbox 360, and you can trade in your regular Xbox for $100. So you would save up $300, then go trade in your regular Xbox, so you could still play your Xbox while trying to save up for a Xbox 360.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful, and not too confusing!|`|cnLGOAwsaa	Yes, just buy a 360 with an HDD so you can play all your existing Xbox games.|`|4ac1d65fbeeae2dc584df9ab9b6abecbaa	Your probably only going to get about $20-40 for your Xbox, they don't make games for it a anymore and you can't get a Xbox Live account for it anymore either.<br>  <br>  But you should defnitely get a 360, it is the best gaming console out there right now!|`|DoAMqyW6aa	I would recommend that you keep your XBox and just save up for a 360.  You're not going to get much for an XBox nowadays and it would not be cool to be stuck without one while you wait for the other.<br>  <br>  Another thing to keep in mind:  Not all XBox games are backwards compatible on the XBox 360.
zaDCk3Heaa	If you are using no$gba then you should try going to options then choose emuator options and look for nds catridge backup media and choose something off of the list and reset the game to see if that option works. Keep on trying all the options and if none of them work you can either wait for a working nds emulator to come out or you can go buy a ds like I did.

rY23uewCaa	I have both systems I play both systems and I love both systems.<br>  <br>  with that said PS3 is obviously more powerful, you can tell in it's first string of games.<br>  great games will come (remember 360 had a huge head start.) the PS3 hasn't even been out a year yet.<br>  <br>  Now I don't know about these people saying the 360 is cheaper.... it acually cost more if your gonna go full next gen (and why buy it if your not)<br>  PS3 is $600 with everything<br>  XBOX 360 is like $800 with everthing plus $50 a year for xbox live<br>  the breakdown:<br>  xbox elite= $479<br>  xbox live= $50 per yr<br>  wireless adapter= $100<br>  HDDVD drive= $200<br>  add that up people (and this is why Bill Gates is rich)<br>  <br>  360 has the better games out right now(love Gears of war) and xbox live is setup better than the Plastation network to me. (but it been running for like 3 or 4yrs)<br>  <br>  I think either way you go you'll win.<br>  but in my opinion PS3 will edge the 360
Bfv7srXfaa	Motorstorm by far.  Spider-man 3 was not a terrible game, but is not worth $60.  Motorstorm has amazing graphics and brutal off-road racing, the second best PS3 game out there, in my opinion.|`|AA10770705	spider man 3|`|rY23uewCaa	LOL.....those games aren't in the same category but ok....<br>  (I have them both )<br>  <br>  if you like all the other spider-man games you'll like this one. it looks better, it's long and you can use the symboite suit. other than that it's the same type of game.<br>  <br>  Motorstorm has better replay value and better graphics and if you like racing you'll love it. and the courses are huge.<br>  <br>  so i would say motorstorm is better.<br>  unless you just like swinging around New York City.|`|P8GKOB0Qaa	Motorstorm|`|qIOxvH0Uaa	motorstorm

ad5d67296684b0439afcae351b77654eaa	I believe you are trying to test the ability of many game designers out there. Non-downloadable means mainly a flash or java platform, if not the normal text type given by csl and other website codes. MMORPG+3D graphics means a server and a program that can fully utilize that server to its full capacity to prevent lag and still calculate at fast rates. 3D MMORPGs that don't need downloading are way off somewhere; maybe something to look forward to, but don't push the button. For one, runescape is one option, but it leaves non-members on limited ends and is far from decent in the way you want it. I don't know any else. Maybe one of us can be the one to make this possible, hehe.|`|3KlH3ivhaa	yes maidmarian.com has a butt-ton of them i suggest sherwood

ecDQ3XKYaa	keeping on hitting a allows your teammates more time to either help you or you could even get up your self. sometimes the opponent downs you, waits for you to get up and then kills you, however you can escape that. hitting a helps.|`|JedjRKbEaa	No correct time to press A when you are downed, just gotta press it quickly.  However, if you are playing multiplayer, it depends on what setting you are playing as to whether or not you can get back up.  Execution style, if you tap A, you can be revived.  War zone, tapping A will only get you sore fingers, you can only get back up if someone revives you.  Hope that helped.|`|8axPfFRFaa	I dont usually tap a at all, everytime ive tapped it it seems like i die quicker than normal, so i just wait for a team mate to pick me up.|`|JDSQym0Paa	Here's the deal with the A button.<br>  <br>  If you are playing a Warzone match and go down, you will bleed to death unless a teammate revives you. The host sets the amount of time it takes to bleed out before the match starts. Pressing A when you're down slows down your bleed out, thus giving you more time than the bleedout time setting for a teammate to revive you.<br>  <br>  If you're playing an Execution match and go down, you will stay down for a set amount of time. Again, this is set by the host before the match. When you are down, your enemies can "execute" you easily. Pressing the A button speeds up your recovery, thus allowing you to recover quicker than the pre-set time.<br>  <br>  In regards to pressing the A button, it's really just a case of hitting it as fast as possible. The more you hit it, the more effective it is.<br>  <br>  Happy hunting!!

zYHtbXf7aa	Heatran<br>  +-+-+-+<br>  Fire/Steal<br>  +-+-+-+<br>  Flash Fire<br>  +-+-+-+<br>  Scary Face<br>  Lava Plume<br>  Fire Spin<br>  Iron Head<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are interested in catching Heatran, I assume that you have already beaten the Elite 4, acquired the National Pokedex, and traveled to the Battle Zone. Bring a Pokemon with Strength, Rock Smash, and Rock Climb and buy an Escape Rope or two.<br>  <br>  You'll need to go Stark Mountain. The most hassle free way to get there is to start from the Resort Area. Travel North on Route 229, through 228 the desert-ish area to Route 226/227 where you'll continue to go north.<br>  <br>  After some Trainers and aggravated wild Pokemon, you'll reach Stark Mountain. You'll see your rival and Buck, the Red Haired trainer that welcomed you to the Battle Zone. He'll run ahead. Follow him and you two will partner up. Make your way through the cave, once your reach the end Buck will find the Magma Stone and run off with it. This means you have to go and find him.<br>  <br>  Leave the cave and make it to the Survival Area, west of Stark Mountain. Buck will be in his house just to the left of the Pokemon Center. Talk to him, and he'll run out again to try and replace the Magma Stone.<br>  <br>  Return to Stark Mountain. If you don't want to fight any Pokemon, bring a Super Repel. Use it at the entrance of the Mountain and use Rock Climb to get back to the place where the Magma Stone was found. Save before you enter, though. Because You'll be fighting a Lv.70 Heatran with a decent move set. One that isn't caught easily. I suggest fighting at night and bringing a couple Lv. 60 or higher water Pokemon. A few surfs and its heath will be low. Good Luck.|`|lpCXAhWiaa	get him last becuase i thought he was the dullest of the legendaries, but if you really like him go for him first. i would have a couple lvl 100 pokemon on me because a few of his moves can be powerful. i caught him with a timer ball. i always get them with a timer ball...|`|03e3602b85b9aa9c73662e01d0c89effaa	at night....use him on pokeman the video game|`|LXea7SJraa	when you think you have the right pokemon and use a dusk ball on him|`|YMUYSIa4aa	whenever|`|fd35c59d7cfcb88caa4a766988ed68a9aa	It is best to catch heatran after you have gotten sumting like scyther wit false swipe. False swipe is a move that always leaves 1 hp on the oposing pokemon. I have a lvl 100 sceptile wit false swipe and i caught heatran wit it. U shud use dusk balls on it. But u might wanna start out just throwing a quick ball on it from the beggining. Also keep sum timer balls. You can throw those after like 20 turns. U will surely catch it if u bring those balls wit u.|`|rGaK9yCVaa	Try giving him a status problem except for poison and make sure he is very weak and buy as many dusk balls as you can and use those.
dJs8GN3Qaa	You view all of your Pokemon, and then click on the link by them that says "Put up for trade."  This dude above me doesn't know what you're talking about.  No offense, mister!|`|6gkeQ2Jtaa	u can't trade. you can put your pokemon up for sale and take the best bid. it kinda ruins that aspect of the pokemon game in exchange for players being able to battle online.

AA12074143	Totodile. Best stats, good dark attacks, and can learn ice moves so it'll pwn any other starter pokemon. It has highest special stats and is good from lowest level to level 100. Chikorita loses it's supremacy early and typhlosion may be good but it's not worth the vast amount of time being wasted on it compared to totodile. Only downside is croconaw is worst 2nd stager.|`|S00YuJAAaa	I reckon Totodile because he is really strong on all of his evolutions. He will also help u heaps in the game especially at the end of the game.|`|jekM3Q7Iaa	cyndaquil is the best to chose because it is the  becease of the gym battles in Johto|`|szYlTBRhaa	Depends. it doesnt really matter. just pick wat u like. but my opinion is cydaquil because i like his last form, Typhlosion, and im also a fan of fire type|`|ryKbwPxGaa	chikorita totally|`|7e9ea8e4223fcf6d507ac65547ed41f9aa	i would have 2 say totodile because of its egg move dragon dance so try 2 get one female and breed it with a tyranitar with dragon dance (hint breed gyrados with dratini dratini with lapras and then lapras with larvitar then u know the rest)|`|vZ3Pm4Foaa	well mostly just get the one that you need help with if you need help with fire get cyndaquil if you need help with grass chikorita and water todile. i realy also like cyndaquil cause he evolves into someone cool. plus he has realy good fire moves.

However, my Tyrogue won't evolve into a Hitmonlee, so make sure you want another Hitmonchan.|`|a4376a10f9ba13d8fe51a78e5ed76eeeaa	First of all ditto doesn't have a gender hearts.And second Make sure hitmonchan is a female.|`|fIMhYaIwaa	Well make sure the Ditto is an opposite gender the pokemon your breeding it with.

CyfwFY00aa	Easy Arena Wins  <br>  To do this glitch/hint, go to the arena in the Imperial City. Join an Arena battle, and make sure you have a bow and a lot of arrows (200 should be enough). Once the battle starts, go into the center, turn right, and there should be a small section of the wall sticking out. Jump on it, and keep jumping. Eventually, the enemy will hit you up on top, and you can just keep shooting them until you win.  <br>  <br>  Easy Imperial Arena  <br>  Get a bow or some decent spells. Make sure you have at least 30 in Acrobatics. Immediately after the gate drops, run to your right, to where the right gate meets the fence. Jump onto the stone piece that juts out, then jump again to get on top of the little piece sticking out above it. Once on top, turn and fire on your helpless victims. When you have to fight mages or archers, stay on the ground and strafe behind the four central pillars for easy kills.  <br>  <br>  Easy Conjuration Level  <br>  Near the town of Bruna, go east, then southeast. If you reach The Red Ruby Cave you went too far. You will need to go back west slightly. You should see a shrine, that once activated, will give you Conjuration points as well as a temporary bound weapon and/or greaves. You can keep activating the shrine every 24 hours. Wait in front of it for 24 hours, then activate it again. Repeat this as many times as desired.<br>  <br>  Easy Speech Level  <br>  Find a person whom you do not care about them liking you (preferably a guard). Go into Persuade mode and rapidly rotate the Left Analog- stick and tap A. It does not matter what you pick; just rotate and tap. You can go over level 40 Speech in about five minutes.  <br>  <br>  Keeping Spells From The Beginning Dungeon  <br>  In the beginning of the game when your in the dungeon, you have two spells (flare and minor health something), but when you leave the dungeon they go away. If you hot key the two spells you can keep them after you leave the dungeon, but I don't think they are shown in your list of spells, but you can still use them.  <br>  <br>  Unlimited Gold  <br>  In Imperial City - Talos District there is a home in the South East section of a man named Dorian. Wait till nightfall where the door is locked. Pick the door and enter the home. When he sees you he will demand that you leave the home. At this time kill him. When you loot his body, his gold will never decrease. So you can keep clicking on his gold over and over forever until you get the number of gold you want!  <br>  <br>  Easy Arena Grand Champion  <br>  Talk to the "Grey Prince" before you do any arena matches he will give you a quest to find a diary of his fathers. After completing this quest he become aware that he is half vampire, and when you are able to face him in the arena he will let you kill him without a fight.  <br>  <br>  Duplicate Items  <br>  First, get arrows and a bow. I'd recommend 30 arrows or under, or the game may freeze. Then, equip both. Pull back your arrow, and keep your hand on the right trigger. Press B to go into your inventory screen. Press X to drop the item you wish to duplicate. Then, exit the inventory screen, and there should be as many items in front of you as you had arrows. Note: This may not work with bigger items, such as Armor.  <br>  <br>  Free Arrows  <br>  In the game you have to go to the Arena in Imperial and when you go to the front door you must then walk through the door to your left. Then walk down the stairs and watch the guys shooting arrows. Once he shoots an arrow run up to the hay target and pic up the arrow. You will not be arrested for taking his arrow. Keep doing this if you want unlimited iron arrows.  <br>  <br>  Permanent Enchantments  <br>  Use the following trick for duplication or a permanent enchantment. You can duplicate a drop- able item, and if that item is equipable with constant effect enchantments you can make them permanent. However, the item once made permanent cannot be re-equipped, but each enchanted item is different. You can use the "Duplicate items" trick to make as many as desired, then sell them. Use the "Duplicate items" trick with a bow an arrows to duplicate the items to make permanent. Equip one of the items you want to make permanent. There must be an unequipped version still in your inventory for this to work. Use the "Duplicate items" trick again; however, drop the unequipped version of the item you have equipped and want to make permanent. The equipped one and the others will drop and you will never be able to equip that item again, but if you check your stats the items bonuses will be permanent. You can duplicate anything that can be dropped, including Grand Soul Gems with Grand Souls captured. This trick only works with wearable items. Take any wearable item with a magical enchantment that you wish to make permanent and use the "Duplicate items" trick to duplicate it twice so that you have two of that item. Pick up the item and equip one. While you are wearing that item, duplicate the one you are not wearing by at least four. Note: The number of arrows used determines how many copies are made. Both items will drop on the ground in stacks of two. You will now no longer be wearing that item, but will still have its effects. Note: These effects are permanent. Do not attempt this with any item with an effect you may want to remove later, such as Water Walking, Night Eye, etc.  <br>  <br>  Easy Experience  <br>  This trick requires that your character has a major skill of Sneak and either Destruction or Alteration. If your skills are Sneak and Destruction, gain access to Arcane University. Go to the area to make spells. Make a Drain Health spell that is set to "Self" and only uses 1 Magicka. Then, go upstairs. Go into Sneak mode and just run into the wall without stopping. Activate the magic spell (RB) repeatedly to gain levels quickly. Note: When you activate the magic spell it will seem as if it is hurting you, but it is not. If your skills are Sneak and Alteration, go into a room with a container (for example, cupboard, drawers, etc.). Run into the container in Sneak mode and use a "open very easy lock" repeatedly on the container. Use the following trcik for easy experience in Leyawiin (Blade, Blunt, Destruction, Hand-To- Hand, Marksman, and Sneak). Go to Leyawiin and find Rosentia Gallenus' House. She has four Scamps. You can kill them and more will respawn. Sneak attack with a blade, mace, or hand-to-hand. Then, use a bow and cast fire. Note: If you use your bow, the arrows are hard to get back. If you finish the quest you cannot do this anymore. Go to Cloud Ruler Temple northwest of Bruma. Walk up the big stairs and you will see two Blades sparing. Stand close to them for a minute and your Blade and Block skills will increase by 2. Note: This can only be done once.  <br>  <br>  Easy Master Of Light And Heavy Armour  <br>  First go to Anvil and join the Fighters Guild. Ask for the Rats contract from Azzan. Go speak to the Dark Elf and she will say a mountian lion is killing her rats. Go the basement kill the lion. Look at the rats and make sure they have a desent amount of health, if there low wait a hour. Remove your weapon and attack each rat once dont kill them. Run to a corner and wait they'll case you and attack you, just wait there and let them hit you. Make sure you have enough health potions. When your armour is low or destroyed go back upstairs, the rats dont follow you. If your good at armouror skill repair your eqiupment or go get it repaired. Go back and repeat this at least 3 or 4 more times. This will also give you a 5 level head start on the game  <br>  <br>  The Pants Glitch  <br>  This glitch is pointless but is very fun. Go to Skingrad and kill Tamika at her house. Search her body and take the tan linens as many times as you want (the more the better) and you should see your weight rise. When you have a lot of pants equip and drop each one in a repeqted pattern and return to the game once they have individually been dropped. You should see a lot of pants falling from the sky and your Xbox 360 will lag. When it lags it makes it look like you are in the Matrix. To make the lagging stop simply walk away from the pants.  <br>  <br>  Easy Mercantile And Money  <br>  First of you need a weapon of 200 gold or more and Horse(doesn't matter what kind). So you get on the horse and travle to Kvatch. Find a female Orc with cornrows and talk to her, make sure your on the horse. Then try to sell the weapon and when you do the weapon will stay but your glod will increase and your Mercantile skill also.  <br>  <br>  Vampire Cure/Cash  <br>  First you have to complete the Cure for Vampirism mission, and talk to The Count, Janus Hassidor. When you talk to him, ask him about the "Reward" conversation option, but don't leave the conversation, and keep asking him about it. Everytime you ask him about it you receive 1000 gold (or more depending on your level). Do this as many times as desired for unlimited gold. Note that a recent June patch has fixed this glitch  <br>  <br>  Difficulty  <br>  When you pause the game go into options. Go to Gameplay, and it should be right there. Move the crouser to the right to make it hard, or to the left to make it easy.  <br>  <br>  Duplicate Items  <br>  You will need any bow and 2 different types of arrows. Equip the bow, then lightly push LT. When the arrow is about to fire switch to the other set of arrows and push the A twice. Then drop the item you want to duplicate. The amount of arrows you double click on is the amount of duplicated item you will get. This does not work with some enchanted weapons and quest items. <br>  <br>  Easy Sneak  <br>  Make sure that someone is in the room and can't see you, then go into sneak mode and start walding against a wall and your sneak will keep on going up.  <br>  <br>  Easy Illusion  <br>  (Need a charm spell) Go to a chapel and find somone who is sitting down. Keep casting charm spells on them and you should be a master in Illusion in no time.  <br>  <br>  Get An Elven Longsword  <br>  Follow the road that is northeast of Leyawiin. You should find three houses in a place called Blackenmarch. All you need to do is follow the road. In one of the three houses is a man with a elven longsword. Kill him and take the longsword. It does anywhere from 8-10 damage.  <br>  <br>  Easy Level-up/ Money  <br>  First you have to join the thieves guild (wait 6 hours in the Waterfront, get the letter, go to the meeting spot, and do what that Christophe guy says) and go to Bruma. You will meet a member of the theives guild in Olav's place. Make sure you have alot of lock-picks (buy 100 for 600 gold from that guy at Olav's) be sure to wait until 10:00 p.m, and go to lots of houses and shops. Be sure to be sneaking, because that's the only way you'll level up. Empty out the houses of all the stuff you can get, without getting caught, and take them to that thieves guild member at Olav's. Sell the stuff, and do it again! It made me thousands of gold!!!  <br>  <br>  Joining The Dark Brotherhood  <br>  If you like killing people then this is the place for you. Simply kill a person then go to bed and fall asleep. When you wake up a man in a black armor will be standing next to your bed. He will talk to you as soon as you wake up. Do as he says and you will become a member of the Dark Brotherhood.  <br>  <br>  Floating Items  <br>  To do this trick all you have to do is go to your inventory menu and hit select the item you want to make float and hit B. Then the item should be floating right in front of you while you do this you can still attack and pick up weapons.  <br>  <br>  500 Gold  <br>  Alright first, get like 20 or 30 lock picks, wait until that "betting" guy leaves for the night. Go pick the lock, press "X" however many times you need to until you open the chest there should be like 500 gold, oh and if you don't know the chest is right there when you walk in.  <br>  <br>  Disappearing Staff  <br>  This is a really pointless thing to do, but it's cool (bear with me)! You need to have access to the arcane university in order to do this without facing the guards. When the arch mage kills himself, go into his quarters and take Henantier's Ice Staff. Go to your house or someplace very far away from the university. When you're there, go into your inventory and drop the staff. It should look like it's falling right through the floor!(I'm not sure if this works everywhere, but I know it works on the top floor of Rosethorn Hall, if you want to try it.)|`|DtYee6yBaa	Go to Gamespot.com.....you can check out PC and Xbox versions....|`|SKvKNn7taa	I assume you are talking about the video game Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. If you are on the Xbox360 or PS3 version, there are some duplicating exploits, but I don't know what they are, try googling them.<br>  <br>  If you're on PC, there are tons of mods you can use that could qualify as cheats, try planetelderscrolls. <br>  <br>  Also, there are console commands on PC, which you don't need any additional programs, so if you don't have internet connection on the computer you're playing it on, it's FINE.

Drag it to the dog's mouth and he will eat it!<br>  <br>  Increase Your Route!  <br>  If you take your dog for a walk alot, each time you go for a walk you will be able to walk a lot further.  <br>  <br>  Get A Different Layout!  <br>  When deciding your route to take your dog for a walk, you possibly wont like the amount of ? mark boxes laid out. Well, hit the back arrow, and go into walk again. It'll be a layout of the map!  <br>  <br>  Get Cheaper Dog Supplies!  <br>  If you take your dog for a walk you will see the pet supply store on the map. Well, draw your route to go there. They have cheaper prices than the pet supply store in the menu.  <br>  <br>  Invisi-bone!  <br>  For this to work, you have to have a good relationship one of your dogs. Keep petting him/her (or pet it while it's doing tricks alot) then a bone will appear. Drag it to the dog's mouth with your stylus(pen)and it will eat it!  <br>  <br>  Get Other Dogs  <br>  If you don't like the dogs on any nintendo dogs game all you have to do is get more points. The points are located at go out, info, trainer info, trainer points, then look at how many points you have, the more, the more breeds of dogs.  <br>  <br>  Un-Seen Presents  <br>  When on a walk look at the top screen, if your dog slows down or starts to stop there can be a invisible present there. The best way to see it is if you are running with your dog, but beware it can be garbage!!! (so just pull the leash towards the right-corner to get him/her away)  <br>  <br>  More Presents  <br>  The more you feed and water your dog before a walk, (if it is hungry or thirsty) the better chance there will be a present at the blue question marks.  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskey  <br>  To unlock a Huskey get 4,000 trainer points.  <br>  <br>  Toy Poodle  <br>  Get 8,000 trainer points.  <br>  <br>  Faster!

If you do it enugh times, soon he will bring it back when he catches it.  <br>  <br>  Santa Hat  <br>  Set your DS date to December 25th and you will have a good chance of finding a Santa hat on a walk.  <br>  <br>  Pumpkin  <br>  Set your DS to Halloween (October 31st ) (10-31) and go on a walk you may find a pumpkin at one of the question marks.  <br>  <br>  Pinscher  <br>  To unlock the Pinscher gain 2000 trainer points. <br>  <br>  Desktop Interior  <br>  Get 6,000 trainer points to unlock.  <br>  <br>  Seaside Interior  <br>  Get 12,000 trainer points to unlock.  <br>  <br>  Space Interior  <br>  Get 18,000 trainer points to unlock.  <br>  <br>  Meanest Dog  <br>  When you are on a walk, and you go to a question mark, the meanest dog is Eclair, so get out of there as soon as you can and beware of Coby too! Charlie, and Buster and Logan(when you see him), are nice, and the other dogs are in between. Make sure your dogs is being nice to the other dogs and maybe they will all be nice to you!  <br>  <br>  Washroom Stops  <br>  When you are out on a walk and you see blue dots, those are washroom stops for your dogs. The smaller one is poo and the bigger one is pee. So dont skip them!  <br>  <br>  Trainer Points  <br>  Get trainer points faster by going to the screen that you brush your dog in and but the brush on you dog. You get 1 point every 1 minute! If you leave it on over night then you should turn off the music, so you dont waste the battery and plug it into the charger!  <br>  <br>  Lucky Collar  <br>  If your puppy gives you a 'Lucky Collar' then let the puppy that gave it to you wear it and you will get better gifts from your dog, and win contest more easily and other cool stuff. DONT SELL IT! YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DO!!!!!!!  <br>  <br>  Donate A Dog  <br>  If you don't want a dog you have already, and you already have 8 dogs, then you can go to the Dog Hotel and donate the dog. WARNING: once you donate a dog, you can never get that dog back again, but you can try to adopt another one just like your long lost pup that you donated to the hotel!  <br>  <br>  Yawn  <br>  When you are at the home screen, put the camera on your dog and keep watching it. Eventually, it will yawn. You will notice that the light bulb symbol will appear so it is possible to teach your dog to yawn. This trick takes patience, but if you keep saying it properly, your dog will learn to yawn. This trick is great for the free performance in Obedience trials, so I hope this helps!  <br>  <br>  Get Your Dogs Mad  <br>  If you have a Torador record, turn it up to the highest pace possible. When you put the needle on to the record, your dog(s) will run very fast around the room and then either bark or growl at you. To cheer them back up, take them for a walk or bathe them.  <br>  <br>  Rotate Your Camera View  <br>  When you are at the home screen, pess on the d- pad either left or right to spin the camera in that direction. Also, you can press either A,B,X,or Y to zoom in on your dog.  <br>  <br>  Easy Money!  <br>  Go on a lot of walks and get as many question marks as possible along the way. Then, go to the second hand store and sell all the items you do not want or your dog(s) you do not like. Some items are less then a dollar, but the amount adds up if you continue doing this. Additionally, when going out for walks, it is best to feed and give your dog water just before you go (if it's hungry or thirsty). By doing this, instead of your dog finding trash, they will be much more likely to find presents. You will see a white box with red ribbons around it. Try walking slow because you cannot go backwards. Touch it with the stylus. Your dog will bring it to you. These items are the ones that are worth more. The tri-color ribbon is worth ten dollars, and the Moai Statue is worth one hundred dollars.  <br>  <br>  Raising More Than Three Dogs  <br>  The Dog Hotel will hold up to five dogs at a time. The three that you can raise do not count with the five, making it possible to raise as many as eight dogs.

AA10010715	If it's running too slow try adding more RAM to your computer.|`|7d0iuSf6aa	when u mean download, i hope u mean buy from the store. yes, if u download illegally those games and too many, it will become slow and laggy because most of thosehave viruses.<br>  <br>  if u legally buy them from the store, it should be fine. though it does take a lot of memory to run all the expansions at the same time. i wouldn't recommend getting too many stuff packs or tooo many custom content downloads. those aren't very good at all and use too much memory.<br>  <br>  hope i helped! good luck :)|`|3ca01557de6bc5e62bf443b9eab06cfcaa	yeah.  the more expansion packs you install, the more memory space you use up, and the more memory space you use up, the slower the game runs.|`|AA11157156	Technically yes but running The Sims 2 and all of the expansion packs and stuff packs included can be slow and laggy depending how you're computer is. Just because you have too many sims games does not mean the memory the computer takes up will slow it down. It all matters to having a strong and better graphics card, how much memory left to install those sims games into your computer, having more than 512MB of RAM to run the sims games fast and smooth, and fast computer processor. Basically having the strongest and fastest computer to run The Sims 2 along with the expansion packs installed.|`|oN4wEYbAaa	probably, but thats my fav game ever!
eef676c969e427695b9e2b2da95a3284aa	Big white dog that kinda looked like a husky, that you could sic on your enemies? If that rings a bell, then you're definitely thinking of Shadow Dancer (which I used to play quite a bit myself!).

zjdBowmtaa	where did you get the custom content? if you got it from the official website, the content will be a sims2pack, which you need to double click on. a window will come up and you need to click install. even if you didn't get it from the exchange but it's a sims2pack, that's what you need to do. if you got it from a site other than the exchange, it will probably be a .rar or a .zip. you should download a program called Qxpress, which will install your custom content for you.<br>  <br>  if you've done all that and it still doesn't show up, boot up your game and make sure that custom content it enabled. this will be in the options menu/tab/mode/thingy.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!<br>  <br>  edit: the downloads folder needs to be in the "blah blah blah EA games/the sims 2 deluxe/downloads" in your MY DOCUMENTS folder. you cannot put it in the C://PROGRAM FILES folder. it just won't work.

maLzjlgXaa	There are Demos and Full Game Titles. In the description it should tell you what type it is.

They are saved to your hard drive .|`|YSfh33paaa	Theres Demos which is usually 10 minutes to an hour<br>  and then there xbox originals which are full games from the normal xbox|`|1hJW35DEaa	it int like a store bought game like in a demo you can only play like the first level|`|7PY52driaa	if you just complete a few quick tasks on this site they'll send you an xbox 360, completely free of charge!!|`|dsXTqULkaa	all most all of the time the downloadable games are just 10 or 20 minute demos you can play.

WuM0o7Itaa	get 5 ghouls at the start to nautral creep, and then mass crypt fiends. micro your ghouls so that once the enemy starts hitting the ghouls, move them back making the enemy units get hit by your crypt fiends while chasing after teh ghoul. tech after 2 crypts and research burrow asap. 3rd tier units wont be a match if you keep massing fiends from 2 crypts. Thats because he wont get a chance to get to 2nd or 3rd tier if your pumping out fiends really fast. Build a slaughterhouse and get 2 statues, and research one or two levels of creature defense from the graveyard. For hero, i recommend using DK or Lich depending on your preferance but DK goes a lot better against pally. If the game drags on, get Destroyers. Try to finish the game early though, if he is aiming for 3rd tier units. <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|UuHaG3Ikaa	Make tons of ghouls and necromancers.  Tons.

If you die then try not to do the same thing again. Hiding is for losers who will never get better at the game. Only time I hide for a minute or so is when I'm about to prepare for an airstrike or having a kill streak over 20. If you want to level up quickly try Headquarters and Search and Destroy, but on Search and Destroy make sure you knkow what you are doing before you play because some gamers are very very harsh, verbally, to teammates who aren't aware of what is going on. Good luck!!!|`|AA11022021	try to stay down like when your in the middle of a battle spot.... or just stay hidden it really helps if u don't run around like crazy... its just some little things that will make a big difference|`|F8qxcwXGaa	Try and keep behind cover at most times, red dot sights are good, but if you have good iron sights, try a silencer.  Also, try some things like p90+double tap, m16+double tap, and the rpd.  If you still suck, you could always use juggernoob...
KwrILyaoaa	Webkinz are stuffed animals that were originally released by the Ganz company on April 29, 2005. The toys are similar to many other small plush toys, however they come with a special code on their labels that allows access to the "Webkinz World" which is a website to own a virtual version of the pet for virtual interaction. There are also smaller, less expensive versions of the toys called Lil' Kinz.<br>  <br>  The website for their virtual version is www.webkinz.com|`|AA11109123	A beanie baby that has a URL and a code on a tag on it.

9fb4cd534e41aa4e21bef5ebeddc132eaa	The Dreamcast is about as powerful as the Xbox; they are both 6th generation game systems, they are both 128-bit, and a general rule is that no console of one generation can emulate another from the same generation. So, to answer your question, no. The PS3 probably can't even do it.|`|74ZQIo6Kaa	As far as I know, the Xbox isn't powerful enough to run the Dreamcast. Emulation takes a lot of memory.

XqfH76PMaa	Just keep working on their friendship.  It has to get up to a certain level (I can't remember what that is) before you can suggest it.  Feed them, talk, joke, etc. and up your friendship and see if it doesn't appear.
2dQBQE39aa	Dude, if you don't have an emulator, make sure you download  nulldc (find this by googling). Download a torrent client and torrent an MVC2 rom from iso hunt or another torrent related webiste (can also be found by googling. Download the DC bios, and I think you have to rename it to something like DC_boot.bin. Put it in the data folder. You also need to get the DC flash file and name it to DC_flash.bin, and put it in the data folder as well. This should be sufficient enough to run MVC2. The performance depends on your PC power and your plugins.<br>  7 months ago
fb5e6abe0d15467cb8e98fd9cd776d9daa	Final fantasy, by a LONG shot. I tried playing Kingdom hearts 2 a while ago, I played it for about 6 hours and barely anything happened; basically I found it boring. Yes, I'm sure it has it's moments and gets better, but I gave it a fair chance, and it failed to hold my interest. Final Fantasy sucks you in from the first minute of the game, and keeps you hooked until you've done and got everything, which often takes 100 hrs or more. Any game that can hold my interest for that long is a true great.|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	Final Fantasy... Especially 7-10+12|`|MFnGabuxaa	my personel favourite are the final fantasy games.....absolutly brilliant|`|ALKAzRoRaa	Final Fantasy is the best rpg series but kingdom hearts is the best game ever. Kingdom Hearts have FF characters.<br>  XD|`|KXuJSjmZaa	I would say kindom hearts my reason is becuase its a fun game and its made by the same people by square enix but final fantasy keeps changing the characters every game i got final fantasy 13 and the characters were different but final fantasy is still a boss game but i would go for kingdom hearts and kingdoms hearts is a long game to complete as same as final fantasy.|`|ad48f304746f7c8f66bbf2748ba9742baa	Final Fantasy But Kingdom Hearts Is Also Great But It's Aimed Mainly More At Kids Even Though, I Enjoyed It|`|8qPjqXfQaa	I have never played final fantasy <br>  I have played Kingdom Hearts <br>  and its fun!|`|BRo9CTpaaa	It depends on what you like. Personally I like Kingdom Hearts beter because I like the battle system better but if you like turn based battle systems then you would like final fantasy better.|`|I0M6Llnbaa	Depends on the fantasy! FFVIII is my very favorite video game.I have played it through about 10 times over the years! And the music aint bad either.

It's been around longer and has better graphics.|`|gHblgGdPaa	FINAL FANTASY FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|kicEpMnzaa	Kingdom hearts because of the story line and the real time action.You have nice combos with awesome weapon and it has good graphics and action sceens.If you have the chance i would get kingdom hearts all the way|`|uKV89rM6aa	Hm... that's a hard one. I would say that Kingdom hearts is a better game, because it is fairly easy to play, has a good story line (with good graphics), and it also doesn't take forever to beat the game.It also has an attack system that is easy to use but still interesting and for those who like mini games, it has tons.<br>  Final Fantasy also has a good story line and stuff, but it takes FOREVER to beat (at least for me) and there are times when you begin to wonder, did the storyline run away? It also requires you to play Mini games, at least in some of them and since I personally hate mini games, that's annoying.<br>         There both great game series, and if you have the time and money, I would say get both, but if I have to choose it would be Kingdom Hearts.
wzRzdo22aa	I have RCT3, and it doesn't slow down my computer.  There's not a lot of lagging, but sometimes I get errors on my computer when I try to quit out.  I would recommend getting the game, because it's pretty neat.  I have no idea when RCT4 is coming out.  I didn't even know that they were going to make a fourth one.|`|b752fd6326ba18cebce3a336a9e16a09aa	i wouldnt have no idea, but i might be thinking of getting that game on my  windows"xp".|`|zbpSUk2yaa	its a great game but its has enough **** to make any computer/notebook slow down.

JVn52lmoaa	Halo 3 by far. Halo 2 was boring. Halo 2 wasn't even as good as Halo 1.|`|AA12141308	Halo 3....<br>  <br>  good weapons (better selections) and better equipment..<br>  and more challenging..(especially on live)|`|AVYFFRi2aa	halo 3 because there are more weapons, vehicles and the graphics are better|`|oN4wEYbAaa	idk why, but i like halo 2 better...|`|fxdlFZFuaa	i've got all halo's and they just got worse as time went on...halo 1 was great! halo 2 is ok but had a bad ending and Halo 3......i can't even find anything good to say about that game.|`|lNlL0Ag2aa	It depends on how long you played Halo 2. If you never played Halo 2, then Halo 3 is WAY better, but if you played Halo 2 for years (LIKE ME!!!) then you will easily get bored of Halo 3. Halo 3 is nothing more than an upgrade of Halo 2 with hyped up graphics, weapons, and items. Therefore, I don't recommend any Halo fan to buy Halo 3 because they will be REALLY disappointed about this overrated game.|`|aV2Kppp4aa	Halo 3 because it is not boring as Halo 2. Also the weapons are more lively and You can play with friends from around the globe.

And most games on the ps3 are out on the 360 except for medal gear and haze etc.|`|K8WqfJ86aa	Xbox has the better online service, more market share, and its easier for developers to make games for.
