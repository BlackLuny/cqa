20090225101226AAoI2fM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Help-potty training a three year old boy!?	My son will b ethree March 9th.  I have been trying to potty train him.  I just took away his diapers, no pull-ups, and I am taking him to his potty a lot.  But he rarely ever goes on his potty except first thing in the morning...all throughout the day I am cleaning up poop and pee.  He'll be playing and I will walk over to him and he'll be soaked or have a turd in his pants.  He acts as though he does not care.  I tried this technique (going straight to underwear) a few months ago and after one day of cleaning up pee all day I just decided he wasn't ready.  But he has to be by now, he is going to be three in less than two weeks.  He would tell me I needed to change his diaper after he went, and he holds his urine over night.  Is there a light at the end of this tunnel, or is him peeing on himself and continuing with his playing while sitting there in a mess a sign he is STILL not ready?  I have tried treats, etc.  What to do?

20090225101306AA50DrK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Just a couple questions about breast feeding...?	Hello.    My daughter is just about 9 weeks old & we STILL haven't mastered breast feeding. I've tried many positions.     With my first born, it was so easy! Why is she so difficult? Anyway, I would like tips &/or suggestions on how to make things go smoother.      Also, what are great snacks for me to munch on? As well as my 3 y/o. Sometimes I make large meals & freeze portions, but that's not always an option. If I'm really hungry late at night, I will make it a point to eat something healthy. Such as a bowl of wheat cereal.  Or an apple. Are meal replacement drinks ok? I figured it would be easier to chug one of those then to make a meal for my self.      Just to recap: What are some tips or techniques I can use to breast feed a lot easier?   What are some healthy snacks for my self, as well as my 3 y/o (he's picky)?   And, are meal replacement drinks fine for me? Do they have enough vitamins, etc. for a breast feeding mom?   Thank you for reading!!
20090225101258AAP6WOO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How long should I breastfeed my 6 month old daughter?	Ok first thing is I don't breastfeed, I pump ,but all she drinks is breast milk.  I pump her milk 4 to 6 time a day so I don't get that special bonding that you get to do when you're breast feeding :(.  Her dad gets to feed her in the morning while I pump.  I almost feel like I'm missing out on some things because I'm always pumping. The lactation nurses say 2 years is great and my doctor says 6 to 9 months if fine.  Any thoughts or suggestion?  Does any one know of a pumping support group or website?  I know kellymom and the like but no one really touches on mom's who strictly pump.      Side note:  She never took to breastfeeding, believe me we tried.
20090225101302AAEMoki	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Have any other mothers encountered a situation like this?	So here is the situation I am in.. I have a 5 month old son with a man that I have been with for over 3 years. The pregnancy was a complete shock but abortion is not for me so there was never even any discussion on having that as an option. My significant other has always enjoyed partying and drinking but I thought that when the baby came he would calm down. Instead, the complete opposite has occurred and he is now leaving because he claims that he is not ready to settle down and give up the partying lifestyle. Because we fight constantly over the drinking and him staying out until all hours of the night, I'm in complete support of him leaving because I don't want the stress and he is clearly not ready to change. (By the way, he is 25 years old, so it's not like he hasn't had his time to party over the past few years.) A few friends of mine dealt with situations like this and told me to hang in there and that he will wake up and realize what he is losing.. but I feel like he just keeps drifting further and further in the opposite direction. I'm in complete shock over this because when we first got together he was head over heels in love with me, the most considerate and sweetest man I had ever met. He works in an environment with a lot of college age kids and I feel like he envies their lifestyles. I'm just wondering if any other woman out there has gone through this and if so, is there anything that I can do... or how do I handle this situation? Thank you in advance for your advice.

I know that some babies are born on their due dates via scheduled c-section or by inducing, but what about naturally? I heard it was rare.       My beautiful little girl was born on 2/12/09 on the exact due date that the doctor stuck with during my entire pregnancy! She decided to come on her own at 2:28 AM that day and things happened so quickly that I wasn't allowed an epidural or any other pain meds. Quite a different experience compared to my first, let me tell ya. LOL She weighed 7 lbs. 9 oz. and measured 20 1/2 inches long.      Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone knew the statistics of babies being born naturally on their due dates?

20090227160848AAWi7sI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My brother forgets his keys a ton...?	So now when he forgets his keys I won't let him in until my dad gets home. Today he got home without his keys and I allowed him to stay there ringing the doorbell nonstop for a good 5-7 minutes. I figured since he and I are both 16, he can learn to bring his key. I have brought a key with me ever since I was like, 12. He is old enough to bring a key and remember. So I allowed him to wait outside. I figured I'd be nice today and let him in before dad gets home, and I asked him      "Did you learn your lesson?"   He said "No."   So next time I'll just have him wait until dad gets home, I'll turn my music on and ignore it.       We are both 16--I am three months older than him. He was adopted when he was 6 by us.          What do you think?   Would you do this or allow your son or daughter to do that if your other son or daughter didn't bring his keys?

But basically there's 3 levels of our team, there's the reallly good girls that play club and are mostly forwards/mids, and they're just amazing. then there's my level who can play well enough but aren't quite where they are, and then the people below us, who are basically benchwarmers :/    anyway, on monday it's our last game of the season (I think we've won 6 lost 2 tied 1? not sure) and it's against our schools boys team. Their team did just as well as ours during the season, and the other girls on my team are realllly excited to play them, but i'm just nervous!! I feel like if I get beat with the ball i'll just be embarrassed! my best friend on the team (she's amazing) was like whatever, you'll have fun and you can be as aggressive as you want, but I just feel like if I mess up i'll be like oh damn, I suck.   so basically, what i'm asking of you is some words of wisdom to make me feel less nervous or embarrassed?? lol thanks :]

Every time I try to take her outside she ends up putting things in her mouth or gets into things she shouldn't. She doesn't like to be pinned up, so a playard is out of the question. What can I do so she can play outside & I can work outside?

20090227161349AAC9pqQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is my sister pregnant?	My sister gets regular periods the 2nd of every month, her last period was JANUARY 2ND and she still hasnt got it. She took 3 pregnancy tests 1 a week after feb 2nd and 2 of them just last week and they ALL came out negative. She went to her GYN and both the urine and blood tests came out negative. She had a lot of stress in January which she could've delated her ovulation period which could make it too early to detect pregnancy, maybe? Could she be pregnant anyway?  I have a one month old and i had NO SYMPTOMS of pregnancy, neither did my mother so we cannot really go by that. What do you think? Have you gone through it?

20090227161446AAD8X0z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do you feel about friday nights?	Now that you're a parent, how do you feel about friday nights?      Every once in a while I get in a mood.  Probably one that is fueled by my youth.  And it's FRIDAY!!  Time to relieve stress, have a great time, and do friday stuff.  On those occasions we rent a children's movie and make popcorn.  Sometimes have a pizza "party."      But I just realized it was friday and it's 7:11 pm.  Now that I'm a parent (and especially because I'm a SAHM)  all my days seem to blend together.  When there are practices or special events for my kids those are the fun days.  Now FRIDAYS!!  are just fridays.      How about you?

I don't have a counselor in my school and the last time I talked about how I feel to a teacher, I cried. I'm still freaked out.       I don't want to talk to my friends anymore. I don't want to worry them much further. I don't want them to cut themselves just because of me. I can't talk to my parents either. They are already stressed out on a lot of things.      I want to reach out to someone yet I keep pushing people away. Everytime I try to say how I feel, I always end up crying like a five year old. But it hurts so bad. I just don't want to do something that I would regret.       I don't know what to do. I'm so exhausted I even pretended that I had a tummy ache so I won't have to go to school just so that I could cry on my bed the whole day. What's the point of going to school when you can't even concentrate because all that you want to do is cry?      I'll  try to talk to my teacher again on Monday but what should I say?      Thanks in advance.   ★

20090227153939AAXIBfK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What possible effects will having a father who keeps possible mother-figures away from a son have on him?	I live in a household with my single parent best friend, and his 3yr old son.      His son and I are extremely close. We spend 24hrs a day together.    I do more for/with him than his mother ever had - and for a longer time span than she had.      And now it has become obvious that his son does in fact think of me as his "mom" or something like it. He often tells me I am a mom, and so forth. He does not call me "mommy" or anything - just states the fact that he sees me as a Mom.      Now, his dad and I do have an intimate relationship. We had been friends prior to this developing, too. And as luck would have it, I now would like it if he would be "with" me and let me be a real mom for his child.   However, since the end of his last (and only) long term relationship, he's vowed off monogamous relationships.    When he talks of "their future" it's only them. It includes no one else.      Even despite the fact that he is VERY aware of how attached his kid is to me; and vice versa. And he even acts like we are in a relationship about 75% of the time, as a whole. We are more loving in every way in front of the kid than his parents ever were. To each other - and him.      With all that aside.....I wanted to know how this behavior might effect his son in the future.    -The fact that his biological mother left him.    -Then, the next person who came into his life and he thought off them as his mother figure; that because of his father's choices, she eventually becomes like his  real mother is to him- a voice on the phone.    -And so on and so forth - if each time he develops some intense female attachment and love, that they subsequently leave his life (for the most part), even if it's at his father's willing....will he view women differently?   Or will he have issues with the idea of a male/female relationship?   Would he have resentments toward his father? Or toward any of the women throughout his life?            Any of your thoughts would be appreciated.

20090227162348AAe3kxK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Thoughts on parent/child classes?	I've been a stay at home mom and a full time student online for a few months now...and its finally taking its toll. My daughter and I are always at home ...with nothing to do but play with toys..read books...and sing songs....and well....I don't know about you moms but I can't do that ALL day....it gets pretty boring...for myself and my daughter. I think she's starting to get really restless being cooped up at home all the time. And..I'm getting depressed just sitting at home not being able to do anything. When my daughter is awake she refuses to be left for even a few seconds so I can use the bathroom...so you can imagine..I can't do anything like dishes or housework. Also...its difficult to do anything when its her bedtime because she wants me to sleep with her. SOOO..yes I'm about to lose my mind...so I was thinking about taking some fun parent/child classes? My daughter is 10 mths old....and we live in the atlanta area...and I was wondering if anyone knew any great classes they liked.....like the gymboree classes? Advice anyone?

20090227154405AA1xOBs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	The importance of motion for young babies (0-6 mo)?	Hi,      I asked this question before, but almost all answers I got were unrelated to the question. Actually it's amazing how many people are jumping in to express their opinions w/out even bothering to read what you are asking. So, anyone who knows anything about the benefits of young baby motion, your answers would be appreciated:      Here is an excerpt from "Baby's First Year", by Sandy and Marcie Jones:      "Although your baby needs loving touches to get to know you, motion has been found to be even more effective than touch, your voice, interesting toys, or visual stimulation when it comes to helping him to calm down during a crying jag.      The vestibular system inside your baby's ears provides feedback to him about where his body is in space. Babies who don't move around and spend most of their time in cribs, play yards, walkers, and other baby-holding devices show poorer growth and slower body mastery than those who have been carried, rocked, and allowed plenty of floor freedom during their crawling and walking phases.      Unless your baby is in pain, hungry, or highly sensitive and easily overstimulated, using motion stimulation can usually cause him to stop crying, grow more alert, and focus on his environment. You can provide motion by rocking him; carrying him on your chest in a soft carrier; using an automatic baby swing (for short periods); gently moving him back & forth in a face-down position on an exercise ball; or by moving him up and down or side to side w your arms in wide arcs while you support his head and neck."      The book also advises against shaking the baby FYI.      SO, MY QUESTIONS ARE:   - does a baby buggie / pram / pushchair belong to the recommended ways to generate motion? I wonder why the book specifically recommends "carrying him on your chest in a soft carrier"   - does a baby rocker help? Or is it just the rocking in the arms?   - is the buggie comparable to the rocker, and it's just the lenght of time that matters, or is one of them better than the other?      Thanks

20090227160132AA53GPr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My baby daddy dont do anything for my child...hasnt since day 1 now he wants to take me to court?? lol?	What should I do? Every since he was born he never did anything for him....Well he did bring him some clothes even though they were hand me down, at least he did that and hes only given me ten dollars, but now he wants to take me to court, for visitation rights I guess Idk. His name isnt on the birth certificate and since Im on TEA he had to be put on child support, not my choice that was mandatory. So what should I do when he try to take me to court?
20090227155146AAIYxO4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Was I just called a whore?	this is the answer I got-   "At 28 you should have known better than to get knocked up by a boyfriend. If he's not your husband, he has no obligation to stay or support you. Also, I would question any man who thinks it's ok to be sleeping with a woman young enough to be his own daughter. You made your bed...      By the way, what insurance is paying for your healthcare cost? If it is any form of medicaid, you have no business having a baby. The rest of us work to put food on our tables, not yours and other irresponsible women who chose to make thier living on their backs.   Source(s):   Life..."      FYI-  I pay for my insurance.I work and go to school full time. Why would you think i get government aid?  Because I am brown? sounds racist to me. ppl like you make me sick. I asked for advice not your racism lady. So go back to you klan meeting or your trailer.      everyone else I am sorry but I can't stand racism. Nor can I stand ppl that try to put others down.

20090227155047AAIiePo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Am I being disrespectful or he is being overly jealous? I'm asking this on her behalf as she wrote it.?	My boyfriend who says trusts me very much so not to cheat on him says I'm being too flirty. For example, he invited me to go on a trip with him and "his" guy friends. We were at dinner that night with them and everyone was drinking and we were egging on a old woman in heat who was chasing (scaring) some of the guys we were with. I tried to get her to flash everyone (was told by the waitress that she has done this in the past) by demonstrating and lifting my shirt up. I only wanted to expose my abs but he said my bra was showing and granted, it probably did get exposed. Should that have bothered him? You should also know that I am a ring girl and am up on stage in a bikini (he does not have a problem with that). He also told me he would not have a problem with me doing this if it were in front of strangers. Also we were at a dinner party the other night with "my" friends. The host, my friend's husband (who has never crossed the line with me in the 8 years I have know him), comes up to me and motions that there is something on my chest and wanted to know if he could wipe it off for me....joking around of course....no big deal, he didn't touch me. Couple minutes later, I asked him the same thing and poked him in the chest. Then later, we are standing together and he comes by and backs up to us. So I proceeded to smack him on the butt a couple times (I do this to my women friends as well). Keep in mind, this guy usually is playful like this with my friends' other girlfriends but my boyfriend thinks he mainly seems to do it only with me. When we discussed it and he asked how I would feel if my friend did it to me in a flirty way, I said that I would have felt uncomfortable if he had smacked me on the butt with the intent of it being sexual but I know I did not have anything sexual behind the action of slapping him on the butt. These are just examples, there are more. Is my boyfriend being jealous and controlling or am I being disrespectful?       Little history about us....I was in an abusive/controlling relationship for 18 years and he was married for 15 years and his ex cheated on him.

20090227155601AAyTv5U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do you get through to a 8yr old!?	My son is in the third grade and is failing math and his science and social studies are now on heading in the failing direction. I have taken his tv, his video games, the only time he goes outside is when he is at school or in after school. I've given him extra math work to do at home and he always puts up a fight every time and whines like a 2yr old. When he is at school he doesn't do what he is suppose to, he doesn't write in his daily planner and if he does most of the time he doesn't write it all down. I am so upset by this and i don't know what to do anymore. How can i get through to him? Would holding him back in the 3rd grade and having him go through all this again be the right thing? I need some advice really bad!!!!

20090227161150AAG9Z1g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My friend commiited suicide, back in September ...?	I haven't cried for her yet. At all. Not even at her funeral, or her wake ... I didn't even cry when I found out about her. I know it's been a good while sense her death, but I can't come to terms with it. I want to cry because all I am feeling is overwhelming pangs of sorrow, but no tears ever arrive ! I've been thinking of her alot lately. I remember how innocent she was, and I remember the day she died. It's makes me feel bad, because there were sings of her vunrabelness and confusion. I feel part responsible for her doing it, because she had tried it before, but didn't succeed. Her parents didn't know about her first attempt, until she was gone, which make me feel part responsible also.       I want to ask, as witnessing the pain ... feeling that pain that which suicide causes, is it normal that I feel resentment towards my friend?    I feel angry towards her, but I still love her ... I'm very confused right now, and I can't contemplate it in my head, even after all this time.       Can someone please explain to me what I'm feeling & how I can cry ... how I can grieve, properly for my friend?   Thanks.

20090227172227AA5UVsL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How would a mother feel in this/what should she do?	How would a mother feel if her little girl about seven years old is taken against her mothers will to Germany, by her father?  She was born in American and has lives her first seven years in America.  A year later the German courts ruled that they are not required to send her back to America under Hague Convention.  This will hold up on appeal.  In Germany they say that is inhuman to send her to America (a horrible country to live in a diplomatic friendly manner) and away from her father.  She is living with her German father and has a better home than most American children have.  Her father takes good care of her, better than most American parents.  She has no trouble interrogating in Germany.  The father is not facing US federal charges, and the American FBI and German police will protect her from her American mother and State of Virginia.  The US embassy tells you the mother that you cant get a US passport for your daughter until she is 18.  The mother is informed that she can only have supervised visitations with her father (and regular phone calls) as long as you the mother agrees to recognize the German court order.  This means that you the mother has to drop all legal court action against in the State of Virginia.  This is what an international divorce lawyer will tell you.         The little girl informers you that she wants to live with her father in Germany and considers her a German national, not an American.  Because she is raised properly she still wants her mother to visit her regular as long as she is assured that you will not take her away from her a German father.  She is not brain washed.

20090227174344AASQaEl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	U/S question...follow on to last question with more detail?	I asked this question earlier but I wanted to ask again because I wasn't very detained in my last. I tried to get my U/S picture bigger but I am bad with computers and don't know how to fix it. Anyway, today I went in for my U/S and I originally thought I was 8 weeks counting from my last LMP which started the 3rd of Jan. the thing is: my LMP lasted for 10 days and the first four days were light spotting. Then the rest of the time normal bleeding for a period. It ended around the 14-15 of Jan. Well, I had sex on the 21st and 25th of Jan (I believe personally I conceived on the 25th because I had really fertile CM that day) and I also had sex on the 6th of Feb with my BF. Then on the 11th of Feb I got a positive on my HPT. Well, since the 6th, after we had sex, I started spotting until three days ago. I was worried thinking I was having a miscarriage. It was not heavy or anything like that. I told the lady who did my U/S and she said that there are a number of reasons why one would spot but didn't really tell me much more. She didn't seem too concerned. She said during my U/S that there wasn't a heartbeat and he measured my sac and I think if I remember correctly it measured 3 mm. She didn't say anything about the fetal pole or anything but I looked at my U/S pic and it looks like there is a little bean thing inside the sac. Is that normal? Also, does this make sense with the dates I had sex...does that correspond with the age of my pregnancy? I don't think I have a 28 day cycle btw. I lost track of counting the days but I think I had a weird cycle the cycle I got pregnant. Anyone have any insight?

It's a great idea, but I'm so freaking tired.  I have been so tired and drained I can only manage to work out on Saturday and Sunday...the two days I can get a good 10-12 hours of sleep!  If I don't get at least 9 hours of sleep, which I can't on the weekdays, I barely drag myself through the day.      So people, what is your experience with exercise and being pregnant? Do you think it's horribly bad to only work out 2 days a week?  (and when I say work out, I mean walk on the treadmill and thats about it)

I will most likely take him because they recommend it. Oh and he has no teeth yet. ( but he does drool like crazy!)

I'm a stay at home mom to a 3 year old boy so having this little girl come over and play with my son is a wonderful thing for my son. However, when I told a friend that his friend was over my house on a Friday night at 7:30pm she said "do her parents care about her?" "it's late why isn't she at her own home?"   These comments bother me cuz I don't understand why my 3 year old can't have friends over the house and sleepovers. The little girl has slept over sometimes but that was mostly babysitting to help her mother.   What's your opinion? Do her parents' care about her? Is it normal for her to be over my home at 7:30pm?

20090227162958AAsJ1uP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Early Pregnancy Symptoms?	I took an ovulation test on 2-13 which showed positive for an LH surge.  On 2-23 I began feeling light cramps.  On 2-25 I started to have heavy and sore breasts.  On 2-26 I noticed creamy light pink discharge (really light) and had a nagging headache.  Today I noticed the discharge was gone. Its now 2-27 and I now feel a nagging nausea that only goes away when I eat a little something and still have a headache.  I am still feeling crampy.  I have had gas and heart burn for about a week.  My cervix is high and softish but not as soft as ovulation.        I took a test today but it was negative.  Maybe I am just getting sick, but we are trying to conceive and I hope I am preggers.  My questions is... How long after I detected the surge would I have ovulated and would it have been too late to have be seeing implantation bleeding?  What does everyone think? How much longer should I wait to test again or is it even worth it?
20090227163142AAFPaeM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why is this happening to me?	I know freshman year of high school is hard, but I didn't know it would be this bad.      I went to a small school for 8 years, and am in a small school with 175 freshmen.  7 kids from my 8th grade class (out of the 15 kids in my 8th grade) went to my school, and they all barely talk to me anymore.  One kind of does, one is following me around and driving me insane with her late night calls about her wanting to commit suicide, and the rest are either too cool to talk to me, or downright ignoring me.      I am so mad because my new classmates whom don't even know me are spreading all these nasty rumors.  There have been two pregnancy rumors (Which are false), drug rumors (false again), dating rumors (false, never dated), and so many others, and I have lost longtime friends, and failed to make new ones.       I am so sick of going to school every day to face what seems like perpetual harassment.  Kids throw stuff at me, tease me, start rumors about me, touch me, call me at night with prank calls, DRIVE PAST MY FRIGGIN HOUSE AT MIDNIGHT AND HONK THIER HORN FOR TWO FRIGGIN MINUTES, and I am so sick of it.       I am sick of feeling unmotivated, depressed, and lonely.      I am considering switching schools next year, and I am registering at both schools and just dropping out of the one I'm not going to.

In early december i had an abortion (i have circumstances as to why this was the best descision please do not leave hate messages), and an IUS fitted the same day. i know in rare circumstances pregnancy with an IUS can be etopic???      Please someone shed some light i'm fed up of being in agony and not knowing why.
20090227164530AAK4S9A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Had sex mulitiple times, can i be pregnant?	First of all, i know im stupid, got that much, because you should never have sex unless you are prepared for the consequences. I am prepared for them but my mother will not be.      I had my period on the first of January, it usually comes the first of every month no matter what. About a week later my boyfriend and i had sex, he pulled out, and had urinated soon before hand. This happened, urination too, again the following week. Just last week we had protected sex because he finally got a condom. He promises me that he would know if i was, but that doesnt stop me from worrying. My mom is a very violent person, and i am scared for my life. I do not want advice about my mother, just chances of pregnancy, thankyou

20090227170526AAA8aWU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could i possible be pregnant?	My boyfriend has been fingering me (i have not had sex), and about a week ago after he fingered me when i went to the restroom there was a little bit of brownish discharge but it did not happen again.  My period should have started around this time but it has not come.  I've had swollen breasts, and about two days ago i had cramps and thought i was going to start my period soon, which doesn't seem to be the case.  I've also been experiencing nausea, but i've also been really stressed out and i have acid reflux which gets worse when my stress level rises.  I know that it's impossible to get pregnant from just fingering, but what if my boyfriend had touched himself before (i know he did not masturbate, but what if there was pre-***?)?  Was the brownish discharge implantation bleeding or caused by him being too rough (which i would think would cause there to be blood, not brownish discharge personally...)?  I'm freaking out about this which i know could affect my period as well.

20090227172422AAeN4Gv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What could this mean. I keep bleeding?	Okay so a while ago about 6 months ago i started a new birth control (TriSprintec) and everything was fine. Well about 3 months ago when i started a new pack I noticed that my period never completely went away its was like i bleed just a little the whole month it was very dark brownish thick blood (sorry if im grossing you out). It did it the whole time until i started a new pack the next month. When i started the new one every thing went back to normal the bleeding stopped and i was fine. Well once i finished that pack and started the next pack (the one I am getting ready to finish in a few days) the same symptoms came back except it worked at first. I stopped bleeding after my period like normal but the dark thick light bleeding came back on about the 2nd week of the pack and has not stopped yet. So does any one know what could be causing this?? i am so clueless on this.. thanks so much for your help.
20090227173347AApFRcY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	If you had an unintentional pregnancy, would open records make you choose abortion rather than adoption?	Let's make the assumption that the pregnancy was not caused by rape or incest, and that there was no way you could parent the child.  This is specifically about open records - allowing your child to find you 18 years later - is that a good thing or a bad thing?  Extra points for those who have actually MADE the decision.
20090429185635AABZKRi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do I punish my son for bad grades?	My13 year old son is currently running track and mid way through his season. I just received his report card and he has two D's on it. The rule in the house is, if you get lower than a C you cant compete in sports during school. My dilemma is what to really do? He is having a tough year with math and writing and after talking to him I have discovered that his study habits are lacking greatly. His older brother is getting ready to go to college and I had this problem with him before and he was unable to run track his 8th grade year. Now he is a state qualifying cross country and track runner getting picked up on a full ride this fall. My youngest is quite and emotional young man compared to my oldest and wears his emotions and feelings on his sleeve.   I am torn on what to do. Suggestions or alternatives would be great. Even at 40 I have a lot to learn at being a parent.   My youngest plans on running cross country in the fall and on to basketball this winter. Want him to be his best for himself.   Open for advice.

20090225103444AAkb5mU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I need some advice, confused?!?	On February 15, I had protected sex with my boyfriend. After he ejaculated, the condom got stuck inside me. He noticed right after obviously and managed to get it out with his fingers (Sorry for TMI). We are not sure if any semen got inside me at all because we saw semen inside the condom. When I went to the bathroom, I wiped and there was tons of white/clear on the t.p. I'm not sure if it was all of the lube, me, or the semen. Then later on that day, I felt a lot of stuff come out of me and I went to the bathroom and there was tons of white(SORRY!). I'm not sure what it was exactly though. I probably sound dumb, sorry. I checked my ovulation calender and it says my most fertile day is the 16th or 17th. So I ovulated that whole week.   -3 days ago I had slight slight period cramps.   -2 days ago I went to the bathroom and wiped and there was light light brown and at the end of the day I checked my underwear and there was a tiny amount of brown but I haven't had the cramps or brown since.   -Period is due about March 3rd.   -I have had sex other times besides that day too.   -Condom was NOT spermicidal         Do you think that was implantation bleeding? Has anyone you know or you gotten pregnant from the condom getting stuck inside? What colour/when does implantation occur? Any additional advice would help, thanks!

20090225103424AA6NwfI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why do some people think breastfeeding is disgusting?	I breastfeed my son for 18 months. I really wanted to make it to two years which is now the recomendation but he weened himself so that was fine. I don't understand why this bothers people. I used to get rude comments all of the time like that I am doing it for my own sexual pleasure. What kind of comment is that? The comments got worse as my son grew closer to a year old and I just don't understand what is wrong with people. It is only by people who never even did it so what do they know and where are they getting their information from? I know that often times it was painful especially when they get teeth or your nipples get chapped or cracked. I just want to try to understand why some people like to make crazy and disgusting assumptions about something that is natural and so beneficial to the child especially when they weren't even willing to try it and obviously didn't even research it.

20070617083138AA3XvcA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Desideri e dubbi...............?	Ciao a tutti! Sono una ragazza di 19 anni e sto con il mio ragazzo, che ha 21 anni, da 7 mesi!! Io sono vergine. Lui mi ha chiesto di fare l'amore, dandomi ovviamente tempo, rispettandomi, e non dandomi fretta! L'altra sera ne parlammo e lui disse cosa fosse che mi frena, se fosse lui che non mi da sicurezza! Ma non è affatto così, ci sono state diverse occasioni che lui, per primo, si fermava quando sentiva che stava per perdere le staffe! Io gli dissi che come ogni ragazza ho i miei dubbi, le mie paure... e poi il mio desiderio è di farlo solo con una persona nella mia vita! Ovviamente questo non è possibile saperlo... voi che pensate? Cmq ad essere sincera viene anche a me il desiderio di poterlo amare in tutti i sensi... per me la verginità è un valore importantissimo!! Spero di condividerlo con lui, SOLO!!!

Ma il problema nn é la differenza di età.Lui fa il promoter nei negizi di telefonia e capite bene ke si tratta di un lavoro occasionale. Ne abbiamo parlato e gli ho spiegato ke nn può continuare così perké ha ormai 30 anni e il mondo del lavoro già difficile di per sé, di questo passo lo lascerà fuori. Gli ho detto di svegliarsi, di darsi un'okkiata in giro, di cercare e non di stare a casa quasi tutta la settimana e  dormire fino alle 13 tutti i giorni!Io da un ragazzo della sua età mi aspettavo più maturità. Dice ke nn ha intenzione di fare un lavoro in ufficio solo per avere uno stipendio fisso perké tanto lui deve pensare solo a sé, nn ha responsabilità di nessuno, nn ha famiglia, né figli. mi accusa di volerlo cambiare ma ke se voglio restare con lui devo accettare ke resterà così e per di più ha detto ke se andassi a vivere lì da lui allora troverebbe un lavoro migliore.Per di più...

20070705071633AAZyljp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Le k è il linguaggio di internet?	Una domanda (forse da vecchia ma in fondo ho solo 26 anni)   Premetto che non mi piaccioo le abbreviazioni se non negli sms dove servono a risparmiare o in chat per essere veloci alcune le posso anche capire ma a altre cose non ci arrivo.      Tipo:   capisco la k al posto della ch ma perchè usare così spesso la k al posto della C? Che ha di male la C.   Non è che la k sia più moderna.      Perchè in uno spazio come questo spesso eliminare quasi tutte le vocali, fretta non ce n'è e a volte alcuni post mi risultano difficili da capire.      In generale non dico che si debbano usare perfettamente tutte le forme verbali ecc (anche se è una bella cosa)      Ma abbiamo una bellissima lingua è un peccato deturparla.      e comunque la c è simpatica non sostituistela con delle dure k dai ;)

It looks horribly messy, and I'd like to have my old entertainment unit "look" back so I'm not so apprehensive about inviting guests over.      I'd prefer no thin tall cabinets that might easily fall over. I'd also like for us to easily be able to get at the movies and games. It's getting difficult at the moment.      I have a two year old, and a 9 month old. Thanks!

20090225102809AALFiyY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	If I reduce breastfeeding to 3 times a day, should I be able to maintain my milk supply?	Hello   Currently I breastfeed 4-5 times a day. I have 12-months old chubby boy. We both enjoy breastfeeding which is now more for the emotional benefits of it than Medical requirement. I wouldn't like to wean him, but I do want to reduce the number of feeding to 3 a day. He doesn't breastfeed at night (he stopped several months ago).   Do you think 3 times will be enough to maintain my milk supply? I had some drops in milk supply, but succeed to increase it due to pumping and supplements.   P.S. He has also 3 solid meals a day

Premetto che non sono né una bacchettona né una moralista, ma, gironzolando su answer, mi sono accorta che ci sono tante ragazzine di 14, 15 o 16 anni che fanno tranquillamente sesso col proprio ragazzo (e, fin qui, niente di male). Il problema è che queste ragazze, che, visti i tempi, dovrebbero essere molto informate, non hanno idea di cosa siano i metodi anticoncezionali e poi stanno qui a chiedere se sono incinte! Inoltre, buona parte di loro, se scopre di essere incinta, decide di abortire. Ma l'aborto è diventato un metodo anticoncezionale? E la scuola e i genitori che dovrebbero dare un'educazione sessuale ai ragazzi, dove sono?

My husband and I have been together for 3 years, and he is aware of what I want, but would like to wait until I'm closer to 40.  I am so worried about this, esp. since I would like to consider having a second child someday and he doesn't seem interested in the idea of adopting.        To make matters worse, I told him this was frustrating me so much that I wanted to go off standard birth control, which we agreed to.  We have been using protection (for the most part), but there was one day in particular where we both decided to take a chance...and I think it may have resulted in more than he bargained for.  I have a doctor's appointment soon to find out conclusively...      Trying to cope with wanting a baby has been so emotionally distressing for me, and lately for him too (since I've been such a wreck), that I am worried about hurting our marriage.  I love my husband dearly and know that he will be a fabulous father when he is ready...but am so concerned that if we wait too long, the emotional damage may be extensive.  At the same time, creating a life that is only half-wanted is not something I wish to do, and the health of our marriage is the most important thing of all to me...

Hi I've just got a new job at a playschool and I was asked to do Circle time last week for my first time... it didn't go so well... I don't know too many kids songs off by heart so I had cue cards with the words on them and I had no idea what else to do so I just sang songs one after the other and after about 2 songs the kids completely lost interest and were running around and shouting... a few of them still paid attention.  Another problem is that there is a special needs kid in the class and I was told to stay seated for circle time and keep him on my lap... so that also limits what I can do with the rest of the kids as we cant really stand up and play games like simon says and such... the kids are around 2 years old.  If anyone has any ideas of different kinds of things I can do to keep their attention and keep them seated that would be great!! please help! I work again tomorrow.... :|  thank you!!

20070705064756AA6t5Er	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	E' possibile avere la nausea insieme alle mestruazioni??	La mia ragazza nella giornata di ieri ha avvertito un senso di nausea-vomito con il presentarsi delle mestruazioni...ci sarà stato massimo un giorno - un giorno e mezzo di ritardo ma è successo anche altre volte (anche più giorni) il fatto è che lei soffre normalmente di fitte all'addome ma nausea non è ha mai avvertita. Succede sempre che nei giorni precedenti il ciclo lei avverta dei dolori alla pancia che poi scompaiono con l'inizio delle mestruazioni, questa volta però è andata a mare proprio nei giorni in cui dovevano arrivare. So che quando si va a mare o in piscina il flusso diminuisce e rallenta. Può essere questa la causa di nausea o devo preoccuparmi?? Mi sembra strano debba preoccuparmi dal momento che il ciclo è arrivato normalmente, però c'è questo senso di nausea che mi affligge...

I try to have sex as much as possible to keep my chances of getting pregnant better. I had my period on Feb 3. According to the ovulation calculator i ovulated on the 14th. Which i dont think i did b/c no white stuff came. I have unprotected sex a few times a week. So my question is how do i know if ill ever be able to get pregnant?

My OBGYN says that i am normal (my tests and everything) and that was in October so i cant imagine anything changing since then.
