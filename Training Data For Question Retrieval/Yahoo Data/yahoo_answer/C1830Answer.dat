xm7Cv0rgaa	it is not good to leave your battery on charge for long periods of time. and yes it is running off the adaptor|`|pA8lfKbJaa	That is correct, although in rare instances, you will see the light turn orange for a while, meaning the battery is being charged a bit.  This may be a calibration issue if it occurs.  Be sure to follow the instructions in the Getting Started booklet or the online Help on Calibrating the Battery.

hMPhj66Aaa	Adobe Photoshop is the best program for what you want. However, it will run you 400 dollars unless you are a student. There are two other solutions that you can consider however. The first is Photoshop Elements, which is a less feature filled version that runs for around 80 dollars. This is probably the second best option for what you are doing, and will most likely function exactly the same until you get into really advanced stuff. The second alternative is a free program called GIMP. This is an open source program that is mostly on par with Elements. The UI is less refined however, and there are somewhat less features. I would suggest downloading GIMP first, to see if it can accomplish what you need, then decide from there if it cant do what you need.|`|WuWJ23claa	Okai im just learning about this kind of stuff so:<br>  Yes photoshop would be your best bet for the changeing of the image BUT if you are looking for something with colour editing and cutting, cropping images get fireworks 8 / CS4.<br>  <br>  Also an extra piece of software paint shop pro i am not realy sure what this is capable of doing but I have seen basic elements of the software.<br>  <br>  Try searching these ideas on google and see what you think yourself!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	The advent of the microcomputer and digital photography has led to the rise of digital prints.

vAIWT1yvaa	all in all, you have 250 gigs of memory<br>  <br>  but you have only 107 gigs of free space. the resta re already used by ur saved programs and files.<br>  <br>  the 2 gigs u see there a re called the ram<br>  <br>  that is different. ram memory, basically, meansthe amount of memory u can procces at a time|`|VgIBEANxaa	The 2GB is your RAM.  That's the memory your computer uses while it is running.  The 250GB is your hard drive.  That's the space you have for mass storage.  There are several reasons why your 250GB hard drive is only showing up as 107GB.  One is because the 250GB they advertise is in decimal, and since the computer uses binary it sees it as 232GB.  Of that 232GB, a lot of it is used to store your operating system and anything else you have on your computer.  The drive also might be partitioned, meaning even though there is physically one drive, the computer sees it as two.  So your one 232GB hard drive might appear as two 116GB hard drives.  If this is the case, you can use either partition for storage.|`|0wUwKbHsaa	RAM is where your computer does the work. RAM stores things temporarily. The hard drive is is where you store information permanently.  Every time you go to use something, it is taken from the hard drive and stored into RAM temporarily (this is why if you do not save something and turn the computer off you lose your work).<br>  <br>  You can see how much storage space you have by going to My Computer and looking at the properties of your hard drive.

ldJXd0NGaa	First thing to do is reinstall your sound drivers. Go to Start, run, and type<br>  DEVMGMT.msc.  This will open Device Manager. <br>  Click the category for  Sound. <br>  Right-click your sound card - (not the Legacy ones, or the codecs) - it will have a brand name like Realtek or Soundblaster. Choose Uninstall or Remove from the popup menu.  Then reboot.<br>  As the PC reboots you'll see a message like "Windows has found new hardware and will install the drivers for it".  Wait until you see a message like "your new hardware is ready to use".  <br>  That should fix your problem - at least the part where you can't adjust the volume sliders.<br>  As for the mic, be sure it is plugged into the "mic" jack, and be sure it is plugged in securely (doesn't wiggle around).<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Donk

AA11434745	You can't. You can only get that information from Flash itself.
VgIBEANxaa	Technically, all of those sites are legit, and you can get a laptop, but nothing is free.<br>  <br>  What they really do is tell you that you have to go spend so much money at so many other places and then once you've met the spending requirements you get your free laptop, or XBox, or whatever they're trying to dangle in front of you to get you to spend money.  I guess it's ok if you're the type of person that would go spend money at those places anyway, but most of it is probably a rip off and they're probably not even offering good laptops.  Go spend your money on the laptop of your choice instead.|`|R8mm8eHPaa	search for the sitename and scam on google. For ex. search for "www.notebooks4free.com scam", without quotes in google to see if the site is scam or not.|`|XlyLakYAaa	All of them are scams.  You cannot get something for nothing.|`|YESUhp8gaa	Some may nor be scam according to that website. IF this offer is legit, you need to refer products to atleast 18 to 24 different people to get the product.
AA10112700	Yes, that is perfectly normal. The more intensive your usage, the hotter the components get – and the faster the fans have to run.<br>  <br>  Most laptops have a power management utility that allows you to turn on something to the effect of “Silent Mode”, where your CPU is underclocked to prevent it from getting hot enough that the fan has to speed up. However, that will impede your computer’s performance.|`|AfADK4wBaa	Yes, I think this is normal. When the computer is running for a while or loading something big, like a movie or song, its fan usually increases so the computer won't get too hot while its loading. I'm not 100% sure, so you might want to call best buy just to make sure.|`|EUyXOwuZaa	playing games or watching a long movie heats up the computer because its processing a lot of data. The fans are there to cool it off. If you fans didn't do that it would over heat. You'll also notice they run more in the summer than in the winter, because of the temp.
zTuc5eDIaa	Download the sound drivers from the manufacturer's website, such as HP, Dell, or whatever your computer brand is. Go to the support section where you can choose your model and download the appropriate drivers.<br>  <br>  I know this may sound stupid, but also make sure your speakers are turned on and plugged in to the computer.|`|2RQ4qDhXaa	Speakers may be toast. Try pluging in headphones that you know work. If you get sound, your speakers are dead. If you don't, you may have either a sound card driver problem, or the cound card itself might be burnt up.<br>  <br>  I'll bet it's the speakers, though. That's the most common.
Pj2EqQbDaa	This is actually a system thing before you log on into an account. <br>  In order to pul this off, you would have to find programs like Tweak XP 4 to fuss with the performance and make the welcome screen show up faster. <br>  <br>  Hardware-wise, get a faster Processor, typically 2.5gig, and a gig of memory and call it a night.|`|ygELhfO6aa	You can't; it's loading.|`|b8a082ae9c8de91d49bab7e394908eb1aa	This screen displays while your system is loading.  The only way to shorten the length of time that it is displayed for would be to remove unused programmes from your system using the uninstall option, or via the Windows control panel.<br>  <br>  You could also try using Windows cleaner type software to remove unneccesary files loaded during start up safely.  I can recommend Advanced System Care.  It is a good programme which can be used for free, and I have included a link for a download and decription.|`|0f53624e253ff98b5745955d48febbc0aa	You can go into msconfig and kill some of the unnecessary boot services. Type msconfig into Run and hit Enter. Go to start up and uncheck any unnecessary processes. Make sure to know what they are before killing them.
xgRbiMU5aa	You can't format it in FAT16, as FAT16 has a 2GB limit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#Final_FAT16" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Alloca...</a><br>  <br>  The only way to format it in FAT16, would be to break it into  about 750 2GB partitions.<br>  <br>  Id like to see you try to do that.|`|XlyLakYAaa	If you convert it to FAT16, it'll only be a 2GB hard drive... perhaps you could have 750 partitions....<br>  <br>  You'd need to use a legacy OS like MS-DOS, Windows 95, etc to format FAT16.|`|PrGwiL76aa	Plain and simple, FAT16 cannot handle 1.5 TB, the maximum is about 4 Gb partition on FAT16.<br>  <br>  So like the other guy, you can have hundreds of partitions in that harddrive but it is not advisable because its not as safe and stable as FAT32 or NTFS
NZxvybYUaa	In VERY simple terms, maximum packet size (MTU or Maximum Transmission Unit) can affect speed of transmission by reducing packet errors. Data is transferred in blocks, or packets, usually of uniform size. If the MTU is too large, sometimes the header of the next packet will try to fit into the leading packet, causing an error and requiring a re-transmission of the packet. Fiddling with this can sometimes help and sometimes create great big problems. Those numbers sound reasonable, but I'd be sure to write down the beginning settings, in case I needed to go back.
sjP1IDILaa	Yes, there should be a counter on the bottom of the page that shows how many people have visited it.  Also, in My Ebay, under Selling, there is a list of the items you have for sale.  One of the columns shows you how many people have put the item on their "watch" list.
vAIWT1yvaa	it means the ram available is not enough to run photoshop.<br>  <br>  760 should be enough, but maybe u are running too many programs|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Question: How do I Save a Photoshop File for an Older Version?<br>  ( Source = <a href="http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/photoshop/f/backwardcomp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/photosh...</a> )<br>  <br>  <br>  My answer relates to backward compatibility when opening files from any newer version of Photoshop using any older version of Photoshop.<br>  <br>  Answer: There is an option in Photoshop preferences called "Maximize PSD File Compatibility" (under menu Edit > Preferences > File Handling). You will want to make sure this is set to "Always" or "Ask." Turning this option on, however, does result in larger file sizes. If you only need this feature occasionally, you can set it to "Ask" and Photoshop will ask you if you want to maximize compatibility every time you save a file. When this option is used, the layers are saved along with a flattened composite of the image. <br>  <br>  Still, when you open a newer version file in older version, the new features of Photoshop will not carry over when the file is opened in an older version that did not contain these features. If the file is edited and saved from the older version, the unsupported features are discarded. <br>  <br>  For instance, there are some new blending modes that were added since Photoshop 6 came out. If you used any of these in your file and then edit it in the older version, the image may look different. Other new features like smart objects, certain effect layers, layer sets or groups, layer comps, etc. won't carry over. You might want to make a duplicate of your file and simplify it as much as possible before trying to open it in an older version. <br>  <br>  The same applies when opening Photoshop files in other non-Adobe software that reads PSD files.|`|XlyLakYAaa	You saved the file in CS4 format.  You need to save it as a Photoshop 6.0 file, as Photoshop 6.0 cannot open CS4 files.|`|gjweuOcVaa	760 MB is pretty low for Adobe Photoshop. You will be down to about a little bit above 512MB just for having Windows XP up even if you have no other running programs. If you have a bunch of running programs, that number might obviously be much lower.<br>  <br>  EDIT: NVM, I didn't understand the whole question.

M2PDDtHqaa	Tumblr.com's awesome for putting up a basic website, and really easily adding photos, links, videos, written stuff etc, and the whole thing can customised/written with HTML & CSS, or you can use of the themes provided.

Within hours of its release, Microsoft's Service Pack 3 for Windows XP began drawing hundreds of complaints from users who claim the update is wreaking havoc on their PCs.   The problems with XP SP3, according to posters on Microsoft's Windows XP message board, range from spontaneous reboots to outright system crashes.       IBM Chairman Emeritus Irving Wladawsky-Berger talks about cloud as the next evolution in computing, saying that it's a response to end-user frustration with complexity. "My external disks are having trouble starting up, which results in Windows not starting up," complained user Michael Faklis, in a post Wednesday. "After three attempts [to install XP SP3] with different configurations each time, System Restore was the only way to get me out of deep s**t," said 'Doug W'.   Another user said the service pack prevented him from starting his computer. "I downloaded and installed Windows XP Service Pack 3 Network Installation Package for IT Professionals," wrote 'Paul'. "Now I can't get the computer to boot."     Dozens of other posters reported similar problems.     It's not uncommon for major operating system updates to cause problems. Typically, the glitches are due to conflicts with software, such as drivers, system files, or applications already resident on the user's PC. Microsoft has yet to indicate whether it will issue an update to address some of the problems, though it has done so with previous updates.     Microsoft released Windows XP SP3 to broad distribution on Wednesday. It's available from Microsoft's automated Windows Update service or as a file that can be pulled from the Download Center on the company's Web site.     The service pack should offer a number of enhancements over the current version of the OS, which Microsoft is phasing out after June 30th. It includes all updates issued since Windows XP Service Pack 2 was released in 2004, and some new elements.     Among them: A feature called Network Access Protection that's borrowed from the newer Windows Vista operating system. NAP automatically validates a computer's health, ensuring that it's free of bugs and viruses before allowing it access to a network.     Windows XP SP3 also includes improved "black hole" router detection -- a feature that automatically detects routers that are silently discarding packets. In XP SP3, the feature is turned on by default, according to Microsoft.     Additionally, Windows XP SP3 steals a page from Vista's product activation model, meaning that product keys for each copy of the operating system don't need to be entered during setup. The feature should prove popular with corporate IT managers, who often need to oversee hundreds or thousands of operating system installations.     Some users may balk at a feature in XP SP3 that prevents them from downgrading their browser from Internet Explorer 7 to the older IE 6 once the service pack has been installed. XP SP3 also won't install on systems running beta versions of the yet-to-be released IE 8.     Microsoft said the restrictions are designed to prevent system instabilities.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	1) You'll probably have to reactivate Windows - you may have to call Microsoft to do that.    2) You burn an iso file by telling your burning software to burn an iso, or burn an image, depending on the software.

Run virus scans with a trusted anti-virus program as well as an anti-spyware program.  Assuming you have no hardware issues, do this:    (1) Run a FULL anti-virus scan with a good virus scanner. Get free editions of AVast or Antivir. Use the latest virus definitions file. But don't install or run more than one anti-virus at the same time.    (2) Run anti-spyware scans with Spybot S&D and malwarebytes.    (3) Ensure all Microsoft security updates are applied.    (4) Run disk cleanup to delete old temp files and other junk    (5a) Run chkdsk once to scan for file system errors. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265    (5b) Run  a thorough disk defrag. Use a good defragmenter for this, and also run a boot-time defrag to fix the MFT and page file if they are fragmented. You can check out Diskeeper 2009, which is widely acknowledged to be the best defragger around. Their website has free 30-day trial versions. http://www.diskeeper.com    (6) Disable unnecessary background processes and services that take up memory.    (7) Make sure all the hardware components have the latest and most stable drivers. Video card performance in particular is strongly dependent on drivers.

8ca8be7f4582c735baa8ec960d2230c0aa	I don't think you can use a laptop on a plane. There are laws governing this. Like another answerer said, ask your airline about it.    However, once you get to your destination (in Mexico) there should be public UNsecured hot spots that you can connect to. It depends upon exactly where you will be at any given moment just like anywhere else. While using those hot spots you will have to be VERY careful NOT to use any sites that require that you input personal info. There are key-logging programs out there that nefarious parties use to steal your personal info with. Therefore, you don't want to access your banking site, for instance. You'll want to continue to change passwords on other sites such as here in Yahoo, etc on a regular basis while out to help put a stop to the nefarious use of them should you be caught by one of these key-loggers.    In addition, when you cross the border, your laptop WILL be searched for any illegal files. If any illegal files are found you will be in trouble with the FEDS _BIG TIME!!!_ ...doesn't matter HOW they got there. Is that a chance you WANT to take???

Those can be expected to run hotter and, they come with fans that tend to generate a lot of noise.      Few laptops use graphics cards - using instead weaker but more economical integrated graphics.  The advantages of these systems is lower system heat (with the collateral advantages of fewer shutdowns and other heat-related problems), less bulk, longer battery time and lower cost.  I also suspect (no evidence to back this up) that these systems actually have shorter service lives.

I thought Id just pop in and drop off some links and info that might be able to help you out.    First, this problem more-than likely doesnt have to do with your OS. Second, do you know the model of your laptop? That could help me pinpoint some ways to troubleshoot your problem a little better.    Like Diana B said, airflow around a laptop is key to optimal performance. Laptops, because they are built so compactly rely on the airflow around them to create enough dissipation. If youre using your laptop say in bed, or on the couch, or on your lap a lot the computer can lose a lot of its ability to cool.     If youre looking for a laptop cooling pad you can go many different directions. Heres a quick link to some at Office Depot. Im not endorsing them in any way, but its a jumping-off point for your search: http://www.officedepot.com/a/browse/note... From what I found they range anywhere from $15 (for non fan unit) up to $50 or $60 (units with powered fans).    Good luck! If you do come back with your model number, I might be able to pull some more-specific information for you.

dfjIBHe3aa	Is your compiler case insensitive?  I'm used to doing them in blocks of     begin  begin  end;  end.    But what do I know?  I use Linux.    As Ruby says in:    http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/P...    For variable := fromwhat to what do  begin    :    :    statements / commands    :    :  end;    Example : Suppose i is an integer    For i:=1 to 5 do  begin    writeln(i);    if i=5 then writeln('Finished !');  end;    It yields 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then the message 'Finished !'. You see that inside the begin-end block, you could add any commands you want. If there is only one command inside it, you may omit the begin..end, just like if we have studied before. Suppose you omit the if i=5 ..., so inside the begin..end we have only writeln(i);. We can omit the begin..end, then it becomes :
s520iAXXaa	Short answer: No.    An insufficient power-supply cannot slow your frame/second.    The reason for this is that if your video-card/CPU has a particular demand for power and that demand cannot be supplied then it will literally cease to function (your computer will suddenly shut down).    There is no way your video card or CPU can "communicate" with the PSU as if to say, "Give me this 100 watts" "I can't give you that much but you can have 50 watts.", "fine."    It just doesn't work like that.|`|34yKqNaQaa	I bet its majorly fragmented.  Try defragging, Diskeeper is a great product for this.

Ohxue95Jaa	u have to download it in order to watch it|`|W9PSxtXFaa	youtube.com
k7byuIUNaa	Wow..... a lot of questions to answer.... well i have used both of these operating systems. i have used windows 98,millenium,xp,vista, even windows 7, mac and fedora ( linux ) and ubuntu ( linux ) . what iam remaining with was the red hat linux :)...each one has its own importance. Let me explain about each of the operating system and its uses..     Windows 98: pro: fastest operating system to use. cons : older with less visual experience.    millenium: pro: good with usage and visual style: cons: repeated system crashes.    xp: pro: best operating system which lasted for long cons: less security.    vista: pro: security has taken important place in this os cons: slow and f***ing slow.    windows 7: pro: ------- cons: many many many..it was just a testing version released. so many bugs to use. i hope you don't try it now because many softwares are not yet supporting it. because it has not yet been released. so they have not yet designed softwares for this os.    mac: pro : a good operating system with no virus attacks and maximum of the works can be done with GUI . commands doesn't take a big role in this OS. cons: doesn't support any software other than that designed by apple.    fedora and ubuntu: both are linux and almost the same except some appreances. it needs good command usage user for it to work fine.      Out of these what i suggest is a mac if you prefer to have a good experience with your laptop..  But if you want to install what ever software you need then i want you to go for windows...      Iam using apple iphone, apple ipod and macbook pro ( usually for experience wise usage) hp pavilion tx2500z ( vista 64 bit ) for my work usage.    I think this info helps you decide which version you need. [:)]  njoy.. you have a great day.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	I think instead of asking for general pros and cons, you should tell us what you plan to use your computer for. Your brother, for example, does a lot of design work, so a Mac makes sense for him. What do you do?|`|ZLI8Ogdlaa	It depends on the user.|`|AA10013202	i would say MAC is the best!  no more similar questions plz|`|XJSOToRGaa	First of all windows 7 is currently only a beta - if you upgrade, understand that it will stop working when the beta period is over (MS is also not allowing anyone else to DL it, which isnt to say it can't be found).    Now, on to the meat and potatoes of your question.  Macs are known for their ability to handle video/photo editing, and are generally considered the more 'artsy' choice.  And while in the past the lack of options was a valid argument, with the intel based structure macs are now able to do pretty much everything.    I am a long time windows user who recently purchased a mac (After buying and returning a vista laptop, yuck).  Few things that make it ideal: 1. the os is as solid as anything that exists.  You rarely if ever have to reboot, and viruses that actually effect macs are VERY rare   2. There is a program called 'crossover' that lets you run many windows applications natively in OSX.  3. You can now boot a mac to windows, so all you would need to do is buy a copy of windows xp and voila, best of both worlds...it integrates SEAMLESSLY in the intel based macs.    Now the negative is that apple charges an INSANE amount for their hardware: you can get a lot more hardware for less if you go with a dell/hp, however in the long run the mac makes better use of the hardware it has (I wont go into detail about how, but trust me, 1GB of ram on a mac is = 3GB in vista).  The biggest issue I had with my mac was the lack of right-click, but an external mouse solved that for me.  I now love my mac, run windows xp on it as needed, and use crossover for anything else.|`|2iXOaVQoaa	Ubuntu 8.10 (Linux) Owns all OS's!  No viruses or anything. :)    http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download  http://wubi-installer.org/    It has more freedom than Windows and Mac put together, and It's all open source, so you are free to do what you want.    The only con that I can think of at the moment is that it's not 'Hey, this is easy.'  It takes time to explore and figure things out, but when you do figure everything out, you are like 'Dang, this owns all.' :)|`|pwkeo7tTaa	"you get a lot more options on MAC then Windows."     That is no longer true, as both Apple and Non-Apple computer now use the same hardware. Web designing is always best on Windows because a web designer needs to test their work on many different web browsers especially IE (the most used web browser in the world).    When it comes to power Window still dominates over Mac because a user is able to install more powerful CPUs and video cards; this cannot be done on Mac (except Mac Pro) because no drivers are made for them to be upgraded in such a way.    Any user who requires flexibility should avoid Apple: both their hardware and software are proprietary.|`|bf7944554f80e6a064f17c13dbdc4547aa	Mac is much more stable(crahes, hanging etc)than windows, thats why animation studios around the world prefer to use it. but the problem is that only legal softwares work in mac. that means either yu will to pay for the softwares or use a legal one. so cost is a factor in mac. for windows well we can do anything, exept the stability issues.

Er5J9BZSaa	You can separate them completely by subnetting.     For example, instead of your standard 255.255.255.0 class C subnet. You could logically separate the addresses and keep ranges independent from other servers or broaden it.     so 255.255.255.224 would give you usable addresses:    132.222.231.1 - 132.222.231.30 (.0 is your network address, .31 is broadcast) This would logically separate the first two addresses of 132.222.231.22 and 132.222.231.19.    The next usable range would begin with 132.222.231.33 and so on. Just count each increment.  This would cover 132.222.231.38 and 132.222.231.51.     So all four addresses are logically separated by 2 networks.     YES. In your scenario, two servers could belong to company A, and the other 2 servers would belong to company B with complete separation unless there is a route to each independent network on the router.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	IP addresses are divided up into classes. The class determines how many IP addresses you can put into one network block. In a typical class C network, the normal number of addresses is 256. You can divide larger network blocks down into smaller networks called subnets. This is done to make address available or to isolate parts of a larger network from one another.    To answer your question, the top-level network in question (132.0.0.0) can have over 16 thousand addresses. It's likely that the owner of this network has it subnetted, but the addresses you listed do belong to the name network.    As far as separate, the chances are that these four hosts belong to the same network entity. It's possible that one or two of these could fall in different networks if they were subnetted, but in all likelihood, they're on the same network.|`|cBT6Qrbhaa	Most larger corporations will buy a subnet which would be 132.222.231.x  so yes all those ips could belong to the same company, but it really depends on the ISP. The ips you posted could belong to a number of different businesses who were assigned that  ip range from the ISP.  Most businesses will have a larger subnet to utilize addressing for multiple servers/hosts or departments.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	It depends upon the subnet mask which you have not provided.      With the information provided the answer to your question is a very firm "maybe".
uQTtwuT7aa	No, the player is not illegal. The movies that you watch using the veoh player may be illegal, though. A good rule of thumb is: if it is a movie that is protected against copying and available for sale, and you have not paid to watch it, then it is illegal to watch it.|`|AA10954273	The player is legal.  Using it (or anything else) to watch content that's under copyright without paying is illegal.  So if you use the Veoh player to watch someone's home movie, that's fine.  If you use it to watch a movie that's available in theaters or on DVD, you've committed a crime.    Use common sense.  If you have to pay for something at a legal store, but someone offers it to you for free, chances are that it's illegal.

pUzJiMUcaa	ASP.NET Membership is a built in feature of the framework for managing users and logins and all that. Furthermore, you can use ActiveDirectoryMembership if you want to avoid a database altogether. You can manage your DVD library from an XML file (not ideal...but if you want to get around a database...)    Of course, it's a lot to explain, but MSDN has an article all about it here:    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/...    EDIT: Joe, we all have to start somewhere. If you don't want to help people, don't hang out in Q&A forums. Honestly, people like you hurt the programming field more than those who don't know exactly what the are doing. Our clubhouse isn't full...and since this person is asking for help while in the learning process, the least you can do is shut up and let em learn.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	If you're unable to figure this out at this stage of your programming education, you should stop. Now.    First of all, if you don't know or haven't learned SQL for using databases at this stage, then you'd be wasting your time trying to use a database. You would be better off keeping it simple and reading/writing the data to and from text file, or, if you want a real challenge, XML files.    This is nothing "simple" about what you need to do, I would suggest that you dig into the language reference and figure this out.    You see, this is what programmers do. We are asked by people who know nothing to create an application to do something. The idea is that we, the programmers, are smart enough to figure out what to do.     You're asking someone to do your homework for you.    No, don't Google it. Read the language references and figure it out.|`|NtDp64EXaa	I tried setting up a website on my own and like the professional suggested, I had no clue and it was a trainwreck.  I did research and found a company that specializes in Web Design, Search Engine Optimization and Hosting.  Of course I paid for their services but was so happy with the results and them allowing my input.  You may want to check them out.  Their pricing was way lower than other companies.  http//:www.triton.net
NrrYG0f6aa	Your resolution on your PC is set to a level that the monitor can't handle. Start out on a low resolution like 800x600 then progressively work your way up to the highest that your monitor will accept.    .........................................    Before disconnecting your CRT set your Windows resolution to 800x600, then connect the LCD. Do you know how to change the display resolution in Windows? If not do you have Windows XP or Vista?    .........................................    There should be a menu system on the LCD itself. Does it allow you to switch between different input types. If so, try switching inputs to see what happens.
YVXuLLKVaa	If you are referring to Microsoft, I think its pretty neat to have an indeterminate number of Windows OS's running on my machine simultaineously.|`|XJSOToRGaa	On what level, server or personal use?  I make use of vmware on a regular basis from my mac allowing me to run windows on it...and I also run a 'virtual domain' at home on my PC...many of our application servers at work are also virtualized.  There are tons of advantages: minimum hardware requirements for, essentially, multiple PCs...etc etc etc cost savings, power savings and so forth...    Disadvantage of course being that if you encounter a hardawre issue, it's going to hose everything - so to go with your virtualization you need to make sure you have redundancy.
tOCESHLYaa	I've seen some tests where F-secure did not do very good on a infected machine. It was unable to clean it. While Norton, Kaspersky, and some other security software could. So if you have an infected machine I would not waste my money. If your machine is clean then you should be ok with f-secure. But Kaspersky is a very good program. That would be my pick.I'm currently testing a beta of Kaspersky and it is working great. In the past Kaspersky Internet Security would slow down Internet surfing but they seem to have fixed that.Plus Kaspersky allows you to tweak all setting so you can set it the way you want. The firewall in Kaspersky is one of the stronger ones.|`|LClopaGtaa	Neither, get Eset, http://www.eset.com/   get a Full trial.|`|eQOZkMp8aa	I use f-secure    http://tipscoms.blogspot.com/|`|iXwA5wAlaa	Webroot spysweeper.  Hasn't let me down yet.|`|0EPkAWs9aa	If your PC is clean and well-protected, then stay with F-Secure and enjoy safe surfing. There's no real need to switch between Internet Security Suites.  Just avoid using P2P networks, Outlook Express and IE, do not visit risky sites (adult, gambling, etc) and you're OK.
ZZR9OTzVaa	What I would do is check the folder where the torrent is downloaded to, and delete all the temporary files.  That should free up the space on your hard drive.      Hitting stop will not get rid of those files (usually) so you have to open the folder yourself and throw those files away.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Torrents, by general default, allocate the space on your hard drive before the downloading even begins.  This can be changed in your options, but I wouldn't really recommend it unless you are low on space.    Therefore you will have to check your torrent software to see how much of which file has been downloaded, if it's offered to be shown.  uTorrent does that, and it is what I use.

VdHKQMeXaa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|2iXOaVQoaa	Easy fix...Ubuntu 8.10 Linux!    http://wubi-installer.org/    The install on that site will keep your XP intact, but will let you select Ubuntu instead.

Whether you can fix it, depends on your comfort level with opening up a laptop.  It's usually not as easy as opening up a desktop PC.  So, the northbridge (for your edification) is a chip, and its primary function is your memory controller -- so it's a pretty important piece.  The northbridge fan cools your northbridge chip -- you want it to be cool.  I can't tell you which kind of fan they're using for your particular northbridge, but if it's field-replaceable, then there's a chance you might be able to find a replacement at a local electronics store (like a Radio Shack, or Fry's).  Just pop it out if you can, and take it with you -- someone should be able to help you find the right one.  Good luck.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It's a little pinwheel-type rotary device that blows air on the north bridge chip.  Seriously, one of the fans in the laptop is going bad - that's the noise.  It might be possible for you to replace it yourself - it depends on how much you have to disassemble to get to it.  You'll have to buy the replacement from the laptop manufacturer.|`|vNaAZU3gaa	the north bridge and the south bridge are you main cpu's. If there is a problem with fan it needs to be replaced asap. If there is a proble with one of the bridges you might have lost some of your files. I hope you have all your stuff backed up on some other software or Mozy.. You can check the bios on your computer to see what's going on. If you want to change out your fan, I suggest you watch you tube videos on how to do it. Im a computer hardware student and I watch those videos all the time, because Im a visual learner. I hope my answer was you were looking for..|`|QbcnDDxUaa	I would suggest opening the case and checking to see if theres something causing the blockage. I dont know about your model specificly, but mine moves a good amount of air, and in just a fwe monts of constant use, it has built up a baby dust monster. Cant hurt to check after all, since tech support wont give you the time of day. Could be that the fan is really on its last legs. Again, not being familiar with your specific model, I dno't know how easy it would be to replace that fan...but i couldn't imagine it would be too difficult.|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	The North bridge chip has a fan on it!. Yours either needs lube or it needs to be replaced! It will be under the keyboard and it'll be the chip that's a bit smaller than the processor! A precision oiler usually will do the job, but don't use but a tiny drop! ;-)=|`|3pMVVZ3Taa	it is possible, to remove the fan and replace, but laptops are sometimes incredibly difficult to take apart, and hard to find the correct components. Even taking it into the shop can cost more than its worth if the laptop is more than a year or two old. The Northbridge is the graphics and memory controller on your motherboard, if the fan goes out it may overheat and fry the board. look at the cost to have repairs and if it costs more than $200 or so I'd buy a new laptop, also check your warranty, ignore the first person's response. There is always a polite way to say things.|`|BF0iubETaa	Yeh sure u can unscrew the laptop and put in a new fan.  Its literally jus taking the old fan out, duznt matter if u accidentally rip out a motherboard-looking thing, its not important.  Then u can jus tape a new fan onto it. My personal favourite and the one I have on my laptop right now is found here http://store.onestopshopcatalog.net/mc-4...    After that you can realize that that was incredably stupid and TAKE IT INTO A SHOP|`|CQXGO1M5aa	If you don't know what it is, then you don't want to risk fixing it yourself. Laptop repair is generally more difficult then a normal PC.    Bottom line - take it to a repair shop. You'll need a specialized replacement fan.

bnCiNAQdaa	if you completely repartition it, you will lose whatever is there.  but if you resize it, and just format the newly created "free" space, you will be OK.    to DJ Wings:  are you for real with this answer !?!?!?!?  "Second reason, when you do partition the drive, your OS will be working on a smaller scale when is comes to trying to find all the files required for bootup. The more room you give the OS, the more the computer will like you."    that is COMPLETELY WRONG. the smaller your OS partition, the better the OS works. think of it this way:  you have a room thats 100' x 100' , and you are in the center. you need pick up a sock against each wall. so you start out, walk to wall  1, then walk to wall  2, etc. this would take about 60-80 seconds.  now you are in a room that is 10' x 10', same scenario. it would take about 20 seconds to pick up the socks.  which is faster?  same goes for how the OS would find files(socks) on a larger partition (room) compared to a smaller one.|`|Pj2EqQbDaa	Two things. You do not want to partition the drive. Reason is yes. it will delete the movies off of there by format. If you have a separate hard drive or a external drive, take all the movies and put them on there.     I myself wouldn't partition any hard drive because it would mess things up for me on the same physical drive, but instead buy a external and put everything that is valuable to me on that while my computer is free from the clutter.     Second reason, when you do partition the drive, your OS will be working on a smaller scale when is comes to trying to find all the files required for bootup. The more room you give the OS, the more the computer will like you.    It is also advised to turn into NTFS rather than Fat32 because it adds more security to all of the files that is stored into the system.|`|F2XxqlVfaa	get parted and burn the image to cd. if you delete the partition yes you will lose it all. however if its currently ntfs then you will want to run defrag on it. then insert gparted and RESIZE the partition. turn the free space into fat32 and that should do it for you without deleting anything unless you resize the beginning of the partition.|`|eUY1Zmudaa	yes when you re partition a hard drive it deletes any exciting ones, so anything you have on that partition will be gone. and after you repartition the hard drive, you'll need to reformat the drive to fat32.
eWMn7dhKaa	I do not believe there to be a hard limit on the length of a video in Windows Movie Maker.  I could be wrong, but I'm pretty confident it can go past 5 hours or more.|`|0S344Tefaa	Actually, there's no limit duration of video when going use the windows movie maker. You need to do is drag the time frame or time line of the video. The last thing is try to use another software when it come movie or video editing.such as Adobe premier or pro show.
rHoXUM3jaa	you should download it from your visualboy advance program with the file .gba if it does not say .gba then it won't work. Go to Open rom on your visual boy advance, and open a file with .gba at the end. If you want to download some good real roms, go to doperoms.com. Remember in order to play you need the visual boy advance program and from the visual boy advance program open the (for example: supermarioworld.gba) All roms you open must be a .gba file.|`|g54tGcRvaa	You don't need a special program to download ROMs, you just need to find an online ROM archive.  There are lots of them.  GBA ROMs usually have a gba extension, or sometimes bin.  Visual Boy Advance is pretty much the best GB/GBC/GBA emulator out there.
scOcY1tMaa	Delete your current Anti-virus stuff.    Download AVG Anti-virus software.    Run it.    If no go, try buying Norton's Antivirus or the complete Internet service pack.    Search for stuff that advertises what you need.  There's lots of free stuff to try out, (before buying anything).    About your defragger, you need to reinstall the OS if after removing the trojan it still does not work.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	As far as defrag, unless there's a problem, or you don't have enough free space on the drive, your defrag program should work.  If not, try:    http://www.auslogics.com/disk-defrag  http://www.kessels.com/Jkdefrag/ (very good)    As far as the Trojan or virus (the two terms refer to things that are mutually exclusive - one can't be the other) I can't help you - I never touch the stuff.|`|eg9wjUQ7aa	I had a trojan recently that i was unable to get rid of as well. I downloaded Trojan Remover from Simply Super http://www.simplysup.com It's a trial version, but i only needed to use it once. For your disk defragmenter, you could get Jdiskreport, it's almost exactly like the windows one, except it goes into much more depth, allowing you to look into individual files and folders. Good Luck!|`|fqCB7I8Gaa	If you know where it is try Unlocker it did amazing things for me---      ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker    good luck,   bronco.|`|hGVXek1faa	Windows by default hides two type of files from a users eyes...hidden files and System Files.    You can go into folder options and uncheck the box to each one concerning the hiding of files.    Try running your virus scanner in safe mode.    Try disabling startup items, sometimes the virus will show in the list.  Start Menu-->Run-->type msconfig and hit enter  This will pop up a system configuration utility.  Now you want the "Start Up" tab  Uncheck anything you do not want to load when windows starts and reboot.    I am guessing the folder your virus resides in is the system32 folder. If yes, right click and sort the files by when modified. Look at the exact time the virus was made, the match that time up to other files. File with the same date/time are very likely to be a support file of the virus...I would first google the filenames of questionable files before doing anything like deleting it.

SrfLbfwMaa	In Excel2007, there is a command called "What-If Analysis"    I think you are talking about this    Right?    VBAXLMan|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It asks, "what if?"    IOW, if you have an idea that increasing your price will cause some people to stop buying your product, and the more you raise it, the more people will stop buying it - and you have an idea of what the actual numbers are - you can set up a spreadsheet to say "what if we raised the price by the amount in cell A1 - what would our annual sales be?"  then you could plug various numbers into A1 and see what happens.  Raising your price by some amount may actually be a good thing, because the price will go up more than the customers will stop buying.  but if you raise it a little more you start losing money.    That's just a simple example.

b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	It's not even a graphics card! So the answer there is no! You will not be able to play any graphically intensive games to a satisfactory level on that integrated graphics chipset! You need at least a Geforce 8600GT or above to keep up with most current games & a 9600GT or above to keep up with most future releases!|`|mE3wNi8Raa	no,it is an integrated (MGPU) it sucks integrated graphics are not for gaming,for gaming to run a game on lowest setting you need at least a geforce 8400,evon though the 8400 sucks its still so much better than the integrated intel.if you want to run games on medium i would suggest a geforce 8600 but for running games on high i would say you need at least a 9600GT|`|AA12149874	it is integrated to the motherboard,SO the answer is NO.any integrated graphics card on motherboard are so bad for a even a reasonable gaming experience.    you may buy it because it is not expensive but be sure that it has a PCI express 16x slot so you can add a graphic card to it.    you can still play old games on it but new ones with high specifications required will run so slow even on 800*600 resolution (if the game supports it)|`|cV7FgDHbaa	Well, on board graphics are never that great for true gaming, but it also depends on the types of games you are trying to play..    Are you trying to run simple games or more complex 3D games? Do you have light effects or shading in your games? Or if they are online with other people and may have a lot going on at once, things like this can be very stressful on graphic cards.    Most new 3D games I know these days require a graphics cards with pixel shader capabilities. I'd suggest something with a 512 MB or higher graphic memory.   *Trusted brands by me are NVIDIA GeForce series, or ATI Radeon*  Computers have different plug-ins so make sure you get a card that you can actually put into your computer, buying one that does not fit would be a downer.    Graphics cards can be expensive but you can buy new ones on eBay from trusted sellers only, check for good references and past history, and also compare with in store princes, you can save a bundle.   Just make sure as well that you have enough ram to support your gaming. You also may want to see if your power supply is still good and if the fan is not broken.. (I had one burn out on me once and the heat from it actually burnt my graphics card to the point it broke and I had to replace it- so keep an eye on these things.) I know this seems like a lot to do for some gaming but it's also heart breaking to buy a game and take it home just to know you can't actually play it..    Hope that wasn't too much, I did not go into very intense detail but in short, I think you'd need to buy a new card to play good games with, but you can always test it! Remember, if it's also having troubles, try to change settings to Preformance, rather then Quality, it may help minimize your overall lag and improve playing.
2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	Huh?  Devices like ATA hard drives, CD drives, case fans etc have male connectors so what's needed are extra female power leads. So that cable you linked should work.    What are you trying to connect?|`|6aLOwNMwaa	that is exactly what you need that you linked. nobody i know has the opposite because your psu is female and your drives are male. there for you need a male to 2 female splitter which that is. the only reason why you would have to go reverse is if something is extremely power hungry.
LF2t9DPZaa	That would depend entirely on the Rock class and what methods and constructors are available on it.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  You can't set a Rock equal to "r1", because "r1" is a String and a Rock is not a String. (Rock can't be a subclass of String, because String is a final class.)<br>  <br>  It might be easier to help if you explained what you're trying to do and why you would want to do something like this.|`|ww6nm7gfaa	To put it simply, you cannot do it the way you are trying to do it. It can, however, be done. Once you declare a variable called name, you cannot then declare it again as something else, so you cannot say "Rock name" because name is a String. If you want your rock to be named "r1" you need to have some instance variable in your rock class that tracks the rock's name, that is what "private String name" does. But we also need to set this to our string, so our constructor, which creates our object, receives a string that it then assigns to the instance variable name. Then when we construct our rock, we pass it the string that we wish it to be called. When we print our rock, we call an "accessor" (gets values) to return the rock's name. Once you are comfortable with this, you can instead replace "getName()" with "toString()" which is invoked automatically when printing an object, toString() returns a string representation of the object, so in this case, we could simply use "r1" as our return value. But that's for after you are comfortable with this.  After looking at this for a while, try adding another variable to describe the rock's colour, and another accessor to return the rock's colour, then try creating two rocks with different names and colours, and print them both out, with their names and colours.<br>  <br>  public class Rock<br>  {<br>      private String name;<br>      <br>      public static void main( String[] argv )<br>      {<br>          String name = "r1";<br>          Rock myRock = new Rock( name );<br>          System.out.println( "the rock's name is: " + rock.getName() );<br>      }<br>      <br>      public Rock( String nameOfThisRock )<br>      {<br>          this.name = nameOfThisRock;<br>      }<br>      <br>      public String getName( )<br>      {<br>          return this.name;<br>      }<br>  }

kAclw3XDaa	The Pentium Dual Core T4200 should be fine for you. <br>  <br>  Also, an 802.11g card can only bring you so far in this ever-evolving world.

Leave it as is. <br>  Any more higher processors are really for gaming and high-performance gaming. <br>  <br>  There is no need to upgrade unless you know how to build computers. <br>  if you do get a higher processor then get a 3.0 processor that is COMPATIBLE to the motherboard.

To add memory depends on the computer.  Basically, you open up the case of a desktop or open up a little access panel on a laptop.  In either case, you need to find the memory which is already in there and push the little retainer pins to the side to release it from the socket.  You have to discharge any static charge you might have by touching a ground source such as a water pipe or you may zap and destroy the memory.  Take the memory to your favorite computer store so they can be sure to give you the right kind of memory, also note down the computer model and take that with you.  When you get the new memory, put it in an empty slot, if any.  Then put in the memory you took out if there's still an empty slot.

XlyLakYAaa	Well, laptops are the dominant computer on campuses because of their size and portability.  Transporting a desktop is a pain (I should know, I did it many times an often confused the hell out of airport security).  However, looking back I probably would have still brought by desktop because I love powerful computers.  If you don't need a super powerful computer, a laptop might be a better choice.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Laptops.<br>  <br>  Trust me, portability is worth it. <br>  <br>  And about the whole them getting stolen, if you are smart and carry your laptop with you everywhere or hide it in a decent place when you aren't around, <br>  <br>  A desktop is nice, but then you'll have to do all your work wherever the desktop is located. When the weather is nice, nothing beats being outside and enjoying the weather. <br>  <br>  And laptops aren't that hard to fix. Whoever told you this really has no clue what they are talking about. Yes, there are some things that aren't as easy to fix (a motherboard malfunction or the processor dying), but that's because replacing them would require taking the laptop apart.

DQtD9P9Haa	2005 and 2008 are nearly identical, any differences can easily be looked up on the internet.<br>  The problem is projects made in 2005 are usually incompatible with the 2008 version.|`|405caad2defc93e4e2201178f72bf6e4aa	The latest incarnation of C#.NET includes the following:<br>  <br>  1. Implicitly Typed Local Variables and Arrays:<br>  <br>  How? by the use of var keyword.<br>  <br>  So now you can declare a variable like the following:<br>  <br>  var a = "Sunil"; <br>  <br>  The good thing is as soon as this is initialized at runtime the compiler will infer its type from the value and make it strongly typed. So in the above example this will become a string type.<br>  <br>  2. Auto-Implemented Properties<br>  <br>  Remember the old style properties<br>  <br>  private int myVar;<br>  <br>  public int MyProperty<br>  {<br>  get { return myVar; }<br>  set { myVar = value; }<br>  }<br>  <br>  Now see the shortened style:<br>  <br>  public int MyProperty {get; set;}<br>  <br>  What happened to backing field. Don’t worry about that, now it will be generated at the compile time by the compiler in the following way<br>  <br>  private int<MyProperty>k__BackingField;<br>  <br>  3. Object initialization without explicit calls to a constructor.<br>  <br>  How? See the example below:<br>  <br>  We have a class TestProp like this:<br>  <br>  public class TestProp<br>  {<br>  public string NameOfUser { get; set; }<br>  public string NameOfTester { get; set; } <br>  public void Method1()<br>  {<br>  MessageBox.Show(NameOfTester + ": " + NameOfUser);<br>  }<br>  }<br>  We can use it like this:<br>  <br>  TestProp tp = new TestProp()<br>  { <br>  NameOfUser = "Sunil";<br>  NameOfTester = "Kishore" <br>  }<br>  <br>  tp.Method1();<br>  <br>  Notice how we have initialized the two properties in a comma separated style.<br>  <br>  4. Extension Methods<br>  <br>  Remember good old days when you have got a sealed class and you cannot extend it. Very sad. Now with C#2008 you can extend any class in .NET by using extension method. How? See example<br>  <br>  public sealed class TestX<br>  {<br>  public void WriteMe(string s)<br>  {<br>  Console.WriteLine(s);<br>  }<br>  }Notice class TestX has only WriteMe method.public static class ExtTestX<br>  {<br>  public static void ReadMe(this TestX s, string v)<br>  {<br>  Console.ReadLine();<br>  }<br>  }<br>  <br>  Notice this is a static class and the parameter of ReadMe Method is this TestX s, which shows that its an extension of TestX class. The actual parameter for this method is only one that is string v.<br>  <br>  Now we are ready to use this as:<br>  <br>  TestX ss = new TestX();<br>  ss.ReadMe("s");<br>  <br>  Notice ReadMe method is available on TestX object now.<br>  <br>  5. Partial Methods<br>  <br>  Now with C#2008 even your methods are partial types. Don’t worry this doesn’t mean that you can write a single method a more than one place, it just means that you can now reserve some method name and signature for use in future. The rules are it must have void return type. At compile time the compiler will remove your partial method definition and code where ever it is called.<br>  <br>  7. Lambda Expressions<br>  <br>  It now enables inline expressions with input parameters that can be bound to delegates or expression trees.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	The development environment is virutally the same. <br>  <br>  I wound't buy any books either... there is an incridible wealth of code samples on the internet written in C#. <br>  <br>  I added a link with 101 C# code  samples, that should be enough fodder for you to get going anyway.<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=08E3D5F8-033D-420B-A3B1-3074505C03F3&displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...</a><br>  <br>  Also, you can download the C# language specification here:<br>  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336809.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/...</a>

2RQ4qDhXaa	The Pro has a much better video card and a screen that's 2" bigger.. Looking at the 2.4GHz Pro, that's about the only difference. If you aren't going to do a lot of 3D rendering, the suped-up MacBook is about the same as the entry level Pro, only cheaper.<br>  <br>  I don't recomend getting the RAM from the Apple Store: you can find cheaper RAM of the same quality at OWC (www.macsales.com).

The macbook pro is really more of a desktop replacement and it costs a lot more.|`|hMPhj66Aaa	The main differences between the two, if they have identical specs, is the  screen size, materials, and age. The MacBook Pro is a 15 inch screen, while the macbook is 13 inch. This extra 2 inches adds a lot of screen real estate, but makes it harder to cary around. The Macbook pro (unless it is the newer unibody kind) are made of aluminum, while the regular macbook is plastic, this makes the pro heavier but significantly sturdier and nicer feeling. Also, the MacBook Pro may be older, as the pro generally has higher specs at any given time. If the computer is new, then this will not be true|`|CYmGQZxUaa	I would suggest that you should get a 13-inch Macbook. It is a very easy computer to use, and it is more portable with it's small design. The Pro and Mac book are basically the same thing if the have the same RAM and GHz.

I wanted to add a third display (two displays are already working just fine off the 3450 card), so I purchased a HIS X1550 PCIe x1 card. <br>  <br>  Only thing is, it didn't work in either of the x1 slots (whether the 3450 card was in, or removed); worse, when I tried it in an x1 slot without the 3450 card, I got the typical beeps of a missing graphics card. <br>  <br>  And when I booted the system with the X1550 (in either slot) and the 3450 installed, the on-board ethernet didn't show up in Windows either. (So I'm assuming there's some kind of HW resource/IRQ conflict, at least in Windows.)<br>  <br>  The X1550 worked just fine in the x16 slot (although I didn't bother updating the driver software: I just wanted to make sure the card wasn't defective: it wasn't). And the NIC connected just fine with the X1550 in the x16 slot.<br>  <br>  I've googled around trying to see if you can have an x16 and an x1 graphics card at the same time, but I got nothin' (so far); I did read that you can't use the [Dell] onboard graphics and a PCIe card at the same time.<br>  <br>  I'm going to ask this as a Yahoo question, too ...but I thought someone in this thread might be able to help.<br>  <br>  TIA.|`|k5KuYkkKaa	You do have a PCIe x1 slot, but not a PCIe x16.

dkpIjt5jaa	As long as your board has a PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) slot, your graphics card (with DDR3, 4 or 5) will fit and as the logic for it is on the card, your board will handle it.<br>  <br>  The Intel has the needed slot as seen here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/motherboard/dg31pr/configs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.intel.com/products/motherboar...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The bigger question is will your PSU handle it ?<br>  <br>  For the right way of calculating the power a PSU must give out, you MUST look at the BIG picture and take many other things into account not just the graphics card. <br>  <br>  <br>  The real lowdown on how much power is needed for PC systems !<br>  <br>  For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately* how much wattage you will need to run various normal common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):<br>  <br>  The Motherboard: 15-30<br>  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100<br>  RAM: about 7 per 128MB (or 56 W per GB)<br>  PCI add-in card: 5<br>  High-End graphics board: 60-100 (some take more)<br>  IDE/SATA hard drive: 10-30<br>  Optical CD/DVD drive: 10-25<br>  <br>  <br>  So let's calculate a system (again, this is an approximation*) with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including one (high-end) graphic card), 1 hard drive and 1 optical drive.<br>  <br>  That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+100+30+25 = 524<br>  <br>  * It has to be an approximation as I'm missing some details of your system.<br>  <br>  So compare your entire computer specs with the list and refine the math on your own, you will then know if your PSU will support the GPU. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: <br>  <br>  Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 600 Watts and get up to 700 Watts if the price difference is not too much for you.<br>  <br>  Also, always compare PSUs on cost AND caliber, in other words, go for power supplies that have a "quality build" never for one where the cost is cheap (because you can be sure it's not only the price that is that way).<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: My guide is partly based on this link: <a href="http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/powersuppliesGuide.html" rel="nofollow">http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power...</a>|`|SJM0rzHtaa	The graphics card's memory type have absolutely NOTHING to do with the motherboard.   You can use any graphics card with any motherboard as long as both card and mobo have the same kind of slot interface (such as PCI Express).

For the most part video cards aren't upgradable for laptops.|`|daf653722b9a000bcaed6ea65b1dc5e6aa	No, you are not a complete techno-retard. We all make those mistakes. I have, and that is why I feel your pain.<br>  <br>  Unless you know that you bought a gaming laptop, just assume that the laptop wont do much in the way of graphics.<br>  <br>  Normally, for laptops (and for most desktops, too) the graphics card is built into the motherboard (onboard graphics card, is what they call it). With desktops though they do have PCI and PCI-E slots that allows me to disable the onboard graphics card and upgrade to a differnt graphics card.<br>  <br>  Trust me, I have been on the lookout for a PCMCIA (that tiny rectangular slot, about an inch and a half long) graphics card, similar to PCMCIA sound cards.<br>  <br>  For now, however, you are kinda stuck with it, so I suggest move all your gaming to your PC (as I have done) or a XBOX (if you like it that way).|`|toUIGDTeaa	Sorry most laptops can but you can double check my calling the manafacter of your computer and give them you model number and serel number they will tell you if it can be upgraded or not.
AA11763018	Copyright protects “original works of authorship” that are fixed in a tangible form of expression (for example, a written/recorder  song is copyright protected). This means:<br>  ? Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created, and a work is “created” when it is fixed in a tangible form for the first time. <br>  Tangible form implies that the work can be read or visually perceived or hear either directly or with the aid of a device.<br>  ? You don't need to do any action in the Copyright Office to secure copyright<br>  <br>  BUT in case of legal dispute in relation to a copyright infringement, you need to have a proof that shows the validity of your copyright rights.<br>  A way to obtain this proof is to register your copyright. The copyright registration is a a legal formality intended to make a public record of the basic facts of a particular copyright. <br>  However, have in mind that:<br>  ? The registration is not a requirement for copyright protection.<br>  ? It is a accepted proof of your legal rights.<br>  ?

The American public must have tapioca pudding for brains.|`|SNZ88BfKaa	I never knew the difference between tile horizontally and tile vertically. For example, does tile horizontally mean that the windows are oriented horizontally, so they are on top of each other, or does it mean that they run across the screen horizontally, so they are next to each other? The terms were vague. It's better to say stacked and side by side. Much more clear and user friendly. That doesn't mean the users are dumber, just that they don't want to spend time trying to figure out which is which.<br>  <br>  However, appealing to dumber people is not a bad thing. If windows became difficult to use it would lose it's large user base, and therefore money. Microsoft wants to make their product easier to use. This is a good thing, not a bad thing. I don't see why you're complaining about it.<br>  <br>  If you feel you're too smart for Windows, move to Linux.

Every time you change a driver, you risk installing something that might have bugs in it that could crash your computer, or even prevent it from starting up.  You should always install drivers by hand, one at a time, and verify that each new driver works correctly and doesn't break anything or crash the system before moving on to another driver.<br>  <br>  Additionally, you should only update a driver if you are sure that you need to update it.  If everything works as it is now, don't update anything.

A field is always selected as soon as you place the cursor in the field.

AA10570173	There are papers that are referred to as resume papers. They are a higher quality paper than standard white paper you would use in a copier or inkjet printer. They tend to be a little heavier or stiffer, and often have a slight texture or woven look. They can come in different colors too. A nice ivory/off-white paper looks nicer than the flat bright white of regular printer or copier paper.<br>  <br>  The best and easiest way to do this is to go to a local copy shop (Kinkos/UPS store, one of the office supply stores such as Staples also often have a copy/print center too) and ask them for "resume papers". It will cost you maybe a couple of dollars to print several copies on the nicer paper, but it won't be a huge amount, and it does look nicer.|`|lye7pmabaa	i own my own computer solutions company and when i need quality paer i always use pure white between 120gms to 160gms and this is always excellent price range from between ￡5 and ￡ 8|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i had to do this i think last week<br>  it means not flimsy, printer paper type paper<br>  nicer, more stiff paper<br>   just make sure its not creased or anything

HyWeOyT4aa	As long as you can access the recovery manager (start, all programs, recovery manager) you do not need any discs, you can do a system recovery from there. You were supposed to burn a set of recovery discs, this is done in the recovery manager as well. You need to do this, so if your hard drive crashes you can reinstall windows. The system recovery will wipe out all your files and will return your computer EXACTLY like it was the first time you ever turned it on, so back up anything you want that wasn't there in the beginning. What kind of problems are you having, if they are not major there is no need in doing this, try doing a system restore first. Go to start, all programs, accessories, system tools, then system restore, and just pick a date prior to the problems you are having, Some real time protection programs such as norton will prevent you from doing a system restore so disable them first.<br>  <br>  <br>  You aren't making any sense. I told you exactly how to do this. If you haven't made the recovery discs, make them, but you do not need them to do a system recovery as long as your system is up and running. Go to the recovery manager like I told you, then just do a system recovery, this will return your computer to just like the day you bought it. There is a partition in your hard drive with the factory version of your computer, the recovery manager accesses this and does what I just said. You only need your recovery discs in the even of a HDD failure, or inability to boot your operating system. You still should make them though some day. By the way, you will never "lose" your OS, worst case scenario is purchasing the recovery discs from Toshiba for your computer for 20.00$, you just need your product and serial numbers.|`|dnTRSObDaa	beware that a format would completely wipe your harddisk of ALL data. simply put, to reinstall the OS you need the installation disc. however, some laptops come with preinstalled recovery partitions that can restore the laptop to factory defaults when used with a recovery cd/dvd. if this isnt true in your case, you really need that disc.|`|MP4Kp8hoaa	create your own recovery cd...system tools > recovery manager.

bQTWX32taa	Well those laptops should have an image of the system as it was when shipped from the factory ..  If you haven't got a windows disc and cant get into windows normally then you may need to restore the image so you can get back to the factory  shipped windows config (that is if you haven't got a hardware failure like a bad hard drive that is causing the problem. <br>  <br>    First try getting into windows safe mode by tapping F8  for boot options as soon as  you turn the lappy on  if you can get into safe mode with networking you can run a check disk by opening the command prompt  and typing chkdsk /r and then click y to schedule a disk scan and then reboot.<br>     <br>    You may also want to scan for spyware while in  in safe mode with malwarebytes antispyware w to make sure spyware isn't causing the problems if that does not help then read below for steps to restore your system to factory settings.<br>  <br>    These steps will return the system to the original factory installation.Back up all important  files prior to using this procedure.<br>  <br>  Plug in the AC adapter .<br>  Turn the system on<br>  Immediately, press ALT on the keyboard and start tapping F10.<br>  Continue holding ALT and tapping F10 as the unit boots up.<br>  A screen stating "Starting Acer Erecovery" should appear. <br>  (Release ALT and stop tapping F10 at this point)<br>  There will be 4 options:<br>  1.

Thus, I recently spent<br>  2 hours googling, researching and reading multiple-dozens of<br>  help forums and threads. The best that I was able to surmise<br>  is that there is no definitive solution out there. However, there<br>  was one interesting factor in nearly everything I saw:...Firefox.<br>  <br>  A few people seemed to discover their own unique solution to<br>  this problem, but no one else was able to duplicate the same<br>  result. Also, each one of those apparent solutions was overly<br>  complicated and written in such bafflegab convoluted "techno-<br>  computerese" that I would not dream of recommending those<br>  potential fixes.<br>  <br>  However, I also did come across 4 somewhat easier possible<br>  solutions, so check these out:<br>  <br>  1) If you have a Mac and are using Firefox, apparently logging<br>  out of YouTube restores everything.<br>  <br>  2) One person found success by simply clicking the following:<br>  go to → Tools → Quick Preferences → Edit Site Preferences<br>  → Network tab → Browser Identification → Identify as Firefox.<br>  <br>  3) Three other people said all they needed to do was delete a<br>  program called "Gnash" (whatever that is).<br>  <br>  4) The last possibility is for you to double-check your internet <br>  connection if it's slow or weak -- because some people wrote <br>  that they always noticed "1 item remaining" in the bottom left <br>  corner of their browser screen.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that is all that I can realistically recommend to you. <br>  If you are interested in researching this subject matter further,<br>  please feel free to type any of these into Google's search box:<br>  -- youtube "blank screen"<br>  -- youtube "blank player"<br>  -- youtube "blank box"<br>  -- youtube "black screen"<br>  -- youtube "black player"<br>  -- youtube "black box"<br>  <br>  If nothing above does your thing, let me suggest what I advise<br>  so many other folks when YouTube goes slow, stuck or weird: <br>  Clear your "cache" of its "Cookies", "History" and "Temporary <br>  Internet Files". What I call my famous "CHTIF triple-cure" has <br>  solved 100's of people's YouTube problems, so why not yours.<br>  Simply do the following, then shutdown and reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options > Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  The only other ideas I can think of are Flash and Google Web<br>  Accelerator.

0ce618e63791d8565b35858c7ee73724aa	i agree...also i have a friend that does this..<br>  i dont mean to talk that badly about her but she isnt that attractive. so my guess is that the reason the girls show butts or boobs is because they believe they have nothing more really to offer besides sexual appeal. they want someone to notice them. particulary men. In fact, some men will actually add the girls just because they think that they will get lucky with them. If you notice most of the girls with these pictures have a lot of guy friends on their Myspaces. The pictures strike up conversations pretty easily. <br>  guys pointing guns thing...haha yea i agree they look psychodic not attactive. but i have 3 reasons to explain this. Some might actually be showing off their gun not themselves. another reason is yea they think that it makes them look like a bad ***. and finally it could be that these pics (like women putting up those pictures of their boobs and butts) will most likely strike up a conversation.|`|6W4ZWOetaa	This type of thing doesn't appeal to me either... but what makes human beings fabulous  is that we're all different.

I don't need to be half naked or anything for anyone. Most people these days just want attention, wanna look "hot" and wanna look "like a myspace whore". WOW, bearing yourself in a towel and taking a mirror reflection image of you in it whilst looking at the camera as if to say "want me?" really does show how much of an attention seeker and myspace whore you really are. Thats loud and clear, for sure. I usually wouldn't want to get to know someone who is like that with their pictures, it's just too fake for me. And the whole, "haterzzz aint got nuthin on me, i sh** all ovaaa myspacee nigg**zzz" thing is really, NOT COOL.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, girls in bikinis aren't that bad to me.

peFufWeYaa	I understand your question, and there is not a simple solution, but a free program called proxyway will do this. I do not recommend it because when you install it it integrates itself into your Firefox, and you must then run it when you run Firefox. Of course you can run it as a straight thru [no proxy] or with proxy. And it is really good at hunting down proxies and testing them and then you can configure your own list they way you want, as use anonymity on this site and not on others, etc<br>  <br>  But as the previous answer said, proxies are very unreliable. If it were me, I would use JAP, which is more reliable than the others, and I would use the one button proxy switch tool bar on Firefox and switch it manually, which is what I do now|`|WeZcSZvKaa	You can't because proxies change all the time.

This is quite common, in fact I would say nearly half of what you see on YouTube is rehashed stuff.<br>  <br>  But you should know this. When you download a clip, it will be flv [flash] and you cannot edit flash, or split flash, because it is too compressed. There are a few sites who will offer to download the clip for you and then give it to you in avi, because this is what you need. You need avi<br>  <br>  I would prefer not to use one of those sites as they will probably put their own watermark on it or whatever. I suggest you download the clip, preferably with downloader helper on Firefox, and then use free flv to avi converter below to convert it to avi, and then you can import it into Windows Movie Maker.<br>  <br>  But also you should know that if you start editing and playing with video and such, often your computer will not have the required codecs to even use avi. To cover this issue just download and install K-lite codecs and then you will be good to go

Many bring up the fact that Gimp Lacks CMYK but don't even know what it is or does.

FBQZ06vraa	That sounds like a trial version of Microsoft Office that was good for 25 uses or 60 days.  At the end of that time it stops letting you edit your files or create new ones.  You have to purchase Microsoft Office 2007, or at least Word 2007, to do that.<br>  <br>  Like being hooked like a fish, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Note:  The 25-character product key on the computer case or laptop bottom is NOT the key for MS Office.  It’s only for the Windows operating system.<br>  <br>  Here are some of your options:<br>  <br>  First, if you're a student, you may qualify for the Student edition of Office at a pretty good price:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/student/discounts/theultimatesteal-us/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...</a><br>  <br>  Second, if you’re interested in buying Word, check out this URL, especially the second group of listings. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/FX101754511033.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Note that the higher of the two prices quoted is for a full version of that program and the lower, for upgrades from existing software.  Read the list of upgrade-qualifying software carefully:  MS Works is often one, and may have come on your machine.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you have files that are locked up in the new Word 2007 file format (.docx), here’s a possibility for salvaging them.  Microsoft offers a free Compatibility pack that allows earlier versions of Word to read Word 2007 files.  If you have access to an earlier version, this can at least give you back your documents.  Some new features of Word 2007 will be lost or converted to straight text in the conversion to the earlier version.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10570173	What came with your computer was a trial version of Office.

OnssznPAaa	Whether or not you should upgrade or no depends purely on a number of things:-<br>  1. How much do you use Photoshop?<br>  2. How proficient are you with it?<br>  3. How powerful is the system you are running it on--and what OS are you working with?<br>  <br>  Let's take those in turn:-<br>  <br>  1. The later versions of Photoshop are more powerful than version 7--but that power comes at a price. They are also a lot more complicated to use, with tools having been moved/merged and generally messed about with in order to make room for the improvements made to the newer version. It's gonna take time to get used to that  new version.<br>  <br>  2. Regardless of how powerful those new versions are, that extra power is very much useless to you unless you know Photoshop and how to work with it productively. You're going to suffer slightly initially until you get used to the new layout/tooling in the new version, and you need to factor that loss of time into the equation.<br>  <br>  3. If you're working with anything less than 1Gb of Ram and an operating system earlier than Win2K, then my advice would be to stick exactly where you are. The later versions all a lot more memory hungry, and unless your hardware is up to the job, you won't see any benefit from moving versions.<br>  <br>  I don't want this to sound as if I'm trying to put you off upgrading--all I'm trying to do is point up the potential pitfalls you might not be aware of.<br>  <br>  Hope This of Help<br>  <br>  Scots

qRx3ynKdaa	The third panel in the status bar at the bottom of the OpenOffice.org Writer window contains the language in effect at the current cursor position. What does it say?<br>  <br>  If it says “[none]” then that is your problem. Or you may have the name of a language for which you have no dictionary. Note that OpenOffice.org considers English (USA), English (UK), English (Canada), English (Australia) and so forth to be separate languages since they don’t have the same spelling conventions.<br>  <br>  So first select Tools → Language → For all text, and select the language you want if it appears on the next item down. If it doesn’t appear, then select “More...” for a complete list of languages. Those with a blue check mark in front of them are languages for which you have dictionaries installed. If the language you want doesn’t have a blue check mark, then select Tools → Languages → More Dictionaries Online.... Hunt down any dictionaries you want and install them. Don’t just install them all. Too many dictionaries will slow down OpenOffice.org. You may just need an English Australian dictionary to be installed.<br>  <br>  If you now have the language you want installed, so that its name appears in the third panel of the status bar, and if that language has a blue check mark in front of it in the list, then all should be well.<br>  <br>  Normally documents should begin with the language that the menu is in, or the template is in. But if you began with a previous document, then it may already have a language setting and that language setting may be “[none]”. The “[none]” setting is useful for individual words or paragraphs that you don’t want be checked, such as an extended quotation from Mark Twain’s “Huckleberry Finn” or other dialect writing.<br>  <br>  Note that the above explanation is somewhat incomplete. One really wants to include language as part of the character attributes in a paragraph style or character style. Read up on styles in the Writer guide at <a href="http://documentation.openoffice.org/manuals/userguide3/" rel="nofollow">http://documentation.openoffice.org/manu...</a> .

rNA6x4r2aa	Well, most of the regular Mac mouses only physically have one button, so make sure your mouse has two buttons. After that, if you have the right drivers, the right click will work. Otherwise, you'll need to hold the weird flower shape button while pressing the mouse button.|`|AA10570173	Yes, you can get right clicking on an Apple mouse, as long as it's not a really old mouse. If it's an Apple Mighty mouse, it actually has several buttons, they just don't look like buttons. Go to the Apple logo in the upper left corner of your screen, click on System Preferences, then when the window comes up, click on Mouse and Keyboard, then select Mouse. You should see a diagram of the mouse. There will be a label pointing to the right top/front of your mouse. It is probably set to Primary, which means it acts like a left click button, which makes the mouse seem like it's only got one button. But if you click on that label and select Secondary, you now have a right button for your mouse, and you can right click just like on a PC. Also, if you want to use a PC mouse, unless it's some really fancy mouse with special drivers, all you have to do is plug it in and the Mac will recognize the right button on that mouse.|`|sD7d3Wgpaa	okay well i have these computers at school and it seems to me that all you have to do is hold the clicker down on what you want to right click on, but i am not sure if that is how they set it up or not check it out and see if it works, couldn't hurt...|`|uqwL9544aa	You can do one of the following.<br>  <br>  1.

I've never had any luck with Linksys. Some folks love them, and have no problems at all . Others, like me, have never had one that worked. I've owned two, and have used at least ten different ones at work. None of the ones I've used have been reliable.

Dfr6uA91aa	I'm guessing that you tried to open the file you downloaded right? Well that's not what you're supposed to do.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you installed TI-Connect correctly and it's able to detect your calculator.<br>  <br>  Well connect and turn on your calculator, then open TI-Connect. Open TI-DeviceManager. Now go to Tools > Explorer and then in the window that just opened, navigate to where you downloaded the file.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that the file you downloaded will either be .8xp, .8xk, .83p, or similar. If that's the case, then just drag the file from Windows Explorer into the TI-DeviceExplorer window, which then it should begin sending.<br>  <br>  As long as you have a TI-83 Plus, then you can download most files that are compatible. This includes all files beginning with .8x* or .83*. Other than what you have, there's nothing else you need to download.

eTLG23N4aa	One of the biggest problems with Vista when it was new was device driver support and because of that Vista did all of the bad things you heard about. Now that driver support is much better and Microsoft has fixed over 400 problems in Vista SP-1 it actually runs very well. Some older hardware and software programs won't work with Vista however.<br>  <br>  You need a high end video adapter to get the best appearance out of Vista as well at least 3 gigs of memory.<br>  <br>  XP is very good and stabile as we all know but it's becoming boring and obsolite. Driver support for some newer computers is not available for XP either.|`|plBN572qaa	on a scale of 1 to 10, i would rate it around a high 8, low 9<br>  <br>  i don't get why people are saying that vista sucks so badly, and that they'd rather have XP......they do know that XP will become obsolete, don't they? anyways, vista is simpler to use, but you also have to check out the help and support once in a while if you get lost or stuck<br>  <br>  btw, you can repeat a single song in windows media player if you drag and drop it into the list pane (so it'll be like iTunes, but only better ;))<br>  <br>  windows 7 i heard was just as "bad" as vista.....|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	It's very good, almost all problems are now fixed. It's far more better than XP because it's more secure and it doesn't have issues with new hardware as XP does. It is easier to use once you're used to it. It can't run some of the older software, but some of them have patches to make them work. People who hate Vista say many things like it's slow, but that's because they don't have the proper hardware for it. Some of them are bothered by the user account control, but that can be easily disabled in user account settings. Vista uses a lot of resources but there are some things you can do to get better performance, it could be as easy as turning off the windows aero theme. Good luck with whatever you choose.|`|W0GmSE0vaa	I honestly love Vista!

Like every product, there are pros and cons. I'm a current user of Vista, XP, Ubuntu, and Mac OS X and I can tell you about how I feel towards Vista.<br>  <br>  You mentioned "crashing all the time and constantly being updated". When Windows XP first came out, it also had all of these problems. But it wasn't until Service Pack 2 came out, most problems started to settle. Windows XP also lacked support for many Windows 98 programs.<br>  <br>  For an average user, you would find that Windows Vista is actually not too bad. I personally dislike all Microsoft products because of the way they do business: forcing people to use their products. I like the idea of freedom. If I want to do my word processing, I can use OpenOffice or Microsoft Office. I'm not locked down to one particular vendor just like if I was buying a car or house.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, Windows Vista is Microsoft's best OS to-date. It's much more visually pleasing and they've added a lot of good features. If you are buying a computer, you would want to keep ahead of technology. Why would you bother to waste your money on out-dated  products? Are you using any mission-critical software that absolutely must run on Windows XP? If you answer is no, then give Vista a try.|`|UuRbBUt3aa	vista is not a bad os at all cuz some people has to low ram, in xp only reconize 2.5 gb when vista can reconize 3.5gb . and it's more smooth. some people said it has compadable issue well u just need to find the hardware to reconize vista . in xp if one program crashes all program crashes in vista if one crashes it will pop up a qeustion do u want window to wait for that program or end it. vista is much better. if u dont like it wait till window 7 comes out.|`|880ec6527fe04278aef13b29d116c9d7aa	I'm running a Vista and XP PC, I can say that Vista isn't nearly as bad as I expected though!

Then you can install Vista using Boot Camp.<br>  <br>  Boot Camp doesn't run the operating system, it just helps you install it.  Once you install it, the operating system is running on its own, no Boot Camp assistance involved.  Its just as if you bought an IBM Clone with Windows installed in the first place.|`|BBnnSwK9aa	Can't be done.  "... it's possible to transfer Windows Vista from my sister's PC", unfortunately, is an example of illegal software "Piracy".<br>  <br>  Apple's Boot Camp only allows you to install a FULL legal version of XP or Vista.  And, "Upgrade disks" do NOT work, period.  So, expect to pay about $300.<br>  <br>  FYI:  I installed XP Pro and was delighted how well it ran on my Mac.  But, since I got more comfortable with OS X, I've hardly used XP.  The free Neo-Office, like MS-Office, made XP redundant for me:

Sometimes the kite will not pick up and fly through the air because it is not in the right wind, right? You can sometimes get a lot of speed up and the kite will fly.<br>  <br>  If you take off the casing of the laptop (as in, reveal the fan), you should be able to get the fan working again with very little trouble. The manual way is to blow on it until it picks up and registers movement.. and should restart. Sometimes you have to do it for a good 30 seconds to 2 minutes.. it has never taken me longer than that.. but I would encourage you to try for four minutes maximum and then take it to a computer shop.

HyWeOyT4aa	Yes, you can, and it is pretty easy to do. First, you need to make sure you have your system recovery discs (these either came with your computer, or you were required to burn a set). If you have not made them you need to do so. You will have to back up all the files you wish to keep. Tell me your OS and I will tell you the fastest/simplest way to do this. The recovery discs will restore your computer to the factory shipped version, just like the day you first turned it on. Ok, to change a laptops hard drive you take of the appropriate panel, then you take out a couple screws and take out the old one. The hard drive will be in a case, you will have to take the old one out of the case and insert the new one, also the connector will slide off the old and you put it on the new one. The only tool you need is a small phillips head screwdriver. Once you install the new hard drive you simply put the first recovery disc in and then follow the steps on the screen. Then you will need to update your drivers and install all the files and programs you wished to keep that you backed up. My advice to you is do not be intimidated, you can do this yourself and avoid paying someone like best buy a lot of money to do this. Just make sure you get a popular brand of hard drive from a trusted site, this way you will have a good warranty, and they will provide service for you.

But I think your main problem is the comparison operator check. You must match a variable to a value every time, there are no shortcuts. It would also help to lower case the matches:<br>  <?php<br>  // Assign the post data to a variable<br>  // Set search value to lower case<br>  $search = strtolower($_POST['search']);<br>  <br>  // Check for matches<br>  if (($search == "utah") || ($search == "maine"))<br>  {<br>      echo "Utah or Maine";<br>  }<br>  else if (($search == "nigeria") || ($search == "saudi arabia"))<br>  {<br>      echo "Nigeria or Saudi Arabia";<br>  }<br>  else<br>  {<br>      echo "ERROR 1";<br>  }<br>  ?><br>  <br>  Checking to see if the variable is set is kind of useless. You could also use a case structure for this to make more organized code:<br>  <?php<br>  // Assign the post data to a variable<br>  // Set search value to lower case<br>  $search = strtolower($_POST['search']);<br>  <br>  // Check for matches using switch statement<br>  switch($search)<br>  {<br>      case "utah":<br>      case "maine":<br>          echo "Utah or Maine";<br>      break;<br>  <br>      case "nigeria":<br>      case "saudi arabia":<br>          echo "Nigeria or Saudi Arabia";<br>      break;<br>  <br>      // Else an error occured<br>      default:<br>          echo "ERROR 1";<br>  }<br>      <br>  <br>  Makes for much neater and organized code using the switch statement. I hope this solves your problem. Overall though, I don't know what your real problem was and I don't know what that included file was  doing so I gave you some pointers.|`|UMSYOb03aa	Why the hell would you code in PHP or watever its bloody caled|`|bVHnNqzBaa	What error are you getting?

bTPjYIvyaa	Facebook does a pretty good job of screening apps and their platform is fairly rigid in what you can or can't do however, my educated guess is that at worst, it can gather a ton of information. Once the app has been approved by you, it should be able to see you, where you live and whatever other info you have publicly available. Plus it can see who you are friends with and once you pass it on to someone else, it get's their data, down the line.  What it could possibly do with that data, it's anyone's guess.  Maybe market other facebook apps?  In general, you shouldn't put anything on facebook or myspace or where ever that you are not comfortable sharing with the entire planet, even if they say "your information is protected."

Open source software is inherently safe because of the number of people involved. If there were viruses or whatnot contained in Frostwire, the hundreds of other developers would see it, and I doubt they'd let it slide.<br>  <br>  It's the crap you download off the Gnutella P2P network using Frostwire that you should be cautious with. Remember, Frostwire has nothing to do with the crap you download using Frostwire.|`|IzCCoKNoaa	FrostWire description   <br>   <br>   <br>  A free offspring from LimeWire to create a Gnutella client that does not filter any content<br>  FrostWire is a free Gnutella client based on LimeWire distributed under terms of the GPL. It was created in September 2005 after LimeWire LLC received a cease and desist letter.<br>  <br>  FrostWire is a useful file sharing utility that gives you the possibility to transfer files from and to your computer. <br>  <br>  The LimeWire open-source community then decided to create FrostWire, - a free offspring using the publicly available sourcecode from LimeWire to create a Gnutella client that does not filter any content.<br>  <br>  Note: Some antivirus and antispyware programs flag FrostWire as being infected/malware, although the application is perfectly safe and does not pose a threat to your system. This is called a 'false positive'. The term false positive is used when antivirus software wrongly classifies an innocuous ( inoffensive ) file as a virus. The incorrect detection may be due to heuristics or to an incorrect virus signature in a database. [Similar problems can occur with antitrojan or antispyware software.]<br>  <br>  Here are some key features of "FrostWire":<br>  <br>  · Completely free & open-source<br>  · Firewall-to-firewall transfers<br>  · Built-in community chat<br>  · No bundled software of any kind!<br>  · Connects to more sources<br>  · Creative commons license support<br>  · Max. speed network connections<br>  · Junk result filters<br>  · Turbo-Charged download speeds<br>  · iTunes integration<br>  · BitTorrent support<br>  · Proxy Support<br>  <br>  <br>  Requirements:<br>  <br>  · 64 MB RAM (128 MB RAM recommended)<br>  · A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.5<br>  · A live connection to the Internet<br>  <br>  <br>  What's New in This Release: [ read full changelog ]<br>  <br>  · Fixes a newly introduced bug in Windows which would make FrostWire(tm) take over the .bittorrent file association without asking the user.<br>  · Reduces DHT network load. The LimeWire team found out that the Mojito “store forwarding” feature would not provide extra data availability, so it’s been turned off from the DHT on all new FrostWires.<br>  · FrostWire.ico has been updated. Now when FrostWire(tm) is associated to .bittorrent files, .bittorrent files will use the FrostWire(tm) icon.<br>  <br>  <br>  Reasons why this program is marked as adware:<br>  <br>  · The application is trying to install ASK Toolbar, and is trying to change your default home page to ASK Home.

They had 300 workstations and 20 servers, nearly all of which had become infected by the time we convinced them to shut everything down.  It took a team of 10 folks working around the clock all weekend long to figure out what had hit, and how to disinfect the network.  It took 2 full days of fighting with 3 anti-virus vendors to convince them that it was a new version of an old worm and get anti-virus defs written to stop the spread.|`|d76c8d33b2fa45010f77253df845d65eaa	hmm that appears to be an attack on your network,, is this happening on multiple desktops?,,,, leads me to believe the IT dept is null, or dumb,,, they need to have firewall rules.. proxy server... content filters and the like protecting u guys... throw ur keyboard @ the CTO ,,, their lacking,,, this would never have happend under my companies watch ... ::hint:: lol j/p but dude,,, u guys are burnt,, no reboot won't help,, it may make it worst,, u need a first responders team to clear the infections and implement defense... <br>  <br>  ;...<     <br>  <br>  ^ crying for ur network|`|2CiPsRGhaa	Yes, you likely have been infected.<br>  <br>  Shutting down the computer would help prevent the spread of the possible infection.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.net/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.net/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

AbRfd29Haa	A computer virus is basically the same idea as random pranking or vandalism, depending on the severity They're usually written by kids trying to make a name for themselves. Somewhat less commonly, they're also written by disgruntled workers, maybe with the idea of getting back at a particular company.. but it's pretty easy to see thing things spreading quickly. However, a few of these were written with good intent... research, or just to let people know about security holes. <br>  <br>  A computer virus is modeled on the real thing. A real virus infiltrates a cell, injects its own DNA and makes that cell create new copies of itself. In the process, the cell dies. A computer virus infiltrates a computer program (usually though some action of the user, such as opening an unknown file which turns out to be some form of executable), it runs on the computer and gets that computer to make copies of itself, in an effort to affect others. <br>  <br>  Early virus writers were really just trying to do some clever hack... some of these didn't intentionally do any damage, maybe just some kind of prank. But occasionally they did anyway, due to bugs that caused infected systems to crash. Others have some bad intent along with the goal of self-replication... there have been virus programs which, for example, erased all your JPEG photo files. <br>  <br>  The generic term "malware" is applied to this class of programs that does some kind of disservice to the user, and generally sneaks onto a user's system. To be a virus, its only necessary characteristic is the self-replication and attachement to other programs. The closely related "worm" self-replicates, but works without the need to infiltrate other programs. A "spyware" program, by contrast, is hiding on your computer, sending personal information of some kind to the authors. A "zombie" will, rather, attempt to use your computer's horsepower for someone else's purposes.|`|3otJW39Naa	Computer viruses are not mistakes like living viruses, they are made by hackers who have the intent to destroy, hack, or just mess with another computer. These are made by hackers and what these hackers do is HIGHLY illegal as it can cause damage to many computers. <br>  <br>     Viruses are sent mainly through e-mails that have tempting documents attached to them, when you open the document it downloads the virus to your computer and BAM! your whole operating system has been bugged.

ywejEjm7aa	If you want you robot to be fully autonomous, and you are not going to use x86 as a processor, you can't use Matlab. I do 99% of image processing with matlab and it is exactly what I need. Last 1% is done with C (+CUDA). Image processing in Matlab is easy because of very good function support and easy to use matrix indexing.<br>  <br>  I haven't used OpenCV, but I have feeling that it would be best for professional use because I have feeling that it is the fastest of these four. But I don't think that it is the easiest. Also I dont think that C is as good language as M-code or Python for rapid developing (searching the right answer through trial and error).<br>  <br>  I don't know how much you can do image processing with Java, but personally I would use something else (I have some kind of fear for Java).<br>  <br>  This is first time I heard about Roborealm and therefore I cannot say anything about it, but I would like to add fifth candidate: Python. You can use Python almost as you would use Matlab and it should be as fast or even faster in processing speeds.

HyWeOyT4aa	Start, all programs, then recovery manager. I have vista but if I remember correctly it's the same eon XP. Before you do a system recovery I recommend you do a system restore first, start, all programs, accessories, system tools, then system restore. Just pick a date that you know you were not having any problems. Also if you have any real time protection software such as norton antivirus you need to disable it because it will prevent you from doing a system restore. If you end up having to do a system recovery make sure you back up your programs and files because you will lose everything, it will be EXACTLY like the day you turned it on for the first time. Some viruses will prevent a system recovery using the partition on your HDD, and will prevent a system restore. In this case you will need your recovery discs, these either came with your computer or you were required to burn a set using the recovery manager.<br>  <br>  I've not used XP in a while. Go to start, accessories, system tools, see if it is there. It may be named something else, look for something in there with recovery in it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I had the antivirus that you have once, and had the same problem with it not removing viruses. Download malwarebytes anti-malware and it should remove your virus. Update the program as soon as you download it so it will detect new threats. This program removed my stubborn virus when the other would not and it is free. A safe place to download it from is www.download.com it is number 6 in the most popular downloads section.<br>  <br>  <br>  OK I figured out where it is. Go to accessories then under system tools you should see 'backup' there is an option in there to do what you want to do.

The upgrade program concerns upgrade paths from Windows Vista to Windows 7, and basically entails that when you buy a Windows Vista machine after July 1 2009, you will get a free upgrade to Windows 7 once it's released. The data also confirm a number of versions for Windows 7.<br>  If you buy a machine preloaded with Windows Vista after July 1st 2009, you will be eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 7 once it's released. There are a number of restrictions, though; you are not allowed to upgrade from one language to another. In addition, the only upgrade paths allowed within the program are from Vista Home Premium to Windows 7 Home Premium, Business to Professional, and Ultimate to Ultimate. All other paths are not allowed; people who buy Vista Starter or Vista Home Basic are not eligible for upgrades, for instance. <br>  <br>  The dates are not final yet, so they are subject to change. What they do confirm, however, is that we will see at least four versions of Windows 7; the ones mentioned above, and an enterprise edition. <br>  <br>  In other words, for those of us who had hoped for a simple home/professional divide, forget it.|`|3trxV8bhaa	Yes, you can upgrade to 7 from Vista|`|TIvdCg2taa	It may not be possible...
d3b8d95f3c206880dff89e3a0ed42336aa	There is never really an answer to longevity as is would depend on lots of things like how much you use the printer as well as luck of the draw.  All printers have to last for a least a year or they have to be replaced or repaired.<br>  <br>  Lexmark printers are ink guzzlers. All printers are expensive to run but my personal opinion is that Canon are the better manufacture of printers in general.  I have not owed the Canon model you stated but I have two other Pixma ones and I'm very happy with them both.<br>  <br>  The answer to which is best general boils down to what you use the printer for. Say if you print mostly text then X model may be ideal but if you print a lot of pictures it may not be that great for you and Y printer is better.  <br>  <br>  I would say write a list of things you will normally be printing and list them in order of importance.  Then try to match the printer that best suits those requirements.  Look for some reviews that are not done by the manufacturer but an independent source. These reviews usually try all the features out and then report the results.  Printers are indeed a mine field and there are so many that picking the right one is nigh on impossible.

Sorry.<br>  <br>  You have a few choices however:<br>  1. Compressing the harddrive. It makes the files smaller and gives you more space. But each file takes longer to open as it has to be "uncompressed" to run, slowing your system. Right click on the harddrive, you should see the option there under Properties.<br>  <br>  2. Buying another, second harddrive. Your computer probably has an empty slot that will allow you to connect a second harddrive, in which case you can just add more "stuff" to it.<br>  <br>  My other suggestion is to go through your Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs, and Uninstall everything that you don't use often.<br>  <br>  Then, run a program like Advanced System Care from Download.com which will delete a lot of junk that the computer creates but never deletes once it's unnecessary.|`|fgbZugDlaa	It is definitely possible to increase disc space, but this is not through hacking.<br>  <br>  The common way to do this is called "Hard Drive Compression" and it will condense the data, which makes data transfer slower overall.<br>  <br>  Get a "For Dummies" PC book, as your basic understanding and terminology isn't where it should be.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  You ask about hacking a hard drive, which is the wrong terminology and when told to get a book to brush up on such things, you take offense and give a thumbs down?|`|AA11485682	No. You can buy a larger hard drive though and have it installed.

AA11434745	In Java, the term "extends" basically means, "Using the model of Class A, make Class B. But change the way Class B works, either by giving it new properties, methods and events, or by changing the way its properties, methods or events work in comparison to Class A."<br>  <br>  For example, suppose you have a class named Class A. This is the "base" class, the model from which you will make Class B.<br>  <br>  When you declare Class B, you state that it extends Class A.<br>  <br>  What that says to Java is, "Make Class B an exact copy of Class A. Class B will have all the properties, events and methods that exist in Class A."<br>  <br>  Now, you could add additional properties to Class B. For example, suppose Class A has a property, named Color. Maybe you want to get even more detailed in Class B. So you create a property named  Location, and one named Height, and one named Width. <br>  <br>  Those properties won't exist in Class A; they'll only exist in Class B. But because Class B is basically a clone of Class A, even though you didn't specifically say in Class B that you have a Color property, it exists in Class B.<br>  <br>  That's an example of creating new properties, methods and events in a subclass via extends. Another thing you can do, with both extends and super, is change how things work in Class B, versus the way they work in Class A.<br>  <br>  Let's suppose Class A has a method called Save(). Suppose that method sends a document to the common dialog to be saved. <br>  <br>  Maybe, in Class B, you want it to work exactly like Class A. The only difference is, Class B actually works with remote data. You don't want to save Class B's work on a local hard drive; you want to transmit it to a remote server over the Internet.<br>  <br>  Well, there's no need to rewrite the entirety of Class A into Class B. You simply create Class B as an extension of Class A.

There are many branches to a hierarchy and it looks like an upside down tree.<br>  <br>  Java classes have a "hierarchy" with Object as the very top and all other classes rank below. For an example, Number ranks below Object, and Integer ranks below Number. This hierarchy cannot change and it's important to know the hierarchy of your classes.<br>  <br>  To understand "inheritance", we refer to 2 other Java terms: parent and child. Think of the parent class as the class higher up in the hierarchy and the child class ranks below it. <br>  <br>  You always start higher up the hierarchy classes first and lower classes are created later. In our example classes, you have to have the Number class before we can create the Integer class. So to create the Integer class which is a specific type of Number, we want to use what is already in the Number class instead of programming everything over again. To tell the program that the Integer class will use the Number class as a template and make it below the Number in the hierarchy, we use the key word "extends"--the Integer class "extends" from the Number class.<br>  <br>  Once that happens, like how a human child inherits his parent's things, the Integer class (child) will get, or "inherit", all the properties and methods of the parent class, which is the Number class. That's inheritance.<br>  <br>  I don't know if the "super" key word is really used in the Integer class, but for this explanation, assume that it does. When a child class "inherits" all the methods from the parent Number class, you can program a new version of that method with the same name in the Integer class. This is called "overriding" a parent method. <br>  <br>  So your child class has a new method with the same name as an inherited method from the parent. If you want to refer to the parent or the parent's method, that's when you use the "super" key word. <br>  It's just a key word to refer to the parent above the child in the hierarchy.
AbRfd29Haa	There are things you can try, but 802.11 is only so good indoors, particularly in a metal building. <br>  <br>  First thing to try -- try re-orienting your antennas. Antennas radiate best along their length, not at the end, so ensure the antenna is normal to (at right angles to) your work area floor. <br>  <br>  In addition... particularly in a metal building, you're going to have multipath issues. That's when a signal bounces, and you get multiple versions of your signal at your antenna at the same time, but out of phase -- so they may distort, or cancel outright. The dual antennas on the WRT54G are designed to work around multipath -- this works best when both are the same distance from your system (rather than in-line, for example, though both senarios can actually work). <br>  <br>  Another option is to use larger antennas. The "rubber duck" antennas supplied with your WRT54G have a gain of about 2dBi. You can get a higher gain antenna, which will extend the range noticably. It also makes antenna orientation more critical, and will cut the range above and below you, so if you're running this RF link between floors, this might not be a good idea. See here: <a href="http://www.fab-corp.com/product.php?productid=3069&cat=250&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.fab-corp.com/product.php?prod...</a><br>  <br>  You could try relocating your WRT54G closer to your computer. If it's also being used as a hub, you might replace it with a hub, then run one CAT-5 cable between that hub and the WRT54G.... ideally, making it more centrally located, assuming your're not the only wireless user. <br>  <br>  You could add a repeater, such as the WRE54G. Place such a device where it can hear the router, and it'll send on a stronger signal to your computer. <br>  <a href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/products/WRE54G" rel="nofollow">http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/prod...</a><br>  <br>  If you know your way around open source, you can try OpenWRT or similar open source operating systems for the WRT54G (check that your version supports this). Many of the open source systems for routers enable higher power output from the router, which would buy you some more distance. <br>  <br>  That's all I got right now.|`|XXyc6t6oaa	Buy or make a cantenna<br>  Buy<br>  <a href="http://www.cantenna.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cantenna.com/</a><br>  <br>  Make<br>  <a href="http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/canten...</a>|`|XvkNaQWgaa	I would recommend either moving closer to your router, or moving your router closer to you.

GlHHz1ehaa	Virtual DJ, as the other person said, is one of the top notch DJ softwares. It is available for Mac and PC. Although it is top notch, it might also be the most user friendly DJ software out there. You don't need turn tables and a mixer to use it. You simply need a computer and mouse. You can scratch, mix, and even record beats to later save in iTunes. Professional DJs use this software. It is defiantly one of the best DJ softwares out there. It runs at about $200 for the professional version. There are different versions you can buy. If you are looking at recording beats and just doing that, not doing live shows at bars or concerts, then I would suggest buying the beginner or non professional version unless you have $200 in the pocket. The program assumes you know something about DJing like loops, tempo mixtures, and other things like wave forms. If not, it is still as good because there are two decks and in each deck there is a button that is called "Sync". It is the most powerful button because all you need to do is have one track playing and another waiting in the other deck. Click play and then Sync and the two will sync and you will have a beat already made and playing. I would recommend this software to a beginner or professional.

You are just a BIT off.<br>  <br>  Unix is an operating system. <br>  <br>  Mac OS is BASED off of BSD, which is a derivative of Unix.<br>  <br>  Sun OpenSolaris is a derivative of an older version of Unix.<br>  <br>  Ubuntu is a distribution of Linux, which is *heavily* based on Unix.

k4oWc9QCaa	I think it would depend on yourself.  Have you ever worked in any design software like Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, After Effects, and so on?  If so, then it would be somewhat easy to catch on.  Also, if you are familiar with HTML or CSS would be great.  While Dreamweaver lets you design webpages without coding, it is still useful to have that background.  Try to find materials to aid you in learning the software.  Adobe usually sends a tutorial DVD with the software.  Magazines in the field (like Layers) are wonderful and can be found at Barnes and Noble or any other bookstores.  Try books like Teach Yourself Visually Dreamweaver CS3 (that is the one that I have).  I bought mine from Alibris.com for only ten bucks.  You can also check out video tutorials from YouTube by doing a search.  And of course, web design sites that help you, like BoogieJack or W3 Schools.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6W4ZWOetaa	It's about as hard as actually learning to code with HTML.

The car was then driven around every street in the country (huge job!!!) and pictures taken at regular intervals and matched to the GPS position.

The computer registry becomes more complex as you use your computer. The more programs you use the greater the chance your<br>  computer registry will develop errors and become bloated over time. Without cleaning the registry on a regular basis it is very likely that your PC will freeze.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the Windows registry improves the performance of your computer and will reduce the number of PC freezes.

If you have problems downloading or installing the malware removal tools please send an email to me and I will give you a step by step advice to fix this. Malware tends to block the download and installation of anti-virus and anti-spyware programs and websites. I recommend scanning in safe mode because a lot of times safe mode disables malware but this is not totally accurate. You can access safe mode by tapping F8 when your computer restarts, make sure to go into safe mode with networking to update the malware removal tools. I also recommend turning off system restore because users can restore their PC back to an infected state. You can do this by right clicking my computer, select properties, select system restore, and select turn off system restore.<br>  Update and do a quick scan with Malwarebytes and a full scan with Superantispyare to get rid of any malware that is installed on your PC. I recommend doing a scan with only one of these tools at a time because there may be complications. Once the removal process is finished restart your computer and turn system restore back on.

h0hSIgC1aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  it may possible to manually set the FSB of the CPU to make it 1333<br>  <br>  go into the BIOS and look for "frequency control", there is a entry called "CPU Clock", this is the core FSB - a quick explaination<br>  <br>  let's say you have an e2180 which is 2ghz @ 800FSB, the core clock is 800/4=200Mhz and the mulitplier is 10x (since 10x200=2000Mhz)<br>  <br>  The e8400 is 3Ghz @ 1333FSB so 1333/4=333Mhz and the multi is 3000/333=9x<br>  <br>  So just set your "CPU Clock" manually to 333, since it supports 1066 it may only detect 266 in there and the E8400 will only run at 266*9=2400Mhz=2.4Ghz<br>  <br>  If you can manually put in 333 for the core clock then you are all set.  And of course, you will need at least DDR2-667 or higher to support it since I do not see a memory multiplier setting.<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers|`|k5KuYkkKaa	Buy more fans.

These programs detect all of the examples you have mentioned.|`|cm4oW9lZaa	Once again, stop giving bogus answers.<br>  <br>  It doesn't block every single "Virus, rootkit, malware, adware, etc" existing. There is a thing called binding and hexing, hexing can get a Trojan below its actual form. So lets say 96% of anti-viruses block this certain Trojan, they can hex it and make it go below that meaning this Trojan couldn't be identified in an actual case, but if they "scan" this on stuff like virustotal the Anti-Viruses which caught the Trojan will pass it on to the ones who didn't. That is why if I was to create a Trojan, I would be careful with the scanning.<br>  <br>  So yeah. Its not that hard to bind a file and execute. Or even hex it.|`|xe1NoWUNaa	Does not protect from spy ware' malware' root kits' ad ware' trojans' dialers' keyloggers worms' parasites or hijackers.

If free is the best you can do get AVIRA. It has a better detection rate' 94% compared to Avasts 86%. It's protection rate is better to. 86 % to AVAST 76%.

TyJuZnZhaa	Jesus Christ I can't imagine how difficult your problem is...<br>  <br>  Um, have you tried rendering the segments that make up the 1st side of the split screen into one file and the same to the other side of the split screen? <br>  <br>  (Like, merging all the segments of one part together using the rendering option. I think you'd do this by using the time line.)<br>  <br>  From my experience with editing software, if I had a bunch of segments of one single part that I had edited I would render all the segments into one file then put it back on the timeline and edit whatever else I wanted to edit about it.<br>  <br>  Like:<br>  <br>  Say I have 5 files and they're all pieces to one single thing that I wanted to edit. So, instead of editing each segment one by one, I'd just render all the segments together and then use that whole segment and edit it by its self.<br>  <br>  In your case:<br>  <br>  You need to pull down all the segments of one side of the split screen and then render them all as one. Do the same to the other segments of the other side of the split screen.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS. If you don't know what rendering is, it's done by dragging all your clips into the storyline then clicking "File" and then clicking, "Save Movie File."<br>  <br>  Err, sorry if this was a lot to read.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.net/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.net/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

K3tSo2smaa	No, registry cleaners are _not_ a scam. They _can_ and do improve system performance.<br>  <br>  However, not always as much as people want you to believe. It's a good idea to run a registry cleaner quite frequently, but defragmenting your hard drive will boost the performance of your computer much more.<br>  <br>  Here are some links to my personal favorite registry cleaner, and a simple one click defragmenter.<br>  <br>  Registry Cleaner: <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/download" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/download</a><br>  <br>  Single Click Defragmenter: <a href="http://www.kessels.com/Jkdefrag/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kessels.com/Jkdefrag/</a><br>  <br>  Both are 100% freeware.

It is effectively in my opinion, snake oils. The whole industry of registry cleaners was born out of dubious adverts of claims that it can improve the performance of your computers, there is no evidence to back that up.<br>  <br>  "Slowdown due to registry bloat is thus far less of an issue in modern versions of Windows. More importantly, however, the difference in speed due to the use of a registry cleaner is negligible: rarely do they remove more than a few kilobytes from the total size of the registry. In fact, technology journalist Ed Bott has claimed that no-one has ever successfully managed to measure any significant performance increase from the use of a registry cleaner."<br>  <br>  The real performance ehancers are already on Windows, they are Disk Defragment, Add/Remove (for removing needless programs), Startup (again to remove needless programs from Startup) and Disk Cleanup. Use those, and you'll find your computer performing faster. But in essence, registry cleaners will not enhance the performance of your computer.<br>  <br>  Some claim that registry cleaners remove the gunk leftover from uninstalled programs, again that claim is questionable.  Remnants in the registry from uninstalled programs like AVG can not be removed by using registry cleaners, it can be removed by using their own removal tool.<br>  <br>  You see, there are so many myths floating about on the net, and are often sprouted from blogsites, forums and so on. They perpetuate the myths so strongly, that the myths become embedded and very difficult to overcome.  For instance, I got thumbs down for saying this.|`|AA11232283	imo they're great ways of cleaning up old/uninstalled programs and directories within the registry, helping to speed up day to day processes as a result. i recommend TuneUp Utilities 2009; it has a great reg cleaner plus hundreds more options to fine-tune your OS

Probably that is what you meant. A CD Drive shouldn't disappear all of a sudden unless there is a hardware fault and/or Windows is not able to detect it. CD drives unlike most other hardware do not require drivers so it cannot be a driver related issue. Is there something different you did today? Maybe changed a setting or two from the Control Panel....

A Mac user will be replacing his computer half as often as a PC user.  Do the math.  Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>    b) How many times have you bought a PC with the idea of going somewhere to buy the hardware necessary to upgrade it?  The only thing I add when I bring a new Mac home is memory, which I get cheaper from someone other than Apple.  Do the math.  Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>  <br>  2) "Everyone" uses Windows.<br>    a) Gee.  Isn't that nice.<br>    b) If "Everyone" uses Windows, why are we having this conversation?<br>    c) Just because it is "popular" does nor mean it is a good thing.  Hula Hoops, pet rocks, Tomakachi, etc were all popular at one time.  Popular does have a long standing and is not a standard by which to judge the usefulness of a product.<br>  <br>  3) Windows is better for gaming than Macs.<br>    a) True, but if the people who keep saying this truly stood by the logic of what is the better system from games, they would instead say something like, "don't listen to those idiots who say Macs suck at games.  Get yourself a game console like PS2 or Xbox.  A game console is better at games than Windows."  But they aren't saying that are they?  What good is their advice is they can't stand by it themselves?<br>  <br>  4) There isn't enough software for the Mac.<br>  a) With the exception of games (read #3), there is no type of software application available for Windows that is not available for the Mac.  While you may not find a Macintosh version of an application made by the same company for some products, you will still find selects for the same task.<br>  b) Volume?  Yes, there is a large number of selections for Windows than for the Mac, but walk down the aisle and see how much of that selection is crap and/or outdated (and discounted) software.  Take that software out of the pictures and the gap narrows considerably.<br>  <br>  5) There isn't enough hardware for the Mac.<br>  a) Like the software misinformation, hardware selection for the Mac is lesser in number, but not as it is for software.  Hardware is not OS specific.  It is driver controlled.  A couple weeks of coded and testing will create a driver for the Mac OS.  Most companies are willing to take the time and expense of doing this.  Based on my experience, it is the crap hardware that usually does not have Mac drivers.  This is because the manufacturer knows that crap hardware does not have a future among Mac users.  We won't buy it.<br>  <br>  6) Macs are gay!<br>  a) This is so sophomoric, it's hard t respond to.  Why take advice from someone who would think this is an intelligent argument?  'nuff said.<br>  <br>  7) Software written for Windows will not run on a Mac.<br>  a) Software written the Mac will no run in Windows.  I guess by this logic, you can't buy a computer at all.<br>  b) Well, not exactly.  While there is no [legal] way to run the Mac OS in Windows, you can use Boot Camp or Parallels to run Windows on a Mac, which means you can run Windows software on a Mac.  But this is not a good reason to get a Mac, as getting away from Windows is one of the reasons to use a Mac.<br>  <br>  8) Windows 7 is coming out soon and will be better than Vista.<br>  a) Windows 7 is essentially an improved version of Vista.  Microsoft decided to remove the Vista name plate to increase sales.  If it doesn't say Vista, then it isn't Vista.  Buyers will think it is better.<br>  b) Only Windows ME was worse than what it replaced.  While Windows 7 is likely to be better than Vista.  This does not mean that it will be better than Mac OS.  This argument compares Windows to Windows, not Windows to the Mac.  What value does this argument have?<br>  <br>  9) Mac are for multimedia.<br>  a) Yes, there are.<br>  b) Macs are for web browsing, video editing, photo editing, audio editing, word processing, blogging, email, home work, writing, research, and everything else you might want to do with a home computer.<br>  <br>  10) Macs are for idiots.<br>  a) Let me translate:  "Macs are easier to use than PC's, so that must be designed for stupid people, right?"  Tom Hanks, Stephen Speilberg, Buss Aldin, Martha Stewart, the late Bris Yelsin, Malcom Forbes, Jr, Richard Dawkins, Tom Clancy, Scott Adams, Trent Reznor, The Rolling Stones, Bono, Conan O'Brien, Jerry Seinfeld, Rush Limbaugh, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and Tim Allen, must all be idiots.  But I'm sure that anyone can compile a list of smart people who use Windows.  The intelligence of the user is not correlated with their choice of computer.  This argument is either driving by the low intelligence of the person saying it, or but "sure grapes".<br>  <br>  11) You can't upgrade a Mac.<br>  a) I have no idea where this lie comes from.  Yes, you can upgrade a Mac.  Thing is, why would you need to upgrade your Mac?  With the possible exception of Memory, the Mac come fully loaded.  And for most people, the Mac comes with enough Memo|`|HyWeOyT4aa	Nowhere, you shouldn't. They are overpriced. Not expensive (which they are) but overpriced.

gtK7DU3Maa	Spam are unwanted emails in your inbox. For example, you get emails from unknown sender that you have won a lottery of 10 million or similar messages like you have got a job, download this anti-virus for free etc. These messages are harmful to computer because they may be containing virus (Or sometimes specially designed to be harmful). Now when you click this message, virus start spreading into your computer, take control of your computer and hang it and ultimately you need to format it (Sometime even good antivirus software won't work). Some more smart virus can obtain your contacts from windows contact book and then send this message to each of your contacts with 'from' field showing your mailid. so, your friends would think that you have sent it (And thus from trustworthy source) and would download your message and this way his/her computer will also get infected.

fgbZugDlaa	I would say that the cores are going to be utilized more than the RAM in most situations.<br>  <br>  You can not use more than 4GB of RAM unless you have a 64-Bit OS, keep that in mind.  A 32-Bit OS is compatible with Dual and Quad Core processors.  <br>  <br>  AMD makes a great product and your average person won't be able to tell the difference between an Intel and AMD processor in use.  An AMD Phenom Quad Core system with 4GB of DDRII is going to be much less expensive than an Intel Quad Core system with 4GB of DDRIII, as Intel has used DDR3 as a standard for a while now, while AMD just moved to a DDR-platform with Phenom II, though the Phenom II is completely DDR2 compatible, which will extend the life of the DDR2 platform.|`|MpTA1UOfaa	AMD vs. Intel<br>  Well, if you have extra money to spend(couple hundred) go for Intel, they are faster, more effecient, and better for overclocking.<br>  AMD is a good brand if you are looking for a budget system.I myself have an AMD system, and i can;t complain its is nice, and really fast.<br>  <br>  4 CORES vs. 2 CORES<br>  Only get 4 if you do a lot of multitasking, other than that, go for dual core, they are cheaper, and they usually run programs faster than quads becuase of the higher ghz.<br>  <br>  4GIGS vs. 8GIGS <br>  if you are a normal user, gaming, some video editing, sound, andything mainstream get 4.<br>  If you are a Pro. photographer, or editor get 8, other than that 8 if major overkill.|`|RCZhENqAaa	Err a lot of things have changed:<br>  1.

The reason I am suggesting this is because nothing else is happening, there are no beeps from the computer and if it was a PSU it would probably only go "on" intermittently,   The graphics card is one of the first devices that initiates when you press the power button, and if you are not getting any display it is most likely, usually with most other problems the Power On Self Test (POST) would still display and throw up some sort of error.    Easy to fix, just go to a pc shop and buy a graphics card (if you know the interface your current card has (PCI-E, AGP) and pull the old one out, put the new one, its pretty simple but if you are not confident take it to a pc repair shop... - Daz    Oh yeah and if you are in the pc have a look at the mobo check there are no blown capacitors on it (you will see the silver foil head is raised higher than the others or it could be leaking electrolite) if caps are blown that can cause a similar problem but some can below and work fine.|`|YVXuLLKVaa	1. dead power supply (or one of the voltages)  2. dead processor  3. dead VIA (one of the support chips)  4. dead low RAM

peFufWeYaa	Most proxies will not allow cookies or java, at least not most anonymous ones, because after all you are trying to be anonymous. What you want to do is search for an anonymous proxy which allows java script, as this seems to be the type of problem you are having. I posted a few below as an example.<br>  <br>  But I can tell you that in any event, trying to upload thru a proxy is not always possible, though I have done it once or twice. It just isn't easy, because of issues with bandwidth and such, you can frequently get kicked from a proxy, or your connection will suffer interruptions. When an interruption occurs, Youtube will reset your connection and you will have to start over. Sometimes Firefox fireuploader will buffer this sort of thing, but it will be a headache no matter what.<br>  <br>  But as for logging one and leaving comments and everything else, a proxy can work fine. I use them all the time because many of my friends channels are banned in the United States. Don't you just love YouTube? I mostly use a standalone proxy called JAP, because it is most convenient and I use switch proxy tool bar on Firefox to turn it on and off.

AA12180617	as previous comments  you are confusing partitioning with formatting but your question as to the 'missing 30GB' has a different answer remember 1 300GB drive is 300,000,000,000 Bits  as disk makers use Decimal in making drive but the computer accesses it in Binary. 300GB in binary is 322,122,547,200 Bits.<br>  therefore by definition a nominal 300GB disk has only 279.40 GB of Binary space on it.<br>  <br>  Take off space needed for partitioning then space for formatting then you have only around 270GB left.<br>  <br>  Your 30GB missing in NORMAL because of this inconsistency.<br>  <br>  FAT32 can only format files up to 20GB and NTFS allows for Terra bytes so for this size of disk to use all you have 2 choices..<br>  <br>  Partition it into several 20GB partitions each FAT32 at 31.999GB each  or format it as s single or dual partition and use NTFS for the formatting.<br>  <br>  neither way will change the usable space but formatting NTFS will allow for larger logiacal drive seize and so need feewer partitions|`|lySpS7kQaa	The old FAT32 (File Allocation Table) file system was developed originally for MS-DOS on small machines and floppy disks.    <br>  <br>  Later, a more advanced file system was developed for hard disks in Windows NT, called NTFS (the “NT File System”). This has matured, through several versions, into the latest one that exists alongside FAT32 in Windows XP. <br>  <br>  Xp and Vista- it doesn't reallyt matter|`|837xgMwLaa	Use NTFS, if you go FAT32 then you cannot have files larger than 4gb.<br>  Hard drives always have less space than they should have, around 15%, the bigger the drive, the more you "lose".|`|EzyNYQyZaa	You should go with NTFS its newer and has some good performance benefits.<br>  FAT32 is usually for removable drives|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	FAT 32/NSTF are not kinds of partioning, the are formatting styles. NFTS is the normal these days for XP.<br>  Wait for Windows 7 to come out.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	NTFS is the newer and more technically advanced file system. Use NTFS. As to XP or Vista, it doesn't really matter.

Such as Ubuntu? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://ubuntu.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ubuntu.com/</a>|`|VbP8YWonaa	Be aware that in general Linux is not wireless friendly. Chip set vendors do not want to release their chip set code to open source. To this date only one vendor has released their chip set codes for open source. It is possible to get wireless to work, but a headache getting to that point. I use Linux all the time hardwired, but haven't been able to get the wireless to work. This is the major downfall of using a Linux system for the average computer user, not being able to get the wireless network to work. That is a major turn off for the operating system.<br>  <br>  On the good side I never crash, never get the BSOD and virtually no viruses on the computer. It's fairly stable and my Internet browsing is fairly fast. I still use Windows XP for things that Linux doesn't have. I've got no complaints. It isn't for everyone any more than Windows or Mac is.

Pxkqq8r2aa	if your computer is CRT (ie - not a flat panel type) then its not a good idea as the resolution wont be capable of accurately displaying fonts/text. (ok for videos though)<br>  <br>  If its a CRT and you want to use it, you need a video card with TV Out. Generally this is the form of an RCA plug or S-video. Most CRT TV's wont have VGA input.<br>  <br>  With some video cards its necessary to adjust a jumper on them for NTSC or PAL, depending on what region you are located in. Ensure your driver is set correctly (pal/ntsc) also. <br>  <br>  If you have a reasonably recent Plasma or an LCD, it will make a good computer monitor as they are higher resolution and better capable of displaying the level of detail required. Newer models usually have s-video, rca, vga and hdmi<br>  <br>  Obviously the easiest option here is to use vga as its then just a matter of using your existing monitor cable and any video card. <br>  <br>  for s-video, hdmi or rca, you will need a video card with one of those outputs, ie a tv-out card<br>  <br>  HDMI is the best output format and also has the advantage of carrying audio in the same lead as the video signal.<br>  <br>  If you have DVI on your video card but not HDMI its possible to get DVI-HDMI adapter, and connect using that.|`|duS5ozbQaa	get an RF modulator (from Radio Shack or elsewhere)<br>  <br>  however, TV screens are not good computer monitors, unless you mean an LCD TV, but then you shouldn't need the RF converter.|`|AA11232283	Depends on what type of output connections your comp has and what type of input connections your TV has. <br>  <br>  Ideally, both would have HDMI ports for this, yet it is unlikely. Depending on what setup you are working with, there are many solutions to this. If you could provide what connections each device has, we could be of more help.
