JTSNljLhaa	Pizza Hut by far|`|AA11091315	PH|`|fR2Geezcaa	Definitely Pizza Hut! : )|`|st2zmU88aa	Pizza hut!|`|VCa9zIqwaa	Pizza Hut... yum... =D|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I feel qualified to answer this.  I've worked at both a few years back.  I've been unemployed for a few years and now I need a job.  So, I went into both Hut and Doms earlier this week.<br>  <br>  At Domino's, I filled out my app, gave the manager my resume' and we had a couple of minutes discussion.  I watched the employees working in the back as well.  I left feeling confident.<br>  <br>  Headed off to the Hut.  Walked in and the three people were writing thier names on the sneeze gaurd glass above the buffet pizzas.  I asked for an app, then just stood there and watched them.  Even tho no one was in there, these two just stood there looking at new car magazines and picking thier noses.  Other than saying hello, no one even spoke to me the whole time I was there.  No one did find me an app, so I left, NEVER TO RETURN.<br>  <br>  I will not be treated as a second class citizen when I am old enough to be thier mother!|`|DiaXZSwEaa	dominoes|`|SIqFa1mzaa	Pizza Hut usually<br>  <br>  The last time I ate Pizza Hut, it wasn't that good though.

unM3qcRQaa	ouch =||`|AA11091315	That's what's up. Tell 'em like it is! :)|`|nxeQFPEfaa	Sweetheart, I am NOT on welfare! We don't eat at McDonalds, we like to have people like YOU cater to us, and wait on our family hand & foot and then go home at the end of the day and gripe about your job. We eat out about 4 times a week and tip well for good service, but you are outta your mind if you think I am gonna tip YOU who is not appreciative of it and are one of those who "expect" a certain amount tip. Like I said once before, tipping is OPTIONAL not REQUIRED! Be grateful that you get anything in this sort of economy. You can work somewhere else while in school, don't give me that crap! I work in a hospital assisting RN's & Dr.'s and make good money and make my OWN hours. There are plenty of other resources once you stop being so lazy and get out and utilize them. If you didn't whine and complain on Y! Answers so much you can be looking for another job right now.<br>  <br>  Also: I have two amazing kids that I LOVE  to death and decided to wait until they went to school to go back and get a SECOND degree. I am 25 years old with a degree, a nice 4 bedroom home, another smaller home on a lake in Texas, a nice SUV, money in the bank...AND get this....I am NOT even married, so I did it all alone and I am extremely proud of myself. I go to the University of Texas, not some "CC". And just to prove a point, I never once said that I was better than you or anyone for that matter, but thanks for reminding me that I am!  <br>  <br>  So, next time that you want to stick your nose in other people's business, make sure you are aware of all of the facts. I am entitled to my own opinion, as are you. Stop being a baby, and thanks for spending your precious time focusing on ME!!<br>  <br>  **Oh, and just so people know what you are talking about...here is the link to the answer that apparantley he/she didn't like and is now boo-hooing over!** <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvpUoYVyp.RJJFPePdwSnVvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304204429AA2ic6X&show=7#profile-info-V5CRGK86aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|V5CRGK86aa	Tipping is not optional. Servers and bartenders make less than minimum wage, and most times their checks are $0 because of taxes, etc that are taken out. Also, please keep in mind that the server doesn't even keep that whole tip. They have to tip out the bartender, and busser, food runner and in some places- the host! Servers and bartenders use their tips as income and must claim them as they would if they worked a regular job making $12 an hour. So, I agree with not leaving 20% if you didn't receive the best service, however 20% is the NORM nowadays. So hon, tipping is required, and us restaurant workers are very appreciative of ever dollar we get.
2liwk8yKaa	Am an Aussie, what exactly is a buffalo wing. Is it chicken wings or something.|`|40c2dd53f8275fb6c6f6e563c70a669eaa	Wingstop is absolutely great.<br>  <br>  There is also SmokeEaters and University Chicken that has spicy wings.|`|8ChSjYDNaa	cool guy 8000, I've located a nice list of restaurants that might help. You can drill down the California results by cities close to you. If you call nearby restaurants you can narrow down wich one would work best for you. <a href="http://www.restaurantreviewsratings.com/California-Restaurants.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.restaurantreviewsratings.com/...</a>|`|XSwLJgVYaa	I can't believe people still don't know how to make Buffalo wings. It's not complicated. What makes them Buffalo wings is the hot sauce used. It's only sold in Buffalo. You can order it online. Marinade the wings in butter and Frank's Red Hot Sauce. Then fry them up. You can make them at home. If you don't use Frank's Red Hot Sauce, they're not Buffalo wings.|`|7623Hd7naa	I really like Tony Roma's. There are several in California.
nxeQFPEfaa	The melting pot!<br>  Very good treat, something out of the ordinary, and so romantic. I have only been once because of the price, but it was so0o0 worth it! They have very wide selection, my friend was pleasantly surprised!|`|P1Ii9Ex5aa	Well Im not sure exactly where you are. But if your in L.A. try the Bonaventure hotel. the restaurant is beautiful at  the top. nice views, excellent food, formal attire a must.|`|Q2sy3BGOaa	Ruth's Chris<br>  literally the best steak i've ever had and ever will in my life<br>  anybody that loves meat will love it|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	Depends on where you are!|`|AA10458195	Go to Paris. There are so many places to eat that you can be there for<br>  months and not try them all.

AA10975447	I work for the health department. I know I'll get thumbed way down for this, but you *really* don't want to go to those Asian buffets. Let me restate that: I advise you as a professional to not patronize those buffets.<br>  <br>  I've been working on foodborne illnesses for three years, and I have been on inspections to some of these buffets (I will never eat in K-Town again). They routinely break the simplest and most important rules we have. Food isn't stored in the right containers (kim chee fermenting in Rubbermaid trash bins). Kitchen equipment is filthy. No hand sinks in food prep areas. Stuff being reused that really ought not be reused. We have war stories. I wish I could post photos, I really do.<br>  <br>  But if you must go, I'm sure you can check out <a href="http://www.yelp.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yelp.com</a> for buffets. They're a great source of my workload. If you get sick off them, you might have to give me a call.<br>  <br>  ps. If you're wondering how these places stay open, it's because a "C" is still passing. You do not want to see what a "C" grade kitchen looks like. Worse, you do not want to SMELL a "C" grade kitchen.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	The best one I've had is called Grand China Buffet in Torrance (which is just south of LA near Redondo Beach). It has the same food for lunch as dinner, but it's about $5 cheaper at lunch.  Buffet includes: fruit, salads, chinese dim sum style appetizers, crab legs, fish dishes, rice, soups, several noodle dishes, stir-fry, sushi, ribs, pizza, french fries (it includes some American stuff as well), cookies, and desserts.  For an all-you-can eat buffet, it's the best one I've tried.<br>  <br>  22901 Hawthorne Blvd, Torrance, CA? - (310) 373-9778?|`|gaXUIduMaa	It seems like the Chinese buffets are all around.  All you need to do is go to an area that has some Asian residents.  I do recommend you only visit those places that have a large number of Asian customers, have a B health dept grade or better and is spotless in cleanliness.  If the place you are talking about is Panda Inn or Panda Express, the answer is that they are not buffets.  If it actually is Panda Buffet, you will have to call them but most buffets are all you can eat.  Note that most buffets have higher prices on weekends than on weekdays.|`|wn1KKbXQaa	There are several all you can eat Chinese buffets in the San Gabriel Valley.  West Coast Seafood in Hacienda Heights, World Buffet in West Covina, Asia Buffet in the City of Industry, to name a few.|`|VqvLrwZGaa	There is a place in Burbank called New Town Buffet. I heard it was good.|`|EpCuEvvdaa	mr chow
gq93af81aa	The Steak Queso burrito or the Ancho Chile BBQ with chicken.  Now if they had Ancho BBQ with Steak that would be the best of both worlds.|`|z4V9kdR8aa	pork burrito|`|J6ZBUHgdaa	I like the queso on top of a naked burrito with ground beef, all the salsas mixed, cheese and sour cream, with a side of guac and chips.  Waaaay too much fat/calories, but a great treat.|`|rko5Mz6Gaa	chicken and or steak queso burrito<br>  chicken and or steak taco salad<br>  chips and warm three cheese queso =D|`|M3r1s6oYaa	Their salsa salad! Fresh and spicy ;)|`|NbbRCxwxaa	burrito bowl
Dfeemjagaa	quarter pounder has more beef and i believe is flame broiled, while Mc. D's is less meat and cooked than nucked when they serve it. they both have different spices as well. man now i want one!!! quarter pounders are yummyyyy!|`|22a6171dbf228d985a61502855bebebfaa	It is called "your imagination."<br>  <br>  The burgers are cooked the exact same way and made out of the same beef. They're fried, NOT flame broiled. That's it. When you go into a McDonalds' next time look past the counter at the kitchen.<br>  <br>  I did the McDonalds' thing 30 years ago. The cheeseburgers and quarter pounder (with cheese) burgers come from the same source and are made from the same beef. The only difference is the size of the burger.|`|7b3e55f1520292b18d56fea36b36fdccaa	The Power of Perception. You assume the dollar one wont be as good as the one you pay more for and then it isnt.|`|DiaXZSwEaa	because its a dollar|`|M3r1s6oYaa	It might not be the beef. They put different things in the burger to make every burger taste different. But if you took the beef out of each burger and compared it, then its probably because they fry it longer or in different things. <br>  <br>  ps. Thanks for eating McDonald not burger king!|`|lB2asZb2aa	because if u look closely... especially in those 24hr mcdonals; it seems like before it gets to the store they slice the 1/4lb ones into smaller ones. so the thinner they are the faster they cook n they over cook them, makin them shrink n taste worst then their bigger counterparts|`|BnqjD1P2aa	In Hamburger patties we eat 1/10 portion of  pound beef instead of Quarter Pounder patties we eat 1/4 portion of pound beef.|`|sRYsux2kaa	The $1 hamburger is probably made of 100% ally cats or whatever roadkill McDonalds can find in their parking lot.|`|AA11230809	because it IS better|`|st2zmU88aa	umm i think thats a matter of personal opinion cause i don't taste a difference at all.|`|9I3wHIdraa	Take a guess at how much the regular burger patty weighs?
