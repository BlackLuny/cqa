20090226160509AA65Cwr	Pets;Reptiles	Crested Gecko - temporary paralysis, seizure-like symptoms?	I have a crested gecko and when I took it out today, it was very stiff and did not move.  Eventually it started to move, but it couldn't really lift its legs; rather, it kind of dragged itself around to move.  Then, it broke out into a sort of seizure-like action; it started shaking and convulsing.  I took it to my local reptile store where I bought it, and they said it may be a calcium deficiency.  I bought some calcium powder to give it. A little while after I left the reptile store, it had the "seizure" again.        Does anyone know why this is happening, or what I can do to help it? I don't want it to die! Thanks for all the help.

I feed my cats Purina because that is what the shelter fed them when I got them and I didn't want to change their diet and upset their stomachs. However, a friend of mine was telling me Purina is not so good. What is a good food for cats? I am new at the whole cat thing. And if I decide to change their diet, do I mix the two foods together at first so that they gradually get used to it? Thanks!

20090226161217AAKSEL1	Pets;Fish	Molly disease or parasite?	I have a white female balloon molly who eats and swims around the tank fine.     But on one side of her body, her gill cover (I am not sure if it's the right word) is losing color.  It used to be all white just like the rest of her body, but since 2 days ago, there are round patches that are see through and I can see her gills inside.       I first freaked out because I though they were actual holes, but not really.  It seems the just white color inside is gone?  there's a string that's been hanging from her gills more than one day now which doesn't look like any anchor worm or parasite on common fish disease pages I looked up.   In fact, I would have thought is a clear string of poo that collects debris and plant matter around the tank.  Because it's clear and green/brown with the plant debris stuck on it.      Sorry for the long details, but I have no idea if she's actually sick.  I have quarantined her right now, but I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me what is wrong with her.      Thank you!

20090226161815AAPK5xR	Pets;Dogs	What happens if I accidentally drop my dog's leash and he bites someone?	Background: I had my 15 pound Papillon mixed breed dog on a leash waiting for an elevator at my condo like I do 4 times a day.  When the elevator door opened, I was standing at an angle to the floor selection panel side of the elevator and did not see anyone in the elevator. A moment later, our janitor emerged from behind the obscured corner and this scared the dog.  The dog jumped forward and the leash slipped out of my hand. He lunged at the man's crotch area and his teeth caught the man's pants, tearing a 1/4" hole.  I ensured the man was OK and offered to buy him new pants, but he declined.       My homeowner's association is trying to fine me $150 for the following reason:    "It was observed by security cameras on February 19, 2009 that one of your dogs was on the property unleashed.  It was also reported that one of your dogs bit someone coming out of the elevator."        Now, I know the security camera line is a lie, because the dog has never been off leash in a common area. I do not believe they could produce any footage. However, the fact remains that I did accidentally drop the leash.    Is this something I should fight? I can appeal to the HOA board within 10 days.    If so, how? Ask them to produce the security tapes?

20090226162820AALTiNZ	Pets;Dogs	My 6 mo. old won't stop biting my 5 1/2 week old puppy?	Okay, I have a 6 month old purebred Siberian Husky puppy, we've had him for about 3 months now and he's great, just really hyper. Yesterday we went and picked up a 5 1/2 week old Lab/German shepherd puppy. Loki (the husky) was being very gentle in playing, as far as biting goes, all day yesterday and up to about 20 minutes ago. Though he's not really biting the puppy, he's just putting his teeth on him then bouncing backwards and repeating. He's also running in circles around him and kind of stepping on him a little. Just about 20 minutes ago, he started making a really deep growl at the baby puppy and trying to bite him really hard, I pulled him back and he kept trying so I locked him out of the room.      I understand that he's probably trying to establish dominance as the alpha dog, but I'm really scared he's going to hurt the baby puppy. Can anybody tell me what to do?      I've tried just smacking him on the tip of the nose when he bites at him, and when he was acting aggressive towards him i grabbed him back by his neck-fat (like their mothers do). Please help!!!      - Ali

I dont know much about being a vetenerian and im not too sure if i would like to perform surgery on animals so i dont know if this job would be for me, BUT I HAVE NEVER TRIED IT BEFORE so i have no idea what to expect!

20090226172753AAVbbHe	Pets;Cats	Home treatment for watery eyes and flaky skin?	My youngest cat (around 5 yo) has watery eyes today. The discharge is clear, just like tears. She is behaving as usual, eating as usual, etc. I also noticed that her skin is getting a little flaky for the past month or so. Nothing major, but I notice a little bit of the whitish flakes when I brush her. The other cat does not share any of the symptoms.      We recently got a new dog from a shelter and he has allergies with dry skin, itching, eye discharges, the works. Would it be ok to give the cat a tiny little dose of the dog's Omega 3 supplement for her skin? What about the eye discharge, would it be ok to give her Benadryl like I give the dog? If so, what is the dosage for a 14.5 pound cat?      I would take her to the vet if this was a serious condition, but I spent lots of cash with the dog's issues (he came from the shelter with really poor health) and I would rather try to remedy these minor problems at home if possible.      Thanks!

20090226175604AA74Gwr	Pets;Rodents	Dwarf Hamster Babies?	I recently bought a dwarf hamster, acouple weeks after i bought her she had babies. Needless to say i will never shop at this pet store again but any ways. she had 6 babies and latly ive only been seeing 5. i found what appears to be the face of a baby hamster (the wisker/nose portion) obviously her or the babies ate it. could it have possibly been ill or why could this have happened? i took precautions not to touch the babies or get my sent on them. Will the rest of the babies be alright? They were born on February 17th. Im expecting their eyes to open soon maybe even tommarrow ,and they have some fur and they crawl around alittle bit. When can i safely take the babies out of the cage and pet them to get them used to me? I cant even put my hand in the cage now because of mamma (shes very cage agressive but isnt when i take her out of the cage). Also when should i take them away from their mom and seperate males and females so i dont have any more babies. Because one of them appears to have gotten eaten should i be worried for the others?

I gave him some more apples today (Thursday).    If he has diarrhea, what should I do?

20090226172038AAySoZU	Pets;Dogs	Two Questions...one about my dog and one about her birthday?	My first question-   My dog's 1st birthday is Saturday.  With my old dog, we didn't give him a big celebration, so I don't want to give my dog a big celebration, either.  Also, she just had a surgery about a week ago, so we can't be letting her rough around with other dogs.  I want to maybe make a batch of cupcakes and make her a special one with less batter and a few dog cookies, but I'm not sure what mix would be the best (box mix, obviously not chocolate).  If I shouldn't be giving her cupcakes at all, does anyone have a good substitution?      2nd Question-   Right now my dog is sitting at my feet, whining and shaking slightly.  For the last few minutes she's been pacing around the room, tail down, and when I pick her up, she wiggles in my arms trying to get away, or she pants excessively.  I would normally think she's scared or nervous, but the wiggling is odd. Does anyone know why she's acting this way?

20090226174839AAUDMsF	Pets;Fish	What could possibly be wrong with my bettas?	I have always kept fish, especially bettas and have always had good luck with them.  However, I keep having some trouble with bettas lately.  In the past year I have purchased four bettas, three of which have died.  The first developed fungus (white cottony patches all over his body).  I treated him for it, but he died before the medication could take effect.  A month or so later I bought a new betta and shortly after I purchased him he got fin rot and ick.  He responded well to treatment and now he's thriving.  I've had him for a year now.  A few months after having him I purchased a new betta.  I had him for perhaps a month.  He was fine one day, and the next day I got home from work he was dead.  He showed no signs of illness before he died, he was active, bright, and eating like a pig.  A few days ago I purchased a new betta and last night he was absolutely fine.  Today he was dead.  I just don't get it.  I had a lot of bettas over the years and have never had trouble with them.  The first three bettas came from different pet stores, and this last one came from the same place as Mr. Peabody (the thriving one).  Has anyone experienced these kinds of trouble with bettas?  Any idea as to the cause?  I use filtered and conditioned tap water, they get regular water changes, and never any more food than they can eat in a few minutes.  I am so disappointed that all of this is happening, I've never had problems with bettas before.  Any insight would be great.

20090226173234AA1lM71	Pets;Horses	My Horse is becoming ring sour?	I have been training a horse that I am leasing and trying to get him back into condition. (When I first got him he was obese! He lost about 45-50 pounds and still has a ways to go)  So, I have been riding him every day.  Usually he is responsive and has a sensitive mouth.  On good days I don't even have to use the reins, he works mostly off of leg pressure.  Yet lately, he has become soo ring sour and fights me the entire time.  I have tried setting up obstacles and he still acts the same.  I even bought a horse soccer ball!!! I used to ride him every day but I have started to ride him only six days a week because of his change in behavior. I thought that he needed a break. (He still gets a day off) but he needs to be ridden because he still has a lot of weight to lose.  I have no control over his feeding, since I am not the legal owner of him.  There are no trails available and I don't have a trainer.  What can I do to stop him from acting up in the arena?

20090226181321AAYaCQ6	Pets;Cats	Why is my cat making this noise?	My cat Elwood is apparently having some problems again.  I had to take him off his diet of Kibble N Bits and Bacon flavored Chuck Wagon about two weeks ago because of his urinary problems and started feeding him grilled ham and cheese sandwiches instead.      He was fine for about a week, but then I noticed that he started drinking a lot more milk than I usually give him.  He now goes through about 3/4 of a gallon every day, and is up to 4 grilled ham and cheese sandwiches (made with extra Tillamook Cheddar Cheese and processed ham chunks from the supermercado on the corner).      All was good and fine, but yesterday Elwood started making this weird noise....it kind of sounds like  "Pfffrrrpttt...."      What is this noise??  He does it all the time now....  Is Elwood farting??

20090225120827AAEYUeN	Pets;Dogs	What should I name my new dog?	I already have an 8 yr old yellow Labrador Retriever named Molly, but now I have a new addition to the family--a 6 week old puppy that looks a lot like a yellow lab, but I'm not so sure. What should I name her? I'm looking for a name that doesn't rhyme with Molly (to avoid confusion) and not a name thats totally unique (otherwise one dog has a normal name and the other has some off-the-wall name) but is a good name too (not like Spot or Fido).      I really like the following names: Geneva, Stella; but I'm not so sure

20090226183331AAuK4XD	Pets;Horses	Pony rushes at the canter..?? Help!?	I have a 13.1 hand pony that is a great kids horse and has a nice even walk and trot. Her one problem is stopping...she does NOT listen to the bit. She takes a few seconds the actually stop. Her worst problem is the canter! She has a nice even canter for the first few seconds then all of a sudden she GOES! She literally runs away with me. Today I thought I was going to kill myself. She tears around the turns and I can't stop her trying to pull the reins back. I try relaxing my body but nothing works. The saddle that I use on her is a Wintec western and it's just a tad bit tight on her wither. Do you think this could be causing the problem?     When I bought her her owner told me that she rushed at the canter. I'm terrified to try to canter her again! I have an english saddle that fits her but I don't feel as safe in it.   I am 125lbs...do you think I could be too heavy for her? I have a heavy leather western saddle that might fit her but do you think it would be too much weight for her to carry?      Sorry for all the info and questions.... : /   But thanks in advance!

20090226190559AAsGwQ6	Pets;Rodents	Pet rats being introduced...what are they doing?	I introduced two of my 3 month old male rats today on a stair landing with a baseball cap in the middle to act as a hiding spot.  My first rat, Flea, has met met a year old rat and plays with him sometimes, and Flea has always been the submissive one- squeaking and standing, leaning away from him with his hands reaching out.  Lately, though, he's been testing his limits I think, and his been standing ontop of his buddy's head and trying to pin him down.   So when I introduced him to the new one, Biscuit, Flea was being aggressive, I think.  He would swing his butt around at him and kick him with his hind leg.  Biscuit seemed infatuated with him and wouldn't stop following, but Flea seemed to be done and ran up to my shoulder.  Both of them seemed pretty stressed after about an hour of hiding in the hat and wrestling, pinning, and standing-up "show downs".  Both were very vocal.     How long is this supposed to last each day?  I can't put their cages next to each other because Flea's cage has been converted from a dresser, and there's no room by it for Biscuit's.  Should I just keep giving them little play dates or should I just go ahead and switch their    cages, even though Biscuit just moved into it?  What are signs of aggression or fear?

Right now it's storming pretty bad, and the only two calming songs I have are: "Baby Mine" from Dumbo and "Lara's Theme" from Dr. Zhivago.      My lab is TERRIFIED of thunder.  But once we get her in her bed and play calming music, she goes right to sleep.  I was just wondering if anyone else plays calming music for their dogs and if so, what do you play?  I'm probably going to get sick of these two songs, so I'm open to suggestions.      Also, if your dog is scared of thunder & you don't listen to music, what do you do?  (I'm thinking of getting one of those dog jackets for dogs that are scared of storms...but I don't know if they work)      Thanks so much, from my labrador and I.

We decided to adopt another kitten cause she was so cute. She is only 6 weeks old. I figured since they both came from the same rescue home they should be fine since they have been around cats their whole lives. Well my older kitten doesnt seem to like my younger one at all. She used to hiss and try to scare her and now she growls.      I put the new kitten in a room by herself with all her supplies. I moved both of their food bowls on each side of the door. My older kitten just sits at the door until i open it. I put a baby gate up and leave to door open so they can see each other and get used to eating with each other. My older kitten growls whenever they are near each other and begs to get in the room when i'm in it with the new kitten. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to spend time with each cat equally but my older one doesn't seem to be giving in. What should i do??

20090226184727AADdsGj	Pets;Dogs	I have a dog she is stubborn and doesnt want to listen?	I have a dog i thibnk she is sorta like a retriever of some kind maybe jack russel, but she is a big dog proboable 7 years old, from pup to 7 years is my guess, i was given to her from a friend who lived in the country and someone abandoned her and he took her in, he already has 2 dogs this made three, i went to visit sevral times  I Am handicapped by the way my legs do not go all the way straight so that i could walk. so i am in a wheel chair most of the time. I needed the dog to help me was hoping since she seemed to be good arround me when i vistited, that she would make a good dog for me. MY problem is  she learend very quickly how to hand shake, sit lay, bark, rolll, and beg at the begiin ing and she would bark to tell me she wanted in or out to go potty. well i have been trying to teach her to stay off my couch and my bed, and she stays off as long as i am in the room and paying attention to watch her, as soon as i turn my back to go any where  wther it is in another room or to the kitchedn , she thinks she can go in any of the rooms that i made of limits and jump on my clean bed, i have told her no many times and had her go to the bed said no and lightly gave her a pat on the bottom, and said no treats next time.  well she still refuses to listen and stay off when im not looking and thinks she can get away with it. just to day i was easting sat my food on the table top  in the living room  went to the other room to let some one in the back, she though she could go snatch my food even though she knew it was bad, and she did it any way i came back in the room noticed she had gotten it was eating it. I went over to her lifted her chin up  and opend her mouht and took the food away and sorta spanked her lightly while saying no bad doggy and threw the food away. she wined and went to the other room oposite my bed room and tried to hid e iunder the guest bedroom.  bed. and whined and whined. this is getting very frustrating, because she also does this any time i try to get her to mind me and go to the leash in my hand so that i can take her with me for walks while i drive my  electric  wheel chair scooter. i tried to get her to get imn a kid carrier that you use to pull behind your bike when you are riding and taking your kids, a friend gave me it to  go shpping and carry my grocieries in it. well i tied to get her to get in it so i could take her with me and she persisted to be stubborn stay laying on the floor and  prevnt me from lifting her up.  this is the type if additude i am trying to erase from her or fix. can anyone help.  she dont get doggy biscute bone treats when she is not minding .   By the way id like to add that she strated this additude change when i went and got a leashe  to take her oustside to potty, and started making that the rule, cause when ifiirst got her i didnt have a fince and  or a leashe she would go out id let her run free and she would go wher evr she please to go potty and some times not come back for hours, because i coculdt chanse her, and she started developing the addittude change after i got the lease and made her start going out only that way from then on. sorta like she is being a spoiled bratt. and im getting sick of it.

20090226104033AAzteYT	Pets;Fish	Is 72F a good tempurature for goldfish?	The thermometer in my goldfish aquarium said it was 72F. Is that too warm, too cold, just right? should it be colder or warmer? They're in a 55gal until they're moved to an outdoor pond that'll be around 120-150gal. There are two 9"ers, three 4"-6", one 2" and two 1"ers. Yes, it's badly overstocked. The three smallest ones may stay inside until they're bigger. The two 9"ers were in a pond until it broke, but we are going to instead use an above ground pond at my moms house because we go outside more over there. There is a 5 gallon (?) heater in the aquarium. I believe it's a 5gal, it's tiny. I the whole aquarium from a real poor neighborhood downtown for $75 which came with a hood + light (we don't use the light, dangerous, but we use the hood), filter, air pump, tons of gravel, bubbler thingy which goes on a short wall, and a heater.       is 72F a good temp for them?

20090226155522AAJUVAM	Pets;Horses	Two questions: one about grain, the other about trailers.?	1. I heard that sweet feed makes a horse more hyper. When we were at my old farm everyone fed their horse pellets, so I did the same. Jude was well behaved, but it was also summer time. I moved him to a new farm in fall and still bought him the same grain with pellets. I guess because he smelt everyone eating sweet feed he wasn't happy anymore with his pellets so he stopped eating them. He would leave the whole bin full. I started feeding him what the rest of the boys were getting, half sweet feed, not too sure what the other half is, he eats it, but all winter he's been really up. Ridiculously strung out. Should I continue this diet and see if he gets any better during the summer or what else should I do...? How much does sweet feed get a horse going?      2. I just bought a brand new trailer too. My horse has always been really good at loading, and would just stand, but in this new trailer he's been pawing at the ground a lot. This isn't a common habit of his - he doesn't do it when standing in the cross ties or when he stood in his old trailer. Is it just because it's new and doesn't smell of horses? (the old trailer was a 1980 so it's been around for a long time....) What could be the problem! and what's a good solution?
20090226184140AAokPe2	Pets;Dogs	Will my puppy bark less when he gets older?	He and my dog play alot, and he barks soooo much while they play. I know it's totally normal for dogs to bark, but it gets kind of annoying, and my grown dog rarely barks while they play. She does make growly noises, but she doesn't bark.       Is the constant barking while playing a puppy thing or is it just his thing? Will he grow out of it? Do I have to train him out of it? Or is it just something I'll have to learn to deal with?      I think he's either a lab/akita mix or a lab/shiba mix (he's only 9 wks, so I cant really tell) and none of those breeds are known for barking alot but maybe my puppy is just a weirdo

20090226170142AAxlhqJ	Pets;Fish	Can this harm my fish?	Hi. I sometimes get "First Bites" fry food for my baby fish, but I don't like the bag it comes in, so I put the food in an old empty sour cream container. What I'm scared about though is, my Dad always washes the containers with soap and water before he puts them away, (obviously) so I'm worried that there may be some soap residue on the container that has the food in it? The fish seem to be doing fine, but I just recently put some algae wafers in an old goldfish food container that was washed with soap and water, so I'm still worried that there may be some soap residue on the container. They're all rinsed before drying, but I'm still very scared that this may harm my fish. Do you think so?      I will choose best answer and any other answers will be appreciated!   Thanks!

But they don't nap and cuddle on it.  Is there any way i can get them to use their hammock for the intended purpose?  I think if they would try it they would be much more comfy than on the bedding and cage floor.       I try putting their treats and toys in the hammock but they just snatch everything off.

I asked my mum and she said I could buy it tomorrow so I'm trying to come up with some impressive names for him.   I was thinking Sunshine but that's incredibly unoriginal and boring so I thought "Maybe I could name it the Scientifically accurate name for sun!"   Turns out that's "Sol" and not as exciting as I was hoping.      So other names I have written down include:   -Man    (cause it's obviously going to be one)   -Columbus 2000    (but then I realized that sounds too much like "Nimbus 2000" from the Harry Potter books)   -Napolean    (but that's kind of mean considering he wasn't... well.... a very great guy to say the least)   -Celine Dion    (she's Canadian, come on! I don't care if it's a guy)   -Joel    (Because I love Billy Joel and Joel Barish)   -Holliday    (like "Holly"day or "Hollandaise sauce" or however that's spelled)   -Hollandaise would actually be pretty cool   -Maybe "Ray Charles"      I dunno, any of you have great ideas for something super crazy or completely ironic (due to the fact it's yellow)?      I need some inspiration.

20090226174123AAVUAA0	Pets;Dogs	Vaccine question on 7 week old puppy?	I just got a 7 week old puppy. He turned 7 weeks on Tuesday, and I took him home Sunday.   He hadn't had any vaccines, so I gave him his first one on Monday.   I know he needs more vaccines, many more in fact.   But I am curious about this:      I live at home, he goes to the bathroom outside already very well.   My boyfriend lives in a decent apartment. But just because it looks nice, doesn't mean the people are nice or smart.   He wont go on piddle pads, well he goes poop but not urinates.      So if I let him out at my boyfriends apartment, is he protected much at all? I am so worried about parvo, but he goes outside so much better, and it's so much easier.   So does the first vaccine help against that at all? I know he needs more every 3-4 weeks 3 more times.    I just dont want him to get parvo, but he likes to go potty outside more.

Before you tell me tropicals can not be with coldwater, let me point out bristlenose plecos are sub-tropical, meaning they can do fine in warm OR cool temps, making them a fine tank mate for goldfish. I can't get the goldfish for a little while, but tomorrow I am going to the fish store, just to look, and they sell bristlnoses there. Should I get a bristlenose right now and then later remove the tropicals and add the goldfish even later. Or should I wait until the tropicals are removed before adding the bristlenose pleco and then the goldfish later?   Also, random questions to add to this, how fast to bristlnoses grow?

I like the look of this roached mane  http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h164/S...  but I don’t know how to make it like that, any ideas? here’s a picture of my QH.       http://s90.photobucket.com/albums/k241/t...       You can see more pictures of him by clicking the arrow on the right hand side.      Do you think he would look good with a roached mane? If so, how do I do it right so that it will look like the one in the picture? Can it possibly look the same as the picture with his kind of mane?

20090226174854AAvEdJK	Pets;Rodents	Pet rat..."all they need"...?	I have two 3 month old male rats, both from seperate breeders, Flea from a breeder and Biscuit from a pet store.  I know you're not supposed to buy from a pet store because of diseases, but Flea was getting depressed and I was in a hurry to buy him a buddy.  We had Biscuit checked out thoroughly (teeth, nails, coat, lungs, nose, eyes, everything) and quarantined him.   I've had Flea for about 3 to 4 weeks now, and I've been SO paranoid the whole time I've had him.  He's a sneezer (about 4 times a day), so I had him checked by his breeder's mom, talked to a rat specialist or two, and called a vet.  Everyone told me I'm being hyper sensitive, and I knew I was, but I couldn't help it. Every hour I would examine his nose and listen to his lungs, probably stressing him out.     I got Biscuit a week ago, and so far zero sneezes, so I'm not worried about him.   Today Flea started making congestion sounds in his nose (almost like a grunting), but it only lasted for about 3 minutes, then went away and I haven't heard it again and it's been five hours.  I got really upset and started crying (which is embarassing. I'm almost nineteen.), and everyone there started getting onto me, telling me that I was overreacting.  I've always been SUPER sensitive about animals, and I didn't understand how everyone could be so insensitive.     But my friend there, who's been a rat owner for 4 years, gave me a "verbal slap in the face", telling me that all they need is food, water, a nice place to live, and lots of love and fun.  Should I just let go and focus on playing with Flea and Biscuit, and give them the best lives I can, however long they are? Or should I be as protective as I am and take them to the vet and spend $400 on them?  Which is what I would love to do, but I seem to be the only one.   *Flea is a VERY hyper active rat.  I've been noticing his sneezing for about 2 or 3 weeks now, and I was always waiting to see if the other symptoms of a respiratory infection showed up, like wheezing, rasping, laboured breathing, lathargy, clicking in the lungs, and even red nails, which I've only heard about from one person, but doesn't hurt to check.  None of these showed up, and his energy level is still through the roof, even during his "grunting".  And he goes through food like a pig.  My friend told me if a rat is happy, eating, active, and clean, then there's nothing to worry about.   I just feel so sick thinking about a potential problem. :(
20090226163921AAvuYUy	Pets;Horses	Trail and Endurance Question?

20090226181055AAPgtKi	Pets;Horses	Information about Hunter, Hunter/Jumper, Hunter Under Saddle?	I have been riding horses for about a year and a half, and have done one low level jumping show.  The people at my barn are in Pony Club and do eventing type riding.  I am leasing a horse that was previously used for hunters, and heard about some local hunter shows that I was thinking about doing.  I have no hunter experience, but I know basically how a Hunter Under Saddle class works and what is looked for in a hunter show (impeccable turnout and a smooth, effortless ride, etc.).  Other than that, I know nothing about Hunters.  Could someone tell me how a hunter/jumper show works and about the other types of hunter shows?  What are the major differences in eventing and hunters (other than the basics and the things I mentioned above).  What do you think of hunters?  I think the hunter under saddle classes would be great to start out in since you are in a large group, so I wouldn't be as nervous.  (I was a nervous wreck at my first show, and it was pretty much a schooling show!)  Overall, what are the best and worst things about hunters?  Any information that might help me decide whether or not to switch to hunters would be great!  Thank you!

20090226181608AAMjUwM	Pets;Rodents	Another baby piggie question?	I have a total of 4 guinea pigs.  Two "adult" females, and two babies.  The babies are 2.5 weeks old.  Well, Mama and Auntie are both in heat.  I caught one of the babies trying to mount the mother.  I pulled him out right away into another cage.  I am not 100% sure if the other baby is a boy or girl, so I pulled that one too.  Questions are.......      1.  Is it going to be bad for me to pull those babies away from the mother that soon due to them nursing?      2.  Can a 2.5 week old baby REALLY get another piggie pregnant or is he just practicing right now?  Should I worry that Mom may be pregnant again already?      3.  The boy baby is going to a new home tomorrow.  In the mean time, I put the other baby in with him cause I don't want to take any chances of it being a boy too and both females are in heat right now.  As long as the other baby isn't showing signs of being "in heat", they should be ok together overnight.  Right?      I know there are alot of you that are very "cavy smart".  I called our vet and was told they couldn't really tell the sex of the babies for me until 3-4 weeks old and I was going to take them in next week for the vet to sex them, but the signs are pretty obvious.  Right?      And lastly, why are the two females trying to mount each other then bicker with each other.  Could the baby not really be a boy? Help!!!!!!

20090226184400AAljfLM	Pets;Rodents	Have a few questions about my new rats..?	I've been wanting..something for a while. I had guinea pigs a few years ago and while I loved them to death, they were horribly messy and smelled awful. One of my friends has two rats and while I found them extremely adorable I wasn't convinced I could handle them.   But the SECOND I went to PetsMart I fell in love. So I went home and did a LOT of research, went back and got two.      They are both females.One is a dumbo who is about five months old(about..the lady wasn't sure) and the other is a good bit younger than her..and a good bit smaller.      Now, I've had a lot of animals over the years, and I know they all have little fights here and there, to establish pecking order. And if that's the case, then that's fine..but I just want to make sure that's the case. I mean, they fall asleep together, all of that. So I just wanted to check.      And OK, I lied, I have more than a few questions.      They're both cleaning themselves a lot. And I know that they do that..but how much is too much?       And they do this thing when they come up to me...they like..nibble on my fingers. It's not biting, not at all. My friend says that it's normal, that they're just checking things out. But again, just wanted to check.      And last, but definitely not least. They really, REALLY don't want to be picked up. They will crawl all over my hands and crawl out onto the cage door while I'm holding it and put their front paws onto my chest. But they WILL NOT get off the door. And I'm afraid to just reach in there and yank them up. I really don't want to scare them.    And when I DO pick them up, they poop all over the place. Out of fear I'm sure.   Their cage is up off of the floor because I have a dog. I could but the cage down onto the floor in my room but my mom's afraid the bedding could screw with my allergies. But if they really need to be on the ground (like I've read), then I'll do what's best.      I know it's a lot. But I'm just want to make sure I'm doing everything right. I'd hate to mess anything up, I'm already in love with them.

20090226155938AA8F08e	Pets;Cats	What's the best cat food...here are my problems.?	I have two indoor-only male cats around 3 years old.  They are normal weight.  They both have problems with hairballs and dandruff and I have been trying to feed them the best kind of food for cats.  They get Wellness Core (grain free) dry food that we free-feed.  And then at night they get a pouch of Wellness wet food (I also add water to make a gravy for them to make sure they are getting enough H2O).  They don't love either of those foods, but they will tolerate it.  (Sometimes the wet food is left in the bowl)      They do not like any pate food, so I won't be able to go with anything that isn't in a pouch.  We have tried getting grass to help with the hairballs and they don't seem to know that they are supposed to eat it.  I have also tried vasaline on their paws and it didn't seem to do much.  I brush them several times a week, but they freak if I try to bathe them.  I have been adding fish oil to the wet food, but it doesn't seem to be helping the dandruff much.      The thing is...they used to get Iams Indoor Hairball dry food and Friskies pouches (that they loved). And we didn't seem to have as many problems with dandruff and hairballs...of course maybe the winter weather has more to do with it than the food?        I know Iams/Friskies has bad stuff like wheat gluten, chicken meal or by-products in them, so I'd like to stay away from them, but if they don't like the "good food" what is a mommy to do?        I know some of you are experts on cat food and what works best.  Please let me know what you think I should do to help them...poor Felix puked up a huge hairball the other night and didn't even feel well enough to eat his supper it.   Thanks in advance for your advice.

20090226102451AAytK1W	Pets;Reptiles	Stuff on turtle shell?	I just bought my turtle. Florida red bellied. When  bought him there was green stuff on turtle's shell, and I thought "OK it's just algae" but now there are like 4 or 5 spots, white hairs that look like mold, on the out side of his shell. It looks like he is shedding and he is not eating much just little nibbles here and there unless he is eating the feeders in the tank at night, cause he bask more of the day and we don't see him eat in the daytime. No I am not trained in the art of water reptiles, I'm better with the dry ones and the lady in the store was not very helpful, I had to go to a different store about 2 days later to get the rest of my supplies. (uvb light, day-glo, night-glo, decent basking area, water filter and mealworms (he already had the reptomin sticks))at the time she sold me an air filter which i thought was a water filter and had to change the water every day and she originally told me i didn't need a light yet. so because of her improper help and my slight info he sat in the dark lukewarm water for 2 days until i could find out everything to properly help him help him. now this furry green stuff and shedding. I just want a happy and healthy animal. please tell me what to do next.

20090226171513AAlyrsF	Pets;Cats	I need help because I don't know what to think...?	Ok, So I have had my cat- Sunny for about three years. He was given to me as a birthday present when i was fifteen. He was a beautiful cat and he was very loving. He meant a lot to me. Recently my parents went through a pretty messy seperation. They are struggling to get along and its bad, as any seperation is. the other day my cat pooped inside the house and my dad said "if he S**** in here one more time he is gone for good!!!" and was very upset. Then later that night Sunny was seen asleep on the dining room chair like he always is WITH his collar ON. this was about 7:30. I went to my boyfriend's house and came back an hour later. When I came back Sunny was nowhere to be found and his collar was on a shelf in the kitchen. My dad says he never let him out and he never took his collar off. he has even helped me put up signs for him and call animal shelters. He says he is determined to find him. I am very upset because my dad was the only one home and this cat meant very very much to me. am I crazy or does it seem like my dad did something to my cat?

She used to be a class pet, but I've changed schools and the new principal will not allow class pets.  She used to come to school with me every single day (and come home at night).  She was so entertained in my classroom...the kids adored her and treated her very well.  However, she is now home, alone, all day.  I feel so terrible, but I am concerned about how she might react to a rat being introduced after so much time alone.  If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it!

20090226192119AAkyyO1	Pets;Fish	If my tiger barb is currently being nice to my gourami will he ever become more aggressive?	I bought the two three days ago and the first hour or so the barb was nipping, but the gourami has figured out how to always be on the opposite side of the tank or inside the decorative shelters. Even when the barb next to the gourami, he doesn't bother her much. I've been reading about the barb and it says that they are always aggressive and have managed to kill fish within days because of nipping. Since this doesn't seem to be an issue yet, does anyone that has owned barbs know if it will become one later?

20090226120144AAUvtWH	Pets;Fish	Cichlids with Cotton Wool Disease - Don't know what to do...?	I noticed cotton wool disease forming around the mouth of one of my lelupi two days ago (a couple of days after getting it from a shop) and I immediately treated the tank with Interpet Anti Fungus and Finrot. Straight away I regretted this because I should have done a big water change first. The cotton wool has gone down slightly on the lelupi but I've just noticed it on another one now (one it's been fighting with). All others seem to be OK except one brichardi has a long stringy poo.      Also, a few hours after treating the tank I did a 20% water change because all of the fish went really lethargic and just stayed motionless on the bottom.       What's the best thing to do? Keep doing water changes each day? The medication says repeat after seven days. I don't want to prevent the medication from working but I want to improve the water quality as best I can.      I would split them up as I have a second small tank, but I have a brooding female in there at the moment. Not sure what to do!

Two weeks ago, she became very ill suddenly and stopped eating.  We have tried everything to get her to eat in the past two weeks.  This was our last option.  I cannot help feeling that things should have been different.  I know I should have been there when she passed.  I know I did the best that I could have done. I feel like even though the vet did all he could, I just feel like I messed up somewhere.        She was my first pet.  I love all animals, but her and I really knew each other.  I just feel like I didn't do enough.  I feel helpless.

20090226172858AAGXkcZ	Pets;Reptiles	How can I care for a lizard?	I work at a nursery and am constantly weeding, today I found a lizard that was too cold to run away. I grabbed it and put into an empty Gatorade bottle, I poked some holes and it managed throughout the day.      I live in Southern California and have no idea what this lizard is. Some said feeding it flies and crickets is what they eat. I went to a pet store and some lady there said it was a horny toad, but now that I looked up some pictures, that's not what it looks like.      If I had a camera, I'd take pictures, but I don't. Someone threw a ladybug into the Gatorade bottle, but it didn't eat it. I have it in a 2-gallon tank because I can't afford anything bigger at the moment.      Can anyone tell me some basics on how to care for any general lizard? Maybe a website that can help identify the lizard? It was about the size of a 20oz Gatorade bottle, the tail is pretty long about the size of its own body. I thought it was a bearded dragon at first glance, but I know its not.

I know with horses and dogs the herd or pack will try to eliminate the older or weaker members to benefit the group. is this the same with rats?    I have 4 rats and they had all been getting along quite well but yesterday the three younger ones were picking on my older rat, there was a lot of squeaking and running around. When i got to the cage they were surrounding her and she was on her back. She's about 2 years and a few months. She's becoming kind of thin and slow, the others are about a year now and bigger and stronger.    Should i separate them? Do rats kill off weaker members of the group?

My young Pekingese (Lola) escaped from our house the other day and made it 5 miles down the road until someone picked her up.  We were called the next day and picked her up from a women who claimed her car went over Lola, but the wheels just missed her.      After picking her up, Lola has been incredibly grumpy and does not show the love she did before running away.  She does not lick like she used to, and seems upset all the time.      Also, and maybe this is most important:  She has pooped in her cage the last 4 nights.  She NEVER did this before running away.      The people we picked her up from seemed a bit white-trashy.  They had large dogs that seemed very aggressive.      But we have searched Lola for bites or marks (thinking maybe skimmed by a car) but have found nothing.  Her stomach seems tighter than usual, but that could just be my mind trying to find something wrong?      Any idea on why our precious little girl is acting this way?       Thanks in advance.
20090226181647AAJPf6E	Pets;Rodents	I need a guinea pig expert for this one!?	Okay, so about 2 days ago I noticed that my guinea pig was digging in the corner of his cage, until you could see the bottom. I put a lot of shavings in, because I want him to be comfy, but he dug right to the bottom. Then today when I got home from school, I could hear him making lots of noise so I went over and his whole cage is a mess. He's been digging everywhere, and he's eating the newspaper lining his cage. He also tends to throw hig pigloo around but not all the time. I was just wondering, is the digging a sign of stress? Or is there something else wrong? Or is he just being a pig? Here's some background info on him. He was born with no brothers or sisters, and has pretty much lived a life of solitude. I know that guinea pigs are always supposed to have a buddy, but unfortuneately he hasn't gotten along with the pigs we've tried him out with. I always make sure to give him 90% of my attention, and there's always someone home all day and they play with him and feed him and give him lots of love. He is 2 years old, he'll be 3 on August 4th, and he is a dark brown and gold abyssinian. He is a total cuddle-bug, and loves people. He loves being outside [when there's NOT snow on the ground] he's in a very big cage that is meant for 3 guinea pigs, and he's in the living room/dining room with the kitchen right next to it.   Anyway if anyone could help me out that would be great.

Yesterday we noticed she was very fluffy and today she was still fluffy and lethargic.  She didn't eat all day, as far as I know, and constantly sat, fluffed up, with her eyes closed.  Cassie (a.k.a. White), is her sister and while usually the Alpha bird, she was very kind to Yellow, nuzzling up to her and scratching her head.      I took her to the vet tonight and they are keeping her because they think she has an infection.  Her poop is a dark gloppy green and is sticking to her bottom.  The vet said that parakeets have a high mortality rate and was concerned about her weakness.  However, they'll be treating her with antibiotics and will tube feed her tomorrow if she still doesn't eat.      I'm so worried that she won't make it through the night!!!  Has anyone out there been through this?  Is there hope???      Thank you,   ~Amy

I have never cut a mane before so I will need a very descriptive answer. Also is there maybe a way you could cut the mane strait and then cut vertically to make it look more natural? Pulling is not an option and I do not own a thinning sheer. If you could also describe to me how to use a thinning sheer maybe I could find one at the barn to borrow. But I would rather figure out how to do it with the dematting comb. My horse has a really thin mane so I do not want to make it any thinner.

I want to write down the lyrics and parts of this song so my 2 friends and I can sing it, but I can't figure out who sings what lines.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c80iBHFkz...       I'm pretty sure Carole sings the first two lines, then Lisa sings the next two lines, but after that, I get confused.      Could somebody please write down the lyrics and who sings what parts for me?      THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!! I will love you forever if you do this for me! (well, not really, but I will so greaty appreciate it)
20090226191826AA7VGd8	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat pee the floor?	We have a two year old cat that we've had since he was born. My mom's cat had the kittens and we were living with her at the time. We didn't have any problems until we moved into our apartment. He didn't start peeing the floor until a few months after we had moved in. We've been there a year and a half. We have his litter box in a spare bathroom and that room is just for him. I don't know what to do with him. I just know I'm really getting tired of it. Not only does he pee on the floor but he recently started peeing on the stove!! Can anyone help me? He hasn't been neutered, would that help my situation?

She tries to keep it closed a lot and it keeps watering and gunky, and when I looked at it real close I noticed it was starting to get a haze on it, kind of like a greyish blue color. I'm really worried and afraid she's going blind or something. I love my baby, someone please help me, any suggestions, is there anything I can do without taking her to the vet? I've been using a warm cloth to keep it clean but I don't know what else to use.
