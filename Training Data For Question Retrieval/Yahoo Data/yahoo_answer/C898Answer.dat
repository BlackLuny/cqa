You have to make one which outlines everything your business will be about and the future funding needed and cash flows for several years.<br>  <br>  I happened to be lucky and know friends from college who learned all about this kind of thing. So I asked them. <br>  <br>  I wish I knew what to do for someone with no resources or connections, though. I am curious.<br>  <br>  So, maybe if you can't really find out about it, think about studying Entrepreneurship at College in Business. That is where they teach you how to take an idea for a business from the brain to the real world.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|16b1a5cb0fdeaf282be15ebefffc2a04aa	Dearest,<br>  <br>  I know how dificult it is to begin, biz is about money. if you can count the dough then you r already a biz person. Begin with something small, never let anyone tell you it's dificult. Don't let anyone still your dream.
zKn9IXygaa	Here are some steps:<br>  Step1<br>  Choose a tightly focused theme or niche for your online store around something that you are passionate or knowledgeable about. By focusing on a specific theme for your store, you'll garner a competitive advantage over other stores that are larger and forced to be broader in nature. This specific focus will give your store more credibility, and will position you to provide detailed information about certain kinds of products. Customers will appreciate the level of coverage you provide on a given subject, which will be helpful for making purchasing decisions.<br>  Step2<br>  Choose an underlying infrastructure for your online store. One fast and free way to get started quickly is to open a Zlio store.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://setup.zlio.com" rel="nofollow">http://setup.zlio.com</a><br>  <br>  With Zlio, you'll be able to sell products from buy.com and other brand name merchants and earn a commission on every sale. You'll also get about half the advertising revenue you generate through Google Adsense. The upside of Zlio is that its fast, its intuitive, and its free, so you can see what its like to start an online store without spending any money on upfront costs.<br>  <br>  Another reasonable option for starting a free online store is CafePress.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cafepress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cafepress.com</a><br>  <br>  With CafePress, you can start an online shop for free selling merchandise that you design [like customized t-shirts, posters, bumperstickers etc] and then generate earnings paid out monthly.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if you're willing to pay a monthly fee, some folks like Yahoo Merchant Services.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce/">http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce...</a><br>  <br>  With Yahoo, you'll pay a monthly fee in exchange for the framework of an online store. The upside of Yahoo is that you can sell, carry, and fulfill your own inventory of products (rather than outsourcing it through Zlio or CafePress). The downside of Yahoo is that, well, you get to sell, carry, and fulfill your own inventory of products.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I'm going to give a quick mention to FlyingCart, which offers a service similar to Yahoo's but with less expensive monthly fees.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flyingcart.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingcart.com</a><br>  <br>  With FlyingCart, you get the basic architecture/framework of an online store and generally have to pay a monthly fee less than that of Yahoo. There are also some interesting social networking features. It lets you sell, carry, and fulfill your own inventory.<br>  <br>  All things considered, we recommend that folks start by setting up a Zlio store and then take things from there. Zlio is free, which makes it a good way to learn about starting an online store. <a href="http://setup.zlio.com" rel="nofollow">http://setup.zlio.com</a><br>  Step3<br>  Build-out your product inventory. Be careful to put the best products at the top of the page. Product placement counts and studies have shown that products placed at the top of the page tend to sell the best. Keep your inventory of products fresh. Try to write reviews that will help your customers make better puchasing decisions. Stay true to the theme of your store. Stay focused.<br>  Step4<br>  Promote your store. Remember, this is not Field of Dreams. "If you build it they will come" will not apply to our new store! As entrepreneurs, its up to us to generate interest in our own online store. You should strongly consider writing some helpful articles about the products in your store and publishing them [give squidoo a try for this]. For instance, on my hot sauce store, The Hot Sauce Collector, I wrote a series of articles about The Hottest Hot Sauce In The World. These articles help my customers find the hottest hot sauces and consistently drive traffic to my site.<br>  <br>  Reference:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/thehottesthotsauce/" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/thehottesthotsauc...</a><br>  Step5<br>  Manage and track your web store.

Pjm9pg7iaa	They are not hiring. That "open" job is to fill future openings; there is nothing open today.<br>  Of course, you can call again but it is important that you keep applying for jobs and never look back.<br>  Teenagers always apply at jobs they know- retail and grocery stores. Those businesses get 100 applications per week. Find a zoning map of your city and locate the industrial areas. You can find a job there. It might be loading a truck or answering a phone but you will work..|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	Dummy: you don't get a job on the telephone. Nobody gives a job to someone THAT LAZY. WHATTYA GONNA DO, PHONE IN THE WORK?? You want a job, go and fill out an application. Won't? Starve.|`|Wfe2VXTfaa	I would wait a week and see if they call back by then.  If they don't call you back I would just drive to the place and ask for a job application or that your interested in getting a job there.  Then just fill it out and hand it in, and hope for the best.
hh9hoMA2aa	Checks are issued from a checking/current account which you open in any local bank. You have to maintain a minimum amount (usually P10K for peso account) monthly otherwise you will be charged a P100 for below minimum balance. It earns interest of 0.5% if you can maintain certain amount as balance (e.g. P50K) per month.<br>  <br>  The rule of thumb in owning a checking account is not to issue check when you have no sufficient fund or when you have closed the account. When you do, the charge for unfunded account is P2,000 epsos + 200 per check per day. Then you could also get charged under bouncing check law if you don't pay up after your creditor demanded you to pay the amount you owe him.
5BTKscZraa	Accurate negative information can be reported for 7 years....They are not obligated to remove accurate information from your credit files...The items will have to fall off naturally in 7 years....sorry.<br>  <br>  What you can do is request validation directly with the credit bureaus and hope that they can't validate:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act you have the right to request written validation of negative entries on your credit files. Per this law they must validate the item(s) within 30 days or remove them from your credit file. Mail a letter via certified mail with return receipt to all three credit bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion & Experian). Include a photocopy of your driver's license and social security card...If you don't include these, they may write back requesting them, which would slow the process down by several weeks. For each negative item, write a separate letter and simply include the phrase:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I am requesting written validation of this item.<br>  <br>  Do this one at a time for each negative entry....DO NOT request validation for all items at one time.<br>  <br>  There is NO guarantee that this will work....It may give some decent results. The worst that can happen is that all negative items come back verified.

I've met all of my best friends working at Dairy Queen, and even my BF of 3 years that I'm probably going to marry. <br>  <br>  It's a fun job, just don't let your friends get you in trouble at work. Like, if they are doing something wrong, don't take part in it. The best friends you have will be the ones you work with in my opinion. <br>  <br>  At my store we go out after work a lot, and hang out like go to Taco bell when we close or something, and our boss lets us hang out in the parking lot during the summer. it's really fun! =)|`|Zonu3PsLaa	I have been working in the food industry since I was 16, about 10 years. I have met tons of people who became really close friends and even some boyfriends. I just want to warn you to BE CAREFUL!  It's kind of complicated having a lot of friends at work. Especially if one gets promoted or if you have a problem outside of work that gets brought into work.  I don't know if you have ever worked in a restaurant before and I don't want to scare you away from trying to make friends, but there is a fine line between being friendly with someone at work and being close friends. And it depends on the type of person you are dealing with. Focus more on doing the job than building relationships. But be yourself and have fun while you do it!  Just talk to people and if you click with someone it's okay to be friends with them but just remember there is always the potential for drama. I have met some great friends at work over the years that I  still keep in contact with, but I have also seen the negative side of being too cool with everyone and getting too comortable.   I just lost the job I had for five years for something stupid a friend and I did at work and there was a lot of drama and cliques involved. So I just had to point that out. Keep it separate as much as you can but have fun!!
xkz8Logfaa	I believe it would be better to le the financial systems fail for themselves and let the cycle follow its course. Bailouts only prolong recessions.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	Once a decision is made to stray from the realm of the possible to the fanciful, there is no basis for comparison. Who has enough money to bail out the bail-outers? I hear that China is getting into the bail out game also.  Aren't they the guys who were going to buy all our debt? Can even China carry its own load and everyone else's as well?<br>  I fear that our leaders have been reading comic books too long and have lost all touch with reality.|`|jAg4AdbTaa	The UK isn't doing anything different than the US. Both still have a problem with toxic assets on the books.<br>  <br>  RBS is a real sick puppy and probably in worse shape than Citigroup. Lloyds is also in very bad shape due to its purchase of HBOS.<br>  <br>  Although Barclays and HBSC have not yet gotten government help, they both appear to be in pretty bad shape. If you want to invest in UK banks, I would invest in preferred shares instead of common shares.<br>  <br>  Preferred shares for Barclays (BSC- or BCS-A) is currently yielding about 33% dividend taxed at capital gains rate. Preferred shares for HBSC (HFC-B, HBC-A, or HCS) is currently yielding between 15%-31% dividend taxed at capital gains rate. They are also selling for a large discount (about 1/3rd to 1/5th of face value) so a large possible capital gains is possible.<br>  <br>  But be careful since any of those banks or any bank around the world could go under causing either common and/or preferred shares to become uselass.
XtclYSd8aa	Think of it as more quasi-military.  You live at the facility and your day is structured so you will be getting up at a specific time with everyone else, eating with them, studying at certain times, etc.  The benefits though are quite extensive.  You get training in a specific field, a certificate upon completion which can be shown to employers, often you'll receive a beginning set of tools to get you started (Hand tools, computer software, it depends on your field of training), you receive a financial stipend while your there (kind of like a weekly allowance), and assistance finishing your HS Diploma or getting your GED (if you need it).  Additionally, they do have scheduled time for extra curricular activities such as sports and games.<br>  <br>  The real question is "Can you handle this short term pain for the potential long term gain?"  With the economy in shambles, Social Security quickly becoming a thing of the past, and employers demanding more in the way of experience and training from potential employees; any edge you can get will only help you.  Would it be better to work a minimum wage, entry level job (perhaps in the fast food industry) barely being able to make your rent payments much less paying for and finding the time for college?  I see people all the time that go this route and it's not any easier.  Think about it.

Until then, keep it in a savings account.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://investopedia.com/dictionary/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://investopedia.com/dictionary/defau...</a>|`|2TtPf4BSaa	Seek professional advice from your banker or a financial advisor at a reputable investment firm.  Don't invest too much of your money but now is actually a very good time to invest in the market.  You can pick up good quality equity for very little.  Since you are young and have time on your side you will be able to start building a small portfolio now and watch it grow when we get out of this mess in the next few years.  <br>  <br>  Just remember that the money you invest will be tied up in the market.  You can redeem at anytime but may end up paying some taxes so going back and forth isn't worth it.   If you can part with a few hundred dollars, that would be a good starting point because you won't be risking much and can start picking up some shares for pennies on the dollar.  <br>  <br>  Remember the age-old saying ''buy low, sell high''...the market is the lowest its been in years so take advantage of some great deals.  Just do your research and make sure you work with someone knowledgeable and trustworthy.  Make sure your investments are diverse and again think long-term, not with fear.  <br>  <br>  The media exacerbates every situation for a good story.  I'm not saying times are not the toughest since the Depression, and they will continue to worsen for the forseeable future, but something good can come out of it.  First, people will start living withing their means once again so that the Money Masters can't victimize the people as much, and secondly, you can set yourself up to make some good gains over the next 5-10 years when things rebound.  They always do, so hang tough, be smart, and most of all be a wise investor...never a gambler.

y3ncYsS1aa	Dear Concerned parent<br>  <br>  First of all congratulations on your firm resolve to secure your child's future. <br>  <br>  I would recommend you to look at fortifying child's future through a combination of a term plan for yourself and a ULIP for your child (with riders of critical illness and accidental death/dismemberment). Term plan will come at a small cost (Betweeen 4 to 6k Per annum for your age) but will provide a huge sum to your family in case of any uneventuality to your life or health. Currently, you are underinsured considering the perils your profession. <br>  <br>  Aviva Life Insurance's 'Life Shild Plus' offers one of the most competitive mortality rates in the market.<br>  <br>  This should be complemented with a ULIP plan with Income benefit and waiver of premium rider/options along with competitive charges and a well balanced fund portfolio. Again, Aviva's 'Young Scholar Plan' provides good return and a lump sum fund value corpse upon maturity. However it also provides riders, death cover and regular income till child attains the age of 18 in case of uneventuality to parent (life covered).<br>  <br>  Though child's age is not mentioned, but landmark for your child will be at the age of 15y (high school), 18y (graduation), 21y (post graduation) hence a plan like 'Aviva Young Scholar' allows flexibility of partial withdrawal to provide funds for any of the three stages. <br>  <br>  You would also need to review your child's insurance considering marriage between 23 to 25 years.<br>  <br>  Both the above plans allowes you monthly mode of payments to ease out monthly options to pay for premium(... but may be slightly expensive) but don't think too much and delay any further.|`|HIim1HR9aa	At this please don't go for MF.

The lending company isn't going to take your word for it that you can pay them off in September when you get your check. They have no reason to believe you.  You can certainly try, but each inquiry into your credit report (especially ones that end up denied) just lower your score even more.|`|PxoKseAiaa	What kind of check are you waiting for?

cku5S9WLaa	If you enjoy business then do business. Don't walk into a career for the sake of money because if you don't enjoy it, you won't succeed.|`|kiYtI0jBaa	If you want to build a career, I say one concentration that definitely pays big money is accounting. Personally, I think that it's one of the toughest concentrations to complete. If you are serious with it and take the CPA (certified public accountant), you can definitely, definitely make bank. Like, no lie. My friend's father owns an accounting company and his company is still doing good in this economy. <br>  <br>  I say, go for accounting. But only if you're good at all that math stuff. <br>  <br>  Another track I would recommend is marketing. But you have to really know your stuff. People pay big money to have their products advertised, but you have to stand out in order to get the high-paying positions. A lot of people misunderstand the advertising industry. They think that it's an easy job and you don't get paid much. WRONG. completely misleading. Because product owners are willing to pay in order to increase their sales, they will pay big money for the best people to create a campaign. <br>  <br>  If you study Internet Marketing, you'll definitely get paid a lot. Most of the work will be on your own too & you'll have a lot of flexible. Because we are relying so much on the cyberworld now, internet marketing is and will be in even greater demand in the future. I'm not lying about this. I'm doing affiliate marketing right now. I started 6 months ago earning about $1350 the first month. Because sales keeps going up, so has my income. I earned $2000 something the following month. Last month, my check came in and it was $9836. There's a lot of money that can be made with online marketing. I'm still in college as well and I'm saving up for grad school. <br>  <br>  So...I hope this helped you! Oh, and if you want to learn more about online marketing, I definitely recommend checking out www.themavericksociety.com   <br>  <br>  That's where I got started with online marketing and definitely well-worth the investment. Hope you figure out your career path.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|FnfoP2MEaa	work at home<br>  <br>  This System is the hottest, cutting-edge system in the Network Marketing Industry.Yet, the program is easy to learn.

XZG35fxSaa	Yes, any surprises that are announced while the market is closed can cause a price gap on open.   But it's difficult to get a good price on an after-hours trade.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	I think that the question is moot. Analysts do not wait for the last minute to post their expectations which are built into the pre-announcement price. In my opinion, it is unclear whether the price movement after the announcement is a judgement upon the company or the analysts.|`|jAg4AdbTaa	Usually it will not rise since it was expected that the company would report those earnings so it was previously built into the price. However, if the company reports 50 cents or 10 cents when 25 cents is expected, generally the stock price will open much higher or lower since it exceeded or missed expectations.
PxoKseAiaa	You would need it to be a steady 2 years.  You would need to prove that that person actually is sending it to you.  I highly doubt they are going to take your word and the divorce or legal decree stating this person owes you so much per month, as a lot of exes do not pay, or pay regularly.  So you would need proof for a period of 2 years that they have been paying.<br>  <br>  I would think if it started in Jan 09 that isn't enough of a track record to know if this person is going to default on you.|`|AA10045620	Afraid that this would not be enough.

5e557df1d845989aa4abaec75c368fdbaa	The Annual Report, or 10-K in investor parlance, is the summary of the company's operating performance in a given year. The first page of any annual report (apart from the glossy marketing material) is a standard page identifying the dates that are covered, the number of outstanding of shares, and the given value of the shares.<br>  <br>  It is generally useful to have a minimum of 5 annual reports for a given company: the 10-k of the given year, the 10-k from some prior year (best if it was an especially tough last year), the 10-k of a competitor from the same year and also from another prior year, and a 10-k from a company that does business with your company. <br>  <br>  Why so much reading? The point is to get a perspective on how the company is doing business. The annual report typically has a section called the MD&A, or manager's discussion and analysis. Read this! It gives an idea of what the numbers mean in the given economic enviroment (or at least, it should make things clearer...what is management considering, reporting, etc?) <br>  <br>  The next section of real importance is the financial numbers: look for the balance sheet (and look sharply at the numbers!). Does the company carry a lot of debt? Does the company have adequate credit? What assets are being claimed? (lots of accounts payable in liabilities? Lots of accounts receivable and little cash? Etc.) <br>  <br>  Then, turn your eyes to the Income Statement. How is the company making money? Do you know the company's model? Strategic advantage, or 'edge'? Do the numbers make sense? (Here is where having prior statements helps, or having a competitor's statement helps.) If the company says it will grow earnings by 20%...is this claimed by its competitors as well? Maybe the whole market is growing (excellent!) Or maybe the market is shrinking, but this company is tough as nails. <br>  <br>  Finally, check the Cash Flows. Though this is a short-sighted look at a company's operations, many investors like to see this because it is hard to really cloud the cash picture. You either have cash, or you don't. <br>  <br>  Start by reading a book like "Financial Intelligence." It will help you go through more of the finer points of the annual report. Look on www.footnoted.org, the lady there has an excellent book on reading annual reports/quarterlies and spotting financial 'red flags.' Michelle Leder's "Financial Fine Print" is excellent. <br>  <br>  Then, look at your company's "footnotes." Remember always that the annual report is a "PR communication" from the CEO / management to investors.**Think critically!

He can arrange for the lease obligation to be fulfilled in, say, 5 yrs, i.e. over 60 instalments. Every month when he pays an instalment, he has to break the instalment into 2 parts for his bookkeeping - the repayment of principal and the interest element. There has to be an interest element, cos who will allow you to take 5 yrs to pay up without charging you interest? Some countries call this a hire-purchase arrangement.

I don't think you have much to worry as far renting a place to live.<br>  <br>  I would seriously consider going back to in court and trying having your criminal record expunged considering your age at the time of the crime and if you haven't had any problems with the law since then.

OCVFrgeXaa	I assume you're in the UK?  There are differences in products in the US and UK, even if they share the same generic name.<br>  <br>  Whole of Life insurance usually has an investment element because we don't know when you are going to die and the cost of life cover is more expensive as you get older.  The (hopefully) increasing fund value subsidises the increasing cost so that your premium stays reasonably constant.<br>  <br>  Term Assurance<br>  Pros<br>  - cheap<br>  - guaranteed premium<br>  - sum assured can be level or decreasng to match interest-only or repayment mortgage<br>  - benefit is tax-free<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  - you don't get anything back if you don't die during the term<br>  - if you die after the policy has expired, you get nothing<br>  - inflexible.  Cannot usually amend term or sum assured etc during the policy term<br>  <br>  Whole of Life<br>  Pros<br>  - insures you for the rest of your life.  It inly ends if you die or stoppaying premiums<br>  - flexible.  Sum assured and other policy details can usually be changed during the life of the policy<br>  - if you no longer need the policy, you may get some money back<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  - you may have to pay tax if you surrender the policy and get some money back, if you haven't had the policy for long<br>  - most WOL policies have an investment backing.  If the funds don't perform in line with original expectations, you could end up having to increase premiums or reduce your sum assured<br>  - commonly people confuse unit-linked WOL with a savings policy.  This is wrong.  It is life insurance with an investment backing.<br>  <br>  There are very few convertible term assurance policies in the UK, so I would disregard that answer.  They're just not competitive or suitable for most people.<br>  <br>  WOL is not a rip-off, but whether you need WOL or term depends on your circumstances.  The bottom line is, both are insurance policies.  Why would you expect money back if you don't claim?  You don't for car insurance, buildings & contents insurance, holiday insurance etc.<br>  <br>  Apart from the misconception that WOL is a savings plan, the most common issue is that the funds don't perform well and you have to pay more premiums.  Provided this is explained and understood at outset, and you pick the right fund(s), this shouldn't come as a shock if it happens.  However, there are one or two companies (Skandia, L&G) who are offering guaranteed premium WOL policies for consumers who don't want to take any risk.<br>  <br>  Whether to go for term or WOL depends on what you are insuring and why.<br>  <br>  For example, typical term assurance uses are mortgage/debt protection or to cover the cost of rasing children until they become financially independent of their parents e.g. 18 years.<br>  <br>  You might use WOL for inheritance tax planning or to cover funeral costs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|SrkpdglRaa	Whole life is a rip off.<br>  <br>  Basically, a whole life policy will allow you to build 'cash value'. Typically, the policy will take the money that you put into it and invest it. You'll pay fees for this service. You'll actually pay higher fees than you would if you would go to a wealth management expert to open straight brokerage accounts. Insurance is not an investment. It's insurance. If you want to invest, go to a investment expert, not an insurance agent.|`|O1TekaXDaa	whole life policy means, u have to pay premiums till the end or ur life and after ur death ur family or beneficiary get the money or sum assured.<br>  <br>  while term policy is for specific term like 25 years, 30 years so on, in that if u will not died not nothing will come back and all ur premium goes to company, and if u died ur family get the sum assured, in this some life insurance company offer the additional rider of premium back, that means at the end of term if u dont died then the return all ur premium paid without any interest or bonus on it.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	Whole life is a ripoff because you're spendng more than you need to insure your loved ones against the loss of your income if you die. They tell you "it's savings!" So put it in the bank. They tell you that you can borrow against it. Nice deal: you borrow money YOU put in and pay THEM interest. Real smart. For what you'd spend on $25K whole life you can buy $200K in term. If you died your family wouldn't care about all the other crap--they'd want to know where the other $175K is--wouldn't YOU?|`|NmshFbxhaa	if u r young just get a convertible term policy
aKhZNd7daa	All I can say Paula is that 10 Years ago a Housing Association wanted to take over all our Borough Council Houses.  We were all sent a letter and a video outlining their proposals ie - Only minimal rent increases every year and speedier repairs etc.  2 months later we then received a ballot paper to vote whether to keep them as Borough Council Houses or transfer to this 'new' Housing Association.  The Housing Association won and to be fair in this their 10th year they have kept to all their promises. Repairs don't bother me really as Hubby is a Builder/Plumber Carpenter etc so he does ours but with neighbours I know their is now a 24 hour turn-around from original telephone call to report a problem to them coming out to you and if they can't fix it there and then they do it within 3 days.  As for Rent Increases again they kept their promise - I received my letter 2 weeks ago telling me what my new Rent would be from year commencing 6th April 09 and it has only gone up ￡2.58 per week which isn't bad in this given day and age and economic climate.  However you know where I live and our Council Tax has gone up heaps for this next coming Financial Year and yet again the highest Council Tax in London !!!|`|396f017f9409bc4d7e22a267e6a23b7baa	our council transferred its housing stock over to a housing association a  few years ago and we had no problems. <br>  the housing association was set up specifically by the council so it wasn't transferred over to an existing group.<br>  i had my Kitchen and bathroom remodelled 2 years ago and they look fantastic.<br>  i received my rent increase letter yesterday and my rent is still under ￡90 per week for a large 3 bed house.<br>  hope this helps|`|04bSzgxgaa	Yes I have....... I believe Glasgow was one of the first to do this in Scotland. (I could be wrong though). At the first stage there were lots of uncertainties and questions, not to mention promises. On the one hand there has been lots of money spent on renovation and this has been welcome although the upheaval has been difficult. All those repairs that were suspend have now been sorted. Not to mention the demolition of substandard housing to make way for new projects, a mix of rented and owned properties. It has meant though a waiting game while the renovations have been taking place. The Glasgow Housing ***. has assisted in setting up smaller local housing associations to manage and run the the new housing stock and the level of rents has been fair for the moment. The problem as I can see it for the future though is that many of the smaller associations are now fair game to be swallowed up by bigger and more manageable groups and the feeling in my nieghbourhood is one of lost control and uncertainty about the future. As part of much larger Associations who take in wider areas the feeling is that much of the financiers may go to the up keep of vacant and refurbished properties and the communication process will in time deteriorate. We no longer have the right to buy and it now looks as though rents will increase by a bigger percentage than before.|`|7bb17ba0d239bccce9d108823363a0f2aa	Suggest you check out the tenants views on transfers that have already taken place. Just google housing associations and look at a few - the good ones will have tenants forums for discussion.<br>  <br>  They are usually set up as non profit charities and the rent increases are still dictated by government legislation. <br>  However often what can happen is that the same people who were working for the council wind up running the transferred housing stock - and they are also in control of what they are paid. Also those transferred have pension rights which the new association is obligated to meet.<br>  So costs can still be high but you will see a rapid increase in quality in most areas.|`|NKuQh4sSaa	In Manchester quite a few council estates have been transferred over to Housing Association and that could only happen with the tenants say so. Each household was given a vote for or against the transfer.  My grandmother is one of those  whose house was transferred and the things that they have done is brilliant . She has been given new windows,front and back doors , new central heating system , a new kitchen and bathroom as was promised by the Housing Association. They have even improved the outside appearance of the estate she lives on also. She has had no greater rent increases than if she would still be with the council . Any repairs that need doing are done quite quickly , usually within the week. And another good thing about Housing Association is that they are a bit more tougher on anti-social behaviour , as they are not that keen to have the problem families as tenants. The estate that my gran lives on was pretty rough and now it is a lovely estate to live on .

AA10666701	You are still unknown to the credit word. The only time bills and such go on your credit is when you don't pay them. Credit cards and loans are the types of things that will make it to your credit report.<br>  <br>  The other thing is that you don't have to guess about whether you have credit or not. Just look at your credit report. The government makes all 3 bureaus give you a free copy each year. Go to www.annualcreditreport.com<br>  <br>  Check out the book Smart Debt if you feel like doing some reading on the subject. Also, it takes 6 months of having something on your report for you to be given a score, so you will probably still need a cosigner with a years worth of credit (young credit).|`|iNTZpVZ7aa	I went through the same process almost two years ago.

Also if your credit cards are close to the maxed out limit can lower your credit score if they stay there for too long.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	The things you listed are either not reported to the credit bureaus, or are only reported if you default on the payments and they are sent to a collection's agency (like medical bills).

qPZPduLXaa	In general, you should have a goal to have ready cash available to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. Try to get that credit card debt paid down, but I wouldn't suggest using your $10K savings to do it, unless you have other savings to draw on.|`|4f3GfrN6aa	Warning.   Maths content.<br>  <br>  Okay, so you have ￡10000 earning you 6.5%, which will be about ￡325 from now until August.  Only problem is that interest is taxable income.  So if you pay tax at a rate of 20% (I'm an Australian, so I'm not sure what your tax rates are like) that means you will only get ￡260.<br>  <br>  At the same time, you have a loan costing you around ￡680 a year, and a credit card debt that could cost you ￡1155 a year.  So by keeping those savings in the account, you're losing ￡1575 a year, or ￡30 a week.<br>  <br>  Unless you really love giving money to banks, I suggest you take that savings, and put it on the credit card.  Clear that credit card debt first. <br>  <br>  When clearing debt, you must always get rid of the highest interest rate debt first, while paying minimum repayments on the other debts.  That will save you the most in interest.  If you take that ￡10000 savings, and put it on the credit card, you'll still have ￡3000 left over.  That means you can put it on the other loan.  You'll then reduce your debt bill to ￡476.  You won't have any savings earning you interest (which is taxable) but you'll be only paying ￡9 a week in interest.  <br>  <br>  Kill the debts as soon as possible.

XtclYSd8aa	It certainly sounds like you have a difficult problem. Here's a few things to consider which may help:<br>  <br>  - Before deciding that one experience is better than another you have to look at the career you want. Many job fields today REQUIRE a degree to truly get into them. You mother's line of thinking was very true about 30 years ago, but much has changed since then. Do you really want to work at an entry level fast food type job just to get the work experience necessary to become a secretary at a company that may train you to be an accountant one day? This plan will likely take you 3 time as long to get where you want to be and may not eliminate the need for a degree.<br>  <br>  - How long will you really stick with a job you don't like (especially in an environment you don't like). You already walked out on the academic plan your parents set up (the right move if you weren't happy). Ask your parents how great you're work experience will look if you can't hold down a job for more than a year because you're not doing what you love. No employer wants a worker who bounces between jobs all the time.<br>  <br>  - Ok, a degree means you'll be 26. It's not like you'll be 50 or 80. Three years isn't a big hassle to most employers. Their main concern is finding the best fit for the job (most of the time this does not mean the youngest since younger employees are often seen as immature and unreliable).<br>  <br>  - Who says you're going to work in Hong Kong for the rest of your life. Look at different countries (Including Australia) for a better fit. Different country means different culture and thus different employment rules.<br>  <br>  - You can get a part-time job while your in school (maybe even an internship with a company that will hire you upon graduation). This will allow you to get both the educational AND work experience for your resume.<br>  <br>  - Most importantly is this: What do you want to do with your life? While you should always strive to honor your family that doesn't mean doing what they want you to do. You have to make your own decision. This means deciding what your long term goals are, setting a path to reach those goals, then walking the path. Who knows, when you reach the level of success you aspire to your parents may become more accepting upon seeing both your success and happiness. If they can't accept this than politely inform them that you are a grown man who has made his decisions and they will accept it if they want to stay involved in your life. It's a tough move, but also critical for your family to start thinking of you as an adult instead of a child.<br>  <br>  This is a tough situation.

You study - that makes up for the work expirience.<br>  You could consider to have a part-time job in the study field as well, so another reason why the argument is invalid.<br>  <br>  ( I studied till i was 25, did part time jobs in between, never got worse because of it)<br>  <br>  I think advantage of Australia #1 is one of the biggest ones.<br>  You are not accepted for who you are at home - and that has an impact on your self esteem, confidence, and therefore study results.<br>  <br>  Disadvantage #1 of Australia - see my comment above.<br>  Disadvantage #2 of Australia - higher cost, but also higher wages for part time jobs. It all more or less balances.<br>  #3 - see #1 and above comment.<br>  <br>  While work expirience is good, the paperwork to back up any claims are usually recognized in other countries as well. If you want to move to somewhere else (like the US, or Europe) an Australian degree is probably worth more than a hong-kong degree. (Made in Hong Kong is in Europe not exactly the mark of quality)<br>  <br>  Given the points you made, i would advise you to go back down under, and do some serious studying.<br>  the DJ thing, and driving (a car, i presume?) is probably easier in Aus as well.<br>  <br>  Your self development, and your being able to be you, is in my opinion of greater value than staying home. <br>  Between the lines you almost scream "I want away from this place".<br>  <br>  Btw - the original meaning of the word 'gay' is happy. You will not be able to be 'gay' in more than one way, if you stick in Hong Kong. (At least, i do not believe you will)

8AuljIIOaa	There are different reasons people will refinance a car loan. The three main reasons are to remove a name <co-signer> from the loan, pull possible equity from the loan, or most common, to lower the current monthly payment. Here is a brief explanation of trying to lower your payment:<br>  <br>  Also, a good place to check is...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://autoloan.lowratetoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://autoloan.lowratetoday.com/</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|S2FxmvXJaa	It can really save you some money to just get an automobile loan quote on the web to check out what the going rates are.  You might be pleasantly happy.  Also if your credit is not so great, a lot of them are more willing to help you.<br>  <br>  What I most often tell folks is that an online quote at <a href="http://autoloan.saverightnow.info" rel="nofollow">http://autoloan.saverightnow.info</a> is worthwhile.|`|sij7xeVIaa	You really don't want to do that. Cars depreciate really fast so you probly owe more than what its worth.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	The catch is the economy. Although the banks got money so they could make loans but they are not doing that with the money they got. Your credit score is kind of in the middle, so that doesn't help and the fact you have made your payments on time doesn't really count these days.<br>  Good luck.|`|Gzqrc3Rcaa	It may be worth it to refinance if:<br>  <br>  1. you get a significantly lower rate<br>  2. there aren't a lot of fees to refinance (like you get with a mortgage refinance)<br>  3. you plan on keeping the car for a while longer<br>  4. you don't extend the term of your loan.<br>  <br>  If all 4 of those things are in place then I say go for it, otherwise it probably wouldn't make sense. You should especially think about #4 because a lower payment will be more attractive, but if that lower payment is the result of adding 2 more years onto your loan that just means you're turning it into longer-term debt and the car will be worth less than what you owe within a few months. What you may save in your actual interest rate doesn't make a huge difference in your payments, so honestly what I would do if I were in your shoes would be just keep the existing loan and maybe even pay a little extra each month to pay it off quicker and cut down interest payments.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!

bFRVSDteaa	To avoid a penalty next April, you should be sure that withholding from your wages in 2009, plus any estimated tax payments you make for 2009, come to at least the lesser of 90% of your total taxes due for 2009 or 100% of your total taxes due for 2008.   If the rest of your income is relatively stable, your regular wage withholding may cover that minimum payment, especially if you reduce your W-4 allowances to bump up wage withholding.  If not, you should make quarterly estimated tax payments by 4/15/2009, 6/15/2009, 9/15/2009 and 1/14/2010.  That is done using the payment coupons in Form 1040-ES, which you can download from the IRS website.

xwPI2e9raa	First and foremost stop all transactions with this payoff company. If i understand you correctly, you paid 5K and 60 a month and then another 1K per month. What are those fee for? How much debt is there?<br>   Anything they can do you, you can do yourself. There are many ways to deal with your creditor and simple ways to get the to stop the lawsuit for a little while about a month or two. This will give you a little time to get things in order. There are also way to get these these items remove completely. You have to know your law. The cc companies have teams of lawyer on there side, until you use the law you will not get anything accomplished. All creditor and collection agency have to abide by the FCRA and FDCPA. They both know these law but most average joes don't. Depending on who is actually suing you, you sent out either a 623 letter or a Debt and Validation letter. This will give you at least a month or so before they can do anything due to the fact the law states they must not contact or take any action against you until the results of the investigation is completed. Once you send them this letter they have 30 days to respond. If they don't respond they are required to remove the debt. By understanding the law you can prolong this for quite some time. he other fact is that if this debt is older you may have even better odds of getting it removed. A lot of these companies purge the records every couple of years. If they can not prove the debt belongs to her they have no legal aspect to try to collect.<br>  <br>  I do want to say that it is to hard to tell you exactly what to do on a answer site like this. Depending on who holds the debt and what the circumstance are regarding the debt would dictate what you course of action should be. Things like is the Original creditor holding the debt, or a collection agency, is the debt SQL(out of legal time frame for you state,) how much is the debt, is the company willing to accept a PFD(Paid for deletion) and so on.<br>   I can point you in the right direction if i knew a little more about the debt. I had something like this happen to me and I was able to resolve it. If you want more info on this, email me from my address in my profile, the only reason being I would want you to post that kind of info on an open forum and it is going to have to take a few emails to get you the right info.<br>   Hope this helped|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	She should have worked something out with her credit card companies instead of working with scammers.  They just hold her money while skimming their fee and then try to negotiate with credit card companies to settle for a lower amount.  But the card companies do not have to accept that (and many do not).<br>  <br>  So she has already trashed her credit by not paying the cards.  And they can still get judgments against her.  Good luck getting her money back from the scammers.|`|Gzqrc3Rcaa	Those payoff 'companies' are all crap. They'll save your relative some money once the credit card companies settle, but at the expense of her credit. Basically every creditor will show as a charge-off (but paid) on her credit report once everything is done. The idea is to stop paying all of them, let them go through all the motions (e.g. filing a lawsuit against her), and eventually settle for a percentage of the original debt just to be done with it. <br>  <br>  The credit card payoff company isn't really a scam, but it's not the best way to go about getting rid of her debt either. I would start with the attorney who is dealing with the creditors and ask him/her how to get out of the credit card payoff contract that she most likely signed. Probably not a lot she can do, but worth a shot.

Try to answer the question and don't turn the answer into what you want to say.<br>  <br>  When they ask you if you have any questions this is not just a formality - they want to hear you ask sensible things (not about wages or holidays etc.) but about future prospects, available training etc. Be enthusiastic about the company and the job.<br>  <br>  Finally, best of luck and please wish me the same on the interview I just had - aged 57 been out of work 4 months, need to earn and, at last, it's my dream job!<br>  <br>  Tell me about yourself. <br>  <br>  What are your strengths? <br>  <br>  What are your weaknesses? <br>  <br>  Who was your favorite manager and why? <br>  <br>  What kind of personality do you work best with and why? <br>  <br>  Why do you want this job? <br>  <br>  Where would you like to be in your career five years from now? <br>  <br>  Tell me about your proudest achievement. <br>  <br>  If you were at a business lunch and you ordered a rare steak and they brought it to you well done, what would you do? <br>  <br>  If I were to give you this salary you requested but let you write your job description for the next year, what would it say? <br>  <br>  Why is there fuzz on a tennis ball? <br>  <br>  How would you go about establishing your credibility quickly with the team?<br>  <br>  There's no right or wrong answer, but if you could be anywhere in the world right now, where would you be? <br>  <br>  How would you feel about working for someone who knows less than you? <br>  <br>  Was there a person in your career who really made a difference? <br>  <br>  What's your ideal company? <br>  <br>  What attracted you to this company? <br>  <br>  What are you most proud of? <br>  <br>  What are you looking for in terms of career development? <br>  <br>  What do you look for in terms of culture -- structured or entrepreneurial? <br>  <br>  What do you like to do? <br>  <br>  Give examples of ideas you've had or implemented. <br>  <br>  What are your lifelong dreams? <br>  <br>  What do you ultimately want to become? <br>  <br>  How would you describe your work style? <br>  <br>  What kind of car do you drive? <br>  <br>  Tell me about a time where you had to deal with conflict on the job. <br>  <br>  What's the last book you read? <br>  <br>  What magazines do you subscribe to? <br>  <br>  What would be your ideal working situation? <br>  <br>  Why should we hire you? <br>  <br>  What did you like least about your last job? <br>  <br>  What do you think of your previous boss? <br>  <br>  How do you think I rate as an interviewer? <br>  <br>  Do you have any questions for me? <br>  <br>  When were you most satisfied in your job? <br>  <br>  What can you do for us that other candidates can't? <br>  <br>  What are three positive things your last boss would say about you? <br>  <br>  What negative thing would your last boss say about you? <br>  <br>  If you were an animal, which one would you want to be? <br>  <br>  What salary are you seeking? <br>  <br>  What's your salary history? <br>  <br>  How do you want to improve yourself in the next year?<br>  <br>  What were the responsibilities of your last position? <br>  <br>  What do you know about this industry? <br>  <br>  What do you know about our company? <br>  <br>  How long will it take for you to make a significant contribution? <br>  <br>  Are you willing to relocate? <br>  <br>  What was the last project you headed up, and what was its outcome? <br>  <br>  What kind of goals would you have in mind if you got this job? <br>  <br>  Give me an example of a time that you felt you went above and beyond the call of duty at work. <br>  <br>  What would you do if you won the lottery? <br>  <br>  Can you describe a time when your work was criticized? <br>  <br>  Have you ever been on a team where someone was not pulling their own weight? How did you handle it? <br>  <br>  What is your personal mission statement? <br>  <br>  Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback.

6GULDLO1aa	at 765 in this economy is almost a sure fire thing from a respectable dealership, car sales are down its not unlikely for them to get a 600 approved with a large down payment.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	Most banks consider anything above 720 as very good to excellent and will give you the lowest available interest rate.  If 765 was not a typo there had to be some other reason why you weren't approved.  I think if you asked they need to give you the reason.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	It's odd that you wouldnt get a loan on a new car with a credit score that high.  I, personally, think it's worth trying again but not until you pull your credit reports so you can see what the car dealership is going to see.  Inquiries onto your credit report DO damage it, but only by a point or two. If your loan request is denied again, then you need to figure out what is on your report that is causing the problem, and fix it.
XxUsLqXRaa	First of all, make sure that you read somewhere on the contract that there is NO PENALTY FOR EARLY PAYOFF.  Don't just take the salesman's word for it.....he has no say-so over the bank's financing decisions.  After you buy the car and you want to start making higher payments than what you're obligated to, the amount that you paid above and beyond the $100 should be applied automatically towards the car's principal amount.  It never hurts to actually write on the monthly statement "Payment=$100<br>                              Additional Principal=(whatever)<br>  Some statements will already have a blank on them that you can fill out with the additional amount you're paying, but not always.  Keep a close eye on your statement and make sure the balance is going down in accordance to what you are paying.  It probably wouldn't be wise to continue with the payments and just wait to pay it off as soon as you have the entire balance in your savings account because, in the meantime, you will have spent hundreds on finance charges. If, on the other hand, you went this route anyway, when you have an adequate amount in your savings account, you should call the finance company and ask for the pay-off amount.  They should deduct the remaining interest charges and just tell you the amount needed to pay off the principal.  But, like I said, for each month you're putting money into your savings account, you're still being charged an interest fee.  Commit to the lowest monthly payment you can (in case you have a bad month and cant pay anything extra), but when you have a good month, send in as much as you comfortably can towards getting the balance paid off.  Also, just FYI:  credit bureaus consider loans under 2 years old to be "new" loans and are, therefore, not helpful in establishing or rebuilding credit.  They want to see a credit HISTORY, and that history needs to be about 2 years.  Taking out a loan one day and repaying it a few months later does not show an adequate history.  It will still make it on your credit report and will look favorable to anyone who actually takes the time to look, but it wont effect your overall FICO score.  Your plan is a great way to get a car without having to pay a ton of interest, but it isnt going to do anything towards rebuilding your credit.|`|rQVs0sB1aa	No, if you pay that car off early then you save interest on it. It is calculated on a daily basis. So the sooner you pay it off the better off you are! Get it paid and save that amount that they are charging you to punish you for bankruptcy and that is what they do! <br>  Now you will not get a refund because you are paying it off because all is calculated in the payments, but you do save a ton when you pay it off because the calculations are monthly so  the sooner, more money for you and your credit looks better as well. In other words you save having to pay all the interest that is with the total loan amount.<br>  <br>  So pay it as soon as you can.|`|lCn6wJZ1aa	It might really save you time to just get an auto loan price online to see what todays rates are.  You might be really happy.  Also if your credit is not the best, a lot of them are more able to work with people.<br>  <br>  What I always tell folks is that an online quote at <a href="http://autoloan.saverightnow.info" rel="nofollow">http://autoloan.saverightnow.info</a> is the way to go.
sK5QVPnUaa	I think if you are doing during day time then you are right and if your downstairs neighbour have so much problem then let them complain to association and they can sort it out. But i think the one viable solution is to use a carpet or some sort of cushion which will reduce the noise/thumping|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Both are.<br>  You share a building with people - so a little consideration should be expected.<br>  <br>  What you could consider is putting some extra padding under you when working out.<br>  Cork floor plates for example dampen a lot of sound.<br>  If you can do two layers of that, hardly any noise should be heard at all.<br>  <br>  Another solution could be to ask a friend to do the workouts, while you visit your downstairs neighbor, to hear how loud things sound.<br>  Then, try again with the extra padding - and ask your neighbor if that noise level is acceptable.<br>  <br>  You are sharing the same building, so try to get along. In the end, everyone will be happy.|`|ULOyxt2waa	You have the right to dance but you do not have the right to disturb them at any hour.<br>  If you continue to do so you will eventually be fined and evicted if your neighbor continues to complain. <br>  <br>  Why don't you think about how you would feel if someone above you kept making noise.|`|8eb45b4c6ee01d5f00ffcb946d4ea1d1aa	you have a right to work out in your flat. I might be incredibly annoying to your neighbours, but nothing they can do, except complain and maybe slash your tyres or snarl at you when they see you.<br>  Try to be a good neighbour and let them know that you are related to Fred Astaire!|`|j6xOco5Maa	Actually you have the right to do whatever you want inside your apartment but knowing that you live over other people's apartment you have to be careful with what types of activities you do while in your apartment. If it's an all the time noise, at not reasonable hours for them e.i. they work during the night and sleep during the day and they can't sleep because you're working out, well I think you have to be a little condescending with them and do some other type of exercise like yoga. I don't think dance workouts are good for second or third floor apartments.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	You have the right to do what you want in your apartment.  Your neighbors also have the right to quiet enjoyment of their apartment.  Causing excessive noise is most likely a violation of your lease.|`|HvFIHu3saa	join a gym or you will find yourself homeless.
ikXRqWxUaa	it's a matter of simple supply and demand.  there is an abundant supply of homes for sale, and it's harder for potential buyers to get loans.  therefore, more homes sit unsold.  this is especially the case in hawaii, which has a very high cost of living and real estate values have plummeted.|`|AA10045620	The house is beautiful, however, it is the price range that is stopping people from buying.  Not that it is over priced or anything, but it is a lot of money, and in today's economy, not many people can qualify or have the down payment for it.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	If it's not selling, then you're not $80,000 under market. If it's not selling, you're overpriced. Period.<br>  <br>  If it's an investment property, I just need to know what my monthly payments as an investment property would be, and what I can rent it for. Period.<br>  <br>  As an investor, I'm not going to buy it conventionally. Still, if you took back financing at, say, $2,000 a month and I could rent it for $3,000, I'd buy it. Any investor would.<br>  <br>  But selling to a retail buyer: You're overpriced. Have your Realtor do a CMA (competitive market analysis).<br>  <br>  A couple of other quick observations: Your YouTube link doesn't work. And all the photos (both the MLS listing and the Craigslist one) are exterior shots...and the Craigslist ones don't even make the house look that good. Your Craigslist posting talks a lot about the interior; people want to see that. And your Craigslist posting really needs to be edited for grammar and spelling.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|Ovj9hjMPaa	In a buyers market there are more potential sellers than buyers.  So naturally it's harder to sell.  With the economy the way it is, with all the spending, uncertainty and unemployment, its no wonder your having a hard time selling.|`|o10Vmrzbaa	your advertisement is not prominent enough for people to say yes|`|U3jZFawtaa	Aloha! First thing is to be aware that lending has been tight the last few months so although it is a buyers market they are getting their hands tied by the loan shortage. Photos DOOOOD!!! hehe.She is right interior photos and nearby beach photos are needed. How are you taking care of the selling agent? Agents are getting thrown incentives (top percentages) to sell a home these days so if you are on a 3% commissions agreement that might be a concern. Next, is looking at incentives to the buyer. Are they competitive with what everyone is is doing? Closing costs rebate, carry back a 2nd or other incentives are the norm right now. Carrying a 2nd isnt a bad idea if you have the equity because the market WILL come back so getting 8-10% is better than most investments. I can go further but its off the point. Next is your internet exposure. I cant find your agents site so that means you are not getting enough traffic to your listing. I see its on zillow but if you had it on a top real estate site (on google , msn and yahoo) you would get more interest. It seems like your broker isn't prominent in your area. That is like a tree in a forest...in your case if no one sees it no one knows you are willing to work a deal. So get photos, package the offer so the agents and buyers perk up and get it on more sites and/or make whats called a listing website (www.13419piedragrandepl.com) and promote it on google using pay per click. Cheap to use now that you can only advertise the days and hours you want.
60YOy0rHaa	Where does the "elevator" come into play? lol. Ummmm- you should market something that totally already exists, but just describe it as if it's never been invented before. Something really common that everyone has. I think that would be really funny. I hope this helped.

EGkSkOEKaa	If taxes are not paid, and no effort is made to pay them, the IRS can ask a taxpayer to take action to pay the taxes, such as selling or mortgaging any assets owned or getting a loan. If effort is still not made to pay the bill, or make other payment arrangements, the IRS could also take more serious enforced collection action, such as levying bank accounts, wages, or other income, or taking other assets. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien could be filed that may have a detrimental effect on a taxpayer’s credit standing.<br>  <br>  Payment Plans, Installment Agreements<br>  <br>  Whether you call it an installment agreement, payment agreement, payment option or a payment plan, the idea is the same — you make payments on the tax you owe. That sounds like a good deal, but you can save money by paying the full amount you owe as quickly as possible to minimize the interest and penalties you’ll be charged. For those who cannot resolve their tax debt immediately, however, an installment agreement can be a reasonable payment option. Installment agreements allow for the full payment of the tax debt in smaller, more manageable amounts.<br>  <br>  And now for a little perspective.<br>  Ever hear of a Chicago Gangster named Al Capone?<br>  <br>  On October 18, 1931, Capone was convicted after trial, and on November 24, was sentenced to eleven years in Federal prison, fined $50,000 and charged $7,692 for court costs, in addition to $215,000 plus interest due on back taxes. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/capone/capone.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famca...</a><br>  <br>  My advise, bite the bullet, file Form 9465 Installment Agreement Request, available at this link-<br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f9465.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f9465.pdf</a><br>  <br>  Then get some reliable tax advise from an advisor at H&R Block to help you avoid owing taxes in the future.<br>  <br>  Deni<br>  Tax Advisor Level 3, H&R Block|`|XZG35fxSaa	You can't go to jail for failing to pay your taxes.  You can go to jail for lying about your taxes.<br>  <br>  If you do nothing, they can take you to court, garnish your paycheck, or freeze your bank account.  So your best bet is to talk to them and try to set up some kind of payment plan.|`|CcgDj9GIaa	You can go to jail.|`|mm89vskTaa	I'm not going to win any popularity contests.  It is better to file your taxes and make a payment plan with the IRS than not file. <br>  <br>  Even if you do not have to file a return, you should file one to get a refund of any Federal Income Tax withheld. Use the first link to read "Do You Need to File a Federal Income Tax Return? "  <br>  <br>  The second link let's you complete your Federal return for FREE!  If you can't afford to pay for the State software I'd fill out the free State provided forms based on the info in your Federal return.  Hopefully you will have a refund! <br>  <br>  The third link is the IRS's advice if you can't pay your taxes in April. <br>  My advice is: The IRS has been known to write off debt owed to them for using phrases like destitue, no potential income, disadvantaged, etc.

iNTZpVZ7aa	If he is working for his dad, his dad is legally obligated to get him his wages on payday.

1HLIKuTvaa	In the United States, there are three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. These three bureaus provide credit reports and scores for all individuals with a social security number who have opened a line of credit or a loan. Canada's credit bureaus follow the same procedures.<br>  <br>  In Canada, the three major credit bureaus are Equifax Canada, TransUnion Canada and Northern Credit Bureaus, Inc. In several scenarios, people have found that the United States TransUnion and the Canada TransUnion share the same data in their systems. In result, there may be a possibility of a Canadian financial institution pulling your U.S credit history. This could be good for people with positive credit and bad for those with not so good credit. Equifax may do the same and share their data between countries. It has been found that Experian has no effect in foreign credit because it only conducts reports on U.S residents. The same applies for Northern Credit Bureaus and its Canadian residents.

If it says zero amount owed, don't worry about it (obviously).

I once got a solicitation for a card that charged all the above mentioned fees, so that meant I was going to owe $240 right of the bat, before I ever even got a chance to actually USE the card!!!

Then, Beta new = 1.8822 (or 0.9411 x 2).<br>  <br>  With the new Beta, the new Expected Return E(r) = 6% + 1.822 (8.5%) = 22%.<br>  <br>  Because the price of the security is currently equal to $50, the new expected price would be $61 [or $50 x (1 + 0.22)].

XxUsLqXRaa	The $1000 will become part of your down payment so, on the date of closing, you will be asked for the remaining $9000.<br>  <br>  Do not put down the entire $10,000 as earnest money.  If something unforeseen happens and you find yourself having to back out of the deal, you'll forfeit the entire $10,000.  (If the house does not pass inspection and you back out for that reason, you get your money back.  But if your husband loses his job, or something bad happens, and you back out on your own accord, the seller gets to keep the earnest money for his troubles).   <br>  <br>  Also, like the previous poster mentioned, don't forget that you'll need an additional several thousand for closing costs.  Your lender should be able to give you a fairly accurate estimate of what those costs will be based on the purchase price of the house.<br>  <br>  Where I live, sellers wont even consider an offer unless there's an earnest check attached to it.  They aren't interested in wasting their time with buyers who don't appear interested.  And, hopefully, you have already gone through the qualifying process with the bank.  (Not the approval process....there's a big difference!!)|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	The earnest money or deposit is part of your down payment.  Don't forget that you need additional money for closing costs related to your loan.<br>  <br>  Make sure you include any contingencies you feel you need in your offer (like selling your current home, able to get financing under specified interest rate, etc.).  Otherwise you may not get your deposit back if you back out of the deal or cannot get a loan.  So don't volunteer more deposit than they request (I think my deposit was $1000).

wHGYVFIQaa	you do not get a bill for a debit card it's just another way of using you bank account to make purchases|`|XxUsLqXRaa	All a debit card does is take the place of paper checks.  Aside from the fact that it is plastic, there's no difference.  Each time you use the debit card, you still need to write it in your checkbook ledger, just like you would if you had written a paper check.  The money comes straight out of your checking account, and is usually instantaneous.  You don't get a "bill" because you're not accumulating a debt like you would with a credit card.  You're paying in full, out of your checking account, with each transaction you make.  If you don't keep it all written down in your checkbook ledger, you can easily become overdrawn.  Debit cards usually have a visa logo on it and can, indeed, be used to make a purchase at a place that doesn't take checks but will take credit cards....so, in that respect, it can ACT like a credit card but it will still always be deducted immediately from your checking account.

XxUsLqXRaa	My opinion for you would be to buy some books and LEARN what you're doing before you do it.  Try the "Idiots Guide to Home Buying", or "Home buying for Dummies".  Both are written very clearly and, by the time you're done reading, you'll be ashamed that you were even thinking about making the biggest purchase of your life without having a clue about what to do.  I'm not knocking you---I tried once, uneducated, and nearly got way in over my head.  The next time I found a house I liked, I was well-armed with information that I had read from those books.  The loan went smoothly, and the whole purchase experience was over in about 2 weeks.  Neither the lender nor the real estate agent is working for your best interest so you are pretty much on your own.  Without any knowledge, you're a sitting duck.<br>  <br>  Anyway, a foreclosed home is a house that the bank basically repossessed and is now termed "bank owned".  A short sale is what the home's owners will sometimes try to do to keep from totally ruining their credit.....they work with the lender and convince them to take a little less than what is owed on the house, and the seller walks away with nothing.  They dont make a penny off the sale but at least they are out from under the payments and their credit isnt damaged too bad.  The bank makes a little less money but it's still more than they would have made if the house sat vacant for any length of time.  In a foreclosure, the owners are basically evicted (or have abandoned it) and it's now up to the bank itself to sell the house.  I have not heard anyone say anything about foreclosed homes being any cheaper than short-sale homes, or visa versa.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	i would agree with the first poster.  with your current level of knowledge, you would be well served to get yourself a buyer's agent.  resist the urge to go it alone as you could find yourself in over your head.  <br>  <br>  a foreclosure means that the previous owner has defaulted on the loan and the bank has used their lien to take over title on the home.  they now own it, and the previous owners are out of the picture.  <br>  <br>  a short sale is where the owner sells the home for less than is owed on the mortgage w/ bank approval.  the bank then agrees not to come after the owner for the deficiency.  <br>  <br>  both have their pros and cons and both can take quite a while.  in the case of foreclosures, they are often in bad condition as some owners will trash the place in a misguided fit of revenge.  they are also usually sold "as-is".  <br>  <br>  again, take my advice.  find yourself a good buyer's agent, who has experience dealing with all kinds of properties, including short sales and foreclosures.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	A 'foreclosure' is a home which has been legally repossessed by the lender involved for mortgage non-payment.  You deal with the lender as the actual seller of the property, since they now own it. Typically, you are buying 'as is'.  Lenders don't usually make any repairs to these houses, preferring to negotiate purchase price to cover costs of any needed repairs.<br>  <br>  A short sale is one in which the homeowner still owns the home, and has asked the bank for permission and agreement to sell the place for less than is owed on the mortgage(s).  Negotiations are similar to that of conventional homebuying, except that the lender must approve any offer to purchase (because the lender is taking a loss)  Short sales can be tedious and downright time-consuming.  Lenders seem to take their good natured time about approving or denying offers, sometimes as long as 90+ days from the date of offer.  Lender stance is to wait for several offers to be made, so they can choose the 'highest and best offer'.<br>  <br>  If you elect to look at 'short sales' be sure that the real estate agent you select is well experienced in such sales, and can fully explain all the pitfalls you may encounter along the way.  An unpleasant ploy used by some 'short sale sellers' is to put a 'below market' price on the property, drawing numerous buyers.  Thus offers to purchase are obtained, and the lender generally counters the offers because the asking price was far too low in the first place.
6yHQxmhOaa	Branding and awareness is totally right. You can target geographically in high traffic locations. On highways, generally the message needs to be a quick read -as you're moving fast, don't have a lot of time to look away from the road, and can't guarantee a long read... but since you're getting front of a ton of eyes, it tends to be a good medium. Also, it's generally seen when in the car, which is close to the point of purchase -so if you hear it in combination with Radio, that could be a really good thing. The only thing is there's a lot of waste (meaning hits people outside of the target) so it's not entirely efficient unless you have a really large target. Smaller billboards tend to be on side roads, as opposed to highways; generally at stop lights or busy intersections where the read time can be longer. Posters are more for pedestrian traffic, on sides of buildings or construction sites -another version called wild postings is more of a guerilla tactic using posters... it can say a bit more than just a branding message, such as driving to event or website to take more action. Target is a bit more engaged with posters.|`|lHqBKydnaa	Branding and awareness.  The more often someone sees something the more they recognize the logo, tagline.  Often the recognition is subconsious so when the individual sees a product with that specific branding, there will be some recognition of it and typically it is enough to assist with the decision making in making a purchase

AA10464818	Wow, that's a lot of money<br>  <br>  Some banks extend what they call "small business lines of credit" often through credit cards. Those are easier to get and can be based on your credit history alone. They typically are up to $100,000.<br>  <br>  For example, Wachovia's has various business lines of credits <a href="http://www.wachovia.com/small_biz/page/0,,446_612_1399,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wachovia.com/small_biz/page/0...</a> Their business line of credit can even be approved overnight,<br>  <br>  However, if you're applying for a loan and if it is a big amount, banks and even the SBA may consider other factors aside from your business credit:<br>  <br>  - A business plan explaining what the business is<br>  <br>  - Your background and experience in the business -- in my experience, this is KEY in the eyes of the bank because they want to make sure that you know what you are doing and that you can make the business work. If you don't have any experience with the business, have someone on board that knows the business to give banks assurance that someone will guide you<br>  <br>  - Your credit factors because it shows your dependability and how well you handle credit. They will do a credit check on you and poor credit history may be frowned upon, or even reason for the disapproval of your loan application<br>  <br>  - Your collateral. Banks, even SBA guaranteed loans, want the borrower to show collateral. They want to be guaranteed that somewhere somehow they can get payment from you<br>  <br>  - Condition or terms of loans. Banks would want to know three important things: "How much money are you requesting? What will it be used for? and For how long will it be needed?" Banks oftentimes prefer to approve loans for items that can be identified, has lasting value, and can be repossessed and sold if things fail.<br>  <br>  - Equity investment|`|aJp3BbWcaa	* Application (pdf) (doc) completed and signed by all business owners and guarantors.<br>  <br>      * Three years of personal tax returns and a current personal financial statement for all owners of the business.<br>  <br>      * Two years of business tax returns, if already in business and a Profit & Loss statement along with a Balance Sheet not more than 60 days old.<br>  <br>      * Business Plan for all start-ups<br>  <br>      * Financial projections of the income statement for two years, showing the assumptions behind the numbers.<br>  <br>      * Copy of the DRAFT lease or buy-sell agreement for the business location (please do not sign a lease or agreement until you have all the resources you need to operate the business!!)<br>  <br>      * RBAC will conduct a personal credit search for all owners and guarantors of the business upon receipt of signed applications.

AA10779574	The Chinese market is extremely price sensitive, and COMPUTERS have become a commodity business, as Lenovo's purchase of IBM's PC biz demonstrates.

Deduction for tuition fees is available up to Rs 100000. This limit is the total limit under Section 80C for all types of savings, under Section 80CCC (pension policy), and under Section 80CCD (contributory pension plan). The aggregate amount of deduction cannot exceed Rs 100000<br>  <br>  The relevant part of Section 80C: "(xvii) any sum paid as tuition fees (excluding any payment towards any development fees or donation or payment of similar nature), whether at the time of admission or thereafter, a) to any university, college, school or other educational institution situated within India; b) for the purpose of full-time education of any of the persons specified in sub-section (4)". Sub-section (4) specifies in case of an individual, any two children of such an individual.<br>  <br>  So, based on this definition, tuition fees would mean the total fees paid to any university, college, school or educational institution for full-time education. It will include admission fees. However, late fee charges, transport charges, hostel charges, mess charges, library fees, and parking charges will not be covered. Private tuition fees will also not be included as the fees are not paid to any university, school, college or educational institution. Coaching class fees are also not covered.

However, it may be affiliated to any foreign institute. No course is specified. But the tuition fees should be for full-time courses only. No deduction is available for part- time or distance-learning courses. Deduction is available for tuition fees paid for any two children. So if an individual has paid tuition fees for his own studies, he will not be eligible for deduction under Section 80C.<br>  <br>  Deduction under Section 80C is available to either an individual or Hindu undivided family (HUF). But the deduction under Section 80C for tuition fees is available only to an individual and not to an HUF.<br>  <br>  Note that the deduction for tuition fees is available on payment basis. In other words, it qualifies for deduction under Section 80C in the financial year during which the payment is made irrespective of whether the fees pertain to the current financial year or earlier or subsequent financial year. Both mother and father can take the benefit under Section 80C for amount paid by them respectively. If the husband has paid tuition fees of Rs 125000 for his son and wife Rs 50000, then the husband can avail deduction under Section 80C of Rs 100000 and wife can claim deduction under Section 80C of Rs 50000.

4UBxVIYFaa	A buyer's agent working for you is highly recommended. There is no actual difference in the agents and their licensure.  However, in nearly AL states, unless you contract an agent as a buyer's agent, the agent is required to best represent the interests of the SELLER, and not your interests.<br>  <br>  There is generally no cost to you, since the buyer's agent will normally accept same 'portion of commission' he would have earned as a non-buyer agent, from the listing agent/agency.  The only time there is a commission cost to you is if you desire the buyer agent to seek out for you homes not listed for sale with brokerages (For Sale By Owner).  Even in such a case, a good buyer agent can typically induce the seller to pay such commission.<br>  <br>  For further information, read the supplied URL, which is the website of the Real Estate Buyers Agent Council (a division of the National Association of Realtors)|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	no they charge too much............|`|XxUsLqXRaa	If you can afford it----yes.  Always remember, the real estate agent is NOT working for you.  She is working for the sellers.  They are the ones who hired her, and are paying her.  She has THEIR best interests in mind....not yours.  While I don't think she will totally screw you, it's her duty to get more money for the sellers which (obviously) will come at your expense.  Besides, the more she sells the house for, the bigger her commission.  A buyer's agent works 100% for you and will not let any unnecessary charges through.  I don't know what they charge, and no one knows beforehand how much they can save you, but it could very well be more than worth it.  However, the cheaper route would be to buy books and educate yourself.  A buyer who doesn't have a clue is a gold mine to a real estate agent and to a lender.  I always recommend the "Dummies" and "Idiots" books.  I read the "Idiots Guide to Home buying" and learned a TON.  It's written in very plain English and doesn't assume that you already know anything.  With a decent amount of education, you can effectively serve as your own Buyer's Agent.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	the buyer's agent looks out for your interests in the transaction, even though they are being paid from the proceeds of the home sale.  a sellers agent is looking out for the sellers interests, not yours.  especially if you are not familiar with the process, you should definately get a buyer's agent.   what you don't know can cost you big time here.

6LPeWXYuaa	How many real estate agents are you talking about?  Were these the Listing Agents (the ones on the "For Sale" sign)?  Or, did you have several agents showing you properties that were not their listings, but rather they were trying to help you find *the* home to buy?<br>  <br>  If these were the listing agents, then your generous gesture is not necessary.  They were doing their job in showing you the houses they had listed for sale.  They represented the Seller, not you.<br>  <br>  Is it typical in your area that real estate agents just work in selected parts of town?  Why did you feel it necessary to have so many agents?  My comments on this type of action are too long for here, but realize that you used up their time, energy and resources for naught.  They may have missed out on actually earning a living.<br>  <br>  I think a gift card to a cafe/restaurant would be a nice gesture.  But, along with the gift card, please send a very gracious note about the service and care they offered you.  Let them have something they can REALLY use... your testimonial.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	As the first answer says, it's a nice gesture. While it's not expected, there's nothing wrong at all with doing that.<br>  <br>  Technically, the gift will have to be approved by the agent's managing broker. In practice, though, that's not a problem. You give the gift--and a gift certificate would be fine--and the agent gets his/her broker's approval. No hassle.<br>  <br>  In addition to something like that, here's something the Realtor will really like: A nice letter of recommendation. Even if you didn't buy through that Realtor, a letter to the effect of: "I worked with Ms. X. She was helpful, thorough, and professional. I'd recommend her without hesitation to anyone considering buying a home" would be a great gift. The agent will include that in his/her presentation package, and it just might help him/her get other clients. Just use your own words and be honest.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	It's a very kind gesture but I don't really think it's necessary, nor expected.  They get paid by the sellers to show homes to prospective buyers so they were just doing their job.  Since the start of the MLS system, realtors can sell homes that are listed with other real estate agents and, if the home sells, the commission is split between the lister and the non-lister.  If the home doesn't sell, to be honest I don't know if the non-listing agent who showed it to you gets anything out of it or not.  But that's just part of the job.  It's dog-eat-dog when it comes to buying a house and you HAVE to do what's best for you, even when it comes to picking out the agent.  Again, it would be a nice gesture and I'm sure it would be appreciated but, chances are, they've already forgotten about you and moved on to the next potential buyers.|`|U3jZFawtaa	First I would send each testimonials about how they helped and what you liked about their service and that you would recommend them. They can use it on their website and promotional material. Next, a personal call explaining how you feel and that you are having a "Thank You" dinner party or get together. Realtors love recognition and parties and I bet them all meeting in a party atmosphere will have them networking and possibly starting relationships with fellow agents that will lead to something fruitful in the near future. At the very least they have recognition they can put on their websites and promotional material and a great night of food , drink and laughs.<br>  <br>  ****extra info you gave**** well it sounds like some didnt really help. Here is the deal, agents are like dating....they bounce around till they find a good fit...sometimes they help you sometimes they help you by showing you what you dont want in an agent. From their standpoint? "its a numbers game" and especially in this market they either click with you or they move on. Here is what they wont tell you. They expect to be used. Buying a home is not like a car or groceries, its a hard process to go through and when you are in what they call "discovery" stage they expect to do some footwork that may not turn out for them. If they helped you by showing you an area that you didnt think of but you used another agent because they were more in tune? Send them a little something with a big thank you. If you felt like you were at the DMV with the kind of response and them not really being tuned into your needs? Don't bother because in their mind you were one of the wrong numbers in their numbers game mentality. Thank you card with a few sentences as to why you liked them and their service along with flowers sent to their office so others can see will have for the ones that helped but didnt get the commission will be a big deal to them. True agents do it out of wanting to help and giving recognition is adding to their emotional bank account.

UdICTUnaaa	well its your funeral.... you seem too dumb to sell weed but here goes<br>  you can get the bags from a smoke or pipe shop, you are too young to get in probably, otherwise you have to use sandwich bags, which means you would have to get a scale, because im pretty sure you cant eyeball it   i'd keep the large amounts in zip lock bags. and then inside a plastic container like a butter bowl with a lid<br>  ok so heres the break down of average price<br>  <br>  quarter pound, (4 ozs) for $200-250<br>  you can usually get an oz (28 grams)for 70-90 dollars (regular weed)<br>  half (14 grams) for 35 -45 dollars<br>  a quarter (7 grams) goes for 20-25 bucks (25 is standard)<br>  a dime is just under 3 grams and goes for 10 dollars, 2 for 15 is a good deal and will make you money<br>  a nickle bag is enough for 2 not large joints. you can sell nickle bags 3 for 10 and make decent change<br>  <br>  to make any money at all, u would have to buy oz's or quarter pounds and sell nickle or dime bags. otherwise u wont make much money. if you buy an oz for 80 bucks and sell 4 quarters at 25 bucks each, u will only make 5 bucks a bag.... and if you sell dime bags, you will break even... u wont make a profit, you'd have to short your bags to make 10 dime bags out of an oz, which would make them 2.4 grams each, which isnt really that short. but u still can only make 20 bucks off a whole oz. selling weed really isnt a money maker unless u are buying pounds<br>  <br>  *disclaimer* i am not contributing to a minor, i do not sell, purchase, or advocate the distrubution of marijuana<br>  <br>  so what you're saying is that you are only 12 or 13 years old, you've already sold weed and got caught and you want to do it again? <br>  <br>  you could make a lot more money mowing lawns, all profit and all legal<br>  you are going down a very bad path|`|mncI3TB8aa	dollar general has the sandwich baggies youll need. get some scales. and 1 gram= a blunt= 5$ so on so forth. emai me for more info|`|X94VKR0Laa	weed market can be quite competitive, due to the recession, if i where you, i would check out some of the local dealers and see what theyre selling for, then start off selling a little lower that what they are selling.

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	Those most interested in viewing a 5 year financial history are those who either want to lend money to a company or those seeing to invest. Lenders rarely need a 5 year history. It can bolster the confidence of investors to see a longer history of earnings. This can be particularly helpful if a company is seeking to go public.

bafa91f49072574a56440c807ad6ff3baa	Do not install a computer as human should not be an obedient machine.  Softwares are not hard, that would soften the industry.  You can use a computer for calculation and memorise records or history.  Any other work of 'data entry' etc., would make you weak as you will tomorrow answer to your customers that 'my computer does not show' and so on. Besides, searching and finding out from a computer is waste as such records does not have any proof equal to a signed document.  Hard document is visible and easy to keep and find out where if everything is in one box, like the tool box in the old workshop, it is difficult to find out as and when required, especially during power cut.

It would save a lot of time consuming trouble and stress for you.

S6W4IMfYaa	Well well welcome to the trading world.<br>  <br>  1. Go for Reliance money -  which has no brokerage, no commission, no tax. <br>  <br>  2. Rs. 10,000 is not a small amount. I can hold volumes. There are n number of penny stocks (paisa stocks less than a Re.), but these stocks doesn't give u immediate profits, it is only for long term buyers. Instead there are good stocks fluctuating every day. Have a watch word through news, webpages etc. and u can easily make good deals every day.<br>  <br>  3. If at all u have brokerage, it is for the amount u buy or for the amount u sell only and not for your whole amount.<br>  <br>  4. ICICIDIRECT is good, but u have better sites, use www.moneycontrol.com to view your stocks (dummy view only). When it comes to trading, use Reliance money or Religare or Indiabulls. (These 3 are the best of all in order.)<br>  <br>  5. For a beginner, those symbols are not necessary, although u will come to know about it automatically when u become a master of trade.<br>  <br>  6. Everything will be provided from the company u trade with, Reliance money has got no software, but uses its web pages only. www.reliancemoney.com and other companies have their own s/w provided to u.<br>  <br>  7.www.moneycontrol.com is the best. Use it to view your holding stocks. It is just like a trade game which runs live along with the share market.<br>  <br>  8. Only during market hours. Moreover u can book it during other hours, but it will be bought only during markets opening and if your price matches.<br>  <br>  9. U can buy as much as u want, it checks with u purchase limit u hold before it confirms. Number of shares floated for the day can be seen in the volume column. When we buy, the volume decreases and when we sell it increases.<br>  <br>  10. Everything is with a click of a button, u can convert from intraday to delivery (interday). You dont have to inform the broker.<br>  <br>  11. Go for moneycontrol.com it gives accurate prices. U know the prices change within milliseconds and each and every company have their own time, that is why there is price variation. Stick to your broking companies price, ultimately, u r going to buy for that price only,<br>  <br>  No body earns just like that, everything has hard work within. Analyse and work on it. Buying small share does not allow u to sit in from of the monitor looking at markets daily as it will increase by 1 paisa or 2 only, which wont help in intraday. Study carefully and work on it.<br>  <br>  ALL THE BEST!|`|AZPDr6MSaa	when you dont hve any idea on share market why are u taking so much risk you will definitley lose no can can enter share market without a broker and they caharge u a lot if you want take an advantage of share market you can invest in mutual fund which also invest in market but in a safer way. for more detail mail me kb.njfundz@yahoo.com or calll 9220633450 or register with us for free seminar and free consulting.

I a currently a overseas sales in China, my job is to exporting goods. so,  I think, if possible, with small capital, I would start a small business, selling small products to overseas, like furniture, clothes, shoes or home electricals, or be a service offerer. Think and take advantage of what I can do and what sources I am easy to get. Form example I am able to design website. so, I can find out what product is profitable, then place it on my website and find out which place need this source and sell to them at good price.

cku5S9WLaa	Yeah we're in global recession. It is very very tough and can be so disheartening. My only advice is to apply for everything you can even if its not what you're looking for. I was looking for 6 months and in that time I had to do voluntary work (unpaid work) to fill the gap in my CV. Then I found a temporary job for about 6 weeks. Now after 6 months of looking I finally got a job but its only part-time but its better than nothing at this rate. I wish you all the best...Just don't give up!|`|XSXdMu0caa	it was challenging when i got my first one a year ago <br>  im stuck with it 12 hr job have you noticed there are no full time jobs aronud anymore unless you are a manager <br>  annoying|`|b5bc5824e39dfa0a703813e47659ea34aa	yes, I do.

aCDWwsisaa	Because "we" are not controlling it as a single entity...the economy is driven by the fear (and/or greed) of individual investment decisions,not by all decisions at one...|`|BlVudiyfaa	take a college level econ course|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	The financial situation was caused by greed as it was in 1929 with the Great Depression. Prices are increasing due to declining profits. Rather than increasing prices they should be lowering prices to gain a larger share of the market. It doesn't make sense to raise prices when people are having difficulty paying current prices. It is inevitable that prices will decline at some point due to lack of demand. Walmart got large by selling at lower prices and going after volume. By lowering prices they actually sold more products which resulted in more profit. It also enabled Walmart to purchase products at greatly reduced prices since they could buy more of a particular product due to their volume. Raising prices during an economic depression doesn't make any sense.|`|dPl6Al1caa	People always want more money, people need raises to feel valuable and successful, well the money doesn't grow on trees, it has to come from raising prices of the goods and services we buy.  When prices get too high, people stop buying.  When people stop buying, the economy goes into recession because when people stop buying, people stop working because there are no goods or services being purchased.   Companies try to compensate by lowering prices, sometimes to the point where they ending up going out of business just trying to survive.  Some people get scared and stop spending regardless of how low prices get, and only start spending again when it is proclaimed that the recession is over.  We have to keep spending to keep ourselves out of another Great Depression situation.

DBvjwPTcaa	You want to be treated well and to enjoy that friendly service you deserve. Customer service is a rather unpleasant occupation to say the least. However, when you have to deal with the public for a living and depend on their generosity to pay your bills, you don't have to ask this customer service question. That answer has been made clear long ago. <br>  Angry customers means no tips. No one likes to be kept waiting for their order nor do they like poor service, especially when you're paying good money. This not only keeps the patrons happy, but the boss and company as well. Poor customer service can certainly cause a customer to never return. So you ask why is customer service important? Because it pays the bills (customer satisfaction).|`|KQpT68AKaa	Good customer service gives the customer a warm feeling and is encouragement to use the particular organisation again.

What do i buy next and recommend to others? Sony! even though i have had faulty goods its the way they resolve the problem that gives you confidence in their products.
6Jgd7TzDaa	You need to pay your Rent up until the Day you leave the property. The 4 Weeks rent in Advance (Bond) is held as Security by the Landlord to cover any costs they may incurr after you have moved out. E.g. to repair damages, unpaid rent etc. <br>  <br>  It is important you keep paying the rent until you leave or you may end up with a Bad reference from the Landlord.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Oh ok, So the rent in advance is not your bond. <br>  <br>  On your rent receipt it should show you the date you are paid up to. So you only need to pay rent up to the Date you are Moving. E.g. If you are moving on the 30th March 2009 and back on 2nd March 2009 you paid 4 weeks rent in advance. then provided you were up to date with your rent on the 2nd March 2009 you should not have to pay any more rent.

a6209014abefce2c91a3088f2673dbe5aa	This isn't an area especially well covered by law so comes down to what is regarded as 'reasonable'. Obviously that varies according to the circumstances. For example, if you work for a small business, they've recruited another part-time worker to job share your role and so they don't now have a full-time job to give you, you're in difficulties. Mind you, that's a fairly rare situation. If you work somewhere fairly large then there's unlikely to be a problem. Essentially if they're able to accommodate your request to return to full-time working then they should do that. If not they should demonstrate that they have no business need for you to work extra hours. If so they should review matters if that business need changes - if they look to recruit more staff without returning you to full-time they'd have some good questions to answer. In reality they'll probably take your hand off because it helps them as much as it helps you.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest that, to begin with, you have a quiet chat with your manager to test the waters. If that doesn't go well, then it's an idea to take some advice from your union, if you have one. If you get to the situation where they are refusing this without good cause, you may need to submit an internal grievance. There should be a 'staff handbook' or similar setting out procedures for that. If there are no unions where you work, you're still entitled in law to be accompanied to meetings on this by a colleague you trust. Here it would be well worth making the point that part-time working for new mothers is not generally viewed as a permanent arrangement and so arrangements should be as flexible as the business allows. If that were to fail with still no reasonable explanation given I think your ultimate recourse would probably be taking a sex discrimination case to an Employment Tribunal - on the basis that inflexible transition arrnagements between full and part-time working have greater effect on women - who take most parenting and care responsibilities - than on men and that this is discriminatory.<br>  <br>  That's just by way of general background, I'd be amazed if things got to anything like that stage. I'd think your boss will be happy to take you back full-time - in most places there's too much work and not enough bodies !<br>  <br>  One thing though, and please don't take this wrong. If someone in my team was in this situation I'd be a little bit concerned about them and would want to try and make sure in my own mind that all was OK before supporting a request like this. Not to the extent of digging in their souls - just to be sure that they really were all right and this wouldn't cause them any problems. I know folk tend to be pretty cynical about managers - and rightly so, I suppose - but some do feel a personal responsibility for their team and want to make sure they do nothing to cause people any problems in their personal lives. Obviously I don't know the first thing about your situation and probably there aren't any problems lurking but your manager should at least be bothered enough to ask !<br>  <br>  Hope this works out for you|`|AA11206044	It really all depends on where you work but I dont see why not.

AA10223986	I'm confused here, you are the manager.  Shouldn't the assistant be under you or is she the assistant to your boss? <br>  <br>  If she is under you then she needs to understand that you are her boss, and you need to make it known, by using the leadership skills that you must possess since you are in a management position.<br>  <br>  If she is the bosses assistant, then you should have a meeting with your boss about what the chain of command actually is.  So assistants do manage to gain a lot of power.  <br>  <br>  Either way if you let her trample over you, it could cause other employees who are under you to lose respect for you since you cannot handle the situation.

It really depends on what you, as an investor, are looking for.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a brokerage firm, you must weight commission costs with platform usability, speed, & customer support.

Per cercare di mettere ordine i giudici hanno stabilito alcuni indici che aiuterebbero a comprendere se il rapporto è di tipo dipendente o no. Essi, per fare un semplice esempio, sono la presenza dell'orario di lavoro, del dovere di giustificazione, del pagamento della retribuzione a base mensile, delle ferie pagate etc...<br>  <br>  Di contro il lavoratore autonomo non è soggetto al citato articolo del codice civile e quindi è libero di svolgere il lavoro come, dove e quando crede, venendo pagato dietro presentazione di fattura.<br>  <br>  Malgrado tali elementi siano piuttosto condivisi essi sono solo indizi da valutare caso per caso nella fattispecie in cui sono inseriti.<br>  <br>  Fin qui tutto chiaro, il problema è che nella vita comune non sempre è possibile capire se questi elementi ci sono e come si qualificano, specie se si ha a che fare con contratti a progetto e cosiddetti "parasubordinati"... che mescolano la libertà organizzativa dell'autonomo con il controllo dell'opera del subrdinato.<br>  <br>  Per maggiori chiarimenti chiedi ad un avvocato giuslavorista o al tuo sindacato.|`|5wiR30HJaa	l'articolo 2094 c.c. definisce lavoratore subordinato colui che si impegna, a fronte di una retribuzione, a prestare il proprio lavoro alle dipendenze e sotto la direzione dell'imprenditore.|`|4MFEqeoaaa	appena vieni assunto e non hai nessuna carica|`|4a8bab13d3803439f12c301b8343ea80aa	confermo la risposta prima della mia.<br>  In effetti quello è il criterio ma per dimostrarlo in una vertenza vi sono altri indicatori fissi contemplati dalla giurisprudenza.<br>  Senza approfondire troppo diciamo che se il tuo capo può ordinarti il rispetto di  orari fissi, indicarti in maniera dettagliata le mansioni da svolgere ed eventualmente punirti siamo in un rapporto di lavoro subordinato.

4b06bef65f424cdae710e34b9b76bac7aa	This is going to sound crude, but I don't mean to be.  At my last place of employment I was acting COO.  I didn't make it that far by feeling insecure about making a decision.  If you are unsure you think about it and sleep on it overnight and then decide.  I have even gone so far as to do research before making a decision to make sure there will be no legal consequences.  I have always made sure that any decision I made did not directly effect any particular person to avoid employee conflicts and employee morale issues.  As a corporate manager you shouldn't be double guessing yourself in this manner.  You may be looking at a termination some where down the line when your superiors realize you lack this very essential skill requirement.  And for the record I was not fired.  I had to leave due to illness and they have been gracious enough to allow me to work from home in a different capacity, but still management.

The rest of the answers (as well as the one I just answered) can be found by looking at their 10-K.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to their 10-K<br>  <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000119312507039707/d10k.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/6...</a><br>  <br>  And here is the link to the index of related 10-K exhibits:<br>  <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000119312507039707/0001193125-07-039707-index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/6...</a>

Since you work only part time, it's unlikely that a bank would give you a loan, so your choices working out an agreement with a seller to take control of a property now and pay for it later or raise money from others to buy, then sell for a profit.<br>  <br>  When you own an investment property that you've bought correctly, you can receive a regular cash flow from rents, borrow against equity over time, and of course have a capital gain when you sell the property.<br>  <br>  There are literally thousands of books, tapes, web sites, etc. that will give you information on how to invest, but there is still no substitute for experience.  Investing in real estate is very much an experiential learning process.  I suggest you find an investment group in your area and start attending meetings.|`|ASJI4Jo4aa	Kudos to you for being so young and interested in investing!  <br>  <br>  My husband and I bought our first home at 19, first investment property at 23, and we have been so blessed by owning Real Estate, I highly encourage you to educate yourself on investing and go for it!!   <br>  <br>  We just updated our website with an informational page on investment basics:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askangie.com/investing-in-real-estate.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.askangie.com/investing-in-rea...</a> <br>  <br>  Great books to read are "Real Estate Riches" by Dolf De Roos, and any of David Bach's books.  Dolf is an international investor, so his concepts should apply to you in the UK.  The book I referenced above will explain to you EXACTLY how to make money off of properties, and leverage that money you've made to buy more properties.  <br>  <br>  Another new concept in investing that has been getting good reviews is Nouveau Riche.  Its actually a COLLEGE for investors with 100 level all the way to 400 level classes.  Their website is <a href="http://www.nruniversity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nruniversity.com/</a> - may want to check into that too.<br>  <br>  Good luck and go get 'em :)|`|b2kK985Vaa	work for an investor, you cant just jump in and succeed. Everyone and their mother says they are an investor or a developer and none of them really are. Learn from someone who has succeeded and you will need a lot of capital|`|dROflhJ1aa	well you make money just by owning property because of what's called appreciation. meaning the value of what you own goes up depending on different factors. much like if you owned some baseball cards for years bought them for a nickel found out years later it's worth lots of money. same principle. so when you get ready to sell the property it's worth more than what you purchased it before, therefore you make a profit. someone once told me the best way to invest in real estate is not by using your own money, but other people's money. i found some great resources that can get you on your way.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://timboson.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://timboson.blogspot.com/</a>

4fb0f54f7bc9a3a63cf12e85f09c52d5aa	I think the book "7 Habbits of Highly Effective People" will provide a good business management overview and provide skills to excel in college.  <br>  <br>  "Crossing the Chasm" provides a good marketing and product innovations for new product introductions.<br>  <br>  Both are easy reads...  but good overview.|`|0VWnssp0aa	you must read "I can win" ,.
f132cbb00041baab410a089ee4cd5544aa	Well that would depend upon the terms of the sale you negotiated.<br>  <br>  If I were you I'd ask the seller to provide some type of documentation as to the weekly revenue generated as well as the operating costs, so then you'll have a basis upon which to prepare your offer to buy the route.  I would tell the seller that I wasn't willing to offer to buy the route if he or she didn't provide at least some of the documentation I requested.|`|MgCUnqHSaa	Depends on the route really........check the areas the machines are in.........vandalism and theft are the biggest risk of that business.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!
